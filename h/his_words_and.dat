25|$|Theodore Parker (August 24, 1810 – May 10, 1860) was an American Transcendentalist and {{reforming}} {{minister of}} the Unitarian church. A reformer and abolitionist, <b>his</b> <b>words</b> <b>and</b> popular quotations would later inspire speeches by Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King, Jr.|$|E
25|$|Traditions of {{the life}} of Muhammad and the early history of Islam were passed down mostly orally for {{more than a hundred years}} after Muhammad's death in AD 632. Muslim historians say that Caliph Uthman ibn Affan (the third khalifa (caliph) of the Rashidun Empire, or third {{successor}} of Muhammad, who had formerly been Muhammad's secretary), is generally believed to urge Muslims to record the hadith just as Muhammad suggested to some of his followers to write down <b>his</b> <b>words</b> <b>and</b> actions.|$|E
25|$|According to the Muslim tradition, Muhammad began {{receiving}} revelations {{at the age}} of 40. Some of {{his peers}} respected <b>his</b> <b>words</b> <b>and</b> became his followers. Many others, including tribal leaders, opposed, ridiculed and eventually boycotted his clan, and Muhammad and his followers were harassed, assaulted, tortured and forced into exile. Several attempts were made on his life. When his uncle and chief protector, Abu Talib, who {{was the head of the}} clan of Banu Hashim died, Muhammad migrated to Medina in 622, where he had many followers who agreed to help and assist him.|$|E

25|$|Mental {{prayer was}} defined by Fr. John Hardon in his Modern Catholic Dictionary {{as a form of}} prayer in which the sentiments {{expressed}} are one's own and not those of another person. Mental prayer is a form of prayer whereby one loves God through dialogue with him, meditating on <b>his</b> <b>words,</b> <b>and</b> contemplating him. It is a time of silence focused on God and one's relationship with him. It is distinguished from vocal prayers which use set prayers, although mental prayer can proceed by using vocal prayers in order to improve dialogue with God. Mental prayer can be divided into meditation, or active mental prayer; and contemplation, passive mental prayer.|$|E
25|$|A full {{investigation}} was conducted into the allegations by David Douglas– a former Metropolitan Police detective chief superintendent, {{and head of}} the WPBSA's disciplinary committee. The independent tribunal that followed on 7–8 September, hosted by Sports Resolutions (UK) and chaired by Ian Mill QC, concurred that the WPBSA was right to conclude that Higgins had truthfully accounted for <b>his</b> <b>words</b> <b>and</b> actions and to withdraw the more serious charges of match-fixing, but found him guilty of 'giving the impression' he would breach betting rules, and of failing to report the approach made by the News of the World. Higgins received a six-month ban, backdated to the start of his suspension period, and was fined £75,000.|$|E
25|$|The Cao Man Zhuan (曹瞞傳) and the Shiyu (世語) {{mentioned}} that Xiahou Dun once suggested to Cao Cao to eliminate Liu Bei first {{in order to}} force Sun Quan to surrender of his own accord, and then {{follow in the footsteps}} of the mythological rulers Shun and Yu by making Emperor Xian voluntarily abdicate the throne to him. Cao Cao accepted his proposal. After Cao Cao's death, Xiahou Dun regretted <b>his</b> <b>words</b> <b>and</b> fell sick and died. The historian Sun Sheng dismissed the Shiyu account as nonsense, saying that it did not match what was recorded in the main text of Xiahou Dun's biography in the Sanguozhi – Xiahou Dun felt ashamed of serving under the Han imperial court so he requested to serve in Cao Cao's vassal kingdom.|$|E

25|$|Plotinus {{wrote the}} essays {{that became the}} Enneads {{over a period of}} several years from ca. 253 until a few months before his death {{seventeen}} years later. Porphyry makes note that the Enneads, before being compiled and arranged by himself, were merely the enormous collection of notes and essays which Plotinus used in his lectures and debates, rather than a formal book. Plotinus was unable to revise his own work due to his poor eyesight, yet his writings required extensive editing, according to Porphyry: his master's handwriting was atrocious, he did not properly separate <b>his</b> <b>words,</b> <b>and</b> he cared little for niceties of spelling. Plotinus intensely disliked the editorial process, and turned the task to Porphyry, who not only polished them but put them into the arrangement we now have.|$|E
25|$|According to Tabata, Noctis' cool mannerisms and {{reserved}} exterior stem from his lonely childhood, {{in addition to}} a fear of losing those closest to him. <b>His</b> <b>words</b> <b>and</b> actions stem from a fear of disappointing those around him, causing him to work to both fulfill expectations and bring people happiness as a result. When comparing the personalities of Noctis and Lunafreya, Tabata referred to Noctis as the weaker of the two, remarking that {{he is the one who}} needs protection instead of her. A key part of his narrative is Noctis' transition from prince to king during his journey. According to scenario writer Saori Itamuro, Noctis faces the future as king with both dread and acceptance as he was brought up to expect such an event. This part of his story influenced aspects of his appearance.|$|E
25|$|Roberts backed {{a pickup}} truck {{up to the front}} of the Amish schoolhouse and entered the school at {{approximately}} 10:25a.m. EDT, shortly after the children had returned from recess. He asked the teacher, Emma Mae Zook, and the students if they had seen a missing clevis pin on the road. Survivors said that Roberts was mumbling <b>his</b> <b>words</b> <b>and</b> was not making direct eye contact. After the occupants of the classroom denied seeing a clevis pin, Roberts walked out to his truck and reappeared in the classroom holding a Springfield XD 9mm handgun. He ordered the boys to help him carry items into the classroom from the back of his pickup. Zook and her mother, who was visiting the schoolhouse, took this opportunity to escape the school and ran toward a nearby farm to get help. Roberts saw them leave, and ordered one of the boys to stop them, threatening to shoot everyone if the women got away.|$|E

25|$|A {{major element}} of Prompto's {{character}} is his humble origins {{when compared to}} Gladiolus and Ignis, expressing this in <b>his</b> <b>words</b> <b>and</b> actions. Prompto's facial features and hairstyle underwent multiple redesigns, the more recent ones based on negative feedback from fans, {{so that he would}} have international appeal. As {{with the rest of the}} party, he is dressed in black due to its specific significance to the Lucian royal family. The character was initially unpopular with series fans, so the team designed Prompto's photography hobby—and its subsequent gameplay and story interactions—as a way of making him useful and enabling each player to chronicle their journey through the game. Tabata later defined Prompto's camera as a manifestation of Prompto's wish to record Noctis and Lunafreya's journey. Prompto proved to be the starting point for Brotherhood, as producer Akio Ofuji conceived the series based around wanting to expand upon a backstory created by staff surrounding his difficult childhood. For Prompto's English performance, Inoue based him on the titular protagonist of Ferris Bueller's Day Off.|$|E
25|$|The trial, {{which opened}} in February 2003, centred on whether Baker had {{been aware of the}} {{contents}} of the suitcase as well as an examination of the interrogation records and the confession he had signed. Baker claimed that the statement was mispresentation of <b>his</b> <b>words</b> <b>and</b> his lawyer, Shunji Miyake, argued that since there was no video or audio recording of the interrogations, and no defence lawyer was present, {{there was no way to}} check whether falsifications and mistranslations had taken place. Miyake also questioned what he claimed were the 'leading nature' of the questions asked by the interrogators. Baker maintained that the bag was Prunier's, that he had never had the key to the case, and that he had been tricked into carrying the bag by Prunier. Prunier had been arrested for drug smuggling in Belgium a month after Baker's arrest, and his co-accused in the Belgian case had also claimed that Prunier had duped them into carrying bags with drugs. The court ruled the evidence from the Belgian police was inadmissible, and it was not introduced during the trial.|$|E
500|$|Despite his flaws, Saint-Just {{is often}} accorded {{respect for the}} {{strength}} of his convictions. Although <b>his</b> <b>words</b> <b>and</b> actions may be viewed as reprehensible, his commitment to them is rarely questioned: he was [...] "implacable but sincere". Like Robespierre, he was incorruptible {{in the sense that he}} exhibited no attraction to material benefits but devoted himself entirely to the advancement of a political agenda.|$|E

500|$|Gates {{later said}} he had simply {{resisted}} attempts by Boies to mischaracterize <b>his</b> <b>words</b> <b>and</b> actions. As to his demeanor during the deposition, he said, [...] "Did I fence with Boies? ... I plead guilty. Whatever that penalty is should be levied against me: rudeness to Boies in the first degree." [...] Despite Gates's denials, the judge ruled that Microsoft had committed monopolization and tying, and blocking competition, both {{in violation of the}} Sherman Antitrust Act.|$|E
500|$|Swift {{wrote out}} his sermons before preaching and marked his words {{to provide the}} correct {{pronunciation}} or to emphasise the word ironically. He always practised reading his sermons, and, as Davis claims, [...] "he would (in his own expression) pick up the lines, and cheat his people, by making them believe he had it all by heart." [...] However, he wanted to express the truth of <b>his</b> <b>words</b> <b>and</b> impart this truth in a down-to-earth manner that could be understood by his listeners.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the main}} themes in Le Père Goriot is the quest to {{understand}} and ascend society's strata. The Charter of 1814 granted by King Louis XVIII had established a [...] "legal country" [...] which allowed only {{a small group of}} the nation's most wealthy men to vote. Thus, Rastignac's drive to achieve social status is evidence not only of his personal ambition but also of his desire to participate in the body politic. As with Scott's characters, Rastignac epitomizes, in <b>his</b> <b>words</b> <b>and</b> actions, the Zeitgeist in which he lives.|$|E
500|$|While at Mercy, he {{developed}} a following for his [...] "wet clinics", in which he operated and lectured to an audience. Physicians {{from around the world}} attended these sessions. The only method for wider dissemination of these lectures and demonstrations was print publication. A secretary transcribed <b>his</b> <b>words,</b> <b>and</b> they were printed as [...] "The Surgical Clinics of John B. Murphy, M.D., at Mercy Hospital, Chicago". This became 'The Surgical Clinics of Chicago", and, subsequently, the [...] "Surgical Clinics of North America", which continue in publication in 2008.|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} sessions {{served as}} the first production credit for Scott-Heron, Jackson, and Jose Williams. As the third unofficial collaboration between Scott-Heron and Jackson, the album's recording featured more of Jackson's input than before. Jackson recounted the experience in an interview for All About Jazz, stating [...] "He had this way with words and I thought to myself, 'People have to hear this stuff'. What I had to offer was the music and I figured if we can take <b>his</b> <b>words</b> <b>and</b> make this tribal knowledge rhythmic and musical, we can draw people to hear it." ...|$|E
