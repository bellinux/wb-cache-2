H. larsenii can utilize {{a variety of}} carbohydrates such as fructose, glycerol, lactose, glucose, arabinose, acetate, ribose, starch, maltose, galactose, ribose, xylose, glutamate, and propionate as substrates for growth. Growth substrates were determined {{through the use of}} the <b>isolation</b> <b>medium,</b> which contained the substrate being tested along with yeast extract. [...] Additionally, H. larsenii undergoes assimilatory nitrate reduction to nitrite to ammonia. This process differs from nitrate reduction because it occurs aerobically and uses ferrodoxin as an electron donor.|$|E

Cold treatment {{had no effect}} on MA birefringence when MA were in <b>isolation</b> <b>medium,</b> but caused a 10 — 15 % reduction of MA birefringence when MA were in quarter-strength <b>isolation</b> <b>medium.</b> Pressure treatment also caused a reduction in MA birefringence, but the cold and pressure treatments were not additive, suggesting that both treatments affected the same MA component. MA were not stable in quarter-strength <b>isolation</b> <b>medium,</b> and birefringence gradually decayed, with a half-life of about 40 h. Electron microscopy after cold treatment, or after decay of 55 % of the MA birefringence showed abundant, normal-looking microtubules, suggesting that alterations in non-microtubule components cause the reductions in birefringence. Addition of EGTA eliminates the effect of cold treatment, suggesting that Cal+ has a role in maintenance of spindle structure.

The presence of MAP was detected by isolation and conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using IS 900 and F 57. Bacterial isolation were done by Herrold’s egg yolk medium with mycobactine J(HEYMj) and without mycobactin J (HEYM) and incubated at 37 °C for 20 weeks.

This medium, named rhizosphere <b>isolation</b> <b>medium,</b> contains glucose and 15 of the 20 common amino acids. The absence of five other amino acids, namely, aspartic acid, asparagine, cysteine, proline, and threonine, inhibits the growth of Bacillus mycoides, a commonly encountered bacterium that rapidly spreads on agar media and complicates the isolation and enumeration of other microorganisms. Compared with a similar medium containing Casamino Acids, rhizosphere <b>isolation</b> <b>medium</b> had half as many colonies of B. mycoides, with each colony approximately half the diameter. The two media had similar total numbers of bacterial colonies.

40|$|Washed whole chloroplasts of Spinacia oleracea {{isolated}} and assayed in a tris (hydroxymethyl aminomethane) -HCl buffered sucrose solution exhibited low dark CO 2 fixing activity, whereas washed whole chloroplasts {{isolated in the}} same buffer but assayed in that buffer without sucrose exhibited much greater dark CO 2 fixing activity. The lowered activity {{could be attributed to}} the impermeability of the chloroplast membrane to ribose- 5 -phosphate or adenosine triphosphate. The preservation of the integrity of the chloroplast membrane, as reflected by its impermeability to either or both of the abovementioned compounds, was measured by the fixation of 14 CO 2 into acid-stable products in the presence of ribose- 5 -phosphate and adenosine triphosphate by the whole chloroplast as compared with fixation by the chloroplast extract. An effect (i. e., apparent resistance to the passage of ribose- 5 -phosphate or adenosine- 5 -triphosphate into the chloroplast) similar to, but less pronounced than, that produced by the presence of sucrose in the <b>isolation</b> <b>medium</b> was observed upon the addition of MnCl 2 or CaCl 2 to the buffered sucrose <b>isolation</b> <b>medium.</b> The addition of KCl enhanced slightly the effect produced by addition of sucrose alone to the <b>isolation</b> <b>medium.</b> The presence of MgCl 2 in the <b>isolation</b> <b>medium,</b> however, either caused the chloroplasts to become leaky or more fragile since more of the activity of the carboxylative phase enzymes appeared in the cytoplasm.

The biochemical evaluation consisted of culture onto Sabouraud dextrose agar, catalase reaction, Tween assimilation, Cremophor EL assimilation, splitting of esculin and growth at 38 0 C. Results: Out of 58 microscopically diagnosed cases of PV, growth was obtained from 54 (93. 10 %) cases. The most frequently isolated species were M. globosa, M. sympodialis and M. furfur which made up 51. 79 %, 31. 42 % and 18. 51 % of the isolated etiological agents respectively.

Conclusions: M. globosa in its mycelial phase was the main etiological agent, but as normal flora from the back of healthy subjects, it was found in significantly less number (P = 0. 01), suggesting that the higher pathogenicity of M. globosa in terms of enzymatic endowment, might be the cause of its predominance in PV lesions...|$|R
