5|$|The system {{formed on}} a cold <b>front</b> <b>that</b> tracked across the Midwest and {{stretched}} from the northern Great Lakes to Tennessee. The front was enhanced by a strong jet stream and warm, humid air ahead of it, allowing thunderstorms to develop.

5|$|After January 1943 {{as part of}} the Southern <b>Front,</b> <b>that</b> {{became the}} 4th Ukrainian Front on 20 October 1943, the 51st Army took part in the Rostov, Donbass (August–September 1943), Melitopol (September–November 1943) and the 1944 Crimean {{offensive}} operation. On 1 April 1944, 51st Army included the 1st Guards Rifle Corps (33rd Guards, 91st and 346th Rifle Divisions), 10th Rifle Corps (216th, 257th, and 279th Rifle Divisions), 63rd Rifle Corps (263rd, 267th, and 417th Rifle Divisions), the 77th Rifle Division, the 78th Fortified Region, artillery, armor and other support units. During these operations, the 51st Army's attacks trapped the German XXIX. Armeekorps against the Sea of Azov.|$|E

5|$|After landfall, the cyclone {{accelerated}} in {{forward speed}} northward, weakening in intensity, and, by 1200UTC on October 12, Marco became an extra-tropical cyclone. It {{turned to the}} northeast and east through South Carolina, following behind Hurricane Lili to its northeast. For a time, the system's proximity to Lili resulted in hints of the Fujiwhara effect, in which two tropical cyclone appear to rotate around each other. The cold <b>front</b> <b>that</b> absorbed the weakening low was to the storm's north on October 13, though moisture from the remnants of Marco dropped heavy rainfall across the southeast United States for another day.|$|E
5|$|As the mesocyclone lowers {{below the}} cloud base, {{it begins to}} take in cool, moist air from the {{downdraft}} region of the storm. The convergence of warm air in the updraft and cool air causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to draw air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground. As the updraft intensifies, it creates an {{area of low pressure}} at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, {{in the form of a}} visible condensation funnel. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, fanning outward and creating a gust <b>front</b> <b>that</b> can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.|$|E

5|$|Despite these successes, {{there was}} {{criticism}} of Dragoon by some Allied generals and contemporary commentators such as Bernard Montgomery, Arthur R. Wilson, and Chester Wilmot in the aftermath, {{mostly because of}} its geo-strategic implications. It was argued that Dragoon diverted highly-experienced men and much-needed material away from the continuing fighting at the Western <b>front</b> <b>that</b> could have been used, instead, to bolster the Italian front or to hasten the advance towards the Rhine by the Overlord forces. The resulting loss of momentum gave Stalin on the Eastern Front a free hand to pursue his offensive efforts with more determination, allowing him to win the race towards Berlin and occupy the Balkans. Dragoon therefore had consequences reaching into the Cold War.|$|E

5|$|In early May, an upper-level trough dropped southward {{through the}} western Atlantic Ocean, forcing a {{back-door}} cold front—a cold <b>front</b> <b>that</b> moves southwestward {{ahead of a}} building surface ridge to its north or northeast—southward. For several days, forecast models had anticipated for the trough to evolve into a closed low pressure area, and on May 6, a frontal low with a large and well-defined circulation developed about 90miles (140km) east of Cape Hatteras. The low maintained scattered convection around its circulation center, and {{in conjunction with the}} strong high pressure to its north, a very tight pressure gradient produced gale-force winds near the coastline. The extratropical storm tracked southeastward and later turned to the southwest while steadily deepening; on May 7, it attained hurricane-force winds. With a lack of tropical moisture, its corresponding convection was minimal and scattered.|$|E

Although colugos also have a toothcomb, consisting of serrated edges on the tips of their incisors instead of finely spaced, elongated teeth, {{they do not have a}} sublingua. Instead, their toothcomb is cleaned by the tongue, which has serrated edges at the <b>front</b> <b>that</b> match the serrations on the incisors.|$|E
5|$|On 17 May, {{supported}} by Fliegerkorps VI, the German army took the initiative, as Kleist's 3rd Panzer Corps and 44th Army Corps began a counterattack on the Barvenkovo bridgehead {{from the area}} of Aleksandrovka in the south. Aided greatly by air support, Kleist was able to crush Soviet positions and advanced up to ten kilometres in {{the first day of}} the attack. Many of the Soviet units were sent to the rear that night to be refitted, while others were moved forward to reinforce tenuous positions across the <b>front.</b> <b>That</b> same day, Timoshenko reported the move to Moscow and asked for reinforcements and described the day's failures. Vasilevsky's attempts to gain approval for a general withdrawal were rejected by Stalin.|$|E
40|$|We use the CDIMA {{chemical}} reaction and the Lengyel–Epstein model of this reaction to study resonant responses of a pattern-forming system to time-independent spatial periodic forcing. We {{focus on the}} 2 : 1 resonance, where the wavenumber of a one-dimensional periodic forcing is about twice the wavenumber of the natural stripe pattern that the unforced system tends to form. Within this resonance, we study transverse <b>fronts</b> <b>that</b> shift the phase of resonant stripe patterns by π. We identify phase <b>fronts</b> <b>that</b> shift the phase discontinuously, and pairs of phase <b>fronts</b> <b>that</b> shift the phase continuously, clockwise and anti-clockwise. We further identify a <b>front</b> bifurcation <b>that</b> destabilizes the discontinuous front and leads {{to a pair of}} continuous fronts. This bifurcation is the spatial counterpart of the nonequilibrium Ising–Bloch (NIB) bifurcation in temporally forced oscillatory systems. The spatial NIB bifurcation that we find occurs as the forcing strength is increased, unlike earlier studies of the NIB bifurcation. Furthermore, the bifurcation is subcritical, implying a range of forcing strength where both discontinuous Ising fronts and continuous Bloch fronts are stable. Finally, we find <b>that</b> both Ising <b>fronts</b> and Bloch fronts can form discrete families of bound pairs, and we relate arrays of these front pairs to extended rectangular and oblique patterns...|$|R

5|$|A set {{procedure}} {{was used by}} a division that was moving into the front line.

Detachments from the divisional artillery group would move forward and were attached to the artillery batteries of the division they were relieving. Five days later, the infantry battalions that were destined for the front line sent forward their specialists from the Lewis gun teams, and the grenade officer, the machine gun officer, the four company commanders, and some of the signallers to take over the trench stores and settle into the trench routine before the battalions moved in. Overnight, the battalions would move into the line, and the artillery would take over the guns that were already in position, leaving theirs behind to be taken over by the batteries that had been relieved.|$|E
