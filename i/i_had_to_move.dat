2500|$|Connolly {{also bought}} a house in Windsor, Berkshire. [...] "I left Scotland and came to live here, because of the {{break-up}} of my marriage," [...] Connolly said in 1992. [...] "I had done everything {{that it was possible to}} do — well, certainly everything I wanted to do. I had filled the concert halls, I had done the television that I wanted to do, and I'd done the film that I wanted to do. And in order to grow, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> away. I'm still as big there as I ever was. Bigger, probably, but I don't live there anymore and don't go there as often as I used to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think you}} have lost weight at all," [...] the {{corporal}} said; [...] "it {{seems to me that}} you have grown and widened out, in the two months and, only yesterday, when I was sizing the company, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> you two men higher; for a young 'un, you stand the fatigues well." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{after that}} they went upstairs. I had a basket in the hall, which had belonged to Bob, the dog who had got poisoned. It was a {{comfortable}} basket, but I was so excited at having met Fred again that I couldn't sleep. Besides, there was a smell of mice somewhere, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> around, trying to place it.|$|E

60|$|Twice I {{stopped and}} spoke to 'er, {{but it was no}} good. Other people stopped too, and <b>I</b> <b>'ad</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on agin; and every step was {{bringing}} me nearer to my house and the missus.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} find out who it is that built this dam, and who it is that filled the hole I made in it! I'm {{going to find}} out if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> up here and live all summer!"

60|$|At the {{beginning}} of December <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to a nursing-home at the Convent of the Sisters of the Cross at the adjacent village of Hayle, just across the estuary. The Convent buildings and grounds and gardens are fortunately outside the ugly village, and my room had an exceptionally big window occupying almost the whole wall on one side, with an outlook to the south over the green fields and moors towards Helston. An ideal sick-room {{for a man who}} can't be happy without the company of birds, and here, even when lying on my bed before I was able to sit or stand by the window, {{a large portion of the}} sky, rainy or blue, was visible, and rooks and daws and gulls and troops of starlings, and the curlews from the river, were seen coming and going all day long.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now it's a {{fact that}} Jimmy wouldn't do me a good turn {{if he had the}} chance; but this time he surely saved my life by being just where he was, for if Mr. Towser hadn't stopped he'd surely caught me on the meadow where there isn't the least little bit of a chance to dodge. Even as it was, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> my feet mighty fast in order to keep ahead of him, and when we came {{to the edge of the}} woods I was leading by four or five lengths, with the odds big in my favor because of the bushes. But I had to keep on moving all the time, just the same, and was {{precious}} near being winded when, slaperty, bang! I fell into a hole, nearly scraping the skin from one ear as I struck the bottom.|$|E
6000|$|... "It nearly took {{my breath}} away, for if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> such a stone I'd want a wheelbarrow. Then {{he took another}} of the rocks and hurled it {{right on top of}} the first one, and it came down so hard that it split itself in half. And then he took up the third one, which was the biggest, and threw it nearly as far, but it didn't hit the others. 'Now, Mr. Matlack,' says he, 'this is the first part of my little programme. I have only one or two more things, and I don't want to keep you long.' Then he went and got a hickory sapling that he'd cut down. It was just the trunk part of it, and must have been at least three inches thick. He put the middle of it {{at the back of his}} neck, and then he took hold of the two ends with his hands and pulled forward, and, by George! he broke that stick right in half! ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2014, Rollins {{admitted}} a {{disdain for}} rehashing old {{music for the}} sake of it – [...] "I don’t want to play old music. To me, it is fighting battles that are already over and calling yourself a warrior. For me, I see no courage or adventure in doing the old thing over again. If others want to, that’s for them. For myself, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on. Life is too short to live in the past. There is a lot to be done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Captain Wopper," [...] said Mrs Roby, {{putting her}} hand {{lightly on the}} Captain's arm as it lay on the table, and looking earnestly into his face, [...] "if you had not been an old and valued friend of my dear Willie-- which I learn that you are from his letter--I would have said your remark was a rude one; but, being what you are, I don't mind telling you that I save up every penny I can scrape {{together}} for little Netta White, the girl that has just gone out to fetch the butter. Although she's not well cared for,--owing to her mother, who's a washerwoman, bein' overburdened with work and a drunken husband,--she's one of the dearest creeters I ever did see. Bless you, sir, you'd be amazed if you knew all the kind and thoughtful things that untrained and uncared for child does, and never thinks she's doing anything more than other people. It's all along of her mother's spirit, which {{is as good as}} gold. Some months ago Little Netta happened to be up here when I was at tea, and, seeing the difficulty <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> about with my old rheumatic limbs, she said she'd come and set out my tea and breakfast for me; and she's done it, sir, from that time to this, expecting nothing fur it, and thinking I'm too poor to give her anything. But she's mistaken," [...] continued Mrs Roby, with a triumphant twinkle in her black eyes, [...] "she doesn't know that I've made a confidant of her brother Gillie, and give him a sixpence now and then to give to his mother without telling where he got it, and she doesn't know that I'm saving up to be able to leave something to her when I'm called home--it can't be long, now; it can't be long." ...|$|E

5000|$|At {{the end of}} 1964, {{after losing}} {{three out of four}} fights, Ellis decided to leave Bruner. He later {{recalled}} Bruner fondly.

5000|$|In 2005 Staples {{embarked}} on a solo career and there was resultant speculation that the band had split. Staples has so far produced two solo albums, Lucky Dog Recordings 03-04 and Leaving Songs. The title of the second album, and Staples' notes on it, indicated that change was in the air: [...] "These are songs written {{on the verge of}} leaving the things I loved and stepping into a new unknown life, both musically and personally. I was always aware that these songs were the end of something, a kind of closing a circle of a way of writing that I started so long ago and I knew <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on from." ...|$|E

In 1997 he toured Spain and met and performed with his hero, flamenco master Paco de Lucía who aided him in applying for a visa {{to go to the}} United States. Goryachev said, [...] "I met Paco when I was touring Spain and I played for him at his home. He said that I sounded very good, but if I wanted to play flamenco <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to Spain. I never managed to do that." [...] His repertoire now also includes the music of other flamenco masters such as Vicente Amigo, Manolo Sanlucar and Rafael Riqueni.|$|E

60|$|From {{that time}} I enjoyed the play. But {{the first thing}} I knew the curtain came down, like that, without my notice, and--I hadn't any boots on. What's more, they wouldn't go on.

5000|$|Stellar Wind {{began her}} three-year-old {{season with a}} step up in class, as she contested the Grade III) Santa Ysabel Stakes over {{eight and a half}} furlongs at Santa Anita Park on February 25. Ridden for the first time by Victor Espinoza, she started at odds of 7/1 in a seven-horse field, headed by Light The City, who had {{finished}} second in the Grade I Las Virgenes Stakes in her previous start. The filly started slowly, but moved up on the outside on the final turn, took a narrow lead early in the stretch, and drew away in the final stages to win by two and three quarter lengths from Light The City. After the race, Espinoza commented: [...] "I wanted to break and let her do whatever she wanted to do. I didn't want to irritate her, just make her happy. They slowed the pace down, so <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> out a bit. They were walking up front, so I had to press the pace by the three-eighths pole. She was just waiting for me to command her".|$|E
50|$|Ethnographic {{method has}} {{used in this}} {{research}} to provide an in-depth understanding of the current notion of Ijtema in Bangladesh. Participant observation, which is the main tool of ethnographic approach, provided a deep insight into the movement and challenging {{some of the more}} homogenous accounts of Islamisation portrayed in Bangladesh. This study adopted multi-sited ethnographic method to explore TJ movement (Marcus 1995). Here, it would not be possible to understand this movement conducting traditional single site fieldwork, because the basic principle of Tablighi Jamaat is to move in various places, so <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> with them in different sites and location to get the holistic perspectives of the movement. The total length of the fieldwork was ten months in Bangladesh with an interval of five months.Apart, form this day-to-day participant observation I used case studies, in-depth interviews, focus group discussions (FGDs), and informal discussion to gain a holistic perspectives of the movement. In-depth interviews has conducted among selected TJ followers both male and female, religious leaders, leaders of other leading Islamic movements, people from the different social class and TJ organisers at local, national and transnational level.|$|E
5000|$|For {{about four}} months in 1998, Cantrell locked himself in his home to write the 25 songs. He noted {{that much of the}} songwriting was {{inspired}} by the demise of Alice in Chains, describing it as [...] "looking at a situation where <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on, and not really being happy about it[...] [...] So it was just coming to grips with all that stuff - and I'm still doing it, especially now that Layne's gone." [...] Consequently, Degradation Trip boasts various dark themes and bleak visuals. Songs like [...] "Bargain Basement Howard Hughes" [...] and [...] "Pig Charmer" [...] directly relate to the relationship between Cantrell and former bandmate Layne Staley. [...] "Owned" [...] and [...] "Pro False Idol" [...] question the career of Cantrell and his status as a musician, while [...] "Feel the Void" [...] and [...] "31/32" [...] explore the concept of lives wasted. Cantrell elaborated, [...] "Throughout the process of making this record, I often wondered at times whether I was insane or not. Sitting here, thinking back on it now, I probably had my moments." [...] He also noted, however, the satisfaction in having released the album as he wanted and being able to put all of the intimate expression to bed.|$|E
