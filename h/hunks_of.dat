25|$|In {{the absence}} of legal-tender laws, metal coin money will freely {{exchange}} at somewhat above bullion market value. This may be observed in bullion coins such as the Canadian Gold Maple Leaf, the South African Krugerrand, the American Gold Eagle, or even the silver Maria Theresa thaler (Austria). Coins of this type are of a known purity and are in a convenient form to handle. People prefer trading in coins rather than in anonymous <b>hunks</b> <b>of</b> precious metal, so they attribute more value to the coins of equal weight.|$|E
25|$|Two {{such places}} were Kanton and Enderbury Islands. The Taney {{played a role}} in their {{colonization}} by the United States. In early March 1938, the Coast Guard cutter loaded supplies and embarked colonists who would establish the claim of the United States upon the two islands that seemed—at least to the uninitiated—to be mere <b>hunks</b> <b>of</b> coral, rock, and scrub in the Central Pacific. She disembarked four Hawaiians at Enderbury Island on 6 March 1938 and landed a second contingent—of seven colonists—at Canton Island on the next day. The men, assisted by the Coast Guardsmen, erected buildings and laid the foundations for future signal towers.|$|E

500|$|NME called Animals [...] "one of {{the most}} extreme, relentless, {{harrowing}} and downright iconoclastic <b>hunks</b> <b>of</b> music {{to have been made}} available this side of the sun", and Melody Maker Karl Dallas described it as an [...] "uncomfortable taste of reality in a medium that has become in recent years, increasingly soporific". [...] Rolling Stone Frank Rose was unimpressed, writing: [...] "The 1977 Floyd has turned bitter and morose. [...] They complain about the duplicity of human behavior (and then title their songs after animals – get it?). [...] They sound like they've just discovered this – their message has become pointless and tedious." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice gave the album a [...] "B+" [...] rating and found the negative reaction overly cynical, reasoning that the album functions simply as [...] "a piece of well-constructed political program music... lyrical, ugly, and rousing, all in the right places".|$|E
500|$|Cyclopean is {{the term}} {{normally}} applied to the masonry characteristics of Mycenaean fortification systems and describes walls built of large, unworked boulders more than [...] thick and weighing several metric tonnes. They were roughly fitted together {{without the use of}} mortar or clay to bind them, though smaller <b>hunks</b> <b>of</b> limestone fill the interstices. Their placement formed a polygonal pattern giving the curtain wall an irregular but imposing appearance. At the top it would have been wide enough for a walkway with a narrow protective parapet on the outer edge and with hoop-like crenellations. The term Cyclopean was derived by the latter Greeks of the Classical era who believed that only the mythical giants, the Cyclopes, could have constructed such megalithic structures. On the other hand, cut stone masonry is used only in and around gateways. Another typical feature of Mycenaean megalithic construction was the use of a relieving triangle above a lintel block—an opening, often triangular, designed to reduce the weight over the lintel. The space was filled with some lighter stone.|$|E

2500|$|The {{high winds}} of the {{blizzard}} packed the snow so tightly and high, drifts reached [...] in places; normal snow removal equipment was ineffective, and earth-moving equipment, such as front-end loaders, {{had to be}} used. Colonel Daniel Ludwig of the USACE stated the [...] "snow was very densely packed and that snow plows would be virtually useless {{on most of the}} roads". NWS meteorologist Ben Kolker noted on one of the roads near the NWS forecast office, high lifts were used [...] "to dig away at it and break it up like big <b>hunks</b> <b>of</b> rock". In Depew, a suburb of Buffalo, volunteer firemen used a trenching machine to get people out of a house that had been drifted shut. The long cleanup period included the railroads, who used front-end loaders to clear snow from the rail yard into open-bodied rail cars and shipped it east by Conrail.|$|E

2500|$|Precipitated by an {{unhealthy}} weight, dehydration, bad eating habits, {{and a recent}} relapse on the Grateful Dead's first stadium tour, Garcia collapsed into a diabetic coma in July 1986, waking up five days later. He later spoke about this period of unconsciousness as surreal: [...] "Well, I had some very weird experiences. My main experience was one of furious activity and tremendous struggle {{in a sort of}} futuristic, space-ship vehicle with insectoid presences. After I came out of my coma, I had this image of myself as these little <b>hunks</b> <b>of</b> protoplasm that were stuck together kind of like stamps with perforations between them that you could snap off." [...] Garcia's coma {{had a profound effect on}} him: it forced him to have to relearn how to play the guitar, as well as other, more basic skills. Within a handful of months, he had recovered, playing with the Jerry Garcia Band and the Grateful Dead again later that year.|$|E

2500|$|During early production, Age of Empires Online was {{originally}} called Age of Empires IV. The development team {{had noticed that}} many other RTS game developers had {{moved away from the}} [...] "economic game". The team felt that [...] had blended the economic and military aspects of the game perfectly, so they decided to play test it with hindsight. They noticed that many features had been lost or changed over time. It was during this time the team decided to do an [...] "Age of Kings style gameplay in an Age of Empires setting". The designers were surprised that fans of the series were most fond of the simpler aspects of the previous titles. Former Age of Empires II lead designer Ian M. Fischer stated, [...] "When we started floating some of the early [...] out to people other pieces fell into place – I cannot tell you how many times I have had someone email me or talk to me at a show and mention how much they loved the villagers carrying big <b>hunks</b> <b>of</b> meat in the original Age or the priest [...] "wololo"". From that point on, one of the goals was to invoke nostalgia from fans of the series when playing the game, despite the newer and updated features.|$|E
2500|$|The hunting methods {{utilized}} by saltwater crocodiles are indistinct {{from any other}} crocodilian, with the hunting crocodile submerging and quietly swimming over to the prey before pouncing upwards striking suddenly. Unlike some other crocodilians, such as alligators and even Nile crocodiles, they are not known to have hunted on dry land. Young saltwater crocodiles are capable of breaching their entire body into the air in a single upward motion while hunting prey that may be perched on low hanging branches. While hunting rhesus macaques, crocodiles have been seen to knock the monkeys off a bank by knocking them with their tail, forcing the macaque into water for easy consumption. However, whether tail use in hunting is intentional or just an accidental benefit is not definitely clear. As with other crocodilians, their sharp, peg-like teeth are well-suited to seize and tightly grip prey, but not designed to shear flesh. Small prey are simply swallowed whole, while larger animals are forcibly dragged into deep water and drowned or crushed. Large prey is then torn into manageable pieces by [...] "death rolling" [...] (the spinning of the crocodile to twist off <b>hunks</b> <b>of</b> meat) or by sudden jerks of the head. Occasionally, food items will be stored for later consumption once a crocodile eats its fill, although {{this can lead to}} scavenging by interlopers such as monitor lizards.|$|E

However, we ate the <b>hunks</b> <b>of</b> hot, dry meat with bread, and were glad to get them. They were filling, at least. And there was a bowl of rather bitter green olives for a condiment.|$|E
