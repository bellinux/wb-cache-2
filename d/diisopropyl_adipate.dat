5000|$|The Environmental Working Group (EWG) and New York Senator Chuck Schumer {{have called}} {{attention}} to the fact that high doses of topical retinyl palmitate were shown to accelerate cancer in lab animals, fueling the sunscreen controversy in the popular press. One toxicological analysis determined that [...] "there is no convincing evidence to support the notion that palmitate in sunscreens is carcinogenic." [...] EWG disputed the findings, calling the report [...] "faulty" [...] and [...] "misleading." [...] A technical report issued thereafter by the National Toxicology Program concluded that <b>diisopropyl</b> <b>adipate</b> increased incidence of skin tumors in mice, and the addition of either retinoic acid or retinyl palmitate both exacerbated the rate and frequency of tumors.|$|E
40|$|For the {{construction}} of the phase diagrams, the method of the aqueous titration was used. There were prepared 5 ternary diagrams, varying the surfactant and the oil phase. The liquid-crystalline phases were identified by polarized light microscopy. The formulations prepared with silicon glycol copolymer, polyether functional siloxane (PFS) and water (S 1) and with <b>diisopropyl</b> <b>adipate,</b> PFS and water (S 4) presented liquid-crystalline phases with lamellar arrangement. Moreover, after 15 days in hot oven (37 ºC), the formulations presented hexagonal arrangement, evidencing the influence of the temperature in the organization of the system...|$|E
40|$|The {{percutaneous}} absorption characteristics of isotretinoin, etretinate, tretinoin, and acitretin were investigated in vitro {{to assess the}} feasibility of their topical application for dermatological disorders The influence of vehicle, photodegradation, and dose was examined. Retinoid absorption through monkey skin was highly vehicle dependent and followed the order: propylene glycol = isopropyl alcohol > mineral oil > <b>diisopropyl</b> <b>adipate</b> > polytheylen glycol 400. Peak flux of etretinate (an ester) was less than 50 % that of the acid retinoids in boght human and monkey skin. Exposure to light caused a 60 % degradation of isotretinoin o {{on the surface of}} the skin, but did not change the amount of drug which penetrated the epidermis. In accord with this result, the amount of isotretinoin and acitretin which penetrated epidermis did not increase in proportion to dose over a 25 - fold range of dose in human skin. Dermal concentration at doses of 10 μg/cm 2 of isotretinoin and acitretin were greater than that reported for shave biopsies of human skin following treatment for several months with clinically effective doses of isotretinoin and etretinate (the parent ester of the acid acitretin) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{stabilization}} of o/w Pickering emulsions {{in cases of}} weak adsorption of solid particles at the surface of oil droplets is addressed. Though the adsorption is usually very strong and irreversible when partial wetting conditions are fulfilled, electrostatic repulsions between charged solid particles act against the adsorption. The regime of weak adsorption was reached using charged silica nanoparticles at high pH and low ionic strength. O/w Pickering emulsions of the <b>diisopropyl</b> <b>adipate</b> oil were stabilized by colloidal nanoparticles of Ludox® AS 40 consisting of non-aggregated particles of bare silica (hydrophilic). The combination of stability assessment, droplet size and electrokinetic potential measurements at various pH values, adsorption isotherms and cryo-SEM observations of the adsorbed layers disclosed the specificities of the {{stabilization of}} Pickering emulsions by adsorption of solid nanoparticles against strong electrostatic repulsions. Not only the long-term stability of emulsions was poor under strong electrostatic repulsions at high pH, but emulsification failed since full dispersion of oil could not be achieved. Emulsion stability was ensured by decreasing electrostatic repulsions by lowering the pH from 9 to 3. Stable emulsions were stabilized by a monolayer of silica particles at 54 % coverage of the oil droplet surface at low silica content and an adsorption regime as multilayers was reached at higher concentrations of silica {{although there was no}} aggregation of silica in the bulk aqueous phase...|$|E
40|$|The {{well-known}} dynamic kinetic resoln. {{of secondary}} alcs. and esters {{was extended to}} secondary diols and diesters to afford chiral polyesters. This process {{is an example of}} iterative tandem catalysis (ITC), a polymn. method where the concurrent action of two fundamentally different catalysts is required to achieve chain growth. In order to procure chiral polyesters of high enantiomeric excess value (ee) and good mol. wt., the catalysts employed need to be complementary and compatible during the polymn. reaction. We here show that Shvo's catalyst and Novozym 435 fulfil these requirements. The optimal polymn. conditions of 1, 1 '-(1, 3 -phenylene) diethanol (1, 3 -diol) and <b>diisopropyl</b> <b>adipate</b> required 2 mol% Shvo's catalyst and 12 mg Novozym 435 per mmol alc. group in the presence of 0. 5 M 2, 4 -dimethyl- 3 -pentanol as the hydrogen donor. With these conditions, chiral polyesters were obtained with peak mol. wts. up to 15 kDa, an ee value up to 99 % and with 1 - 3 % ketone end groups. Also with the structural isomer, 1, 4 -diol, a chiral polyester was obtained, albeit with lower mol. wt. (8. 3 kDa) and slightly lower ee (94 %). Aliph. secondary diols also resulted in enantio-enriched polymers but at most an ee of 46 % was obtained with mol. wts. in the range of 3. 3 - 3. 7 kDa. This low ee originates from the intrinsic low enantioselectivity of Novozym 435 for this type of secondary aliph. diols. The results presented here show that ITC can be applied to procure chiral polyesters with good mol. wt. and high ee from optically inactive AA-BB type monomers. [on SciFinder (R) ...|$|E
