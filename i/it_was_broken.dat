5|$|Stela 2 is {{believed}} to date to around AD 870 although it bears no hieroglyphic text. It depicts the frontal view of a masked figure {{and is the only}} monument at Seibal to show a frontal portrayal. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>broken</b> into six or seven pieces and has been restored.|$|E
5|$|The UBS scheme {{involved}} multiple banks, {{brokers and}} traders to manipulate {{interest rates to}} generate a profit on trades. The scheme lasted for six years before <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>broken</b> up. UBS entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice, following which {{it was not a}} subject of criminal charges, except for company's subsidiary, UBS Securities Japan, which was not exempt. The subsidiary pleaded guilty to wire fraud.|$|E
5|$|The University of Paris, {{founded in}} the 12th century, is often called the Sorbonne after one of its {{original}} medieval colleges. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>broken</b> up into thirteen autonomous universities in 1970, following the student demonstrations in 1968. Most of the campuses today are in the Latin Quarter where the old university was located, while others are scattered around {{the city and the}} suburbs.|$|E

5|$|As in the {{previous}} years, there were two classes of cyclists, the coureurs de vitesse and the coureurs sur machines poinçonnées. Of the 93 cyclists starting the race, 82 were in the poinçonnée category, which meant {{that they had to}} finish the race on the same bicycle as they left, and if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>broken</b> they had to fix it without assistance. The coureurs de vitesse could get help from the car with bicycle repairmen when they had to fix a bicycle, and when a bicycle was beyond repair, they could change it to a new one.|$|E
5|$|During the mid 1990s, Ramiz Sadiku was docked {{for a major}} {{overhaul}} and reconstruction. However, {{due to the lack}} of funds the work was never completed and the boat was decommissioned and eventually sold for scrap. The boat's superstructure, propulsion, sensors and weapon systems were dismantled, after which the new owner moved the boat to an underground naval dock on the Luštica peninsula. The boat remained there for several years, before its deteriorating condition caused it to sink inside the dock. The wreck was raised in 2014 and towed to Zelenika where <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>broken</b> up to smaller segments which were then transported to the Nikšić steel factory.|$|E
5|$|In {{her later}} years, the Queen Mother became {{known for her}} longevity. Her 90th birthday—4 August 1990—was celebrated by a parade on 27 June that {{involved}} many of the 300 organisations of which she was patron. In 1995, she attended events commemorating {{the end of the}} war fifty years before, and had two operations: one to remove a cataract in her left eye, and one to replace her right hip. In 1998, her left hip was replaced after <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>broken</b> when she slipped and fell during a visit to Sandringham stables.|$|E

5|$|John Carpenter (born c. 1968) is an American {{game show}} {{contestant}} and IRS agent. He {{is best known}} for becoming the first top prize winner on the United States version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. He held the record for the largest single win in United States game show history, until <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>broken</b> by Rahim Oberholtzer who won $1.12million on another U.S. quiz show, Twenty One. Carpenter was also the first top prize winner among all international versions of the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? series.|$|E
5|$|Perry's {{durability}} {{allowed him}} to play in three separate decades, from the 1940s to the 1960s, for sixteen seasons. He was the NFL's career rushing leader from 1958 to 1963, ultimately compiling 8,378 yards; his record was broken by Jim Brown on October 20, 1963. His 7,344 rushing yards for the 49ers stood as the franchise record for nearly 60 years before <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>broken</b> in 2011 by Frank Gore. As of 2016, Perry's 68 rushing touchdowns with the team remains a franchise record.|$|E
5|$|Stela 11 was {{originally}} an interior column from Temple 18, the funerary shrine of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat. When it was found, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>broken</b> {{in two parts}} {{at the base of}} the temple. It portrays the king as the elderly Maya maize god and has imagery that seems to deliberately parallel the tomb lid of the Palenque king K'inich Janaab' Pakal, probably because of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat's close family ties to that city. The text of the column formed part of a longer text carved onto the interior walls of the temple and may describe the downfall of the Copán dynasty.|$|E

5|$|Tipu's Tiger was {{originally}} made for Tipu Sultan (also {{referred to as}} Tippoo Saib, Tippoo Sultan and other epithets in nineteenth-century literature) in the Kingdom of Mysore (today in the Indian state of Karnataka) around 1795. Tipu Sultan used the tiger systematically as his emblem, employing tiger motifs on his weapons, on the uniforms of his soldiers, and on the decoration of his palaces. His throne rested upon a probably similar life-size wooden tiger, covered in gold; like other valuable treasures <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>broken</b> up for the highly organised prize fund shared out between the British army.|$|E
5|$|At the Middle Preclassic city of Nakbe in {{the central}} lowlands, Maya sculptors were {{producing}} {{some of the earliest}} lowland Maya stelae, depicting richly dressed individuals. Nakbe Stela1 has been dated to around 400BC. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>broken</b> into pieces, but originally represented two elaborately dressed figures facing each other, and perhaps represents the transference of power from one ruler to his successor, however it also has features that recall the myth of the Maya Hero Twins, and would be the earliest known presentation of them. Around 200BC the enormous nearby city of ElMirador had started to erect stela-like monuments, bearing inscriptions that appear to be glyphs but that are so far unreadable. Stela dating to the Late Preclassic period are also known from the sites of El Tintal, Cival, and San Bartolo in Guatemala, and Actuncan and Cahal Pech in Belize.|$|E

5|$|During {{the course}} of his expeditions Beebe {{gradually}} developed an interest in marine biology, ultimately leading to his 1930s dives in the Bathysphere, along with its inventor, Otis Barton, off the coast of Bermuda. This was the first time a biologist observed deep-sea animals in their native environment, and set several successive records for the deepest dive ever performed by a human, the deepest of which stood until <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>broken</b> by Barton 15 years later. Following his Bathysphere dives, Beebe returned to the tropics and began to focus his study on the behavior of insects. In 1949, he founded a tropical research station in Trinidad which he named Simla, and which remains in operation as part of the Asa Wright Nature Centre. Beebe's research at Simla continued until his death from pneumonia in 1962 at the age of 84.|$|E
5|$|Gail Kim {{defended the}} TNA Women's Knockout Championship against Awesome Kong in a No Disqualification match. It {{began with the}} two {{fighting}} throughout the crowd, before entering the ring. There, Kong performed her signature Awesome Bomb maneuver on the referee and followed by hitting him with a steel chair. Kim took the steel chair from Kong, bashed her over the back and head with it, before getting a near-fall which was counted by a replacement referee. Kong then proceeded to try an Awesome Bomb on the second referee, but was stopped by Kim as she attempted a roll-up pin {{which led to the}} three count and the retaining of the TNA Women's Knockout Championship at twelve minutes and forty-four seconds. Following the contest, Kong and Kim fought at ringside before <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>broken</b> up by security.|$|E
5|$|Several Phillies hold National League {{and major}} league records. Pitcher/outfielder John Coleman {{is the most}} {{decorated}} in this category, holding three major league records, all from the franchise's inaugural season. Coleman set records for losses, earned runs allowed, and hits allowed, all in 1883 when he also set three additional franchise pitching records. Shortstop Jimmy Rollins broke Willie Wilson's record for at-bats in a single season with 716 in 2007, and first baseman Ryan Howard also set the major league record for strikeouts in a single season that same year with 199, before <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>broken</b> by Mark Reynolds of the Arizona Diamondbacks the following year. The 1930 Phillies, who went 52–102, set two more National League records, allowing 1,993 hits and 1,193 runs in the regular season.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} season, Smith's run of {{consecutive games}} {{came to an}} end against Reading in October 1958, with Jim McCusker coming into the side to replace him for two games. Smith's number of consecutive appearances is third on the club's list behind Mulholland's 231 games and Charlie Bicknell. He played 26 further games in the 1958–59 season, in which the club finished 11th in the newy-formed Third Division. The season proved to be Smith's final season for City as he decided to retire aged 31. His last game was a 2–1 defeat, once again versus Reading, on 28 February 1959. When the season finished, Smith had played a total of 270 games for the club, 253 of which came in the league, keeping a club record 70 clean sheets. His record stood until <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>broken</b> by Paul Tomlinson in the 1990s. When Smith retired, the club granted him and Mulholland each a sum of money rather than the proceeds of a benefit match.|$|E
5|$|The last {{member of}} the Hungerford family to hold the castle, Sir Edward Hungerford, {{inherited}} it in 1657, but his gambling and expensive living forced him to sell the property in 1686. By the 18th century the castle was no longer lived in by its owners and fell into disrepair; in 1730 it was bought by the Houlton family, when much of <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>broken</b> up for salvage. Antiquarian and tourist interest in the now ruined castle increased through the 18th and 19th centuries. The castle chapel was repaired in 1779 and became a museum of curiosities, complete with the murals rediscovered on its walls in 1844 {{and a number of}} rare lead anthropomorphic coffins from the mid-17th century. In the 1915 Farleigh Hungerford Castle was sold to the Office of Works and a controversial restoration programme began. It is now owned by English Heritage, who operate it as a tourist attraction, and the castle is a Grade I listed building and a Scheduled Ancient Monument.|$|E
5|$|Vs. debuted {{at the top}} of the Billboard 200 album {{chart and}} stayed there for five weeks. Vs. sold 950,378copies in its first five days of release, which set a record for the most copies of an album sold in its first week of release and {{outperformed}} all other entries in the Billboard top ten that week combined. Vs. held this record for five years before <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>broken</b> by Garth Brooks' 1998 album, Double Live. While Double Live officially beat Vs. in first week sales, Vs. still holds an unbreakable record in that SoundScan only counted the first five days of an album's release in its first week sales until 1998. Vs. has been certified seven times platinum by the RIAA, and, as of July 2013, has sold 6,010,000 copies in the United States according to Nielsen SoundScan.|$|E
