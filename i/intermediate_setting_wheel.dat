40|$|We {{introduce}} the <b>intermediate</b> <b>set</b> as an interpolating solution concept between {{the core and}} the Weber set of a coalitional game. The new solution {{is defined as the}} limiting superdifferential of the Lovasz extension and thus it completes the hierarchy of variational objects used to represent the core (Frechet superdifferential) and the Weber set (Clarke superdifferential). It is shown that the <b>intermediate</b> <b>set</b> is a non-convex solution containing the Pareto optimal payoff vectors that depend on some chain of coalitions and marginal coalitional contributions with respect to the chain. A detailed comparison between the <b>intermediate</b> <b>set</b> and other set-valued solutions is provided.
