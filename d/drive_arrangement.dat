500|$|The Gresley 3-cylinder <b>drive</b> <b>arrangement</b> {{continued}} {{to bring a}} number of practical problems, the root of which was probably {{the need for the}} inside cylinder to be steeply inclined in order to give space for the inside connecting rod to clear the leading coupled axle; at the same time, the inside valve spindle had to be parallel with the outside ones from which it derived its motion. This problem had been overcome by what Holcroft called a [...] "twist in the ports" [...] (the passages that carried steam {{in and out of the}} cylinders). A consequence was that the length of these passages was greater than that generally recommended, increasing [...] "dead space", and this was combined with a shorter exhaust passage. The net result would be rather different working conditions in the middle cylinder from those on the outside. A contributing problem was that any elongation of the outside valve spindles was multiplied by the conjugated valve gear. Although this had been anticipated at the design stage, the overall consequence was that the inside cylinder had a tendency to give more power than the other two as speed increased, leading to the overloading of the inside connecting rod bearings, especially the big-end which was liable to overheat and fail. Various experiments were tried over the years to cure this chronic ailment, and it was only towards the end of the steam era that a real solution was found in Great Western methods of lubrication and manufacture for the big-end bearing. Other problems persisted, such as a stiff, insensitive regulator and overall design flaws that hampered maintenance.|$|E

5000|$|The {{engine of}} the VF1000R was the same cast block as in the VF1000F, {{displacing}} the same 998 cc's as the standard model, but modifications were required to mount the gear train in each head, used for driving the cams. The crankshaft was also altered, in order to accept a straight-cut gear which would drive the gear train instead of the chain system, used in the [...] "F" [...] model. Each head had 2 gears held by a carrier, which was then bolted into the respective head, driving {{each of the two}} camshafts arranged in a dual overhead camshaft arrangement for each head. Total, there were 9 gears required to transmit power from the crankshaft to all 4 camshafts. The camshafts were altered in relation to the ones found on the [...] "F" [...] model in order to provide more power.

50|$|Boosters may {{be driven}} by an {{electric}} motor, hydraulics, low or high pressure air or manually by a lever system. Those powered by compressed air are usually linear actuated systems, where a pneumatic cylinder directly drives the compression piston, often in a common housing, separated by a seal. A high pressure pneumatic <b>drive</b> <b>arrangement</b> may use the same pressure as the output pressure to drive the piston, and a low pressure drive will use a larger diameter piston to multiply the applied force.|$|E

In 1847, Crampton became a founder {{member of the}} Institution of Mechanical Engineers, and in 1848, Crampton set up in business as a Civil Engineer in London. In 1850, a Crampton locomotive was exhibited at Birmingham which had balance weights on the driving wheels. This feature was commented upon by William Stroudley. In 1851, Crampton started the Broadstairs Gasworks, overseeing the construction and financing much of the works.|$|E
50|$|Selection of the internal/external <b>drive</b> <b>arrangement</b> {{is often}} idiosyncratic. The service {{life of the}} {{high-pressure}} shaft seal {{can be difficult to}} predict, and it may safely be assumed that the seal will cost a good deal more than the motor itself. For instance, a 2 in, 150 psi seal for a 50 hp motor will cost $2,000, whereas the motor itself is half that much. Generally, the combination of vessel pressure, shaft diameter, and fan speed encountered in autoclaves is such as to make the use of a shaft seal reasonably practicable.|$|E

50|$|Fan drives can be {{internal}} or external. Internal drives have the motor inside the autoclave in an unheated chamber.

40|$|Current-regulated PWM voltage-source {{inverters}} {{with either}} sinusoidal or square-wave output {{are the most}} common power electronic converters used to feed PM motors. Square-wave fed permanent magnet motors yield a higher torque whereas the torque ripple of sine-wave fed brushless motors is significantly lower. An innovative topology of dc brushless motor with the stator phases being fed in series by means of a solid-state-commutator (SSC) is presented in this paper. The solid-state-commutator provides each motor phase with 180 ° square wave current timed with respective emf.

40|$|The {{handling}} behaviour {{of vehicles}} {{is an important}} property for its relation to performance and safety. In 1970 s, Pacejka did the groundwork for an objective analysis introducing the handling diagram and the understeer coefficient. In more recent years, the understeer concept is still mentioned but the handling is actively managed by direct yaw control (DYC). In this paper an accurate analysis of the vehicle handling is carried out, considering also the effect of drive forces. This analysis brings to a new formulation of the understeer coefficient, which is almost equivalent to the classical one, {{but it can be}} obtained by quasi-steady-state manoeuvres. In addition, it relates the vehicle yaw torque to the understeer coefficient, filling up the gap between the classical handling approach and DYC. A multibody model of a Formula SAE car is then used to perform quasi-steady-state simulations in order to verify the effectiveness of the new formulation. Some vehicle set-ups and wheel <b>drive</b> <b>arrangements</b> are simulated and the results are discussed. In particular, the handling behaviours of the rear wheel drive (RWD) and the front wheel drive (FWD) architectures are compared, finding an apparently surprising result: for the analysed vehicle the FWD is less understeering than for RWD. The relation between the yaw torque and the understeer coefficient allows to understand this behaviour and opens-up the possibility for different yaw control strategies...|$|R
