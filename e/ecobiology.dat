40|$|The sorghum shoot fly, Atherigona soccata {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pests of grain sorghum in Asia, Africa and the Mediterranean Europe. This paper reviews the current state of information on diversity, <b>ecobiology,</b> parasitism levels, and mass rearing of the parasitoids, predators and pathogens attacking different stages of Atherigona soccata. Among the parasitoids, Trichogramma chilonis and Trichogrammatoidea simmondsi on the eggs, and Neotrichoporoides nyemitawus on the larvae are most important. Although 15 species of predators have been recorded, their predation potential has not been assessed under field conditions. Several species of spiders are important predators on eggs. The <b>ecobiology</b> of Trichogramma chilonis, Trichogrammatoidea simmondsi, N. nyemitawus, Spalangia endius, and Trichopria sp. has been studied in considerable detail. The parasitism levels are quite high during the post-rainy season by Aprostocetus sp., N. nyemitawus, Opius sp. and S. endius. Augmenting populations of Trichogramma chilonis does not reduce the shoot fly infestation under field conditions. Parasitism by N. nyemitawus is greater in sorghum-cowpea intercrop than where sorghum is the sole crop. Mass rearing techniques are available only for Trichogramma chilonis and Trichogrammatoidea bactrae. The constraints and challenges for utilizing the natural enemies in integrated pest management have been discussed...|$|E
40|$|In {{the years}} 2002 - 2008, {{missions}} were {{undertaken in the}} USA and Canada to search for wild and weedy Lactuca species. Altogether, 16 states in the USA (Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming) and two provinces in Canada (Ontario and Quebec) were visited. In total, seven wild and weedy Lactuca spp. (L. serriola, L. saligna, L. virosa, L. canadensis, L. biennis, L. floridana, and L. ludoviciana), an interspecific hybrid (L. canadensis × L. ludoviciana), and an undetermined Lactuca species were observed and collected in 200 locations. In this paper, we present new data on the distribution and <b>ecobiology</b> of Lactuca naturally occurring in North America. Morphological assessment of L. serriola samples acquired from North America revealed considerable intraspecific phenotypic variation. Although L. serriola samples originating from various eco-geographical regions differed significantly in their genetic polymorphisms (based on AFLP markers), little variation was observed in their absolute DNA content...|$|E
40|$|In deep {{temperate}} lakes, thermobaricity (i. e. {{the decrease}} in the temperature of maximum density of fresh water with increasing depth) is the crucial physical property governing deep ventilation. If an external forcing {{is strong enough to}} mix and move the surface layers downward to a critical depth, thermobaric downwelling could be initiated and a portion of cold and oxygenated surface water freely sinks. The renewal of deep water determines significant effects on the <b>ecobiology</b> of the whole lake. Estimates of the sinking volume extension from the observations are often uncertain, suggesting that developing a modelling tool may be a challenging and worthwhile task. A simplified one-dimensional numerical model has been developed to analyze the deep downwelling mechanism. Given a profile of the vertical diffusivity, the numerical model solves the reaction-diffusion equation for temperature and any other generic tracer C (e. g. dissolved oxygen, passive tracers, biological tracers). The pressure is assumed as hydrostatic, and a non-linear equation of state is used, which takes into account the effects of both pressure and temperature on water density. The downwelling occurrences (volume, arriva...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{presents}} an interconnected approach for circumventing two inherent limitations associated with studies defining {{the natural history}} of influenza A viruses in wild birds. The first limiting factor is the ability to maintain a cold chain from specimen collection to the laboratory when study sites are in more remote locations. The second limiting factor is the ability to identify all influenza A virus HA subtypes present in an original sample. We report a novel method for molecular subtyping of avian influenza A virus hemagglutinin genes using degenerate primers designed to amplify all known hemagglutinin subtypes. It was shown previously that templates larger than 200  bp were not consistently amplifiable from ethanol-fixed cloacal swabs. For this study, new primer sets were designed within these constraints. This method was used to perform subtyping RT-PCR on 191 influenza RNA-positive ethanol-fixed cloacal swabs obtained from 880 wild ducks in central Alaska in 2005. Seven different co-circulating hemagglutinin subtypes were identified in this study set, including H 1, H 3, H 4, H 5, H 6, H 8, and H 12. In addition, 16 % of original cloacal samples showed evidence of mixed infection, with samples yielding from two-to-five different hemagglutinin subtypes. This study further demonstrates the complex <b>ecobiology</b> of avian influenza A viruses in wild birds...|$|E
40|$|The <b>ecobiology</b> of pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) infesting cotton (cv. NHH 44) was {{studied at}} {{fluctuating}} ambient temperatures {{and also on}} artificial diet. No significant differences were observed in life-cycle. However, the influence of declining temperature was evident in extending the life-cycle period. This was supplemented with an increse in the duration of life-cycle, vit, 38. 95, 42. 01 and 42. 68 days during Oct-Nov, Nov-Dec and Dec-Jan, respectively. The lawa passed through 5 stadia and showed geometric increase in {{the width of the}} head capsule at each moult. The moths fed with honey produced an average of 129 eggs as compared to 20. 6 eggs when raised on water alone. There was {{a significant increase in the}} pupal weight when reared on artificial diet than on cotton bolls for two consequent generations. Sex ratio of the moths reared on artificial diet was in consonance (60. 3 : 29. 7 and 53. 3 : 46. 7) with those reared on cotton bolls (50. 8 : 49. 2). The artificial diet proved to be suitable in rearing pink bollworm across two generations without affecting its fecundity. Among the different foods offered, significantly higher adult longevity was recorded on honey, followed by sugar syrup, fresh cotton flowers, water alone, and without food and wate...|$|E
40|$|Subterranean {{ecosystems}} {{are regarded as}} the most extensive biome on earth, comprising terrestrial and aquatic systems - the latter constituting freshwater, anchialine and marine systems. This system {{plays a key role}} in the distribution and storage of freshwater, once it contains 97 % of the world’s total liquid freshwater (Chapter 1), which has been progressively explored in quality and amount. Initial observation of the subterranean environment began with speleological studies by the recognition of a typical fauna adapted to live inside caves. The first studies to provide information about aquatic subterranean fauna commenced in Slovenia, with the description of the Proteus aguinus by Laurenti in 1768. After an initial faunal classification by the Danish zoologist Schiödte (1849), the Austrian naturalist Schiner (1854) established the most commonly used classification for cave fauna and a great portion of modern research dealing with ecobilogy of aquatic subterranean fauna has mostly evolved from the European biospeleology (Chapters 1 and 3). Studies in biospeleology have made a significant contribution to the progressive knowledge in aquatic subterranean ecology, especially in those circumstances where the access of the underground through smaller voids (e. g. crevicular spaces) is not possible. Accessibility to the underground environment is in fact a negative factor that has led a large number of studies consider about subterranean fauna initially being limited to caves. Spatial constraint was (and still is) a limiting factor in accessing a diverse range of subsurface habitats, although during the last decade, modern research has been using advance technology as a tool to overcome the physical barriers to subterranean research. For a long time the classification of subterranean aquatic organisms was an unclear subject, with the classification subterranean fauna mostly related to terrestrial cave fauna (troglofauna). The classification system dealing with aquatic subterranean groups (stygofauna) is more recent. A few nomenclature schemes have been proposed to describe these relationships, based on morphological, behavioural, and ecological adaptations of animals to the underground life and their level of relationship with groundwater (Chapter 4). The prefix “stygo” is suggested as the most descriptive to refer ecologically to a group of animals related to groundwater habitats. Groundwater related fauna (stygofauna) is comprised by groups of animals encompassing aquatic surface, intermediate and subterranean habitats. They represent diverse group of animals that have different interactive relationships with the groundwater habitat. Some may transact between surface water and groundwater systems, while others spend the whole life cycle in the subterranean voids (Gibert et al., 1994). This transition zone between surface streams and groundwater is recognized as a critically important boundary or ecotone, constituted by a habitat that contains a reservoir of invertebrate fauna biodiversity. It is therefore from the study of karst systems that most information on groundwater <b>ecobiology</b> is resourced, once the open structure of most karsts terrains promotes a number of caves, streams, crevices, sinkholes, and springs to allow human access. Karst systems are well fractured because of the relation between the rock mass and the action of meteoric water, as well as the dissolution rate of calcium carbonate rocks that high. The latter increases with time, producing a terrain with a great drainage potential (Chapter 2). Once porosity is high and the flow of percolating water is fast, it allows good vagility for subterranean fauna and nutrients, as well as penetration of contaminants. In subterranean karsts, much water saturates some areas inside rock spaces. The saturation in the rock in turn promotes large water pockets, known as aquifers. When these groundwater aquifers are found to be interconnecting with the adjacent ecosystems, they became active eco-hydrological components, due to their key participation in the surface-groundwater continuum. Groundwater has different degrees of importance, depending on the available sources of surface water. In many countries it supplies a significant proportion of urban and rural drinking water, industrial, and agricultural. Yet, groundwater systems are “hidden”, difficult in access and to study (Chapter 4, 5 and 7), consequently the recognition of the groundwater aquifer as a natural resource that needs to be protected is largely ignored. Moreover, studies in the <b>ecobiology</b> and distribution of stygobitic invertebrates (Chapter 5), and the need to identify a frame of methods for quality assessment and the suitability of groundwater invertebrates as bioindicative elements, has not been developed (Chapter 6). Finally, strong management and public education programs are required to emphasize the need for a better understanding of the nature of groundwater resources, their participation and complexity (Chapter 8), with the conceptualization of the groundwater aquifer integrity as an ecosystem still receiving little attention in South Africa.

40|$|More than 650 {{people from}} around 60 {{countries}} attended the 1 st International One Health Conference, held in Melbourne from 14 to 16 February 2011. Scientists, clinicians, government {{and community members}} {{from a range of}} disciplines came together to discuss the benefits of working together to promote a One Health approach to human, animal and environmental health. One Health embraces systems thinking and recognising the interdependence of people, animals and environment. The conference was hosted by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and was supported by international agencies, the Australian and Canadian governments, and industry. The Organising Committee recognised from the outset, the need to provide a forum not just for scientific presentation, but for open discussion and dialogue around the policy and political issues, as well as the science that drives the One Health agenda. The Committee was also cognizant of the need to embrace a definition of One Health that includes food security and food safety and included the social and economic pressures that shapes this area. The meeting was therefore organised under four themes with plenary sessions followed by breakout parallel sessions for each of these. The themes covered Disease Emergence, Environmental Drivers, Trade, Food Security and Food Safety, and Science Policy and Political Action. The plenary session commenced with one or two keynote presentations by world leaders on the topic being covered, followed by panel discussions involving six to eight experts and involving all participants at the congress. Each of the panel members spoke briefly on the topic covered by the keynote speaker and were asked to be as provocative as possible. The discussions that followed allowed debate and discussion on the keynote presentations and the panel members comments. This was followed by six to eight parallel breakout sessions involving in depth papers on the session’s topic. Throughout the conference at various times, sponsored sessions dealt with particular areas of science or policy providing a further framework not only to learn current science but for debate and discussion. A full copy of all abstracts is available on the web at [URL] In concluding the Congress recognised the interdependence of, and seeks to improve human, animal and environmental health; recognised that communication, collaboration and trust between human and animal health practitioners {{is at the heart of}} the One Health concept; agreed that a broad vision that includes other disciplines such as economics and social behaviour is essential to success. The Congress stressed the need to promote the ‘do-able’ such as improving surveillance and response for emerging infectious diseases whilst developing the broader approach. It identified a need to emphasise community participation and development of community capacity, and especially, an open transparent dialogue with both a ‘ground up’ and ‘top down’ approach that would lead to an improved understanding of our ecosystems, including molecular <b>ecobiology,</b> are an essential part of One Health. </p...|$|E
