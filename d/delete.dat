5|$|Ottman {{said the}} {{challenge}} on Valkyrie {{was to create}} tension from dialogue scenes, and he often reshaped scenes to do this: moments rather than whole scenes were cut from the film. Being historically accurate meant Ottman was more restricted in reorganizing scenes, but {{he was able to}} choose what lines and close-ups he could focus on. Ottman said the scene he was most saddened to <b>delete</b> was a scene where von Stauffenberg dances with his wife because he had been looking forward to scoring it.|$|E

5|$|By September 3, 2009, {{attorneys}} representing Mercury Radio Arts, Glenn Beck's media company, {{had requested}} that the domain registrar of Eiland-Hall's website <b>delete</b> the site. Beck's lawyers characterized the site's location as libelous. They demanded that the domain registrar revoke the WhoisGuard privacy-protection service for the website, and turn over contact information for the then-anonymous Eiland-Hall. The registrar, NameCheap, refused. On September 4, 2009, Beck's lawyers sent another letter to the domain registrar, repeating their requests and noting that they had read the website's contents and were therefore aware from statements posted to the site that its operator had been notified by the registrar.|$|E

5|$|Encrypting {{ransomware}} reappeared in September 2013 with a Trojan {{known as}} CryptoLocker, which generated a 2048-bit RSA key pair and uploaded {{in turn to}} a command-and-control server, and used to encrypt files using a whitelist of specific file extensions. The malware threatened to <b>delete</b> the private key if a payment of Bitcoin or a pre-paid cash voucher was not made within 3 days of the infection. Due to the extremely large key size it uses, analysts and those affected by the Trojan considered CryptoLocker extremely difficult to repair. Even after the deadline passed, the private key could still be obtained using an online tool, but the price would increase to 10 BTC—which cost approximately US$2300 as of November 2013.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, the astrologer and {{psychologist}} Michel Gauquelin {{stated that}} {{though he had}} failed to find evidence that supported indicators like zodiacal signs and planetary aspects in astrology, he did find positive correlations between the diurnal positions of some planets and success in professions that astrology traditionally associates with those planets. The best-known of Gauquelin's findings is based on the positions of Mars in the natal charts of successful athletes and became known as the Mars effect. A study conducted by seven French scientists attempted to replicate the claim, but found no statistical evidence. They attributed the effect to selective bias on Gauquelin's part, accusing him of attempting to persuade them to add or <b>delete</b> names from their study.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{planning}} {{continued for}} the construction of the route, as well as modifications to the existing roadway. The City of La Mesa began discussions regarding adding SR 125 from SR 94 to I-8 into the scenic highway system in 1968; the county Planning Commission continued pursuing these plans in 1970. SR 125 was lengthened by the Legislature to extend to the Mexican border in 1972. In 1973, then-governor Ronald Reagan vetoed a bill to <b>delete</b> part of SR 125 from state plans, over concerns that not enough transportation studies had been done on the matter. An improved interchange with SR94 was being planned the next year. Soon after, Caltrans raised concerns about the remainder of SR 125 not being constructed, due to objections from the community relating to freeway construction in general.|$|E

5|$|Picard pilots {{the shuttle}} {{through the field}} of {{distortion}} pockets. Chief Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) transports the Captain {{back to the ship}} before the shuttle is destroyed. The approach resulted in the Enterprise nearing the edge of the nebula, and they quickly depart. Afterwards, D'Sora reveals to Data over a romantic dinner in his quarters that she broke up with her boyfriend because he was emotionally unavailable and then pursued him because he was the same. Data realises that she is breaking up with him and explains that he will <b>delete</b> the subroutine. D'Sora departs and Data blows out the candles seemingly unperturbed.|$|E
5|$|SERN, an {{organization}} secretly researching time travel, learns {{of the time}} machine and sends people to the laboratory to retrieve it, killing Mayuri in the process. Okabe goes back in time multiple times to prevent Mayuri's death, but fails each time. He learns {{that he needs to}} undo all the changes their D-mails have caused, and does so until he realizes that undoing the first D-mail would return him to the timeline where Kurisu was found dead. Okabe and Kurisu tell each other about their romantic feelings for one another, after which Kurisu tells Okabe to save Mayuri. Daru hacks into SERN's database, and they <b>delete</b> the record of the D-mail, returning them to the original timeline.|$|E
5|$|Symantec {{announced}} a Professional Edition on November 19, 2002. Data recovery tools in this version allow users to recover deleted or malware-damaged files.

To maintain dial-up connections, Connection Keep Alive simulates online activity during periods of user inactivity. Norton Productivity Control enables users to filter Internet content and block newsgroups.

5|$|The iPad {{does not}} employ digital rights {{management}} (DRM), but the OS prevents users from copying or transferring certain content outside of Apple's platform without authorization, such as TV shows, movies, and apps. Also, the iPad's development model requires anyone creating an app for the iPad to sign a non-disclosure agreement and pay for a developer subscription. Critics argue Apple's centralized app approval process {{and control of the}} platform itself could stifle software innovation. Of particular concern to digital rights advocates is Apple's ability to remotely disable or <b>delete</b> apps on any iPad at any time.|$|E

They managed to book Room 1511 in the River View Hotel off Havelock Road. The next morning, Martin asked a hotel receptionist to <b>delete</b> Lowe's name from the room registration system, saying that he had kicked Lowe out the previous night for being a homosexual. Martin checked out on 11 March and flew to Bangkok the same day.|$|E
5|$|Andersen's {{auditors}} were {{pressured by}} Enron's management to defer recognizing the charges {{from the special}} purpose entities as its credit risks became known. Since the entities would never return a profit, accounting guidelines required that Enron should take a write-off, where {{the value of the}} entity was removed from the balance sheet at a loss. To pressure Andersen into meeting Enron's earnings expectations, Enron would occasionally allow accounting companies Ernst & Young or PricewaterhouseCoopers to complete accounting tasks to create the illusion of hiring a new company to replace Andersen. Although Andersen was equipped with internal controls to protect against conflicted incentives of local partners, it failed to prevent conflict of interest. In one case, Andersen's Houston office, which performed the Enron audit, was able to overrule any critical reviews of Enron's accounting decisions by Andersen's Chicago partner. In addition, after news of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigations of Enron were made public, Andersen would later shred several tons of relevant documents and <b>delete</b> nearly 30,000 e-mails and computer files, causing accusations of a cover-up.|$|E
