40|$|The {{application}} of turbulence instrumentation on underwater gliders is addressed, and two methods for glider-inferred <b>dissipation</b> <b>rates</b> of turbulent kinetic energy are evaluated against a ship-based vertical microstructure profiler. The well-established ship-based measurements {{are used as}} a reference for the analysis. A Slocum glider was deployed for one week in the Faroe Bank Channel, equipped with a MicroRider with turbulence sensors for velocity shear and temperature microstructure. <b>Dissipation</b> <b>rates</b> of turbulent kinetic energy are calculated from velocity shear by integrating the wavenumber spectrum after fitting it to the Nasmyth universal spectrum. Survey-averaged profiles from the glider's shear-derived <b>dissipation</b> <b>rates</b> have similar shape as that measured by the vertical microstructure profiler, but overestimate <b>dissipation</b> <b>rates</b> by up to a factor of 3 in the vicinity the turbulent interface, attributed to the glider's slanted path and inability to penetrate sufficiently undisturbed through the swift plume interface. Microstucture temperature profiles are used to calculate <b>dissipation</b> <b>rates,</b> which is done by fitting temperature gradient spectra to the universal Batchelor form using the maximum likelihood estimate. This method allows for automatic rejection criteria, which are applied to remove bad fits. Results compare reasonably well with the vertical microstructure profiler measurements, but are underestimated close to the bottom, which is a caveat of the Batchelor fit, consistent with a previous study. Overall, measurement of <b>dissipation</b> <b>rates</b> from gliders is a powerful addition to traditional shipborne turbulence profilers, as they {{make it possible to}} survey large areas by deploying several gliders.

40|$|The Mauritanian {{coastal area}} {{is one of}} the most biologically {{productive}} upwelling regions in the world ocean. Shipboard observations carried out during maximum upwelling season and short-term moored observations are used to investigate diapycnal mixing processes and to quantify diapycnal fluxes of nutrients. The observations indicate strong tide-topography interactions that are favored by near-critical angles occurring on large parts of the continental slope. Moored velocity observations reveal the existence of highly nonlinear internal waves and bores and levels of internal wave spectra are strongly elevated near the buoyancy frequency. <b>Dissipation</b> <b>rates</b> of turbulent kinetic energy at the slope and shelf determined from microstructure measurements in the upper 200 m averages to ? = 5 × 10 - 8 W kg- 1.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{estimating}} <b>dissipation</b> <b>rates</b> from a vertically pointing Doppler lidar with high temporal and spatial resolution has been evaluated by comparison with independent measurements derived from a balloon-borne sonic anemometer. This method utilizes the variance of the mean Doppler velocity {{from a number of}} sequential samples and requires an estimate of the horizontal wind speed. The noise contribution to the variance can be estimated from the observed signal-to-noise ratio and removed where appropriate. The relative size of the noise variance to the observed variance provides a measure of the confidence in the retrieval. Comparison with in situ <b>dissipation</b> <b>rates</b> derived from the balloon-borne sonic anemometer reveal that this particular Doppler lidar is capable of retrieving <b>dissipation</b> <b>rates</b> over a range of at least three orders of magnitude.

40|$|Observations of {{turbulence}} <b>dissipation</b> <b>rates</b> in {{the planetary}} boundary layer are crucial for validation of parameterizations in numerical weather prediction models. However, because <b>dissipation</b> <b>rates</b> are difficult to obtain, they are infrequently measured through {{the depth of the}} boundary layer. For this reason, demonstrating the ability of commonly used wind profiling radars (WPRs) to estimate this quantity would be greatly beneficial. During the XPIA field campaign at the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory, two WPRs operated in an optimized configuration, using high spectral resolution for increased accuracy of Doppler spectral width, specifically chosen to estimate turbulence from a vertically pointing beam. Multiple post-processing techniques, including different numbers of spectral averages and peak processing algorithms for calculating spectral moments, were evaluated to determine the most accurate procedures for estimating turbulence <b>dissipation</b> <b>rates</b> using the information contained in the Doppler spectral width, using sonic anemometers mounted on a 300  m tower for validation.

40|$|Since {{gravity waves}} {{significantly}} influence the atmosphere by transporting energy and momentum, {{it is important}} to study their wave spectrum and their energy <b>dissipation</b> <b>rates.</b> Besides that, knowledge about gravity wave sources and the propagation of the generated waves is essential. Originating in the lower atmosphere, gravity waves can move upwards; when the background wind field is equal to their phase speed a so-called critical layer is reached. Their breakdown and deposition of energy and momentum is possible. Another mechanism which can take place at critical layers is gravity wave reflection. In this paper gravity waves which were observed by foil chaff measurements during the DYANA campaign (DYnamics Adapted Network for the Atmosphere) in 1990 in Biscarrosse (44 °N, 1 °W) —as reported by Wüst and Bittner [2006. Non-linear wave-wave interaction: case studies based on rocket data and first application to satellite data.
