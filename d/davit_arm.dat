40|$|This report {{pertains}} to the mechanical design details of the Autoclave shell. The vessel is designed as per ASME Pressure vessel code. This is the largest autoclave shell built indigenously {{with the state of}} the art features. The <b>davit</b> <b>arm</b> door handling system with steering mechanism has been adopted for the door handling system. Lock ring less quick lock mechanism along with fool proof door lock safety device has been incorporated. The FEM analysis of the vessel for the hydro test case has also been carried out. The design and detailed fabrication drawings have been appraised by a third party inspection agency M/s Lloyds Register Asia. The entire manufacturing activity is also carried out under the supervision of M/s Lloyds...|$|E
40|$|Davit {{arms are}} usually {{employed}} to handle doors of large size autoclaves. These arms require a guiding mechanism {{to guide the}} door in a desired path and locate in the desired position. In this work, various options of door handling / steering mechanisms were examined and finally a four bar mechanism is chosen for detailed design. A Geometric model was developed to understand the path traced by the door for various link angles and lengths. Solid modeling of the door was carried out using Solidworks R and simulation of the path of the door for various angles and lengths of the links of the 4 bar mechanism was also done. The prototype model of the autoclave door was fabricated with a 4 bar mechanism mounted on the <b>davit</b> <b>arm</b> of the door. Number of trials were made by changing link lengths and angles to determine the path of the door, using the CAD geometric model. These results are in agreement with the experimental results obtained using fabricated model...|$|E
50|$|Boat deck {{carried the}} ship's six lifeboats, three on each side, {{including}} one motorized boat, the center {{boat on the}} port side. The ship was fitted with gravity roller track davits for the larger aft and center boats. The curved <b>davit</b> <b>arms</b> extended over the open portion of Promenade deck. Radial single pivot davits were implemented for the smaller forward boats.|$|R
