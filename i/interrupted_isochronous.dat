50|$|Each USB HID {{interface}} communicates {{with the}} host using either a control pipe or an <b>interrupt</b> pipe. <b>Isochronous</b> and bulk pipes {{are not used}} in HID class devices. Both IN and OUT control transfers are required for enumeration; only an IN interrupt transfer is required for HID reports. OUT interrupt transfers are optional in HID-class devices.|$|R
500|$|There are {{two types}} of pipe: stream and message. A message pipe is {{bi-directional}} and is used for control transfers. Message pipes are typically used for short, simple commands to the device, and a status response, used, for example, by the bus control pipe number 0. A stream pipe is a uni-directional pipe connected to a uni-directional endpoint that transfers data using an <b>isochronous,</b> <b>interrupt,</b> or bulk transfer: ...|$|R
