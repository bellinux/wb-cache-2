40|$|The {{material}} scenario {{provides the}} most illustrative of entry points into this collection of evidence embodying the difference between play and tolerance. In a material assemblage, the looseness in a joint (<b>expansion,</b> <b>pin,</b> etc.) allows the assemblage to respond to dynamic loads such as wind and heat. Without this play, the construction becomes brittle, unable to flex under the concrete conditions of its situation. The looseness in this sense is productive. Tolerance, in the manufacturing of components, begins with a diagram (engineering specifications) and the looseness in its production, {{the difference between the}} diagram and actual, is derogatory. This thesis uses play and tolerance as points of departure and return, organizing a collection of evidence that frames technology, aesthetics, social organizations, systems of control and analysis as a way to illustrate and dramatize the effects of these different attitudes towards looseness, attempting to find places for play in the city in hopes of identifying potential for an urbanity outside the paradigm of compliance. by Jeremy Voorhees.

Because the power and serial pins remained unchanged between the two slots, {{it was possible to}} design a universal modem card which could work in either.

Boundary scan features are used to allow controlling of the TAM and the P 1500 wrappers. The final architecture characteristics are its flexibility, scalability and reconfigurability. It also allows trade-off to optimize test time and area overhead. The second part deals with a test <b>pin</b> <b>expansion</b> method in order to solve the bandwidth problem.

40|$|The {{effective}} piezoelectric {{coefficients of}} twin walls in tetragonal ferroelectric are calculated {{in the framework}} of decoupling approximation and Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory allowing for polarization gradient terms, electrostriction and flexoelectric coupling. Using an example of piezoelectric response of a 1 -a 2 twins to a homogeneous electric field, we show that the response is almost independent on the flexoelectric coupling, but is very sensitive to the values of polarization gradient coefficients. This behavior originates from the strong coupling between local dielectric susceptibility and the gradient coefficients. The enhancement of piezoelectric response from 10 % up to a factor of 103 times is predicted. The local electromechanical response of the domain walls can thus provide information on the gradient terms in GLD <b>expansion</b> and <b>pinning</b> mechanisms of the ferroelectric domain walls. The observability of these effects by the piezoresponse force microscopy of electroded structures and impact on the functional properties of the systems with dense domain structures is analyzedComment: 20 pages, 4 figures, 5 appendices, to be submitted to J.

40|$|With {{the aid of}} a {{non-destructive}} replica {{method and}} computational protocol, surface geometry and expan-sion at the reproductive shoot apex are analysed for pin-formed 1 (pin 1) Arabidopsis thaliana and com-pared with the wild type. The observed complexity of geometry and <b>expansion</b> at the <b>pin</b> 1 apex indicates that both components of shoot apex growth, i. e. the meristem self-perpetuation and initiation of lateral organs, are realized by the pin 1 apex. The realization of the latter component, however, is only occasion-ally completed. The pin 1 apex is generally dome-shaped, but its curvature is not uniform, especially later during apex ontogeny, when bulges and saddle-shaped regions appear on its periphery. The only saddle-shaped regions at the wild-type shoot apex are creases separating ¯ower primordia from the meristem. Surface <b>expansion</b> at the <b>pin</b> 1 apex is faster than at the wild type. In both pin 1 and wild type the apex surface is differentiated into regions of various areal strain rates. In the pin 1 apex, but not in the wild type, these regions correspond to the geo-metrically distinguished central and peripheral zones. Expansion of the central zone of the pin 1 apex is nearly isotropic and slower than in the peripheral zone. The peripheral zone is differentiated into ring-shaped portions of different expansion anisotropy. The distal portion of this zone expands anisotropic-ally, similar to regions of the wild-type apex peri-phery, which contact older ¯ower primordia. The proximal portion expands nearly isotropically, like sites of ¯ower initiation in the wild type. The peri-pheral zone in pin 1 is surrounded by a `basal zone', a sui generis zone, where areal strain rates are low and expansion is anisotropic. The possible relation-ships between the observed regions of different expansion and the various gene expression patterns in the pin 1 apex known from the literature are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The thermoelastic {{analysis}} of a load bearing pin joint has an intricate aspect associated to it. The mixed boundary condition of partial contact and separation at the pin-plate interface, {{in the presence of}} heat flow and varying bearing load, can lead to mathematical difficulties such as non-existence of solutions and physical ambiguities such as non-uniqueness of contact configurations in certain load ranges. The {{analysis of}} these systems, where temperature field and contact areas are mutually interdependent, need special care in handling as the configuration achieved can become dependent on loading history. This aspect in relation to a two-dimensional model consisting of a rigid smooth misfit pin in a large isotropic elastic plate under combined pin bearing load and on-axis unidirectional heat flow is investigated, the key role being played by the thermal <b>expansion</b> of the <b>pin</b> and the step model for thermal conductance at partial pin-plate interfacial contact...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. As System on a Chip (SoC) testing faces new challenges, {{some new}} test {{architectures}} must be developed. This paper describes a Test Access Mechanism (TAM) named CAS-BUS that solves {{some of the}} new problems the test industry has to deal with. This TAM is scalable, flexible and dynamically reconfigurable. The CAS-BUS architecture is compatible with the IEEE P 1500 standard proposal in its current state of development, and is controlled by Boundary Scan features. This basic CAS-BUS architecture has been extended with two independent variants. The first extension has been designed in order to manage SoC made up with both wrapped cores and non wrapped cores with Boundray Scan features. The second deals with a test <b>pin</b> <b>expansion</b> method in order to solve the I/O bandwidth problem. The proposed solution is based on a new compression/decompression mechanism which provides significant results in case of non correlated test patterns processing. This solution avoids TAM performance degradation. These test architectures are based on the CAS-BUS TAM and allow trade-offs to optimize both test time and area overhead. A tool-box environment is provided, in order to automatically generate the needed component to build the chosen SoC test architecture...|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} the TSATT mission is {{dependent}} on a successful tether deployment: a flawless separation without tangling due to interference with the separation system. Separation system benchmarks have been researched to help guide our design and establish a foundation for the separation concept. The ideal heritage-flown separation system called the Lightband is not feasible to separate our two payloads due to the cost exceeding $ 110, 000 and possible tether snag issues. The goal for our ME 450 team is to prove that our laboratory can design, fabricate, and test a separation system that can be integrated for separating the two payloads during the TSATT mission. We have completed several analyses to refine our design to its final form. We evaluated the preload forces that the pinpullers can withstand, and used the data in our spring selection process. The springs had {{to comply with the}} geometric constraints of the design and impart the desired velocity, while also leaving a safety factor on the preload force. We also calculated the safety factor on each pinpuller under the 20 g launch loads to be 1. 89. Since it is less than 2. 0, it will need to undergo testing for flight qualification. Some first-order analysis was done on the thermal <b>expansion</b> of the <b>pins</b> in the bushings, and we determined that the change in dimensio...|$|R
