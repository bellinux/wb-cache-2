5|$|President Bush's legacy {{continues}} to develop today. Supporters credit Bush's counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from {{occurring in the}} US after 9/11 and also praise individual policies such as the Medicare prescription <b>drug</b> <b>benefit</b> and the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. Critics often point to {{his handling of the}} Iraq War, specifically the failure to find weapons of mass destruction, that were the main rationale behind the initial invasion—as well as his handling of tax policy, Hurricane Katrina, climate change and the 2008 financial crisis—as proof that George W. Bush was unfit to be president.|$|E

40|$|Michael J. Miller is Assistant Professor of Social and Administrative Sciences in Pharmacy (Pharmacy Practice) in the College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. He can be {{contacted}} at michael. miller@drake. eduKnowledge about prescription <b>drug</b> <b>benefits</b> is necessary for consumers to choose appropriate health benefits plans in a consumer-directed health plan market. The objective {{of this study was to}} describe employees' knowledge of their prescription <b>drug</b> <b>benefits.</b> A one-group, cross-sectional survey of full-time university employees with a tiered pharmacy benefit was performed. Correct responses to knowledge questions were described individually and as an aggregate index score. Respondent understanding of pharmacy benefits was low to moderate. Specifically, knowledge of pharmacy benefits was most limited with respect to formulary management, cost sharing, and financial implications of out-of-network use and the selection of a branded or generic medication. Future research should refine methods for assessing knowledge of pharmacy benefits, explore knowledge of pharmacy benefits in diverse samples, and assess the consequences associated with variations in knowledge of prescription <b>drug</b> <b>benefits.</b> Copyright 2005 by Medicom International.

The Alliance endorsed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2009, and protested against Rep.

25|$|In February 2012, Ontario passed {{legislation}} {{to allow the}} expansion of an already existing drug-tracking system for publicly funded drugs to include those that are privately insured. This database will function to identify and monitor patient’s attempts to seek prescriptions from multiple doctors or retrieve from multiple pharmacies. Other provinces have proposed similar legislation, while some, such as Nova Scotia, have legislation already in effect for monitoring prescription drug use. These changes have coincided with other changes in Ontario’s legislation to target the misuse of painkillers and high addiction rates to drugs such as oxycodone. As of February 29, 2012, Ontario {{passed legislation}} delisting oxycodone from the province’s public <b>drug</b> <b>benefit</b> program. This was a first for any province to delist a drug based on addictive properties. The new law prohibits prescriptions for OxyNeo except to certain patients under the Exceptional Access Program including palliative care and in other extenuating circumstances. Patients already prescribed oxycodone will receive coverage for an additional year for OxyNeo, and after that, it will be disallowed unless designated under the exceptional access program.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, I {{estimate}} {{a structural}} demand model for prescription <b>drug</b> <b>benefits</b> by Medicare beneficiaries {{using data from}} the Medicare HMO program. I then use the utility parameter estimates to explore other questions of interest relating to the elderly's demand for prescription <b>drug</b> <b>benefits.</b> In Chapter 1, I study the question of how much Medicare beneficiaries value prescription <b>drug</b> <b>benefits.</b> Using data from the Medicare HMO program, I find that Medicare beneficiaries are willing to pay $ 33 to increase their brand-name coverage limit by $ 100. I also estimate marginal cost for each HMO and regress it on prescription <b>drug</b> <b>benefits.</b> I find that raising brand-name coverage by $ 100 costs $ 30. These estimates suggest that Medicare HMO enrollees are less than average prescription drug users and the results give a lower bound for the welfare derived by the elderly from prescription <b>drug</b> <b>benefits.</b> Chapter 2 addresses the question of how Medicare HMOs' choices of premiums and benefits affect selection. Changes in demographic factors (a measure of risk based on beneficiaries' characteristics) and risk scores (a measure based on beneficiaries' inpatient diagnoses) in the fee-for-service sector are regressed on changes in premiums and benefits in the HMO sector. The results show that increasing premiums and lowering benefits raise the demographic factor but have no effect on the risk score, suggesting that beneficiaries in more expensive demographic categories switch out of HMOs when premiums rise and benefits fall but these beneficiaries are healthy for their demographic category. (cont.) Chapter 3 measures the welfare loss from the withdrawals from the HMO program following the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, using the utility parameter estimates from Chapter 1. The changes to the Medicare HMO program in the Balanced Budget Act triggered many plan withdrawals from the program. The welfare and costs are calculated under two counterfactual scenarios. The results show that the Medicare HMO program generates more welfare than costs and that the withdrawals resulted in a net loss for society. The estimates of the loss range from $ 4. 3 billion to $ 16. 6 billion. by Anne Elizabeth Hall. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Economics, 2005.

500|$|After being re-elected, Bush {{signed into}} law a Medicare <b>drug</b> <b>benefit</b> program that, {{according}} to Jan Crawford, resulted in [...] "the greatest expansion in America's welfare state in forty years;" [...] the bill's costs approached $7trillion. In 2007, Bush opposed and vetoed State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) legislation, which was added by the Democrats onto a war funding bill and passed by Congress. The SCHIP legislation would have significantly expanded federally funded health care benefits and plans to children of some low-income families from about sixmillion to tenmillion children. It was to be funded {{by an increase in}} the cigarette tax. Bush viewed the legislation as a move toward socialized health care, and asserted that the program could benefit families making as much as $83,000 per year who did not need the help.|$|E
500|$|Some {{commentators}} have criticized Ryan's votes {{for what they}} believe were deficit-increasing policies during the George W.

While he voted for the two Bush tax cuts (in 2001 and 2003), he also voted for the 2003 bill that created the Medicare Part D prescription <b>drug</b> <b>benefit,</b> the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), and the $700 billion bank bailout, and Ryan was one of 32 Republicans in the House {{to vote for the}} auto industry bailout. In 2011 President Barack Obama criticized Ryan as [...] "not [...] on the level" [...] by describing himself as a fiscal conservative while voting for these policies, as well as two [...] "unpaid for" [...] wars.

[...] The risk corridors succeeded in attracting ACA insurers. The program did not pay for itself as planned with [...] "accumulated losses" [...] up to $8.3 billion for 2014 and 2015 alone.
