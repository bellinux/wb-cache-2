In 1958, British mycologist R.W.G. Dennis collected the species in Venezuela during an expedition <b>financed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Percy Sladen Memorial Trust.

Other critiques of the consensus policy came from anti-Vietnam War activists, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the anti-nuclear movement.|$|E

However, the involvement of Bet Israel was deemed unacceptable by the Jewish Community of Zagreb, which is the sole owner of the Praška Street property, and which also sees itself as the sole legal representative of the Zagreb Jewish community. As a consequence, the community and its president, Ognjen Kraus, refused further participation in the project under the set conditions.|$|E

5|$|The current road {{further south}} was {{designed}} as a toll road by Thomas Telford to improve communications east of Glossop, which was expanding as an industrial town.

An act of parliament to build the road was passed in 1818, and construction was <b>financed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Duke of Norfolk and the Duke of Devonshire. The road opened in 1821, having cost £18,625 to build. Upon opening, it was the highest turnpike road in England. The road was immediately popular and increased toll collections of traffic heading to Glossop. Tolls were abolished on the road in June 1870.|$|E

40|$|The {{current system}} for {{financing}} cross-border students, {{based on the}} host country, is neither sustainable nor efficient: it produces too little cross-border education. On that background we explore two alternative solutions. The first one substitutes to <b>the</b> <b>financing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> host country, a <b>financing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> country of origin, through vouchers that the student may use at home or abroad provided {{it is in a}} recognized institution. The second one, potentially an efficient design, combines that substitution with a reimbursement of education costs through interjurisdictional transfers or the change of vouchers into contingent loans. At the end we also explore the case of differentiated tuition fees, a solution however inconsistent with present rules of the European Union. Classification JEL : I 22, I 23, H 77...|$|R
