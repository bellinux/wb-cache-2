Shipments of food from the mainland—which accounted for up to 90% of Hawaii's needs—had been curtailed as a coastwise strike had affected all ports except Los Angeles.

Together they established the Roswell 'n' Rayle Company, creating and voicing advertisements for companies. Because of her move to Denver, Roswell had to travel to Los Angeles twice a week to tape The Simpsons. This ultimately led to her requesting a pay raise in 1999; however, Fox refused to offer her the amount she wanted so she quit the show. Roswell returned to The Simpsons in 2002 after reaching a deal to record her lines from her Denver home.|$|E

Thompson was planning to be in Las Vegas for a friend's birthday on September 13, and initially insisted on traveling to Rome's Los Angeles studio on the 11th. However, this did not work for the show, which wanted him to travel {{on the day of the}} show. After a Rome staffer personally assured Thompson that he would be able to travel <b>from</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>to</b> Las Vegas immediately after the show, Thompson changed his travel plans. He felt the impact from the crash at his home near the Pentagon.|$|E
5|$|In May 1932, Kalep {{traveled}} from France to New York on the steamship SS Paris {{with the intention}} of flying back to Europe across the Atlantic Ocean; at the time, no woman had made a solo transatlantic flight. She befriended American aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart, who, unbeknownst to Kalep, was planning a similar feat. After Earhart's successful flight from Canada to Ireland on 20 May, Kalep decided {{that it would not be}} worthwhile to make her own attempt at flying across the Atlantic, since she would no longer be the first woman to do so. She continued to encourage other women to enter the field of aviation, however, and became a member of the Ninety-Nines, an international organisation for women pilots which was founded by Earhart and 98 other female aviators. In August 1932, Kalep planned to fly with Roger Q. Williams <b>from</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>to</b> Athens to celebrate the former city's hosting of the 1932 Summer Olympics, but their flight was canceled. Soon after, it was reported that Kalep had remarried to W. E. Hutton-Miller, an American stockbroker.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to heavy rain, high winds were reported. In Palm Springs, wind gusts {{were reported as}} high as 60mph (95km/h). As a result, several trees were felled and power outages occurred. Highway 86 and 111 were under water from Brawley, near the Mexican border to the Salton Sea. California State Route 98 was also flooded from Brawley to Blythe. Two of the four lanes on Interstate 15 were washed out <b>from</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>to</b> Las Vegas, stranding thousands of gamblers in places like Barstow. Ocotillo, a town that was devastated during Hurricane Kathleen in 1976, was flooded again. Buses were sent to evacuate the townspeople, but the residents declined to evacuate. Overall, damage totaled $25 million, mostly in agricultural losses in San Diego and Imperial Counties. Eight deaths were reported. Six children were swept away in the Los Angeles River. Five of them were rescued, but the sixth was later presumed dead.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} of Libby, played by Cynthia Watros, {{was introduced in}} this episode. Originally, Libby had been written {{to be in her}} late 40's or early 50's. Jennifer Jason Leigh was approached to play the part, but it went to Watros instead. When Watros auditioned for the part of Libby, she did not think that she would end up being cast. Once she was, Watros and her twin daughters immediately moved <b>from</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>to</b> Hawaii. Bernard is also introduced in this episode. As Rose is black, the producers thought the audience would expect Rose's husband to also be black, and made Bernard white to surprise the audience. They expected the audience to assume Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), the only black man in the tail-section survivors, was Bernard. L. Scott Caldwell, Rose's portrayer, was unaware of their plans and had been picturing her own husband, a tall black man, when playing the scenes. When she found out Bernard was white she was surprised, but not shocked.|$|E
5|$|According to Dekema, {{planning}} for I-805 began in 1956. The original routing for I-805 was approved as an Interstate Highway in July1958. It {{was added to}} the state highway system and the Freeway and Expressway System in 1959 as Route241. I-805 was expected to reduce traffic on what was then US101 between Los Angeles and San Diego, when the former was opened. Route241 was renumbered to Route805 in the 1964 state highway renumbering, and I-5 was designated along the route <b>from</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>to</b> San Diego. Further planning was underway in 1965, with the goal to have the route built by 1972, the federal highway funding deadline. This was to be the first freeway in the area with no prior road along its route that it would replace; the goal was to provide a bypass around San Diego for those traveling to Mexico, and improve access for local residents. By June, houses along the route in the North Park area were being sold, as the land was needed for the first stretch of the freeway to be constructed. The next year, Dekema confirmed that the first portion of what was known as the Inland Freeway to be built would be between Home and Adams avenues.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1970s, Ike Turner's {{excessive}} cocaine habit {{had gotten}} out of hand. During this period, Tina adopted the Nichiren Buddhism faith and chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo to help her deal with a stressful marriage and career. Due to Ike Turner's drug abuse, some shows were either canceled or postponed. In July 1976, Ike Turner had plans to leave United Artists Records for a five-year, $150,000 deal with Cream Records. The deal was to be signed on July 6. On July 1, 1976, Ike and Tina were en route <b>from</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>to</b> Dallas where the Revue had a gig at the Dallas Statler Hilton. Ike and Tina got into a fight during their ride to the hotel. Shortly after arriving to the hotel, Tina fled from the hotel and later hid at a friend's house. On July 27, Tina sued for divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences.Ike claims in his book that Tina initiated the fight by purposely irritating him so that she'd have a reason to break up with him before they were scheduled to sign a new 5-year contract upon their return from Dallas.|$|E
