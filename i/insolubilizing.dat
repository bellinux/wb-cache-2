30|$|The unmordated dyed silk showed {{color change}} rating of 4. This can be {{explained}} that the good fastness to washing for the sample dyed without mordant {{was due to the}} affinity of coloring component through H-bonding and van der Waals forces. Using mordants, the color change ratings were found to be within 3 / 4 to 5, where a rating of 5 (excellent) was found using tin-CT mordant. The ratings were found to be 4 / 5 in the case of using alum and alum-tin. So {{it can be said that}} the overall ratings of color change were good. As wash fastness is influenced by the rate of diffusion of dye molecules and state of dyes inside the fiber, dyes has a tendency to aggregate inside the fiber. Thus, their molecular size is increased resulting in good wash fastness. In addition, in the case of mordanted samples, complexing with mordant also has the effect of <b>insolubilizing</b> the dye, making it color fast.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{epithelium}} of rat {{small intestine}} was radioautographed {{to examine whether}} RNA is synthesized by the salvage pathway as shown after [3 H]uridine injection or by the de novo pathway as shown after [3 H]orotic acid injection. The two modes of RNA synthesis were thus investigated during the migration of columnar cells from crypt base to villus top, {{and the rate of}} synthesis was assessed by counting silver grains over the nucleolus and nucleoplasm at six levels along the duodenal epithelium-that is, in the base, mid, and top regions of the crypts and in the base, mid, and top regions of the villi.

40|$|Receptors {{for small}} {{endogenous}} hormones on human leukocytes were studied by <b>insolubilizing</b> the hormones and incubating {{them with the}} cells. Histamine, norepinephrine, and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) were conjugated to either of two types of carrier: (bovine or rabbit) serum albumin or a random copolymer of DL-alanine and L-tyrosine. The conjugates were linked to agarose beads (Sepharose) and the resultant drug-conjugate-beads were incubated with leukocytes. Norepinephrine (when linked to its carrier via glutaraldehyde) and histamine preparations bound the majority of leukocytes. The binding appeared to be specific for the hormones tested. For example, the binding by histamine-rabbit serum albumin-Sepharose was prevented or reversed by high concentrations of histamine and histamine antagonists, but not by catecholamines or their pharmacologic antagonists. Similarly, binding of cells to the norepinephrine conjugate was inhibited by some catecholamines and propranolol, but not by histamine or histamine antagonists. Conjugates of norepinephrine linked via carbodiimide did not bind cells. The protein or copolymer carriers did not contribute to binding per se. The hormone-protein-conjugates bound more cells than the hormone-polymer conjugates. The former (unlike the free amines) failed to stimulate accumulation of cyclic AMP in leukocytes. The norepinephrine linked to polymer via glutaraldehyde, however, did stimulate leukocyte cyclic AMP accumulation, possibly because of {{the flexibility of the}} polymer. Columns of the various Sepharoses were used to determine the distribution of receptors to each hormone in mixed leukocyte populations. The majority of cells appeared to have receptors for both histamine and norepinephrine (bound through glutaraldehyde). Receptors to prostaglandins may have been detected by the column procedure, but their distribution could not be quantitated. The approach described provides a means to separate leukocytes {{on the basis of what}} are likely to be preformed receptors to small endogenous hormones, and to study the physiologic importance and function of the receptors...|$|E

40|$|IgG {{isolated}} from the plasma of seven individuals hypersensitive to the common house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (DPT) was exhaustively adsorbed onto <b>insolubilized</b> DPT. The unbound fraction was found by radioimmunoassay to contain antibodies recognizing the variable region of both anti-DPT IgG and IgE antibodies. This recognition was idiotype (Id) -specific as it persisted after passage over <b>insolubilized</b> polyclonal IgG of unrelated specificity. Most of these anti-Id IgG carried the internal image of the initial antigen in that they competitively inhibited the binding of anti-DPT antibodies to DPT. Immunoadsorption of anti-Id IgG onto <b>insolubilized</b> anti-DPT IgG antibodies from the same individual completely eliminated their reaction with anti-DPT IgG but not with anti-DPT IgE, suggesting that idiotopes included in the antigen-binding site of specific IgG and IgE antibodies were not identical.

40|$|Spleen {{cells from}} mice immunized with sheep red cells were {{separated}} by differential adherence to <b>insolubilized</b> histamine, catecholamines, and prostaglandins. The hormones were <b>insolubilized</b> by linking them to Sepharose beads through a protein carrier. We measured hemolytic plaque formation (per million splenic leukocytes) of cells which passed through columns of hormone-carrier-Sepharose beads (i. e., those cells that failed to bind). As compared with control (no column) cells, the number of plaque-forming cells was substantially reduced by passage through histamine, epinephrine, isoproterenol, and prostaglandin-E 2 columns. Plaque-forming cells were not significantly reduced by passage through carrier Sepharose (another control) or norepinephrine- and prostaglandin-F 2 α-carrier Sepharose columns. Thus, the ability of an <b>insolubilized</b> hormone preparation to subtract plaque-forming cells roughly correlated {{with the presence of}} pharmacologic receptors for the corresponding free hormones, as judged by stimulation of cyclic AMP accumulation in the same cells, reported previously. Both 19 S and 7 S plaque-forming cells were subtracted by columns prepared from pharmacologically active hormones, but none of the <b>insolubilized</b> hormones stimulated accumulation of intracellular cyclic AMP.

40|$|Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is a polymer used in {{numerous}} applications, principally {{those in which}} its high water solubility is a desirable asset. However there are also areas where PVA is limited by its inherent solubility (for example some specific environments in the biomedical field). This work has sought to overcome such limits by manipulating the surface of PVA in order to propose various {{means by which the}} surface solvent resistance might be increased while maintaining the bulk properties of the polymer. Both chemical and physical modifications have been tried and in each case progress has been made towards <b>insolubilizing</b> a single surface of the polymer when in film form. Grafting various species onto the surface of PVA was successfully performed. It is believed that such species bonded to the PVA via attachment to the hydroxyl groups (though this has not been proven conclusively). The data contained herein has led {{to the conclusion that the}} primary factor in reducing solubility this way is the removal of the hydroxyl groups, and not the attachment of specifically highly hydrophobic molecules. Introducing permanent cross-links into the surface region has been attempted via various routes. The data recorded shows promise however the system is far from optimised. The biggest challenge remaining is to optimise the depth of material cross-linked. Some steps have been made towards understanding and controlling this parameter though there is much scope for further investigation. The methods used have built on those used for bulk cross-linking and as such are new for the case of surface specific treatment. An interesting phenomenon in some semi-crystalline polymers reported in recent years is that of surface specific crystallization. This effect has been successfully induced and observed in PVA to produce what is believed to be a highly crystalline surface layer, and crystalline regions of PVA are generally accepted to be more water resistant than amorphous ones. In summary, in this work several surface-specific treatments for PVA have been trialled, providing options for post-film forming modification to reduce the surface water sensitivity whilst retaining the bulk properties of the polymer. </p...|$|E

In radioautographs of duodenum prepared after [3 H] uridine injection, the count of silver grains was high over nucleolus and nucleoplasm in crypt base cells and gradually decreased at the upper levels up to the villus base. In the rest of the villus, the grain count over the nucleolus was negligible, while over the nucleoplasm it was low but significant. After [3 H]-orotic acid injection, the number of silver grains over the nucleolus was negligible at all levels, whereas over the nucleoplasm the number was low in crypt cells, but high in villus cells with a peak in mid villus. The interpretation is that, except for a small amount of label incorporated into DNA from either precursor by crypt cells, the bulk of the label is incorporated into RNA as follows. In the crypts, cells make almost exclusive use of uridine, that is, of the salvage pathway, for the synthesis of ribosomal RNA in the nucleolus and of messenger and transfer RNA in the nucleoplasm. However, when cells pass from crypt to villus, they mainly utilize orotic acid [...] i. e., the de novo pathway [...] for the synthesis of messenger and transfer RNA within the nucleoplasm...|$|E
40|$|Piezoelectric Quartz crystal {{has been}} used as {{transducer}} in biosensor research for years. Protein immobilization is the major concern of this quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) type of biosensor. In this research, different kind of physical and chemical protein immobilization methods were studied and compared with respect to their performance as well as the processes involved in the preparation. Among chemical methods, the use of 11 -mercaptoundecanol for gold electrode surface activation followed by carbodiimide condensation presents the bast responses when human serum albumin, HSA, used as insolubilized material for anti-HSA anti-HSA antibody detection. At anti-HSA concentration of 0. 5 mg/ml the change of frequency was 245 Hz which was better than when the short chain mercaptans were used as activation agents. Pyrrole based electro-induced polymerization was used for <b>insolubilizing</b> HSA on electrode surface. This novel immobilization approach in QCM study offers better sensitivities than the results from short chain mercaptans activation methods and is slightly inferior than the use of eleven-carbon mercaptan. The use of electro-induced polymerization to insolubilize protein on QCM electrode surface presents the advantages of simple, fast and easily scaled-up in its preparation which in turn favors the practical utilization of QCM in practical application. In this study, the feasibility of using both sides of the quartz crystal for anti-HSA determination was examined. The results showed the responses were almost double when a flow cell design was uptaken which diverted the flow to other side after the sample flowed thru the first side of the electrode. The results indicate that double-side flow cell design offers not only the increase of sensitivity but also the possibility of determining dual analystes in one sample flow. 壓電晶體生物感測器是一種以質量變化做為感測依據的檢測方法。製作壓電生物感測器時，最主要的是如何固定蛋白質於晶體表面上。本論文中，主要探討物理性吸附法、化學共價鍵結法及電聚合高分子法等各種蛋白質固定法，進一步探討壓電晶體生物感測器在免疫分析上之應用。其中化學共價鍵固定法中的C 11 /EDC/HSA是利用長鏈 11 -mercaptoundecanol作表面活化，再以 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide作架接固定HSA的結果較佳，在檢測Anti-HSA濃度 0. 5 mg/ml時頻率約為 245 Hz左右，不過其製作手續繁雜且時間需要較久。而電聚合pyrrole固定HSA的頻率變化約為 210 Hz左右，固定方法簡便又快速，應有實用於針對臨床診斷之潛力。 另外本論文亦開發晶片雙面之檢測，在使用物理性吸附固定法時，雙面檢測的頻率約可增加兩倍，在檢測Anti-HSA濃度 0. 5 mg/ml時頻率可降至 280 Hz。故未來除了可應用於增強頻率變化以提高靈敏度外，亦可發展同時檢測兩種不同被測物的檢測晶片上。摘要 I 英文摘要 II 目錄 III 表目錄 VI 圖目錄 VII 第一章、緒論 1 第二章、研究背景 3 2 - 1 、生物感測器 3 2 - 1 - 1 、生物感測器之原理 3 2 - 1 - 2 、生物感測器之組成 3 2 - 2 、壓電晶體生物感測器 8 2 - 2 - 1 、壓電晶體材料 9 2 - 2 - 2 、壓電晶體感測原理[林, 1998] 10 2 - 2 - 3 、壓電晶體生物感測器之應用 12 2 - 2 - 4 、壓電免疫感測器 13 2 - 3 、晶體電極表面蛋白質固定法 18 2 - 3 - 1 、物理性吸附法 18 2 - 3 - 2 、化學法 18 2 - 3 - 3 、包埋法 20 第三章、實驗 23 3 - 1 、實驗設備 23 3 - 1 - 1 、壓電感測裝置系統 23 3 - 1 - 2 、電鍍金之設備 23 3 - 1 - 3 、電鍍電聚合高分子之設備 23 3 - 1 - 4 、其他設備 24 3 - 2 、實驗藥品 27 3 - 3 、藥品配製 29 3 - 3 - 1 、鍍金液 29 3 - 3 - 2 、POD(PERIODATE-OXIDIZED DEXTRAN) 之製作 29 3 - 3 - 3 、PYRROLE之純化 30 3 - 3 - 4 、其他 30 3 - 4 、實驗步驟 32 3 - 4 - 1 、晶體電極之鍍金 32 3 - 4 - 2 、清潔電極 33 3 - 4 - 3 、物理性吸附固定法 33 3 - 4 - 4 、化學共價鍵固定法 33 3 - 4 - 5 、包埋法 44 3 - 4 - 6 、晶片之量測 45 3 - 4 - 7 、晶片雙面檢測(使用物理性吸附) 46 第四章、結果與討論 47 4 - 1 、物理性吸附固定法 47 4 - 1 - 1 、重覆使用性及濃度與頻率變化關係 47 4 - 1 - 2 、物理性固定法吸附現象之探討 47 4 - 2 、化學共價鍵固定法 56 4 - 2 - 1 、再生緩衝液之選擇 56 4 - 2 - 2 、以CYSTAMINE與CYSTEAMINE做表面修飾之探討 56 4 - 2 - 3 、自身聚集單分子膜(SAM) 之鏈長比較 64 4 - 2 - 4 、物理性吸附及短鏈分子固定法之比較 67 4 - 3 、電聚合高分子固定法之探討 69 4 - 3 - 1 、以掃環伏的方式電聚合固定HSA 69 4 - 3 - 2 、以定電壓的方式電聚合固定HSA 70 4 - 4 、雙面檢測結果及討論 75 第五章、結論 78 第六章、未來展望 81 參考文獻 8...|$|E

40|$|Intestinal {{solubility}} and permeability are importantbiopharmaceutical parameters determining {{absorption of}} systemically actingdrugs. When a drug {{is characterized by}} low solubility and/or low permeability, oralbioavailability can be seriously impaired. To improve the efficiency of theselection of drug candidates, solubility and permeability are screened for inan early phase of the drug discovery and development process. Up to date,however, plain aqueous buffer systems are often being used during these screeningprocedures. These buffers are far from physiologically relevant and one mayquestion the relevance of this approach. In recentyears, {{a lot of attention}} has been paid to the effect of intraluminalconditions (e. g. pH and bile secretions) on intestinal absorption. This has resultedin the definition of media simulating the fasted and fed state upper gastrointestinaltract (fasted state simulated intestinal fluid, FaSSIF, and fed state simulatedintestinal fluid, FeSSIF, respectively). Although these biorelevant media wereproposed on the basis of intraluminal composition and characteristics (pH, bilesecretion, osmolality, buffer capacity), lipolytic products present after foodintake (digestion of food derived lipids) were not incorporated into thesemedia. Furthermore, although these media may be used in in vitro model systems (especially to determine solubility anddissolution), they have not yet found their way into high throughput screeningmodels. Practicalities along with low-cost efficiency and the absence of firm in vitro-in vivo correlations have delayed their routine integration intodrug discovery. This research work focused on the characterization of human duodenalfluids and the development of alternative media which can more easily beincorporated into screening procedures estimating the intraluminal solubilityof drug candidates during drug discovery and early drug develoment. To attainthis goal, 3 different study approaches were set up. In a first study, humanintestinal fluids (HIF) were characterized on a time-after-food basis in 3 nutritional states (fasted, fed and fat-enriched fed state). A second studyevaluated the solubilizing capacity of these HIF for 5 poorly water solublemodel drugs and compared it to the solubility of these drugs in existingsimulated intestinal fluids (SIF). The third study explored d-&# 945;-tocopherylpolyethyleneglycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) containing media as alternative solventsystems for intraluminal solubility estimation; 17 model drugs were selectedand HIF were used as reference. Evaluation was based on the concept offunctional biorelevance meaning that HIF and SIF should have comparablesolubilizing capacity rather than an identical match of composition (compositionalbiorelevance). In thefirst study, a thorough characterization of fasted and fed (standard fed andfat-enriched fed) HIF was accomplished. Composition and characteristics of HIFwere determined with respect to pH, bile salts, phospholipids, lipolyticproducts (tri-, di-, monoglycerides and free fatty acids), surface tension andosmolality. For all of these intraluminal parameters, a substantial inter- andintra-subject variability was observed. Although variability might be avaluable source of information for the scientist (depending on the objective ofthe study), in our study, it also led to several consequences. Partly due to thehigh variability, it was not evident to distinguish trends based on individualtime-based evolution of the intraluminal parameters. Therefore, average profilesmight give more insight; for instance, for total lipolytic products, on thebasis of the median profile, after reaching a maximum 30 minutespostprandially, a gradual decrease was seen until a steady-state was noticed 120 minutes after food intake. The minimal differences between fasted, fed andfat-enriched fed state HIF can be seen as another consequence of the highvariability. In general, and based on average concentration profiles, a fedintraluminal state corresponds to higher concentrations of bile salts,phospholipids, total lipolytic products, osmolality and surface tension, and toa (slightly) lower pH as compared to the fasted state. Considering the biggerintestinal volume in the fed and fat-enriched fed state, absolute amounts werehigher in the fed state (standard fed and fat-enriched fed state) as comparedto the fasted state. The concentration-time-profiles of the intraluminalparameters were not substantially different in the fed as compared to thefat-enriched fed state. The second study explored the solubilizing capacity of HIF and SIFfor 5 poorly water soluble drugs (danazol, diazepam, indomethacin, ketoconazoleand nifedipine) representing acidic, basic and neutral drugs. For this study,HIF described in study 1 were used as solvent systems; solubility of the drugsin SIF was assessed in FaSSIF and FeSSIF, in FeSSIF version 2 (FeSSIF v 2), andin early, middle and late FeSSIF. The composition of these new versions ofFeSSIF was altered compared to the original FeSSIF in order to implement theeffect of lipolytic products and to concede to the dynamic intraluminalenvironment, especially after food intake. In correspondence with the aforementionedstudy on the composition of HIF, a high inter- and intra-subject variabilitywas seen for the solubilizing capacity of HIF. As concentrations and notabsolute amounts of biorelevant components affect solubilizing capacity, thesame implications as for study 1 are relevant here. First, based on individualprofiles, time-dependent trends are not clear. Second, differences between the 3 nutritional states were not very straightforward. Only for the earlypostprandial phase (30 to 60 minutes after food intake), a difference <b>insolubilizing</b> capacity between the standard fed state and the fat-enriched fedstate, and between a fed and the fasted state, respectively, was found. Examinationof the effect of intraluminal parameters on solubility of the 5 model drugs,showed a clear correlation between solubility of indomethacin and pH. For theother drugs, a combination of parameters determined the solubility in HIF. Whenthe solubilizing capacity of HIF and SIF was compared, in general FaSSIF andFeSSIF underestimated the solubility of the model drugs in HIF; especially theearly postprandial phase was underestimated by FeSSIF. The second generationFeSSIF, FeSSIF v 2, did not result in much improvement. On the contrary, earlyFeSSIF overestimated the solubility obtained in the first 90 minutes after foodintake. These 2 studies documented that pooling of HIF fractions, on subject or on time basis,may potentially lead to loss of valuable information. Nevertheless, dependingon the goal, pooling may be the most interesting approach, for example tovalidate in-vitro set-ups. The thirdstudy explored whether TPGS containing media may be used to estimate intraluminalsolubility. The solubilizing capacity of phosphate buffer containing differentpercentages of TPGS was examined for 17 model drugs with differentphysicochemical characteristics and was compared to the solubilizing capacityof early postprandial HIF, and SIF. Although direct measurement of theintraluminal solubility by solubility in FaSSIF and FeSSIF demonstrated anunderestimation, the predictive power of FaSSIF and FeSSIF was quite goodtaking into account the obtained relationship between solubility in FaSSIF andFeSSIF as compared to the experimental solubility in HIF. Based on the sameapproach, a similar predictive power could be accomplished by 0. 1 % and 2 % TPGSfor the fasted and the fed state, respectively. Bearing in mind the simplicity,lower cost and stability of these TPGS containing media, 0. 1 % and 2 % TPGS mightbe useful media for the estimation of intraluminal solubility of drugcandidates. In conclusion, we have demonstrated substantial inter- and intra-subjectvariability in time-dependent composition and solubilizing capacity of HIFwhich may have an impact on intestinal drug absorption and might be an one ofthe underlying reasons for the variable drug plasma-time profiles oftenobserved. The solubilizing capacity of HIF may satisfactorily be simulated byFaSSIF and FeSSIF. A comparable predictive power is attained by 0. 1 % and 2 %TPGS in buffer on condition that solubilities are corrected by implementing therelationship between the solubility in SIF and the experimental solubility inHIF. TPGS containing media may be instrumental for high throughput screeningmodels in drug discovery and early drug development. status: publishe...|$|E

Antibody specificity was confirmed by the capacity to recognize soluble and <b>insolubilized</b> FVIII and to neutralize FVIII cofactor activity in FX activation. Epitope mapping was carried out using a competition ELISA in which affinity-purified human antibodies inhibited the binding of labeled monoclonal antibodies. In most cases, a single region of the A 3 domain of the FVIII light chain was recognized by the antibodies, while the reactivity toward heavy chain epitopes differed from one antibody preparation to the other. Sera or IgG fractions of the serum before immunoadsorption over <b>insolubilized</b> FVIII did not bind to FVIII. The IgG fraction that was not retained on the FVIII immunosorbent contained IgG that bound to the variable part of anti-FVIII mouse monoclonal antibodies and inhibited the binding of labeled FVIII; in addition, the IgG fraction inhibited the binding of affinity-purified human antibodies to FVIII, thereby strongly suggesting the presence of anti-idiotypic antibodies. These findings indicate that the presence of anti-FVIII antibodies is a more universal phenomenon than previously thought and that anti-idiotypic antibodies capable of inhibiting the binding of anti-FVIII antibodies to FVIII are produced spontaneously. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Soluble auxin-binding {{proteins}} (ABPs) were purified to constant {{specific activity}} from bean and pea leaves by a procedure involving (NH 4) 2 SO 4 fractionation, anion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. Pea and bean ABPs exactly co-purify with ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBPCase) {{in a variety}} of chromatographic separation procedures. The subunit compositions, electrophoretic purities and indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) -binding stoichiometries of the purified ABPs provide further evidence for the identity of RuBPCase and ABP. Pea ABP and bean ABP have dissociation constants for IAA of 0. 8 and 1. 3 micromolar, respectively, as determined by an (NH 4) 2 SO 4 precipitation assay for IAA-binding to <b>insolubilized</b> ABP. IAA can bind to soluble bean and pea ABP (RuBPCase) as determined by equilibrium dialysis with affinities and stoichiometries similar to those determined for <b>insolubilized</b> ABP...|$|R

40|$|Extracts from {{embryonic}} and uterine {{tissue of}} mice, operationally defined as colony stimulating factor (CSF), promoted {{the growth of}} macrophage-granulocyte colonies in vitro. Uterine CSF focusses from pH 5. 15 to 6. 00 and embryonic CSF from pH 3. 60 to 5. 20, although both forms have similar biological activity. CSF is relatively resistant to denaturation but it is inactivated by periodate and dithiothreitol. Gel filtration indicates a molecular weight of 45, 000 which is unchanged following treatment with <b>insolubilized</b> trypsin, a procedure which affords a useful purification (240 -fold). Trypsin-sensitive material in CSF preparations modifies colonial form under certain conditions of culture, probably by increasing the motility of macrophages. Diaminoethane derivatives of CSF were prepared and retained biological activity at isoelectric points above pH 9. 0. These derivatives may be covalently linked to Sepharose providing an <b>insolubilized</b> form of CSF to study interactions of CSF with the cell surface...|$|R

30|$|Microvesicles were {{isolated}} after successive centrifugations as previously described [22]. Total microvesicles were assessed after capture onto biotinylated annexin- 5 <b>insolubilized</b> on covalently coated streptavidin multi-well plates (Roche, Paris, France). Microvesicle samples (100  μl/well) were incubated for 30  min at 37  °C. After three washes, {{the amount of}} <b>insolubilized</b> MVs was measured by prothrombinase assay in standardized medium containing human coagulation factors (1.2  μM FII, 33.3  pM FVa, 11.2  pM FXa, 2.2  mM CaCl 2). Variations of absorbance of pNAPEP 0216, a thrombin chromogenic substrate (1.52  mM final concentration, Cryopep, Montpellier, France), were detected in kinetic mode using a thermostated spectrophotometer set at 405  nm (VersaMax Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The absorbance values were converted into nanomolar phosphatidylserine equivalent (PhtdSer eq.) by reference to a calibration curve using synthetic vesicles (33 % w/w PhtdSer and 67 % w/w PhtdChol). In the prothrombinase assay, PhtdSer exposed by MVs is the rate-limiting factor of the reaction leading to thrombin generation [26].|$|R
