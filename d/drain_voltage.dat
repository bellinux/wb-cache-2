25|$|Lower {{transconductance}}: The transconductance of the MOSFET decides its {{gain and}} {{is proportional to}} hole or electron mobility (depending on device type), at least for low drain voltages. As MOSFET size is reduced, the fields in the channel increase and the dopant impurity levels increase. Both changes reduce the carrier mobility, and hence the transconductance. As channel lengths are reduced without proportional reduction in <b>drain</b> <b>voltage,</b> raising the electric field in the channel, the result is velocity saturation of the carriers, limiting the current and the transconductance.|$|E
25|$|Lower output resistance: For analog operation, good gain {{requires}} a high MOSFET output impedance, {{which is to}} say, the MOSFET current should vary only slightly with the applied drain-to-source voltage.

If drain-to-source voltage is increased further, the pinch-off point of the channel begins to move away from the drain towards the source. The FET is said to be in saturation mode; although some authors refer to it as active mode, for a better analogy with bipolar transistor operating regions. The saturation mode, or the region between ohmic and saturation, is used when amplification is needed.
