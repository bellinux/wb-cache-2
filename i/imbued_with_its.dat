That {{was the first thing}} that struck him, an abject, miserable fool, and he repeated it to himself a dozen times in a rush of angry feeling. He despised himself. How could he have got into such a mess? But at the same time, for his thoughts chased one another through his brain and yet seemed to stand together, in a hopeless confusion, like the pieces of a jig-saw puzzle seen in a nightmare, he asked himself {{what he was going to}} do. Everything was so clear before him, all he had aimed at so long within reach at last, and now his inconceivable stupidity had erected this new obstacle. Philip had never been able to surmount what he acknowledged was a defect in his resolute desire for a well ordered life, and that was his passion for living in the future; and no sooner was he settled in his work at the hospital than he had busied himself with arrangements for his travels. In the past he had often tried not to think too circumstantially of his plans for the future, it was only discouraging; but now that his goal was so near he saw no harm in giving away to a longing that was so difficult to resist. First of all he meant to go to Spain. That was the land of his heart; and by now he was <b>imbued</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> spirit, its romance and colour and history and grandeur; he felt that it had a message for him in particular which no other country could give. He knew the fine old cities already as though he had trodden their tortuous streets from childhood. Cordova, Seville, Toledo, Leon, Tarragona, Burgos. The great painters of Spain were the painters of his soul, and his pulse beat quickly as he pictured his ecstasy on standing face to face with those works which were more significant than any others to his own tortured, restless heart. He had read the great poets, more characteristic of their race than the poets of other lands; for they seemed to have drawn their inspiration not at all from the general currents of the world's literature but directly from the torrid, scented plains and the bleak mountains of their country. A few short months now, and he would hear with his own ears all around him the language which seemed most apt for grandeur of soul and passion. His fine taste had given him an inkling that Andalusia was too soft and sensuous, a little vulgar even, to satisfy his ardour; and his imagination dwelt more willingly among the wind-swept distances of Castile and the rugged magnificence of Aragon and Leon. He did not know quite what those unknown contacts would give him, but he felt that he would gather from them a strength and a purpose which would make him more capable of affronting and comprehending the manifold wonders of places more distant and more strange.|$|E

Throughout, the book captures the excitement and sex appeal of glamour while exposing its mechanisms and exploring its sleazy and sometimes tragic underside.

Integrating fashion theory, film analysis, and literature, the insightful text investigates the ways cinema influences fashion and, conversely, how fashion speaks to film.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} discourses {{produced by the}} selected newspaper coverage of the Montréal Canadiens and Québec Nordiques, two professional hockey clubs based {{in the province of}} Québec, from 1979 to 1984. Sport has long provided a medium for national identification, and constitutes one the most effective institutions through which the nation is imagined. This is especially true of Canada, where ice hockey has been celebrated as the country’s national game and a window into the Canadian soul. However, sport is a malleable institution; in Québec, hockey has long served as a symbol, speaking to French Canadian national identity, <b>imbued</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> own significance independent of any pan-Canadian context. The Montréal Canadiens, founded in 1909, were the sporting institution most intimately associated with French Canadian identity. However, following two decades of unprecedented social, political, and economic changes in Québec, newspaper journalists in the early 1980 s questioned the Canadiens’ monopoly over Québécois affections. As a result, the newspaper coverage of the rivalry between the Canadiens and the newly-formed Nordiques was anchored in Québec’s neo-nationalist politics, and the teams became channels for debates about language, social change, the shape of Québec society, and the nature of Québec identity. Through a critical discourse analysis of the newspaper coverage of the Canadiens and Nordiques in both French and English newspapers, I determined that the Nordiques were celebrated as an institution that both reflected and advanced the neo-nationalist project, while the Canadiens were depicted as having fallen {{out of step with the}} pace of Québec’s social and political change. The neo-nationalist identity constructed through this newspaper coverage normalized the French language as the foundation of Québécois identity, but, contrary to the claims of neo-nationalists themselves, also constructed ethnicity and biology as central to the neo-nationalist sense of self. The identity represented through this hockey coverage excluded and even demonized Québec residents, such as Anglophones, who deviated from these norms. These discourses exposed the deep schisms that existed in Québec society in the early 1980 s...|$|E
40|$|Do legal {{frameworks}} direct merger outcomes? A {{study of}} the legal origins and consequences of recent higher education mergers V Soobrayan* University of Pretoria This article traces the legal challenges and contestations embedded in five recent cases of higher education mergers in South Africa. I am aware {{that there are a}} number of forms of mergers. For the purposes of this article I use the term as one that is descriptive of a policy decision. Where necessary I make a brief distinc-tion between a merger and incorporation. The article argues that although such mergers are founded in constitutional and legal imperatives, the process of merger is <b>imbued</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> own complexities and contests that influence the forms and outcomes of each merger. Legal frameworks and guiding principles are almost always up for dispute when mergers are con-templated, and such disputes can extend the time frames and alter the projected outcomes of a merger significantly. Legal frameworks include the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act (No 108 of 1996) and legislation and agreements relating to the merger process. These would include agreements between the merging institutions and collective bargaining agree-ments. In the two cases where the disputes have prolonged and, in one case, prevented the merger process from being completed, the stakes are high; there are long-term institutional and political relationships that could be decided at this conjuncture. What emerges in the analysis of these processes and outcomes is that in the context of higher education mergers legal frame-works are inadequate as an instrument to support the merger. Further, the feasibility of legal challenges and the wherewithal to declare them are closely aligned with the conception, distribu-tion and extent of political and institutional power. Exercising the right to issue a legal challenge is therefore rarely a purely legal matter. The capacity or failure to take legal action is closely intertwined with the power and authority of institutions to contemplate such action in the first place.

This work examines a series of mining-related dream narratives {{as a means of}} gauging how a community of New Guinean artisanal and small-scale gold miners understands the nature of minerals and their place in the cosmos, and how this cosmological outlook informs the ways they operate qua resource extractors. Through a "structural-metaphorical" analysis of the symbolic themes and ethnographic context of Hamtai-Anga "gold dreaming, " my thesis demonstrates that the miners of Kaindi conceptualise resource extraction in terms of a set of collaborative, procreative, and nurturing relations of "marriage" and of "affinity" between themselves, their spirit familiars, and the masalai (or guardian spirits) of the mines. According to this complex "holography of meaning", the miners are able to "generate”, “exercise, " and "make apparent" their extractive efficacy through a relational and elicitive engagement with their gendered "other"- or, in other words, by means of their capacity to make their female spirit familiars "fall in love" with them, "procreate" minerals like women procreate children, procure gold as wives provide garden food, and link them to the spirits of the mines as women link men to their in-laws. In order to secure and maintain their elicitive power, however, the miners must "enact" this metaphor by "behaving like" "good husbands" and "good affines" towards their familiars and the spirits of the mines.

Further, the feasibility of legal challenges and the wherewithal to declare them are closely aligned with the conception, distribu- tion and extent of political and institutional power. Exercising the right to issue a legal challenge is therefore rarely a purely legal matter. The capacity or failure to take legal action is closely intertwined with the power and authority of institutions to contemplate such action in the first place. The five merger cases from which this article is drawn are the voluntary merger between the ML Sultan Technical College (MLS) and the Technikon Natal (TN); the merger of the veterinary science faculties of the University of Pretoria (UP) and the Medical University of South Africa (Medunsa); the merger of the Johannesburg College of Education (JCE) and the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits); the merger of the Giyani College of Education (GCE) and the University of Venda (Univen) and the South African College for Teacher Education (Sacte) and the University of South Africa (Unisa). I draw on material presented in the five case studies published in a book on higher education mergers. Permission to use the material has been obtained from the authors, apart from myself, as contributors to this monograph entitled, Jansen J et al (2002). Mergers in higher education: lessons learned in transitional con- texts. While the article will offer some description of each of the five cases, my central focus will be to illustrate the legal issues that emerged (or did not emerge) in each and offer some analysis of the consequences of such legalities on the merger process...|$|E

It proposes that there is an affinity of the human voice to the architectural void that shapes how we sense our body and inhabit architectural space. The human voice can only be heard and understood because the resonant cavities of the mouth and skull reinforce and shape the vocal air stream from our lungs, <b>imbuing</b> it <b>with</b> <b>its</b> own unique vocal quality. In a similar manner each architectural space that we inhabit or congregate within for devotional or secular purposes acoustically alters the sound of our voice and shapes both our individual and collective sense of self. My research includes a case study of the Gregorian plainchant "Viderunt omnes," exploring the practice and evolution of monophony and polyphony in the context of architectural space, as well as interviews with musicians and vocalists regarding their perceptions of vocalizing in architectural space. This thesis then proposes a new "Oratory" to be located in downtown Seattle; a cultural center that promotes the human voice as an instrument and provides facilities for vocalists to sing and chant in a diverse range of acoustical spaces...|$|R
