500|$|It {{is a great}} {{outlet for}} me to go into the studio and write a song like 'Petals', which is one of my most {{personal}} songs and remains one of my favorites.

The song chronicles a lot of past emotions I've felt to certain people close to me, and the way I feel towards them and how their actions have impacted me personally.

500|$|As Morrison began live {{performances}} of the 40-year-old album Astral Weeks in 2008, there were comparisons to his youthful voice of 1968. His early voice was described as [...] "flinty and tender, beseeching and plaintive". Forty years later, the difference in his vocal range and power were noticeable but reviewers and critic's comments were favourable: [...] "Morrison's voice has expanded to fill his frame; a deeper, louder roar than the blue-eyed soul voice of his youth – softer on the diction – but none the less impressively powerful." [...] Morrison also commented on the changes in his approach to singing: [...] "The approach now is to sing from lower down [...] so I do not ruin my voice. Before, <b>I</b> <b>sang</b> in the upper area of my throat, which tends to wreck the vocal cords over time. Singing from lower in the belly allows my resonance to carry far. I can stand four feet from a mic and be heard quite resonantly." ...|$|E
500|$|Tim Ferguson met Richard Fidler busking on {{the streets}} of Canberra in 1984, while they were both {{attending}} university. Ferguson recalls: [...] "Richard was playing the guitar—something from Cat Stevens—one day and I walked up to him and we did 'Wild Thing'. <b>I</b> <b>sang</b> a few lyrics and jumped about like a mad thing. Lo and behold we made a stack of money in ten minutes." [...] The two began performing together and joined with another friend, Robert Piper, to form the Doug Anthony All Stars. They derived their name from Doug Anthony, a former Country Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. According to Fidler, during their earlier gigs in clubs and as street performers, Ferguson was [...] "a bit of an explosive hippie" [...] while Fidler and Piper were more reserved. Robert Piper left the group in 1985 due to other commitments. Piper has gone on to a successful career with the United Nations and in March 2013 was named Deputy Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process and the humanitarian coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory.|$|E

500|$|Jasmine's {{singing voice}} is {{provided}} by Filipina singer and actress Lea Salonga. Salonga's Tony Award-winning performance in the musical Miss Saigon helped her garner the interest of casting director Albert Tavares, who proceeded to leave a note for the singer on the stage door before leaving a show he had attended. Salonga's agent then scheduled her audition, at which she performed [...] "Part of Your World" [...] from The Little Mermaid. Salonga finally began recording a demo of [...] "A Whole New World" [...] a few days later. With the casting of Salonga, Larkin became one of Disney's first voice actors to not provide the singing voice of the character she voices, and thus Jasmine {{marked the first time}} Disney decided to separate a character's speaking and singing voices. Describing Salonga as [...] "an incredible singer", Larkin herself was pleasantly surprised by how much Salonga's voice resembled her own when she first heard [...] "A Whole New World", joking, [...] "the filmmakers almost had me convinced that <b>I</b> <b>sang</b> it".|$|E
500|$|... "We're from America" [...] is {{the most}} overtly {{political}} song on the album, referencing various aspects of neoconservatism in its lyrics, such as pro-war and anti-abortion rhetoric. [...] "I Have to Look Up Just to See Hell" [...] was described by The Quietus as a [...] "maggot-infested ride into the trough of melancholy." [...] The penultimate track, [...] "Into the Fire", portrays the vocalists' mental state on Christmas Day—wherein he unsuccessfully attempted to contact Wood 158 times, and cut himself on the hands or face with a razorblade for each corresponding attempt. It was the original album closer, with Manson describing it as a [...] "glorious epic that I think will make Twiggy forever recognized as a guitar hero." [...] The album's final song, [...] "15", was completed on Manson's January 5 birthday. He called it [...] "the most important song that's been written by Marilyn Manson as an entity. It's the most unusual song I have ever heard. I thought that the album was done, [...] but {{what was happening in}} my life had not resolved itself. So on January 5, one five, <b>I</b> <b>sang</b> '15', and the lyrics tell the story of that day." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Focker" [...] {{was created}} using a looped riff from [...] "6/8 Focker". Eastgate then {{conceived}} a drum solo and remixed and rearranged the last 20 {{seconds of the}} song. [...] "The Enemy Are the Future" [...] was created during a hungover jam session, where all band members played individually and not in tandem. Dawson performed around 40 different beats one after another all in different timings. The session was recorded using a tape player and a track was moulded in the studio. Four different endings were recorded and three were spliced together at the end. [...] "Mad Dogs and Englishmen", whose riff {{is based on an}} old French samba song, was borne out of an interplay between Eastgate on the guitar and Faley on the bass. The last track on the album, [...] "Bathroom Gurgle", includes [...] "a squelchy grind of the riff" [...] purpose-built for the Liars Club audience during the band's first ever gigs. Eastgate has explained, [...] "I had these two themes, which looped round on each other which <b>I</b> <b>sang</b> very exasperated Annie Lennox style vocals over." [...] The fast tempo {{of the first half of}} the song was juxtaposed against a section of [...] "slow drama".|$|E

500|$|In 2004, Charles re-recorded [...] "Here We Go Again" [...] as a {{duet with}} American singer-songwriter Norah Jones, who grew up {{listening}} to his music. During Jones' Billboard interview for her 2010 collaboration album ...Featuring, which included her [...] "Here We Go Again" [...] duet, she said [...] "I got a call from Ray asking if I'd be interested in singing on this duets record. I got on the next plane and I brought my mom. We went to his studio and did it live with the band. <b>I</b> <b>sang</b> it right next to Ray, watching his mouth for the phrasing. He was very sweet and put me at ease, which was great because I was petrified walking in there." [...] She noted in one ...Featuring interview that the only part that was not done live was a piano overlay that she added afterwards to complement Charles' keyboard. In the same interview, she noted that she had been given the opportunity to select a song from Charles' songbook to perform as a duet and felt that this one provided the best opportunity to harmonize rather than alternate vocal verses. On the record, the two singers vocalize, accompanied by Billy Preston on Hammond organ, who had at one time been the regular organist in Charles' band.|$|E
500|$|The project caused {{division}} in Blink-182, mostly between DeLonge and Hoppus. Hoppus {{was interested in}} {{being a part of}} the record, but DeLonge did not want it to turn into a Blink-182 album. DeLonge contended that the involvement of Barker was to refrain from having to pay a session musician. Regardless, Hoppus felt betrayed and unresolved tension dogged the band until their 2005 breakup. [...] "Nobody talked about it. It was this strange situation that nobody addressed," [...] DeLonge told Blender. Barker felt guilty when he told Hoppus they were going to tour in support of the album: [...] "I felt like I had let him down [...] but he was ultimately more upset at Tom because they had ten years of history together before me." [...] Despite this tension, Hoppus lent vocals to the track [...] "Elevator" [...] and shared early ideas for the next Blink-182 album. In a later Reddit AMA, Hoppus concluded, [...] "The whole situation sucked. But <b>I</b> <b>sang</b> on the track because, at the heart of it, Tom and Travis are my friends. I'm sure Tom felt the tension and asked me as an offering. I was glad to have done it, and I was glad that he asked." ...|$|E

The producers also gave O'Hara the option to lip-synch the song. However, she opted to perform it live instead. O'Hara was also forced to wear a rendition of Belle's blue and white costume from the film, of which she was harshly critical because she felt that it was [...] "much too frilly", and Belle is supposed to dress [...] "much simpler." [...] She likened the costume to something that the fairy tale character Little Bo Peep would wear. [...] O'Hara admitted that she was very nervous before her performance. However, actress Angela Lansbury, who provided the voice of the character Mrs. Potts in the film and was to perform [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] at the ceremony, comforted her by telling her, [...] "Paige, if <b>I</b> <b>sang</b> like you I wouldn’t be nervous." ...|$|E

500|$|For {{the first}} time in her career, Gomez was given full {{creative}} control following her signing with Interscope Records. She expressed frustration and constraint with the songs chosen for her earlier in her career, and felt a disconnect from the music both personally and professionally. During the creation of Revival, the singer emphasized the importance of creating a distinct sound for herself, telling Nolan Feeney of Time that [...] "there were times in my career where <b>I</b> <b>sang</b> things that just weren’t me and weren’t for me. You can hear it in my voice. You can hear it when it’s inauthentic." [...] Gomez aimed to create autobiographical songs which shared personal stories, whether or not she wrote them. Citing the therapeutic process of writing [...] "The Heart Wants What It Wants" [...] for her greatest hits album For You (2014), the singer was inspired to separate herself from her peers and convert personal experiences into the music of Revival. For [...] "Sober", Gomez focused on using her unique vocal tone and abilities as an actress to translate feelings and emotions through her music. The singer also told producers to focus primarily on the lyrics and vocals, referencing albums of her youth that dealt with themes of growing up in the spotlight, particularly Christina Aguilera's album Stripped (2002).|$|E

With the way <b>I</b> <b>sang</b> it the first time, I was actually kind of sick, and I knew that he needed the record, so I was like, 'Let me get to it.'" [...] She added, [...] "I came back and revisited it so that it could be what it is now So it actually took a couple of times, but every time, the energy was just so high." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly felt that the singer who sings the song's hook has a [...] "crucial role", believing that [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] is a [...] "smash that concert attendees expect Jay to play, and it just wouldn't work without a big, clear voice to sing that hook". In November 2012, Keys said she had to redo the vocals after Jay-Z said he wasn't happy with her original take. Keys said she had been battling [...] "nasal congestion" [...] when she did the first take.|$|E

In 2008, they performed the song at the same event in the JJB Champion Arena, {{as part of a}} set list which included Push the Button and About You Now. The performance received positive reviews, with a reviewer from MTV UK calling it [...] "a highlight of our festival in the JJB Arena". In August 2007, former group member Mutya Buena, who left the band shortly following the single's release, performed the song at the V Festival in Chelmsford; before playing it, she stated: [...] "This song is one <b>I</b> <b>sang</b> with my previous group...
