5|$|Aposematic animals {{often have}} (honest) threat displays; edible prey {{sometimes}} have (bluffing) startle displays. For example the frilled lizard, Chlamydosaurus kingii, <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> a drawing by Cott, with its tail raised over the body, stretched {{up on all}} four legs, mouth wide open, and frills out {{both sides of the}} head, making it a startling sight.|$|E
5|$|In Baby Face Stanwyck {{moves to}} New York and sleeps {{her way to}} the top of Gotham Trust. Her {{progress}} <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> a recurring visual metaphor of the movie camera panning ever upward along the front of Gotham Trust's skyscraper. Men are driven mad with lust over her and they commit murder, attempt suicide, and are ruined financially for associating with her before she mends her ways in the final reel. In another departure from post Code films, Stanwyck's sole companion for the duration of the picture is a black woman named Chico (Theresa Harris), whom she took with her when she ran away from home at age 14.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese {{government}} forced black Mozambican {{farmers to}} grow rice or cotton for export, providing little return {{with which the}} farmers could support themselves. Many other workers—over 250,000 by 1960—were pressured to work on coal and gold mines, in neighbouring territories, mainly in South Africa, where they comprised over 30% of black underground miners. By 1950, only 4,353 Mozambicans out of 5,733,000 had been granted {{the right to vote}} by the Portuguese colonial government. The rift between Portuguese settlers and Mozambican locals <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> one way by the small number of people with mixed Portuguese and Mozambican heritage (mestiço), numbering only 31,465 in a population of 8–10 million in 1960 according to that year's census.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1750s, even {{the roof of}} Ardincaple Castle, seat of the clan chief, had fallen in. The overall {{condition}} of the castle had deteriorated {{to such an extent}} that the next laird was forced to abandon it and live in nearby Laggarie. The bulk of the Ardincaple estate ultimately passed into the hands of John Campbell, 4th Duke of Argyll. The last chief of the MacAulays, Aulay MacAulay, died at High Laggarie (now encompassed by the tiny village of Rhu) landless and without an heir to succeed as chief in about 1767. In 1794, Lord Frederick Campbell (brother of John, 5th Duke of Argyll) supervised the draining of the marsh and bog-ridden former lands of the Lairds of Ardincaple. The poor state of the lands of Ardincaple before that year <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> the statement by George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll: that much of the land could not bear the weight of a cow, and local men of the time remembered when horses would be lost in the bogholes prevalent in the area.|$|E
