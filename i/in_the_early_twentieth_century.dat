5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> <b>century</b> notable {{photographic}} work in Scotland included that {{of visiting}} artists, such as Alvin Langdon Coburn (1882–1966), whose produced illustrations {{for the work}} of Robert Louis Stevenson and Paul Strand (1890–1976), as well as atmospheric depictions of Hebridean landscapes. There was also the record of the Gorbals in Glasgow made by Bert Hardy (1913–95), Joseph MacKenzie (b. 1929) and Oscar Marzaroli (1933–88), but, having pioneered photography in the late nineteenth century, the artistic attainment of native photographers was not high <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E

5|$|Lions {{were kept}} in cramped and squalid {{conditions}} at London Zoo until a larger lion house with roomier cages {{was built in the}} 1870s. Further changes took place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> <b>century,</b> when Carl Hagenbeck designed enclosures more closely resembling a natural habitat, with concrete 'rocks', more open space and a moat instead of bars. He designed lion enclosures for both Melbourne Zoo and Sydney's Taronga Zoo, among others, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> <b>century.</b> Though his designs were popular, the old bars and cage enclosures prevailed until the 1960s in many zoos. In the later decades of the twentieth century, larger, more natural enclosures and the use of wire mesh or laminated glass instead of lowered dens allowed visitors to come closer than ever to the animals, with some attractions even placing the den on ground higher than visitors, such as the Cat Forest/Lion Overlook of Oklahoma City Zoological Park.|$|E

5|$|Portions of SR 20 {{are built}} near the routing {{of what was}} first a wagon road and later a turnpike {{in the late nineteenth}} century.

5|$|A new {{main drain}} to Wiggenhall St Germans was {{completed}} in 1848, which provided better drainage because the outfall was lower than that at Salters Lode. Whittlesey Mere, the last remaining lake, was drained soon afterwards, {{using one of the}} first applications of John Appold's centrifugal pump, following its appearance at the Great Exhibition in 1851. Traffic on the network began to diminish after the opening of the railway through March in 1846, and fell dramatically <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> <b>century.</b> The last regular commercial traffic was the tanker barge Shellfen, which delivered fuel oil to pumping stations until 1971.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} historians began <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> <b>century</b> to {{question}} if the Imprimerie nationale Latin-alphabet type {{was really the}} work of Garamond, as the Grecs du Roi undoubtedly were.

ATF's historian Henry Lewis Bullen secretly doubted that the 'Garamond' his company was reviving was really Garamond's work, noting that he had never seen it in a sixteenth-century book. He discussed his concerns with ATF junior librarian Beatrice Warde, who would later move to Europe and become a prominent writer on printing advising the British branch of Monotype.|$|E
