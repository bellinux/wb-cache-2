5|$|Cairanoolithus dughii is {{the type}} oospecies. At , its eggshell is {{slightly}} thicker than that of C. roussetensis. It has slender, partially fused columnar eggshell units. Their outer surface is almost without ornamentation, and the <b>inner</b> <b>surface</b> is covered with hollows once filled by organic cores. C. dughiis eggshell exhibits an angusticanaliculate pore system, i.e. its pores are long, narrow, and straight.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{transient}} {{measurement technique}} by using narrow-band thermochromic liquid crystal (TLC) is employed to determine temperature and {{heat transfer coefficient}} (HTC) distribution on <b>inner</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the typical lamilloy configurations. With this technique, both local HTC distribution and average HTC distribution could be obtained. The experimental {{results indicate that the}} variation of the porosity ratio, the one that the area of impingement holes divided by that of the plate, has a great effect on the HTC distribution on the <b>inner</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Heat exchange of <b>inner</b> <b>surfaces</b> varies directly as the porosity ratio. The impingement Reynolds number ranges from 20 000 to 50 000. The average HTC of <b>inner</b> <b>surfaces</b> bears a linear relationship with the Reynolds number...|$|R

5|$|The basidia (spore-bearing cells) of T.tabacinus are {{club-shaped}} {{and measure}} 23.5–37.0 by 8.5–13.0μm. The pleurocystidia (cystidia {{found on the}} <b>inner</b> <b>surface</b> of the tubes) are 45.0–60.0 by 6.5–12.5μm, lanceolate (lance-shaped) to narrowly fusoid-ventricose (enlarged {{in the middle and}} somewhat spindle-shaped). Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the outer edges of the tubes) are absent. The caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) form the reticulations on the stem; they are usually club-shaped and measure 21.0–40.5 by 6.5–10.5μm.|$|E
5|$|The pinna helps {{direct sound}} through {{the ear canal}} to the eardrum. The complex {{geometry}} of ridges on the <b>inner</b> <b>surface</b> of some mammalian ears helps to sharply focus sounds produced by prey, using echolocation signals. These ridges {{can be regarded as}} the acoustic equivalent of a fresnel lens, and may be seen {{in a wide range of}} animals, including the bat, aye-aye, lesser galago, bat-eared fox, mouse lemur and others.|$|E
5|$|About 20,000 protein-coding {{genes are}} {{expressed}} in human cells and nearly 70% of these genes {{are expressed in}} the normal esophagus. Some 250 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the esophagus with less than 50 genes being highly specific. The corresponding esophagus-specific proteins are mainly involved in squamous differentiation such as keratins KRT13, KRT4 and KRT6C. Other specific proteins that help lubricate the <b>inner</b> <b>surface</b> of esophagus are mucins such as MUC21 and MUC22. Many genes with elevated expression are also shared with skin and other organs that are composed of squamous epithelia.|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} forming a sensor {{includes}} providing a first {{and a second}} film and bonding an internal connection tab there between. The internal connection tab is positioned between the <b>inner</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{of the first and}} second film. Then, a conductive adhesive is applied to either the tab or to the <b>inner</b> film <b>surfaces</b> such that the <b>inner</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the film and the tab are electrically connected. Finally, the films are pressed together to bond the film together with the internal connection tab in between...|$|R
5|$|Galiella rufa, {{commonly}} known as the rubber cup, the rufous rubber cup, or the hairy rubber cup, is a species of fungus in the family Sarcosomataceae. The fungus produces cup-shaped fruit bodies that typically grow in clusters on branches and exposed portions of buried wood throughout eastern and Midwest North America and in Malaysia. The fruit bodies have the texture of tough, gelatinous rubber, and have a rough, blackish-brown, felt-like outer surface and a smooth reddish-brown <b>inner</b> <b>surface.</b> Although generally considered inedible by North American mushroom field guides, it is commonly consumed in Malaysia. The fungus produces several chemicals with a variety of bioactive properties.|$|E
5|$|In 1610 the Constable {{gave the}} cup to a convent in Medina de Pomar, near Burgos, as the {{inscription}} describes. His deed of gift survives, and records that the gift was on condition that the cup was never alienated by the convent. A marginal note on the deed, in the Constable's own handwriting, records that he had obtained {{the permission of the}} Archbishop of Toledo, Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas, for {{the cup to}} be used as a ciborium, or container for consecrated hosts. By this period a rule of the church normally forbade the use of vessels decorated on their <b>inner</b> <b>surface</b> as ciboria.|$|E
5|$|On the <b>inner</b> <b>surface</b> of {{the nasal}} section of skull are ridges called nasoturbinals, which may have {{supported}} cartilage that increased {{the area of the}} olfactory epithelium, the layer of tissue that detects odors. These ridges are much smaller than those of later synapsids from the Late Permian and Triassic, whose large nasoturbinals are taken as evidence for warm-bloodedness because they may have supported mucous membranes that warmed and moistened incoming air. Thus, the nasal cavity of Dimetrodon is transitional between those of early land vertebrates and mammals.|$|E

5|$|The Lobata have {{a pair of}} lobes, {{which are}} muscular, cuplike {{extensions}} {{of the body that}} project beyond the mouth. Their inconspicuous tentacles originate from the corners of the mouth, running in convoluted grooves and spreading out over the <b>inner</b> <b>surface</b> of the lobes (rather than trailing far behind, as in the Cydippida). Between the lobes {{on either side of the}} mouth, many species of lobates have four auricles, gelatinous projections edged with cilia that produce water currents that help direct microscopic prey toward the mouth. This combination of structures enables lobates to feed continuously on suspended planktonic prey.|$|E
5|$|The {{brick wall}} around the {{platform}} is in a considerably preserved state as well, although parts of it have broken off. It is quite thickand was presumably constructed to protect the stupa from the sides. There is evidence that <b>inner</b> <b>surface</b> of the wall had been adorned with paintings. Its lower portion is covered by stone panels with carvings of a flower design. Below the wall, {{the side of the}} upper platform itself is decorated with carvings, as is the side of the lower platform.|$|E
5|$|The {{developing}} forebrain {{surrounds the}} neural cord. As the forebrain develops, the neural cord within {{it becomes a}} ventricle, ultimately forming the lateral ventricles. Along the <b>inner</b> <b>surface</b> of both ventricles, the ventricular wall remains thin, and a choroid plexus develops, producing and releasing CSF. The CSF quickly fills the neural canal. Arachnoid villi are formed around the 35th week of development, with aracnhoid granulations noted around the 39th, and continuing developing until 18 months of age.|$|E

5|$|The nuclear envelope's {{structure}} {{is determined by}} a network of intermediate filaments (protein filaments). This network is organized into lining similar to mesh called the nuclear lamina, which binds to chromatin, integral membrane proteins, and other nuclear components along the <b>inner</b> <b>surface</b> of the nucleus. The nuclear lamina is thought to help materials inside the nucleus reach the nuclear pores and in {{the disintegration of the}} nuclear envelope during mitosis and its reassembly {{at the end of the}} process.|$|E
5|$|The pinna {{consists}} of {{a single piece of}} elastic cartilage with a complicated relief on its <b>inner</b> <b>surface</b> and a fairly smooth configuration on its posterior surface. A tubercle, known as Darwin's tubercle, is sometimes present, lying in the descending part of the helix and corresponding to the ear-tip of mammals. The earlobe {{consists of}} areola and adipose tissue. The symmetrical arrangement of the two ears allows for the localisation of sound. The brain accomplishes this by comparing arrival-times and intensities from each ear, in circuits located in the superior olivary complex and the trapezoid bodies which are connected via pathways to both ears.|$|E
5|$|A sponge's body is {{hollow and}} {{is held in}} shape by the mesohyl, a jelly-like {{substance}} made mainly of collagen and reinforced by a dense network of fibers also made of collagen. The <b>inner</b> <b>surface</b> is covered with choanocytes, cells with cylindrical or conical collars surrounding one flagellum per choanocyte. The wave-like motion of the whip-like flagella drives water through the sponge's body. All sponges have ostia, channels leading to the interior through the mesohyl, and in most sponges these are controlled by tube-like porocytes that form closable inlet valves. Pinacocytes, plate-like cells, form a single-layered external skin over all {{other parts of the}} mesohyl that are not covered by choanocytes, and the pinacocytes also digest food particles that are too large to enter the ostia, while those {{at the base of the}} animal are responsible for anchoring it.|$|E

5|$|Cyathus olla bears a {{resemblance}} to a miniature bird's nest containing eggs, hence the common name bird's nest fungi. The fruiting body, or peridium, is roughly funnel-shaped, 10–18mm tall and 8–12mm wide. It is greyish yellow or greyish brown to fawn-colored {{and covered with}} even, fine-textured hairs on the outside surface. The <b>inner</b> <b>surface</b> is silver grey and smooth, often with faint transverse ridges. Cyathus olla is thick-walled, and flared outwards at the rim; the rim is typically wavy in outline. The 'eggs', or peridioles, typically number 8 to 10 in the cup, and they are white or grey in color, with a diameter of 2–4mm—conspicuously larger than other Cyathus species. They are covered with a thin membrane called a tunica.|$|E
5|$|Different glands are {{specialized}} {{for different}} pheromones to attract mates. Pheromones from species of Rutelinae are produced from epithelial cells lining the <b>inner</b> <b>surface</b> of the apical abdominal segments; amino acid-based pheromones of Melolonthinae are produced from eversible glands on the abdominal apex. Other species produce {{different types of}} pheromones. Dermestids produce esters, and species of Elateridae produce fatty acid-derived aldehydes and acetates. To attract a mate, fireflies (Lampyridae) use modified fat body cells with transparent surfaces backed with reflective uric acid crystals to produce light by bioluminescence. Light production is highly efficient, by oxidation of luciferin catalyzed by enzymes (luciferases) {{in the presence of}} adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and oxygen, producing oxyluciferin, carbon dioxide, and light.|$|E
5|$|Many Macroolithus {{specimens}} in South China have {{double- or}} multiple-layering of cones on the <b>inner</b> <b>surface</b> of the eggshell, a pathological condition known as ovum in ovo. It is especially prevalent among eggs nearest to the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary, {{which represents the}} end of the Mesozoic Era. This pathology is correlated with a higher concentration of trace elements like Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr, V, and Zn. Experiments on modern birds have demonstrated that exposure to high levels of these elements will cause them to be incorporated into the eggshell, but the precise mechanism behind the pathological multi-layering is unknown. These abnormalities presumably affected hatchability of the eggs and may {{have played a role in}} the extinction of the dinosaurs. However, the embryonic remains inside three multilayered Macroolithus-like eggs from Ganzhou appear unaffected.|$|E
