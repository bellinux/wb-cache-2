40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} concern about the {{decrease}} in {{the quality and quantity of}} Britain's <b>heaths</b> <b>and</b> <b>moorlands.</b> This concern has prompted attempts to monitor change in <b>moorland</b> vegetation, <b>and</b> programmes of action designed to halt the decline, both nationally and locally (Bunce, 1989; Hudson & Newborn, 1989 a). In northern England the decline has been brought about partly by a reduction in the areal extent of the moors but mainly by changes in their species composition, with Calluna vulgaris (L.) Hull (heather) declining and grasses, Empetrum nigrum L. (crowberry) and other species increasing. These changes have been attributed to changed management practices, such as less effective burning regimes and increased sheep grazing (Bunce, 1989). However, there are few detailed quantitative studies of long-term vegetation change.

40|$|Calluna vulgaris-dominated <b>heaths</b> <b>and</b> <b>moorlands</b> are {{habitats}} {{of international}} conservation importance. Degradation has occurred throughout their range with Calluna typically {{being replaced by}} grass species. The cessation of grazing is often impractical and rarely results in the recovery of Calluna abundance when it is initially present at low cover. Thus the development of restoration methods is required; these should be practical at a large-scale, in remote areas and create suitable conditions for Calluna germination and establishment, whilst still allowing grazing to occur. A replicated field experiment was established on Nardus stricta <b>and</b> Molinia caerulea-dominated <b>moorlands</b> to test the efficacy of different grazing regimes and intervention techniques aimed at establishing Calluna. Disturbance (rotavation and trampling by animals) to create bare ground increased Calluna establishment. On the Nardus site, Calluna establishment was equally successful on rotavated and trampled plots, but rotavation was more successful on the Molinia site. Seeding with Calluna increased Calluna establishment irrespective of whether a seed-bank was present. At the Nardus site, 0. 5 cow/ha for two months in summer led to Calluna establishment and growth {{similar to that of}} ungrazed plots and was more successful than a mixed grazing regime (1 ewe/ha plus 0. 5 cow/ha for 2 months) or a sheep only regime (1. 5 ewes/ha). The creation of small patches of bare ground, seed addition and low intensity grazing enabled the rapid establishment of Calluna on grass-dominated moorlands; such techniques may also be applicable in other habitats where restoration requires the addition of a single/few species and minimal intervention...|$|R

40|$|Corrigiola litoralis L. {{is mostly}} claimed to {{specialize}} its habitat in W. - en C. -Europe on river shores and banks consisting of course {{sand and gravel}} with fluctuating water level. Moreover, this habitat should be restricted to a nitratophilous one; its vegetation belongs to the Chenopodion fluviatile (Bidentetalia). However, this habitat appears to be only one of four main habitat types; it occurs in W. -Germany, N. -France and locally in S. -England. A second habitat type is the slightly ruderal “off the road-locomotion-gradient” along tracks and paths on damp sandy or loamy <b>heath</b> <b>and</b> <b>moorland</b> soil (Spergulario-Illecebretum, Nanocyperion); it is known from the Netherlands and N. -Belgium. The attention in this paper is focussed to a third, apparently very different habitat type: the ecosystem of dry railway tracks, strongly ruderal and consisting of gravel and coarse sand. It has been observed in many localities in the Netherlands {{and it is also}} known from England, Belgium, Denmark and W. -Germany. The fourth ecosystem group consists of ephemeral disturbance communities on sand pits, round about rabbit holes, on burnt moorland etc.; it is intermediate between the second and the third one. The railway track ballast habitat and the river shore gravel one are corresponding in two respects: their “permanent pioneer” character and the coarse texture of the very permeable substrate with its high air content. By these conditions the water regime of the habitat is apparently irrelevant, these environments varying from wet to very dry. Only {{in the case of the}} second habitat type the """"off the road-locomotion-gradient"""" along tracks on sandy moorland the moisture content of the soil is indispensable...|$|E

40|$|We used {{long-term}} data on movements, survival, {{and reproduction}} of female red deer (Cervus elaphus Linnaeus) of the Isle of Rum, Scotland (1970 - 2001), to explain variation in life history (age at maturity) from a hind's access to habitat resources {{and exposure to}} local density, and cross-generational (maternal) effects on observed relationships. We described each hind's use of resources relative to availability {{in the study area}} from an individual-based resource selection function (RSF); we defined local density as the total number of hinds aged > or = 1 year within the subpopulation cluster to which an individual belonged. The likelihood of a hind producing her first calf in the period from birth {{to the end of the}} summer in which she turned age 3 was positively related to relative use of Agrostis/Festuca grasslands and other low-elevation communities, and inversely related to a hind's mean annual local density. However, when we considered both a daughter's RSF and exposure to local density and her mother's RSF and exposure to local density, maternal data alone most parsimoniously explained variation in age at maturity of daughters. Mothers were able to lower age at maturity in their daughters in two, non-mutually exclusive ways. First, birth mass of daughters was inversely related to age at maturity, and mothers that used relatively less uplands (Calluna-dominated <b>heath</b> <b>and</b> heather <b>moorland)</b> <b>and</b> occupied areas of lower density produced larger offspring. Second, mothers could establish a home range that enabled daughters to mature in areas with access to high quality Agrostis/Festuca grasslands at low density. Lifetime reproductive success was inversely associated with a hind's age at maturity via extension of the reproductive life span. Longevity did not change in association with age at maturity. Patterns in how animals use available habitat resources may depend on that of previous generations, especially at larger scales of resource selection...|$|R
40|$|Presence {{of higher}} plant species was {{recorded}} in 1455 permanently marked quadrats located across Britain in 1978, 1990 and 1998 in a stratified, random sample of 259 1 km squares. Significant increases and decreases in frequency of each species were summarised as changes in the representation of simple traits, each of which had an established relationship with varying levels of fertility or disturbance. By testing the null hypothesis that the trait values represented among increasing or decreasing species were a random draw from the 1978 species pool, we determined the consistency of botanical change with changes in land-use in different vegetation types and landscape locations across Britain. Overall, 63 % of significant changes in species occupancy were decreases and 37 % increases. Trait changes were largely consistent {{with the impact of}} increased nutrient availability across vegetation types associated with inherently low fertility, such as infertile grassland, <b>heath,</b> bog <b>and</b> <b>moorland.</b> Linear habitats in lowland Britain saw trait changes consistent with secondary succession. Although trait changes were highly consistent with eutrophication in upland vegetation, the identity of the changing species left open the possibility that increased N deposition, sheep grazing intensity and local improvement could all have played a part. Recent changes in common plant species across Britain suggest that objectives for large-scale restoration and maintenance of plant communities must address four problems: (a) the increasing scarcity of stress-tolerant species in lowland species pools, (b) exploitation and maintenance of species populations on habitat fragments and linear features in the lowlands, (c) the spread and persistence of generalist species in upland Britain, (d) systemic nutrient enrichment in both lowland and upland environments...|$|R
