50|$|The first <b>discotic</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> {{was found}} in 1977 by the Indian {{researcher}} Sivaramakrishna Chandrasekhar. This molecule has one central benzene ring surrounded by six alkyl chains. Since then, {{a large number of}} discoid mesogenic compounds have been discovered in which triphenylene, porphyrin, phthalocyanine, coronene, and other aromatic molecules are involved. The typical columnar liquid-crystalline molecules have a pi-electron-rich aromatic core attached by flexible alkyl chains. This structure is attracting particular attention for potential molecular electronics in which aromatic parts transport electrons or holes and alkyl chains act as insulating parts. The advantages of liquid-crystalline conductors are their anisotropy, processibility, and self-healing characteristics for structural defects.|$|E

We {{have found}} that the discotic nematic liquid crystal, hexakis(4 ‐nonylphenylethynyl) benzene (HNEB), doped with the racemic {{chromium}} complex Cr(Ocacac) 3, shows a novel straight‐needle texture with hexagonal columnar alignments, changing to a curved‐needle texture under irradiation of circularly polarized light (CPL). This novel phenomenon is specific to the mixture of HNEB and Cr(Ocacac) 3. The formation of curved needles means that chiroselective photoinversion of racemic Cr(Ocacac) 3 by CPL irradiation induces a needle direction change in a <b>discotic</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal.</b> The change in chirality of Cr(Ocacac) 3 in HNEB induced by CPL irradiation, and the resulting nano‐segregation of its enantiomers during cooling from the isotropic to mesophase of HNEB, are considered to influence changes in the alignment of columns and/or small domains of column aggregates in the <b>discotic</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of substrate-induced phases in thin films is an intriguing phenomenon {{with the physical}} and chemical factors responsible for their formation are not yet clearly understood. In this article, we present the structure and morphological changes associated with a substrate-induced phase in a <b>discotic</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal.</b> The thin films of the discotic molecule are characterised {{by a combination of}} various X-ray diffraction methods to investigate the structural properties. Atomic force microscopy and polarised optical microscopy are used to determine the thin film morphologies. This is the first experimental proof of the {{presence of}} a substrate-induced phase in <b>discotic</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal,</b> although they are known in thin films of molecular crystals. Moreover, we sought to decipher how the substrate-induced phase behaves with the evolution of time, temperature and changes at the interfaces. This work gives a unique example where the two-dimensional liquid-crystalline phase converts to a three-dimensional crystal plastic phase because of nucleation caused by the solid substrate over a time scale of a month or longer. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

40|$|<b>Discotic</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> {{research}} {{is now more}} than 30 years old, however it is still early days compared with the well-established area of calamitic liquid crystal research which dates back {{for more than a}} century. Since the 1990 ’s there has been great deal of interest in <b>discotic</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> research, due to applications such as discotic compensation films for enhancing liquid crystal display (LCD) viewing angles and exciting new potential applications such as organic semi-conductors and photovoltaics. The work contained in this thesis can be broken down into three major areas: investigation of synthetic methodologies of hexasubstituted triphenylene-based discotic liquid crystals, examination of structure-property relationships within novel triphenylene-based discotic liquid crystalline materials, and the design and mesomorphic properties of novel disc-shaped molecular architectures. The investigation of the synthetic methodologies of triphenylene-based liquid crystals examined two main areas of the synthesis of triphenylene-based discotic materials: iodination reactions to generate valuable intermediates, and the oxidative strategies and methods for the generation of hexasubstituted triphenylenes. These investigations have revealed that careful control over reaction conditions can offer great selectivity in the synthesis of halogenated intermediates for the synthesis of triphenylene-based liquid crystals and that electron rich intermediate species offer the greatest scope for the synthesis of hexasubstituted triphenylenes in good yield and purity. The determination of structure-property relationships within triphenylene-based discotic liquid crystals has examined various peripheral substituents and various near-core modifications to the conventional <b>discotic</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal.</b> A small number of novel spiral-shaped materials have been synthesised, which have revealed interesting mesomorphic properties. These materials have shown the ability to self-organise in such a manner as to fill free space around central disc units so as to generate columnar mesophases in materials which would not otherwise be expected to exhibit mesomorphism.
