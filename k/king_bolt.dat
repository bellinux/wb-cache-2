40|$|Wooden utility poles {{are widely}} used in power {{distribution}} and transmission networks in many countries due to their low initial cost, high durability and electrical properties. However, {{the high number of}} pole failures in the networks due to wood deterioration and pole-top fires has become a major challenge for the network operators in the recent years. This thesis presents an original study of electrical characteristics of a wooden utility pole using finite element analysis and the electrical ladder network model. The influence of high voltage, leakage current and electric field in starting a pole-top fire is studied in order to find a solution to the issue. Firstly, leakage current and voltage distribution of a wooden pole are studied using a three dimensional resistance model based on the electrical ladder network for different scenarios that could occur in practice. The current flow, electric field and voltage distribution of a wooden utility pole are further investigated using finite element analysis. These results confirm that the electrical characteristics of the utility pole change significantly with the moisture content of the environment making the pole vulnerable to fire at high moisture contents. These analyses also show that high voltage and high electric field are present at the metal <b>king</b> <b>bolt</b> and there is a possibility of arcing development near this metal insertion. This thesis next studies the development of arcing in cellulose fibre. In particular, it focuses on arcing in microfibrils found in hardwood, caused by the creeping discharges under AC and DC voltages. The results show that the burning of cellulose materials is caused by sparks and arcing developed on the fibre surface. Higher moisture levels in the fibres reduce the time taken for the creeping discharges to develop into arcing. The results showed that the development of arcing is directly related to creeping discharges. This thesis next studies the creeping discharge and arcing development near wood / metal interfaces in a wooden utility pole. A small scale utility pole is tested in the high voltage laboratory under various configurations to investigate the development of arcing near the <b>king</b> <b>bolt.</b> The results show that arcing eventually develops into burning of the wooden surface near the <b>king</b> <b>bolt,</b> especially when the creepage distance of the insulators is reduced due to surface pollution. Finally, taking all these factors into consideration, a pole-top fire mitigation method using a nonconductive, high-strength <b>king</b> <b>bolt</b> made of fibreglass composite is proposed to overcome the pole-top fire issue. The feasibility of using fibreglass king bolts is studied using finite element analysis and laboratory experiments. The results show that the electric field at the cross-arm is reduced with the fibreglass <b>king</b> <b>bolt</b> and the proposed <b>king</b> <b>bolt</b> reduces the possibility of creeping discharge and arcing development at the cross-arm. The fibreglass <b>king</b> <b>bolt</b> is considered a low cost solution and can be retrofitted into existing distribution poles. This proposed solution has significant potential to eliminate the risk of pole-top fire by reducing the electric field of the bolt / cross-arm junction...|$|E
40|$|Many new {{innovations}} in the pole top equipment were brought onto {{the market in}} recent years. A good example {{of that is the}} stainless steel cross-arm that is designed to replace the conventional wooden cross-arm for pole-top fire mitigation. The main objective {{of this study is to}} compare the thermal characteristics on both the stainless steel cross-arm and the wooden cross-arm at different leakage current levels. Our results show that the stainless steel arm has similar heat dissipation property at low current level of 10 mA compare with wooden cross-arm. However, at a current level of 90 mA, the build-up of heat causes the <b>king</b> <b>bolt</b> junction to heat up dramatically and smouldering of the wooden pole was observed. The time-lapse thermographic images of the heating process are presented. This paper also presents a low-cost solution of which the leakage current at the <b>king</b> <b>bolt</b> junction can be reduced...|$|E

This paper examines the leakage current distribution originating from the high voltage conductor to various locations through the wooden pole of various age profiles. The specimens that are investigated in this paper range from a new sample to an aged pole sample of more than 20 years in service. The main {{results show that the}} aging effect on the wooden pole has great effect on the wood resistance. The decaying of the wood reduces the wood resistance and thus increases the leakage current. Thermal images showing heating of the <b>king</b> <b>bolt</b> due to leakage currents are also presented...|$|E

40|$|Non-destructive {{methods are}} making a fast {{progress}} due to extensive scientific treatment and practical applications of new testing techniques. The application of individual techniques requires of their users good knowledge of the relevant theory {{and a lot of}} experience. The experience is the main guideline in choosing the right testing technique. The paper focuses on the ultrasonic testing methods developed for the application to railway vehicles. In order to detect in time initial cracks at vital parts such as <b>king</b> <b>bolts,</b> suspension, and particularly bogie axles of locomotives and wagons, efficient testing equipment and software support are required. This is a prerequisite for safe and reliable railway traffic. With a view to improve the classical ultrasonic testing method designed for machine parts, an interface was constructed and software elaborated for the purpose. A relevant description follows. Lately ultrasonic defectoscopy experienced exceptional advances as far as the apparatuses measuring, saving and processing ultrasonic signals are concerned. This should be followed by an advance of software. Some latest approaches to testing of railway tracks and vital machine parts, particularly those of railway vehicles such as wagons and locomotives of German Bundesbahn, will be described...|$|R

40|$|The power {{distribution}} and transmission networks in many countries use wood for fabricating service poles for the overhead power lines. In this paper, we model a wooden pole used in an 11 kV three phase distribution system. We use this model to study the electric fields induced in the wooden supporting structures, {{in order to determine}} the possibility of micro arcing inside them, using Finite Element Analysis. The three dimensional model takes into consideration both the resistive and capacitive properties, and closely resembles the actual pole. We show that the electric field distribution of the utility pole changes significantly with the change of weather conditions, and the size of the air gap at the wood-metal interface where the electric field is at its maximum. Also, we show that the electric field in this gap can be reduced significantly by modifying the <b>king</b> <b>bolt</b> using an epoxy coating. This reduction will minimize the chance of micro arcing inside the air gap near the bolt, which will reduce the long term degradation of the wooden structure...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an original study of pole-top fire in electrical distribution networks {{by using the}} ladder network model. A new mid-pole bonding mitigation method has been proposed and developed in this research to overcome the pole-top fire issue. A complete wooden pole model with cross-arm has been developed for further investigation of pole-top fire. Leakage current concentration at the wood-bolt insertion is demonstrated by significant information about radial current distribution along wooden pole structures. Replacing wood with steel cross-arm was unsuccessful in decreasing the fire-prone risk. On the other hand, Ross shunting methods depict a similar result and caused higher current concentration on the <b>king</b> <b>bolt</b> insertion compared to wood and steel cross-arm. A time-lapsed thermographic study on wood and steel cross-arms with poles {{has shown that the}} temperatures that developed on the king bolts were almost similar for both materials. The application of a mid-pole bonding system on a wooden pole structure proved successful in reducing the pole-top fire risk by at least 50 %. The mid-pole bonding system offers better performance compared to the current method. This new system will provide a better solution for the pole-top fire problem...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} and transmission networks are two vital components of a reliable power system. When considering these networks, many countries use wood for fabricating service poles for the overhead power lines. A main disadvantage of using wooden poles is the formation of pole top fires, which initiates catastrophic events such as bushfires. This paper studies the leakage current distribution of a wooden pole which contains an inserted <b>king</b> <b>bolt</b> used to support the cross arm. A three dimensional resistance model is built up based on the electrical ladder network, and the leakage current is simulated for different scenarios that could occur in practice. The analysis show that {{a large part of}} the leakage current passes through the heartwood to the ground, except in the area of the metal bolt. This current increases at high moisture contents making the pole vulnerable to fire. The location of the bolt affects the leakage current as well, and the current reduces when the location of the bolt is varied along the length of the pole from top to bottom. The results also show that this model is superior to a two dimensional model, with a clear deviation in the actual current flow patterns...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{non-destructive}} testing methods adapted to railway vehicles permit timely repair or discarding of built-in parts, and, consequently, reliable operation. Rapid advances in testing equipment for railway vehicles {{make it possible}} to employ them in practice although purchasing options are very limited. Users, i. e. operators, shall have good knowledge of theory and practical experience in using these techniques. The paper focuses on the employment of ultrasonic testing methods developed for and adapted to testing of railway vehicles. For timely detection of initial cracks at vital parts such as <b>king</b> <b>bolts,</b> spring suspensions and particularly axles and shafts of bogies for locomotives and coaches, good testing equipment and software support shall be provided. This is a basis of quality testing and assessment of the state of vital parts of railway vehicles, which will eventually assure safe and reliable railway traffic. Recently ultrasonic testing has shown exceptional advances in apparatuses for measurement, storage, and processing of ultrasonic signals. The advances in equipment shall be accompanied by advances in software since {{this is the only way}} to provide adequate graphical representations and support in an analysis to result in reliable assessment of the state of vital parts of railway vehicles. Adequate software will allow checking of the state of individual vital parts between periodic checks, good statistical processing of the data obtained, and quality assessment of the momentary state of railway vehicles resulting in efficient and rational scheduling of periodic checks. Some recent approaches to testing of vital parts railway vehicles such as locomotives and coaches will be described. 1...|$|R
