5|$|Bondfield {{had helped}} Mary Macarthur to found the National Federation of Women Workers (NFWW) in 1906. This {{organisation}} {{was dedicated to}} the unionisation of women, and by 1914 had more than 20,000 members. In 1915 Bondfield became NFWW's organising secretary. Together with Macarthur, Phillips and Susan Lawrence, she established the Central Committee for Women's Employment, which organised relief work for the female unemployed. Bondfield's investigations into workers' pay revealed considerable differences between the rates paid to men and to women, even for identical work.

5|$|The {{automobile}} unions {{played a}} leading role in advancing the cause of women's rights. In 1955, the United Auto Workers Union (UAW) organized the UAW Women's Department to strengthen women's role in the union and encourage participation in the union's elected bodies. In a move that was met with some hostility by Teamsters leaders, the U.S. Division of Transport Personnel had in 1943 instructed Teamsters Union officials that women should be allowed full employment as truck drivers. That proved to be only a temporary wartime measure, but a change of heart among Teamsters leadership by the mid-1950s led to the <b>Equal</b> <b>Pay</b> Act of 1963. Women in the auto industry were considered leaders in the movement for women's rights.|$|E
5|$|The early women’s {{movement}} in China focused on eradicating {{the assumption that}} women were inferior to men. The early reformers believed that women needed help to improve their own attitudes about themselves, since even the women generally considered themselves to be inferior to men.

During the 2nd National Congress in 1922, the CCP issued a statement arguing {{for the end of}} Chinese traditions that repress women. The CCP also released a formal letter ensuring equality under the law for both men and women, and guaranteed <b>equal</b> <b>pay</b> for both genders during the 3rd National Congress.|$|E
5|$|Chastain is a feminist, and {{has often}} spoken against the {{discrimination}} faced {{by women and}} minorities in Hollywood. She wrote an opinion column on gender imbalance in the industry for a December 2015 issue of The Hollywood Reporter. At the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, where she served as a jury member, Chastain bemoaned the passive portrayal of women in most films. She has complained about a lack of female film critics, which she believes hinders a gender-neutral perspective on film. Among other issues, she is vocal in her support for <b>equal</b> <b>pay</b> in the workplace, and has rejected offers of work that she thought were unfair. In 2013, Chastain lent her support to the Got Your 6 campaign, to help empower veterans of the United States Army, and in 2016, she became an advisory-board member to the organization We Do It Together, which produces films and television shows to promote the empowerment of women. Chastain has campaigned for access to affordable reproductive health care for women, and in 2017, Variety honored her for her work with Planned Parenthood.|$|E

5|$|During Grant's {{presidency}} {{the early}} Women's suffrage movement led by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton gained national attention. Anthony lobbied for female suffrage, equal gender pay, {{and protection of}} property for women who resided in Washington D.C. In April 1869, Grant signed into law the protection of married women's property from their husbands' debts and the ability for women to sue in court in Washington D.C. In March 1870 Representative Samuel M. Arnell introduced a bill, coauthored by suffragist Bennette Lockwood, that would give women federal workers <b>equal</b> <b>pay</b> for equal work. Two years later Grant signed a modified Senate version of the Arnell Bill into law. The law required that all federal female clerks would be paid the fully compensated salary, however, lower tiered female clerks were exempted. The law increased women's clerk salaries from 4% to 20% during the 1870s, however, the culture of patronage and patriarchy continued. The Republicans, who needed women to campaign for Grant in the 1872 Presidential Election, added to their platform open discussion of women's rights.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} written by Carter and Spotnitz and {{directed}} by series regular Rob Bowman. In addition to Mulder, Scully, Skinner and Cigarette Smoking Man, it featured guest appearances by Martin Landau, Armin Mueller-Stahl and Blythe Danner, who appeared only in the film.

Jeffrey Spender, Diana Fowley, Alex Krycek and Gibson Praise—characters who had been introduced in the fifth-season finale and/or were integral to the television series—do {{not appear in the}} film. Although the film had a strong domestic opening and received mostly positive reviews from critics, attendance dropped sharply after the first weekend. Although it failed to make a profit during its theatrical release—due in part to its large promotional budget—The X-Files film was more successful internationally. Eventually, the worldwide theatrical box office total reached $189 million. The film's production cost and ad budgets were each close to $66 million.

40|$|This paper {{challenges}} the economic constraints {{associated with the}} so-called post-industrial trilemma. Following Iversen’s and Wren’s seminal 1998 paper, it has been widely accepted that differential industry-level productivity increases rule out a solidaristic structure of wages, {{due to the fact}} that private services will become priced out of the market. We challenge this assumption both theoretically and empirically. Theoretically, we highlight the questionable assumptions within William Baumol’s 1967 economic model that underpins the trilemma, contrasting it with alternative neoclassical theory and ‘power theories of industries’. Building upon this, we empirically demonstrate that productivity increases have a very small effect upon industry wages. Much more important is the pricing power of an industry, which results from the complex interaction of firms with their physical and institutional environment. Contrary to the trilemma, this suggests that wage increases are not primarily constrained by sectoral productivity increases. More <b>equal</b> <b>paying</b> societies will certainly have a different structure of relative prices for goods and services to unequal ones. Whether they have sufficient demand to ensure high levels of employment in private services depends upon multiple factors that are not fixed but vary by place and over time. We argue that distributional choices over earnings continue to be open to social and political influence with much less rigid economic constraints than have perhaps been assumed. ...|$|R
