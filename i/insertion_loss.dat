The limitation of this topology is that performance (particularly <b>insertion</b> <b>loss)</b> deteriorates with increasing fractional bandwidth, and acceptable results are not obtained with a Q less than about 5. A further difficulty with producing low-Q designs is that the gap width is required to be smaller for wider fractional bandwidths.
