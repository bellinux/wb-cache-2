50|$|Porosity Sealing or Resin Impregnation {{is similar}} to potting, but doesn't use a shell or a mold. Parts are {{submerged}} in a polymerizable monomer or solvent-based low viscosity plastic solution. The pressure above the fluid is lowered to a <b>full</b> <b>vacuum.</b> After the vacuum is released, the fluid flows into the part. When the part is withdrawn from the resin bath, it is drained and/or cleaned and then cured. Curing can consist of polymerizing the internal resin or evaporating the solvent, which leaves an insulating dielectric material between different voltage components. Porosity sealing (Resin Impregnation) fills all interior spaces, and {{may or may not}} leave a thin coating on the surface, depending on the wash/rinse performance. The main application of vacuum impregnation porosity sealing is in boosting the dielectric strength of transformers, solenoids, lamination stacks or coils, and some high voltage components. It prevents ionization from forming between closely spaced live surfaces and initiating failure.|$|E
50|$|Balanced {{pressure}} molding using fluid as {{the heat}} transfer is commercially practiced as the 'quickstep' process. This process, however, lacks the high pressures of RTM or autoclave curing so does not typically achieve {{the high quality}} associated with aerospace and autoclave curing. This process allows for the curing, partial curing, and joining of composite materials. The process involves a fluid-filled, pressure balanced, heated floating mould technology. The heated floating mold technology used within the process works by rapidly applying heat to the laminate which is trapped between a free floating rigid or semi-rigid mold that floats in, and is surrounded by, a heat transfer fluid (HTF). The mold and laminate become separated from the circulating HTF by a flexible membrane. The part, typically under <b>full</b> <b>vacuum,</b> is subject to less than 3 psi (20 kPa) fluid pressure and can be rapidly heated to the desired cure temperature without risk of catastrophic exothermic reaction. The air is then removed under vacuum and the laminate is compacted and heated until the part is cured.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the holographic duality where the CFT side {{is given by}} SU(N) adjoint free scalar field theory. Compared to the vector models, the set of single trace operators is immensely extended so that the corresponding AdS theory also contains infinitely many massive higher spin fields {{on top of the}} massless ones. We compute the one-loop vacuum energy of these AdS fields to test this duality at the subleading order in large N expansion. The determination of the bulk vacuum energy requires a proper scheme to sum up the infinitely many contributions. For that, we develop a new method and apply it first to calculate the vacuum energies for the first few `Regge trajectories' in AdS_ 4 and AdS_ 5. In considering the <b>full</b> <b>vacuum</b> energy of AdS theory dual to a matrix model CFT, we find that there exist more than one available prescriptions for the one-loop vacuum energy. Taking a particular prescription, we determine the <b>full</b> <b>vacuum</b> energy of the AdS_ 5 theory, whereas the AdS_ 4 calculation still remains technically prohibitive. This result shows that the <b>full</b> <b>vacuum</b> energy of the AdS_ 5 theory coincides with minus of the free energy of a single scalar field on the boundary. This is analogous to the O(N) vector model case, hence suggests an interpretation of the positive shift of the bulk coupling constant, i. e. from N^ 2 - 1 to N^ 2. Comment: 67 pages.

40|$|The Goldberg-Sachs theorem {{has been}} very useful in {{constructing}} algebraically special exact solutions of Einstein vacuum equation. Most of the physical meaningful vacuum exact solutions are algebraically special. We show that the Goldberg-Sachs theorem is not true in linearized gravity. This is a remarkable result, which gives light on {{the understanding of the}} physical meaning of the linearized solutions. PACS numbers: 04. 20 -q, 04. 25 -g Solutions of the linearized Einstein vacuum equation are usually considered as approximations of solutions of the <b>full</b> <b>vacuum</b> equation. They are useful tools for describing physical systems. It is important to understand the relation between the <b>full</b> <b>vacuum</b> equation and the linearized one; in particular it is interesting to know which properties are common, or not, to both sets of solutions. An example of a common property is the Birkhoff’s theorem; which can be enunciated in the following way: vacuum spherically symmetric solutions are static. This statement remains true in linearized gravity (i. e., if we replace the vacuum equation by the linear one); as one can check by reconstructing the linear version of the standard proofs that appear in the literature. In this work we present an example of a property, the so called Goldberg-Sachs theorem[1], which is not common to both set of solution. The Goldberg-Sachs theorem for the Einstein vacuum equation relates algebraic properties of the Weyl tensor with the existence of a null, geodesic, shear-free congruence in the space-time. In the search of vacuum solutions, the existence of such a congruence leads to considerable simplification in the calculation...|$|E

Independent of the precise vertex function, there is a critical number of fermion flavors for dynamical mass generation in $(2 + 1) $-dimensional QED.

50|$|The cosmological {{constant}} has negative pressure equal to its energy density and so causes {{the expansion of}} the universe to accelerate. The reason a {{cosmological constant}} has negative pressure can be seen from classical thermodynamics. In general, energy must be lost from inside a container (the container must do work on its environment) in order for the volume to increase. Specifically, a change in volume dV requires work done equal to a change of energy −P dV, where P is the pressure. But the amount of energy in a container <b>full</b> of <b>vacuum</b> actually increases when the volume increases, because the energy is equal to ρV, where ρ is the energy density of the cosmological constant.
