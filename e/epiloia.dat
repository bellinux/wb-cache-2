He coined the term <b>epiloia,</b> a portmanteau of epilepsy and anoia (mindless). The word is no longer widely used as a synonym for TSC. The geneticist Robert James Gorlin suggested in 1981 {{that it could be}} a useful acronym for epilepsy, low intelligence, and adenoma sebaceum.|$|E
40|$|Apart from adenoma sebaceum, {{involvement}} of the skin and subcutaneous tissues is a well-known finding in cases of <b>epiloia</b> or tuberous sclerosis. A variety of manifestations occurs, the most frequently noted ones including adenoma sebaceum itself, shagreen plaques, subungual and other small fibro-mata, cafe-au-lait spots, and areas of depigmented skin. A comprehensive review of the dermato-logical aspects of the disease was published by Butterworth and Wilson (1941) who summarized the many abnormalities that had been observed. We recently saw a child in Cell Barnes hospital who, {{in addition to the}} typical clinical features of <b>epiloia</b> (in particular, epilepsy, mental defect, and adenoma sebaceum), developed superficial tumour...|$|E
40|$|A heredo-familial {{study of}} {{patients}} suffering from adenoma sebaceum, a rare cutaneous disease-is presented. Previously similar study {{was done in}} patients suffering from <b>epiloia,</b> a combination of adenoma sebaceum, mental deficiency and epilepsy. The heredofamilial study of cases with adenoma sebaceum only, is not available in literature- The study revealed thatit is transmitted asautosomal dominant. The lesions donotap before 12 years of age...|$|E
40|$|Tuberous {{sclerosis}} complex (TSC) is a multisystem, {{autosomal dominant}} disorder affecting children and adults, resulted from mutations {{in one of}} two genes, TSC 1 (encoding hamartin) or TSC 2 (encoding tuberin) genes located on chromosomes 9 and 16 respectively. 1, 2 Synonyms of TSC are Bourneville Pringle syndrome, <b>epiloia,</b> or tuberosclerosis. This disorder is characterized by seizures, mental disability, and small noncancerous tumors on the skin and other body tissues, such as brain, eye, lung, and kidney. The classic triad are seizures, mental retardation, and cutaneous angiofibromas. ...|$|E
40|$|Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, {{also known}} as <b>Epiloia</b> or Bourneville-Pringle disease is an {{autosomal}} dominant neurocutaneous syndrome with variable clinical expression. It is a multisystem disorder that {{may be associated with}} hamartomas in multiple organs in an unpredictable manner. The dermatologist plays an essential role {{in the history of the}} disease, since skin manifestations represent the most prevalent clinical features, enabling early diagnosis and intervention in its natural course. This article aims to inform the scientific community about advances made in the study of genetics and molecular biology. Recent findings regarding stimulation of tumor growth have been changing the history of this condition, making therapeutic trials with topical and systemic drugs possible. Knowledge of these topics enables better management of the patients affected, since tissue replacement by tumors can result in significant morbidity and mortality...|$|E
40|$|At present, many genetic diseases, from 85 to 90 %, are {{considered}} rare diseases, since they affect {{a small number}} of individuals. The poor knowledge about them makes it difficult to diagnose them; they are chronic, incapacitating, with few therapeutic options diseases and often makes the patientsâ€™ adequate social integration impossible. The genodermatosis are part of the group of rare, uncommon and difficult to diagnose skin diseases; they are a frequent cause of stigmatization of those people who suffer from them. They may include: ichthyosis, epidermolysis bullosa, mastocytosis, neurofibromatosis, ectodermal dysplasia, palmoplantar keratoderma, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, incontinentia pigmenti, pityriasis rubra pylaris, xeroderma pigmentosum, <b>epiloia,</b> Darier's disease, and vascular tumors, among others. It is necessary to increase knowledge about them in the field of medical sciences, allowing a better treatment for patients and improve their quality of life, as well as contribute to their prevention. </p...|$|E
