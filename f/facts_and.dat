5|$|I have {{a rather}} more {{favourable}} {{opinion of the}} 'Vestiges' than you appear to have. I do not consider it a hasty generalization, but rather as an ingenious hypothesis strongly supported by some striking <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> analogies, but which remains to be proven by more <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> the additional light which more research may throw upon the problem. It furnishes a subject for every student of nature to attend to; every fact he observes will make either for or against it, and it thus serves both as an incitement to the collection of <b>facts,</b> <b>and</b> an object to which they can be applied when collected.|$|E

5|$|A {{few months}} ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best {{intentions}} still tell me that's true, but the <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> the evidence tell me it is not. As the Tower board reported, {{what began as a}} strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages. This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} factors, {{including}} the bizarre <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> Cardozo's outstanding reputation, {{made the case}} prominent in the legal profession, and it remains so, taught to {{most if not all}} American law students in torts class. Cardozo's conception, that tort liability only occurs when a defendant breaches a duty of care the defendant owes to a plaintiff, causing the injury sued for, has been widely accepted in American law. In dealing with proximate cause, many states have taken the approach championed by the Court of Appeals' dissenter in Palsgraf, Judge William S. Andrews. Some legal scholars in recent years have criticized Cardozo for not taking into account Palsgraf's impoverished circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Amnesty International {{called the}} {{conviction}} “a bitter blow {{for freedom of}} expression”. Hugh Williamson, of Human Rights Watch, stated that the “charges and verdict … distort both the <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> the law.... These women {{should never have been}} charged with a hate crime and should be released immediately.” ARTICLE 19, Freedom House, and the International Federation for Human Rights also issued statements condemning the sentence. On September 21, 2012, the Feminist Press published an e-book entitled Pussy Riot! A Punk Prayer for Freedom to raise funds for the legal defense team.|$|E
5|$|Animal Coloration, or in full Animal Coloration. An {{account of}} the {{principal}} <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> theories relating to the colours and markings of animals, is a book by the English zoologist Frank Evers Beddard, published by Swan Sonnenschein in 1892. It formed part of the ongoing debate amongst zoologists about the relevance of Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection to the observed appearance, structure, and behaviour of animals, and vice versa.|$|E

Earp declined because he was already collaborating with John Flood. Burns visited Tombstone and based on what he learned decided instead to focus his book on Doc Holliday. He pestered Earp for <b>facts,</b> <b>and</b> on March 27 the next year, Earp finally responded to Burns' repeated requests in an 11-page letter outlining the basic facts from Earp's point of view.|$|E
5|$|Football lore has {{numerous}} legends relating {{when and}} where the bicycle kick was first performed and who created it. According to Brazilian anthropologist Antonio Jorge Soares, the bicycle kick's origin is important only {{as an example of}} how folklore is created. Popular opinion continues to debate its exact origin, particularly in the locations where the manoeuvre was allegedly created (e.g., Brazil, Chile, and Peru). Regardless, the available <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> dates tell a straightforward narrative.|$|E
5|$|In Demosthenes's initial {{judicial}} orations, {{the influence}} of both Lysias and Isaeus is obvious, but his marked, original style is already revealed. Most of his extant speeches for private cases—written early in his career—show glimpses of talent: a powerful intellectual drive, masterly selection (and omission) of <b>facts,</b> <b>and</b> a confident assertion of the justice of his case, all ensuring the dominance of his viewpoint over his rival. However, {{at this early stage}} of his career, his writing was not yet remarkable for its subtlety, verbal precision and variety of effects.|$|E

5|$|On May 24, 1942, Rockwell {{was seeking}} {{approval}} for a poster design at The Pentagon because the Artists Guild had designated that he advocate for the U.S. Army Ordnance Department. Robert Patterson, who was then United States Undersecretary of War, suggested revisions. On the same day, he visited with Thomas Mabry of the Graphic Division of the War Department's Office of <b>Facts</b> <b>and</b> Figures, which coordinated war-themed posters and billboards. Mabry relayed the need for Four Freedoms artwork. Rockwell returned home pondering the Atlantic Charter, which had incorporated the Four Freedoms.|$|E
5|$|S {{is about}} {{voyeurism}} {{as it relates}} to underground films. Interviews with horror film directors and Carol J. Clover, a writer on the horror genre, are weaved between clips from horror films. In the beginning of the film, clips show the directors and Clover commenting on a horror film that is not shown onscreen and with the title not mentioned. The film then moves on to Petty's meetings with Eric Rost (Erik Marcisak), Bill Zebub, and Fred Vogel. He interviews these men and actress Debbie D., while clips from horror films and <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> opinions provided by Clover about the genre are interspersed.|$|E
5|$|The Liberals made no new, radical {{proposals}} {{during their}} campaign, but instead ran a quiet campaign with occasional {{attacks on the}} opposition parties. They were convinced that the public still supported their party, and that no expensive promises need be made to voters. St. Laurent was made {{the image of the}} nation's prosperity, and the Liberals refused to admit any reason for discontent existed. When Minister of Finance Harris proposed raising the upcoming increase in old age pension by an additional four dollars a month, St. Laurent refused to consider it, feeling that the increase had been calculated {{on the basis of the}} available <b>facts,</b> <b>and</b> those facts had not changed.|$|E

5|$|The Life is {{difficult}} to follow and extremely vague on any facts. Typically the author takes <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> traditions known to him and transfers them to the saint himself. Thus there was in the twelfth century a holy relic at Llanbadarn {{believed to have been}} Padarn's staff, Cyrwen, which could well be the origin of the place name Llangorwen. The writer obviously knew very little indeed about Padarn, except that he was seen as a contemporary of David and Teilo, who certainly lived during the sixth century.|$|E
5|$|The first {{symptoms}} are often mistakenly attributed to ageing or stress. Detailed neuropsychological testing can reveal mild cognitive difficulties {{up to eight}} years before a person fulfils the clinical criteria for diagnosis of AD. These early symptoms can affect the most complex activities of daily living. The most noticeable deficit is short term memory loss, which shows up as difficulty in remembering recently learned <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> inability to acquire new information.|$|E
5|$|Whatever one's {{suspicions about}} its use or {{abuse of the}} evidence, JFK is a knockout. Part history book, part comic book, the movie rushes toward {{judgment}} for three breathless hours, lassoing <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> factoids by the thousands, then bundling them together into an incendiary device that would frag any viewer's complacency. Stone's picture is, in both meanings of the word, sensational: it's tip-top tabloid journalism. In its bravura and breadth, JFK is seditiously enthralling; in its craft, wondrously complex.|$|E
