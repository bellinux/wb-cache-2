40|$|Purpose: Thermoradiotherapy {{has been}} shown in several {{randomized}} trials to increase local control compared to radiotherapy alone. The first randomized study of interstitial hyperthermia in glioblastoma multiforme showed a survival benefit for hyperthermia, though small. Improvement of the heating technique could lead to improved results. The purpose of this feasibility study is to present the clinical and thermal data of application of an improved interstitial hyperthermia system. Methods and materials: Six patients with a glioblastoma multiforme were treated with interstitial hyperthermia using the Multi Electrode Current Source Interstitial Hyperthermia (MECS-IHT) system. The MECS-IHT system has the capability of spatial monitoring of temperature and individually steering of <b>heating</b> <b>electrodes.</b> Three sessions were given aiming at a steady state temperature of 42 degreesC for 1 h, with an interval of 3 - 4 days, during an external irradiation scheme of 60 Gy in 6 weeks. Hyperthermia was delivered with a mean of 10 catheters, 18 <b>heating</b> <b>electrodes</b> and 38 thermal probes per patient. Results: Sub-optimal temperatures were encountered in the first two patients leading to adjustments in technique thereafter with subsequent improvement of thermal data. With a catheter spacing of 11 - 12 mm, measurements yielded a mean T- 90, T- 50 and T- 10 of 39. 9, 43. 7 and 45. 2 degreesC, respectively, over three sessions in the last patient. The power per electrode to reach this temperature distribution varied from 25 - 100 % of full power {{in each of the last}} four patients. Thermal data were reproducible over the three sessions. Acute toxicity was minimal. Conclusions: Despite the spatial steering capabilities of the MECS-IHT system, a large temperature heterogeneity was encountered. The heterogeneity was the reason to limit the catheter spacing to 11 - 12 mm, thus making only small tumour volumes feasible for interstitial heatin...|$|E

50|$|Emissive probes use an <b>electrode</b> <b>heated</b> either {{electrically}} or by {{the exposure}} to the plasma. When the electrode is biased more positive than the plasma potential, the emitted electrons are pulled {{back to the surface}} so the I-V characteristic is hardly changed.

40|$|It’s {{widely known}} that {{microwaves}} {{can be a}} useful tool {{when it comes to}} heating many different kinds of materials. It’s much less known however that compared to regular convective heating it can exhibit catalytic properties. This project focuses on the difference between microwave heating and normal heating and its future in the field of solar cell manufacturing. The main purpose was to determine whether efficient DSSC could be manufactured by the use of microwaves. Focus was also put on the application for flexible polymers. Polymer sintering requires lower temperatures compared with the normally used substrates and they tend to have lower efficiencies. If the efficiencies can be raised these types of cells can become a cheap viable option by means of the so called roll-to-roll manufacturing. A clear improvement was seen in both efficiency and deviation when sintering by microwave heating compared to that of normal convective <b>heating.</b> <b>Electrodes</b> sintered by microwaves tend to show about double the performance in these cases. Another effect that was examined was the combined heating effect of TiO 2 on conductive substrates. The combined heating of FTO and TiO 2 can be about 30 % higher than the additive heating. This is of course important from the perspective of manufacturing performance. Sintering a pure TiO 2 paste by microwaves on a ITO:PEN substrate a DSSC efficiency of 5. 5 % was achieved which is a reasonably good result when compared with that of other polymer cells. Especially considering that this was a basic test. The electrode was only sintered for 2 min and the paste was simple. This demonstrates that roll-to-roll printed DSSC is not a farfetched concept. Following that further work on similar cells are strongly encouraged. Some work was also put into creating solvothermally grown nanosheets combined with nanoparticles to create a hybrid cell in hopes of lowering electric resistivity and subsequently increasing overall solar cell performance. No real conclusions can be drawn in terms of increased performance. However there might be some indications of decreased losses but more time is needed on experimental work. The current results might however still prove valuable information for some readers. ...|$|E
