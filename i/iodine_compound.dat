40|$|Aerosol {{particle}} number concentrations have been measured at Halley and Neumayer on the Antarctic coast, since 2004 and 1984 respectively. Sulphur compounds {{known to be}} implicated in particle formation and growth were independently measured: sulphate ions and methane sulphonic acid in filtered aerosol samples; and gas-phase di-methyl sulphide for limited periods. Iodine oxide, IO, was determined by a satellite sensor from 2003 to 2009, and by different ground-based sensors at Halley in 2004 and in 2007. Previous model results and mid-latitude observations show that <b>iodine</b> <b>compounds</b> consistent with the large values of IO observed {{may be responsible for}} an incresase in number concentrations of small particles.

50|$|Periodinanes are {{chemical}} compounds containing hypervalent iodine. These iodine compounds are hypervalent because the iodine atom in it {{contains more than}} the 8 electrons in the valence shell required for the octet rule. When iodine is complexed with a monodentate electronegative ligand such as chlorine, iodine compounds occur with a +3 oxidation number as iodine(III) or &lambda;3-iodanes or as a +5 oxidation number as iodine(V) or &lambda;5-iodanes. Iodine itself contains 7 valence electrons and in a λ3-iodane three more are donated by the ligands making it a decet structure. λ5-iodanes are dodecet molecules. In an ordinary <b>iodine</b> <b>compound</b> such as iodobenzene the number of valence electrons is eight as expected. In order to get from iodine to a hypervalent <b>iodine</b> <b>compound</b> it gets oxidized with removal of first 3 electrons and then 5 electrons. The ligands in turn contribute electrons pairs and form coordinate covalent bonds by adding a total of 6 or 10 electrons back to iodine.

5000|$|In {{the first}} step of the {{proposed}} reaction mechanism the acetyl groups in the <b>iodine</b> <b>compound</b> are replaced with the phenol. This complex dissociates into an aryl radical anion and a phenoxy residue. The two aryl radicals recombine forming a new carbon carbon covalent bond and subsequently lose two protons in a rearomatization step. The immediate reaction product is a diphenoquinone as result of a one-step 4-electron oxidation. It is nevertheless possible to synthesize the biphenol compound via a comproportionation of the quinone with xylenol already present. In this reaction sequence the hypervalent iodine reagent is eventually reduced to phenyliodine.|$|E

Unsymmetrical diaryliodonium salts provide varying degrees of selectivity during reactions with nucleophiles where one aryl group is preferentially transferred to the nucleophile.

This research finds practical application as it relates to Positron Emission Tomography (PET).

40|$|In this thesis, {{new methods}} for iron-catalyzed bond forming {{reactions}} between carbon and heteroatoms were developed. The {{first part of}} the thesis was dedicated to the aziridination reaction of olefins by nitrene group transfer. Commercial Fe(acac) 3 served as the iron source. The nitrene was formed in situ from an aromatic sulfonamide and a hypervalent <b>iodine</b> <b>compound</b> under basic conditions. The conversion of various aromatic olefins gave moderate yields. The reaction mechanism was studied using ESI mass spectrometry. Further, the applicability of soluble iminoiodinanes as nitrene sources was investigated. A second system for the iron-catalyzed aziridination of olefins made use of Fe(OTf) 2 as iron source in combination with a preformed iminoiodinane bearing a pyridine backbone. The use of a ligand and an ionic liquid allowed the isolation of the corresponding aziridines in moderate to very high yields. The method was applicable to a broad spectrum of substrates. The last part of the thesis was dedicated to the development of an iron-catalyzed protocol for the P-arylation of secondary phosphines.

40|$|The {{first part}} of thesis {{describes}} the synthesis of carbonyl compounds from the styrene and derivatives using [hydroxy(tosyloxy) iodo]benzene, a hypervalent <b>iodine</b> <b>compound,</b> and p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate. Four equivalents of hypervalent iodine reagent was necessary to provide the products in high yields. The reaction was performed at 70 °C under argon to avoid further oxidation of benzaldehyde to carboxylic acid. Electron rich styrenes were converted into benzaldehydes in good to high yield, whereas electron deficient styrenes produced bis(tosylates) as the major products. Three paths were possible for the high yield of aldehydes (i) cleavage of glycol intermediate; (ii) cleavage of the epoxide intermediate; (iii) further oxidative cleavage of the rearrangement product - phenylacetaldehydes. The {{second part of the}} thesis describes the synthesis of substituted 1, 2, 4 -oxadiazoles from aldoximes. Hypervalent iodine was used at stoichiometric and catalytic level to synthesize 1, 2, 4 -oxadiazoles. The reaction was believed to proceed through nitrile oxide as an intermediate, followed by 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition with nitriles. Moderate yield was obtained when benzonitrile was used, whereas poor yield was obtained with acetonitrile. The possible reason for moderate yield was mainly attributed to two factors: (i) elimination of water molecule from aldoximes; (ii) diastereomeric purity of aldoxime.
