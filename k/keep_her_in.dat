A faction within Congress {{wanted to keep the}} ship, but the new nation did not have the funds to <b>keep</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> service. Other than a general lack of money, factors for the disarmament of the navy were the loose confederation of the states, a change of goals from war to peace, and more domestic and fewer foreign interests.|$|E

Realizing that Esther is her daughter whom she was told had died — fathered by Hawdon before her current marriage — Lady Dedlock confesses to Esther but swears her to secrecy. Esther is stricken by smallpox and nearly dies; she recovers but is terribly scarred. John proposes marriage to Esther, but though she accepts, he convinces her to keep it secret until she is sure it is what she wants.

She then goes over to Wyndemere to see Nikolas and asks if she can stay with him. Nikolas is not home at the time, and as she searches through his desk to find a paper to leave a note, she is stopped by Mr. Craig (Sebastian Roche), the head gunman from the Metro Court hostage crisis, and finds out he is blackmailing Nikolas for a new identity. When Nikolas returns home, he finds Robin tending to Craig's wound and finds out that Craig had decided Robin might be useful in his blackmail plot. Craig instructs Robin to go about her normal life and not {{to draw attention to}} herself. Also, she cannot not tell anybody—especially Patrick—and he makes numerous threats against Patrick to <b>keep</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> line. Robin goes about his instructions and gets into a fight with Patrick. On March 29, 2007, Patrick goes over to Wyndemere and demands that Nikolas tell him what is going on. Nikolas hesitates and Robin walks in. She can see Craig {{out of the corner of}} her eye, holding a gun. She fears for Patrick's safety, so she lies to him and tells him they are over. Later, Craig decides that a good cover story for Robin living at Wyndemere will be to have Robin and Nikolas play out a very public love affair. They agreed, fearing for their loved ones' lives. At the end of the day, Alexis (Nancy Lee Grahn) walks into Wyndemere, stopping dead in her tracks when she sees Robin and Nikolas in a very delicate position on the couch. The two brush it off as though it is nothing, but Alexis is clearly suspicious. Robin and Patrick are reunited following an almost deadly confrontation with Mr Craig. Once Nik is in the clear for good, Robin and Patrick go home together.|$|E

In an attempt to salvage Gian Gastone from shipwreck, Rinnuci tried to coerce Anna Maria Franziska to return to Florence, where Gian Gastone longed to be. She blankly refused.

At 05:30 on 19 March 1945, possibly while berthed at Kure, the carrier was caught in an air raid by carrier aircraft from the United States Task Force 58. Hōshōs flight deck was damaged by three bomb hits which killed six crewmen. Emergency repairs were made and her captain was ordered to <b>keep</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> readiness on 10 April.

Coolbrith sent a response to Muir, thanking him for [...] "the fruit of your land, and the fruit of your brain".

500|$|Development {{accelerated}} {{in early}} 2010, {{and the project}} was [...] "beginning to cohere as a game" [...] {{around the time of}} E3. Donkey Kong Country Returns was officially announced at Nintendo's press conference held on June 15, with four playable levels available on the show floor. Although the game was set for release later that year, the team still had 70 levels to create or refine. Around the end of development, Tanabe had lower back pain and needed to take a week off. During that time, assistant producer Risa Tabata took over his duties, and Tanabe decided to <b>keep</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> charge for the rest of production. The music, which was inspired by David Wise and Eveline Fischer's score for the Super NES games in the series, was co-written by Kenji Yamamoto, who had worked on the Prime trilogy. Yamamoto wrote songs to fit the mood of certain levels, and some songs were rewritten if their matching levels were heavily redesigned. Takashi Nagasako voiced both Donkey Kong and Cranky Kong, while Katsumi Suzuki voiced Diddy Kong.|$|E

It underperformed at the box office, falling short of its $75million budget, and got largely negative reviews from critics. Next, she once again played Rosalind in Kenneth Branagh's 2006 film version of Shakespeare's As You Like It. It played in theatres in Europe before going directly to cable in the United States, premiering on HBO. Howard was nominated for a Golden Globe Award at the 2008 ceremony. The project got soundly negative reviews from the British media, while American reviewers gave it more favorable notice.

[...] In spite of attempts by citizens' groups to <b>keep</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> Bremerton and be re-opened as a tourist site, the U.S. Navy wanted to pair a symbol of the end of World War II with one representing its beginning. On 4 May 1998, Secretary of the Navy John H. Dalton signed the donation contract that transferred her to the nonprofit USS Missouri Memorial Association (MMA) of Honolulu, Hawaii. She was towed from Bremerton on 23 May to Astoria, Oregon, where she sat in fresh water at the mouth of the Columbia River to kill and drop the saltwater barnacles and sea grasses that had grown on her hull in Bremerton, then towed across the eastern Pacific, and docked at Ford Island, Pearl Harbor on 22 June, just [...] from the Arizona Memorial. Less than a year later, on 29 January 1999, Missouri was opened as a museum operated by the MMA.|$|E
500|$|Kripke cited {{budgetary}} {{reasons for}} Cassidy's departure {{after the third}} season. According to Cassidy, however, Warner Bros.'s uncertainty about what direction to take Ruby in prompted her to leave when the opportunity to star in the series Harper's Island arose. To [...] "make {{the best out of}} a bad situation", Kripke and the writers planned for Ruby to take on a new host every few episodes for the fourth season. They believed this would [...] "keep [...] guessing", and provide a [...] "cool character that most shows don't have the ability to do". Auditions for an unnamed [...] "love interest" [...] were held to recast Ruby with a new actress, and Cortese was hired for the part. She was then informed that she would actually be playing Ruby. Before the first episode she was in aired, however, she was said to be playing [...] "a small-town waitress" [...] named Kristy who had become [...] "romantically involved" [...] with Sam after Dean's death. Cortese played the first of what was expected to be many incarnations of Ruby, but an impressed Kripke ultimately chose to <b>keep</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> the role because she [...] "brought a lot of the different colors and vulnerabilities to Ruby that [...] was really looking for". Although Cortese viewed DVDs of Cassidy's portrayal, she tried to make the character her own at the producers' request rather than emulate Cassidy. She was not as concerned with how Ruby was received by the audience—stating [...] "if people don't like her, they don't like her"—as much as she was with using her performance to [...] "answer questions" [...] about Ruby and her relationship with the Winchester brothers, such as why Sam and Dean were continuing to work with Ruby in the fourth season.|$|E

2500|$|Many of {{the large}} liners were laid up over the autumn and winter of 1914–1915, {{in part due to}} falling demand for {{passenger}} travel across the Atlantic, and in part to protect them from damage due to mines or other dangers.

Lusitania remained in commercial service; although bookings aboard her were by no means strong during that autumn and winter, demand was strong enough to <b>keep</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> civilian service.

The Church, however, intervened to prevent McPherson from receiving psychiatric treatment and to <b>keep</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> Church custody. Records show that she was then placed in a Scientology program, the Introspection Rundown, which was forced isolation used to handle a psychotic episode.
