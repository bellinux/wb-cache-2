Taking advantage of the operon fusion placing the lac operon (responsible for producing beta-galactosidase, a protein which degrades lactose) under the control of an SOS-related protein, a simple colorimetric assay for genotoxicity is possible. If a <b>genotoxin</b> is present, the resulting DNA damage will result in the production of beta-galactosidase instead of DNA repair as a result of the gene fusion. A lactose analog is added to the media which is degraded by the beta-galactosidase, producing a colored compound which can be measured quantitatively through spectrophotometry. The degree of color development is a direct measure of the amount of beta-galactosidase produce, which itself is directly related to the extent of DNA damage.|$|E

Here we investigate this mechanism and show that in transformed MEFs lacking NF-kappa B (p 65 null cells) genotoxin-induced cytochrome c release is compromised. To further address how NF-kappa B contributes to apoptosis, gene profiling by microarray analysis of MEFs was performed, revealing that NF-kappa B is required for expression of Noxa, a pro-apoptotic BH 3 -only proteinthat is induced by genotoxins and that triggers cytochrome c release.

In this study, we investigated the impact of high iron supply on clbA transcription and colibactin production in wild type, Delta ryhB, Delta fur and Delta ryhB Delta fur strains.

Since unpaired bases are thermodynamically unstable and intrinsically mutable, increased transcription could be the cause of hypermutation, and thus cancer. Support for this hypothesis has been obtained by analyzing 6662 mutations in all types of cancer compared to lung and colon cancers, using the p 53 mutation database. The data suggest that <b>genotoxins</b> have two independent effects: first, they induce p 53 transcription, which increases the number of mutable bases that determine the incidence of cancer. Second, <b>genotoxins</b> may alter the fate, or ultimate mutation of a mutable base, for example, by causing more of the available mutable Gs to mutate to T, leaving fewer to mutate to A.

In the pres-ent study, we demonstrate that induction of DNA damage by two bacterial <b>genotoxins</b> promotes activation of integrin β 1, leading to enhanced assembly of focal adhesions and cell spreading on fibronectin, but not on vitronectin. This phenotype is mediated by an ATM-dependent inside-out integrin signaling, and requires the actin cytoskeleton remodeler NET 1. The toxin-mediated cell spreading and anchorage-independent survival further relies on ALIX and TSG 101, two components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT), known to regulate integrin intracellular trafficking.

The bacterial <b>genotoxin</b> colibactin, encoded by the pks genomic island is frequently harboured by Escherichia coli strains of the B 2 phylogenetic group. Mammalian cells exposed to live pks+ bacteria exhibit DNA-double strand breaks (DSB) and undergo cell-cycle arrest and death.

This was accompanied by reactive oxygen species production and pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and proteases secretion.

There is a concomitant increase, in urban populations of developed countries, of immune-mediated diseases along with a shift in Escherichia coli population from the declining phylogenetic group A to the newly dominant group B 2, including commensal strains producing a <b>genotoxin</b> called colibactin that massively colonized the gut of neonates. Here, we showed that mother-to-offspring early gut colonization by colibactin-producing E. coli impairs intestinal permeability and enhances the transepithelial passage of luminal antigen, leading to an increased immune activation.

Conversely, the abolition of colibactin expression by mutagenesis abrogates the alteration of oral tolerance induced by neonatal colonization by E. coli. In conclusion, the vertical colonization by E. coli producing the <b>genotoxin</b> colibactin enhances intestinal translocation and subsequently alters oral tolerance.

However, controversies remain about the interpretation of TP 53 mutational pattern in tumours as the fingerprint of <b>genotoxin</b> exposure.

The active subunit CdtB has structural homology with the phosphodiesterase family of enzymes including mammalian DNase I, and alone is necessary and sufficient to account for cellular toxicity. Indeed, mammalian cells treated with CDT initiate a DNA damage response similar to that elicited by ionizing radiation-induced DNA double strand breaks resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The mechanism of CDT-induced apoptosis remains incompletely understood, but appears to involve both p 53 -dependent and -independent pathways. While epithelial, endothelial and fibroblast cell lines respond to CDT by undergoing arrest of cell cycle progression resulting in nuclear and cytoplasmic distension that precedes apoptotic cell death, cells of haematopoietic origin display rapid apoptosis following a brief period of cell cycle arrest. In this review, the ecology of pathogens producing CDT, the molecular biology of bacterial CDT and the molecular mechanisms of CDT-induced cytotoxicity are critically appraised.

40|$|Dietary {{factors are}} {{important}} in the aetiology of human cancer and carcinogens, mostly heterocyclic aromatic amines, have been isolated from cooked proteinaceous foodstuffs. Whilst such carcinogens have induced tumours in rodent bioassays, the dosages required were much higher than estimates of human exposure levels. We have examined the possibility that <b>genotoxins,</b> which were not extractable prior to enzymic digestion, may be released from cooked beef by proteolysis. Dichloromethane and/or a solid-phase tandem extraction procedure were used with aqueous homogenates of pan-fried or uncooked beef, {{both before and after}} proteolysis (proteinase K). Genotoxicity was measured using the alkaline single cell?gel electrophoresis (?Comet') assay in MCL- 5 cells and mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 1538 or YG 1019. Proteolysis released significant amounts of DNA-damaging material that was not extractible prior to enzymic digestion, suggesting that human exposures to diet-derived <b>genotoxins</b> may have been underestimated...|$|R
