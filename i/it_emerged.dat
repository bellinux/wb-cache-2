Such a view is significant because it allows both luck egalitarians and prioritarians to respond to Voorhoeve and Fleurbaey's charge that they fail to accommodate intuitions about the moral relevance of interpersonal boundaries – the so-called separateness of persons objection. I argue that the view is plausible independently of its ability to answer the separateness of persons objection, and is a natural extension of the luck egalitarian concern with the impact of unchosen circumstance...|$|R

5|$|Despite initial forecasts, the cyclone {{failed to}} {{strengthen}} further due to interaction with Madagascar. Early on February14, Bingiza made landfall along the Masoala Peninsula with winds {{of at least}} 150km/h (90mph). <b>It</b> <b>emerged</b> into the Antongil Bay, before moving ashore north of Manambolosy. It quickly weakened over land, although it produced heavy rainfall along its northern periphery. Early on February15, Bingiza weakened to a tropical depression. The center became difficult to locate over land, although <b>it</b> <b>emerged</b> into the Mozambique Channel north of Besalampy as a tropical disturbance. After moving over waters, the system was able to re-intensify due to favorable water temperatures and inflow. It quickly organized into a tropical depression again, although strengthening was halted after it turned southward over western Madagascar due to a ridge to its north. It again moved into the Mozambique Channel, and Bingiza re-intensified into a tropical storm on February17. The storm developed a concentrated area of convection near the center, {{as well as a}} poorly defined eye. The re-intensification was short-lived after Bingiza made its final landfall just south of Morondava around 1330UTC on February17. Around that time, the circulation was dissipating over land, and its remnants left the island on February19.|$|E

According to Bede, the East Angles (as well as the Middle Angles, the Mercians and the Northumbrians) were descended from natives of Angeln (now in modern Germany). The first reference to the East Angles is from around 704–713, in the Whitby Life of St Gregory.|$|E
