5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the regular season before the Orange Bowl, Virginia Tech's offense was ranked among the worst in Division I, 107th among 119teams. The Hokies averaged just 296yards per game during the regular season, and during the ACC Championship Game—the last Tech game before the Orange Bowl—had created a season-low 234yards of offense. Starting left guard Nick Marshman was not <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> after becoming academically ineligible following the fall semester, and was replaced by redshirt freshman Jaymes Brooks.|$|E
5|$|Following Mazzone's sacking in {{the summer}} of 1996 and the {{departure}} of Giannini, Totti was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a more prominent role, after several promising seasons; however, the team underperformed during the 1996–97 season, while Totti struggled to gain playing time under new manager Carlos Bianchi, and was even set to leave for Sampdoria on loan in January 1997. Roma's chairman at the time however, Franco Sensi, impeded the transfer, leading to further tensions with the manager, who eventually parted ways with the club.|$|E

He finished his sophomore season with 6.7 points and 4.3 rebounds in nearly 17 minutes per game on average.|$|E
5|$|Luck {{distributed}} his passes relatively evenly {{among his}} receivers. Doug Baldwin was the team's leading receiver, with 56 receptions for 824 yards and 9 touchdowns {{during the regular}} season. Wide receiver and kick returner Chris Owusu, who played in only six games because of a knee injury, underwent arthroscopic surgery and was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in the Orange Bowl.

5|$|The period saw the {{establishment}} of a regular system of legal education. In {{the early days of the}} Inn, the quality of legal education had been poor—readings were given infrequently, and the standards for call to the Bar were weak and varied. During the Elizabethan age readings were given regularly, moots took place daily and barristers who were called to the Bar were <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a part in teaching students, resulting in skilled and knowledgeable graduates from the Inn.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{nomenclature}} of Diet (Assembly or Parliament), {{this institution}} should {{in no way}} be construed as a broadly, or popularly, elected group of representatives. Many of the states did not have constitutions, and those that did, such as the Duchy of Baden, based suffrage on strict property requirements which effectively limited suffrage to {{a small portion of}} the male population. Furthermore, this impractical solution did not reflect the new status of Prussia in the overall scheme. Although the Prussian army had been dramatically defeated in the 1806 Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, it had made a spectacular comeback at Waterloo. Consequently, Prussian leaders <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a pivotal role in German politics.|$|E

These games are typically within the clubs' respective divisions, {{with the exception of}} showcase and playoff games. The U-15/16 and U-17/18 teams participate in Summer and Winter Showcases.

Morris entered the season with an unresolved status following a quarterback battle with redshirt freshman Tony Poljan; both were <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in the opener against Rhode Island. Morris ended up playing the majority of the opening triple overtime victory. In week 2, Morris posted 467 yards passing and 5 touchdowns in an upset victory against Kansas. The performance earned Morris recognition as the Mid-American Conference West Division Player of the Week and as one of eight NCAA finalists for the weekly Manning Award for quarterback performances.|$|E
5|$|From 1911 to 1941 {{women were}} {{forbidden}} from {{serving in the}} RAN; the demands World War II placed on personnel and resources led to a change of policy. On 21 April 1941, the Australian Naval Board sent a letter authorising the entry of women into the RAN to the Commodore-in-Charge, Sydney. The letter {{led to the formation}} of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service (WRANS) and the Royal Australian Naval Nursing Service (RANNS). The two separate women's services existed until 1984, when they were incorporated into the permanent force. Today, female members of the RAN have a wide variety of roles open to them; women serve on submarines, command ships and shore postings and are <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> an increasingly important role in the future of the RAN.|$|E
5|$|In August 2017, the Sounds and Nashville SC, an {{expansion}} soccer {{team of the}} United Soccer League, reached a one-year agreement for Nashville SC to play its inaugural 2018 season at First Tennessee Park. Fan support of the team's games {{is expected to be}} a factor in Nashville's bid for a Major League Soccer (MLS) expansion franchise. If the city was to be awarded an MLS team, First Tennessee Park would not be a viable location as the league requires soccer-specific stadiums for new franchises. Instead, the team would play at a new stadium, such as the 30,000-seat facility proposed for the Nashville Fairgrounds. Nashville SC is <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> its first home game as early as March 2018.|$|E

5|$|Relatively isolated, gentry {{families}} {{spent much}} of their time visiting family, friends or neighbours. As a result, hospitality was an important part of life. Leisure activities pursued by the gentry included hunting, cards and chess. Music remained important in noble houses, with accounts listing professional musicians hired to entertain the family and guests. However, professional musicians were expensive to maintain. In the eighteenth century members of the household often provided musical entertainment on the harpsichord, organ and piano. House libraries often contained considerable quantities of music, as at Dalkeith Palace, where the Duke of Buccleuch's daughter collected vocal music between 1780 and 1800. In the nineteenth century it was the women of the family who were the chief performers and men were not <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the piano in drawing rooms.|$|E
5|$|Tech's rushing offense {{featured}} two {{running backs}} who shared {{time on the}} field: Mike Imoh and Cedric Humes. During the regular season, Imoh rushed the ball 152times for 704yards, an average of 4.6yards per carry. He scored fourtouchdowns and set a school record for rushing yards in a game {{when he ran for}} 243yards in Virginia Tech's game against North Carolina. Humes was on the field slightly less than Imoh, but earned 595 yards and five touchdowns on 124 carries. Tech offensive tackle Jimmy Martin was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in the game after recovering from a high ankle sprain.|$|E
5|$|However, some job {{still had}} to be found for Chotiner, who had wound up his California {{practice}} and sold his home. Haldeman refused to have him in the White House, and Nixon's aides deemed that the Democratic-controlled Senate was unlikely to confirm Chotiner for any post requiring its approval. On April 10, 1969, acting Special Representative for Trade Negotiations Theodore R. Gates appointed Chotiner as General Counsel to his office, as almost simultaneously, the White House announced Gates' replacement, Carl J. Gilbert. On April 1, Nixon had issued Executive Order 11463, making the position of general counsel in that office a Schedule C, or political appointment, and significantly raising the salary of the position. Nixon press secretary Ron Ziegler stated that the salary had been raised because the new incumbent was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> {{a more active role}} than had previous holders of the position.|$|E

5|$|Hunt's 2001 {{scholarship}} came {{to fruition}} {{when he joined}} the Brisbane Broncos' main squad {{at the end of the}} 2003 season. He participated in the team's off-season training in early 2004, under the guidance of Broncos' coach Wayne Bennett, and was selected to participate in the Broncos' pre-season trial games in February. Hunt had <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> most of the 2004 season in the Queensland Cup, the second-tier rugby league competition in Queensland. However, after Darren Lockyer's shift to the five-eighth position and Hunt playing both trial games on the wing and scoring a try in the first game against the Melbourne Storm, he was selected to make his National Rugby League (NRL) debut for the Broncos in the first round of the 2004 season against the New Zealand Warriors, making him the youngest ever Bronco at seventeen. Coach Bennett's decision to name Hunt as the starting fullback was somewhat surprising, due to Hunt's original selection, the week before the match, on the interchange bench. He replaced Motu Tony in the fullback position.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{had made}} his {{first-class}} debut for Victoria before World War II as a specialist batsman not known for aggressive play. After the outbreak of war, Miller was deployed to England as a Royal Australian Air Force fighter pilot, flying in combat missions. While playing for military teams, he began to bowl more often, and was selected for Australian Services cricket team, a military outfit, {{to play in the}} Victory Tests against a full-strength England. During this series, Miller gained prominence with a series of hard-hitting displays and some rapid fast bowling against established Test batsmen such as Len Hutton. Miller topped the batting averages and took ten wickets and was hailed for his attacking play. He went on to make his Test debut in March 1946 in a one-off match against New Zealand, but this fixture was not given Test status until 1948. The 194647 Test series against the touring Englishmen would be his first Ashes one, and Miller was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a prominent role with both bat and ball, especially in countering the visitors' powerful batting.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Thornton {{returned}} to New Zealand {{to serve as}} the Quartermaster General of the New Zealand Army, and this was followed as a term from 1956 to 1958 as its Adjutant General. During this period, he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In 1955, New Zealand {{became a member of the}} South East Asian Treaty Organisation (SEATO) and in July 1958, Thornton moved to Bangkok, where he served as head of the Military Planning Office of SEATO. In this capacity, he gained valuable insight in the scenarios in which New Zealand's military might be <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a part. The following year he was promoted to acting major general and appointed Chief of the General Staff (CGS), the youngest ever to serve in this role which was effectively the commander of the New Zealand Army. This was to prove a challenging term for Thornton for, driven by the Labour Government, there was a significant change in New Zealand defence policy. Since the Second World War, defence planning had been based around the concept of an infantry division being raised largely from the Territorial Force. This had now changed to a self-sufficient brigade-sized force made up of a combination of Regular and Territorial Force personnel. While not a policy Thornton personally agreed with, he oversaw the reorganisation that was required to achieve the desired structure and this saw some longstanding regiments being amalgamated. In 1962, part way through his term as CGS, he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath.|$|E
