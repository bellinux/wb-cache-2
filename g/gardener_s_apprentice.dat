50|$|In 1909 the Sunshine Gardens were {{developed}} to provide an amenity for the employees of the Sunshine Harvester Works.> Designed by the assistant city engineer at Ballarat Mr F. A. Horsfall and laid out by head <b>gardener</b> <b>S.</b> G. Thompson, the eight-acre Gardens were sited alongside the factory and incorporated recreation facilities and popular horticultural displays. According to Bill Bampton, the Gardens included tennis courts and pavilion, a bandstand, a bowling green, a substantial house for the head gardener, a conservatory and associated works areas. Under inaugural curator Thompson (1909-27), and curators James Willan (1930-39) and Harold Gray (1939-50), the Gardens developed a reputation for its chrysanthemums and dahlias, attracting workers and their families, {{as well as other}} local residents. In 1953, the management of Sunshine Gardens was handed to the newly established City of Sunshine. At this time, it was renamed the H.V. McKay Memorial Gardens. In the 1990s, the garden was listed by the National Trust of Australia and in the Register of the National Estate. In 2007 the Friends of McKay Gardens was formed to help maintain the gardens.|$|R

40|$|X-linked {{intellectual}} disability (XLID) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. During {{the past two}} decades in excess of 100 X-chromosome ID genes have been identified. Yet, a large number of families mapping to the X-chromosome remained unresolved suggesting that more XLID genes or loci are yet to be identified. Here, we have investigated 405 unresolved families with XLID. We employed massively parallel sequencing of all X-chromosome exons in the index males. The majority of these males were previously tested negative for copy number variations and for mutations in a subset of known XLID genes by Sanger sequencing. In total, 745 X-chromosomal genes were screened. After stringent filtering, a total of 1297 non-recurrent exonic variants remained for prioritization. Co-segregation analysis of potential clinically relevant changes revealed that 80 families (20 %) carried pathogenic variants in established XLID genes. In 19 families, we detected likely causative protein truncating and missense variants in 7 novel and validated XLID genes (CLCN 4, CNKSR 2, FRMPD 4, KLHL 15, LAS 1 L, RLIM and USP 27 X) and potentially deleterious variants in 2 novel candidate XLID genes (CDK 16 and TAF 1). We show that the CLCN 4 and CNKSR 2 variants impair protein functions as indicated by electrophysiological studies and altered differentiation of cultured primary neurons from Clcn 4 (-/-) mice or after mRNA knock-down. The newly identified and candidate XLID proteins belong to pathways and networks with established roles in cognitive function and {{intellectual disability}} in particular. We suggest that systematic sequencing of all X-chromosomal genes in a cohort of patients with genetic evidence for X-chromosome locus involvement may resolve up to 58 % of Fragile X-negative cases.

40|$|Animal welfare issues {{associated}} with whip use during Thoroughbred races in Australia are of increasing importance as the racing industry seeks to promote the well-being of its equine athletes. Recent data have questioned the justification of whip use as either an accelerator or for steering. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate associations between whip use and prerace variables, including jockey experience, starting price, weight carried, and barrier drawn. If the whip is genuinely used in response to a given horse's performance, there should be no consistent predictors of whip use. We explored the influence of these variables on official whip counts for the race section 400 - 200 m from the finish (S 2), and the section 200 m to the finish (S 1), and found that, for S 1 alone and when whip use in S 1 and S 2 was summed (i. e., to summarize the final 400 m of a race), there were no significant predictors on whipping. However, in <b>S</b> 2, <b>apprentice</b> jockeys whipped horses on average > 3 times as compared with the non-apprentice jockeys (1. 48 vs. 0. 45; P = 0. 022). These findings suggest that rider inexperience in Thoroughbred racing influences the distribution of whippings imposed on horses as they tire in the penultimate 200 m section and may contribute to the growing debate surrounding whip use in the sport of horse racing. This preliminary report involved only small numbers of horses and jockeys and thus should be viewed as a trigger for larger scale investigation of the prerace predictors of whip use in Thoroughbred racing...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{split in}} the {{circuits}} regarding whether and when agency regulations may establish rights enforceable through 42 U. S. C. Section 1983. In 1987, in Wright v. City of Roanoke, the Supreme Court held that a statute and regulations interpreting the statute could create enforceable rights under Section 1983, but left unclear to what extent it had relied on the regulations alone to reach this conclusion. The District of Columbia Circuit and Sixth Circuit have held {{that at least some}} valid federal regulations may create rights enforceable through Section 1983. Concluding that only Congress by enacting a statute may create an individually enforceable right, however, the Third, Fourth, and Eleventh Circuits have held that an agency regulation cannot create an individual federal right enforceable through Section 1983. Most recently, in 2003, the Ninth Circuit in Save Our Valley v. Sound Transit held that valid agency regulations alone could not establish individual rights enforceable through Section 1983 because only Congress may establish enforceable rights through statutes, although one judge disagreed in a partial dissent. By contrast, during 2003, the First Circuit in Rolland v. Romney acknowledged that regulations by themselves could not establish enforceable rights, but the court concluded that an agency 2 ̆ 7 s regulations interpreting a statutory right could clarify a right so that it is sufficiently definite to be enforceable through a Section 1983 suit. In Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., the Supreme Court in 1984 stated that courts should give significant deference to agency regulations that provide a reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute or fill a 2 ̆ 2 gap 2 ̆ 2 in a silent statute, at least in those cases in which Congress has delegated to the agency the authority to issue regulations that 2 ̆ 2 carry the force of law. 2 ̆ 2 In 2001, in Alexander v. Sandoval, the Court concluded that a private right of action must be based on rights established in the statute and may not arise from regulations alone, declaring 2 ̆ 2 Language in a regulation may invoke a private right of action that Congress through statutory text created, but it may not create a right that Congress has not. 2 ̆ 2 The Court suggested that regulations alone may not establish individual rights, observing 2 ̆ 2 it is most certainly incorrect to say that language in a regulation can conjure up a private cause of action that has not been authorized by Congress. Agencies may play the sorcerer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>apprentice</b> but not the sorcerer himself. 2 ̆ 2 Although declining to apply Chevron deference in that case because the disparate impact regulations were broader than the statute 2 ̆ 7 s ban on intentional discrimination, Justice Scalia acknowledged in Sandoval that 2 ̆ 2 regulations, if valid and reasonable, authoritatively construe the statute itself. 2 ̆ 2 In 2002, in Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, the Court concluded that individual rights enforceable through Section 1983 are similar to implied rights of action because courts are required to 2 ̆ 2 determine whether Congress intended to create a federal right. 2 ̆ 2 Because the Court held in Sandoval that only Congress can create implied rights of action, the Gonzaga decision suggests that only Congress can create rights enforceable through Section 1983 and that regulations alone may not. The Gonzaga decision did not directly resolve, however, whether and to what extent regulations may interpret rights implicit in a statute. Although acknowledging that special care is required in evaluating the authority of agency regulations purporting to establish individual rights, this Article argues that courts should defer to agency regulations that clarify or further define individual rights reasonably implicit in a statute without contradicting the central underlying principle in Sandoval and Gonzaga that Congress alone possesses the legislative authority necessary to create individual rights in a statute. The First Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s Romney decision {{is a good example of}} a court using agency regulations to clarify the scope of a right that Congress clearly intended to create in a statute, but had appropriately chosen to delegate the details of implementation to an agency. Where Congress mandates or clearly implies that it is delegating to an agency the authority to issue regulations implementing an individual right that Congress intends to create on behalf of a class of individuals then the agency 2 ̆ 7 s interpretation of the statutory 2 ̆ 2 rights 2 ̆ 2 contained in its regulations are presumptively enforceable through Section 1983...|$|R
40|$|Prior to {{the late}} nineteenth century, medical {{understanding}} of "contagion" {{was based on a}} direct two-stage person to person model of transmission, formalised in 1584 by Fracastorius (1484 - 1553). The agents of such disease were demonstrated to be pathogenic microorganisms by Pasteur in his germ Theory of Disease on 1870 - 1880. A new concept - that a living creature, itself unaffected, might be an immediate carrier of infectious disease, a "vector" came late to medical science. This paradigm shift in understanding, that there might be three or even multi-stage links in the chain of transmissibility, was to unlock the secret of prevention in what had hitherto been the killing epidemic diseases of humankind - plague, typhus, malaria and yellow fever. The intermediate causes of these diseases were shown to be arthropods - fleas, flies, lice and mosquitoes. Their discovery as "intermediate agents", over a brief three decades in the late nineteenth century, brought enlightenment to the long-known associations of disease with poor personal and civic hygiene, with swamps and with the miasmata associated with them. Linnaeus (1707 - 1778) was the first to suggest that insects might be carriers of disease, a theoretical idea further reinforced by Ehrenberg in 1838. The Scottish physician, Sir Henry Holland, (1788 - 1873), in his Medical Notes: On the Hypothesis of Insect Life as Cause of Disease, developed this theoretical model further. In July 1878, Pasteur showed that earthworms could carry anthrax ("charbon") spores in the earth casts of their alimentary canals and so be external agents for disease transmission. However, it was the meticulous research of six doctors - Dr Joseph Bancroft (1876) in Brisbane; Dr Patrick Manson (1879) in China; Dr David Bruce (1894) in Africa; Sir Ronald Ross (1897) in India; Dr Thomas Lane Bancroft (1899) in Burpengary near Brisbane in Australia; and Dr Charles-Jules-Henri Nicolle in Tunis in 1909 - who established the science of an extra "intermediate stage" in disease transmission, such links being essential to the lifecycles and hence transmission of the pathogenic microorganisms involved. The primary research linking insects as potential vectors of human disease was undertaken by Dr Joseph Bancroft (1836 - 1894) who identified the adult filarial worm (later named Wucheria bancrofti) in a lymphatic abscess on the arm of a butcher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>apprentice</b> in Brisbane, Australia on December 21, 1876. In 1879, Dr Patrick Manson demonstrated that microfilariae underwent development in the mosquito, thus confirming that mosquitoes could serve as intermediate hosts of parasites which infected vertebrates. A crucial discovery was that of Sir David Bruce, who in 1894 showed that trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) could be passed experimentally from big-game animals to cattle by blood transmission of Trypanosomoa brucei, following the bite of the tsetse fly, Glossina morsitans. This work was followed by the work of Sir Ronald Ross of the Indian Medical Service, who in 1897 demonstrated Plasmodia parasites in the stomach wall of Anopheles mosquitoes which had been fed upon the blood of malarial patients. Bancroft himself believed that mosquitoes sucked up the microfilarial worms and then conveyed them to water by which further victims were infected by drinking. Bancroft 2 ̆ 7 s son, Dr Thomas Lane Bancroft (1860 - 1933) demonstrated in a meticulous series of experiments (1893 - 1901) that the mosquito was the intermediate host ad transmitting agent of Wucheria bancrofti and thus the cause of human clinical filariasis. Although it had been long known that the body louse, Pediculus, was associated with typhus, it was not until 1909 that Dr Charles Nicolle (1866 - 1936) working at the Institut Pasteur de Tunis, demonstrated that epidemic typhus was transmitted by a rickettsia carried by the body louse, a finding for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1928. This process of an intermediate carrier, itself not harmed by the pathogenic agent which it transmits, saw a further extension in the field of toxicology. In this latter, it was demonstrated that a poison or toxin could pass along one or more intermediate steps in an ecological food chain, before causing disease in creatures which form the penultimate or final links in such a chain. The most common example of this phenomenon is that of ciguatoxin - whose food-chain passage from invertebrates to lower vertebrates and then to humans is the cause of clinical ciguatera. This food-chain with its intermediate links was first suggested in 1958. This paper is an analysis of the evolution of scientific thought concerning the concept of an "intermediate agent", usually an arthropod, as an essential link in what from 1876 became known as a chain of disease transmission. The word "vector", to describe such an "intermediate agent", was first used (in the Encyclopaedia Britannica) in 1922. One task of medical history is to analyse the causes and perspective of those paradigm shifts which alter knowledge about disease. One such advance was the discovery of the phenomenon of "vectors" - living creatures which themselves are unaffected, but which might transmit pathogenic microorganisms from human victim to victim. Self-evident and taken for granted today, this milestone in the history of medical thinking constituted an advance which occurred over three decades {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century. It was a qualitative concept which extended the former sixteenth century two-stage concept of "contagion" to a three- or multiple-link chain with vector intermediates. That first use in 1876 of the term "intermediate host" and later "vector" referred to arthropods - especially mosquitoes, flies, lice and mites. By the first decade of the twentieth century, it was appreciated that arthropods could transmit viruses, rickettisias, bacteria, protozoans and multi-cellular parasites. This new paradigm of disease pathogenesis came late in the chronology of the history of medicine. This paper is a review of that development of thought concerning "vectors", discoveries which led ultimately to the potential control of a series of diseases which have figured greatly as killing epidemics throughout the chronology of medical history...|$|R

However, many construction workers lack knowledge about these solutions, as well as basic ergonomic principles. Construction apprentices, as they embark on their careers, are greatly in need of ergonomics training to minimize the cumulative exposure that leads to musculoskeletal disorders. Apprentices receive safety training; however, ergonomics training is often limited or non-existent. In addition, apprenticeship programs often lack “soft skills” training on how to appropriately respond to work environments and practices that are unsafe. The SAVE program – SAfety Voice for Ergonomics – strives to integrate evidence-based health and safety training strategies into masonry apprenticeship skills training to teach ergonomics, problem solving, and speaking up to communicate solutions that reduce musculoskeletal injury risk. The central hypothesis is that the combination of ergonomics training and safety voice promotion will be more effective than no training or either ergonomics training alone or safety voice training alone. Methods/design Following the development and pilot testing of the SAVE intervention, SAVE will be evaluated in a cluster-randomized controlled trial at 12 masonry training centers across the U. <b>S.</b> Clusters of <b>apprentices</b> within centers will be assigned at random to one of four intervention groups (n[*]=[*] 24 per group) : (1) ergonomics training only, (2) safety voice training only, (3) combined ergonomics and safety voice training, or (4) control group with no additional training intervention. Outcomes assessed at baseline, at the conclusion of training, and then at six and 12  months post training will include: musculoskeletal symptoms, general health perceptions, knowledge of ergonomic and safety voice principles, and perception and attitudes about ergonomic and safety voice issues. Discussion Masons continue to have a high rate of musculoskeletal disorders. The trade has an expected increase of 40  % in the number of workers by 2020. Therefore, a vetted intervention for apprentices entering the trade, such as SAVE, could reduce the burden of musculoskeletal disorders currently plaguing the trade.

40|$|This volume {{represents}} {{the proceedings of}} a conference held at the Folger Shakespeare Library in 1995. It consists of five parts. In part 1, Meanings of Material London, David Harris Sacks explores the 1601 Essex Rebellion and finds its failure in the primacy that commercial relationships now held over older patron client bonds. Will Kemp s Morris dance from London to Norwich, meanwhile, seemingly illustrates {{the way in which}} market capitalism corrupted civic virtue and traditional hospitality. Derek Keene s richly documented survey of the London economy reinforces the value of a long-term perspective on the capital s growth. The roots of London s consumption patterns can be traced back as far as 1300, and much of its skilled trades and mercantile expertise derived from Continental rather than native sources. Part 2 examines Consumer Culture: Domesticating Foreign Fashion. The title of Joan Thirsk s thoughtful essay England s Provinces: Did They Serve or Drive Material London? is an accurate guide to its content. Existing provincial skills could be exploited to develop new industries or crops catering either to the London market, or to gentry and aristocracy intent on creating islands of metropolitan taste in the provinces. Jane Schneider shows how the accession of James I ushered in a world in glorious technicolor, a welcome relief to the relative drabness of high Elizabethan fashion, and relates this sartorial revolution to familiar changes in England s overseas trade. Color is of concern also to Anne Jones and Peter Stallybrass, who describe the growing popularity of yellow mantles in the early seventeenth century, an enthusiasm that ignored their criminal and, worse, Irish associations. Jean Howard analyses Westward Ho, in order to explore attitudes to foreigners. Ian Archer s rewarding essay Material Londoners? begins part 3 of the volume. He explores the limited extent to which new, acquisitive commercial values conflicted with traditional Christian personal and communal values. This is followed by Gail Paster s examination of that age s peculiar fashion for ever more violent purges and evacuations. Patricia Fumerton contributes an essay notable for its wrongheaded conflation of the experience of vagrancy with that of London <b>s</b> servants and <b>apprentices.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Jered Lawson and Nancy Vail make up {{two thirds}} of the {{founding}} partnership that operates Pie Ranch—“a rural center for urban renewal. ” With San Francisco-based colleague Karen Heisler, Lawson and Vail began establishing this working farm in 2002 as a place where city youth could learn about food. The non-profit organization’s mission, according to its website, is “to inspire and connect rural and urban people to know the source of their food, and to work together to bring greater health to the food system from seed to table. ” Mission Pie, a sister business located in the city’s Mission District and overseen by Heisler, employs local young people in baking and selling pastries concocted from the farm’s products. Perched on a coastal hillside in southern San Mateo County, between Santa Cruz and San Francisco, Pie Ranch’s triangular slice of land now produces “everything you need to make pie”—from pumpkins, berries and tree fruits to eggs, milk, butter, honey and wheat. Students and teachers from urban high schools make monthly farm pilgrimages throughout the school year. Guided by Lawson and Vail and other Pie Ranch staff, they experience hands-on learning about soil, compost, weather, weeds and water; the cycles of planting, tending, and harvesting crops; the challenges and rewards of working as a group, and the pleasures of cooking and eating wholesome food from scratch. Pie Ranch also offers year-long apprenticeships, summer internships, monthly work parties and barn dances, and a variety of educational programs and cultural events. Travelers and locals can sample the farm’s wares at a roadside farm stand downhill from the farm fields, on coastal Route 1 —near the historic Steele dairy lands that Pie Ranch, in cooperation with the Peninsula Open Space Trust (POST), is working to protect. Jered Lawson and Nancy Vail both bring a wealth of experience to the Pie Ranch project. Lawson is a UCSC community studies graduate and a former Apprentice in Ecological Horticulture at the UCSC Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS). Between his first two college years, Lawson spent a formative summer at Stephen and Gloria Decater’s Live Power Community Farm in Covelo (Mendocino County), where Alan Chadwick—Stephen’s mentor at UCSC—had been invited to establish a garden project in 1972. Live Power had recently launched the first community supported agriculture (CSA) program in California. Lawson went on to initiate and oversee a CSA program for Santa Cruz’s Homeless Garden Project, and later did the same for CASFS. Increasingly interested in CSA as a marketing strategy for sustaining small farms, he organized a 1995 Western Region CSA conference and created a statewide CSA advocacy and outreach program campaigns for the Community Alliance with Family Farmers (CAFF). He also helped establish farm-to-school and buy-local programs for CAFF, and did similar work with the Center for Ecoliteracy in Berkeley. Nancy Vail, a graduate of UC San Diego, began learning about farming in a series of post-college internships abroad. Returning to the U. <b>S.,</b> she <b>apprenticed</b> with writer-farmers Eliot Coleman and Barbara Damrosch at Four Season Farm in Harborside, Maine, at Angelic Organics (whose proprietor, John Peterson, was celebrated in the 2006 documentary “The Real Dirt on Farmer John”), and at biodynamic Hawthorne Valley Farm in Columbia County, New York. Like Lawson, Vail also apprenticed in the CASFS program, eventually staying on as a second- and third-year apprentice. She went on to share oversight of the UCSC farm operations with Jim Leap, and managed the CSA that Lawson had inaugurated in 1995. After Vail and Lawson’s first child was born, she moved into a part-time position as farm-to-college program coordinator for CASFS. In early 2008, she left CASFS to attend to childrearing and Pie Ranch full-time. Sarah Rabkin interviewed Jered Lawson on March 4 th, 2008, at Rabkin’s home in Soquel, with a brief follow-up interview in the Science and Engineering Library at UC Santa Cruz on March 18, 2008. Rabkin interviewed Nancy Vail in the same library conference room on March 18, 2008. These interviews covered Lawson’s and Vail’s individual histories prior to the founding of Pie Ranch. On December 11, 2008, at the offices of UCSC’s Program In Community and Agroecology and Community Agroecology Network, she interviewed Lawson and Vail together about the founding and development of Pie Ranch...|$|R
