40|$|Climate {{policy is}} driving an {{extensive}} deployment of wind generation in the Irish electricity market. This study evaluates {{the cost of}} increasing wind generation both to {{the system as a}} whole and to consumers for 2020. We consider different scenarios on fuel and carbon-dioxide permit prices and the extent of <b>electricity</b> <b>interconnection</b> with Great Britain. For a small and isolated electricity system such as Ireland, a high penetration of wind is economically sound only with increased interconnection to Great Britain, since wind generation would otherwise be curtailed. Not surprisingly, for low fuel prices the least-cost scenario contains low levels of wind generation whereas the opposite is true for high fuel prices. The findings highlight the importance of interconnection and its operation and governance. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

In this context, this paper computes the economic additional interconnection capacity between Spain and Central Europe based on the trade-off between transmission capacity cost and RES spillage cost. For this purpose, a model that simulates the hourly operation of the Spanish power system {{for a period of}} one year is used to compute hourly spillage. This analysis covers the period of 2020 - 2050 and includes four scenarios of RES penetration. In addition, a sensitivity analysis in relation to the cost parameters is presented. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

30|$|As {{the future}} lies with Europe, Maghreb region’s {{immediate}} plans are mainly focused on expanding energy trade and transmission lines with Europe. At the same time, the regional integration efforts are intimately {{related to the}} development of renewable energy as Europe has stronger commercial incentives for renewable energy [30, 31]. From Fig.  7, it also shows that after 2010, the amount of electricity export increased as the development of renewable energy. The synchronization with EU power grid shows a decent level of <b>electricity</b> <b>interconnection</b> within the region. However, the cross-regional interconnection with the Eight Countries region is in a low level, which limits the power exchange with this region.

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that a large {{geographic}} spread of installed capacity can reduce wind power variability and smooth production.

However, interconnections and storage are not totally flexible, so {{it is essential to}} understand the wind power correlation in order to address power system constraints in systems with large and growing wind power penetrations. In this study the spatial and temporal correlation of wind power generation across several European Union countries was examined to understand how wind ‘travels’ across Europe. Three years of historical hourly wind power generation data from ten countries were analysed. The results of the analysis were then compared with two other studies focused on the Nordic region and the United States of America. The findings show that similar general correlation characteristics do exist between European country pairs. This is of particular importance when planning and operating interconnector flows, storage optimisation and cross-border power trading...|$|R
40|$|Having a well-adapted {{transmission}} network is key for reaching a sustainable energy system, where generators and consumers {{participate in an}} efficient market. The {{purpose of the present}} research is to estimate the impact on the final prices of the interconnection of the two largest electrical systems in Chile. To this end, an econometric model is used in which prices, among other variables, are explained by the level of marginal costs in the system (opportunity cost), the degree of concentration in the market (market power), and the variability of marginal costs projected by the agents (risk). The data corresponds to bilateral contracts between generators and major clients, from 2006 to 2014. The basic results indicate that the interconnection would benefit final customers by reducing equilibrium contract prices, {{as a result of the}} decreased variability of expected marginal costs and a lower concentration of existing generating companies. This study’s main contribution is to focus on the benefits of <b>electricity</b> <b>interconnection</b> under conditions of competition and risk, instead of using the simple estimation of direct costs, as has traditionally been done...|$|R
40|$|The European Commission {{proposed}} {{to reform the}} Electricity and Gas Directives to improve access to transmission, increase cross-border capacity, and fully open the electricity and gas markets. The California electricity crisis has weakened support for liberalisation, removed the commitment to full market opening, and raised concerns over supply security. Providing adequate reserve capacity is risky in a competitive wholesale electricity market without suitable contracts, and unattractive to oligopolists unless they face a credible entry threat from IPPs. Ending the domestic franchise could remove the counterparty for the contracts required for adequate investment to sustain competitive pricing. Gas liberalisation is key to making electricity markets contestable and reducing pressures on scarce <b>electricity</b> <b>interconnection</b> capacity. Environmental concerns increase uncertainty and further deter entry, while raising other policy issues {{that need to be}} addressed. Compared to the US, much of the EU lacks the necessary legislative and regulatory power to mitigate generator market power. Unless markets are made more contestable, transmission capacity expanded and adequate generation capacity ensured, liberalisation may lead to higher prices.

40|$|Due to {{historical}} and geographical reasons, the Baltic States are strongly interconnected to power transmission grids of Russia and Belarus. Current energy security policies and <b>electricity</b> <b>interconnection</b> {{targets in the}} EU trigger the need for studying and implementing alternative electricity supply options and power system configuration schemes for the Baltic countries. In order to provide a supporting analysis for the energy policy making, with a special focus on electricity, a framework with methodologies is proposed in this paper to assess the electricity independence of the Baltic States. To comprehensively assess the electricity independence, we provided three indices: ‘‘adequacy’’, ‘‘security’’ and ‘‘economic factor’’. The proposed framework and methodologies are applied for assessing the electricity independence of the Baltic States in the present (2014) and future scenarios: mid-term (2020), and long-term (2030) time frame. The analysis {{results show that the}} planned generation capacities are adequate to cover future electricity demand in the Baltic States in 2020 and 2030.

40|$|Thermostatically {{controlled}} electrical loads {{can provide}} valuable energy storage and are prime candidates for fast acting demand response (DR) {{that can be}} used to mitigate highly variable renewable power generation and limited availability of ramping resources. When conventional thermostats are retrofitted for real-time price DR control, significant control errors can arise, particularly in the form of dispatch control drift. This paper identifies the underlying causes and presents a new residential thermostat design that enables accurate aggregate load control. The new design gives rise to linear time-invariant models of aggregate load control and demand response, which facilitate the design of highly accurate load-based regulation services for <b>electricity</b> <b>interconnections.</b> Detailed simulation and performance studies coupling a residential house and feeder models are presented to show how consumer comfort and cost savings are achieved and how energy use is impacted for cities in three different climatic zones. During peak times, the new thermostat imparts the entire residential load an energy demand elasticity of about 10 % to 25 %. Larger demand elasticities could be achieved by extending the control strategy to other residential thermostatic loads.
