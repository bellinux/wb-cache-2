5|$|Despite its later {{importance}} to Britain, Gibraltar was initially {{seen by the}} British Government {{as more of a}} bargaining counter than a strategic asset.

On seven separate occasions between 1713 and 1728 the British Government proposed to exchange Gibraltar for concessions from Spain, but on each occasion the proposals were vetoed by the British Parliament following public protests.|$|E

5|$|Some {{reforms were}} {{being pursued by}} the more enlightened szlachta, who wanted to expand {{the role of the}} Sejm at the monarch's and magnate faction's <b>expense,</b> <b>and</b> by the elected kings.

The increased efforts in the areas of taxation and maintenance of the military forces made possible the positive outcomes of some of the armed conflicts that took place during Sigismund's reign.|$|E
50|$|Another {{distinction}} is between net and gross return. The 'pure' net {{return to the}} investor is the return net of all fees, <b>expenses,</b> <b>and</b> taxes, whereas the 'pure' gross return is the return before all fees, <b>expenses,</b> <b>and</b> taxes. Various variations between these two extremes exist. Which return one looks at depends on what one is trying to measure. For example, if one wishes to measure the ability of an investment manager to add value, then the return net of transaction expenses, but gross of all other fees, <b>expenses,</b> <b>and</b> taxes is an appropriate measure to look at since fees, <b>expenses,</b> <b>and</b> taxes other than transaction expenses are often outside {{the control of the}} investment manager.|$|R

5|$|Wagner's role at Ludwig's court became controversial; in particular, Ludwig's {{habit of}} {{referring}} Wagner's policy ideas to his ministers alarmed the court. When Wagner demanded the sacking both of Ludwig's cabinet secretary {{and of his}} prime minister, there was a public outcry, and in December 1865 Ludwig reluctantly told Wagner to leave Bavaria. The king did not, however, withdraw his patronage or financial support. After a few months' wandering, in March 1866 Wagner arrived in Geneva, where Cosima joined him. They travelled together to Lucerne where they found a large lakeside house, the Villa Tribschen. Wagner made immediate arrangements to rent the house, at the king's <b>expense,</b> <b>and</b> by 15 April was installed in his new home.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} <b>expenses</b> <b>and</b> {{proceeds}} in manufacturing textile industry company {{and focuses on}} their measurement and effects on the operating result. We can not effectively and economically manage the production process of the company without previous knowledge {{of the structure of}} <b>expenses</b> <b>and</b> proceeds. It is necessary to regulate the accounting system and monitor the relationship between <b>expenses</b> <b>and</b> proceeds. These problems will be solved by the change of the system of the accounting documents´ circulation which is able to self-control the relationship between <b>expenses</b> <b>and</b> proceeds, and furthermore by the regulation of the suitable costing system of the company. The thesis results from the practical observation of the relationship between <b>expenses</b> <b>and</b> proceeds, their effect on the operating result in conditions of the manufacturing company. The applied arrangements will be analysed for drawing conclusions and recommendations for the next economic development of the company. The result of the thesis is the influence quantification of the change of the accounting documents´ circulation system. Productivity of labour was demonstrably higher due to more effective observation of the relationship between <b>expenses</b> <b>and</b> proceeds. The costing method "ABC" evaluated two fundamental types of the manufacture in term of general <b>expenses</b> <b>and</b> formation of the operating result, and the manufacture with higher profits was marked. These conclusions build the theoretical principle for the future decisions about the manufacturing programme of the company. The recommendations, which are included in the thesis, do not consider the possibility of the volume increase of the production because of the unsuitable economic conditions. The current number of employees will remain the same, and the reduction of the production owing to external economic aspects in the region is possible. The thesis offers the basic orientation {{in the structure of the}} <b>expenses</b> <b>and</b> proceeds of the company, and the recommendations for the increase of the production effectivity. It offers the control possibilities of <b>expenses,</b> <b>and</b> costing methods of general expenses...|$|R

5|$|Alkanes and aryl alkanes may be {{chlorinated}} under {{free radical}} conditions, with UV light. However, {{the extent of}} chlorination is difficult to control: the reaction is not regioselective and often results {{in a mixture of}} various isomers with different degrees of chlorination, though this may be permissible if the products are easily separated. Aryl chlorides may be prepared by the Friedel-Crafts halogenation, using chlorine and a Lewis acid catalyst. The haloform reaction, using chlorine and sodium hydroxide, is also able to generate alkyl halides from methyl ketones, and related compounds. Chlorine adds to the multiple bonds on alkenes and alkynes as well, giving di- or tetra-chloro compounds. However, due to the <b>expense</b> <b>and</b> reactivity of chlorine, organochlorine compounds are more commonly produced by using hydrogen chloride, or with chlorinating agents such as phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) or thionyl chloride (SOCl2). The last is very convenient in the laboratory because all side products are gaseous and {{do not have to be}} distilled out.|$|E
5|$|At age sixteen, Stone began {{teaching}} in district schools, as her brothers and sister, Rhoda, also did. Her beginning pay of $1.00 a day was {{much lower than}} that of male teachers, and when she substituted for her brother, Bowman, one winter, she received less pay than he received. When she protested to the school committee that she had taught all the subjects Bowman had, it replied that they could give her “only a woman’s pay.” Lower pay for women was one of the arguments cited by those promoting the hiring of women as teachers: “To make education universal, it must be at moderate <b>expense,</b> <b>and</b> women can afford to teach for one-half, or even less, the salary which men would ask.” Although Stone’s salary increased along with the size of her schools, until she finally received $16 a month, it was always lower than the male rate.|$|E

In wartime, the government could commandeer and retrofit Collins's steamboats as warships, but Breckinridge cited Commodore Matthew C. Perry's opinion {{that they would be}} useless in war. Finally, he showed Cornelius Vanderbilt's written statement promising to build a fleet of mail ships at his <b>expense</b> <b>and</b> carry the mail for $4 million less than Collins.

5|$|By {{the start}} of the 20th century it was clear that Gibraltar could be bombarded with {{relative}} impunity from the Spanish mainland. Proposals were put forward to build a new harbour {{on the east side of}} the Rock, where ships would be less vulnerable to direct artillery fire from the mainland, but were abandoned due to the vast <b>expense</b> <b>and</b> only marginal gains in security. A new round of tunnelling was carried out to provide more bombproof accommodation for the garrison, along with deep shelters and casemates capable of accommodating 2,000 men. Ultimately it was decided in 1906 that Gibraltar faced no credible threat from land and that the defences would be organised to deal with a threat from the sea.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1170s Henry focused {{on trying to}} create a stable system of government, {{increasingly}} ruling through his family, but tensions over the succession arrangements were never far away, ultimately leading to a fresh revolt. Having quelled the left-over rebels from the Great Revolt, Richard was recognised by Henry as the Duke of Aquitaine in 1179. In 1181 Geoffrey finally married Constance and became Duke of Brittany; by now most of Brittany accepted Angevin rule, and Geoffrey was able to deal with the remaining disturbances on his own. John had spent the Great Revolt travelling alongside his father and most observers now began to regard the prince as Henry's favourite child. Henry began to grant John more lands, mostly at various nobles' <b>expense,</b> <b>and</b> in 1177 made him the Lord of Ireland. Meanwhile, Young Henry spent {{the end of the decade}} travelling in Europe, taking part in tournaments and playing only a passing role in either government or Henry and Richard's military campaigns; he was increasingly dissatisfied with his position and lack of power.|$|E
5|$|It {{culminated in}} a period during 1937 when all the powers where {{prepared}} {{to give up on}} non-intervention. Ciano complained to his government that Italian forces in Italy were ready but not being used; the Soviet Union was not prepared to discuss belligerent rights; Delbos was considering proposing mediation by Roosevelt and the Pope, whilst simultaneously preparing French war plans; Britain's new Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, saw securing a friendship with the Italian Benito Mussolini as a top priority. Eden confided he wished Franco to win, so Italian and Germany involvement would be scaled back; Chamberlain considered Spain a troublesome complication to be forgotten. By the end of July 1937, the Committee was in deadlock, and the aims of a successful outcome to the Spanish Civil War was looking unlikely. Unrestricted Italian submarine warfare began on 12 August. The British Admiralty believed that a significant control effort was the best solution, of four which were put forward, in response to attacks on British shipping. On 27 August it was decided by the Committee that naval patrols did not justify their <b>expense</b> <b>and</b> would be replaced, as planned, with observers at ports.|$|E
40|$|This study {{tests the}} impact of {{diversification}} strategies on the cash flows, <b>expenses,</b> risks <b>and</b> returns of REITs in Asia. Hirschman-Herfindahl indices (HHI) are computed based on 2281 properties owned by 63 sample Asian REITs for the periods from 2002 to 2007 to measure the levels of diversification by property type and geographical region. In our empirical tests that use weighted least square regressions, we find no significant effects of diversification by property types on cash flows, <b>expenses</b> <b>and</b> risk premiums of Asian REITs. However, significant variations in <b>expenses</b> <b>and</b> risk premiums of the REITs are explained by a geographical diversification strategy. REITs with assets distributed across different countries incur higher total expenses, interest <b>expenses,</b> general <b>and</b> administrative <b>expenses</b> <b>and</b> capital expenditure. Regionally diversified REITs have higher risk premiums. The results remain unchanged after controlling for country factor and simultaneity between the cash flows, <b>expenses,</b> risk <b>and</b> return variables.
