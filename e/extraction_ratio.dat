40|$|PURPOSE: Increased {{blood-brain barrier}} {{permeability}} (BBBP) {{can result from}} ischemia. In this study the relation between stroke severity, patient characteristics and admission BBBP values measured with CT-perfusion (CTP) was investigated in acute ischemic stroke patients. METHODS: From prospective data of the Dutch Acute Stroke Study 149 patients with a middle cerebral artery stroke and extended CTP were selected. BBBP values were measured in the penumbra and infarct core as defined by CTP thresholds, and in the contra-lateral hemisphere. The relation between stroke (severity) variables and patient characteristics, including early CT signs, dense vessel sign (DVS), time to scan and National Institute of Health Stroke Score (NIHSS), and BBBP parameters in penumbra and infarct core was quantified with regression analysis. RESULTS: Early CT signs were related to higher BBBP values in the infarct core (B = 0. 710), higher ipsi- to contra-lateral BBBP ratios (B = 0. 326) and higher <b>extraction</b> <b>ratios</b> in the infarct core (B = 16. 938).

50|$|The low-flow-rate {{method is}} {{based on the fact that}} the {{extraction}} efficiency is dependent on the flow-rate.

This concept is applied for the (low-)flow-rate method, where the probe is perfused with blank perfusate at different flow-rates. Concentration at the sampling site can be determined by plotting the <b>extraction</b> <b>ratios</b> against the corresponding flow-rates and extrapolating to zero-flow.
