The ductility criteria and performance of low-ductility steels for cold-formed members and connections have been studied by Dhalla, Winter, and Errera at Cornell University. It was found that the ductility measurement in a standard tension test includes local ductility and uniform ductility. Local ductility is designated as the localized <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> the eventual <b>fracture</b> zone.

From this range of morphologies, quite similar phase structures can be selected differing only in AN-content of the SAN blend components.

To achieve this, two different hydrogels with opposite topologies were designed on the basis of grafted architectures using equal amounts of water-soluble chains (poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) = PDMA) and LCST polymer chains (poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) = PNIPA). By working under isochoric conditions, with almost 85 wt % of water in the whole temperature range (20 – 60 °C), we were able to clearly highlight the impact of the phase transition of PNIPA on the mechanical reinforcement of the gel without any interference of the volume transition. These graft hydrogels, designed with PNIPA in the backbone (GPN-D) or as pendant chains (GPD-N), have been studied more specifically by tensile tests and 2 D neutron scattering at rest and under deformation. From these complementary techniques, we show that PNIPA side-chains in GPD-N self-assemble above their transition temperature into a micellar network greatly interfering with the covalent PDMA frame. While the elastic modulus increases reversibly more than ten times throughout the phase transition, other properties like <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> break and <b>fracture</b> resistance are greatly enhanced with temperature. At high temperature and under extension, SANS data highlight the affine deformation of PNIPA domains.
