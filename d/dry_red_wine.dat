5|$|As the {{traditional}} method of making borscht with beet sour often requires planning {{at least several}} days ahead, many recipes for quicker borscht replace the beet sour with fresh beetroot juice, while the sour taste is imparted by other ingredients, such as vinegar, lemon juice or citric acid, tomatoes, tart apples, <b>dry</b> <b>red</b> <b>wine,</b> dill pickle juice, sauerkraut juice, or a fermented rye flour and water mixture. The soup is typically flavored with {{a wide selection of}} herbs, spices and condiments. Salt, black pepper, garlic, bay leaves and dill are among the most commonly used. Other aromatics often added to borscht include allspice, celery stalks, parsley, marjoram, hot peppers, saffron, horseradish, ginger and prunes. Some recipes require flour or roux to further thicken the borscht. A common opinion is that a good borscht should be thick enough for a spoon to stand upright in it.|$|E
500|$|As well as {{the thick}} borschts {{described}} above, Polish cuisine offers a ruby-colored beetroot bouillon known as , or clear red borscht. It is made by combining strained meat-and-vegetable stock with wild mushroom broth and beet sour. In some versions, smoked meat {{may be used for}} the stock and the tartness may be obtained or enhanced by adding lemon juice, dill pickle brine, or <b>dry</b> <b>red</b> <b>wine.</b> It may be served either in a soup bowl or – especially at dinner parties – as a hot beverage in a twin-handled cup, with a croquette or a filled pastry on the side. Unlike other types of borscht, it is not whitened with sour cream. , or Christmas Eve borscht, is a variant of the clear borscht that is traditionally served during the Polish Christmas Eve supper. In this version, meat stock is either omitted or replaced with fish broth, usually made by boiling the heads cut off from fish used in other Christmas Eve dishes. The mushrooms used for cooking the mushroom broth are reserved for [...] (small filled dumplings), which are then served with the borscht.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{spectral}} fingerprint to discriminate different <b>dry</b> <b>red</b> <b>wines</b> was built using data visualization method. Twelve <b>red</b> <b>wines</b> with different vintages, cultivars and ageing methods from Changli and Shacheng were sampled. Nine fractions of each wine were collected with a reversed-phase C 18 column, {{and then they}} were lyophilized. The residue of each fraction was resolved with synthetic wine of the same volume with the fraction sample. The transmittance spectra of wines and their fractions were recorded from 190 to 1100 nm. And the spectral data were visualized to show their visual differences directly. Mono-phenols in wine and fractions were analyzed by HPLC-DAD at wavelengths in the range where located the obvious differences of the {{spectral fingerprint}}s. The results showed that the spectral differences of wine samples lied in the range of 190 to 600 nm. There were obvious differences in visual maps among wines with different vintages, mainly around 520 nm. The visualization differences among wines with distinct geographical origins lay in the F 8 maps, and the differences from the aging methods almost cover the whole wavelength range visualized. However, wines from different grape cultivars had the similar visual characteristics. HPLC-DAD identified the possible mono-phenol groups for the spectral differences at 280, 313, 365 and 520 nm. It was concluded that the visualization of spectral data from 190 to 600 nm could be used to build <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> spectral fingerprint to distinguish <b>dry</b> <b>red</b> <b>wines</b> with different vintages, origins, and ageing methods.

40|$|Background Better {{knowledge}} of wine composition, especially that of anthocyanin-derived pigments, has helped improve wine quality over the years. The use of micro-oxygenation (MOX), which consists in adding low quantities of oxygen {{at different stages}} of the winemaking process, contributes to enhancing and stabilizing wine color through the formation of stable pigments called pyranoanthocyanins, while the cycloaddition of anthocyanins requires an oxidation step. Scope and approach This review describes the formation kinetics and the evolution of the concentrations of the various groups of pyranoanthocyanins. Both non-oxygenated and oxygenated varietal <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> samples are compared {{in order to determine the}} impact of MOX on pyranoanthocyanin contents. Key findings and conclusions During alcoholic fermentation, the concentration of vitisin A increases due to the availability of pyruvic acid and progressively decreases with aging. Higher contents are found in Port <b>red</b> <b>wines.</b> MOX can enhance the concentrations in <b>dry</b> <b>red</b> <b>wines</b> but the contents remain lower than those found in Port wines. The formation of vitisin B can be promoted by the oxidation of ethanol in acetaldehyde but the results depend on the varietal <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> used. Flavanol-pyranoanthocyanin contents also vary according to wine age, with a reported decreasing concentration during aging for Port and <b>dry</b> <b>red</b> <b>wines.</b> After MOX treatment, their concentrations increase with a more acidic pH and a higher oxygen rate. The increase of the content in pyranoanthocyanins after two years of ageing contributes to stabilize wine colour. Further studies will determine the impact of oxygen on phenyl-pyranoanthocyanins since data are still scarce on the subject...|$|R

As the must macerated with the skins, the intense heat of the process would often kill the yeast resulting in a stuck fermentation and residual sugar in the remaining wine.
