40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between <b>information</b> uncertainty and <b>auditor</b> reputation revealed {{by the failure of}} Arthur Andersen (AA). AA's reputation deteriorated considerably when it announced on January 10, 2002, that it had shredded documents related to its audit of Enron. AA's demise was sealed on March 14, 2002, with its indictment for obstruction of justice. We find that on these dates the clients of AA and other Big Five auditors that are characterized by higher information uncertainty experience relatively larger share price declines compared to clients with lower information uncertainty. The findings suggest that the market relies more heavily on auditor reputation for higher information uncertainty firms, which implies that the value of an audit is greater when a firm is harder to value. Our results highlight the importance of information uncertainty in financial markets: where there is a shock to auditor reputation, firms with greater information uncertainty suffer the largest losses. <b>Information</b> uncertainty <b>Auditor</b> reputation Contagion Arthur Andersen...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} an attempt to {{investigate}} empirically the suitability of the international accounting standards (IASs) to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) environment. A variety of parametric and nonparametric approaches were used to examine the underlying factors that could affect the level of adoption of IASs and to evaluate the suitability of such adoption to the UAE environment. The major finding {{of this study is that}} the companies examined have vigorously adopted IASs and 87 percent of the companies disclosed their financial information in the English language which can be considered as a robust factor for adopting IASs. This study finds that the size of the companies (as measured by total assets) in the UAE has a significant effect on the level of adoption of IASs. However, the type of sector and the trading status (listed or unlisted) have no significant effect on the level of adoption of IASs. This study also tests to determine if a general consensus exists between the user groups of financial <b>information</b> (<b>auditors,</b> brokers, finance managers, and financial analysts) regarding their perception of the adoption of IASs in the UAE. It is found that there is a general consensus among the user groups on the suitability of adoption of IASs in the UAE.

40|$|Thesis (MTech. {{degree in}} Business Information Systems) [...] Tshwane University of Technology 2011. Information systems {{are defined as}} a group of {{interconnected}} components (people, organisation and technology) that function together to extract, regain, route, accumulate and distribute information, with the aim of business decision making and operational activities in an organisation and other business. As a result, nformation systems are being deployed by organisation to help assure that their daily activities are completed seamlessly. Thus, organisational stakeholders invest a vast amount of money in the deployment of these systems. Furthermore, volumes of organisational data stored within these systems increases on regular basis. As the volume of data and the complexity of information systems increase, business managers expect <b>information</b> systems <b>auditors</b> to become even more relevant and rigorous as these auditors have to ensure that possible risks that these nformation systems may inherent are mitigated. International Auditing standards and best practices emphasise the use of Computer Aided Audit Techniques by IS auditors, within their audit engagements. However, the level of compliance to these international auditing standards and best practices by the South African <b>information</b> systems <b>auditors</b> is still questionable. An empirical study conducted by Vasile-Daniel (2010) indicated that even if technology is accepted, few (if not all) of nformation systems auditors still deploy traditional audit methods within their audit engagements. Currently, auditors were observed to use Computer Aided Audit Techniques only to select random test samples but not necessarily to audit entirely using Computer Aided Audit Techniques. That is, they often revert to executing their audit engagements following the traditional methods. To the preceding point, the present study sought to explore factors that could be influencing the nformation systems auditors not to utilize Computer Aided Audit Techniques fully. The study, underpinned by the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), investigated the use or adoption of Computer Aided Audit Techniques by <b>information</b> systems <b>auditors</b> within a financial institution. The study revealed that senior management support, availability of resources, personal growth, increased productivity, and lack of relevant training tend to be the main factors, amongst others, influencing the use and adoption of Computer Aided Audit Techniques...|$|R

50|$|Further to {{regulations}} {{regarding the}} appointment of auditors the various Companies Acts also contain rules regarding the rights of auditors. The most fundamental of these regulations is section 389A of the Companies Act 1985.

Section 389A also covers other matters such as making it illegal for employees of a company to make misleading, false or deceptive statements to auditors regarding any accounting related queries they may have. Subsidiaries of British companies also must provide any accounting related <b>information</b> to the <b>auditor</b> of the parent company should they request it although in general it is usually the same auditor who undertakes the audit of both the parent company and its subsidiaries. Section 389A finally goes on to state that companies must take all reasonable steps to obtain accounting related <b>information</b> for <b>auditors</b> from any overseas subsidiaries it may have.

40|$|The {{turnover}} rate of <b>Information</b> Systems <b>auditors</b> is an emerging {{problem for the}} profession. In his study of factors affecting resource allocations to Information Systems Audit departments, Lucy [Lucy, R. F. Factors affecting information systems audit resource allocation decisions.

Farewell to the information systems audit profession. Internal Auditor 1989; February: 42 – 48. ] argues that this high turnover of IS auditors will limit systems audit knowledge. Unlike prior research investigating turnover intentions of IS auditors, this study specifically includes factors that reflect the higher level needs of IS audit professionals. The need to satisfy personal and professional growth exerts a particularly strong influence on IS auditors 2 ̆ 7 turnover intentions. Further, our study confirms that IS auditors 2 ̆ 7 share similar characteristics to other IS professionals rather than with general accountants and auditors.

40|$|Purpose: The paper aims {{to explore}} whether {{intangible}} items that recognised in financial statements are value-relevant to {{investors in the}} French context, and whether these items affect the value relevance of accounting information. Design/methodology/approach: Empirical {{data were collected from}} a sample of French listed companies, over the nine-year period of 2005 to 2013. Starting of Ohlson’s (1995) model, the correlation analysis and the linear multiple regressions have been applied. Findings: We find that intangibles and traditional accounting measures as a whole are value relevant. However, the amortization and impairment charges of intangibles and cash flows do not affect the market values of French companies, unlike other variables, which affect positively and substantially the market values. Also goodwill and book values are more associated with market values than intangible assets and earnings respectively. Finally, we find that intangibles have improved the value relevance of accounting information. Practical implications: French legislators must give more interest for intangibles, in order to enrich the financial statements content and increasing the pertinence of accounting <b>information.</b> <b>Auditors</b> must give more attention for intangibles’ examination process, in order to certify the amounts related to intangibles in financial statements, and hence enrich their reliability, what provides adequacy guarantees for investors to use them in decision making. Originality/value: The paper used recently available financial data, and proposed an improvement concerning the measure of incremental value relevance of intangibles items. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
