40|$|Session 5 - Stream 3 The social {{assistance}} programme of China (dibao) or Minimum Living Standard Guarantee System (MLSG) was introduced in urban China since 1993 in Shanghai and was gradually extended to cover all Chinese urban areas in 1998. Since 2007, the system basically covered all rural areas as well. In 2009, there was 70. 9 million persons (58. 4 million in 2007) benefiting from di bao, or 5. 3 % (4. 4 % in 2007) of the total population. This comprised of 3. 8 % (the same in 2007) of the urban population and 6. 7 % (4. 9 % in 2007) of the rural population respectively. The total expenditure was about 0. 24 % of the GDP in 2009 (0. 15 % in 2007). By the end of 2007, older people constituted about 13. 1 %, and adults constituted 62. 9 % of the recipients all over China. Like many other countries, di bao is also a gateway to some <b>essential</b> <b>social</b> <b>services,</b> such as housing, health care, and education, which are still inadequately provided for many low-income households. Since informal employment is very common among low-income groups in China, the sources of income are difficult to establish. Given this background, dibao is treated as an additional source of income, and gateway to <b>social</b> <b>services</b> for low-income households working in the informal sector. The incentive and opportunities to leave dibao for low-income households is limited. Shanghai {{is one of the}} most affluent regions in China, 88. 7 % of its population were urban citizen in 2007. A lower percentage of its residents were on dibao (2. 5 % comparing to 4. 4 % of the national figure in 2007). However, 84 % of its recipients were working age adults. We have conducted a longitudinal qualitative approach to study 40 dibao families with adults of working age in a district in Shanghai. We have interviewed twice over a period of 12 months to see how they manage their employment and income and negotiate with the dibao system.

40|$|Abstract This thesis {{argues that}} poverty {{alleviation}} strategies and programs {{carried out by}} the government and Non Governmental Organizations in Ghana provide affirmative solutions to poverty. This is because, these intervention strategies have been influenced by conventional discourses on poverty that fail to adequately address non-economic issues of poverty such as powerlessness, marginalization and tmder-representation. The study is carried out in a two-pronged manner; first, it analyses state policies and strategies, particularly the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS), on poverty alleviation and compares these to NGO programs, implemented with funds and support from external donor organizations. Specifically, I focus on how NGOs and the governnlent of Ghana negotiate autonomy and financial dependency with their funding donor-partners and how these affect their policies and programs. Findings from this study reveal that while external influences dominate poverty alleviation policies and strategies, NGOs and the government of Ghana exercise varying degrees of agency in navigating these issues. In particular, NGOs have been able to adapt their programs to the changing needs of donor markets, and are also actively engaged in re-orienting poverty back to the political domain through advocacy campaigns. Overall, rural communities in Ghana depend on charitable NGOs for the provision of <b>essential</b> <b>social</b> <b>services,</b> while the Ghanaian government depends on international donor assistance for its development projects...|$|R

40|$|In some post-communist cities, the {{formation}} of informal settlements is a phenomenon associated with the wave of urbanisation of the 1960 s and 1970 s. In others, the phenomenon is connected with the influx of immigrants and refugees in the 1990 s. Informal settlement areas {{are the result of}} various factors: inadequate spatial planning, outdated and complex legislation, housing policies that do not ensure the provision of affordable housing and outdated public administration structures. Illegal construction practices in urban areas, often {{due to the lack of}} a clear system of property rights and urban poverty, have created significant challenges in many cities such as Tirana, Belgrade, Tbilisi and Bucharest. This paper presents a typology of informal settlements in post-communist cities and discusses the interrelated economic, social and environmental challenges associated with this phenomenon.

40|$|This {{background}} paper for the World Bank’s World Development Report 2011 discusses current financing arrangements for postconflict countries and fragile states, {{with a focus}} on official development assistance. In recent years a consensus has emerged that in these “difficult environments ” the core objective is to build effective and legitimate governance structures that secure public confidence through provision of personal security, equal justice and the rule of law, economic well-being, and <b>essential</b> <b>social</b> <b>services</b> including education and health. Yet tensions persist between business-as-usual development policies {{on the one hand and}} policies responsive to the demands of peacebuilding on the other. The preferential allocation of aid to “good performers, ” in the name of maximizing its payoff in terms of economic growth, militates against aid to fragile and conflictaffected states. Compelling arguments can be made for assistance to “poor performers ” if this can help to prevent conflict and build peace, but the difficulties that prompted donors to become more selective in aid allocation remain all too real. The move to selectivity came in response to evidence that in some contexts aid has perverse effects on economic performance. The same dilemma arises when aid is assessed in terms of its impact on peace and conflict: sometimes aid helps to prevent conflict and build peace, but sometimes it can have the opposite effect.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research paper is to elaborate on issues surrounding coope-ration between families with children with disabilities and social workers who provide them with relevant <b>social</b> <b>services.</b> Family represents a core aspect of nurture, and is irreplaceable in the overall child's welfare. It today's society the families are also supported by qualified social workers who help with care for disabled children. There is variety of rehabilitation programs available with qualified professionals providing services that encompass medical, social, and educational qualities.

The goal of this paper is to identify the role of institutions and social workers aiding families with children with disabilities. The research includes organizations whose <b>social</b> <b>services</b> are primarily focused on assisting families with disabled children. Qualitative research was performed to support the empirical portion of this paper. Coll-ection of data was accomplished by interrogations with structured discussions. The examined sample included ten <b>social</b> workers providing <b>services</b> to families with chil-dren with disabilities.

A secondary question was posed as follows: How does a fa-mily manage disabled child's welfare in instances where social institutions and workers are not relied upon? The conclusion of the research established that the social workers mainly function as a support system for families with children with disabilities. Social institutions and workers mainly assist to such families with difficult social aspects, providing direction, and laying out options for child's development. However, the key effort lies within the family itself. Additionally, the study established that utilizing of the social workers by the families is advantageous.

The two-stage least square regression results show that growth in composite welfare indicators, literacy, household size and number of trained youth significantly reduced poverty incidences (p< 0. 10), while unemployment rate, number of robbery cases and annual allocation from the federation accounts significantly increased it.

Although {{it is evident that}} the number of persons born with or acquire hearing impairments in later stages of their lives is increasing in many developing countries, there is limited research on this population. The main objective {{of this article is to}} explore the identities and experiences of living as a person who is deaf in Uganda. Using data from semi-structured interviews with 42 deaf persons (aged 19 – 41) and three focus group discussions, the study findings show that beneath the more pragmatic identities documented in the United States and European discourses there is a matrix of ambiguous, often competing and manifold forms in Uganda that are not necessarily based on the deaf and deaf constructions. The results further show that the country’s cultural, religious and ethnic diversity is more of a restraint than an enabler to the aspirations of the deaf community. The study concludes that researchers and policy makers need to be cognisant of the unique issues underlying deaf epistemologies whilst implementing policy and programme initiatives that directly affect them. The upper case ‘D’ in the term deaf is a convention that has been used since the early 1970 s to connote a ‘socially constructed visual culture’ or a linguistic, social and cultural minority group who use sign language as primary means of communication and identify with the deaf community, whereas the lower case ‘d’ in deaf refers to ‘the audio logical condition of hearing impairment’.

[No title page] This study {{underscores the}} need to tackle the escalating HIV /AIDS pandemic in Zimbabwe through a developmental and human rights based approach. In particular it focuses on second generation rights because of their emphasis on the social welfare of individuals. Second generation rights relate to the living conditions of people in society, attempting to ensure that individuals have adequate standard of living. This is achieved through the provision of adequate food, clothing, income, housing, medical care and other <b>essential</b> <b>social</b> <b>services.</b> While acknowledging that behaviour change is an essential element in fighting HIV/AIDS since the virus is spread mostly through sexual contact, the study recognises {{that it is of}} limited effect if factors that constrain the ability of individuals to alter their behaviour are not addressed. The study thus recommends the upholding of second-generation rights as an effective compliment to behaviour change strategies. Without mechanisms that facilitate change and build a conducive environment for such a transformation, the HIV/AIDS pandemic will continue to rage on. The research is a qualitative study conducted with a single case study. Zimbabwe is used as a case study as it provides a unique example of a country that has managed to lower its HIV/AIDS prevalence. However, it is now faced with an overwhelming challenge of increasing or at least sustaining this downward trend of the epidemic. Unfortunately, due to an economic and political melt-down the country is suffering a serious humanitarian crisis that has impoverished the community, encouraging risky sexual coping strategies and severely undermined the countries health delivery system, all which work to threaten the success achieved so far in the battle against HIV/AIDS...|$|R

40|$|For {{about three}} decades now the world’s {{economic}} systems have mainly embraced a neoliberal paradigm. The precept of this paradigm is, more egocentric than the capitalist philosophy of homo economicus, {{that it is}} not enough to have the market determine all human or institutional relations, but that there should be nothing which is not the market. Neoliberalism would see surrendered to the market to be commodified all the services communally provided for its citizens by the state, such as healthcare and education. Neoliberalism and its many approaches mount formidable pressure on states to fall to its sway. The environment created by neoliberalism is a challenge to states, like Sweden, that still believe in the central provision of <b>essential</b> <b>social</b> <b>services</b> so that the enjoyment of such services would not depend on the economic status of the individual citizen, because in the long run the state would benefit from having it so. This research studied, given this environment, whether the provision of higher education in the welfare state of Sweden could be commodified. An extensive review of relevant literature was done to define the problem and establish a theoretical frame. From there a questionnaire was designed and administered to Swedish universities. The responses were used to formulate questions for semi-structured interviews with parliamentarians and university vice-chancellors. The research found, among other things, a transformation from an inward-looking system to one of increasing globalisation; from detailed state planning and control to a broad degree of freedoms to act. There is a lack of desire for universities to be fully independent of the state; a desire for broadened entrepreneurialism, especially in the areas of conversion of research results into products and co-operation with the private sector. There are statutes that hinder some entrepreneurial activities or limit the universities’ ability to make money from them; a vehement stand against the commodification of higher education for natives, but qualified openness for some categories of foreign students paying for their education in the country. There is diminished solidarity-thinking and the use of global educational contacts as a means to support the country’s export sector. There is no indication that the possibility exists in the foreseeable future for higher education in Sweden to move from the sphere of public good to private good since an overwhelming majority of those most closely associated with legislation, policy formulation and execution are against the commodification of higher education...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{growing number}} of mobile devices and {{applications}} creates huge opportunities for different users and use contexts to employ a range of <b>essential</b> <b>social</b> and economic <b>services.</b> Mobile health (m-health) applications for developing countries seek to improve access to healthcare and health-related information, especially {{in the rural areas}} with limited resources. Various healthcare initiatives have been undertaken, both from the governmental and non-governmental organizations, including the Mobile Based Vaccine Stock Monitoring System for rural parts of Ethiopia for timely intervention of out-of-stock and wastage of vaccines. This paper focuses on a pilot program of mobile user interface usability research, seeking to extract claims about mobile interface development and to support and refute claims extracted from literature with the actual user interface design claims examined from the case study. Resulting from this research are different issues and challenges of user interface design, explained both from the designer and user perspective for developing countries...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} study attempts to quantify and examine how changes in Population dynamics affect household portfolio choices (expenditure on food, monetary transactions, {{goods and services}} and non-cash expenditure) in Nigeria {{given the fact that}} Nigeria is going through a demographic transition. Previous efforts to assess impacts of Population growth have ignored the household expenditure responses, which has been far from being definitive on the transmission net effects on household portfolio choices. This study focuses on Nigeria with the aim of overcoming these defects and obtaining reliable information. The study establishes a link between demographic variables and household expenditure components using the Vector Error Correction Methodology. Next, the estimated equations are used to project the pattern of the different components of expenditure income based on three population scenarios generated from different assumptions on changes in fertility. Nonetheless, several counterfactual simulations were examined to enhance our understanding of the effects of Population dynamics on contingent choices. The results suggest that population dynamics in Nigeria can produce significant effects on the economy via the expenditure profiles of households. The results also suggest that other factors such as real per capita income, ratio of other expenditure categories to total expenditure influence growth of household expenditure components. The results of the study have some important implications for policy: • Pursuit of prudent macroeconomic policy has significant payoffs, as it avoids further constraints on household’s provision of <b>essential</b> <b>social</b> <b>services,</b> such as health services; • The rate of urbanization in Nigeria affects many categories of household expenditure, and therefore government policy of directing policies that would improve household expenditure on monetary transactions is likely to have significant payoffs in terms of easing the rate of pressure on households. • The results show how changes in age structure could be extremely relevant to the process of economic growth. Finally, there must be a sustainable momentum to boost monetary transactions among the people as a means of revitalizing the weakened social pillar. Doing so calls for a population rights approach to development planning that places people at the centre of developmental efforts. This will help in achieving the objectives envisaged for the social charter in the “NEEDS” framework. The determination for an appropriate mix of policies for managing Nigeria’s development requires prescriptions that recognize the structural linkages between the sectors. Such prescriptions must uniquely isolate, define and determine the nature and magnitude of the change variables that drive the development process. The necessity of such prescriptions should form the building blocks of national development planning and resource management. This entails reconciling planning with implementation and carrying out regular analysis of the challenges of population dynamics that underpins the NEEDS programme. ...|$|R
