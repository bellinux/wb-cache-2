5|$|The rivalries {{between the}} Datus, Rajahs, Sultans, and Lakans {{eventually}} eased Spanish colonization. Furthermore, the islands were sparsely populated due to consistent natural <b>disasters</b> <b>and</b> inter-kingdom conflicts.

5|$|In early 2001, the Workshop {{conducted}} a summative study {{about the effects}} of war, natural <b>disasters,</b> <b>and</b> other events on young children. It demonstrated that little was being done to address the fears and concerns of victims of traumatic events. As a result, the Workshop developed a series of materials it believed would help children (and their families) cope with events such as the September 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
40|$|Development to a {{large extent}} determines the way in which hazards impact on people. Meanwhile the {{occurrence}} of disasters alters the scope of development. Whilst a notion of the association of <b>disaster</b> <b>and</b> development is as old as development studies itself, recent decades have produced an intensifying demand for a fuller understanding. Evidence of <b>disaster</b> <b>and</b> development progressing together has attracted increased institutional attention. This engaging and accessible text illuminates the complexity of the relationship between <b>disaster</b> <b>and</b> development; it opens with an assessment of the scope of contemporary <b>disaster</b> <b>and</b> development studies, highlighting the rationale for looking at the two issues as part of the same topic. The second and third chapters detail development perspectives of <b>disaster,</b> <b>and</b> the influence of disaster on development. The fourth chapter exemplifies how human health is both a cause <b>and</b> consequence of <b>disaster</b> <b>and</b> development and the following chapter illustrates some of the learning and planning processes in <b>disaster</b> <b>and</b> development oriented practice. Early warning, risk management, mitigation, response and recovery actions provide the focus for the sixth and seventh chapters. The final chapter indicates some of the likely future contribution and challenges of combined <b>disaster</b> <b>and</b> development approaches. With an emphasis on putting people at the centre of <b>disaster</b> <b>and</b> development, the book avoids confronting readers with "no hope" representations, instead highlighting disaster reduction opportunities...|$|R

5|$|Humans had {{free will}} to ignore divine {{guidance}} {{and the behavior}} required by maat, but by doing so they could bring divine punishment upon themselves. A deity carried out this punishment using its ba, the force that manifested the god's power in the human world. Natural <b>disasters</b> <b>and</b> human ailments were seen {{as the work of}} angry divine bas. Conversely, the gods could cure righteous people of illness or even extend their lifespans. Both these types of intervention were eventually represented by deities: Shed, who emerged in the New Kingdom to represent divine rescue from harm, and Petbe, an apotropaic god from the late eras of Egyptian history who was believed to avenge wrongdoing.|$|E
5|$|In Norse mythology, Ragnarök is {{a series}} of future events, {{including}} a great battle, foretold to ultimately result in the death of a number of major figures (including the gods Odin, Thor, Týr, Freyr, Heimdallr, and Loki), the occurrence of various natural <b>disasters,</b> <b>and</b> the subsequent submersion of the world in water. Afterward, the world will resurface anew and fertile, the surviving and returning gods will meet, and the world will be repopulated by two human survivors. Ragnarök is an important event in Norse mythology, and {{has been the subject of}} scholarly discourse and theory throughout the history of Germanic studies.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of Nødnett, Norway had three separate systems for telecommunications within the police, fire departments and paramedics, all based on analog radio. The old system had two main downsides: it was not encrypted, and it prevented communication between agencies. This was particularly problematic in larger <b>disasters</b> <b>and</b> accidents, and in instances where criminals listened to the police radio during police actions. The Norwegian Data Inspectorate had also instructed the agencies to encrypt their communications for reasons of privacy. This would either have to be done through an expensive upgrade to the existing systems, or through the construction of a new, digital network.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species may}} be in risk of {{extinction}} even without complete deforestation, such as ruffed lemurs, which {{are very sensitive to}} habitat disturbance. If large fruit trees are removed, the forest may sustain fewer individuals of a species and their reproductive success may be affected for years. Small populations may be able to persist in isolated forest fragments for 20 to 40years due to long generation times, but in the long term, such populations may not be viable. Small, isolated populations also risk extirpation by natural <b>disasters</b> <b>and</b> disease outbreaks (epizootics). Two diseases that are lethal to lemurs and could severely impact isolated lemur populations are toxoplasmosis, which is spread by feral cats, and the herpes simplex virus carried by humans.|$|E
5|$|The Chinooks have mainly {{been used}} to support the Australian Army, though they have {{performed}} {{a wide range of}} other tasks. Three Chinooks took part in the Iraq War during 2003, when they transported supplies and Australian special forces. A detachment of two Chinooks was also deployed to Afghanistan during the northern spring and summer months for each year between 2006 and 2013, seeing extensive combat. Two of the CH-47s deployed to Afghanistan were destroyed as a result of crashes. The helicopters have also frequently been assigned to assist recovery efforts following natural <b>disasters</b> <b>and</b> undertook a range of civilian construction tasks while being operated by the RAAF.|$|E
5|$|The {{excellent}} vertebrate {{fossil record}} of Two Medicine and Judith River rocks {{resulted from a}} combination of abundant animal life, periodic natural <b>disasters,</b> <b>and</b> the deposition of large amounts of sediment.

The Judith River Group preserves the remains of many aquatic amphibians and reptiles, including frogs, salamanders, turtles, Champsosaurus and crocodilians. Terrestrial lizards, including whiptails, skinks, monitors and alligator lizards have also been discovered. Azhdarchid pterosaurs, and birds like Apatornis and Avisaurus flew overhead, while several varieties of mammals coexisted with Daspletosaurus and other types of dinosaurs in the various formations that make up the Judith River wedge.|$|E

Stottlemyre visited and raised money for a nine-year-old girl who suffered from aplastic anemia and required a bone marrow transplant, while Moyer's foundation raised US$6million to support underprivileged children. Other winners devoted their work to aiding individuals who had a specific illness, such as Curt Schilling, who raised money for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Trevor Hoffman, who lost a kidney as an infant and devoted himself to working with individuals with nephropathy. Also, some winners devoted themselves to work with major <b>disasters</b> <b>and</b> tragedies. Bobby Valentine donated money to charities benefiting victims of the September 11 attacks, while Luis Gonzalez worked with survivors of Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
5|$|After {{wintering}} in {{the western}} coastlands of Asia Minor, the Arab army crossed into Thrace in early summer 717 and built siege lines to blockade the city, which was protected by the massive Theodosian Walls. The Arab fleet, which accompanied the land army and was meant to complete the city's blockade by sea, was neutralized soon after its arrival by the Byzantine navy {{through the use of}} Greek fire. This allowed Constantinople to be resupplied by sea, while the Arab army was crippled by famine and disease during the unusually hard winter that followed. In spring 718, two Arab fleets sent as reinforcements were destroyed by the Byzantines after their Christian crews defected, and an additional army sent overland through Asia Minor was ambushed and defeated. Coupled with attacks by the Bulgars on their rear, the Arabs were forced to lift the siege on 15 August 718. On its return journey, the Arab fleet was almost completely destroyed by natural <b>disasters</b> <b>and</b> Byzantine attacks.|$|E
