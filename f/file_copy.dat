5|$|Modern historians, {{including}} Ian Wood and Rob Meens, {{have seen}} the Libellus as indicating that Augustine had more contact with native British Christians than is indicated by Bede's narrative in the Historia Ecclesiastica. Augustine's original questions (no longer extant) would {{have been sent to}} Rome around 598, but Gregory's reply (i.e. the Libellus) was delayed some years due to illness, and was not composed until perhaps the summer of 601. The Libellus may have been brought back to Augustine by Laurence and Peter, along with letters to the king of Kent and his wife and other items for the mission. However, some scholars have suggested that the Libellus may in fact never have reached its intended recipient (Augustine) in Canterbury. Paul Meyvaert, for example, has noted that no early Anglo-Saxon copy of the Libellus survives that is earlier than Bede's Historia ecclesiastica (ca 731), and Bede's copy appears to derive not from a Canterbury <b>file</b> <b>copy</b> but rather from a Continental canon law collection. This would be strange had the letter arrived in Canterbury in the first place. A document as important to the fledgling mission and to the history of the Canterbury church as the Libellus is likely to have been protected and preserved quite carefully by Canterbury scribes; yet this seems not to have been the case. Meyvaert therefore suggested that the Libellus may have been waylaid on its journey north from Rome in 601, and only later arrived in England, long after Augustine's death. This hypothesis is supported by the surviving manuscript and textual evidence, which strongly suggests that the Libellus circulated widely on the Continent for perhaps nearly a century before finally arriving in England (see below). Still, the exact time, place, and vector by which the Libellus arrived in England and fell into the hands of Bede (and thence his Historia Ecclesiastica) is still far from certain, and scholars continue to explore these questions.|$|E

25|$|On {{the opening}} night {{the play is}} going very well. In his {{dressing}} room, a strangely calm Riggan confesses to his ex-wife Sylvia that several years ago he attempted to drown himself in the ocean after she caught him having an affair. He also tells her about his inner Birdman voice, which she ignores. After Sylvia wishes him luck and leaves the room, Riggan picks up a real gun and checks that it is loaded for the final scene in which his character commits suicide. At the climax, Riggan shoots himself in the head on-stage. The play receives a standing ovation as Tabitha rushes out to <b>file</b> <b>copy.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In September 2011, Crabapple {{was living}} in a studio near Zuccotti Park. [...] Occupy Wall Street protesters had begun to use the Park as a camp to stage their movement, artists began {{creating}} posters and Crabapple decided to contribute work and engage in the movement. [...] "Before Occupy I felt like using my art for activist causes was exploitive of activist causes," [...] she told the Village Voice. [...] "I think what Occupy let me do was it allowed me to instead of just donating money to politics or just going to marches, it allowed me to engage my art in politics." [...] Artists and journalists who had {{come from all over the}} world to report on the protests were using Crabapple's apartment as an [...] "impromptu salon" [...] for the Occupy movement. In Discordia (2012), British journalist Laurie Penny remembered how [...] "Occupy Wall Street had set up camp two streets away from Crabapple's apartment in Manhattan and we'd just spent a sleepless week documenting arrests. [...] Molly perched at her desk churning out protest posters and handing them to activists to copy and wheat-paste all over the financial district...After three days, the word went out that there was an apartment near the protest camp where you could find hot drinks, basic medical attention and a place to charge your gadgets and <b>file</b> <b>copy.</b> The flat became a temporary sanctuary for stray activists and journalists" [...] "I started doing protest posters," [...] Crabapple recalled. [...] "And in doing these, I found my voice." [...] Author Matt Taibbi called Crabapple [...] "Occupy's greatest artist", [...] noting the use of the [...] "vampire squid" [...] theme in her Occupy artwork. [...] Crabapple, a fan of Taibbi's writing, had read his 2009 Rolling Stone article, [...] "The Great American Bubble Machine". [...] In the article, Taibbi referred to Goldman Sachs as [...] "a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money." [...] When Crabapple used Taibbi's metaphor as a stencil depicting a vampire squid and released it for anyone to use, it went viral throughout the Occupy movement.|$|E
