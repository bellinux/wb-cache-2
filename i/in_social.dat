In a two-period model with uncertainty about life-expectancy, it is shown that for a given annuity price tax incentives for life annuities increases consumption expenditures in old-age, while the opposite occurs by a cut <b>in</b> the <b>social</b> security benefits and by an increase of the social security tax. The main result is that a tax incentive for life annuities and a cut <b>in</b> the <b>social</b> security benefits alleviate adverse selection in the private annuity market, while an increase <b>in</b> the <b>social</b> security tax exacerbates adverse selection. annuity market; uncertain lifetime; adverse selection; tax incentives; social security...|$|R
