5|$|Aside {{from the}} rover and its {{bridging}} kits, Jetman {{has access to}} three other pieces of equipment, {{all of which can}} be carried on the bonnet of the rover, albeit one at a time. Bombs must be used to destroy alien bases when they are encountered, which can only be accomplished when Jetman is flying above them. Another piece of <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> a cannon that may be mounted onto the rear side of the moon rover. The final piece of <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> a pair of teleporters which can be used to instantaneously transport the player to the teleporter's twin, thus allowing rapid transport around the moon.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{obligation}} {{for a given}} dive profile must {{be calculated}} and monitored {{to ensure that the}} risk of decompression sickness is controlled. Some <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> specifically for these functions, both during planning before the dive and during the dive. Other <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> used to mark the underwater position of the diver, as a position reference in low visibility or currents, or to assist the diver's ascent and control the depth.|$|E
5|$|To perform {{gas metal arc}} welding, {{the basic}} {{necessary}} <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> a welding gun, a wire feed unit, a welding power supply, a welding electrode wire, and a shielding gas supply.|$|E
25|$|On 31 January, six Al Jazeera {{journalists were}} arrested and their camera <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> seized. The journalists were {{released}} later that day, although the <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> reportedly not returned.|$|R
50|$|Theft of <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> {{a problem}} during filming. While filming in Brighton, all the {{catering}} <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> stolen and in Notting Hill Gate, a mobile kitchen with generator was stolen.|$|R
50|$|Most train <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> either Budd Rail Diesel Cars, or locomotive-hauled {{push-pull}} trains {{with former}} Reading FP7s. The diesel <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> maintained at the Reading Company/Conrail owned Reading Shops, in Reading, PA.|$|R
5|$|Attempting to {{list the}} {{equipment}} available to the DRC's land forces is difficult; most figures are unreliable estimates based on known items delivered in the past. The IISS's Military Balance 2007 and Orbat.com's Concise World Armies 2005 give only slightly differing figures however (the figures below are from the IISS Military Balance 2007). Much of the Army's <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> non-operational due to insufficient maintenance—in 2002 only 20 percent of the Army's armoured vehicles were estimated as being serviceable.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} is {{a product}} of combustion of organic matter under conditions of restricted oxygen supply, which prevents complete oxidation to carbon dioxide (CO2). Sources of carbon monoxide include cigarette smoke, house fires, faulty furnaces, heaters, wood-burning stoves, internal combustion vehicle exhaust, electrical generators, propane-fueled equipment such as portable stoves, and gasoline-powered tools such as leaf blowers, lawn mowers, high-pressure washers, concrete cutting saws, power trowels, and welders. Exposure typically occurs when <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> used in buildings or semi-enclosed spaces.|$|E
5|$|For safety, divers {{sometimes}} {{carry an}} additional independent scuba cylinder {{with its own}} regulator to mitigate out-of-air emergencies should the primary breathing gas supply fail. For much common recreational diving where a controlled emergency swimming ascent is acceptably safe, this extra <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> not needed or used. This extra cylinder {{is known as a}} bail-out cylinder, and may be carried in several ways, and can be any size that can hold enough gas to get the diver safely back to the surface.|$|E
50|$|The {{operation}} of Hollerith/BTM/IBM/Bull tabulators {{and many other}} types of unit record <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> directed by a control panel. Operation of Powers-Samas/Remington Rand unit record <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> directed by a connection box.|$|R
50|$|Several {{options for}} train <b>equipment</b> <b>were</b> being considered. One is the Stadler GTW-built {{diesel-electric}} DMU (diesel multiple unit) cars used on New Jersey Transit's River LINE. <b>Equipment</b> <b>was</b> {{to be stored}} at the unused depot in Devault; these tracks were previously used by the Maslo paper company.|$|R
50|$|The {{property}} at 2700 Hardy Street was foreclosed, and {{the property and}} <b>equipment</b> <b>were</b> sold at auction on June 25, 2013 for $375,000. The property and <b>equipment</b> <b>were</b> used to establish the James River Distillery.|$|R
5|$|On a {{domestic}} scale, the spade, fork, and hoe are {{the tools of}} choice while on commercial farms a range of mechanical <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> available. Besides tractors, these include ploughs, harrows, drills, transplanters, cultivators, irrigation equipment, and harvesters. New techniques are changing the cultivation procedures involved in growing vegetables with computer monitoring systems, GPS locators, and self-steer programs for driverless machines giving economic benefits.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen {{first aid}} {{has been used}} as an {{emergency}} treatment for diving injuries for years. If given within the first four hours of surfacing, it increases the success of recompression therapy as well as decreasing the number of recompression treatments required. Most fully closed-circuit rebreathers can deliver sustained high concentrations of oxygen-rich breathing gas and {{could be used as a}} means of supplying oxygen if dedicated <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> not available.|$|E
5|$|Play It Again Sports {{purchases}} and sells used sports goods and is Winmark's largest chain. Roughly 70% of Play It Again Sports' sports <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> new. In 2011, it had over 330 {{locations in the}} United States and Canada. In 2010, the complete cost to start a Play It Again Sports was $300,000 and the average yearly sales were between $650,000 and $725,000.|$|E
50|$|To {{perform the}} test, 400 tons of <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> {{placed in a}} shaft 6,150 feet deep and 90 inches wide. Test support <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} to survive a ground upheaval of 15 feet at test time.|$|R
40|$|The {{interfaces}} {{between the}} scientific instruments and the Spacelab/Labcraft <b>equipment</b> <b>are</b> described.

5000|$|In addition, old <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> retired slowly. In 1986 {{the average}} age of {{industrial}} machinery and <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> 12 years; 10 percent of the machinery was more than 25 years old, and the percentage was reportedly increasing.|$|R
5|$|The {{choice between}} scuba and surface {{supplied}} diving <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> based on both legal and logistical constraints. Where the diver requires mobility {{and a large}} range of movement, scuba is usually the choice if safety and legal constraints allow. Higher risk work, particularly commercial diving, may be restricted to surface supplied equipment by legislation and codes of practice.|$|E
5|$|The <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> {{relatively}} inexpensive and simple, generally employing the combustion of acetylene in oxygen {{to produce a}} welding flame temperature of about 3100°C. The flame, since it is less concentrated than an electric arc, causes slower weld cooling, {{which can lead to}} greater residual stresses and weld distortion, though it eases the welding of high alloy steels. A similar process, generally called oxyfuel cutting, is used to cut metals.|$|E
5|$|The {{grinding}} <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> {{powered by}} a pair of overshot wheels, which transfer power to the crown wheel via a series of belts. This then drives the grinding stones and sack lift. There is a doorway on the first floor to allow material to be hoisted up the building.|$|E
50|$|Personnel and <b>equipment</b> <b>were</b> {{transferred}} from Richmond to San Jose starting 23 February 1955. The last truckload of <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> scheduled to depart Richmond on 26 February 1955, {{with most of}} the transfer work performed by Ford employees working overtime.|$|R
50|$|The {{surviving}} {{engines and}} <b>equipment</b> <b>are</b> significant {{as evidence of}} the first application of coal-fired gas producers in the electricity industry within Australia. This <b>equipment</b> <b>was</b> built specifically for the Longreach Powerhouse by Major Furnace and Combustions Pty Ltd in Melbourne.|$|R
50|$|Generally, the VNMC {{weapons and}} {{personal}} <b>equipments</b> <b>were</b> mostly (if not all) {{supplied by the}} United States Marine Corps during the war. However, certain <b>equipment</b> <b>were</b> also routed from the Army as well. The VNMC rarely had any <b>equipment</b> that <b>was</b> RVN genuine, because the unit was US-advised. However, their tigerstripe camouflage uniform was considered genuine and is still a valuable collector's item.|$|R
5|$|The mill {{stands on}} a site where a mill was first {{recorded}} in the Domesday Book, but the present building was constructed around 1780. It closed in 1962 but was restored in 1979 and is still used to grind flour. The <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> powered by two overshot wheels. It {{is owned by the}} National Trust but operated as a tourist attraction by a private company.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedures}} used for decompression {{depend on the}} mode of diving, the available equipment, the site and environment and the actual dive profile. Standardized procedures have been developed that provide an acceptable level of risk in appropriate circumstances. Different sets of procedures are used by commercial, military, scientific and recreational divers, though there is considerable overlap where similar <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> used, and some concepts are common to all decompression procedures.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{returning}} to their tent, they find that their possessions have been rifled through, and Josh's <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> covered with slime. As they continue, they come across a log on a river identical to one they crossed earlier. They realize they have walked in a circle, despite having traveled south all day, and once again make camp. Josh suffers a breakdown while holding the camera, taunting Heather for their circumstances and her constant recording of the events.|$|E
5|$|A delayed or {{deployable}} surface {{marker buoy}} (DSMB) is a soft inflatable tube which {{is attached to}} a reel or spool line at one end, and is inflated by the diver under water and released to float to the surface, deploying the line as it ascends. This provides information to the surface that the diver is about to ascend, and where he is. This <b>equipment</b> <b>is</b> commonly used by recreational and technical divers, and requires a certain level of skill to operate safely. Once deployed, it can be used for the same purposes as the standard surface marker and reel, and in the same way, but they are mostly used to signal the boat that the diver has started ascent or to indicate a problem in technical diving.|$|E
