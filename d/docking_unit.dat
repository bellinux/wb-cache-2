40|$|Abstract: We {{describe}} {{the results of}} the investigation of free oscillations of the International Space Station (ISS) body. These oscillations appeared during docking or undocking of the spacecrafts {{and as a result of}} firing of thrusters of the Service Module (SM) attitude control system. The investigation was realized basing on the measurements of the low-frequency accelerometer MAMS. We picked out 14 segment of data for the investigation. All these segments were obtained in 2005 and 2006. Then we analyzed on those data segments only subsegments that corresponded to the process of free elastic oscillations of the station body. The typical frequencies of such oscillations and corresponding damping constants were estimated. The comparative analysis of the results received for the different <b>docking</b> <b>units</b> and for the different SM thrusters sets was carried out. Note: Publication language:russia...|$|R
5000|$|The Smart Display was a {{battery-powered}} 10" [...] or 15" [...] LCD monitor with a touchscreen (similar in {{size and}} shape to a Tablet PC), connecting to a PC over an 802.11b WiFi network, with input via Transcriber (similar to Graffiti) or a pop-up soft-keyboard for text entry, and built-in speakers. Some models had a <b>docking</b> <b>unit</b> with wired PC, keyboard and mouse connectors.|$|E
50|$|Fifth {{expedition}} to Salyut 7. Visited by 6th and 7th expeditions. The three-person Mayak crew entered the darkened Salyut 7 station carrying flashlights. The cosmonauts {{commented on the}} burnt-metal odor of the drogue <b>docking</b> <b>unit.</b> By 17 February, Salyut 7 was fully reactivated, and the cosmonauts had settled into a routine. Physician Oleg Atkov did household chores and monitored his own health {{and that of his}} colleagues, who conducted experiments. During the previous year a fuel line on the station had ruptured. Kizim and Solovyov carried out three EVAs to try to fix the problem during the mission.|$|E
50|$|Preparations for {{the first}} EVA {{involving}} a non-Soviet/non-U.S. space traveler forced the cosmonauts to cut short a TV meeting with diplomats from 47 countries on December 8. On December 9, Chrétien and Volkov depressurized the multiport docking adapter and clambered outside Mir. Chrétien was first out. He installed handrails, then attached the 15.5 kg (34 lb) Échantillons experiment rack to the handrails by springs and hooks. He also attached electrical wires leading from the rack to Mir’s power supply. Échantillons carried five technological experiments with applications to the Hermes shuttle program. Volkov and Chrétien then assembled the 240 kg (530 lb) experimental deployable structure (known as ERA). They attached a mount to handrails on the frustum linking the multiport <b>docking</b> <b>unit</b> to the small-diameter portion of the work compartment. After resolving problems with cables linking ERA to a control panel inside Mir, they attached the folded ERA structure to a support arm on the platform. The structure was designed to unfold to form a flat six-sided structure 1 metre deep by 3.8 metres across. From inside Mir, Krikalev commanded the structure to unfold, but to no avail. Volkov then kicked ERA, causing it to unfold properly. According to Krikalev, taking the ERA outside helped relieve the crowding problems. The EVA lasted 5 hours and 57 minutes.|$|E

5000|$|Several Polish light minelayers laid a {{minefield}} near Hel in {{the night}} of 12 and 13 September. After some of the Polish ships were sunk by the Luftwaffe on the following day, and due to German control of the Baltic Sea, the remaining Polish naval <b>units</b> <b>docked</b> at Hel port and their crews joined the ground forces. The ships' armaments were stripped and converted into additional land gun emplacements. German naval units, including old battleships [...] and , shelled the Hel peninsula from 18 September, but with little effect. Schleswig-Holstein was lightly damaged by Polish coastal batteries on 25 September. Hel anti-aircraft batteries proved to be extremely efficient, shooting down between 46 and 53 German aircraft during the battle.|$|R
50|$|Daisenryaku Expert WWII: War in Europe ("Great Strategy Expert WWII") is a Super Famicom {{game that}} takes place during World War II. There is a {{scenario}} mode and a campaign mode. The player usually controls the Third Reich as a default {{but it can be}} changed prior to the game. The action takes place on both the Eastern Front and the Western front. The final battle involves either defending Berlin or attempting to occupy it. Like most Daisenryaku games, airplanes can only be manufactured on airports, ships can only be manufactured on <b>docks,</b> and land-based <b>units</b> can only be manufactured on urban hexes that are closest to the headquarters. Dive bombers can destroy cities and airports, destroying people and supplies. Even when retreating, enemy combatants can still catch up to the retreating units and knock them out, providing that they have enough ammo and gasoline to do the job.|$|R
40|$|Development {{of small}} ports for {{recreational}} purposes {{is one of}} the most discussion perspectives in both Lithuania and Western Europe. There is no single opinion on the possibility to accomplish this development without badly affecting natural systems. Different methods that estimate sustainable development are suggested for large ports that have loading <b>docks,</b> ship repair <b>units,</b> etc. These methods cannot be applied to small recreational ports. The analysis suggests newly developed methods that allow to evaluate sustainable development of recreational ports and to calculate certain indicators on an example of Sventoji small port. The systematic analysis of port activity consists of existing port operations and processes, technogenic port processes identification, evaluation of the significant natural environment and technogenic environment aspects. According to the values of selected aspects the evaluation of current and planned situation is carried out and the factors mostly affecting the environment are identified. Effective use of energy and waste in port activity and the change of indicators for reaching the balance are evaluated...|$|R
40|$|The {{international}} Low Impact Docking System (iLIDS) {{provides a}} structural arrangement {{that allows for}} visiting vehicles to dock with the International Space Station (ISS) (Fig 1). The iLIDS <b>docking</b> <b>units</b> are mechanically joined together {{by a series of}} active and passive latch hooks. In order to preserve docking capability at the existing Russian docking interfaces, the iLIDS latch hooks are required to conform to the existing Russian design. The latch hooks are classified as being fail-safe. Since the latch hooks are fail-safe, the hooks are not fracture critical and a fatigue based service life assessment will satisfy the structural integrity requirements. Constant amplitude fatigue testing to failure on four sets of active/passive iLIDS latch hooks was performed at load magnitudes of 10, 11, and 12 kips. Failure analysis of the hook fatigue failures identified multi-site fatigue initiation that was effectively centered about the hook mid-plane (consistent with the 3 D model results). The fatigue crack initiation distribution implies that the fatigue damage accumulation effectively results in a very low aspect ratio surface crack (which can be simulated as thru-thickness crack). Fatigue damage progression resulted in numerous close proximity fatigue crack initiation sites. It was not possible to determine if fatigue crack coalescence occurs during cyclic loading or as result of the fast fracture response. The presence of multiple fatigue crack initiation sites on different planes will result in the formation of ratchet marks as the cracks coalesce. Once the stable fatigue crack becomes unstable and the fast fracture advances across the remaining ligament and the plane stress condition at a free-surface will result in failure along a 45 deg. shear plane (slant fracture) and the resulting inclined edge is called a shear lip. The hook thickness on the plane of fatigue crack initiation is 0. 787 ". The distance between the shear lips on this plane was on the order of 0. 48 " and it was effectively centered about the mid-plane of the section. The numerous ratchet marks between the shear lips on the fracture initiation plane are indicative of multiple fatigue initiation sites within this region. The distribution of the fatigue damage about the centerline of the hook is consistent with the analytical results that demonstrate peak stress/strain response at the mid-plane that decreases {{in the direction of the}} hook outer surfaces. Scanning electron microscope images of the failed sections detected fatigue crack striations in close proximity to the free surface of the hook radius. These findings were documented at three locations on the fracture surface : 1) adjacent to the left shear lip, 2) adjacent to the right shear lip, and 3) near the centerline of the section. The features of the titanium fracture surface did not allow for a determination of a critical crack size via identification of the region where the fatigue crack propagation became unstable. The fracture based service life projections where benchmarked with strain-life analyses. The strainrange response in the hook radius was defined via the correlated finite element models and the modified method of universal slopes was incorporated to define the strain-life equation for the titanium alloy. The strain-life assessment confirmed that the fracture based projections were reasonable for the loading range of interest. Based upon the analysis and component level fatigue test data a preliminary service life capability for the iLIDS active and passive hooks of 2 lifetimes is projected (includes a scatter factor of 4) ...|$|R

40|$|One of {{priority}} {{programs of the}} Ocean Fishing Facility State Company was to develop its business units to meet the needs, and to improve the company's services to be more efficient and professional {{so that it could}} increase its contribution to the state. The aim {{of the study was to}} identify strategies for the company to maintain and develop its main business units. A descriptive case study has been carried out through the company at the corporate level, as well as at the branch offices. The primary data were collected through interviewing and questionnaire involving officers of the company, while the secondary data was collected through documents related to the company operation. Data analysis was carried out using internal and external factors evaluation and business unit portfolio technique. The study showed that the position of the company at corporate level falls into the fifth cell of the internal-external matrix in which the company classified as hold and maintain. At the business unit level, the study showed that the five main business units i. e., harbor service, ice production, and building facilities services were classified as the winners, dock yard services as average, and cold storage services was classified as profit producer. The study recommended a set of strategy for the development of each main business unit i. e., I) maintaining company's competitiveness was for the development of harbor service unit, building facility services unit, and the development of cold storage services unit, and 2) improvement of company's competitiveness was for the development of ice production and <b>dock</b> yard services <b>unit.</b> Besides that, the study suggested the company to improve its function through the improvement of data and information center, as well as the improvement of the role of research and development unit. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} to improve control and design in organic crystallization, the effect of solvent on {{polymorph}} selection has gained tremendous interest in recent years. In this thesis, molecular simulation techniques are used to gain insight into the solvent effect on glycine crystallization in water-methanol mixtures. We report the validation of the Optimized Potential for Liquid Simulations (OPLS) force field and parameters with modified Lennard-Jones parameters for hydrogens attached to a-carbon in glycine zwitterion. Solution and interface simulations in water and 50 % v/v water-methanol solutions reveal the mechanism through which methanol additive results in the crystallization of the least stable [Beta]-glycine polymorph. Free energy calculations through the Umbrella Sampling method show an increased stability of the centrosymmetric dimer structure ([alpha]-glycine growth unit) {{in the presence of}} the methanol additive. Even though the dimer structure is more stable in water-methanol mixtures, a higher fraction of glycine monomers were observed in water-methanol mixtures. It is revealed through thermodynamic arguments that a drastic decrease in solubility results in a higher fraction of glycine monomers in water-methanol mixtures. It was hypothesized in previous studies that the presence of monomer <b>units</b> <b>docking</b> onto the (010) interface of [alpha]-glycine inhibits further growth due to exposed ammonium groups at the interface. The effect of solvent on crystal growth inhibition is explored by the interface simulations of a-glycine in water-methanol mixtures. When the monomer <b>units</b> are <b>docked</b> onto the interface, water is shown to be more effective than methanol in inhibiting crystal growth of (010) interface of [alpha]-glycine. This study sheds light on the role played by the solvent on glycine polymorph selection in water-methanol solutions. by Srihanth Patala. Thesis (S. M.)
