25|$|The <b>eye</b> of a <b>hook,</b> {{although}} some hooks are technically eyeless, {{is the point}} where the hook is connected to the line. <b>Hook</b> <b>eye</b> design is usually optimized for either strength, weight and/or presentation. There are different types of <b>eyes</b> to the <b>hooks.</b> Typical <b>eye</b> types include the ring or ball eye, a brazed eye-the eye is fully closed, a tapered eye to reduce weight, a looped eye—traditional on Atlantic Salmon flies, needle eyes, and spade end—no eye at all, but a flattened area to allow secure snelling of the leader to the <b>hook.</b> <b>Hook</b> <b>eyes</b> can also be positioned one of three ways on the shank—up turned, down turned or straight.|$|R

50|$|A turle knot is a knot used while {{fishing for}} tying a hook or fly to a leader. It {{is named after}} Major William Greer Turle, a 19th-century English angler who popularized the knot but did not claim to have invented it. Turle was a {{contemporary}} of Frederic M. Halford and fished the chalkstreams of Hampshire with Halford in the late 19th century and was an early pioneer {{in the use of}} <b>eyed</b> <b>hooks</b> for fly fishing. It has sometimes, wrongly, been referred to as the turtle knot.|$|R
50|$|The Hanging Chairs - The contestants must {{install a}} chair {{which is to}} be {{suspended}} from the ceiling. Due to unsteady hands by everyone, {{at least one of the}} two hanging <b>eye</b> <b>hooks</b> needed was too large for their anchors, but a copper wire trick that Andrew teaches to each of the contestants manages to make Charlene, Matt, and Ajay pass without much additional effort. Rob's installation is also fine, except that he injures himself installing one of the holes. Dan both rejects the copper wire trick and he injures himself, and fails.|$|R
5000|$|A becket hitch, {{including}} the double becket or figure-of-eight becket hitch, is any hitch {{that is made}} on an eye loop, i.e. on a [...] A becket hitch has the same structure as the sheet bend, which joins, or [...] "bends", the ends of two ropes together. The becket hitch, in contrast, fixes a rope to a closed <b>eye</b> or <b>hook.</b> [...] In this instance, a becket means the <b>eye</b> or <b>hook</b> of a pulley block, an eye {{in the end of}} a rope, or a rope handle on a sailors sea chest.|$|R
50|$|A Picavet suspension, {{named after}} its French {{inventor}} Pierre Picavet, {{consists of a}} rigid cross suspended below the kite line from two points. A single line is threaded several times between the points of the cross and the points of attachment to the kite line and the rig {{is attached to the}} cross. The Picavet line runs through <b>eye</b> <b>hooks</b> or small pulleys so that the weight of the rig causes it to settle naturally into a level position. The dimensions and shape of the Picavet have been adapted many times in attempts to increase stability or to improve portability.|$|R
50|$|H. Cholmondeley-Pennell is his 1886 {{edition of}} Modern Improvements in Fishing Tackle and Fish Hooks {{described}} the Turle Knot thus:For attachment to a bare hook I have been hitherto {{in the habit}} of using a very ingenious knot invented by Major Turle, and known under his name.* Attached to the turn-down <b>eyed</b> <b>hook</b> it answers excellently well, as I can testify from experience, having used nothing else for many weeks in sea and river fishing, when the catch amounted to some thousands of whiting, mackerel, gurnets, flat-fish, &c., and also in legering and float-fishing on the Thames and Norfolk Broads for bream, roach, barbel, chub, perch, and gudgeon.|$|R
50|$|The snell knot is a hitch knot used {{to attach}} an <b>eyed</b> fishing <b>hook</b> to fishing line. Hooks {{tied with a}} snell knot provide an even, straight-line pull to the fish. It passes through the <b>eye</b> of the <b>hook,</b> but {{primarily}} attaches to the shaft. It is a very secure knot, {{but because it is}} easily tied using only the near end as the working end, it is used to attach a hook only to a leader, rather than directly to the main line.|$|R
6000|$|... "Owls {{have big}} heads, round <b>eyes,</b> <b>hooked</b> bills, and strong claws. Some are gray, some white, some black and yellowish. Their {{feathers}} are very soft, and stick out a great deal. They fly very quietly, and hunt bats, mice, little birds, and such things. They build nests in barns, hollow trees, and some take the nests of other birds. The {{great horned owl}} has two eggs bigger than a hen's and reddish brown. The tawny owl has five eggs, white and smooth; {{and this is the}} kind that hoots at night. Another kind sounds like a child crying. They eat mice and bats whole, and the parts that they cannot digest they make into little balls and spit out." ...|$|R
50|$|The knotless knot is a hitch knot used {{to attach}} an <b>eyed</b> fishing <b>hook</b> to fishing line while leaving {{a length of}} line hanging below the hook. The extra length of line can then {{be used as the}} hair of a hair rig.|$|R

40|$|An 11 -year-old boy was {{involved}} in an injury with a fish-hook to his <b>eye.</b> The <b>hook</b> had impaled itself to the cornea and deeper structures. There was associated corneal edema and hyphema, making visualization difficult. In this case, we performed the unusual "cut-it-out" technique to remove the <b>hook</b> from the <b>eye...</b>|$|R
50|$|The big {{breakthrough}} George de Mestral {{made was}} {{to think about}} hook-and-eye closures on a greatly reduced scale. <b>Hook</b> and <b>eye</b> fasteners have been common for centuries, but what was new about hook and loop fasteners was the miniaturisation of the <b>hooks</b> and <b>eyes.</b> Shrinking the <b>hooks</b> led to the two other important differences. Firstly, instead of a single-file line of hooks, touch fasteners have a two-dimensional surface. This was needed, because in decreasing {{the size of the}} hooks, the strength was also unavoidably lessened, thus requiring more hooks for the same strength. The other difference is that hook and loop has indeterminate match-up between the <b>hooks</b> and <b>eyes.</b> With larger <b>hook</b> and <b>eye</b> fasteners, each <b>hook</b> has its own eye. On a scale as small as that of hook and loop fasteners, matching up each of these hooks with the corresponding eye is impractical, thus leading to the indeterminate matching.|$|R

60|$|Thus {{he spoke}} and was silent, turning his eyes toward the third messenger, he {{who wore a}} cloth or napkin upon his head that was pierced with eyeholes and hung down to the breast. With a quick motion, the man dragged off this veil and threw it to the ground, {{revealing}} a very noble countenance, not black like that of his followers, but copper-coloured. He was about fifty years of age, with deep-set flashing <b>eyes,</b> <b>hooked</b> nose, and a flowing, grizzled beard. The collar of gold about his neck showed that his rank was high, but when we noticed a second ornament of gold, also upon his brow, we knew {{that it must be}} supreme. For this ornament was nothing less than the symbol of royalty, once worn by the ancient Pharaohs of Egypt, the double snakes of the uraeus bending forward as though to strike, which, as we had seen, rose also from the brow of the lion-headed sphinx of Harmac.|$|R

Architectural elements such as pillars, beams or platforms continued to be used to convey moods.

5000|$|The {{original}} surf candy flies {{were tied}} with white buck tail wings and without eyes. Popovics coated the entire head and {{body of the}} fly with epoxy for durability. Early surf candy flies were also tied with polar bear fur for added translucency. [...] Original versions used a red marker to place a red slash behind to the head to simulate gills. Today's surf candy flies are typically tied with synthetic fibers, Mylar flash for accents and body and some form of eyes. Instead of epoxy, fly tiers use various ultraviolet or blue light cured cements for a faster drying time. Epoxy or UV cured cements are applied to the entire body of the fly from <b>hook</b> <b>eye</b> to <b>hook</b> bend for durability and translucency. Eyes {{can be added to}} the head of the fly a more realistic pattern. Most surf candy flies are tied with clear monofilament threads to enhance the effects of translucency.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design of}} the hair behind the ear of Elizabeth II [...] "gave the {{illusion}} of a grinning demon", leading to the banknote series nickname [...] "Devil's Head". The demon was described as having [...] "pouchy <b>eyes,</b> <b>hooked</b> nose with flared nostrils and thick loose lips". The devil's head appearance {{can be seen in the}} banknote obverses illustrated above, particularly if the right-hand side of the Queen's head is enlarged. British alderman H.L. Hogg of Hartlepool stated that the perfection of the devil's face appearance in the banknote resulted from [...] "the fiendish {{design of the}} artist...or the engraver who made the plate" [...] and wrote a letter of complaint to Norman Robertson, the High Commissioner for Canada in the United Kingdom in March 1956. The Bank of Canada had begun addressing the problem in late 1955, and in March 1956, it announced that it had ordered the Canadian Bank Note Company and BA International to modify the engraved printing plates for all banknote denominations, resulting in printed banknotes having darkened highlights of the hair behind the ear. Banknotes printed using the new plates were issued later that year. The original banknotes of this series now command high prices amongst numismatics dealers and collectors.|$|R

50|$|Works {{done in the}} hikime kagibana style show {{faces with}} {{essentially}} identical features.: slit <b>eyes</b> and <b>hook</b> nose. The Hikime Kagibana style also does not allow a full front view of a face. There are only two main viewpoints used to depict faces: an oblique angle of 30 degrees from the front and a right angle giving a profile. When faces are shown from a right angle, the eyebrows and corners of the eyes are visible but the nose is not -- {{something that is not}} possible in actuality.|$|R

Males have richly colored metallic plumage, metallic on the upperparts. Although many have brightly coloured bare eye-rings, they lack the colorful patches of bare facial skin in their African counterparts, Apaloderma. [...] Females and young are duller and sometimes hard to identify in the field. [...] Eggs are white or bluish-white, unlike the pale blue eggs of quetzals.

5000|$|At {{the age of}} 12, Megan {{began taking}} fly tying lessons from Bob Trussler, another river keeper on the estate. Trussler's tutelage went on for many years with {{emphasis}} on precision and quality. Boyd also relied on two classic salmon fly publications for tying instructions and pattern recipes. She considered How To Dress Salmon Flies-A Handbook for Amateurs (1914) by T. E. Pryce-Tannatt as her [...] "bible". She also relied on Kelson's The Salmon Fly (1895) for pattern advice. Her first paying fly tying work came when a Sir Charles Clauson requested she convert {{more than a dozen}} gut-eyed salmon flies onto the more modern <b>eyed</b> <b>hooks</b> or [...] "irons". After seeing her work, local salmon anglers began asking Megan to tie flies for them and her reputation began to grow. Megan made her reputation by tying classic and traditional flies such as the Jock Scott, Silver Doctor, Durham Ranger and Wilkinson. She always claimed she tied flies for anglers and resisted tying for commercial fly houses. Her flies were extraordinarily durable and lasted many seasons. Over the course of her 65-year tying career, some estimate she tied tens of thousands of salmon flies. Yet despite the huge numbers of salmon that could not resist her flies, she never fished herself. Now to disappoint all my customers, I do not fish, have no interest in fishing, and cannot even tie a fly to a cast. Attributed to Megan Boyd in The Women of a Graceful Rise ...|$|R

This black-finish ceramic style began in the Moche culture prior to the Early Sican, and shows the sharing of cultures in the region.
