25|$|The wrong-way car chase on a Los Angeles freeway {{sequence}} {{was one of}} {{the last}} things shot in the film and it took six weeks to shoot. At this point, Friedkin was working with a very stripped down crew. He came up with the idea of staging the chase against the flow of traffic on February 25, 1963 when he was driving home from a wedding in Chicago. He fell asleep at the wheel and woke up in the wrong lane with oncoming traffic heading straight for him. He swerved back to his side of the road and for the next 20 years wondered <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to use it in a film. He told stunt coordinator Buddy Joe Hooker that if they could come up with a chase better than the one in The French Connection then it would be in the film. If not, he would not use it. Petersen did a lot of his own driving during this sequence and actor John Pankow's stressed out reactions were real. Three weekends were spent on sections of the Terminal Island Freeway near Wilmington, California that were closed for four hours at a time to allow the crew to stage the chaotic chase. With delays, the film ran a reported $1 million over budget.|$|E
500|$|Songs {{performed}} {{during the}} tour were [...] "chosen because they fit the performance" [...] and fit Bowie's goal {{to make a}} show that was much more theatrical and had strong dramatic content. When he was asked <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to make his rock show [...] "dramatic", he replied, [...] "You'll be surprised {{what you can do}} with a 6-piece rock band and a stage and a couple of lights." ...|$|E
500|$|While Del Toro told Singer <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to portray}} Fenster, {{he did not}} tell his cast members, and in their first scene {{together}} none of them understood what Del Toro was saying. Byrne confronted Singer and the director told him that for the lockup scene, [...] "If you don't understand what he's saying maybe it's time we let the audience know that they don't need to know what he's saying." [...] This led to the inclusion of Kevin Pollak's improvised line, [...] "What did you say?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{research}} of several film scholars on Hitchcock's production of Psycho validates {{the claim that}} Bass {{in his capacity as}} a graphic artist did indeed have a significant influence on the visual design and pacing of that famous scene. Hitchcock had asked Bass to design and produce storyboards for the shower murder scene and for some other scenes in the film. For this, Bass received a credit as Pictorial Consultant as well as Title Designer. Janet Leigh told Donald Spoto that “the planning of the shower scene was left up to Saul Bass, and Hitchcock followed his storyboard precisely. Because of this [...] [...] [...] [...] went very professionally,” and she told Stephen Rebello that “Mr. Hitchcock showed Saul Bass’s storyboards to me quite proudly, telling me in exact detail <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to shoot the scene from Saul’s plans”.|$|E
2500|$|According to some scholars, [...] "Rehmat Ali’s {{concept of}} Pakistan was nebulous, {{impractical}} and fantasy-ridden. It was {{to include the}} entire northwest of India, Kashmir, the Kathiawar peninsula, Kutch, and several enclaves deep within UP, including Delhi and Lucknow. There were to be two independent Muslim states besides Pakistan: Bangistan comprising Bengal and Assam {{in the east and}} Osmanistan in the south. These two were to form a federation with Pakistan. The 243 principalities or Rajwaras were to be divided among caste Hindus and “others” and then herded together in a ghetto called Hanoodia. As for the Sikhs, they were to be pushed into an enclave called Sikhia. Other races and religions were to inhabit an encampment by the name of Hanadika. Every non-Muslim was to remain subservient to the master race he called “The Paks”, and yes, the subcontinent was to be renamed Dinia. He did not say <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to bring all that about." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Tom Leykis Show had {{its last}} regular {{terrestrial}} broadcast on Friday, February 20, 2009, and ended at 5 p.m., {{the middle of}} its usual time slot. Leykis took calls until the last five minutes. At that point, the host mentioned that people had asked him <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to end the show. Saying [...] "Let's tell the truth", Leykis commented that he knew since the previous summer {{that it was possible}} the flagship station (KLSX, which originated the broadcast of the show) would switch format. Saying he [...] "tossed and turned", he thought about it and asked himself: [...] "What could I say that would wrap this all up? And then I one day heard this song … and I realized – the lyrics of this song … are about me." [...] With that, Leykis rolled into Joe Jackson's [...] "I'm the Man" [...] (the title track of Jackson's 1979 album). By the time the song was over, the studio was filled with people—as could be seen by the live online video broadcast on the station website. The host thanked his producers, the program director, the crowd in the studio, and everyone in southern California who made it [...] "12 great years", and he finished with [...] "Let's do this thing one more time..." [...] The crowd yelled [...] "Blow me up, Tom" [...] one last time to end the show and mark the end of KLSX as [...] "The FM Talk Station" [...] in what coincidentally became a strikingly appropriate catch phrase to be had: The phrase [...] "blow up the station" [...] is a radio term for ending a particular format or station run. After a much longer than usual explosion sound effect, the crowd cheered and KLSX changed format from hot talk to CHR/Top 40.|$|E
