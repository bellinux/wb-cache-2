The {{analysis of these}} methods forms the catalyst and the main focus in the argument for a reappraisal of formalist theory within contemporary art practice. The working methods establish {{a significant departure from}} the conventions of painting influenced by formalist theory and culminating in the New York school of Abstract Expressionists {{in the middle of the}} twentieth century, where the expressive mark or gesture made by the artist was of paramount value. Instead, methods that provide for a disconnection from the expressive mark have been developed; such as a press and release technique similar to mono-printing; and a method that involves the movement of the canvas support rather than the expressive movement of the hand or arm of the maker. Formalism became the dominant theory in western visual arts in the middle of the twentieth century but for the past forty years has been seriously challenged by postmodern artists, critics and theorists. An historical background of formalism articulated by Roger Fry (1909; 1920), Clive Bell (1958) and Clement Greenberg (1939; 1940; 1960; 1961) is presented together with a critique of <b>formalist</b> <b>thought</b> by Suzi Gablik (1991; 2001), Rosalind Krauss (1981; 1993), and Thomas McEvilley (1990; 1993; 1996). The methods that have been developed in the production of the paintings, and how they relate to the issues raised in the analysis of formalism are discussed. In particular, issues relating to the role of the individual as painter, the disconnection from the expressive mark, and the content and meaning within the work are examined. The contrasting working methods of Irish American artist Sean Scully (b. 1945) and German artist Gerhard Richter (b. 1932) are used to illustrate this examination. A more moderate approach to formalism rather than the exclusive and extreme position held by Greenberg is proposed, one that still focuses on the formal qualities of the work as a primary consideration in the making and evaluation, but acknowledging other influences within the process of production, which in turn influence the reading of the final work. Many artists such as Mark Rothko (1952), Robert Motherwell (1982) and Howard Hodgkin (1996) have identified the retention of integrity as an essential quality within a painting. Jacques Maritain (1943; 1953) has presented an analysis of how truth and honesty is embedded in painting, but most writers and scholars have largely ignored him. By utilising his arguments, it is argued here that the integrity of the method of production is a vital characteristic in the evaluation of a painting and this thesis explores how it can be corrupted as well as retained. The significance of this body of work is that it extends the range of methods of image making within the field of abstract painting, particularly those that do not involve the expressive mark of the maker. Furthermore, it addresses the issue of integrity within the method of production in the visual arts, which is largely neglected in current literature...|$|E
2500|$|Both {{theories}} {{are associated with}} textualist and <b>formalist</b> schools of <b>thought,</b> however there are pronounced differences between them. Justice Scalia differentiated the two by pointing out that, unlike an originalist, a strict constructionist would not acknowledge that he uses a cane means he walks with a cane (because, strictly speaking, {{this is not what}} he uses a cane means). Scalia averred that he was [...] "not a strict constructionist, and no-one ought to be"; he goes further, calling strict constructionism [...] "a degraded form of textualism that brings the whole philosophy into disrepute".|$|R

Com efeito, a concepção substantivista - que {{define a}} economia como um processo instituído de interação entre o homem e o ambiente natural e social que o rodeia e resulta em contínua oferta de meios para satisfazer as necessidades humanas - constitui a base do método preconizado pelo autor: a análise institucional. Com tal distinção, Polanyi (1977 a) pretende evitar a "falácia economicista" que {{consiste}} na identificação automática da economia com sua forma de mercado. Ao contrário, só na moderna economia capitalista é que um "sistema de mercados formadores de preços" desempenha papel fundamental. Essas questões foram alvo de um "Grande Debate" entre as correntes substantivista - encabeçada por Polanyi - e formalista no contexto da disciplina da Antropologia Econômica. At {{the root of}} Polanyian thought, a distinction can be found between the substantive and formal concepts of the economy. In fact, the substantivist conception, that defines the economy as an instituted process of interaction between man and its natural and social environment, which results in a continuous supply of material means to meet human needs, constitutes {{the basis of the}} method recommended by the author: institutional analysis. With this distinction, Polanyi intends to avoid the "economistic fallacy", which consists of the automatic identification of the economy in its market form. Only in the modern capitalist economy does a system of "price-making markets" play a fundamental role. These questions were amply discussed in the so-called "Great Debate" between the substantivist and <b>formalist</b> schools of <b>thought</b> in the discipline of Economic Anthropology...|$|R
40|$|What do we mean {{by legal}} justice, as opposed to distributive, or social, or {{political}} justice; what is the justice, that is, we hope law promotes? What is the justice that lawyers and judges, peculiarly, are professionally committed to pursue? What is the virtue around which, arguably, this profession, and the individuals within it, have defined their public lives? Justice [...] and more particularly legal justice [...] is a badly under-theorized topic in jurisprudence; perhaps surprisingly, there is little written on it. The paucity of writing of course has a history. It {{can be traced to}} the turn of the last century [...] formative years of legal pedagogy and legal curriculum [...] when legal formalists and legal realists, who disagreed on virtually everything else regarding law, oddly enough agreed on the need to sever law from moral philosophy and more generally from high culture. Formalists, so as to render law autonomous, deductively pure, 2 ̆ 2 scientific, 2 ̆ 2 and resting on its own bottom, so to speak, and realists, so as to tie law to the prestige, aspirations, and methods of the then nascent but ascending social sciences. Both realists and formalists, albeit for different reasons, sought to disassociate law from the demands of religion, morals, or culture, generally from the Toquevillian aristocratic norms within which law had been nested in the pre-Classical era. Justice, the great <b>formalist</b> Christopher Langdell <b>thought,</b> was not a fit subject of thought for a rigorous and professional and scientific law school curriculum. Oliver Wendell Holmes, the father of legal realism, quite famously, was even harsher. 2 ̆ 2 I hate justice, 2 ̆ 2 Holmes wrote. 2 ̆ 2 I know that if a man begins to talk about that, for one reason or another he is shirking thinking in legal terms. 2 ̆ 2 At least in the legal academy, we have indeed taken the Holmesian admonition to heart. Fearful of appearing sentimental, childish, or, worst of all, ignorant of the law, twentieth century lawyers and legal scholars, with only a few exceptions, have forsook the work of elucidating the concept of legal justice. Holmes and Langdellian skepticism notwithstanding, one can quite easily discern a conventional, and largely uncriticized, turn-of-the-century understanding of legal justice, inside the academy and the profession. It finds oratorical expression in law day and graduation day speeches, in the major unspoken premises of countless conventional legal arguments, and in some, although again not much, jurisprudential scholarship. That conception [...] call it the dominant or conventional conception-I will argue below, is seriously flawed. More specifically, I want to suggest that it is seriously flawed in a way that directly and negatively affects feminist and progressive efforts at achieving political reform. Feminists and progressives need to take up the task of criticizing our conventional understanding of legal justice. More importantly, we need to take up the task of crafting alternatives...|$|R
