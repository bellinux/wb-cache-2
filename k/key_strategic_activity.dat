40|$|Much {{has been}} written about {{acquisition}} of knowledge and its role in survival and growth of small and entrepreneurial firms. Little, however, is known about the role of business model in knowledge acquiring activities of the firms. Therefore, by incorporating the cognitive and reified activity-based view of business model into the knowledge-based view (KBV) and absorptive capacity of the firms, this article attempts to address this deficiency. The author posits that business model is a holistic framework {{in the mind of the}} executives. It is embodied and reified in activities which employees and particularly executives perform to create and capture value for the firm. In light of this perspective knowledge acquisition is conceived as a <b>key</b> <b>strategic</b> <b>activity</b> whose scope, depth, and breadth are regulated by the business model of the firm. Adding to and extending KBV, this manuscript offers several contributions to theory and practice. Given this analysis, contributions of this view are presented, implications for theory and practice are discussed, and some fruitful areas for future research are highlighted. 21 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Innovation {{has been}} widely {{recognized}} as the <b>key</b> <b>strategic</b> <b>activity</b> for growth and success of small firms. However, small firms due to internal barriers (e. g. financial and human resources) and external barriers (e. g. external environment) are obstructed in developing innovation. Thus, {{it is critical to}} increase the understanding of how small firms can attain innovation. One perspective in the literature is the resource-based view of the firm. In this perspective it is generally proposed that a firms potential to be innovative lies in its ability to utilize different organizational capabilities. We follow this logic and propose two externally oriented capabilities that promote (Network capability) and facilitate (Information and communication technology capability) social networking practices. We argue these capabilities to be of importance especially in a small firm context and we hypothesize that their individual and joint effects on innovation are positive. We further acknowledge recent developments in the literature which suggest that capabilities are dependent on firm internal conditions such as flexibility and production. We therefore also include organizational slack and consider a three-way interaction effect between slack and the two proposed capabilities. Our basic argument is that capabilities will pay off for innovation when firms have slack resources. We also test howincreases in innovation influences firm performance. As such we suggest that innovation has a mediating role between capabilities and performance. We test the hypotheses based on a two year longitudinal dataset of Swedish technology-based small firms (less than 50 employees). In total 291 full responses were included out of the originally 1471 firms surveyed, for a response rate of 20 %. Main analyses are lagged regression with control for the dependent variables influence at t- 1. Results show innovativeness to be positively and significantly related to performance, even when performing controls for previous years of performance. We find a significant three-way interaction effect between the two suggested capabilities and slack on innovation, and support that innovation mediates the influence between capabilities and performance. As such, we find evidence that externally oriented capabilities in conjuncture with organizational slack are important for the level of firm innovation, and that their influence on renewal through innovation also help determine future performance.

In Mexico, coffee production is considered as a <b>key</b> <b>strategic</b> <b>activity,</b> because it allows the integration of productive chains, generating foreign exchange and jobs, the livelihood of many small producers and around 30 indigenous groups and, recently, of great ecological significance, as more than 90. 0 % of the area cultivated with coffee is under diversified shade, which helps to preserve biodiversity and vital as a provider of environmental services to society. Despite its importance, the coffee sector has been involved in recurrent crises by falling prices in the international market. Organic coffee and fair trade are alternatives to continue to use coffee as an axis of community and regional development. This production will have a far greater potential to trigger or enroll in broader rural development processes (Palomares, et. al., 2012). Coffee is a growing social and economic importance to Mexico. Coffee production has great relevance for the country, a fact reflected in the following: 349, 701 production units (UP), according to the Census, 509, 817 producers as FC; 680, 000 hectares planted with this species where they work 486. 339 heads of families, an average production of 4. 7 million bags of 60 kilograms; sixth largest producer and second in organic production, after Peru; It generated 4. 5 million jobs, and is produced in 960 municipalities, although it is important only 236 of them in 15 states of Mexico (INEGI, 2007). Based on the above, the objective of the study was to analyze the importance of the marketing of coffee in Mexico. According to Robles (2011), any coffee promotion policy must necessarily be associated with a policy that considers both forms of organization such as the needs and concerns of indigenous peoples. That is, the policy of promoting coffee must be linked to the needs and concerns of the indigenous population, otherwise, will not have positive results...|$|E

Statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and other sources indicate that SMEs now account for a very substantial proportion of exports from most industrialized nations. But very little is known about the effect of having an international entrepreneurial orientation, or the role of specific strategies associated with this construct, on the foreign performance of such firms. Using data from an empirical study of SMEs, we devise a structural model that reveals the role of international entrepreneurial orientation, <b>key</b> <b>strategic</b> <b>activities,</b> and the collective effect of these constructs on the international performance of the modern, international SME. These findings and their implications for scholars and managers are discussed. International entrepreneurial orientation Strategy SME Empirical study...|$|R

Although it suffers criticism as a marketing tactic by MNCs and local business organisations, CSR activities, if executed properly, can improve socio-economic and political conditions in the host countries. This paper presents business practices and CSR lesson learnt from MNCs and local corporations operating in Vietnam and Lao PDR. The data is collected from secondary sources including key journals in business ethics, development, and international business, corporate reports and policy briefs. The researcher performed a between-study literature analysis in order to understand progress of CSR in Vietnam and Lao PDR. The status of research on the management of CSR as well as practices by business organizations are discussed in this paper. This paper also argues that, due to cultural and political climates in both countries, CSR actions must be seen {{as a response to the}} local needs.

5000|$|In recent decades, globalization, outsourcing, and {{information}} technology have enabled many organizations, such as Dell and Hewlett Packard, to successfully operate collaborative supply networks in which each specialized business partner focuses on only a few <b>key</b> <b>strategic</b> <b>activities</b> (Scott, 1993). This inter-organisational supply network can be acknowledged as {{a new form of}} organisation. However, with the complicated interactions among the players, the network structure fits neither [...] "market" [...] nor [...] "hierarchy" [...] categories (Powell, 1990). It is not clear what kind of performance impacts different supply network structures could have on firms, and {{little is known about the}} coordination conditions and trade-offs that may exist among the players. From a systems perspective, a complex network structure can be decomposed into individual component firms (Zhang and Dilts, 2004). Traditionally, companies in a supply network concentrate on the inputs and outputs of the processes, with little concern for the internal management working of other individual players. Therefore, the choice of an internal management control structure is known to impact local firm performance (Mintzberg, 1979).|$|R
40|$|One of Malaysia‚Äôs {{economic}} {{goals is}} to become an education hub for the region. To achieve this, the Malaysian government had liberalised government policies resulting in the proliferation of Private Higher Education Institutions (PHEIs) including private Universities and University Colleges. As competition intensifies it becomes increasingly pertinent to ask ‚ÄúWhat sustainable competitive advantage should the Private Higher Education Institutions (PHEIs) have to achieve market leadership in the Malaysian education industry?‚Äù For the smaller PHEIs, {{it is a question}} of survival itself. This paper aims to provide a theoretical study of some of the <b>key</b> <b>strategic</b> <b>activities</b> of the leading PHEIs to answer this question. The literature review covering both foreign and local sources indicates three key factors of sustainable competitive advantage, i. e. branding and image, the physical aspects of higher education including location and facilities, and the mode of delivery. The paper will seek to identify these factors amongst the market leaders to ascertain the validity of the secondary data via critical analysis of their activities. The theoretical framework employed for the analysis will be Michael Porter‚Äôs Three Generic Strategies and Five Competitive Forces.

40|$|Abstract: Despite {{criticism}} that the marketing discipline has a diminished role and influence within academia and business, there is general agreement that strategic marketing practice could contribute to company performance. The {{focus of this article}} is on how South African companies implement <b>key</b> <b>strategic</b> marketing concepts in order to establish a pattern of organisational behaviour around strategic marketing practice. The perceived contribution of these practices on company performance is also established. The South African perspective provides new insight into the practice and compliance of marketers within the context of developing countries. Insight of 167 South African marketing executives, obtained by means of a quantitative survey, suggests that although most firms performed <b>strategic</b> marketing <b>activities,</b> they were less confident that they established a competitive advantage or customer insight from doing so. The relative importance of customer insight was demonstrated {{by the fact that it}} had a significant correlation with financial performance, whereas segment-based marketing activities did not.

30|$|Observing the {{heterogeneity}} of accounting change at the outset, the contextual analysis used sub-structuring as a technique to arrange the cases regarding the extent of ‚Äòcorporate‚Äô accounting change (Miles and Huberman 1994 : 184). Data according to concepts describing the strategic behavior were collected through interviews with key informants, conducted {{at the end of}} the initiation period (2001, project managers, n¬†=¬† 6) and supplemented by public and internal archival documents. A set of semi-structured questionnaires were designed to advise the interviews according to relevant context issue and the specific content (e.g., context, accounting change, HRM), especially since comparability is an important issue of cross-case analysis. For example, to be able to assess a state of accounting change based on the measures outlined in Table¬† 3 in Appendix, each interview conducts ‚Äòsingle-item‚Äô questions covering the comprehensive decision-making criteria (e.g., prospected benefits, scope of accounting change interventions) and, contrastingly, examples of actual changes of accounting and HR practices. Supplementary questions were posed to identify the relevance of legal rules and (<b>key)</b> stakeholders, intended (<b>strategic)</b> <b>activities</b> and also the accounting change interventions currently in place (more detailed information is available from the author). This enabled a criteria-based approach (Bruns 2013; Gratton 1999) to assessing ‚Äòcorporate‚Äô accounting change, especially to secure that comparing assessment results was based on a consistent categorization scheme. Similar procedures were developed to assess the state of HRD, which is further outlined in the Sect. 5. Documents (including, for instance, the NKF-project proposals, plans, and annual reports, the council orders minutes and documents, published official documents) also provided a valuable primary source of data, especially to cross-check interviews and to check for retrospective bias.|$|R
