It seems unlikely, however, that any members of the trade delegation were spies. Nor <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> likely that Genghis was trying to initiate a conflict with the Khwarezmid Empire with the caravan, considering he was making steady progress against a faltering Jin empire in northern China at that very moment.|$|E

500|$|The film's {{tone and}} {{narrative}} style received mixed {{response from the}} critics. Ronnie Scheib at Variety {{found it to be}} filled with excessive pathos, [...] "shuttling between the trite and the sublime", while Odile Tremblay (Le Monde) said in contrary that the film avoided excessive pathos, rendering it funny and tragic at the same time, an observation that was supported by Jacques Mandelbaum at Le Devoir, who wrote that the film mixes humour, sensitivity and drama. Hammer to Nails review by Michael Nordine asserted that the film is [...] "neither a pity party nor an emotionally manipulative attempt", but a straightforward portrayal of things as they were, citing Gatlif's portrayal of the Romani as [...] "certainly sympathetic, but at no point <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> overly so." [...] The film provided insufficient analysis on the [...] "anti-roaming laws" [...] and their targeting of the Romani, observed [...] the reviewer, to whom the Nazi and all other anti-Romani characters in the film came across as [...] "one dimensional bigots". Bob Hill (Moving Pictures Network) criticised that the film failed to strike an emotional chord, unlike other movies and books with a similar theme. He conceded it to be an [...] "important, but not a great movie—or even a particularly good one, for that matter." [...] For a casual movie goer, he stated, [...] "Korkoro feels like a slow burn, lagging on long after most of the audience has long since called it quits". In defence of the film's incoherent narrative style, Jr Glenn Heath at Slant Magazine explained that Gatlif intended it less as a historical drama and more as evoking the sense of a memory, imbibing the stream of consciousness techniques. Commenting on its tone, he wrote that [...] "Korkoro is a reserved but lasting examination of collectively silent horror". At L'Express, Sophie Benamon declared that with the film's controlled pace, it keeps its viewers breathless and induces emotion. Alexis Campion at Le Journal du Dimanche stated that the film transcends the stereotypes while the reviewer at Arizona Reporter noted that some might consider it to be stereotyping the Romani.|$|E
2500|$|The {{chaperon}} {{never became}} quite this dominant in Italy or France; nor <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> {{to have been}} worn as often by grand personages, although this is sometimes the case. [...] There is a famous bust of Lorenzo de Medici wearing one, although in this he may be deliberately avoiding ostentatious dress (see gallery section). [...] They are more characteristic of merchants and lawyers in these countries, for example in the images of Jean Fouquet from the mid-century. In England, on the other hand, almost all the non-royal members of the Order of the Garter are shown wearing them in their portraits in the [...] "Bruges Garter Book" [...] of 1430–1440 (British Library, MS Stowe 594). In the Holy Roman Empire, Spain and Portugal they were generally less common, & appeared lower down the social scale. They were apparently never worn by the clergy anywhere.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011 Douglas E. Streusand {{criticized the}} Hodgson-McNeill Gunpowder-Empire hypothesis, calling it into disfavor as a neither [...] "adequate or accurate" [...] explanation, {{although}} the term remains in use. [...] The main {{problem with the}} Hodgson-McNeill {{theory is that the}} acquisition of firearms {{does not seem to have}} preceded the initial acquisition of territory constituting the imperial critical mass of any of the three early modern Islamic empires, except in the case of the Mughals. Moreover, it seems that the commitment to military autocratic rule pre-dated the acquisition of gunpowder weapons in all three cases. Reasons other than (or in addition to) military technology have been offered for the nearly simultaneous rise of three centralized military empires in contiguous areas dominated by decentralized Turkic tribes. One explanation, called [...] "Confessionalization" [...] by historians of fifteenth century Europe, invokes examination of how the relation of church and state [...] "mediated through confessional statements and church ordinances" [...] lead to the origins of absolutist polities. Douglas Streusand uses the Safavids as an example: The Safavids from the beginning imposed a new religious identity on their general population; they did not seek to develop a national or linguistic identity, but their policy had that effect. Nor <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> to be the case that the acquisition of gunpowder weapons and their integration into the military was influenced by considerations of whichever variety of Islam the particular empire promoted. Whether or not gunpowder was inherently linked to the existence of any of these three empires, it cannot be questioned that each of the three acquired artillery and firearms early in their history and made such weapons an integral part of their military tactics.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{before its}} release, Sacred Evil– A True Story faced a {{petition}} which challenged the Censor Board's decision to grant an exhibition certificate to the film. The petition, filed by lawyer Gerry Coelho, contended that granting the certificate to the film, was unethical and indecent {{on the part}} of the Censor Board of India and constituted total non-application of mind. The objections raised by Coelho were based on the film's posters and promotional advertisements. The Censor Board said that they had not been insensitive to Christian sentiments. [...] "We are very careful when we screen sensitive movies [...] But, there is nothing in the movie that is objectionable, or will hurt the sentiments of the community in question." [...] The film was given green signal by the censor board, but was still postponed because of non-availability of theatres. It was finally released on 23 June 2006, and was a commercial disappointment but received mixed reviews from critics. Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama commented: [...] "Sacred Evil is a pleasant change and a break from the monotony of the regular Hindi films. However, the subject is one that caters to a niche audience only. However, the fact cannot be denied that the narrative does not go off-track nor <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> as if some sequences have been incorporated for the sake of it. Despite its slow pacing, Sacred Evil has the knack to hold the interest of its viewer. It's definitely a fine effort by directors Abiyaan Rajhans and Abhigyan Jha. The performances are above average, with Sarika dominating the show." [...] Deepali Singh from The Kolkata Telegraph gave the film three out of ten, stating [...] "If one hopes to discover the secrets of Wiccan ways in Sacred Evil, directed by Abiyaan Rajhans and Abhigyan Jha, one is in for a major disappointment. Beyond a candlelit session, which doesn't really lead anywhere except to a few flickers of vague shadows in the background, the story just about treads into the Wiccan world. [...] Sarika, as Ipsita, ghost walks through another expressionless comeback." ...|$|E
