She asked Hollywood special effects professional Robin Hollister what he would recommend, and introduced him to Leakey.

A friendship developed, but there was no romance. The firm had a large and profitable business, and as the biographer R W Davis observes, the clerkship was [...] "the kind of secure, respectable position that many fathers dream of for their children". Although biographers including Robert Blake and Bradford comment that such a post was incompatible with Disraeli's romantic and ambitious nature, he reportedly gave his employers satisfactory service, and later professed to have learned a good deal from his time with the firm. He recalled, [...] "I had some scruples, for even then <b>I</b> <b>dreamed</b> of Parliament. My father's refrain always was 'Philip Carteret Webb', who was the most eminent solicitor of his boyhood and who was an MP. It {{would be a mistake to}} suppose that the two years and more that I was in the office of our friend were wasted.

[...] She described Disney movies as [...] "the ones [...] watched over and over again when [...] was a kid," [...] and continued, [...] "I knew every line from The Little Mermaid. I love Aladdin. When asked about her favorite Disney character, Bell said, [...] "Ariel from The Little Mermaid. Because I think it was a shift that Disney had, where a female lead—the [...] "princess," [...] I guess—didn't just want to find her mate. She was singing [...] "I want to be where the people are. I want to see the world. I want to venture outside my comfort zone."" [...] Bell described her initial reaction when she first found that she was cast as [...] "I was in glee". Lee admitted Bell's casting selection was influenced after the filmmakers listened a couple of vocal tracks from The Little Mermaid, including [...] "Part of Your World" [...] that the actress recorded when she was young, stating that without these recordings, it would've been very difficult to the find the right one to play Anna.|$|E
