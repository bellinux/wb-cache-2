Micromanometric pressure recordings were synchronized with cineangiograms during mechanical CPR in 17 dogs with induced ventricular fibrillation. Chest compression produced equivalent pressure increases in the aorta (Ao) and right atrium (RA) (Ao 32 + 14 mm Hg, RA 30 ± 14 mm Hg; NS), a linear relationship between aortic and <b>intrapleural</b> <b>pressures</b> (r = 0. 87, p < 0. 001) {{over a wide range}} of induced pressures, cine-angiographic blood flow through both left-heart chambers, and a pressure gradient (21 ± 14 mm Hg) between all intrathoracic cardiovascular compartments and the jugular veins that resulted from closure of venous valves at the thoracic inlets. Simultaneous chest compression and lung inflation significantly increased all intra-thoracic vascular pressures, the aortojugular venous gradient (42 ± 13 mm Hg,p < 0. 05 vs chest compression alone), electromagnetically determined carotid arterial blood flow (1. 75 ± 0. 81 ml/min/kg vs 0. 51 ± 0. 27 mI/min/kg during chest compression alone, p < 0. 005), and angiographic left-heart flow.

Bedside ultrasound of the inferior vena cava (IVC) has grown {{to be an important}} tool in the assessment and management of critically ill patients. This study endeavors to examine which location along the IVC is most highly correlated with changes in intravascular volume status: (1) the diaphragmatic juncture (DJ) (2) two centimeters caudal to the hepatic vein juncture (2 HVJ) or (3) left renal vein juncture (LRVJ). Data was collected in this prospective observational study on patients in the emergency department who were at least 16 years of age, being treated with intravenous fluids (IVF). Measurements of the IVC were recorded at each site during standard inspiratory and expiratory cycles, and again with the patient actively sniffing to decrease <b>intrapleural</b> <b>pressures.</b> IVF was then administered per the patient’s predetermined treatment, and the same six measurements were repeated after completion of fluid bolus. The difference in caval index (dCI) was calculated for all six data sets and correlated with the mL/kg of IVF administered. There was a statistically significant correlation between mL/kg of IVFs administered and dCI at all three sites (DJ: r = 0. 354, p value = 0. 0002; 2 HVJ: r = 0. 334, p value = 0. 0003; LRVJ: r = 0. 192, p value = 0. 03). The greatest correlation between amount of fluids administered and dCI was observed along the IVC at the site 2 cm caudal to the juncture of the hepatic veins (2 HVJ). This site is also where the largest change in diameter can be appreciated on ultrasound during intravascular volume resuscitation. Our data also suggests that every mL/kg of IVFs administered should change the dCI by 0. 86 - 1. 00 %.

40|$|European Journal of Cardio-thoracic SuBackground and objective: To our knowledge, {{no reports}} have been {{published}} describing the effect of suction on pleural pressures after different types of lobectomy. Improving knowledge of pleural physiology in the postoperative period could lead to better postoperative care. The aim of this investigation is to evaluate the effect of postoperative suction on inspiratory, expiratory and differential pleural pressures after upper or lower lobectomy. Methods: Records of <b>intrapleural</b> <b>pressures</b> from 24 lobectomy patients (operated on in two different institutions) were selected for study. All patients had normal preoperative pulmonary function tests (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) > 80 % and forced vital capacity (FVC) /FEV 1 > 70 %), and neither postoperative air leak nor any other postoperative complication. We selected six cases of each type of lobectomy (right upper lobectomy (RUL), right lower lobectomy (RLL), left upper lobectomy (LUL) and left lower lobectomy (LLL)). In three cases of each group, no suction was indicated, while in the other three cases, chest tubes were placed under 15 cmH 2 O suction, according to the standard local perioperative care protocol in each participating centre. Inspiratory and expiratory pleural pressures were measured at 2 -min intervals by an electronic device using a DigiVentW (Millicore A. B., Sweden) suction chamber. Recording started 5 — 10 h after closing the chest, and included 5 consecutive hours during the first postoperative night, with the patients at rest in 30 — 458 sitting position. Therewas no evidence of pneumothorax during the recording time. The influence of lobectomy site (upper or lower) and suction on inspiratory, expiratory and differential pressures were evaluated by Student’s t-tests. Results: In the group of cases under no suction, upper lobectomy patients had larger differential pressures (22. 6 in upper vs 11. 5 cmH 2 O in lower lobectomy cases, p < 0. 001), differential pressure decreased in patients under suction (9. 1 in upper vs 11. 1 cmH 2 O in lower lobectomy cases, p < 0. 001) and the effect was mainly due to a less negative inspiratory pressure.

It has been hypothesized that EIPH is detrimental to performance and this was recently confirmed by Hinchcliff et al. in 2004. EIPH is a complex multi-factorial condition with much still unknown about the etiology, best method for diagnosis, and most effective form of treatment. Chapter one of this dissertation determined the effectiveness of a novel treatment, concentrated equine serum, in ameliorating EIPH via reduction of IAD. Chapter two refuted the hypothesis that herbal formulations commonly used in the field with anecdotal success would decrease EIPH by correcting coagulation deficits during exercise, as scientific efficacy was not evident, at least at the dose and duration used in our investigation. Chapter three addressed the dogma that EIPH only occurs during maximal intensity exercise, and in demonstrating significant EIPH during sub-maximal exercise, emphasized the role that the airways play in contributing to the initiation and severity of EIPH. Chapter four examined the occurrence and severity of EIPH in the horse’s canine counterpart, the racing Greyhound. The demonstrated presence of mild EIPH in the Greyhound, a physiologically similar yet different athlete in comparison to the horse sheds new light on the etiology of this condition in both species. The results of these investigations have advanced the frontiers of our knowledge concerning EIPH. Specifically, they have generated novel information on the mechanistic bases of EIPH and have provided evidence supporting additional treatment options for reducing the severity of EIPH in horses...|$|R

Risk factors for development of postlaryngospasm pulmonary edema include difficult intubation; nasal, oral, or pharyngeal surgical site; and obesity with obstructive apnea. The syndrome is recognized by development of hypoxia shortly (1 - 90 min) after a laryngospasm. A chest radiograph will reveal a symmetric bilateral infiltrate with normal heart size.

5000|$|... ==Physiology== Since {{atmospheric}} pressure is relatively constant, {{pressure in the}} lungs must be higher or lower than {{atmospheric pressure}} for air to flow between the atmosphere and the alveoli. If 'transpulmonary pressure' = 0 (alveolar pressure = <b>intrapleural</b> <b>pressure),</b> such as when the lungs are removed from the chest cavity or air enters the intrapleural space (a pneumothorax), the lungs collapse {{as a result of}} their inherent elastic recoil. Under physiological conditions the transpulmonary pressure is always positive; <b>intrapleural</b> <b>pressure</b> is always negative and relatively large, while alveolar pressure moves from slightly negative to slightly positive as a person breathes. For a given lung volume the transpulmonary pressure is equal and opposite to the elastic recoil pressure of the lung.|$|E
50|$|Pneumothorax ex vacuo {{is a rare}} type of {{pneumothorax}} {{which forms}} adjacent to an atelectatic lobe.

50|$|During inspiration, <b>intrapleural</b> <b>pressure</b> {{decreases}} {{by up to}} 4 mm Hg, which distends {{the right}} atrium, allowing for faster filling from the vena cava, increasing ventricular preload, but decreasing stroke volume. Conversely during expiration, the heart is compressed, decreasing cardiac efficiency and increasing stroke volume.

50|$|Respiration {{affects the}} cardiac cycle by varying the <b>intrapleural</b> <b>{{pressure}},</b> the pressure between the thoracic {{wall and the}} lungs.

5000|$|... #Caption: Lung-on-a-chip - The device {{consists}} of three hollow microchannels, and only the middle channel contains a horizontal porous membrane, coated on either side by either an endothelium or an epithelium tissue. The side channels are connected to a vacuum and can therefore simulate the stretching of the membrane. The contraction of the diaphragm triggers the <b>intrapleural</b> <b>pressure</b> to decrease, leading to an expansion of alveoli. This is the phenomenon essentially mimicked by this lung-on-a-chip.|$|E
50|$|External suction (previously {{referred}} to as active suction) is {{used to create a}} sub-atmospheric pressure at the tip of a catheter. As the atmospheric pressure is lower compared to the <b>intrapleural</b> <b>pressure,</b> the lack of external suction (which was previously {{referred to}} as passive suction) is used to drain air and fluids. Traditional drainage systems are not able to suction sub-atmospheric pressure in the pleural space. These systems only allow for a regulation of pressure via the system itself but cannot regulate sub-atmospheric pressure in the pleural space.|$|E
50|$|The {{compartmentalization}} of {{the channels}} facilitates {{not only the}} flow of air as a fluid which delivers cells and nutrients to the apical surface of the epithelium, but also allows for pressure differences to exist between the middle and side channels. During normal inspiration in a human’s respiratory cycle, <b>intrapleural</b> <b>pressure</b> decreases, triggering {{an expansion of the}} alveoli. As air is pulled into the lungs, alveolar epithelium and the coupled endothelium in the capillaries are stretched. Since a vacuum is connected to the side channels, a decrease in pressure will cause the middle channel to expand, thus stretching the porous membrane and subsequently, the entire alveolar-capillary interface. The pressure-driven dynamic motion behind the stretching of the membrane, also described as a cyclic mechanical strain (valued at approximately 10%), significantly increases the rate of nanoparticle translocation across the porous membrane, when compared to a static version of this device, and to a Transwell culture system.|$|E
50|$|This {{phenomenon}} {{occurs because}} of the elastin in the elastic fibers in the connective tissue of the lungs, and {{because of the}} surface tension of the film of fluid that lines the alveoli. As water molecules pull together, they also pull on the alveolar walls causing the alveoli to recoil and become smaller. But two factors prevent the lungs from collapsing: surfactant and the <b>intrapleural</b> <b>pressure.</b> Surfactant is a surface-active lipoprotein complex formed by type II alveolar cells. The proteins and lipids that comprise surfactant have both a hydrophilic region and a hydrophobic region. By absorbing to the air-water interface of alveoli with the hydrophilic head groups in the water and the hydrophobic tails facing towards the air, the main lipid component of surfactant, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, reduces surface tension. It also means the rate of shrinking is more regular because of the stability of surface area caused by surfactant. Pleural pressure is the pressure in the pleural space. When this pressure is lower than the pressure of alveoli they tend to expand. This prevents the elastic fibers and outside pressure from crushing the lungs. It is a homeostatic mechanism.|$|E

ParticipantsSeven experienced cardiopulmonary physiotherapists and three healthy adults. InterventionVibration (compression + oscillation), compression alone, and oscillation alone were applied manually to the chest walls of healthy participants during passive exertion and compared with passive expiration alone. Outcome measuresChest wall force, chest wall circumference, <b>intrapleural</b> <b>pressure,</b> and expiratory flow rate. ResultsDuring vibration, coherence was high (r 2 > 0. 97) between external chest wall force, chest wall circumference, <b>intrapleural</b> <b>pressure,</b> and expiratory flow. The mean change in <b>intrapleural</b> <b>pressure</b> during vibration was 9. 55 cmH 2 O (SD 1. 66), during chest compression alone was 8. 06 cmH 2 O (SD 1. 65), during oscillation alone was 7. 93 cmH 2 O (SD 1. 57), and during passive expiration alone was 6. 82 cmH 2 O (SD 1. 51).
