The lane is {{reputed to be}} the {{territory}} of the Lantern man who lure’s all travellers to their doom. The parish church of Southrepps is called St James. Note the corbel’s and gargoyle’s high up on this church. At this point <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> to visit the church and village you must walk south into the village and then retrace your footsteps back to rejoin the Paston Way.|$|E
25|$|Two images Henri Bergson gave in {{his essay}} An Introduction to Metaphysics may aid us in comprehending the ideas of intuition, analyses, the {{absolute}} and the relative. The first image is a city reconstructed with juxtaposed photographs taken from every viewpoint and angle. The reconstruction can never give us the dimensional value of walking through the actual city. This can only ever be grasped through a simple intuition. The {{same goes for the}} experience of reading a single line of Homer. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> to explain this experience to someone who cannot speak ancient Greek, you may translate the line and lay commentary upon commentary, but this commentary shall never grasp the dimensional value of experiencing the poem in its original language.|$|E
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> you {{may tell}} the police {{to be careful not}} to rile me. Of course, I am a {{reasonable}} spirit. I take no offense at the way they have conducted their investigations in the past. In fact, they have been so utterly stupid as to not only amuse me, but His Satanic Majesty, Francis Josef, etc. But tell them to beware. Let them not try to discover what I am, for it were better that they were never born than to incur the wrath of the Axeman. I don't think there is any need of such a warning, for I feel sure the police will always dodge me, as they have in the past. They are wise and know how to keep away from all harm.|$|E

500|$|On 2 April, Spector sent {{each of the}} Beatles an acetate of the {{completed}} album with a note saying: [...] "If there is anything you'd like done to the album, let me know and I'll be glad to help … <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish,</b> please call me about anything regarding the album tonight."

500|$|However, Piłsudski {{believed}} that {{as head of}} state he must be above partisan politics. The day after his arrival in Warsaw, he met with old colleagues from underground days, who addressed him socialist-style as [...] "Comrade" [...] ("Towarzysz") and asked his support for their revolutionary policies; he refused it and answered: [...] "Comrades, I took the red streetcar of socialism to the stop called Independence, and that's where I got off. You may keep on to the final stop <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish,</b> but from now on let's address each other as 'Mister' !" [...] He declined to support any one party and did not form any political organization of his own; instead, he advocated creating a coalition government. He also set about organizing a Polish army out of Polish veterans of the German, Russian and Austrian armies.|$|E

2500|$|Chandler, {{who is from}} Ontario, but {{moved to}} Alberta by choice in 1995, caused {{controversy}} in August 2007 for comments stating, [...] "You came to here to enjoy our economy, our natural beauty and more.

2500|$|While {{in prison}} later in life, Hardin {{wrote in his}} {{autobiography}} which is the source for many stories about him. However, he was well known for wildly exaggerating or completely making up stories about his life. In several of his stories, {{he claimed to have}} been involved in events which cannot be confirmed. For example, Hardin wrote that he was first exposed to violence in 1861 when he saw a man named Turner Evans stabbed by John Ruff. Evans died of his injuries and Ruff was jailed. Hardin wrote, [...] "...Readers you see what drink and passion will do. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> to be successful in life, be temperate and control your passions; if you don't, ruin and death is the result." ...|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, Smith had {{dispatched}} Colonel John Scott to {{look for}} Bragg. On the night of September 13, Scott encountered John T. Wilder at Munfordville, and demanded his surrender. Scott requested the aid of James Chalmers' Mississippi brigade, which moved to support Scott throughout the night. The assault commenced the next morning, and though outnumbered, Scott's forces inflicted more than 200 casualties in the early fighting. At 9:30 AM, Chalmers tried to intimidate Wilder into surrender, sending a flag of truce with the message, [...] "You have made a gallant defense of your position, and to avoid further bloodshed I demand an unconditional surrender of your forces. I have six regiments of infantry, one battalion of infantry sharpshooters, and have just been reinforced by a brigade of cavalry, under Colonel Scott, with two battalions of infantry." [...] Upon receiving this message, Wilder replied [...] "Thank you for your compliments. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> to avoid further bloodshed, keep {{out of the reach}} of my guns." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “The Honorable Elijah Muhammad {{said these}} planes {{were used to}} set up {{mountains}} on the earth. The Qur'an says it like this: We have raised mountains on the earth lest it convulse with you. How do you raise a mountain, {{and what is the}} purpose of a mountain? Have you ever tried to balance a tire? You use weights to keep the tire balanced. That's how the earth is balanced, with mountain ranges. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad said that we have a type of bomb that, when it strikes the earth a drill on it is timed to go into the earth and explode at the height that you wish the mountain to be. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> to take the mountain up a mile (1.6 km), you time the drill to go a mile (1.6 km) in and then explode. The bombs these planes have are timed to go one mile (1.6 km) down and bring up a mountain one mile (1.6 km) high, but it will destroy everything within a 50-square-mile (130 km²) radius.

2500|$|Finally, {{the release}} of the 2nd Edition rules further complicates the process by making some {{sections}} of the 1st Edition obsolete. [...] Full compatibility with 2nd Edition rules is only possible by owning the 2nd Edition. [...] This forces some players to purchase the ASLRB all over again. [...] An area the new rules simplifies is the Chapters included in various Modules. [...] Originally a new module would add a new chapter to the ASLRB to cover the new material. [...] For instance, {{the release of}} Yanks included special rules in a Chapter E and a chapter detailing the American OOB. [...] Any players wishing to use these rules in a following Module would also have to own Yanks. [...] The 2nd Edition helps to alleviate this problem by supplying more rules in one binder. [...] It still does not supply all rules for all situations. [...] For instance <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> to play a scenario using Jungle terrain you will need the Code of Bushido module with its rules section. [...] Also, the OOB of particular nationalities and the map boards from particular Modules may still be required for subsequent Modules.|$|E
