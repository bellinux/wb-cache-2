40|$|The paper {{examines}} the possibility <b>of</b> <b>hydraulic</b> characterization <b>of</b> radial <b>well</b> laterals {{in a manner}} that does not require prior hydrodynamic analysis by simulating groundwater extraction conditions on a numerical model. The first step of the proposed approach is to assess the groundwater level regime formed in the capture zone when the well is operating, which is indicative of the functional condition of the laterals and the aquifer potential in terms of groundwater availability. Then the efficiency of the laterals is examined through the <b>hydraulic</b> function <b>of</b> the skin zone, depending on its filtration properties. An expression for groundwater flow from the aquifer to the laterals (commonly used to simulate laterals on a hydrodynamic model) is employed to define representative values of the conductance coefficient of the skin zone (as an indicator of colmation), and then applied to several wells at Belgrade Groundwater Source. The present research shows that a conductance coefficient of [Ks/ds]= 1. 0 × 10 - 4 s- 1 can be considered as the threshold value in relation to which the effects <b>of</b> colmation <b>of</b> <b>well</b> laterals are exhibited, which is consistent with the results reported by researchers who studied the effect of skin zone conductance on the occurrence and nature of the so-called early drawdown at radial collector wells. In addition to gaining insight into the present condition of the laterals, the proposed approach can be used to study the progress of colmation at different points in time and to quantify the effectiveness of regeneration of laterals.

30|$|Multi-stage <b>hydraulic</b> {{fracturing}} <b>of</b> horizontal <b>wells</b> is {{the main}} stimulation method in recovering gas from tight shale gas reservoirs, and stage spacing determination {{is one of the}} key issues in fracturing design. The initiation and propagation <b>of</b> <b>hydraulic</b> fractures will cause stress redistribution and may activate natural fractures in the reservoir. Due to the limitation of the analytical method in calculation of induced stresses, we propose a numerical method, which incorporates the interaction <b>of</b> <b>hydraulic</b> fractures and the wellbore, and analyzes the stress distribution in the reservoir under different stage spacing. Simulation results indicate the following: (1) The induced stress was overestimated from the analytical method because it did not take into account the interaction between hydraulic fractures and the horizontal wellbore. (2) The hydraulic fracture had a considerable effect on the redistribution of stresses in the direction of the horizontal wellbore in the reservoir. The stress in the direction perpendicular to the horizontal wellbore after hydraulic fracturing had a minor change compared with the original in situ stress. (3) Stress interferences among fractures were greatly connected with the stage spacing and the distance from the wellbore. When the fracture length was 200  m, and the stage spacing was 50  m, the stress redistribution due to stage fracturing may divert the original stress pattern, which might activate natural fractures so as to generate a complex fracture network.|$|R

5000|$|Prior to the 1970s, {{collection}} of discrete groundwater samples from multiple depths in the subsurface required the installation <b>of</b> <b>well</b> clusters or nested wells [...] <b>Well</b> clusters consist <b>of</b> a closely spaced group <b>of</b> monitoring <b>wells,</b> each well completed {{to a different}} depth in individual boreholes. Well clusters were first used in the 1950s at contaminated sites. Because {{there is only one}} well screen in each borehole, there is little risk of vertical connection between zones. The individual wells in the cluster must be installed near one another (e.g., ≤10 ft. apart), so that the head data obtained from them is a result of variations in the vertical head and not horizontal gradients. Also, care must be taken to avoid installing clusters <b>of</b> <b>wells</b> with overlapping screens and sand packs - this may allow vertical movement of contamination between the wells in the presence <b>of</b> vertical <b>hydraulic</b> gradients. Installation <b>of</b> <b>wells</b> clusters can be expensive because of increased drilling costs associated with drilling multiple borings, especially in fractured rock. [...] Nested wells are <b>wells</b> constructed <b>of</b> two or more well screens and casing assemblies of different lengths installed in a single borehole. The key drawback <b>of</b> nested <b>wells</b> is that {{it can be difficult to}} effectively seal the portions of the borehole between the monitored zones. Nested wells were popular in the 1970s but many seal failures occurred. For this reason, nested wells are discouraged or prohibited in many areas. [...] There are typically three separate monitoring intervals in nested wells, although more monitoring intervals have been constructed in very deep monitoring <b>wells.</b> The risk <b>of</b> hydraulically connecting the various monitoring zones is inversely proportional to the thickness of the seals between the monitoring intervals. Thus, shallow nested wells with many monitoring zones are more at risk <b>of</b> <b>hydraulic</b> failure than deep nested wells with fewer monitoring zones.|$|R

This stimulation {{will be carried out}} at depths of ~ 3000 to 3500 ft in units comprised of silicified rhyolite tuffs and metamorphosed mudstones at ambient temperatures of ~ 180 to 195 ° C. Our previous analyses of borehole image logs from this well showed that the current minimum horizontal principal stress, Shmin, is oriented 114 ± 17 º and that numerous fractures in the planned stimulation interval are optimally oriented for normal faulting. As an extension of this earlier work, a hydraulic fracturing stress measurement was conducted {{at the top of the}} intended stimulation interval and indicates that the magnitude of Shmin is 1995 ± 60 psi, which is ~ 0. 61 of the calculated vertical (overburden) stress at this depth. This Shmin magnitude is somewhat higher than expected for frictional failure on optimally oriented normal faults under current reservoir pressures given typical laboratory measurements of sliding friction (Byerlee’s Law). However, Coulomb failure calculations using coefficients of friction derived from laboratory tests on representative core samples from a nearby well (Lutz et al., 2010) indicate that shear failure could be induced on well-oriented preexisting fractures in well 27 - 15 once fluid pressures are increased by several hundred psi above the ambient formation fluid pressure.
