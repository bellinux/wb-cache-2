40|$|Field-theoretical {{methods have}} been shown to be useful in {{constructing}} simple effective theories for two-dimensional (2 D) systems. These effective theories are usually studied by perturbing around a mean-field approximation, so the question whether such an approximation is meaningful arises immediately. We here study 2 D interacting electrons in a half-filled Landau level mapped onto interacting hard-core bosons in a magnetic field. We argue that an interacting hard-core boson system in a uniform external field such that there is one flux quantum per particle (unit filling) exhibits an integer quantum Hall effect. As a consequence, the mean-field approximation for mapping electrons at half-filling to a boson system at integer <b>filling</b> <b>fails.</b> Comment: 13 pages latex with revtex.
