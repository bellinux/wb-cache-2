Although she quickly earns Amanda's respect, Tessa feels like she has to compete with Amanda, while Amanda comments that Tessa is [...] "...quite refreshing in a gauche sort of way." [...] Gracen played Amanda's interaction with Tessa ambiguously and a little flirtatiously. Tessa is usually jealous of MacLeod's past lovers, but acknowledges in [...] "" [...] that [...] "...it would take me several lifetimes to find out everything in Duncan's past.

With her marvellous brain she sharpened people's wits." [...] Her granddaughter thought her [...] "formidable, but never intimidating... a supremely honest woman, full of commonsense and modesty." [...] Victoria wrote her own typically forthright epitaph {{at the end}} of her life in letters to and conversation with her son: [...] "What will live in history is the good work done by the individual & that has nothing to do with rank or title... <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> would be known only as your mother.

Foster saw Inside Man as an opportunity to collaborate with Lee: [...] "Spike is somebody who always fascinated me, and I've loved his movies. I've always wanted to be involved in something he's making. Basically, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> would because it didn't seem like his stories or subject matter were ever going to include me. So, I'm just as excited as I can be." [...] She described her character as a woman with [...] "a relaxed kind of witty quality to her. All the while being very strong, not having to raise her voice very much, not having to yell at anybody — she's got authority. There's seductiveness, a charm, if you will, to her ability to get into people's psyches that's been immensely fun to play. It all went way too fast for me." ...|$|E
500|$|For the song, {{which is}} a baroque pop ballad, Madonna uses a {{contrast}} of timbre, her higher smoother voice with her lower one. The song begins {{with the sound of}} violins for about 20seconds. After this, a drum machine, string arrangement and piano ushers on top of the violins, as Madonna sings the chorus line [...] "You can't hurt me now, I got away from you, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> would." [...] The violins and the drum beats drop after the chorus, but come back again during the next bridge. As Madonna sings the verse [...] "Oh father I have sinned", the violins change their pitch to a higher one. After the second chorus, there is an instrumental break where she sings about the realization that her father did not want to hurt her but she still ran away. The song ends with the guitar and violins fading out with Madonna's voice. In an interview with Paul Zollo, Madonna commented that the [...] "Father" [...] can refer to Tony, God or all the [...] "authorities in her life".|$|E

He came on {{as a substitute for}} Maik Taylor on 76 minutes, conceding one goal scored by Lukas Podolski. On reflection of this match, Ingham said [...] "The reaction of the crowd when I came on was amazing. To be honest I was holding back the tears as <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> would get such a reception. I was the proudest man in the ground." [...] For this match, he was offered insurance by the IFA, due to him not yet being under contract at Wrexham. This appearance would result in a £30,000 payment for former club Cliftonville, which came {{as a part of the}} deal for Sunderland to sign him, but by August 2005 this had still to be received by the club. The Premier League was called into the situation by Cliftonville, as they had only received the first part of the payment after he made his first-team debut for Sunderland. Ingham himself was also due a £20,000 bonus for this appearance.|$|E

500|$|In 2005, Love {{was ordered}} into {{lockdown}} rehab by a California judge {{after a series}} of legal issues and controlled substance charges. After her release in 2006, she published a memoir, , and started recording what would become her second solo album, How Dirty Girls Get Clean, collaborating again with Perry and Smashing Pumpkins vocalist/guitarist Billy Corgan in the writing and recording. Love had written several songs, including an anti-cocaine song titled [...] "Loser Dust", during her time in rehab in 2005. She told Billboard: [...] "My hand-eye coordination was so bad , I didn't even know chords anymore. It was like my fingers were frozen. And I wasn't allowed to make noise ... <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> would work again." [...] Some tracks and demos from the album (initially planned for release in 2008) were leaked on the internet in 2006, and a documentary entitled The Return of Courtney Love, detailing the making of the album, aired on the British television network More4 in the fall of that year. A rough acoustic version of [...] "Never Go Hungry Again", recorded during an interview for The Times in November, was also released.

And a fan of what women are capable of balancing and achieving, by just being them." ...|$|E

[...] Russo admitted that such a proposition of breaking up between the two would have been celebrated in 1992. [...] However, Russo said in an interview, [...] "I think that, in the long term, the station sees us as a tandem and {{would not want to}} break the brand up... And to tell you the truth, after almost 20 years together, Mike and I are like a married couple: It would be too hard to leave him. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> would hear myself say this, but it would feel very strange to be on the air without him." ...|$|E

He also revealed {{that he was in the}} dark about whom Cowell had the intentions of bringing onto the panel. On 14 May 2015, Walsh confirmed his exit from the series, stating, [...] "The truth is I've done it for 11 years; <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> would even be on TV for four or five. To get 10 was great, to get 11 was amazing - I'm not hanging around for them this year."

2500|$|Her self-hatred {{accelerated}} into raging {{cycles of}} bulimia and anorexia, repressing the issue until questioned. Jackson said, [...] "people say to me: `Okay, you've {{got to start}} eating more. You're too thin.' But when {{you look in the}} mirror, you see something totally different." [...] She continued, [...] "I had swung so far in one direction, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> could swing so far in the other. You're losing weight and getting smaller, and I'd still say to myself I could afford to lose a little more". However, she refused professional guidance, reluctant to examination. She briefly saw a psychologist before an encounter with a spiritual guru, who aided her emotional recovery. Jackson recounted, [...] "we went to this very spiritual place in the desert... That's where I met him, this cowboy. He's in his fifties, and he's full of wisdom. He's an older man who has experienced a great deal, and he {{used to be in the}} music industry, on a smaller scale. He even understood that side of my life". She also began using coffee enemas to remove [...] "sad cells", leading to media scrutiny. The trauma lead to a brief duration of sexual questioning, saying [...] "Am I curious? I think every girl has wondered". Jackson culminated the experiences into the album's subject matter, recording over two years.|$|E
2500|$|AllMusic felt [...] "...the Soulful British crooner James Blunt's wistful debut infuses the {{listener}} – in order – with rainy-day hope, the wistful comfort of unattainable love, and finally, world-weary resignation. While his parched and effeminate falsetto recalls Gasoline Alley-era Rod Stewart {{with a healthy}} dose of Antony and the Johnsons, it's the late Elliott Smith who casts the largest shadow on Back to Bedlam." [...] Q magazine and Common Sense Media awarded the album four stars out of five. RocknWorld stated [...] "It's hard to describe James Blunt or his music without falling prey to many a cliché or hyperbole. Comes from the UK, serves in the army then makes an album of movingly sincere ballads which make a huge impression on his homeland and Australia, thus allowing him to enjoy phenomenal, chart topping success. However, in this case, the music Blunt is making does really deserve and warrant the hype surrounding him. Strangely enough, even with his music being all over the radio here in Australia, I cannot begrudge the fact that Blunt is truly talented and has made himself a damn good debut record." [...] BBC Collective said [...] "It's very rare I give an album 5 stars. Many have come close, but just missing it. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>i</b> would say this, but Back To Bedlam has not got one bad track on it. I've listened to it 3 times back to back, just to make sure." [...] Slant Magazine said, in a three and a half star review, that [...] "Bedlam is an overall raw listening experience" [...] and that though [...] "Blunt's writing often juxtaposes love with death" [...] that it's [...] "More reason for American girls to go gaga over this able British bloke." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2002, Torre and {{his wife}} Ali {{established}} the Joe Torre Safe at Home Foundation. In October 2007 the Foundation partnered with the Union City, New Jersey Board of Education and the North Hudson Community Action Corporation (NHCAC) to establish the Foundation's Margaret Place initiative at Union City, New Jersey's José Martí Middle School, with a $325,000 donation from Verizon. It continues to receive yearly funding from that company of up to $65,000. The Foundation's mission is to educate and prevent domestic violence. Margaret's Place is named after Torre's mother, who {{was a victim of}} verbal and physical abuse at the hands of Torre's New York City Police officer father when Torre was a child. Torre describes his father as a [...] "bully", and while Torre himself was not a target of his father's violence, he has related that he never felt safe at home, and grew up in fear for his mother, saying, [...] "I always felt responsible for it. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> belonged anywhere. I never felt safe except on the ball field." [...] Margaret's Place is a comprehensive program that provides students with a safe room in school where they can meet with a professional counselor trained in domestic violence intervention and prevention in order to address the student's home situation and educate them to understand domestic violence's impact on the community. The children are also given the opportunity to read, play games or talk about their experience with others. The program, which is administered by health care professionals from North Hudson Community Action Corp, also includes an anti-violence campaign within the school, and training for teachers and counselors. It has grown to 11 sites in the region, though Union City's is the only such program in New Jersey.|$|E
