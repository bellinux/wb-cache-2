5|$|The Germans had a {{fortified}} base, Stützpunkt Podglavica, near Podglavica in {{the village}} of Prkosi (between Vrtoče and Kulen Vakuf). The base, with about 500 members of the 373rd (Croatian) Infantry Division and an artillery battery, secured the roads from Petrovac to Bihać and Kulen Vakuf. In September 1943, the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 10th Krajina Brigade and a battalion of the Drvar–Petrovac Partisan Detachment were directed to attack it. Bursać volunteered to throw hand grenades at the pillboxes and machine-gun nests protecting the base. Although her company commander objected because she still appeared ill, Bursać insisted on throwing the grenades. The three Partisan battalions attacked the base from three directions on 18September at 11pm. Bursać and her group of grenade throwers destroyed several pillboxes before they came under fire from another. They destroyed the pillbox, but Bursać received a serious leg wound and was carried to a less <b>exposed</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E

25|$|With the {{increase}} of vitamin D synthesis, there is a decreased incidence of conditions {{that are related to}} common vitamin D deficiency conditions of people with dark skin pigmentation living in environments of low UV radition: rickets, osteoporosis, numerous cancer types (including colon and breast cancer), and immune system malfunctioning. Vitamin D promotes the production of cathelicidin, which helps to defend humans' bodies against fungal, bacterial, and viral infections, including flu. When exposed to UVB, the entire <b>exposed</b> <b>area</b> of body’s skin of a relatively light skinned person is able to between 10 - 20000 IU of vitamin D.|$|E
25|$|Once {{deadwood}} {{has been}} shaped to the designer's plan, the <b>exposed</b> <b>area</b> is treated with a bleaching preservative. The most common is a horticultural combination of lime and sulfur, available from many garden outlets. The preservative protects the wood from rot and pest infestation, and provides a uniform bleaching that resembles weathered, aged wood. If the lime-sulfur mixture used, it is usually colored {{with a small amount}} of dark paint to make it look more natural. Without paint pigments, the lime-sulfur solution bleaches wood to a bone-white color that takes time to weather and become natural-looking.|$|E
25|$|Plating, painting, and the {{application}} of enamel are the most common anti-corrosion treatments. They work by providing a barrier of corrosion-resistant material between the damaging environment and the structural material. Aside from cosmetic and manufacturing issues, there may be tradeoffs in mechanical flexibility versus resistance to abrasion and high temperature. Platings usually fail only in small sections, but if the plating is more noble than the substrate (for example, chromium on steel), a galvanic couple will cause any <b>exposed</b> <b>area</b> to corrode much more rapidly than an unplated surface would. For this reason, it is often wise to plate with active metal such as zinc or cadmium.|$|E

25|$|Cleavage is the <b>exposed</b> <b>area</b> of a dressed woman’s breasts lying {{over the}} sternum, and refers only {{to what is}} visible with {{clothing}} (or dense, nontransparent body art) that includes a low-cut neckline. In some cultures, display of cleavage is considered aesthetic or erotic, and {{may be associated with}} garments with low necklines that expose or highlight cleavage, such as ball gowns, evening gowns, lingerie, and swimwear. In these cultures women have, throughout history, sought to enhance their physical attractiveness and femininity, within the context of changing fashions and cultural-specific norms of modesty of the time and place. The methods practised in appropriate contexts have included the accentuation and partial display of breasts, including cleavage. In some cultures any display of cleavage may be culturally taboo (e.g. juyub in Islam,) illegal or otherwise socially disapproved.|$|E
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} while attached to the First Battalion, Fifth Marines, First Marine Division, during action against enemy Japanese forces on Peleliu Island, Palau Group, 15 September 1944. Before permitting his men to use an enemy dugout as a position for an 81-mm. mortar observation post, First Lieutenant Rouh made a personal reconnaissance of the pillbox and, upon entering, was severely wounded by Japanese rifle fire from within. Emerging from the dugout, he was immediately assisted by two Marines to a less <b>exposed</b> <b>area,</b> but while receiving first aid, was further endangered by an enemy grenade which was thrown into their midst. Quick to act in spite of his weakened condition, he lurched to a crouching position and thrust both men aside, placing his own body between them and the grenade and taking the full blast of the explosion himself. His exceptional spirit of loyalty and self-sacrifice in the face of almost certain death reflects the highest credit upon First Lieutenant Rouh and the United States Naval Service.|$|E
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity {{in action}} {{at the risk of}} his life above and beyond the call of duty. Sgt. Stone, distinguished himself while serving as squad leader of the 1st Platoon. The 1st Platoon was on a combat patrol mission just west of Landing Zone Liz when it came under intense automatic weapons and grenade fire from a well concealed company-size force of North Vietnamese regulars. Observing the platoon machinegunner fall critically wounded, Sgt. Stone remained in the <b>exposed</b> <b>area</b> to provide cover fire for the wounded soldier who was being pulled to safety by another member of the platoon. With enemy fire impacting all around him, Sgt. Stone had a malfunction in the machinegun, preventing him from firing the weapon automatically. Displaying extraordinary courage under the most adverse conditions, Sgt. Stone repaired the weapon and continued to place on the enemy positions effective suppressive fire which enabled the rescue to be completed. In a desperate attempt to overrun his position, an enemy force left its cover and charged Sgt. Stone. Disregarding the danger involved, Sgt. Stone rose to his knees and began placing intense fire on the enemy at pointblank range, killing 6 of the enemy before falling mortally wounded. His actions of unsurpassed valor were a source of inspiration to his entire unit, and he was responsible for saving the lives of a number of his fellow soldiers. His actions were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military profession and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the U.S. Army.|$|E

25|$|As thermal {{radiation}} travels, more or less, {{in a straight}} line from the fireball (unless scattered) any opaque object will produce a protective shadow that provides protection from the flash burn. Depending on the properties of the underlying surface material, the <b>exposed</b> <b>area</b> outside the protective shadow will be either burnt to a darker color, such as charring wood, or a brighter color, such as asphalt. If such a weather phenomenon as fog or haze is present at the point of the nuclear explosion, it scatters the flash, with radiant energy then reaching burn sensitive substances from all directions. Under these conditions, opaque objects are therefore less effective than they would otherwise be without scattering, as they demonstrate maximum shadowing effect in an environment of perfect visibility and therefore zero scattering. Similar to a foggy or overcast day, although there are few, if any, shadows produced by the sun on such a day, the solar energy that reaches the ground from the sun's infrared rays is nevertheless considerably diminished, due to it being absorbed by the water of the clouds and the energy also being scattered back into space. Analogously, so too is the intensity at range of burning flash energy attenuated, in units of J/cm2, along the slant/horizontal range of a nuclear explosion, during fog or haze conditions. So despite any object that casts a shadow being rendered ineffective as a shield from the flash by fog or haze, due to scattering, the fog fills the same protective role, but generally only at the ranges that survival in the open {{is just a matter of}} being protected from the explosion's flash energy.|$|E
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} while serving as Commanding Officer, Company E, Second Battalion, Fourth Marines, Ninth Marine Amphibious Brigade in action against enemy forces in the Republic of Vietnam. On 2 May 1968, Company E launched a determined assault on the heavily fortified village of Dai Do, which had been seized by the enemy on the preceding evening isolating a Marine company from the remainder of the battalion. Skillfully employing screening agents, Captain Livingston maneuvered his men to assault positions across 500 meters of dangerous open rice paddy while under intense enemy fire. Ignoring hostile rounds impacting near him, he fearlessly led his men in a savage assault against enemy emplacements within the village. While adjusting supporting arms fire, Captain Livingston moved to the points of heaviest resistance, shouting words of encouragement to his Marines, directing their fire, and spurring the dwindling momentum of the attack on repeated occasions. Although twice painfully wounded by grenade fragments, he refused medical treatment and courageously led his men in the destruction of over 100 mutually supporting bunkers, driving the remaining enemy from their positions, and relieving the pressure on the stranded Marine company. As the two companies consolidated positions and evacuated casualties, a third company passed through the friendly lines launching an assault on the adjacent village of Dinh To, only to be halted by a furious counterattack of an enemy battalion. Swiftly assessing the situation and disregarding the heavy volume of enemy fire, Captain Livingston boldly maneuvered the remaining effective men of his company forward, joined forces with the heavily engaged Marines, and halted the enemy's counterattack. Wounded a third time and unable to walk, he steadfastly remained in a dangerously <b>exposed</b> <b>area,</b> deploying his men to more tenable positions and supervising the evacuation of casualties. Only when assured of the safety of his men did he allow himself to be evacuated. Captain Livingston's gallant actions uphold the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and United States Naval Service.|$|E
500|$|The two {{subspecies}} of Banksia paludosa {{are identical}} in foliage and flower, and differ only on their size, habit, {{and response to}} bushfire. Banksia paludosa subspecies paludosa is most commonly encountered as a spreading multistemmed shrub generally under 1.5m [...] (5ft) high, or rarely 2m (7ft). In heathland habitats such as Nadgee or Barren Grounds Nature Reserves, it may not exceed 1m (3ft) in height. At an <b>exposed</b> <b>area</b> such as Green Cape, it is reduced further to a 30cm (12in) prostrate shrub. This subspecies has a woody base, known as a lignotuber, which begins developing {{in the first year}} of life. Banksia paludosa subspecies astrolux is a more open non-lignotuberous shrub which reaches 5m (16ft) high.|$|E

50|$|As a rule forest understories also {{experience}} higher humidity than <b>exposed</b> <b>areas.</b> The {{forest canopy}} reduces solar radiation, so the ground does not heat up or cool down {{as rapidly as}} open ground. Consequently, the understory dries out more slowly than more <b>exposed</b> <b>areas</b> do. The greater humidity encourages epiphytes such as ferns and mosses, and allows fungi and other decomposers to flourish. This drives nutrient cycling, and provides favorable microclimates for many animals and plants, such as the pygmy marmoset.|$|R
40|$|Aims: We {{analyze the}} {{possible}} clinical differences between bone jaw <b>exposed</b> <b>areas</b> in ONJ (osteonecrosis of the jaws) and ORN (osteoradionecrosis). Patients and method: Group 1 was composed with 53 ONJ cases and group 2 with 20 ORN cases. In both groups we analyzed, the major {{size of the}} <b>exposed</b> bone <b>areas,</b> the number of <b>exposed</b> <b>areas,</b> the location on the jaws {{and the presence of}} others associated and severe complications, such as skin fistulas and jaw fractures. We also investigated the possible local aetiology or trigger factor of the lesions. Results: The major size of the bone <b>exposed</b> <b>areas</b> was 2. 29 ± 2. 02 (mean ± std. dev) in group 1 and 2. 7 ± 2. 9 (mean ± std. dev) in group 2 (p> 0. 05). The number of <b>exposed</b> <b>areas</b> was 1. 8 ± 1. 34 (mean ± std. dev) in group 1 and 1. 2 ± 0. 55 (mean ± std. dev) in group 2 (p> 0. 05). There were more fractures in the second group (20 %) (p< 0. 05), and skin fistulas (35 %) (p< 0. 05). We found more patients in group 1 in which the dental extraction was the local aetiology of the bone necrosis (35 cases, 66. 03 %), while in group 2 there were 8 (40 %) (p< 0. 05). Conclusions: In our study with ONJ there were not differences in the major size of the bone <b>exposed</b> <b>areas,</b> but there were more lesions per patient than in group with ORN. The severity of the complications, such as jaw fractures and skin fistulas were higher in ORN, and in this group it was more frequent the spontaneous lesions than in the ONJ where it is more frequent following dental extractions...|$|R
500|$|In {{the opening}} of the final chapter, [...] "Death", the tree is 550years old and stands 80meters (260feet) tall. Under the weight of too much snow accumulating on the canopy mat, a branch breaks off. Stresses from a long winter with a dry summer weaken the tree's immune system. The <b>exposed</b> <b>area</b> where the branch broke becomes {{infected}} with insects and fungus. Insect larvae eat the buds and the fungus spreads {{into the middle of the}} tree and down to the roots. With its vascular tissue system compromised, the tree diverts nutrients elsewhere, resulting in needles turning orange on the abandoned branches. Death takes years to occur as successive parts are slowly starved of nutrients. As a snag, it becomes home to a succession of animals, like woodpeckers, owls, squirrels, and bats. Eventually the roots rot enough that a rainstorm blows it down. Mosses and fungi grow on the deadfall, followed by colonies of termites, ants, and mites, which all help decompose the remaining wood.|$|E

First, it has the same drawbacks as epoxy [...] the quantity of solder needed to adhere the TC to a substrate varies from location to location. Second, solder is conductive and may short-circuit TCs. Generally, there is a short length of conductor that is exposed to the temperature gradient. Together, this <b>exposed</b> <b>area,</b> along with the physical weld produce an Electromotive Force (EMF). Conductors and the weld are placed in a homogeneous environment within the temperature gradient to minimize the effects of EMF.|$|E
