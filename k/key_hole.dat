25|$|Banks demanded more {{protection}} and safe makers responded by designing larger, heavier safes. Safes {{with a key}} lock were still vulnerable through the <b>key</b> <b>hole,</b> and bank robbers soon learned to blast off the door by pouring explosives in this opening. In 1861, inventor Linus Yale Jr. introduced the modern combination lock. Bankers quickly adopted Yale's lock for their safes, but bank robbers came up with several ways {{to get past the}} new invention. It was possible to use force to punch the combination lock through the door. Other experienced burglars learned to drill holes into the lock case and use mirrors to view the slots in the combination wheels inside the mechanism. A more direct approach was to simply kidnap the bank manager and force him to reveal the combination.|$|E

2500|$|One {{can think}} of {{molecular}} docking as a problem of “lock-and-key”, in which one wants to find the correct relative orientation of the “key” which will open up the “lock” [...] (where {{on the surface of}} the lock is the <b>key</b> <b>hole,</b> which direction to turn the key after it is inserted, etc.). [...] Here, the protein can be thought of as the “lock” and the ligand can be thought of as a “key”. [...] Molecular docking may be defined as an optimization problem, which would describe the “best-fit” orientation of a ligand that binds to a particular protein of interest. [...] However, since both the ligand and the protein are flexible, a “hand-in-glove” analogy is more appropriate than “lock-and-key”. [...] During the course of the docking process, the ligand and the protein adjust their conformation to achieve an overall [...] "best-fit" [...] and this kind of conformational adjustment resulting in the overall binding is referred to as [...] "induced-fit".|$|E
2500|$|Surgery is {{increasingly}} performed via laparoscopic techniques. [...] Commonly {{referred to as}} <b>key</b> <b>hole</b> surgery, this surgery {{does not have the}} large incisions seen in a classically performed radical or partial nephrectomy, but still successfully removes either {{all or part of the}} kidney. Laparoscopic surgery is associated with shorter stays in the hospital and quicker recovery time but there are still risks associated with the surgical procedure. These have the advantage of being less of a burden for the patient and the disease-free survival is comparable to that of open surgery. [...] For small exophytic lesions that do not extensively involve the major vessels or urinary collecting system, a partial nephrectomy (also referred to as [...] "nephron sparing surgery") can be performed. [...] This may involve temporarily stopping blood flow to the kidney while the mass is removed as well as renal cooling with an ice slush. Mannitol can also be administered to help limit damage to the kidney. [...] This is usually done through an open incision although smaller lesions can be done laparoscopically with or without robotic assistance.|$|E

Yale had previously harbored the practical implementation of the tumbler lock for decades, and had sketched the idea in 1844. Yale was convinced that <b>key</b> <b>holes</b> in traditional locks made the locks susceptible to thieves who could use picks, gunpowder explosives, and heat to thwart the locks. This led him to employ permanent dial and shaft designs in his inventions, known as [...] "combination locks" [...] today.

60|$|It {{was late}} the {{following}} morning that a native houseman knocked upon {{the door of the}} room that had been assigned to Mrs. Billings and her grandson. Receiving no response he inserted his pass key in the lock, only to discover that another key was already there, but from the inside.

Receiving no reply he bent to the <b>key</b> <b>hole</b> in an attempt to look through into the room beyond. In so doing, being portly, he lost his balance, which necessitated putting a palm to the floor to maintain his equilibrium. As he did so he felt something soft and thick and wet beneath his fingers. He raised his open palm before his eyes in the dim light of the corridor and peered at it. Then he gave a little shudder, for even in the semi-darkness he saw a dark red stain upon his hand. Leaping to his feet he hurled his shoulder against the door. Herr Skopf is a heavy man--or at least he was then--I have not seen him for several years. The frail door collapsed beneath his weight, and Herr Skopf stumbled precipitately into the room beyond.|$|E

50|$|Making {{a keyhole}} welds: An {{outstanding}} characteristics of plasma arc welding, owing to exceptional penetrating power of plasma jet, {{is its ability}} to produce keyhole welds in work piece having thickness from 2.5 mm to 25 mm. A keyhole effect is achieved through right selection of current, nozzle orifice diameter and travel speed, which create a forceful plasma jet to penetrate completely through the work piece. Plasma jet in no case should expel the molten metal from the joint. The major advantages of keyhole technique are the ability to penetrate rapidly through relatively thick root sections and to produce a uniform under bead without mechanical backing. Also, the ratio of the depth of penetration to the width of the weld is much higher, resulting narrower weld and heat-affected zone.As the weld progresses, base metal ahead the keyhole melts, flow around the same solidifies and forms the weld bead. <b>Key</b> <b>holing</b> aids deep penetration at faster speeds and produces high quality bead. While welding thicker pieces, in laying others than root run, and using filler metal, the force of plasma jet is reduced by suitably controlling the amount of orifice gas.|$|R
