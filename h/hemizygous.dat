25|$|Congenital {{genetic disease}} is well {{understood}} {{and it is}} clear that epigenetics can play a role, for example, in the case of Angelman syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome. These are normal genetic diseases caused by gene deletions or inactivation of the genes, but are unusually common because individuals are essentially <b>hemizygous</b> because of genomic imprinting, and therefore a single gene knock out is sufficient to cause the disease, where most cases would require both copies to be knocked out.|$|E

2500|$|The Y {{chromosome}} {{is one of}} two sex chromosomes (allosomes) in mammals, including humans, {{and many}} other animals. The other is the X chromosome. Y is the sex-determining chromosome in many species, since it is {{the presence or absence of}} Y that determines the male or female sex of offspring produced in sexual reproduction. In mammals, the Y chromosome contains the gene SRY, which triggers testis development. The DNA in the human Y chromosome is composed of about 59 million base pairs. The Y chromosome is passed only from father to son. With a 30% difference between humans and chimpanzees, the Y chromosome is one of the fastest-evolving parts of the human genome. To date, over 200 Y-linked genes have been identified. All Y-linked genes are expressed and (apart from duplicated genes) <b>hemizygous</b> (present on only one chromosome) except in the cases of aneuploidy such as XYY syndrome or XXYY syndrome. (See Y linkage.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Males with an ABCD1 {{mutation}} are <b>hemizygous,</b> as {{they only}} have a single X chromosome. Female carriers will typically avoid the most severe manifestations of the disease, but often become symptomatic later in life. Although, the detection of an ABCD1 mutation identifies an individual who is affected with a form of ALD, there is no genotype - phenotype correlation. Within a family, there will often be several different phenotypes, {{despite the presence of}} the same causative mutation. In one case, a family with six affected members displayed five different phenotypes. There are no common mutations that cause ALD, most are private or familial. [...] Almost 600 different mutations have been identified, approximately half are missense mutations, one quarter are frameshifts, with in-frame deletions and splicing defects making up the remainder. The incidence of new mutations in ALD (those occurring spontaneously, rather than being inherited from a carrier parent) is estimated at approximately 4.1%, with the possibility that these are due to germline mosaicism.|$|E

50|$|Generally, the {{majority}} of individuals with creatine transporter defect express the following symptoms with varying levels of severity: developmental delay and regression, mental retardation, and abnormalities in expressive and cognitive speech. However, several studies have shown {{a wider variety of}} symptoms including, but not limited to attention deficit and hyperactivity with impulsivity, myopathy, hypotonia, semantic-pragmatic language disorder, oral dyspraxia, extrapyramidal movement disorder, constipation, absent speech development, seizures, and epilepsy. Furthermore, symptoms can significantly vary between <b>hemizygous</b> males and heterozygous females, although, symptoms are generally more severe in <b>hemizygous</b> males. <b>Hemizygous</b> males more commonly express seizures, growth deficiency, severe mental retardation, and severe expressive language impairment. Heterozygous females more commonly express mild retardation, impairments to confrontational naming and verbal memory, and learning and behavior problems.|$|E
50|$|CTD {{is caused}} by {{mutations}} in the SLC6A8 gene, located at Xq28. The SLC6A8 gene contains 13 exons and spreads across 8.5 kb of genomic DNA (gDNA). The presence of <b>hemizygous</b> mutations in males and heterozygous mutations in females on the SLC6A8 gene provides evidence that CTD is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. This usually results in <b>hemizygous</b> males having severe symptoms, while heterozygous female carriers tend to have less severe and more varying symptoms.|$|E
50|$|Male {{and female}} animals {{underwent}} a standardized phenotypic screen {{to determine the}} effects of deletion. Twenty three tests were carried out on mutant mice and six significant abnormalities were observed. <b>Hemizygous</b> males were infertile and thus it was not possible to produce homozygous mutant female mice. The remaining tests were therefore carried out on heterozygous mutant females and <b>hemizygous</b> males. Both displayed decreased grip strength while the males also had decreased body weight, length, bone mineral content and atypical peripheral blood lymphocyte counts.|$|E
50|$|The words homozygous, heterozygous, and <b>hemizygous</b> {{are used}} to {{describe}} the genotype of a diploid organism at a single locus on the DNA. Homozygous describes a genotype consisting of two identical alleles at a given locus, heterozygous describes a genotype consisting of two different alleles at a locus, <b>hemizygous</b> describes a genotype consisting of only a single copy of a particular gene in an otherwise diploid organism, and nullizygous refers to an otherwise-diploid organism in which both copies of the gene are missing.|$|E
50|$|Most human cancers are {{characterized}} by the inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene TP53 that encodes p53, either by mutation or loss of the gene. Genomic deletion of 17p13.1 TP53 locus also involves co-deletion of neighbouring genes such as POLR2A. POLR2A encodes the catalytic subunit of RNA POLII complex and is susceptible to inhibition by alpha-Amanitin. In colorectal cancer with <b>hemizygous</b> deletion of TP53 and POLR2A, inhibition of POLR2A leads to a selective inhibition of proliferation of the cancer cells independent of p53. POLR2A inhibition in POLR2A intact cells exerts no significant effect on cell proliferation, survival and tumorigenicity, but the inhibition is dramatic on POLR2A <b>hemizygous</b> cells. This suggests that collateral and therapeutic vulnerability exposed by TP53 and POLR2A <b>hemizygous</b> deletion in colorectal cancer can be exploited to treat TP53 deleted colorectal cancers using POLR2A inhibitors.|$|E

50|$|A {{chromosome}} in a diploid organism is <b>hemizygous</b> {{when only}} one copy is present. The cell or organism {{is called a}} hemizygote. Hemizygosity is also observed when one copy of a gene is deleted, or in the heterogametic sex when a gene is located on a sex chromosome. Hemizygosity must {{not be confused with}} haploinsufficiency, which describes a mechanism for producing a phenotype. For organisms in which the male is heterogametic, such as humans, almost all X-linked genes are <b>hemizygous</b> in males with normal chromosomes because they have only one X chromosome and few of the same genes are on the Y chromosome. Transgenic mice generated through exogenous DNA microinjection of an embryo's pronucleus are also considered to be <b>hemizygous</b> because the introduced allele is expected to be incorporated into only one copy of any locus. A transgenic can later be bred to homozygosity and maintained as an inbred line to reduce the need to confirm the genotypes of each litter.|$|E

5000|$|X-linked {{recessive}} inheritance is {{a mode of}} inheritance {{in which}} a mutation in a gene on the X chromosome causes the phenotype to be expressed in males (who are necessarily <b>hemizygous</b> for the gene mutation because they have one X and one Y chromosome) and in females who are homozygous for the gene mutation, see zygosity.|$|E
50|$|Creatine {{transporter}} defect (CTD) is an {{inborn error}} of creatine metabolism in which creatine is not properly {{transported to the}} brain and muscles due to defective creatine transporters. CTD is an X-linked disorder caused by mutations in the SLC6A8 gene. The SLC6A8 gene {{is located on the}} short arm of the sex chromosome, Xq28. <b>Hemizygous</b> males with CTD express speech and behavior abnormalities, intellectual disabilities, development delay, seizures, and autistic behavior. Heterozygous females with CTD generally express fewer, less severe symptoms. CTD is one of three different types of cerebral creatine deficiency (CCD). The other two types of CCD are guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency and L-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) deficiency. Clinical presentation of CTD {{is similar to that of}} GAMT and AGAT deficiency. CTD was first identified in 2001 with the presence of a <b>hemizygous</b> nonsense mutation in the SLC6A8 gene in a male patient.|$|E
50|$|Because the alleles of autozygous genotypes {{come from}} the same source, they are always {{homozygous}}, but allozygous genotypes may be homozygous too.

50|$|Male chicken of {{traditional}} sex-linked barred breeds like the Barred Plymouth Rock usually show much wider and clearer white bands than females {{of the same}} breed. Further characteristics of sex-linked barred chickens are the dilution of skin pigment in the legs {{as well as a}} white dot {{at the top of the}} head of freshly hatched chicks which can be used for autosexing: homozygous males have a much bigger spot than <b>hemizygous</b> females.|$|E
50|$|The {{disorder}} is inherited in an X-linked dominant manner.

5000|$|Williams {{syndrome}} is a microdeletion syndrome {{caused by the}} spontaneous deletion of genetic material from the region q11.23 of a chromosome 7, so {{that the person is}} <b>hemizygous</b> for those genes. The deleted region includes more than 25 genes, and researchers believe that being <b>hemizygous</b> for these genes probably contributes to the characteristic features of this disorder. CLIP2, ELN, GTF2I, GTF2IRD1, and LIMK1 are among the genes that are typically deleted from one chromosome in people with Williams syndrome. Researchers have found this hemizygosity for the ELN gene, which codes for the protein elastin, is associated with the connective-tissue abnormalities and cardiovascular disease (specifically supravalvular aortic stenosis and supravalvular pulmonary stenosis) found in many people with this syndrome. The insufficient supply of elastin may also be the cause of full cheeks, coarse voice, hernias and bladder diverticula often found in those with Williams syndrome. Studies suggest that hemizygosity in LIMK1, GTF2I, GTF2IRD1, and perhaps other genes may help explain the characteristic difficulties with visual-spatial tasks. Additionally, there is evidence that the hemizygosity in several of these genes, including CLIP2, may contribute to the unique behavioral characteristics, learning disabilities, and other cognitive difficulties seen in Williams syndrome.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} genetic {{disorders}} are caused {{when an individual}} inherits two recessive alleles for a single-gene trait. Recessive genetic disorders include albinism, cystic fibrosis, galactosemia, phenylketonuria (PKU), and Tay-Sachs disease. Other disorders are also due to recessive alleles, but because the gene locus {{is located on the}} X chromosome, so that males have only one copy (that is, they are <b>hemizygous),</b> they are more frequent in males than in females. Examples include red-green color blindness and fragile X syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Lujan-Fryns {{syndrome}} is inherited in an X-linked dominant manner.

Males are normally <b>hemizygous</b> for the X chromosome, having only one copy. As a result, X-linked dominant disorders usually show higher expressivity in males than females. This phenomenon is thought to occur with LFS.|$|E
50|$|In 1959, C. E. Ford and his team, in {{the wake}} of Jost's experiments, {{discovered}} that the Y chromosome was needed for a fetus to develop as male when they examined patients with Turner's syndrome, who grew up as phenotypic females, and found them to be X0 (<b>hemizygous</b> for X and no Y). At the same time, Jacob & Strong described a case of a patient with Klinefelter syndrome (XXY), which implicated the presence of a Y chromosome in development of maleness.|$|E
50|$|X-linked {{recessive}} {{traits are}} expressed in all heterogametics, but are only expressed in those homogametics that are homozygous for the recessive allele.

In contrast, a female must inherit two mutant alleles, a less frequent event since the mutant allele is rare in the population.|$|E
