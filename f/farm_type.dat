In 2006, the {{total labour force}} on Devon farms was 23,240 people, with around 7,953 employed full-time. The majority of land within the biosphere reserve is farmland, which helps support the local economy, but is not designated with statutory protection. The reserve is therefore managed carefully {{with the cooperation of}} farmers and landowners; as the boundaries of the reserve are the catchment areas of the River Taw and River Torridge, extra precaution must be taken in protecting water supplies from nonpoint source pollution. Rainwater can accumulate residues of fertilisers, especially nitrates and phosphates. Once leached into the rivers they can affect the river ecology through eutrophication, causing damage to plants and animals. This {{is one of the most}} pervasive water quality problems in Europe. Pathogens excreted by animals can also directly affect humans when transported by rainwater to rivers and the sea where people swim. Another problem is river sedimentation caused by fine soil particles washing from the land into rivers, this causes high rates of mortality in fish eggs and can affect fish feeding habits. The Biosphere Reserve Partnership provides support to farms that encourage sustainable practices, benefit the environment, and have a good role within the community.|$|E

The traceability and labeling of imported products in EU still remain a valuable issue (EU-Regulation 178 / 2002). One of the most important concerns of the customers is the product traceability, which is defined as the ability to screen the whole history or geographical origin or <b>farming</b> <b>type</b> of any food by certified methodologies. In this regard, we proposed to study the link between microbial ecology and <b>farming</b> <b>type</b> of foodstuffs via a unique molecular analytical technique which is followed by an image analysis. PurposeA unique molecular analytical tool using 16 S rDNA and 26 S rDNA profiles generated by “PCR-DGGE” was used to detect the variation in bacterial and yeast communities respectively of peaches from Jordan (control fruit, organic farming and conventional farming). ResultsWhen the 16 S and 26 S rDNA profiles were analyzed using image and multivariate analysis, certain microbiota were detected on peach fruits originating from Jordan. The resulted band profiles of bacteria and yeasts from different <b>farming</b> <b>types</b> were specific and {{could be used as a}} bar-code to discriminate the fruits' <b>farming</b> <b>type.</b> Significance of the paperThis method could be considered as a new traceability technique which provides fruits with a unique biological bar-code and permits the possibility to control the <b>farming</b> <b>type</b> of foodstuffs...|$|R

40|$|Many {{attempts}} have been made to reduce the impact of modern conventional farming on the environment and semi-natural ecosystems. One of them is organic farming, known primarily for the absence of pesticides and artificial fertilisers. The objective of this study was to study and test the differences in the spontaneous vegetation of comparable hedgerows in the same area situated within organic and conventional farming systems. The hedge bottom vegetation was surveyed during August 2001 in 13 hedgerows of each <b>farming</b> system. <b>Farming</b> <b>type</b> had not changed on either side of the hedgerows for the lifetime of the hedges (10 - 14 years). Sampling was associated with a set of 16 measured environmental variables. In the two farming systems hedgerows were comparable in terms of landscape, age, soil type, nutrient status and width. A mixed analysis of variance found no significant difference in measured soil and radiation variables between <b>farming</b> <b>types.</b> <b>Farming</b> <b>types</b> only differed in the use of pesticides. Significant differences between <b>farming</b> <b>types</b> in plant species diversity at alpha, beta and gamma levels were found. Also more species that normally occur in semi-natural habitats were found on organic farms. There was an overlap in species composition between <b>farming</b> <b>type,</b> but a slightly higher species turnover on conventional farms. The ordination axes were highly correlated with calibrated Ellenberg values of fertility, light and soil moisture. Soil fFertility and <b>farming</b> <b>type</b> were important factors to explain variation in species composition. Organic farming had a significantly reduced impact on hedge bottom vegetation compared to conventional farming. Higher extinction rates due to pesticide drift and immigration rates due to pesticide drift rates oin conventional farminsg may be responsible for the significantly higher species diversity and different species composition in hedges on organic farms.

40|$|Accounting for {{agricultural}} {{activities such as}} P fertilization in regional models of heavy metal accumulation provides suitable sustainable management strategies to reduce nutrient surpluses and metal inputs in agricultural soils. Using the balance model PROTERRA-S, we assessed the phosphorus (P), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) flux balances in agricultural soils of a rural region in Switzerland for different <b>farm</b> <b>types</b> and crop types. The P requirements of crops on arable farms were mainly supplied by commercial fertilizers and sewage sludge, while on animal husbandry farms P fertilizer demands were met by animal manure alone. Metal accumulation in soil was very different between the balance units. Estimated net Cd fluxes ranged between 1. 0 and 2. 3 g ha(- 1) yr(- 1) for arable <b>farm</b> <b>types,</b> 0. 6 and 2. 0 g ha(- 1) yr(- 1) for dairy and mixed <b>farm</b> <b>types,</b> and 9. 1 and 17. 8 g ha(- 1) yr(- 1) for animal husbandry <b>farm</b> <b>types.</b> Largest net Zn fluxes of 17. 9 - 39. 8 kg ha(- 1) yr(- 1) were estimated for animal husbandry farms, whereas for arable <b>farm</b> <b>types</b> net Zn fluxes of 101 - 260 g ha(- 1) yr(- 1) and for dairy and mixed <b>farm</b> <b>types</b> of 349 - 3360 g ha(- 1) yr(- 1) were found. The results indicate that P management is a primary factor determining the variation of these net Cd and net Zn fluxes. The latter were highly sensitive to the Zn/P concentration ratio in animal manure, atmospheric deposition and crop concentrations. Variation of net Cd fluxes resulted mainly from uncertainty in crop concentrations, atmospheric deposition, leaching parameters and uncertainty in Cd/P concentration ratio of commercial fertilizers. In addition, element balances were sensitive to empirical assumptions on fertilization strategy of farmers, such as the partitioning of manure between balance units...|$|R

This study study investigates inflow and outflow of major nutrients in urban and periurban production systems in Kano, Nigeria. To this end, 16 households representing three different urban and peri-urban (UPA) farming systems were studied using the MONQI toolbox (formerly known as NUTMON) to calculate nutrient flows and economic performances. The farm nitrogen (N) balance was positive at 56. 6, 67. 4 and 56. 4 kg farm- 1 year- 1 for commercial garden and crop-livestock (cGCL), commercial gardening and semi-commercial livestock (cGscL) and commercial livestock subsistence field cropping (cLsC) <b>farm</b> <b>types,</b> respectively. The same trend was observed for phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in all <b>farm</b> <b>types</b> except an annual negative K balance of 16 kg farm- 1 in cGCL. Across the different activities within the farms, land uses had positive N (359, 387 and 563 kg N ha- 1 year- 1) and P (74, 219 and 411 kg P ha- 1 year- 1) balances for all <b>farm</b> <b>types,</b> but again a negative K balance in cGCL with an average loss of 533 kg K ha- 1 year- 1. Partial nutrient balances in livestock production indicated a positive balance for all nutrients across the <b>farms</b> <b>types</b> but were slightly negative for P in cLsC. Commercial livestock keeping (cLsC) was economically more profitable than the other <b>farm</b> <b>types</b> with an average annual gross margin (GM) and net cash flow (NCF) of 9, 033 and 935. Cropping activities within cGCL and cGscL had GMs of 1, 059 and 194 and NCFs of 757 and 206, respectively, but livestock activities in both <b>farm</b> <b>types</b> incurred financial losses.

In 1997, dairy farms dominated among the converting farms in acreage, and a large majority (80 - 97 %) of the farmers of all <b>farm</b> <b>types</b> planned to continue with the same type of production system after conversion as they had before. Thus, the regional pattern in organic <b>farm</b> <b>types</b> will be similar to that which characterize conventional farms.
