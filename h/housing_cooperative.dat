40|$|<b>Housing</b> <b>cooperatives</b> became {{active in}} urban areas in Sweden, India and the United States during the interwar period. Yet, {{after the second world}} war, while <b>housing</b> <b>cooperatives</b> grew phenomenally {{nationwide}} in Sweden and India, they did not do so in the United States. This article makes a comparative institutional analysis of the evolution of <b>housing</b> <b>cooperatives</b> in these three countries. The analysis reveals that housing cooperatives' relationship with the state and the consequent support structures explain the divergent evolution. Although the relationships between cooperatives and the state evolved over time, they can be characterized as embedded autonomy, overembeddedness and disembeddedness in Sweden, India and the United States respectively. Whereas the consequent support structures for <b>housing</b> <b>cooperatives</b> became well developed in Sweden and India, such structures have been weak in the United States. The article highlights the need for embedded autonomy and the need for supportive structures to enable the growth of <b>housing</b> <b>cooperatives.</b> Copyright (c) 2010 The Author.

25|$|Each <b>housing</b> <b>cooperative</b> {{has their}} own bylaws. The members hold annual {{meetings}} in the <b>housing</b> <b>cooperative,</b> in which they elect {{a board of directors}} that take on the responsibility of managing the cooperation during the upcoming year. In most normal-sized cooperatives the board members are recruited among the inhabitants. The board sets the monthly fee, secures proper administrative procedures, keeps the property in good condition, and may initiate large renovation projects when necessary. The board is also involved when a member sells his apartment (i.e. sells his right to inhabit the apartment) to someone else, as the board has to make decisions on allowing the exit of old members and the entry of new members. If the buyer of a bostadsrätt is found financially viable, the board has no right to turn down a membership application. The board is also involved when individual members want to initiate large renovation projects, or when individual members want to rent out the apartment to a non-member.|$|E
