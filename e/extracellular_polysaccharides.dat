2500|$|Bacterial {{cellulose}} is {{an organic}} compound with the formula [...] produced by {{certain types of}} bacteria. While cellulose is a basic structural material of most plants, it is also produced by bacteria, principally of the genera Acetobacter, Sarcina ventriculi and Agrobacterium. Bacterial, or microbial, cellulose has different properties from plant cellulose and is characterized by high purity, strength, moldability and increased water holding ability. In natural habitats, the majority of bacteria synthesize <b>extracellular</b> <b>polysaccharides,</b> such as cellulose, which form protective envelopes around the cells. While bacterial cellulose is produced in nature, many methods are currently being investigated to enhance cellulose growth from cultures in laboratories as a large-scale process. By controlling synthesis methods, the resulting microbial cellulose can be tailored to have specific desirable properties. For example, {{attention has been given}} to the bacteria Acetobacter xylinum due to its cellulose’s unique mechanical properties and applications to biotechnology, microbiology, and materials science. Historically, bacterial cellulose has been limited to the manufacture of Nata de coco, a South-East Asian food product. With advances in the ability to synthesize and characterize bacterial cellulose, the material is being used {{for a wide variety of}} commercial applications including textiles, cosmetics, and food products, as well as medical applications. [...] Many patents have been issued in microbial cellulose applications and several active areas of research are attempting to better characterize microbial cellulose and utilize it in new areas.|$|E

50|$|Pathogenicity {{depends on}} many {{different}} {{factors such as}} the production of the siderophore desferrioxamine, metalloproteases, plasmids, and histone-like proteins. However, some essential factors of pathogenicity are variations in the synthesis of <b>extracellular</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> (EPS) and the mechanism of type III secretion system and its associated proteins. EPS helps bacterial pathogens avoid plant defenses, “clog” the host’s vascular system, protect bacteria against desiccation and attach to both surfaces and one another. One EPS is amylovoran, a polymer of pentasaccharide repeating units. If a strain of E. amylovora can not produce amylovoran it is not pathogenic and can not spread in plants. Levan is another EPS, and a lack of it will slow development of symptoms. Type III secretion systems are used for exporting and delivering effector proteins into the cytosol of host plants. This system mainly consists of Hrc proteins. Motility is another major virulence factor. Since E. amylovora is not an obligate biotroph, it is able to survive outside the host which allows it to spread in many ways such as rain.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the main}} aims of dental food for dogs is to {{minimize}} plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation.

Severe gingivitis in dogs can further advance into periodontal disease in which the periodontal tissues begin to degrade and, if left untreated, can lead to tooth loss. Studies have also shown that periodontal disease can negatively affect systemic health which impacts the overall health of the dog, therefore exhibiting the importance of preventing periodontal disease. Using a dental diet may be beneficial towards preventative care in regards to periodontal disease. Dental diets not only try to combat the buildup of plaque physically, but attempt to reduce plaque build up chemically as well. Chemical compounds such as anti-microbial elements are added to some dental diets to directly target the oral cavity in order to prevent gingivitis.|$|E
