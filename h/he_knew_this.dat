5|$|Bragg {{retained}} his position, relieving or reassigning {{the generals}} who had testified against him, and retaliated against Longstreet by reducing his command to only those units {{that he brought}} with him from Virginia. Despite the dysfunctional command climate under Bragg, and the lack of support from the War Department and President Davis concerning Bragg's removal, Longstreet did the best he could to continue to seek options in the Chattanooga Campaign. While Bragg resigned himself and his army to the siege of the Union Army of the Cumberland in Chattanooga, Longstreet devised a strategy to prevent reinforcement and a lifting of the siege by Grant. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> Union reaction was underway, and that the nearest railhead was Bridgeport, Alabama, where portions of two Union corps would soon arrive. After sending his artillery commander, Porter Alexander, to reconnoiter the Union-occupied town, he devised a plan to shift most of the Army of Tennessee away from the siege, setting up logistical support in Rome, Georgia, to go after Bridgeport to take the railhead, possibly catching Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker and arriving Union troops from the Eastern Theater in a disadvantageous position. The plan was well received and approved by President Davis, but it was disapproved by Bragg, who objected to the significant logistical challenges it posed. Longstreet accepted Bragg's arguments and agreed to a plan in which he and his men were dispatched to East Tennessee to deal with an advance by the Union Army of the Ohio, commanded by Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside. Longstreet was selected for this assignment partially due to enmity on Bragg's part, but also because the War Department intended for Longstreet's men to return to Lee's army and this movement was in that direction.|$|E

Frank Tallman, Mantz' partner in Tallmantz Aviation, wrote in his {{autobiography}} that, while many B-17s had been landed by one pilot, as far as <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> flight {{was the first time}} that a B-17 ever took off with only one pilot and no other crew; nobody was sure that it could be done.“ The footage was used again in the 1962 film The War Lover.|$|E

25|$|The {{youngest}} of fifteen children of Elliot Macnaghten, the last Chairman of the British East India Company, Macnaghten was educated at Eton. In his memoirs {{he describes his}} schooldays as the happiest of his life, even {{going so far as}} to write that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> to be so as he lived them. After leaving school in 1872, he went to India to run his father's tea estates in Bengal and remained there until 1888, albeit with occasional visits back home. In 1881 he was assaulted by Indian land rioters and as a result, became friends with James Monro, who was District Judge and Inspector-General in the Bombay Presidency at the time.|$|E
25|$|Turing {{discovers that}} Cairncross is a Soviet spy. When Turing confronts him, Cairncross {{argues that the}} Soviets are allies working for the same goals, and threatens to retaliate by {{disclosing}} Turing’s homosexuality if his role as an agent is revealed. When the MI6 agent Stewart Menzies appears to threaten Clarke, Turing reveals that Cairncross is a spy. Menzies reveals <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> already, and planted Cairncross among {{them in order to}} leak messages to the Soviets for British benefit. Fearing for her safety, Turing tells Clarke to leave Bletchley Park, revealing that he is gay and lying about never having cared for her. After the war, Menzies tells the cryptographers to destroy their work and that they can never see one another again or share what they have done.|$|E
25|$|One SEAL, {{unaware of}} Coffey's plan at the time, helps {{to locate the}} warhead, stopped on a ledge several {{thousand}} feet down the trench. Bud volunteers to use an experimental diving suit equipped with a liquid breathing apparatus to survive to that depth, though he will {{only be able to}} communicate through a keypad on the suit. Bud begins his dive, assisted by Lindsey's voice keeping him coherent against the effects of the mounting pressure, and reaches the warhead. The SEAL guides him in successfully disarming it. With nearly no oxygen left in the system, Bud types out that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> was a one-way trip, and tells Lindsey he loves her. As he waits for death, an NTI approaches Bud and takes his hand. He is guided to an alien ship deeper in the trench. Deep inside, the NTI creates an atmospheric pocket for Bud, allowing him to breathe normally. The NTI plays back Bud's message to his wife, and the two look at each other with understanding.|$|E

Monk tries to get Ludlow to explain how <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>this,</b> and Ludlow claims that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> Webster, Natalie and Julie were all in Sorrento's at the same time because Webster saw the 10% discount advertised on Julie's cast. However, Monk points out that Ludlow isn't explaining how <b>he</b> can <b>know</b> about the discount when he's never met Julie, and reveals that Ludlow actually had been in San Francisco. Additionally, Monk explains that Ludlow, like the killers of his own books, has been betrayed by a very hidden personality quirk.|$|R

One of the primary reasons for the short {{recording}} time was that the material selected for the album had been well-rehearsed and pre-arranged by the band on Led Zeppelin's tour of Scandinavia in September 1968.

[...] He theorized that, when the proposition of a new park or parkway came about, natural opposition {{was to be expected}} from the public. [...] <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> because he understood that the general populace saw outdoor city projects as a source of needless taxation for them, and that they did not believe that they could benefit from a public park in the same capacity as the wealthy.

2500|$|With a new {{position}} as Director of the Wilderness Society, Murie would continue to fight for and defend existing national parks. Murie relied on techniques that stressed the economic value of national preservation sites because <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> was {{the most effective way}} to appeal to America’s public. For instance, in the case of Jackson Hole National Monument, he emphasized how new tourism was contributing to Jackson's local economy. [...] Murie would go on to advocate for the preservation of many additional parks from human development. He believed that those who wished to [...] "seek the solitude of the primitive forest" [...] should have the ability to do so and that a democratic society should protect this right.|$|E
2500|$|When the Japanese began attacking Canton in {{the late}} 1930s, Dr. Cadbury, as a Quaker (and therefore, a pacifist) at first felt {{conflicted}} about supporting China's fighting in the war. However, <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> was necessary for China to defend itself against Japan and for preventing as many deaths of innocent people as possible. When discovering that the USA {{was one of the}} largest arms suppliers to Japan, he urged the USA to support the Chinese in [...] "their fight for freedom," [...] and not Japan. One of his associates even said [...] "It seems as though you were just like one of us Chinese." [...] However, after the war, his support for the Nationalists of China wavered. This is because though he worked to rally the support of Americans for the Canton people, the Chinese (Nationalist) government gave very limited help to them.|$|E

2500|$|The {{reason for}} the fourteen-year delay in Seder ‘Olam 11 is that Rabbi Yose (primary author of the Seder ‘Olam) had the idée fixe that the total time that Israel spent in its land must come out to an exact number of Jubilee cycles. If {{that had been the}} case, then we should have {{expected}} that 587 BC, when the exile began, would have been {{at the end of a}} Jubilee period. However, Rabbi Yose cited Ezek 40:1 as designating the time of the seventeenth Jubilee, and since <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> was fourteen years after the city fell, he presumed that counting had been delayed for fourteen years so that he could account for the fourteen years between the fall of the city and the observance of the seventeenth Jubilee. He also mentioned the previous Jubilee, in the time of Josiah. As much as he would have liked to put these last two Jubilees fourteen years earlier in order to be consistent with his idée fixe, Rabbi Yose could not do it because he knew these were historical dates, not dates that came from his own calculation.|$|E
2500|$|Maimonides {{endeavored}} to harmonize {{the philosophy of}} Aristotle with Judaism; and to this end he composed the work, Dalalat al-Ḥairin (Guide for the Perplexed)—known better under its Hebrew title Moreh Nevuchim—which served for many centuries as the subject of discussion and comment by Jewish thinkers. In this work, Maimonides considers creation, the unity of God, the attributes of God, the soul, etc., and treats them {{in accordance with the}} theories of Aristotle to the extent in which these latter do not conflict with religion. For example, while accepting the teachings of Aristotle upon matter and form, he pronounces against the eternity of matter. Nor does he accept Aristotle's theory that God can have a knowledge of universals only, and not of particulars. If He had no knowledge of particulars, He would be subject to constant change. Maimonides argues: [...] "God perceives future events before they happen, and this perception never fails Him. Therefore there are no new ideas to present themselves to Him. He knows that such and such an individual does not yet exist, but that he will be born at such a time, exist for such a period, and then return into non-existence. When then this individual comes into being, God does not learn any new fact; nothing has happened that He knew not of, for <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> individual, such as he is now, before his birth" [...] (Moreh, i.20). While seeking thus to avoid the troublesome consequences certain Aristotelian theories would entail upon religion, Maimonides could not altogether escape those involved in Aristotle's idea of the unity of souls; and herein he laid himself open to the attacks of the orthodox.|$|E
