50|$|Lion Air, {{the parent}} company of Batik Air, created Batik Air as a full-service airline which began {{operations}} in May 2013 using Boeing 737-900ERs leased from Lion Air. Batik Air's 737-900ERs were fitted with two-class seating, replacing Lion Air's one-class 737-900ER service. Batik Air provides a personal television (in-flight entertainment system) in every seat, light snacks and free meals, seat pitches of 32 in for economy class and 45 in for business class, and a <b>free</b> <b>baggage</b> allowance of 20 kg for economy class and 30 kg for business class.

5000|$|The huge {{flying boat}} was {{assembled}} at Boeing's Plant 1 on the Duwamish River in Seattle, and towed to Elliott Bay for taxi and flight tests. The first flight was on June 7, 1938, piloted by Edmund T. [...] "Eddie" [...] Allen. At first the aircraft {{had a single}} vertical tail, and Allen found he had inadequate directional control. The aircraft returned to the factory and was fitted with the endplates {{on the ends of}} the horizontal tail in place of the single vertical fin. This too was found to be lacking and finally the centerline vertical fin was restored, after which the aircraft flew satisfactorily. The 314 used a series of heavy ribs and spars to create a robust fuselage and cantilevered wing, obviating the need for external drag-inducing struts to brace the wings. Boeing also incorporated Dornier-style sponsons into the hull structure. The sponsons, broad lateral extensions at the waterline {{on both sides of the}} hull, served several purposes: they provided a wide platform to stabilize the craft while floating on water, they acted as an entryway for passengers boarding the flying boat and possessed intentional shaping to contribute additional aerodynamic lift in flight, nearly making the 314 an all-metal sesquiplane. Passengers and their baggage were weighed, with each passenger allowed up to 77 lb <b>free</b> <b>baggage</b> allowance (in the later 314 series) but then charged $3.25 per lb ($7.15/kg) for exceeding the limit. To fly the long ranges needed for trans-Pacific service, the 314 carried 4,246 gal of gasoline. The later 314A model carried a further 1200 gal. A capacity of 300 gal of oil was required for operation of the radial engines.|$|E

Since the {{introduction}} of same-sex marriage, {{there have been two}} parallel institutions (marriage and civil partnership) for the legal recognition of same-sex relationships in England, Wales and Scotland. The current study aimed to examine how those in a civil partnership or a same-sex marriage perceive civil partnership in the context of marriage equality. Eighty-two respondents completed a qualitative online survey, and their responses were analysed thematically. The respondents were divided between those who viewed civil partnership as: 1) a stepping stone to equality, and felt that civil partnerships should be discontinued; 2) a form of legal recognition <b>free</b> from cultural <b>baggage,</b> and argued the Government should make civil partnership available for all; or 3) those who displayed ambivalence and conflicting views.

40|$|Abstract. In {{a recent}} article, M. Tegmark [6] poses the {{hypothesis}} that our known universe is a “baggage free ” mathematical structure among many other possible ones, which also correspond to other physical universes —Mathematical Universe Hypothesis, MUH. Naturally, questions arise, {{such as how to}} obtain the physical properties of our world from the mathematical structure, or how many possibilities exist for a Universe minimally similar to ours. In this letter we present some results which can be regarded as a strengthening of MUH, as they give some hints on the derivation of spacetime in current physics from a <b>baggage</b> <b>free</b> mathematical structure. Concretely, we argue that the set of mathematical structures which can be interpreted as a description of a spacetime is drastically reduced, if one admits some natural postulates on minimal symmetry. Furthermore, the apparently very particular form of classical Galilei-Newton and relativistic spacetimes, is not arbitrary and cannot be regarded as “two possibilities among arbitrarily many others”. In fact, such theories are determined by a single mathematical structure which only permits four possible types of spacetimes. Finally, we show how the minimal postulates on symmetry can be endowed with a simple physical interpretation, i. e., they acquire “baggage ” in a natural way. 1...|$|R

It was now raining outside, and we were glad to climb into our {{apartment}} without at all seeing what Irun was or was not like. But we thought well of the place because we first experienced there the ample ease of a Spanish car. In Spain the railroad gauge is five feet six inches; and this car of ours was not only very spacious, but very clean, while the French cars that had brought us from Bordeaux to Bayonne and from Bayonne to Irun were neither. I do not say all French cars are dirty, or all Spanish cars are as clean as they are spacious. The cars of both countries are hard to get into, by steep narrow footholds worse even than our flights of steps; in fact, the English cars {{are the only ones}} I know which are easy of access. But these have not the ample racks for hand-bags which the Spanish companies provide for travelers willing to take advantage of their trust by transferring much of their heavy stuff to them. Without owning that we were such travelers, I find this the place to say that, with the allowance of a hundred and thirty-two pounds <b>free,</b> our excess <b>baggage</b> in two large steamer-trunks did not cost us three dollars in a month's travel, with many detours, from Irun in the extreme north to Algeciras in the extreme south of Spain.|$|R

He learns that Gage wrote a book on female serial killers (such as his daughter Jo, who, as it turns out, was in a coma after biting off her tongue, just before her father wanted to meet with her, an event which triggered Declan´s behaviour) to attract Wallace's attention. Knowing that she would try to seduce him, Gage spurned her advances to trick her into attempting to kill him. Gage suggested to her that he also hates Bobby, to manipulate her into killing Frank.
