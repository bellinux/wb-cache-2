40|$|The {{main focus}} {{of this study is}} to apply a {{computational}} tool for the flow analysis of the turbine engine that has been tested with ice crystal ingestion in the Propulsion Systems Laboratory (PSL) at NASA Glenn Research Center. The PSL has been used to test a highly instrumented Honeywell ALF 502 R- 5 A (LF 11) turbofan engine at simulated altitude operating conditions. Test data analysis with an engine cycle code and a compressor flow code was conducted to determine the values of key icing parameters, that can indicate the risk of ice accretion, which can lead to engine rollback (un-commanded loss of engine thrust). The full engine aerothermodynamic performance was modeled with the Honeywell Customer Deck specifically created for the ALF 502 R- 5 A engine. The mean-line compressor flow analysis code, which includes a code that models the state of the ice crystal, was used to model the air flow through the fan-core and low pressure compressor. The results of the compressor flow analyses included calculations of the ice-water flow rate to air flow rate ratio (IWAR), the local static wet bulb temperature, and the particle melt ratio throughout the flow field. It was found that the assumed particle size had a large effect on the particle melt ratio, and on the local wet bulb temperature. In this study the particle size was varied parametrically to produce a non-zero calculated melt ratio in the exit guide vane (EGV) region of the low pressure compressor (LPC) for the data points that experienced a growth of blockage there, and a subsequent engine called rollback (CRB). At data points where the engine experienced a CRB having the lowest wet bulb temperature of 492 <b>degrees</b> <b>Rankine</b> at the EGV trailing edge, the smallest particle size that produced a non-zero melt ratio (between 3 percent - 4 percent) was on the order of 1 micron. This value of melt ratio was utilized as the target for all other subsequent data points analyzed, while the particle size was varied from 1 micron - 9. 5 microns to achieve the target melt ratio. For data points that did not experience a CRB which had static wet bulb temperatures in the EGV region below 492 <b>degrees</b> <b>Rankine,</b> a non-zero melt ratio could not be achieved even with a 1 micron ice particle size. The highest value of static wet bulb temperature for data points that experienced engine CRB was 498 <b>degrees</b> <b>Rankine</b> with a particle size of 9. 5 microns. Based on this study of the LF 11 engine test data, the range of static wet bulb temperature at the EGV exit for engine CRB was in the narrow range of 492 <b>degrees</b> <b>Rankine</b> - 498 <b>degrees</b> <b>Rankine,</b> while the minimum value of IWAR was 0. 002. The rate of blockage growth due to ice accretion and boundary layer growth was estimated by scaling from a known blockage growth rate that was determined in a previous study. These results obtained from the LF 11 engine analysis formed the basis of a unique icing wedge...|$|R

Simulated engine exhaust can be supplied from a high pressure air source at 33 pounds of air per second at 530 <b>degrees</b> <b>Rankine</b> and nozzle pressure ratios of 4. 0.

Temperature, on the other hand, has a known minimum, absolute zero (where all vibrational motion of atoms ceases), and therefore, can be measured either in absolute terms (kelvins or <b>degrees</b> <b>Rankine),</b> or relative to a reference temperature such as the freezing point of water at a specified pressure (Celsius and Reaumur) or the lowest temperature attainable in 1724 (Fahrenheit).|$|R

The solution predicts an unusual functional dependence of pressure drop on the mass flow rate: that for lower and lower values of the mass flow rate, the pressure drop through a tube reaches a minimum value and then begins to increase. The application to parallel network flows of {{the solution of the}} transport equations for the flow in a single tube is illustrated with two examples. The most accurate numerical solution is compared with a simplified numerical solution which neglects inlet effects and with an approximate analytical solution.

Previous aborts occurred on STS-41-D, STS-51-F, STS-55 and STS-51. The automatic abort was initiated by the onboard General Purpose Computers (GPC) when the discharge temperature on MPS Main Engine #3 High Pressure Oxidizer Turbopump (HPOT) exceeded its redline value. The HPOT typically operates at 28,120 rpm and boosts the liquid oxygen pressure from 422 to 4,300 psi (2.91 to 29.6 MPa). There are 2 sensor channels measuring temperature on the HPOT. The B channel indicated a redline condition while the other was near redline conditions.

40|$|While {{solar thermal}} power plants are {{increasingly}} gaining attention and have demonstrated their applications, extending electricity generation after the sunset using phase change material (PCM) still remains a grand challenge. Most of the organic PCMs are known to possess high energy density per unit volume, but low thermal conductivity, that necessitates the use of thermal conductivity enhancers (TCEs) to augment heat transfer within PCM. In this paper, thermal performance and optimization of shell and tube heat exchanger-based latent heat thermal energy storage system (LHTES) using fins as TCE for medium temperature (< 300 <b>degrees</b> C) organic <b>Rankine</b> cycle (ORC) -based solar thermal plant are presented. A commercial grade organic PCM, A 164 with melting temperature of 168. 7 degrees C is filled in the shell side and heat transfer fluid (HTF), Hytherm 600 flows through the tubes. A three-dimensional numerical model using enthalpy technique is developed to study the solidification of PCM, with and without fin. Further, the effect of geometrical parameters of fin, such as fin thickness, fin height, and number of fin on the thermal performance of LHTES, is studied. It is found that fin thickness and number of fin play significant role on the solidification process of PCM. Finally, the optimum design of the fin geometry is determined by maximizing the combined objective of HTF outlet temperature and solid fraction of PCM {{at the end of}} the discharging period. The latent heat thermal storage system with 24 fins, each of 1 mm thickness and 7 mm height, is found to be the optimum design for the given set of operating parameters...|$|R
50|$|In the United States {{other units}} of measure for heat {{capacity}} may be quoted in disciplines such as construction, civil engineering, and chemical engineering. A still common {{system is the}} English Engineering Units in which the mass reference is pound mass and the temperature is specified in <b>degrees</b> Fahrenheit or <b>Rankine.</b> One (rare) unit of heat is the pound calorie (lb-cal), defined {{as the amount of}} heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Celsius. On this scale the specific heat of water would be 1 lb-cal/(K⋅lb). More common is the British thermal unit, the standard unit of heat in the U.S. construction industry. This is defined such that the specific heat of water is 1 BTU/(F°⋅lb).The path integral Monte Carlo method is a numerical approach for determining the values of heat capacity, based on quantum dynamical principles. However, good approximations can be made for gases in many states using simpler methods outlined below. For many solids composed of relatively heavy atoms (atomic number > iron), at non-cryogenic temperatures, the heat capacity at room temperature approaches 3R = 24.94 joules per kelvin per mole of atoms (Dulong-Petit law, R is the gas constant). Low temperature approximations for both gases and solids at temperatures less than their characteristic Einstein temperatures or Debye temperatures can be made by the methods of Einstein and Debye discussed below.Water (liquid): CP = 4185.5 J/(kg⋅K) (15 °C, 101.325 kPa)Water (liquid): CVH = 74.539 J/(mol⋅K) (25 °C)For liquids and gases, {{it is important to know}} the pressure to which given heat capacity data refer.
