5|$|As a teenager, {{he began}} to work for Los Tejas, a gang that ran the {{criminal}} activities {{in his hometown of}} Nuevo Laredo. From washing cars, running errands, and stealing car parts in Nuevo Laredo, Treviño Morales turned to the drug trade, starting with small-scale drug retail sales and smuggling. Unlike the first members of Los Zetas, he was never in the military. He was hired by them and the Gulf Cartel in the late 1990s for his experience moving contraband across the border. His fluent English and his criminal contacts {{on both sides of the}} U.S.-Mexico border allowed him to gain the trust of the then-leader of the Gulf Cartel, Osiel Cárdenas Guillén. When he joined the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas, Los Tejas, the local gang he once worked for, was absorbed by the former groups. Around 2005, Treviño Morales became the regional boss of Nuevo Laredo; he was in charge of fighting off the incursions of the Sinaloa Cartel, which was attempting to take control of the smuggling routes in the area. The Laredo–Nuevo Laredo area is a lucrative smuggling route for narcotics because of the Interstate 35 highway, which serves as a strategic pathway to San Antonio, Austin, and Dallas for future <b>drug</b> <b>distribution.</b> While in power, he orchestrated a number of assassinations in American cities and in Mexico by young U.S. citizens whom he put on his payroll. Treviño Morales was good at identifying and grooming young teenagers who he believed had the potential to become professional assassins for Los Zetas. These recruits, sometimes called Zetitas ("Little Zetas"), usually joined organized crime as young as twelve-years old to work first as smugglers and later as paid assassins.|$|E

25|$|The {{first modern}} law in Europe for the {{regulating}} of drugs was the Pharmacy Act 1868 in the United Kingdom. There had been previous moves {{to establish the}} medical and pharmaceutical professions as separate, self-regulating bodies, but the General Medical Council, established in 1863, unsuccessfully attempted to assert control over <b>drug</b> <b>distribution.</b> The Act set controls {{on the distribution of}} poisons and drugs. Poisons could only be sold if the purchaser was known to the seller or to an intermediary known to both, and drugs, including opium and all preparations of opium or of poppies, had to be sold in containers with the seller's name and address.|$|E
25|$|While dog {{fighting}} was previously seen as isolated animal welfare issues—and therefore rarely enforced, {{the last decade}} has produced a growing body of legal and empirical evidence that has revealed a connection between dog-fighting and other crimes within a community, such as organized crime, racketeering, <b>drug</b> <b>distribution,</b> and/or gangs. Within the gang community, fighting dogs compete with firearms as the weapon of choice; indeed, their versatile utility arguably surpasses that of a loaded firearm in the criminal underground. Drug dealers distribute their illicit merchandise, wagers are made, weapons are concealed, and the dogs mutilate each other in a bloody frenzy as crowds cheer on. Violence often erupts among the usually armed gamblers when debts are to be collected and paid. There is also a concern for children who are routinely exposed to dogfighting and are forced to accept the inherent violence as normal. The routine exposure of the children to unfettered animal abuse and neglect is a major contributing factor in their later manifestation of social deviance.|$|E
25|$|Pharmacy {{professionals}} have extensively studied {{the causes of}} errors in the prescribing, preparation, dispensing and administration of medications. As {{far back as the}} 1930s, pharmacists worked with physicians to select, from many options, the safest and most effective drugs available for use in hospitals. The process is known as the Formulary System and the list of drugs is known as the Formulary. In the 1960s, hospitals implemented unit dose packaging and unit dose <b>drug</b> <b>distribution</b> systems {{to reduce the risk of}} wrong drug and wrong dose errors in hospitalized patients; centralized sterile admixture services were shown to decrease the risks of contaminated and infected intravenous medications; and pharmacists provided drug information and clinical decision support directly to physicians to improve the safe and effective use of medications. Pharmacists are recognized experts in medication safety and have made many contributions that reduce error and improve patient care over the last 50 years. More recently, governments have attempted to address issues like patient-pharmacists communication and consumer knowledge through measures like the Australian Government's Quality Use of Medicines policy.|$|E

25|$|Having {{taken control}} of what was now the Genovese crime family in 1957, Vito Genovese decided to {{organize}} a Cosa Nostra conference to legitimize his new position. Held on mobster Joseph Barbara's farm in Apalachin, New York, the Apalachin Meeting attracted over 100 Cosa Nostra mobsters from around the nation. However, local law enforcement discovered the meeting by chance and quickly surrounded the farm. As the meeting broke up, Genovese escaped capture by running through the woods. However, many other high-ranking mobsters were arrested. Cosa Nostra leaders were chagrined by the public exposure and bad publicity from the Apalachin meeting, and generally blamed Genovese for the fiasco. Wary of Genovese gaining more power in the Mafia Commission, Gambino used the abortive Apalachin Meeting {{as an excuse to}} move against his former ally. Gambino, former Genovese bosses Lucky Luciano and Frank Costello, and Lucchese crime family boss Tommy Lucchese allegedly lured Genovese into a <b>drug</b> <b>distribution</b> scheme that ultimately resulted in his conspiracy indictment and conviction. In 1959, Genovese was sentenced to 15 years in prison on narcotics charges. Genovese, who was the most powerful boss in New York, had been effectively eliminated as a rival by Gambino. Genovese would later die in prison.|$|E
25|$|Allegation of cult-based {{abuse is}} the most extreme {{scenario}} of SRA. During the initial period of interest starting in the early 1980s the term was used to describe a network of Satan-worshipping, secretive intergenerational cults that were supposedly part of a highly organized conspiracy engaged in criminal behaviors such as forced prostitution, <b>drug</b> <b>distribution</b> and pornography. These cults were also thought to sexually abuse and torture children in order to coerce them into a lifetime of Devil worship. Other allegations included bizarre sexual acts such as necrophilia, forced ingestion of semen, blood and feces, cannibalism, orgies, liturgical parody such as pseudosacramental use of feces and urine; infanticide, sacrificial abortions to eat fetuses and human sacrifice; satanic police officers who covered up evidence of SRA crimes and desecration of Christian graves. No evidence {{of any of these}} claims has ever been found; the proof presented by those who alleged the reality of cult-based abuse primarily consisted of the memories of adults recalling childhood abuse, the testimony of young children and extremely controversial confessions. The idea of a murderous Satanic conspiracy created a controversy dividing the professional child abuse community at the time, though no evidence has been found to support allegations {{of a large number of}} children being killed or abused in Satanic rituals. From a law enforcement perspective, an intergenerational conspiracy dedicated to ritual sacrifice whose members remain completely silent, make no mistakes and leave no physical evidence is unlikely; cases of what the media incorrectly perceived as actual cult sacrifices (such as the 1989 case of Adolfo Constanzo) have supported this idea.|$|E
25|$|As the Dubois Brothers {{continued}} to make money and become wealthier they realized that the highest profits were {{in the drug trade}} realizing that a drug, especially methamphetamine, were cheap enough to get and highly addictive and once a customer was hooked they could not resist coming back for more creating a customer base. One of their previous drug pushers stated that the Dubois Brothers could get a pound of marijuana for $30 imported from Mexico and were able to sell it on the streets for up to $750 making a major profit. The Dubois Brothers, more specifically Adrien, Claude and Roland, had branched off logically into drug trafficking in the mid 70s and were controlling, in the west end and city center of Montreal, the sales of marijuana, hashish, LSD, amphetamines, and cocaine. They had a web of dealers set up to distribute the drugs all of which were working in licensed establishments under the control of {{at least one of the}} Brothers. Montreal police were able to seize a <b>drug</b> <b>distribution</b> for the Dubois Brothers that consisted of nearly two million tenure pills in late 1973 to early 1974. The Brothers took it one step further by going continental when they began having roots in Pakistan because Adrien Dubois decided to introduce a Sixth Family associate to his impressive source of hashish through a corrupt government official in Pakistan who had a ministerial position and thrived for foreign currency. The Dubois Brothers were always thirsty for more territory and money and that is what lead them to the McSween Turf War.|$|E
