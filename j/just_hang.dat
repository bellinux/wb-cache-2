500|$|Soon {{after her}} {{separation}} from Threapleton, Winslet met the director Sam Mendes when he {{offered her a}} part in a play. She refused the offer but began dating him. Disillusioned {{by the way the}} British tabloids portrayed her personal life, Winslet moved base to New York. She wed Mendes in May 2003 on the island of Anguilla. Their son, Joe, was born later that year. The family divided their time in New York with frequent visits to their estate at Cotswolds in England, and describing her family routine in 2009, she said, [...] "we go to the park, kick a ball around, go to a museum, watch a movie together or <b>just</b> <b>hang</b> out at home playing Monopoly". Amidst intense media speculation of an affair between Mendes and the actress Rebecca Hall, the couple announced their separation in 2010 and were divorced a year later. Winslet admitted to being heartbroken by the split, but remarked that [...] "there's no way I'm going to allow my children to be fucked up because my marriages haven't worked out".|$|E

[...] At times, she played hookey to see artists such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry. She became a popular {{photographer}} with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, [...] "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked." [...] The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, [...] "The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to... Pushiness worked for me that night!" [...] Linda said this about their meeting: [...] "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else ... and I saw Paul {{at the other side}} of the room. He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up." [...] The pair married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, [...] "We had a lot of fun together... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to <b>just</b> <b>hang,</b> to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment." [...] He added, [...] "We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married, and it was nearly called off... miraculous that we made it. But we did." ...|$|E
500|$|While still {{rooted in}} pop punk, Blink-182 finds the band {{expanding}} their sonic template with darker, restless songs. The compositions {{on the record}} {{have been described as}} musically diverse and [...] "borderline experimental," [...] with sullen moodiness and off-kilter hooks the basis for many tracks. The record pulls from a variety of styles, including electronic rock, jangle pop, and [...] "reflective" [...] alternative rock. Experimentation was constantly present: the band tried different mic techniques and toyed with harmonium organs, Polynesian Gamelan bells, [...] and turntables. The band infused these experimentalist elements into their usual pop punk sound, inspired by lifestyle changes (the band members all became fathers before the album was released) and side-projects (Box Car Racer and Transplants.) In a full article about the album in the November 20, 2003 edition of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Ben Wener described the music of the album as [...] "expansive, downcast, and sometimes spectral." [...] The New York Times considered that the album may have been influenced by the growing popularity of emo pop, while AllMusic regarded it a delve into post-punk. [...] "Much of the punk has been dissolved, the buzzsaw guitars faded into the corners, allowing room for staggering dynamics, cathartic guitar bursts and a weightier, more experimental and ambitious sound", wrote Tom Bryant of Kerrang!. The goal for Blink-182 was continuity: each song develops lyrically like chapters in a book, and songs segue into one another to present a cohesive feel instead of a regular collection of tracks. [...] In addition to the side-projects, the music of the album was inspired by the September 11 attacks and the onset of the Iraq War. The mood was unsettling for DeLonge, whose brother is a Navy officer: [...] "It was so weird because we'd all be glued to the TV, watching these bombs explode over another country. So I'd see all this and wonder where he was at, and then we'd have to go into the next room and sing or finish writing lyrics. I think it affected our moods throughout the day." [...] In addition, it was just inspired by socializing: [...] "We would <b>just</b> <b>hang</b> out for hours talking. It was really cool", said DeLonge.|$|E

Gaga's vocals span the nodes of A4 to D6 and it follows a basic sequence of B5–A5–E–B5–A5 as its chord progression. It is a pop rock song, which contains influences of other genres including country, disco, funk, and house. According to Mikael Wood from the Los Angeles Times, classifying the genre of the song is difficult, as it combines [...] "tinny Euro-house synths, slowed-down funk drums and a boot-scooting bass line straight out of Nashville." [...] The track has [...] "tongue-in-cheek" [...] lyrics, referencing cowboy in the opening verse: [...] "I just love a cowboy, I know it's bad, but I'm, like, can I <b>just</b> <b>hang</b> {{off the back of}} your horse and can you go a little faster?" ...|$|E

Linda and I were on this horse with no saddle, no reins, just the mane. If anybody fell, that camera truck is there to roll under. It was a very dodgey scene. You're galloping through gopher holes, etc. And they got the mares down at the far end. The stallion {{getting ready to go}} is smelling the mares and he's running like a bat out of hell and Linda's behind me saying, 'I'm very nervous about this horse.' And I said, 'Join the club. <b>Just</b> <b>hang</b> on and if you feel you can't do it, just don't do it. It's risky. There's no question about it, it's not a safe shot. What a horse is going to do, no one can tell.' But she was courageous, foolhardy or not, maybe me, too. She went ahead and we did it. I recall afterwards Loren Janes, my stunt man, came up and said,'You're crazy. I wouldn't have done that. It's too dangerous.' And he's probably right. I thought it was very foolish to have done it. Anyway, Linda was a gutsy little gal and she did it. So she was very pleasant to work with and very nice." ...|$|E

60|$|THEY {{bury their}} dead in vaults, above the ground. These vaults have a {{resemblance}} to houses--sometimes to temples; are built of marble, generally; are architecturally graceful and shapely; {{they face the}} walks and driveways of the cemetery; and when one moves through {{the midst of a}} thousand or so of them and sees their white roofs and gables stretching into the distance on every hand, the phrase 'city of the dead' has all at once a meaning to him. Many of the cemeteries are beautiful, and are kept in perfect order. When one goes from the levee or the business streets near it, to a cemetery, he observes to himself that if those people down there would live as neatly while they are alive as they do after they are dead, they would find many advantages in it; and besides, their quarter would be the wonder and admiration of the business world. Fresh flowers, in vases of water, are to be seen at the portals of many of the vaults: placed there by the pious hands of bereaved parents and children, husbands and wives, and renewed daily. A milder form of sorrow finds its inexpensive and lasting remembrancer in the coarse and ugly but indestructible 'immortelle'--which is a wreath or cross or some such emblem, made of rosettes of black linen, with sometimes a yellow rosette at the conjunction of the cross's bars--kind of sorrowful breast-pin, so to say. The immortelle requires no attention: you <b>just</b> <b>hang</b> it up, and there you are; just leave it alone, it will take care of your grief for you, and keep it in mind better than you can; stands weather first-rate, and lasts like boiler-iron.|$|E
