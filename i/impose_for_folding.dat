50|$|Initially {{based on}} the royal {{prerogative}} of mercy, and later under English Law, transportation was an alternative sentence <b>imposed</b> <b>for</b> a felony; it was typically <b>imposed</b> <b>for</b> offences for which death was deemed too severe. By 1670, as new felonies were defined, the option of being sentenced to transportation was allowed. Forgery of a document, for example, was a capital crime until the 1820s, when the penalty was reduced to transportation. Depending on the crime, the sentence was <b>imposed</b> <b>for</b> life or for a set period of years. If <b>imposed</b> <b>for</b> a period of years, the offender was permitted to return home after serving out his time, but had {{to make his own}} way back. Many offenders thus stayed in the colony as free persons, and might obtain employment as jailers or other servants of the penal colony.|$|R

Beta distributions are commonly used to model proportions or probabilities, particularly as conjugate distributions for binomial random variables. Stochastic orderings may arise, for instance, in considerations of fairness in coin flips. Stochastic order Beta distribution Binomial distribution Folded distributions Likelihood ratio order...|$|R
