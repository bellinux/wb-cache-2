5|$|Notable {{classical}} composers from Japan include Toru Takemitsu and Rentarō Taki. Popular {{music in}} post-war Japan has been {{heavily influenced by}} American and European trends, {{which has led to}} the evolution of J-pop, or Japanese popular music. Karaoke is the most widely practiced cultural activity in Japan. A 1993 survey by the Cultural Affairs Agency <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>more</b> Japanese had sung karaoke that year than had participated in traditional pursuits such as flower arranging (ikebana) or tea ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Within the osteopathic medical curriculum, {{manipulative}} {{treatment is}} taught as an adjunctive measure to other biomedical interventions {{for a number}} of disorders and diseases. However, a 2001 survey of osteopathic physicians <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>more</b> than 50% of the respondents used OMT on less than 5% of their patients. The survey follows many indicators that osteopathic physicians have become more like M.D. physicians in every respect —few perform OMT, and most prescribe medications or suggest surgery as the first line of treatment.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Labor's fourth consecutive defeat in the 2004 federal election it was widely speculated that Gillard might challenge Jenny Macklin for the deputy leadership, {{but she did not}} do so. Gillard had been spoken of as a potential future leader of the party for some years, but never stood in a leadership contest. After Mark Latham resigned as Labor Leader in January 2005, Gillard appeared on ABC's Australian Story in March 2006, after which an Ipsos Mackay poll conducted for Network Ten's Meet the Press <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>more</b> respondents would prefer Gillard to be Labor Leader; she polled 32% compared with Beazley's 25% and Kevin Rudd's 18%. Although she had significant cross-factional support, she announced on 25 January 2005 that she would not contest the leadership, allowing Beazley to be elected unopposed.|$|E

He <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>more</b> than forty naval officers were working at GHQ, but they were dispersed, working in nearly every corner of the staff. Tarbuck became head of a planning group known as the Red Team. This was one of three teams; there was also a White Team under a US army officer, Colonel Peyton, and a Blue Team under an Australian Army officer, Brigadier Tom White.|$|E
5|$|After {{exiting the}} Fijian {{archipelago}} of islands, Cyclone Gene moved towards the west across the South Pacific, towards Vanuatu, and was predicted {{to affect the}} archipelago between January 31 and February 2. However, during January 31, the system started to re-curve towards the southeast {{and as a result}} did not make landfall on the island, but Gene's outerbands produced gale force winds and heavy rain on various southern Vanuatuan islands for about 12 hours. However the system only caused no deaths and severe damage to Futuna island, while sparing other nearby islands. On Futuna Island, Gene caused damages to buildings, Plants used for weaving and generating income, trails, native and non native homes, waterlines, food gardens, food producing plants, crops, and other critical structures and littered footpaths with fallen trees and debris. As a result of damages to waterlines from falling debris, flooding and contaminated drinking water were reported in some villages with pipes openly leaking. After an aerial survey <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>more</b> than 70% of garden crops had been damaged by Gene, the Vanuatu Government declared Futuna island a disaster zone.|$|E

The study's lead author, David Ridley, said this could help explain why climate models did not predict the hiatus.|$|E

25|$|More recently, {{many states}} have {{authorized}} financial requirements {{that will make it}} more difficult for working-poor adults to access coverage.

John Esposito, using poll data from Gallup, wrote in 2008 that Muslims and Americans were equally likely to reject violence against civilians.

A 2005 study by Transparency International (TI) <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>more</b> {{than half of those}} surveyed had first-hand experience of paying a bribe or peddling influence to get a job done in a public office in the previous year. A follow-up study in 2008 found this rate to be 40 percent. In 2011, TI ranked India at 95th place amongst 183 countries in perceived levels of public sector corruption. In 2014, India saw a reduction in corruption and improved the ranking to 85th place.|$|E
25|$|There is {{increasing}} {{evidence that the}} majority of spontaneously arising mutations are due to error-prone replication (translesion synthesis) past DNA damage in the template strand. Naturally occurring oxidative DNA damages arise at least 10,000 times per cell per day in humans and 50,000 times or more per cell per day in rats. In mice, the majority of mutations are caused by translesion synthesis. Likewise, in yeast, Kunz et al. <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>more</b> than 60% of the spontaneous single base pair substitutions and deletions were caused by translesion synthesis.|$|E
