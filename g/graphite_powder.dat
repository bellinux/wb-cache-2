25|$|The powder {{is made by}} heating {{powdered}} {{petroleum coke}} above the temperature of graphitization, sometimes with minor modifications. The graphite scrap comes from pieces of unusable electrode material (in the manufacturing stage or after use) and lathe turnings, usually after crushing and sizing. Most synthetic <b>graphite</b> <b>powder</b> goes to carbon raising in steel (competing with natural graphite), with some used in batteries and brake linings. According to the USGS, US synthetic <b>graphite</b> <b>powder</b> and scrap production was 95,000 tonnes in 2001 (latest data).|$|E
25|$|As {{with metal}} casting and stereotyping, a mold is first formed from the model. Since {{electrotyping}} involves wet chemical processes and is done near room temperature, the molding material can be soft. Materials such as wax, gutta-percha (natural latex), and ultimately ozokerite were used. The mold's surface is made electrically conducting by coating it very thinly with fine <b>graphite</b> <b>powder</b> or paint. A wire {{is attached to}} the conducting surface, and the mold is suspended in an electrolyte solution.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{graphite}} in {{this end}} use mostly goes into carbon raising in molten steel, {{although it can}} be used to lubricate the dies used to extrude hot steel. Supplying carbon raisers is very competitive, therefore subject to cut-throat pricing from alternatives such as synthetic <b>graphite</b> <b>powder,</b> petroleum coke, and other forms of carbon. A carbon raiser is added to increase the carbon content of the steel to the specified level. An estimate based on USGS US graphite consumption statistics indicates that 10,500 tonnes were used in this fashion in 2005.|$|E

25|$|A proper lubricant, {{typically}} <b>graphite</b> <b>powder,</b> is essential. Wheel alignment {{is important}} both to minimize wheel {{contact with the}} axle head and body {{as well as to}} limit the contact between the wheels and guide rail as the car travels down the track. There are 32 friction causing surfaces on a pinewood derby car. These include the surfaces of all four wheels which touch either the axle, the body or the track and the surfaces of all four axles which touch the wheel. Neglecting to polish and lubricate any of these 32 surfaces will result in degraded performance. The center of mass of a typical car is low and slightly ahead of the rear axle, which helps the car track straight as well as providing a slight advantage due to the additional gravitational potential energy.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} way of {{recycling}} graphite occurs when synthetic graphite electrodes are either manufactured and pieces are cut off or lathe turnings are discarded, or the electrode (or other) are used {{all the way}} down to the electrode holder. A new electrode replaces the old one, but a sizeable piece of the old electrode remains. This is crushed and sized, and the resulting <b>graphite</b> <b>powder</b> is mostly used to raise the carbon content of molten steel. Graphite-containing refractories are sometimes also recycled, but often not because of their graphite: the largest-volume items, such as carbon-magnesite bricks that contain only 15–25% graphite, usually contain too little graphite. However, some recycled carbon-magnesite brick is used as the basis for furnace-repair materials, and also crushed carbon-magnesite brick is used in slag conditioners. While crucibles have a high graphite content, the volume of crucibles used and then recycled is very small.|$|E

Also in 1965, W. Helfrich and W. G. Schneider of the National Research Council in Canada produced double injection recombination electroluminescence for the first time in an anthracene single crystal using hole and electron injecting electrodes, the forerunner of modern double-injection devices. In the same year, Dow Chemical researchers patented a method of preparing electroluminescent cells using high-voltage (500–1500 V) AC-driven (100–3000Hz) electrically insulated one millimetre thin layers of a melted phosphor consisting of ground anthracene powder, tetracene, and <b>graphite</b> <b>powder.</b> Their proposed mechanism involved electronic excitation at the contacts between the graphite particles and the anthracene molecules.|$|E

40|$|Boron is a {{feasible}} {{alloying element}} for liquid phase sintering (LPS) of powder metallurgy (PM) steels. This {{study investigated the}} effect of nickel (Ni), which is widely used in PM steels, on the liquid phase sintering of boron-containing PM steels.

However, adding 1. 8 wt% Ni slightly improves the LPS densification from 0. 60 g/cm 3 to 0. 65 g/cm 3, though the green density is reduced. Thermodynamic simulation demonstrated that the presence of Ni lowers the temperature region of liquid formation, resulting in enhanced LPS densification.

25|$|In milling, the {{incoming}} graphite products and concentrates can be ground before being classified (sized or screened), with the coarser flake size fractions (below 8 mesh, 8–20 mesh, 20–50 mesh) carefully preserved, {{and then the}} carbon contents are determined. Some standard blends can be prepared from the different fractions, each with a certain flake size distribution and carbon content. Custom blends can also be made for individual customers who want a certain flake size distribution and carbon content. If flake size is unimportant, the concentrate can be ground more freely. Typical end products include a fine powder {{for use as a}} slurry in oil drilling and coatings for foundry molds, carbon raiser in the steel industry (Synthetic <b>graphite</b> <b>powder</b> and powdered petroleum coke can also be used as carbon raiser). Environmental impacts from graphite mills consist of air pollution including fine particulate exposure of workers and also soil contamination from powder spillages leading to heavy metal contamination of soil.|$|E
25|$|Straight away Munroe {{obtained}} a few lumps of black graphite which he beat to a pulp with a hammer. He separated the fine particles that floated {{to the top}} of the water with a spoon and mixed them with a clay solution. His first experiments with this lead solution was not very successful. He continued making cabinet maker’s squares and sold the few of these which he could. In this time he continued experimenting with graphite lead for pencils with little accomplishment. He had no knowledge of the subject and feared consulting others as they might take the idea and produce pencils themselves. Munroe continued experimenting in secret with <b>graphite</b> <b>powder</b> formulas on his own. Eventually he figured a way to come up with a suitable graphite paste formula of various ingredients that could be poured into a slotted line made in some cedar wood blanks. The pencil centers would be his secret formula of a mixture of dried graphite paste of clay and other unknown ingredients. They were air dried and not hardened by firing in a furnace as Europeans did, so the quality was not as good as theirs—but it was fine enough to write with.|$|E
25|$|Graphite and <b>graphite</b> <b>powder</b> {{are valued}} in {{industrial}} applications for their self-lubricating and dry lubricating properties. There {{is a common}} belief that graphite's lubricating properties are solely due to the loose interlamellar coupling between sheets in the structure. However, {{it has been shown}} that in a vacuum environment (such as in technologies for use in space), graphite degrades as a lubricant, due to the hypoxic conditions. This observation led to the hypothesis that the lubrication is due to the presence of fluids between the layers, such as air and water, which are naturally adsorbed from the environment. This hypothesis has been refuted by studies showing that air and water are not absorbed. Recent studies suggest that an effect called superlubricity can also account for graphite's lubricating properties. The use of graphite is limited by its tendency to facilitate pitting corrosion in some stainless steel, and to promote galvanic corrosion between dissimilar metals (due to its electrical conductivity). It is also corrosive to aluminium in the presence of moisture. For this reason, the US Air Force banned its use as a lubricant in aluminium aircraft, and discouraged its use in aluminium-containing automatic weapons. Even graphite pencil marks on aluminium parts may facilitate corrosion. Another high-temperature lubricant, hexagonal boron nitride, has the same molecular structure as graphite. It is sometimes called white graphite, due to its similar properties.|$|E

500|$|Sodium forms {{flammable}} {{hydrogen and}} caustic sodium hydroxide on contact with water; ingestion and contact with moisture on skin, eyes or mucous membranes can cause severe burns. Sodium spontaneously explodes {{in the presence}} of an oxidizer such as water.

Other effective agents include Lith-X, which has <b>graphite</b> <b>powder</b> and an organophosphate flame retardant, and dry sand. Sodium fires are prevented in nuclear reactors by isolating sodium from oxygen by surrounding sodium pipes with inert gas.

500|$|Diamond nanocrystals (5nm in diameter) can {{be formed}} by detonating certain carbon-containing {{explosives}} {{in a metal}} chamber. These nanocrystals are called [...] "detonation nanodiamond". During the explosion, the pressure and temperature in the chamber become high enough to convert the carbon of the explosives into diamond. Being immersed in water, the chamber cools rapidly after the explosion, suppressing conversion of newly produced diamond into more stable graphite. In a variation of this technique, a metal tube filled with <b>graphite</b> <b>powder</b> {{is placed in the}} detonation chamber. The explosion heats and compresses the graphite to an extent sufficient for its conversion into diamond. The product is always rich in graphite and other non-diamond carbon forms and requires prolonged boiling in hot nitric acid (about 1 day at 250°C) to dissolve them. The recovered nanodiamond powder is used primarily in polishing applications. It is mainly produced in China, Russia and Belarus and started reaching the market in bulk quantities by the early 2000s.|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the magnetorheology and sensing {{capabilities}} of graphite based MR Elastomers (Gr MREs). By introducing graphite to conventional MREs, the Gr MREs with various graphite weight fraction are derived. Both steady state tests and dynamic tests such as strain amplitude sweep and angular frequency sweep were {{used to test the}} magnetorheology of Gr MREs. With the help of graphite in MREs, the storage and loss moduli are both changed. The samples with higher graphite weight fraction show higher initial storage and loss moduli and lower MR effects. Also the microstructures of isotropic and anisotropic Gr MREs are observed. We can see that the carbonyl iron particles array in chains in the anisotropic MREs and the <b>graphite</b> <b>powders</b> disperse in matrix randomly. <b>Graphite</b> <b>powders</b> contribute to the magnetorheology of MREs such as increasing the initial mechanical properties and diminishing the MR effect. Also the <b>graphite</b> <b>powders</b> connect different carbonyl iron chains parallelly, which helps to reduce the total resistance of MREs. The conductivity of Gr MREs is affected by three factors. The first is the weight fraction of graphite in the Gr MRE samples; the more weight fraction of graphite is, the more conductive Gr MRE sample is. The external force applied on the samples is another factor. Increasing external force can cause the electrical resistance decrease. The other cause affecting sample conductivity is the intensity of magnetic field. When the intensity rises, the resistance of samples goes down. This paper introduces the Gr MREs’ fabrication process, analyzes the relationship between the resistance of Gr MREs, the external force and the intensity of magnetic field and shows the data gotten from the experiments...|$|R
