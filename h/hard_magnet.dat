5000|$|Comparing the {{exchange}} spring magnet's hysteresis loop {{with that of}} a conventional <b>hard</b> <b>magnet</b> demonstrates that {{the exchange}} spring magnet is more likely to recover from the opposing external field.

50|$|In the {{previous}} process, when the magnetic {{moments in the}} <b>hard</b> <b>magnet</b> start to rotate, the intensity of external field is already {{much higher than the}} coercivity of the soft phase, but there is still a transition region in soft phase. If the thickness of the soft phase is less than twice as thick as the transition region, the soft phase should have a large effective coercivity, smaller than but comparable to the coercivity of the hard phase.|$|E
30|$|Ferromagnetic {{materials}} {{can be categorized}} into soft and <b>hard</b> <b>magnets</b> (Mody et al. 2013).

50|$|The {{squareness}} (saturation remanence {{divided by}} saturation magnetization) and coercivity are {{figures of merit}} for <b>hard</b> <b>magnets</b> although energy product (saturation magnetization times coercivity) is most commonly quoted. The 1980s saw the development of rare-earth magnets with high energy products but undesirably low Curie temperatures. Since the 1990s new exchange spring <b>hard</b> <b>magnets</b> with high coercivities have been developed.|$|R
50|$|In a thin soft phase, it is {{hard for}} the {{external}} field to rotate the magnetic moments, similar to a <b>hard</b> <b>magnet</b> with high saturation magnetization. After applying a high external field to partially demagnetize the magnetic moments in the hard phase and after subsequently removing the external field, the rotated moments in the soft phase can be rotated back by exchange coupling with the hard phase (Figure 5). This phenomenon is shown in the hysteresis loop of an exchange spring magnet (Figure 6).|$|E
50|$|The {{magnetostatic energy}} is the energy {{stored in the}} field {{generated}} by a material's magnetic moments. The magnet's field reaches its maximum intensity if all the magnetic moments orient in one direction; this is what occurs in a <b>hard</b> <b>magnet.</b> In order to prevent building up the magnetic field, sometimes magnetic moments tend to form loops. That way, the energy stored in the magnetic field can be constrained; this is what occurs in a soft magnet. What determines whether a magnet is hard or soft is the dominant term of its magnetic energy. For hard magnets, the anisotropy constant is relatively large, making the magnetic moments align with easy axis. The opposite case applies to soft magnets, in which the magnetostatic energy is dominant.|$|E
50|$|From left {{to right}} in Figure 3, an {{external}} field is first applied in an upward direction in order to saturate the magnet. Then, the external field is reversed and starts to demagnetize the magnet. Since the coercivity of the hard phase is relatively high, the moments remain unchanged so as to minimize the anisotropy and exchange energy. The magnetic moments in the soft phase start rotating to align with the applied field. Because of the exchange coupling at the soft/hard interface, the magnetic moments at the soft phase boundary have to align with the adjacent moment in hard phase. At the regions close to the interface, because of exchange coupling, the chain of magnetic moments acts like a spring. If the external field is increased, more moments in soft phase rotate downward, and {{the width of the}} transition region becomes smaller as the exchange energy density increases. The magnetic moments in the hard phase do not rotate until the external field is high enough that the exchange energy density in the transition region is comparable to the anisotropy energy density in the hard phase. At this point, the rotation of magnetic moments in the soft phase starts to affect the hard phase. As the external field surpasses the hard material's coercivity, the <b>hard</b> <b>magnet</b> gets fully demagnetized.|$|E

NdFeB magnets are always produced from powder, mainly by CIP or uniaxial pressing plus sintering. Despite some early patents to also produce them by MIM no commercial production has taken place.

5000|$|Metal cores in {{the range}} 1 to 120 micrometres with a glass coating a few micrometres in {{diameter}} can be readily produced by this method. Glass-coated microwires successfully produced by this method include copper, silver, gold, iron, platinum, and various alloy compositions. It has even proved possible to produce amorphous metal ("glassy metal") cores because the cooling rate achievable by this process can be {{of the order of}} 1,000,000 kelvins per second. Glass-coated wire receives all of its material properties from its microstructure. The microstructure in turn receives its properties from {{the rate at which the}} wire is cooled. The magnetic properties of glass-coated wires also differ greatly from the properties of amorphous wires and cold-drawn wires due to the difference of the internal stresses that are occurring in the wire. When choosing a metal for the wire Fe-rich compositions of metals typically hold and advantage over Co-rich compositions since Co is more expensive and Fe-rich metals have better magnetic properties. Although the magnetic properties such as the magnetic softness of Fe-rich materials can be improved by annealing the metal while it is under mechanical stresses. When a magnet is said to be [...] "soft" [...] it implies that the magnetic abilities are only temporary. These magnets are easily magnetized when they are exposed to an electrical current. These types of magnets are often used in computers and technology to control the flow of electric current. This is what makes these wires useful in technological applications because they can easily control the flow of electricity in a device. A <b>hard</b> <b>magnet</b> on the other hand does not need an electrical current to remain magnetized so these magnets are permanent. These magnets are used to create magnetic fields in devices such as an alternator that is in the engine of a car.|$|E

40|$|Novel {{concepts}} for {{the magnetic}} circuit in magnetorheological dampers have been proven. In {{contrast to the}} established magnetic circuits where the magnetic field for {{the control of the}} magnetorheological fluid is generated by the coil of an electromagnet, hybrid magnetic circuits consisting of at least one permanent or <b>hard</b> <b>magnet</b> and an electromagnet are used in the new approaches. Three different technical configurations are distinguished: (1) The electromagnet is combined with two permanent magnets, whose magnetization cannot be modified even by strong magnetic fields of the electromagnet. The main advantage is the improved fail-safe behavior of the damper in case of a power failure. (2) The electromagnet is combined with a <b>hard</b> <b>magnet,</b> whose magnetization can be modified by the electromagnet.

The R element is chosen to develop high anisotropy parameters {{and a small}} amount of a light element X (e. g.

The insertion of dicarboxylate ligands comprising 1 to 4 thiophene rings between metal hydroxides and the structures and physical properties of 10 hybrid organic/inorganic systems M-Tn (MCu, Ni, Co, n = 1 - 4) have been investigated. Controlled hydrothermal synthesis leads to layered compounds of transition metals in octahedral sites only. A wide palette of magnetic behaviors has been observed. The four copper derivatives with interlayer distances of 1. 0 - 2. 1 nm show either antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic intra-layers interactions with a ferromagnetic or canted antiferromagnetic long range ordering. The nickel derivatives are antiferromagnetic and show a metamagnetic transition for interlayer distances below 1. 3 nm and are ferrimagnetic above 1. 7 nm, with low TN (< 4 K) and coercivity (μ 0 HC < 30 mT).

40|$|In {{order to}} convert the {{well-known}} Fe-Co-B alloy from a soft to a <b>hard</b> <b>magnet,</b> we propose tetragonal strain by interstitial boron. Density functional theory reveals that when B atoms occupy octahedral interstitial sites, the bcc Fe-Co lattice is strained spontaneously. Such highly distorted Fe-Co is predicted to reach a strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy which may compete with shape anisotropy. Probing this theoretical suggestion experimentally, epitaxial films are examined. A spontaneous strain up to 5 % lattice distortion is obtained for B contents up to 4 at%, which leads to uniaxial anisotropy constants exceeding 0. 5 MJ/m^ 3.
