Another tagline is a spoof from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet ("Romeo, Oh Romeo, <b>Get</b> <b>Out</b> <b>Of</b> <b>My</b> Face.") and another is a line from The Taming of the Shrew that is spoken in the film by Cameron ("I burn, I pine, I perish!"). The {{original}} script was finalized on November 12, 1997.|$|E
25|$|I am {{extremely}} {{disappointed with}} the overall picture of Test play, which {{was not the kind}} of cricket I want to watch. People who pay to see a Test are entitled to see a real match, not a tactical tie-up. I think it is a fair result that neither England or Australia won the series. I can't <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head why Test matches are so different from State matches, where I think England played pretty well. It is all so different from what we visualised. After all this talk of brighter cricket I think we should get back to playing cricket. Perhaps a little more action and less talk.|$|E

Sambora explained that [...] "It's [...] 'Have a nice day; <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> face'—therefore the smirk. To me, it's {{much more of}} a Clint Eastwood 'Have a nice day' than a smiley face 'Have a nice day.'" ...|$|E

Later that year, a team of RCA Records representatives including the label's CEO Peter Edge met with Sia to discuss a record deal. The singer agreed to a contract for a new album in which she was not obliged to tour or do press appearances to promote the album. In an interview published by NME in February 2015, Sia revealed that 1000 Forms of Fear was released as a contractual obligation: [...] "Basically, I put this out to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> publishing deal.

I didn't want to get famous so I kept all the songs I wanted and {{had a lot of fun}} making it." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite Steiger's acclaim as an actor, he was {{frequently}} accused of overacting and won his {{fair share of}} critics, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s. His acting was so dynamic at times that critics found him excessive and overbearing, and even uncomfortable or laughable to watch. Steiger once clashed with Armenian director Rouben Mamoulian, during a theatrical production of Oklahoma!, as he was intolerant of Steiger's [...] "unusual acting technique". Steiger ignored the director's concerns that he was mumbling his lines, and when he began chomping loudly on an apple during a scene with Gordon MacRae, Mamoulian exclaimed: [...] "Get out of my theater. <b>Get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life!", and fired him. Even Kazan found several of the Actors Studio's techniques disagreeable, preferring [...] "more humor and verve and less self-indulgence, self-pity and self-awareness". Kazan felt that Steiger often displayed a competitive edge as an actor and tried to steal scenes from his co-stars. Steiger rejected these claims, insisting that he was merely [...] "trying to take the medium of acting to as far as I can go, and that why I sometimes go over the edge".|$|E

I wish people wouldn't be very big for five minutes and rotten for twenty years. Just keep your 'big' and keep your 'rotten' and <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life, because, quite frankly, I would rather have gone to a children's home and be with a lot of other kids being treated the same.
