40|$|Wafer probing is {{a testing}} process to inspect {{semiconductor}} wafers before packaging for defects by checking the electrical conductivity via physical {{contact between the}} wafers and the probe card. During the contact process, {{the shape of the}} probe needle and the mounting configuration onto the probe card have large influences on the stresses and contact force that the probe needles experience. In this paper, static performance of a vertical-type probe needle integrated with <b>floating</b> <b>mount</b> technology is analyzed with a nonlinear finite element analysis. The comparison between fixed <b>mount</b> and <b>floating</b> <b>mount</b> technologies {{is a part of the}} analyses. The geometry of a vertical probe needle is optimized to minimize the stress that occurs during the overdrive process, while maintaining adequate force for proper contact with the wafer. Effects of major overall dimensions of probe needle on the maximum stress and contact force is analyzed first, and then curvature of the probe needle body is optimized by employing a constrained minimization function, fmincon, in MATLAB. The maximum stress in the vertical probe pin at 125 µm overdrive is effectively reduced from 1339 MPa to 972 MPa by applying <b>floating</b> <b>mount</b> technology over the fixed mount, and further reduced to 666 MPa by applying the optimization scheme. The final optimized design induced the contact force of 5. 217 gf, which is in the range of the required contact force of 5 to 8 gf. Fatigue life increased from 19, 219 cycles to 108, 129 by applying <b>floating</b> <b>mount</b> over fixed mount, and further increased to 830, 596 for the optimized design...|$|R

40|$|Today, the use {{of surface}} <b>mount</b> <b>connectors</b> to {{increase}} the component density of printed circuit boards is growing as a total percentage of connectors processed in various printed circuit boards. Resources have been channeled to develop various requirements pertaining to the design and processing of surface <b>mount</b> <b>connectors.</b> This paper summarizes {{some of the key}} developments in relation to the evolution of the pager design. Pagers have become small, cheap and reliable. With the drive towards smaller and slimmer pagers with increased functions, a two-printed-circuit-board-construction is needed for design flexibility due to the great variations in language and feature sets. What you can hold in your hand, you can drop. Therefore the pager (and the connector inside) must be mechanically rugged enough to take the various impacts in the course of its useful life and continue to function as designed. 2 To minimize the void area in the pager, the board-to-board connector stacked height is driven down to the height of the tallest components. Besides switching from through-hole to surface <b>mount</b> technology, <b>connector</b> density has been moved from 1. 27 mm to 1. 0 mm, and gradually to 0. 8 mm and 0. 5 mm pitch {{in order to meet the}} demands for miniaturization. Added to that, connectors also switched from pin-and-socket to blade-on-beam design technology to meet the demand for a robust system that can withstand physical shocks suffered by smaller, denser and more complex pagers. In conclusion, connectors will continue to evolve and remain one of the key elements in the evolution of packaging and interconnect solutions for pagers...|$|R

5000|$|In {{a flying}} boat, {{the main source}} of {{buoyancy}} is the fuselage, which acts like a ship's hull in the water because the fuselage's underside has been hydrodynamically shaped to allow water to flow around it.
