5|$|Nuclear {{power and}} fossil fuels are subsidized by many governments, and wind power {{and other forms}} of {{renewable}} energy are also often subsidized. For example, a 2009 study by the Environmental Law Institute assessed the size and structure of U.S. energy subsidies over the 2002–2008 period. The study estimated that subsidies to fossil-fuel based sources amounted to approximately $72 billion over this period and subsidies to renewable fuel sources totalled $29 billion. In the United States, the federal government has paid US$74billion for energy subsidies to support R for nuclear power ($50 billion) and fossil fuels ($24 billion) from 1973 to 2003. During this same time frame, renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency received a total of US$26billion. It has been suggested that a subsidy shift would help {{to level the playing field}} and support growing energy sectors, namely solar power, wind power, and biofuels. <b>History</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> no energy sector was developed without subsidies.|$|E

25|$|It {{turned out}} however that Siam {{was not his}} {{greatest}} adversary.

25|$|Although rather {{informal}} and small scale, {{the early days}} of Japanese hip-hop provide the history for the emergence of the cultural movement. Early hip-hop was not led by corporate interests, but rather was largely ignored by large record companies and performance venues. In this respect, Japanese hip-hop offers a representation of cultural globalization, as it expanded despite criticism on the part of record companies and major media outlets. The <b>history</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> certain kinds of cultural exchange are not initiated through cultural understanding, but instead from some interaction that can incite a desire to learn, to participate, and to contribute individuality. In Japan, this motivation to represent individuality was breakdancing, {{which was one of the}} leading edges of hip-hop at the time.|$|E

25|$|Anawrahta's first acts as king were to {{organize}} his kingdom. He graded every town and village {{according to the}} levy it could raise. He made great efforts to turn the arid parched lands of central Burma into a rice granary. He constructed the irrigation system, which is still used in Upper Burma today. He repaired the Meiktila Lake, and successfully built four weirs and canals (Kinda, Nga Laingzin, Pyaungbya, Kume) on the Panlaung river, and three weirs (Nwadet, Kunhse, Nga Pyaung) on the Zawgyi. (He also tried to control the Myitnge river but failed despite all his efforts. The work lasted three years {{and there were many}} casualties from fever.) He peopled the newly developed areas with villages, which under royal officers served the canals. The region, known as Ledwin (lit. the rice country) became the granary, the economic key of the north country. <b>History</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> one who gained control of Kyaukse became kingmaker in Upper Burma.|$|E
500|$|McCartney {{ventured into}} orchestral music in 1991, when the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Society {{commissioned}} a musical piece by him to celebrate its sesquicentennial. He collaborated with composer Carl Davis, producing Liverpool Oratorio. The performance featured opera singers Kiri Te Kanawa, Sally Burgess, Jerry Hadley and Willard White, with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir of Liverpool Cathedral. Reviews were negative. The Guardian was especially critical, describing the music as [...] "afraid of anything approaching a fast tempo", and {{adding that the}} piece has [...] "little {{awareness of the need}} for recurrent ideas that will bind the work into a whole". The paper published a letter McCartney submitted in response in which he noted several of the work's faster tempos and added, [...] "happily, <b>history</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> many good pieces of music were not liked by the critics of the time so I am content to... let people judge for themselves the merits of the work." [...] The New York Times was slightly more generous, stating, [...] "There are moments of beauty and pleasure in this dramatic miscellany... the music's innocent sincerity makes it difficult to be put off by its ambitions". Performed around the world after its London premiere, the Liverpool Oratorio reached number one on the UK classical chart, Music Week.|$|E

2500|$|This match {{will always}} be remembered as [...] "Taylor's match". When the team for the Test was announced, the Australian {{selectors}} had included the name of Peter Taylor from NSW. Thinking that a mistake in names had been made, the Australian media besieged {{the home of the}} talented young NSW opener Mark Taylor, thinking that he had been selected to play his first Test. Although <b>history</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> Mark Taylor had a substantial Test career later on, the selectors had made no mistake in the name. NSW off-spinner Peter Taylor had impressed some selectors (especially Greg Chappell) with his all-round abilities during the previous season's Sheffield Shield final. He was noted as an off-spinner who really spun the ball and a number of the wickets he took during the test match were attributed to his 'loop' (the deceptive flight of a heavily spun cricket ball) and bounce from his unusual but high bowling action. Considering Peter Taylor's limited first-class experience, the selection was risky. Given the state of Australian cricket at this point, {{and the fact that the}} Ashes had already been lost, such a selection could be considered desperate. The selection was so shocking that the media quickly dubbed him [...] "Peter Who?", and he became something of a celebrity leading up to the match. Spectators voiced their opinion too on the first day of the match. [...] "Aussie Selectors couldn't pick Bill Lawry's Nose" [...] declared one banner. No doubt these same spectators would have been cheering 5 days later as this unlikely player received the man of the match award.|$|E
