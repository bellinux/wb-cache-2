5|$|Solis's {{confirmation}} hearings were held on January 9, 2009, before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Committee chair Ted Kennedy repeatedly praised her, while, despite examination by Republican members, Solis <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> specific policy issues, including the Employee Free Choice Act. Several days later, Senate Republicans said they {{might try to}} put a procedural hold on her nomination because of her unwillingness to answer questions in detail in the hearings. By January 23, a secret hold {{was placed on the}} nomination by an anonymous Republican. A series of written questions and responses between Republican members and Solis followed, during which she was more forthcoming. Republican Mike Enzi pressed her on whether her unpaid high-level positions at American Rights at Work constituted prohibited lobbying activity; Solis denied violation of rules of conduct and stated she had not helped lobbying. Solis did acknowledge that she had failed to report those positions on her annual House financial disclosure forms at the time, which a White House spokesperson argued was an unintentional oversight. On February 2, Obama appointed veteran Labor Department official Edward C. Hugler as Acting Secretary. The prolonged process was considered by some Republican aides to be a preview of future battles on labor issues between the Obama administration and Republicans in Congress.|$|E

25|$|After his {{retirement}} from the WFM, Ed Boyce attended several more WFM conventions. He supported the WFM's {{creation of the}} Industrial Workers of the World in 1905, and testified on behalf of Haywood, Moyer and others at their 1907 murder trial. But Boyce gradually separated himself from organized labor, and eventually <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> his part in the miners' union.|$|E
25|$|In 2011 the FFRF was {{contacted}} {{by a local}} Austin citizen regarding the placement of a nativity scene on Henderson County courthouse property. A letter of complaint was sent. After {{it was decided that}} the nativity scene would remain, the FFRF petitioned to have its own banner placed on the site, but county officials <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> its placement. The FFRF banner was placed without permission on the courthouse property, but was soon removed. In April 2012 the request to place the banner was denied.|$|E
25|$|Morphy {{was unable}} to {{successfully}} build a law practice after the war ended. His attempts to open a law office failed; when he had visitors, they invariably {{wanted to talk about}} chess, not their legal affairs. Financially secure thanks to his family fortune, Morphy essentially spent {{the rest of his life}} in idleness. Asked by admirers to return to chess competition, he refused. He did attend the New York Tournament of 1883 and met world champion Wilhelm Steinitz (who had tried unsuccessfully to get Morphy to agree to a match in the 1860s) there, but <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> chess with him.|$|E

25|$|In 1959, Sherman Fairchild {{exercised}} {{his right}} to purchase shares {{of the members of the}} traitorous eight. Jay Last recalled (in 2007) that this event happened too early and turned former partners into ordinary employees, destroying the team spirit. In November 1960, Tom Bay, the Vice President of Marketing at Fairchild, accused Last of squandering money and demanded termination of Last's project of developing integrated circuits. Moore refused to help Last, and Noyce <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the matter. This conflict was the last straw: on January 31, 1961 Last and Hoerni left Fairchild and to head Amelco, the microelectronics branch of Teledyne. Kleiner and Roberts joined them after a few weeks. Blank, Grinich, Moore and Noyce stayed with Fairchild. The traitorous eight split into two groups of four.|$|E
500|$|It drew {{attention}} because Moore had shot {{most of it}} on location at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland without permission from The Walt Disney Company, owner and operator of both parks. Due to Disney's reputation of being protective of its intellectual property, {{the cast and crew}} used guerrilla filmmaking techniques to avoid attracting attention, such as keeping their scripts on their iPhones and shooting on handheld video cameras similar to those used by park visitors. After principal photography was complete, Moore was so determined to keep the project a secret from Disney that he edited it in South Korea. Sundance similarly <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the film in detail before it was shown. It was called [...] "the ultimate guerrilla film".|$|E
500|$|Similar in size {{to earlier}} coastal defence ships but {{seaworthy}} for operations in the Black Sea, Rostislav was conceived in 1892 as a cheap and compact platform for 12-inch guns.

500|$|During season six production, {{residents}} of Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, complained that noise levels and swearing were unbearable and inappropriate {{for them and}} their children to listen to during the night. The residents called local law enforcement agencies four or five times to deal with the late-night disturbances. Clarissa Keller, a Sherman Oaks resident, complained that she had a six-year-old son and didn't want him to listen to the swearing. She set up a petition calling for a ban on all production companies in the Sherman Oaks hills. Location managers and production crew <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the neighbors' complaints. The Bad Girls Club permit required the entire production to abide by a [...] "minimum outdoor activity and noise" [...] rule, but local residents claimed that the show did not keep noise levels down. The house for season six was rented for $20,000 a month. The owner said that he would not allow this type of production to rent his home in the future.|$|E
500|$|Garrido {{repeatedly}} {{told the}} reporter how he [...] "filed documents" [...] with the FBI on August 24, 2009, which, {{when they were}} published, would cause people to [...] "fall over backwards", {{and that he could}} not reveal more because he [...] "had to protect law enforcement", and [...] "what happened" [...] was [...] "something that humans have not understood well". In the interview, Garrido denied he had ever harmed Dugard's two daughters. He said their births changed his life and: [...] "they slept in my arms every single night since birth. I never touched them." [...] On August 28, 2009, FBI spokesman Joseph Schadler confirmed that Garrido had indeed left the documents with the agency, as he had claimed, but <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> further details. The document, titled Origin of Schizophrenia Revealed, was eventually released by the FBI. It is about stopping schizophrenics from turning violent and controlling sounds with the human mind.|$|E
500|$|Paramedics {{responding}} to the emergency call [...] "found the three residents’ calm behavior unusual; none was screaming or even helping direct the paramedics." [...] According to Ward's attorney, detectives who interrogated the three housemates {{on the night of}} the murder informed them that they were the main suspects in the case, and asked many sexually charged, accusatory questions. Three days after the murder, the Gay and Lesbian Liaison Unit of the D.C. police were called in, but unit head Sgt. Brett Parson <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the unit's involvement. Within two weeks of the murder, police publicly alleged that the crime scene had been tampered with. Investigators spent more than three weeks examining the townhouse in detail, [...] "removing flooring, pieces of walls, a chunk of staircase, the washing machine, even sink traps." [...] Allegations that the area around Wone's body had been cleaned were revealed in an affidavit in support of a search warrant for homeowner Joseph Price's offices at the D.C. law firm of Arent Fox.|$|E

5000|$|In the US, {{there are}} {{independent}} or ideologically associated [...] "think tanks", {{and there are}} government contract research organizations both not-for-profit and for-profit. In China, the primary difference between these Chinese institutes and American research institutes is their [...] "ownership."

500|$|The new candle {{sustained}} {{some minor}} damage over its first few years. On November 20, 1970, heavy rain and inclement weather snapped a wire helping keep the structure in place, and firefighters had to install additional braces the next day. Also that year, about 75 lights {{were stolen from}} the decorative Christmas trees set up around the candle's base. In 1971, the building where the Peace Candle was stored was broken into and the fiberglass paneling was vandalized. Easton officials <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> {{the extent of the}} damage, but Henry Schultz dismissed the vandals as [...] "kids". In 1974, the Peace Candle was only lit a few hours a night, and not at all on some nights, due to an ongoing energy crisis, which prompted the Metropolitan Edison Company to ask its Easton area customers not to use Christmas lights that year. Since the Peace Candle was seldom lit, charitable donations dropped in 1974, resulting in an $800 defect for the Easton Area Christmas Committee. Additionally the committee [...] spent $1,700 in Peace Candle Christmas cards meant to bring in donations, but only 500 packs were sold at $1 each. The use of less electricity to light the Peace Candle did not help the committee because the city paid the lighting bill.|$|E
500|$|A {{third and}} final album was again helmed by David Kahne, which Allmusic writer Stewart Mason speculated was a [...] "reaction against the more {{commercial}} sound of Benefactor. By this time, Carter {{had been replaced by}} veteran session drummer Aaron Smith. Instincts was released in October 1984, debuted at No.68 on the Billboard 200, and proved to be the band's best-selling album. It also launched their most successful single, [...] "A Girl in Trouble (Is a Temporary Thing)," [...] which broke the Billboard Top 40 and peaked at No.35. Critical reactions were positive. Despite being the band's most successful effort to date, Columbia pulled the band's promotional support while on a nationwide tour. [...] "The very next town we got to after they made that decision, there wasn't an A person there," [...] said Iyall. [...] " [...] was no local person there, there were no interviews and in-stores arranged as they had been. All that just ground to a halt." [...] Iyall also revealed during that tour that she had signed with her own manager, David Rubinson, and would be leaving the band {{at the end of the}} tour. The band stayed together for a European tour at the beginning of 1985 and upon returning to San Francisco, Iyall quit the band to pursue a solo career. Constant touring has been cited by Iyall as the primary reason for the break-up. [...] "You get tired of each other, and you get intolerant of being uncomfortable and away from your family and your friends." [...] According to a VH1 reunion episode, the issue of Iyall's weight was the reason for the label dropping them. In 2003, Iyall agreed with this claim: [...] "Howie sold us from 415 to Columbia Records, and they were like 'Who's this fat chick?' They decided that was as far as it was going to get, and pulled their support." [...] Crawdaddy! writer Denise Sullivan stated that the label spoke to Iyall about losing weight, but she subsequently refused. In 2010, Iyall <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the issue, but added that she may not be taking full responsibility in the matter.|$|E
2500|$|Amine Gemayel {{focused on}} {{securing}} {{the withdrawal of}} Israeli and Syrian forces. [...] A May 17, 1983, agreement among Lebanon, Israel, and the United States arranged an Israeli withdrawal conditional on the departure of Syrian troops. Syria opposed the agreement and <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the withdrawal of its troops, effectively stalemating further progress.|$|E

2500|$|The Clintons' {{decision}} to remove Chelsea from public schooling and {{send her to}} Sidwell Friends School, a private school in Washington,D.C., drew criticism. While several children of sitting presidents have attended Sidwell, the most recent prior child, Amy Carter, had gone to D.C. public schools. In a 1993 CBS This Morning town meeting, Bill defended the choice, stating that Chelsea did not like [...] "getting a lot of publicity" [...] and would have [...] "more control over her destiny" [...] at Sidwell. Bill explained that they made their decision {{in an effort to}} protect Chelsea's privacy; they did not [...] "reject the public schools." [...] Sidwell's students and staff remained silent regarding Chelsea, <b>declining</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> her publicly. A veteran of Model United Nations, Clinton was a 1997 National Merit Scholarship semifinalist. She graduated from Sidwell Friends in 1997; her father spoke at the graduation ceremony.|$|R
