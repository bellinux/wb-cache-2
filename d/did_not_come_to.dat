The monarchy invited the public to attend the first-night lighting ceremonies, and 5,000 people showed up. The Royal Hawaiian Band entertained, refreshments were served, and the King on horseback paraded his troops around the grounds.|$|E
5|$|Winton's efforts <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> public light until 1988, {{when his}} wife {{discovered}} papers in their loft, whereupon Winton began to publicly talk about his work, {{and he came to}} be known as the 'British Schindler', in comparison to Oskar Schindler. Sir Nicholas himself believed this was undeserved, because unlike Schindler, his life had never been in danger.|$|E

5|$|As {{they had}} not yet been {{approved}} by 11 of the 14 states, the ratification of Article One (ratified by 10) and Article Two (ratified by 6) remained incomplete. The ratification plateau they needed to reach soon rose to 12 of 15 states when Kentucky joined the Union (June 1, 1792). On June 27, 1792, the Kentucky General Assembly ratified all 12 amendments, however this action <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> light until 1996.|$|E
5|$|Central Area Command was one {{of several}} {{geographically}} based commands raised by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World War II. It was formed in March 1940, and covered the central portion of New South Wales. Headquartered at Sydney, Central Area Command was primarily responsible for air defence, aerial reconnaissance and protection of the sea lanes within its boundaries. It was disbanded in August 1941 and control of its units taken over by other RAAF formations. Proposals in 1943â€“44 to raise a new Central Area Command <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> fruition.|$|E
5|$|In November 1953, it was {{suggested}} that the existing two episodes could be combined and followed with a condensed live production of {{the latter part of the}} story for a special Christmas omnibus repeat of the serial. This idea was abandoned. Although Cartier and star Reginald Tate were keen to make an all-film omnibus version for television, this also <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> fruition. In 1963, one of the existing episodes was selected as a representative of early British programming for the Festival of World Television at the National Film Theatre in London.|$|E

5|$|In the 1st century BCE and {{the first}} half of that century, it was the Mediterranean port of the Nabateans, whose caravans arrived there from Petra or from Elath on the Red Sea. In 96 BCE, the Hasmonean king Alexander Jannaeus besieged the city for a year. The inhabitants, who had hoped for help from the Nabatean king Aretas II, were killed and their city {{destroyed}} by Jannaeus when Aretas <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> their aid.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} how much impact Zeppelin had on German {{response}} in the region, though {{the aims of the}} deception were achieved (tying up German defensive forces in the Mediterranean beyond D-Day). Post-war analysis of German intelligence documents indicated that they did overstate Allied forces in the way Zeppelin intended. However, the German high command <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> expect a major invasion in the Balkans.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the end of}} 1982, Ontario Minister of Transportation and Communications James W. Snow {{announced}} the launching of GO-ALRT (Advanced Light Rail Transit), an interregional light rail transit program providing $2.6 billion (1980 dollars) of infrastructure. Although this plan <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> fruition, certain key objectives from it were established in other ways: additional stations were built, all-day service to Whitby and Burlington was established and networks of buses and trains interconnected the network.|$|E
5|$|The album's {{writing process}} started in November 2011, {{announced}} by Lombardo through Twitter. King later {{said that he}} and Lombardo had been working on music prior to the holidays and that they had completed three songs, in addition to three outtakes from the previous record. It was initially hoped that the album would be ready for release by summer of 2012, but this <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> fruition. Frontman Tom Araya later said that the album would be pushed back to a 2013 release, but this idea fell through.|$|E

On the February 17 episode of Raw, Christian attacked Daniel Bryan from behind while he was distracted by Kane and mocked Bryan during the match, making him a heel. At Elimination Chamber, Christian eliminated Sheamus before being eliminated himself by Bryan. On the March 24 episode of Raw, Christian won a fatal four-way match including Alberto Del Rio, Dolph Ziggler and Sheamus to challenge Big E for the WWE Intercontinental Championship, which <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> fruition due to Christian suffering a concussion and this was his final match.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Love Productions {{approached}} the BBC {{with the idea}} for a programme that would feature a prominent member of the business community working with unemployed people, but the show <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> fruition after the unnamed individual had to withdraw from it because of other commitments. The format for the series that would later become Benefits Street was then suggested, but the BBC declined to commission the series because it was producing a number of other programmes concerning similar issues, such as People Like Us and Nick and Margaret: We All Pay Your Benefits. Love Productions then suggested the format to Channel 4, who agreed to commission the programme.|$|E
5|$|On 27 June, the division's {{defensive}} {{positions at}} Minqar Qaim were encircled by the 21st Panzer Division. The battalion {{was the lead}} unit {{of one of the}} columns, numbering 900 vehicles and guns, of the division, in the subsequent breakout that night. In the course of this movement, Gray's column ran into an encampment of tanks of the 21st Panzer Division. However, the Germans failed to capitalise on the opportunity and the train of vehicles, with Gray at its head to ensure it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> a stop, was able to skirt the panzers with relatively few losses and reach the Alamein lines.|$|E

5|$|SR56 {{was added}} to the state highway system in 1959 as Legislative Route278, and was renumbered SR56 in the 1964 state highway renumbering. Plans in 1964 were to connect SR56 to the north end of SR125 and {{continue}} east to SR67, but these plans <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> fruition. The eastern end from Black Mountain Road to I-15 was completed in 1993; the western end from I-5 to Carmel Creek Road was completed in 1995 after several lawsuits filed by the Sierra Club and other community groups. The two ends were not connected until the middle portion of the freeway was completed in 2004. The delay was largely due to funding issues and environmental concerns.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} arrival of the Belgian {{government}} in exile in London, negotiations began between the Belgians and the British about the role which the Congo would play in the Allied war effort. The British were determined that the Congo should not fall into Axis hands, and planned to invade and occupy the colony if the Belgians <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> an arrangement. This was particularly because, after the fall of Dutch and British colonies in the Far East to Japan, the Allies were desperate for raw materials like rubber which the Congo could produce in abundance. Eventually, the two parties came to an arrangement in which all the British demands were accepted, including a 30 percent devaluation of the Congolese franc.|$|E
5|$|The family's {{frequent}} moves later spawned {{accusations that}} Chester Arthur {{was not a}} native-born citizen of the United States. When Arthur was nominated for vice president in 1880, a New York attorney and political opponent, Arthur P. Hinman, initially speculated that Arthur was born in Ireland and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the United States until he was fourteen years old. Had that been true, opponents might have argued that Arthur was constitutionally ineligible for the vice presidency under the United States Constitution's natural-born-citizen clause. When Hinman's original story did not take root, he spread a new rumor that Arthur was born in Canada. This claim, too, failed to gain credence.|$|E
