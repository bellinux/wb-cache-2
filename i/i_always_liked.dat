25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked,</b> the kind of comic books <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked,</b> were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E
500|$|Katherine Tina Valentine was {{introduced}} by former executive producer Edward J. Scott, born onscreen during the episode that aired July 30, 1990. She was portrayed by twins Darla and Sandra Greer from 1990 to 1991, with child actress Danielle Ryah taking over the role briefly in 1994. Upon the character's re-introduction as an adult by executive producer Maria Arena Bell on February 6, 2008, actress Elizabeth Hendrickson assumed the role. Hendrickson was previously known {{for her role as}} Maggie Stone on All My Children, one half of the iconic Bianca Montgomery and Maggie Stone lesbian supercouple. Having been offered the part in 2007 as a ten-episode guest stint, she was soon promoted to a contract status. Reflecting on her casting, Hendrickson described the process as a [...] "lovely surprise" [...] and said, [...] "I used to always watch Y when I was on AMC. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> {{the look and feel of}} the show, so I’ve always been a big fan. Chloe wasn’t even on the page when I came in for a chemistry audition." [...] As a result of the character's positive response, Bell decided to write Chloe's backstory which revealed her to be the daughter of long-running character Esther Valentine (Kate Linder) while also providing her with additional storyline. [...] "Everyone is so pleasant here and it's such a great, warm environment and it just feels really right. If they ask me to stay that would be a blessing," [...] Hendrickson said, before being offered a contract. In March 2014, following increased speculation, Hendrickson confirmed her exit from the series, stating: [...] "I need to stretch my wings and fly into the unknown. The one thing that remains true and what I will hold close to my heart as I embark on this new adventure is that I will ALWAYS have you." [...] She made her last appearance on May 27, 2014. Hendrickson reprised the role for one episode on October 14, 2014 to commemorate the passing of Chloe's daughter, Delia. In October 2015, Hendrickson also reprised the role of Chloe from October 12 to 28.|$|E

2500|$|At the 2009 Grammy Awards, Nas {{confirmed}} he was collaborating on {{an album}} with reggae singer Damian Marley which {{was expected to}} be released in the fall of 2009. Nas said of the collaboration in an interview [...] "I was a big fan of his father and of course all the children, all the offspring, and Damian, I kind of looked at Damian as a rap guy. His stuff is not really singing, or if he does, it comes off more hard, like on some street shit. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> how reggae and hip-hop have always been intertwined and always kind of pushed each other, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> the connection. I'd worked with people before from the reggae world but when I worked with Damian, the whole workout was perfect". A portion of the profit was planned to go towards building a school in Africa. He {{went on to say that}} it was [...] "too early to tell the title or anything like that". The Los Angeles Times reported that the album would be titled Distant Relatives.|$|E

The first site to receive the award was Immeritus, a fan site mostly devoted to Sirius Black, and about which Rowling wrote, [...] "I am so {{proud of the fact}} that a character, whom <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> very much, though he never appeared as much more than a brooding presence in the books, has gained a passionate fan-club." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite the lukewarm {{response}} to , Spielberg's theatrical {{homage to the}} original series, CBS gave the new Twilight Zone a greenlight in 1984 {{under the supervision of}} Carla Singer, then Vice President of Drama Development. [...] "The Twilight Zone was a series <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> as a kid," [...] said Singer, [...] "...and at that point it sounded like an interesting challenge for me personally." [...] These sentiments were seconded by a number of young filmmakers eager to make their mark on a series which had proved influential to their life and work—people like writers Harlan Ellison, George R. R. Martin, Rockne S. O'Bannon, Jeremy Bertrand Finch, Paul Chitlik and directors Wes Craven and William Friedkin. Casts featured stars including Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, Season Hubley, Morgan Freeman, Martin Landau, Jonathan Frakes, and Fred Savage.|$|E

He {{grew up on a}} trailer park, living a [...] "gypsy life", and often pretended to be Romário while playing {{football}}. It was at the trailer park that he learned how to play football and, at the age of ten, he joined the AFC Ajax Academy. Van der Vaart has said of his upbringing, [...] "That was the way my family lived. My father was born there and it is a lifestyle. Maybe it is not a normal lifestyle but <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> it. I always played football on the street. It was an easy life, then I was 10 years old and went to Ajax and played there for almost 12 years." ...|$|E

As a result, she developed a soulful style of singing like her idols. [...] "My first CD that I owned was Aretha Franklin: Greatest Hits. And I saw the advert on TV and it was just like little clips of her songs. I had no idea who she was—I was only like 10 so. I said, 'Oh yeah, that looks really good', so I wrote it down and I said to my mum, 'Can I have that for Christmas?' So she told my friend Dennis, who always gets me good music anyway, and he got that for me. So that was one of my first albums that I loved." [...] She would later tell MTV News: [...] "I kind of clicked into soul music more than anything else because of the vocals. You've got to have good vocals to sing soul music and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> it ever since I was little." ...|$|E

[...] I neither {{received}} an offer direct or indirect from Yost nor any agent. [...] I went to Michigan because several lawyers in my native town were graduates of that university and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> the place. [...] I do not regret my choice. [...] If President Jordan will talk facts rather than trash, he will change his attitude on my standing in college, so far as Michigan is concerned. [...] At Stanford I was only a special and I do not deny that my work was not of a high order. [...] At Michigan I never flunked during my entire course, and what the conditions were against me when I entered I made up by working hard in summer school. ... I owe it to Michigan and athletics in general to state definitely that I did not receive one cent in connection with athletics while I was in Michigan." ...|$|E
