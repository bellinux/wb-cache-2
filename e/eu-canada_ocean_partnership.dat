Within the last decade, {{there have been}} a significant number of laboratory and field observations within rip current systems. An overview of rip current kinematics based on these observations and the scientific advances obtained from these efforts are synthesized. Rip current flows are partitioned into mean, infragravity, very low frequency (vorticity), and tidal contributions, and it is found that each contributes significantly to the total. Data from the laboratory and the field suggest that the rip current strength increases with increasing wave energy and decreasing water depths. The maximum mean current occurs inside the surf zone, where the maximum forcing is present owing to the dissipation of waves.

Simultaneous high resolution sampling of predator behavior and habitat characteristics is often difficult to achieve despite its importance in understanding the foraging decisions and habitat use of predators. Here we tap into the biosonar system of Blainville's beaked whales, Mesoplodon densirostris, using sound and orientation recording tags to uncover prey-finding cues available to echolocating predators in the deep-sea. Echolocation sounds indicate where whales search and encounter prey, as well as the altitude of whales above the sea-floor and the density of organisms around them, providing a link between foraging activity and the bio-physical environment. Tagged whales (n = 9) hunted exclusively at depth, investing most of their search time either in {{the lower part of the}} deep scattering layer (DSL) or near the sea-floor with little diel change. At least 43 % (420 / 974) of recorded prey-capture attempts were performed within the benthic boundary layer despite a wide range of dive depths, and many dives included both meso-and bentho-pelagic foraging. Blainville's beaked whales only initiate searching when already deep in the descent and encounter prey suitable for capture within 2 min of the start of echolocation, suggesting that these whales are accessing prey in reliable vertical strata. Moreover, these prey resources are sufficiently dense to feed the animals in what is effectively four hours of hunting per day enabling a strategy in which long dives to exploit numerous deep-prey with low nutritional value require protracted recovery periods (average 1. 5 h) between dives. This apparent searching efficiency maybe aided by inhabiting steep undersea slopes with access to both the DSL and the sea-floor over small spatial scales. Aggregations of prey in these biotopes are located using biosonar-derived landmarks and represent stable and abundant resources for Blainville's beaked whales in the otherwise food-limited deep-ocean.

40|$|International audienceSymbiotic {{relationships}} are widespread {{in nature and}} are fundamental for ecosystem functioning {{and the evolution of}} biodiversity. In marine environments, photosymbiosis with microalgae is best known for sustaining benthic coral reef ecosystems. Despite the importance of oceanic microbiota in global ecology and biogeochemical cycles, symbioses are poorly characterized in open ocean plankton. Here, we describe a widespread symbiotic association between Acantharia biomineralizing microorganisms that are abundant grazers in plankton communities, and members of the haptophyte genus Phaeocystis that are cosmopolitan bloom-forming microalgae. Cophylogenetic analyses demonstrate that symbiont biogeography, rather than host taxonomy, is the main determinant of the association. Molecular dating places the origin of this photosymbiosis in the Jurassic (ca. 175 Mya), a period of accentuated marine oligotrophy. Measurements of intracellular dimethylated sulfur indicate that the host likely profits from antioxidant protection provided by the symbionts as an adaptation to life in transparent oligotrophic surface waters. In contrast to terrestrial and marine symbioses characterized to date, the symbiont reported in this association is extremely abundant and ecologically active in its free-living phase. In the vast and barren open <b>ocean,</b> <b>partnership</b> with photosymbionts that have extensive free-living populations is likely an advantageous strategy for hosts that rely on such interactions.

The measurements were obtained during the RIP-current EXperiment (RIPEX) {{in concert with the}} Steep Beach Experiment (SBE) performed at Sand City, Monterey Bay, CA, during the spring of 2001. The nearshore bathymetry was made up of shore-connected shoals incised by relatively narrow rip-channels spaced approximately 125 m apart. The comparison considers a 20 -day period during which significant changes in both the offshore wave climate and nearshore bathymetry occurred. The temporal variation in infragravity conditions during the experiment is strong, with computational results typically explaining 70 % to 80 % of the observed infragravity motions within the nearshore. In contrast to the temporal variation, the alongshore spatial variation in infragravity intensity during the experiment is generally weak, even though the underlying bathymetry shows strong depth variations. Model computations suggest preferential coupling between the computed edge wave motions and the quasi-periodic bathymetry is present, a prerequisite for strong spatial variability. However, the infragravity field is dominated by cross-shore infragravity motions, which are only weakly coupled to the quasiperiodic bathymetry, resulting in a weak alongshore variability of the total infragravity motions.

When propagating freely in the deep ocean, these waves are typically small, several centimeters at most, so they have been seldom studied. In the context of future wide-swath altimetry missions, these waves need to be better quantified as they have wavelengths that will be resolved by such instruments. Here, we analyze the global climatology and variability of infragravity waves in the deep ocean using data from over 40 open ocean locations, with depths larger than 2000 m. We show that typical infragravity wave heights are higher than previously estimated, with winter-averaged values up to 11 mm off the U. S. West Coast, and typically less than 6 mm in the tropics. The mid to high latitudes exhibit a strong seasonal cycle consistent with the local variability of the wind-waves, while the tropical Pacific has a higher energy level during the Austral winter that does not correlate well with the local wind-waves, suggesting a remote source for the recorded infragravity waves. These infragravity wave energies are expected to be a significant contribution to the error budget for possible measurements of sea level associated to sub-mesoscale currents at horizontal scales around 10 km. Hence, a global numerical model of infragravity waves will likely be necessary for the analysis of the planned Surface Water Ocean Topography mission...|$|R

40|$|Published by and {{copyright}} by Public Library of Science (PLoS) The {{mesopelagic zone}} of the northeast Pacific Ocean is an important foraging habitat for many predators, yet few studies have addressed the factors driving basin-scale predator distributions or inter-annual variability in foraging and breeding success. Understanding these processes is critical to reveal how conditions at sea cascade to population-level effects. To begin addressing these challenging questions, we collected diving, tracking, foraging success, and natality data for 297 adult female northern elephant seal migrations from 2004 to 2010. During the longer post-molting migration, individual energy gain rates were significant predictors of pregnancy. At sea, seals focused their foraging effort along a narrow band corresponding to {{the boundary between the}} sub-arctic and sub-tropical gyres. In contrast to shallow-diving predators, elephant seals target the gyre-gyre boundary throughout the year rather than follow the southward winter migration of surface features, such as the Transition Zone Chlorophyll Front. We also assessed the impact of added transit costs by studying seals at a colony near the southern extent of the species??? range, 1, 150 km to the south. A much larger proportion of seals foraged locally, implying plasticity in foraging strategies and possibly prey type. While these findings are derived from a single species, the results may provide insight to the foraging patterns of many other meso-pelagic predators in the northeast Pacific Ocean.

The definitive {{version of}} this article is available at: [URL] organic pollutants, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), are widely distributed and detectable far from anthropogenic sources. Northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) biannually travel thousands of kilometers to forage in coastal and open-ocean regions of the northeast Pacific Ocean and then return to land where they fast while breeding and molting. Our study examined potential effects of age, adipose percent, and the difference between the breeding and molting fasts on PCB concentrations and congener profiles in blubber and serum of northern elephant seal females. Between 2005 and 2007, we sampled blubber and blood from 58 seals before and after a foraging trip, which were then analyzed for PCBs. Age did not significantly affect total PCB concentrations; however, the proportion of PCB congeners with different numbers of chlorine atoms was significantly affected by age, especially in the outer blubber. Younger adult females had a significantly greater proportion of low-chlorinated PCBs (tri-, tetra-, and penta-CBs) than older females, with the opposite trend observed for hepta-CBs, indicating that an age-associated process such as parity (birth) may significantly affect congener profiles. The percent of adipose tissue had a significant relationship with inner blubber PCB concentrations, with the highest mean concentrations observed {{at the end of the}} molting fast. These results highlight the importance of sampling across the entire blubber layer when assessing contaminant levels in phocid seals and taking into account the adipose stores and reproductive status of an animal when conducting contaminant researchThis research was conducted as part of the Tagging of Pacific Predators (TOPP) program and was supported in part by the National <b>Ocean</b> <b>Partnership</b> Program (N 00014 - 02 - 1 - 1012); the Office of Naval Research (N 00014 - 00 - 10880, N 00014 - 03 - 1 - 0651, N 00014 - 08 - 1 - 1195, and N 00014 - 10 - 1 - 0356); the E&P Sound and Marine Life Joint Industry Project of the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (JIP 2207 ??? 23); the Moore, Packard, and Sloan Foundations; the Ida Benson Lynn Endowed Chair in Ocean Health; Steve Blank.

The definitive {{version of}} this article is available at: [URL] ARGOS satellite telemetry {{is one of the most}} widely used methods to track the movements of free-ranging marine and terrestrial animals and is fundamental to studies of foraging ecology, migratory behavior and habitat-use. ARGOS location estimates do not include complete error estimations, and for many marine organisms, the most commonly acquired locations (Location Class 0, A, B, or Z) are provided with no declared error estimate. Methodology/Principal Findings: We compared the accuracy of ARGOS locations to those obtained using Fastloc GPS from the same electronic tags on five species of pinnipeds: 9 California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), 4 Galapagos sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki), 6 Cape fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus), 3 Australian fur seals (A. p. doriferus) and 5 northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris). These species encompass a range of marine habitats (highly pelagic vs coastal), diving behaviors (mean dive durations 2 ??? 21 min) and range of latitudes (equator to temperate). A total of 7, 318 ARGOS positions and 27, 046 GPS positions were collected. Of these, 1, 105 ARGOS positions were obtained within five minutes of a GPS position and were used for comparison. The 68 th percentile ARGOS location errors as measured in this study were LC- 3 0. 49 km, LC- 2 1. 01 km, LC- 1 1. 20 km, LC- 0 4. 18 km, LC-A 6. 19 km, LC-B 10. 28 km. Conclusions/Significance: The ARGOS errors measured here are greater than those provided by ARGOS, but within the range of other studies. The error was non-normally distributed with each LC highly right-skewed. Locations of species that make short duration dives and spend extended periods on the surface (sea lions and fur seals) had less error than species like elephant seals that spend more time underwater and have shorter surface intervals. Supplemental data (S 1) are provided allowing the creation of density distributions that can be used in a variety of filtering algorithms to improve the quality of ARGOS tracking data.

40|$|The Southern <b>Ocean</b> Research <b>Partnership</b> (SORP) is an {{international}} collaborative initiative to develop novel research techniques and conduct non-lethal research on whales in the Southern Ocean. One of SORP’s original five research projects is the Blue and Fin Whale Acoustic Trends Project which aims to implement a long term acoustic research program examining trends in Southern Ocean blue and fin whale population growth, distribution, and seasonal presence using passive acoustic monitoring techniques. Passive acoustic monitoring is a robust means of monitoring whales in remote and difficult to study {{areas such as the}} Antarctic over long time periods. Analysis {{of a wide range of}} available passive acoustic data has demonstrated spatial and temporal patterns in the occurrence of blue and fin whales in the Southern Ocean. However, the lack of overlap in years and locations monitored, and differences among instrumentation and analysis methods used, underlines the need for coordinated effort. To best exploit passive acoustic methods for monitoring purposes in the future, the SORP Acoustic Trends steering group proposes the placement and maintenance of a pan-Antarctic monitoring system with consistent spatial and temporal coverage in each of the six IWC management areas. Further, blueprints for instrument choice, hardware configurations and analysis methods are being prepared to suggest how data might be best collected and analyzed in a uniform manner to best address the specific research questions for each study species. Through a consistent multi-disciplinary approach with international collaborators, the Blue and Fin Whale Acoustic Trends Project aims to use passive acoustic recordings to measure long term distribution, seasonal occurrence, and population growth trends of fin and Antarctic blue whales in the Southern Ocean...|$|R
40|$|Eleven {{satellite}} tagswere deployed on 9 killerwhales at the Prince Edwards Islands in the Southern Ocean. Statespace switchingmodelswere used {{to generate}} position estimates fromArgos location data,while two behavioural modes were estimated from the data. Individuals were tracked for 5. 6 – 53. 2 days, duringwhich time they moved 416 – 4470 km (mean 82. 7 km day− 1) but 69 % of position estimates were within the 1000 m depth contour around the islands (b 35 km from the tagging site). Killerwhales showed restricted behaviour close to the islands, particularly inshorewhere they can effectively hunt seals and penguins, and at seamounts {{to the north of}} the islands. Generalised linear mixed effect models were used to explore the relationship between environmental variables and behavioural mode. The best model included depth, sea surface temperature, latitude, sea surface height anomaly and bottomslope, but killerwhales did not clearly target features such as fronts and apparentmesoscale eddies. Killer whales showed restricted behaviour in shallow water, at high latitudes and low sea surface temperature — the conditions characterising the archipelago. Dive data fromtwo individuals largely revealed shallow dives (7. 5 – 50 mdeep), but deeper dive bouts to around 368 mwere also recorded. Diveswere significantly deeper during the day and maximumdive depthswere 767. 5 and 499. 5 m, respectively. This suggests that killer whales might also prey on vertically migrating cephalopods and perhaps Patagonian toothfish.

40|$|Diet {{seems to}} be a key factor driving {{diversity}} and isolation among killer whale populations. Killer whales at Marion Island, Southern Ocean, have been observed preying on seals and penguins but are also know to depredate Patagonian toothfish from longline fishing vessels. However, their diet is poorly known especially when they occur offshore. We analysed carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios in 32 skin samples collected from 24 killer whales belonging to 8 social units. Adult males showed higher δ 15 N values than adult females or subadults, indicating that they occupy a higher relative trophic level. There {{were no significant differences in}} δ 13 C among social units, but δ 15 N differed significantly and 2 individuals from social units which have been observed depredating Patagonian toothfish had higher δ 15 N values. The inshore presence of killer whales at Marion Island was a significant predictor of δ 13 C values, but not of δ 15 N values. This suggests some foraging north of Marion Island, potentially on lower trophic level prey. We also analysed tissue samples from seal, penguin and Patagonian toothfish prey and used available values for Antarctic fur seals. Results show that killer whales around Marion Island are apex predators, but that they do not feed exclusively on other high trophic level predators such as elephant seals, fur seals, and Patagonian toothfish. Killer whales had δ 15 N values similar to those of Patagonian toothfish and adult male elephant seals, implying that the diet of killer whales at Marion Island includes some lower trophic level prey such as cephalopods or fishes.

After such incidents, people often {{look no further than the}} immediate impact: death tolls of particular species are logged, population declines/increases recorded, and these figures are seen as broadly representative of the environmental damage. The toxicological work being conducted by Ocean Alliance and their partners at the Wise Lab was primarily aimed at determining the chronic, long-term impact of the incident-in particular the geno-toxic impacts of oil (and compounds found in oil) and dispersants as they work their way up the trophic food chain. The long-term effects are believed by many to be far more significant than the short-term effects, a belief corroborated by on-going research in the Gulf of Mexico and the fact that the impacts of the Exxon Valdez spill (which occurred in 1985 in Prince William Sound, Alaska) are still being studied over 25 years after the initial accident. In terms of total discharge of oil, this spill was approximately one tenth of the Deepwater Horizon spill. Perhaps the most significant economic impact of the Exxon Valdez disaster-the collapse of the Herring fishery, only collapsed four years after the spill, and to this day is not showing signs of recovery. This makes the kind of long-term focused program Ocean Alliance conducted all the more important. Preliminary analysis has shown potentially damaging levels of genotoxic metals including chromium and nickel in Sperm whales living in the area, significantly higher than the global average. Furthermore, it has shown a correlation between proximity to the spill and levels of these genotoxic metals.|$|R

In the southern Aegean Sea, seventeen of nineteen of the submarine volcanic cones of the Kolumbo Rift Zone have been explored for the first time. The hydrothermal vent field, crater walls, and flanks of Kolumbo underwater volcano have been mapped with sidescan sonar and sampled. In addition, a large debris avalanche field on the eastern flanks of Santorini volcano has been mapped with sidescan sonar, and explored and sampled using ROVs. Sidescan and ROV investigations on Eratosthenes Seamount in the eastern Mediterranean have revealed karst topography with sinkholes up to 50 m in diameter and 12 m deep atop the seamount, as well as vent/seep communities with populations of tube worms, bivalves, crabs, and bacteria on the slopes. Two shipwrecks were also discovered on top of Eratosthenes Seamount, likely dating to the Medieval period.
