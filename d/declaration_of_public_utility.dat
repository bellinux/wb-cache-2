50|$|The {{fortified}} camp of Toul anchors {{the end of}} the fortification {{curtain of}} the Hauts de Meuse. The 1874 <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Utility</b> that authorized construction envisioned four forts: Ecouvres, Dongermain, St.-Michel and Villey-le-Sec. Villey-le-Sec was planned to protect the southwestern approach to Toul, located on the plateau of Haye, supported on the south by the bluffs along the Moselle. The fort was originally planned to be about 1000 m further west, where the Chaudeney redoubt is located. The fort was responsible for the exits from the Forest of Haye, and to provide flanking support to the Fort de Gondreville and Fort de Chanot.|$|E
30|$|The {{value of}} identifying, {{analysing}} and continuously treating {{all types of}} risks from {{the outset of the}} project generally makes it possible for them to be anticipated. This systemic approach to risks also results in increasing the global performance of the project with regards cost, completion and quality criteria. This method is used by public and private clients as from the preliminary studies through to either the DUP (French <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>utility)</b> or the commissioning, depending on the chosen mode of financing. It is in addition to the studies provided for by the official consultation and project management procedure (outline proposals, impact assessment, public debate, public enquiry, final design, etc.).|$|E
30|$|The life of {{a project}} can easily attain 20 to 30  years between the {{political}} decision idea and the DUP (<b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>utility).</b> The commissioning process can also require several years. As a result, the socio-economic planning context permitting {{the definition of the}} project characteristics (method, capacity, on site development or new construction, route) is liable to change between the preliminary studies, the preliminary design file, the final draft design file and the commissioning. It is difficult for planners to provide a detailed forecast of lifestyles, demographic developments, growth of GDP and other variables that might influence traffic flows over 10, 15, 20  years or more. It should also be underlined that currently, mobility is characterised by a certain unpredictability because mobility practices change rapidly. Literature in the sector underlines this difficulty in predicting the future and, in particular, the creation of reliable traffic forecasts [3].|$|E
