6000|$|But it is {{very easy}} to outrun the sympathy of readers on this topic, which schoolmen called natura naturata, or nature passive. One can hardly speak {{directly}} of it without excess. It is as easy to broach in mixed companies what is called [...] "the subject of religion." [...] A susceptible person does not like to indulge his tastes in this kind without the apology of some trivial necessity: he goes to see a wood-lot, or to look at the crops, or to fetch a plant or a mineral from a remote locality, or he carries a fowling-piece or a fishing-rod. I suppose this shame must have a good reason. A dilettantism in nature is barren and unworthy. The fop of fields is no better than his brother of Broadway. Men are naturally hunters and inquisitive of wood-craft, and I suppose that such a gazetteer as wood-cutters and Indians should furnish facts for, would take place in the most sumptuous drawing-rooms of all the [...] "Wreaths" [...] and [...] "Flora's chaplets" [...] of the bookshops; yet ordinarily, whether we are too clumsy for so subtle a topic, or from whatever cause, as soon as men begin to write on nature, they fall into euphuism. Frivolity is a most unfit tribute to Pan, who ought to be represented in the mythology as the most continent of gods. I would not be frivolous before the admirable reserve and prudence of time, yet I cannot renounce the right of returning often to this old topic. The multitude of false churches accredits the true religion. Literature, poetry, science are the homage of man to this unfathomed secret, concerning which no sane man can affect an indifference or incuriosity. Nature is loved by what is best in us. It is loved as the city of God, although, or rather because there is no citizen. The sunset is unlike anything that is underneath it: it wants men. And the beauty of nature must always seem unreal and mocking, until the landscape has human figures that are as good as itself. If there were good men, there would never be this rapture in nature. If the king is in the palace, nobody looks at the walls. It is when he is gone, and the house is filled with grooms and gazers, that we turn from the people to find relief in the majestic men that are suggested by the pictures and the architecture. The critics who complain of the sickly separation of the beauty of nature from the thing to be done, must consider that our hunting of the picturesque is inseparable from our protest against false society. Man is fallen; nature is erect, and serves as a <b>differential</b> <b>thermometer,</b> detecting {{the presence or absence of}} the divine sentiment in man. By fault of our dulness and selfishness we are looking up to nature, but when we are convalescent, nature will look up to us. We see the foaming brook with compunction: if our own life flowed with the right energy, we should shame the brook. The stream of zeal sparkles with real fire, and not with reflex rays of sun and moon. Nature may be as selfishly studied as trade. Astronomy to the selfish becomes astrology; psychology, mesmerism (with intent to show where our spoons are gone); and anatomy and physiology become phrenology and palmistry.|$|E

40|$|The {{measurement}} of several concepts used in social sciences generates an ordinal variable, which {{is characterized by}} rawness of the output values and presents some much debated problems in data analysis. In fact, the need for effective analysis is easily satisfied with parametric models that deal with quantitative variables. However, the peculiarities of the ordinal scales, and the crude values produced by them, limit the use of parametric models, which has generated conflicting favourable and unfavourable views of the parametric approach. The main distinctive features of ordinal scales, {{some of which are}} critical points and nodal issues, are illustrated here along with the construction processes. Among the traditional procedures, the most common ordinal scales are described, including the Likert, semantic <b>differential,</b> feeling <b>thermometers,</b> and the Stapel scale. A relative new method, based on fuzzy sets, can be used to handle and generate ordinal variables. Therefore, the structure of a fuzzy inference system is exemplified in synthetic terms to show the treatment of ordinal variables to obtain one or more response variables. The nature of ordinal variables influences the interpretation and selection of many strategies used for their analysis. Four approaches are illustrated (nonparametric, parametric, latent variables, and fuzzy inference system), highlighting their potential and drawbacks. The modelling of an ordinal dependent variable (loglinear models, ordinary parametric models or logit and probit ordinal models, latent class models and hybrid models) is affected by the various approaches...|$|R
50|$|Leslie's main {{contributions}} to physics {{were made by}} the help of the <b>differential</b> <b>thermometer,</b> an instrument whose invention was contested with him by Count Rumford. By adapting to this instrument various ingenious devices, Leslie was able to employ it in a great variety of investigations, connected especially with photometry, hygroscopy and the temperature of space. In 1820 he was elected a corresponding member of the Institute of France, the only distinction of the kind which he valued, and early in 1832 he was knighted.|$|E

Shortly {{afterwards}} he published two small treatises on geometry (1833; 3rd edit. 1853) and the differential and integral calculus (1836; 2nd edit. 1847). He communicated to the Royal Society—of which he was elected a fellow—papers On the Elasticity of Threads of Glass and the Application of this Property to Torsion Balances, and also experimental researches on the electric and chemical theories of galvanism, on electromagnetism, and voltaic electricity.|$|E
50|$|It {{consists}} of a metallic cup standing upon a tall hollow pedestal, with a <b>differential</b> <b>thermometer</b> placed so {{that one of its}} bulbs is in the focus of the paraboloid formed by the cavity of the cup. The interior of the cup is highly polished and is kept covered by a plate of metal, being opened when an observation is made. The second bulb is always screened from the sky and so is not affected by the radiative effect of the clear sky, the action of which is concentrated upon the first bulb. The contraction of the air in the second bulb by its sudden exposure to a clear sky causes the liquid in the stem to rise.|$|E
40|$|A {{simple method}} for {{measuring}} joint inflammation with a <b>differential</b> thermistor probe <b>thermometer</b> {{was applied to}} acute synovitis of the knee. Temperature assessments were made immediately before and serially after intra-articular steroid therapy. The method was capable of showing {{a significant difference in}} temperature between inflamed and normal knees. Knee temperature assessments correlated well with clinical parameters and were essentially independent of room temperature. INFRA-RED thermography is being used as a means of objective assessment of joint inflammation (Haberman et ah, 1968). However it requires expensive apparatus, expertise in calibration and operation as well as a controlled environment since absolute temperatures are recorded. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the possibility of using a differential thermistor probe method bearing in mind the following features which one would like to incorporate into this type of objective measurement: 1. Ease of operation. 2. An appropriate temperature range. 3. Good correlation of temperature with clinical parameters...|$|R
40|$|By {{applying}} ultrasonic {{waves to}} the hydrous granular medium, experiments {{has been conducted}} in pursuing for the relations of its water contents to the differences of temperature rise between two positions owing to the heating effect of ultrasonic waves. Next, by heating it directly, the same relations as mentioned above has been probed. These results are as follows: 1. The differences of temperature, from at least 0. 06 °C to 6 °C, are measured by <b>differential</b> thermistor <b>thermometer.</b> By applying ultrasonic waves they refer to the changes of water content which cause the intensity absorption coefficient of ultrasonic waves α and the coefficient of surface heat generation β to vary. When the value of water content is 13. 2 % the difference of temperature rise has the maximum value, below about 13 % they are approximately proportional to water contents and over about 20 % they grow smaller. 2. The value of α at the water content of 13. 2 % calculated from Eq. (5) and from experimental values obtained, both by measuring the difference of temperature rise (⊿θ) between two positions A and B, and by measuring that between the position A and the third position, is 0. 064 - 0. 055. Over 13. 2 % ⊿θ will be {{more concerned with the}} variation of β than that of α. The porosity in the medium causes α to increase conspicuously. 3. As the temperature rise in the case of direct heating is higher than that in ultrasonics, it can be measured with the simpler circuit of thermistors. The changes of temperature rise depend mainly upon k/pC of the medium. At the water content of 5. 5 % it has the maximum value, and in the range from about 7 % to 17 %, it is approximately proportional to the water content, but the lower is the water content, the larger becomes the effect of heat radiation. After all, these results suggest the possibility that, even if there might be many limits and difficulties in application, these both methods will be able to to be used for measuring water contents when the chemical properties of water contained in the medium change...|$|R
50|$|In 1887 Wilhelm Ostwald {{moved to}} Leipzig, and {{physical}} chemistry {{then became a}} focus of Beckmann's work, as he served {{as an assistant to}} Ostwald. Beckmann used the methods of ebullioscopy (boiling-point elevation) and cryoscopy (freezing-point depression) to determine the molecular masses of several substances. These measurements required a careful determination of temperature differences, as opposed to absolute values, and to accomplish them Beckmann invented the <b>differential</b> <b>thermometer</b> that now carries his name (Beckmann thermometer). For this work he altered the methods of François-Marie Raoult, and the improvement was sufficiently great that Beckmann's method, and the associated equipment, became standard in chemical laboratories. However, {{by the end of the}} twentieth century these colligative-property techniques had been largely superseded by molecular mass determinations using electronic instrumentation.|$|E
40|$|The {{merits of}} Frequency Domain {{analysis}} {{as a tool}} for thermal system characterization are discussed, and the complex thermal impedance approach is illustrated. Pure AC thermal flux generation with negligible DC component is possible with a Peltier device, differently from other existing methods in which a significant DC component is intrinsically attached to the generated AC flux. Such technique is named here Peltier Driven Frequency Domain (PDFD). As a necessary prerequisite, a novel one-dimensional analytical model for an asymmetrically loaded Peltier device is developed, which is general enough to be useful in most practical situations as a design tool for measurement systems and as a key for the interpretation of experimental results. Impedance analysis is possible with Peltier devices by the inbuilt Seebeck effect <b>differential</b> <b>thermometer,</b> and is used in the paper for an experimental validation of the analytical model. Suggestions are then given for possible applications of PDFD, including the determination of thermal properties of material...|$|E
30|$|At {{the core}} of the pASC, {{as can be seen in}} the {{schematic}} depiction in Fig.  2, there is a sample platform equipped with an electrical heater and a thermistor (NTC resistance thermometer). This sample platform accommodates an sample cell, which is airtight to allow for operation under vacuum. The platform itself is mounted on top of a Peltier element, which acts as a <b>differential</b> <b>thermometer</b> for the temperature difference between the sample and the surrounding adiabatic shield. If this difference is maintained at zero, then all heat provided by the heater goes only to the sample (and its addenda), and hence the power required for Eqs. (1) and (5) is exactly known. This is achieved by feeding the Peltier output into a PID control system for the adiabatic shield, resulting in a temperature stability better than 50 K. This performance can only be attained because the adiabatic shield is itself surrounded by an additional thermal shield and a heat bath, each maintained at a slightly lower temperature; the details of these additional elements depend on the specific model of pASC.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{approach}} to calibrate {{the sensitivity of}} a <b>differential</b> <b>thermometer,</b> consisting of several thermocouples connected in series (thermopile), has been developed. The goal of this method {{is to increase the}} accuracy of small temperature difference measurements (Δ T ≤ 1 K), without invoking higher sensor complexity. To this end, a method to determine the optimal temperature difference employed during the differential measurement of thermoelectric sensitivities has been developed. This calibration temperature difference is found at the minimum of combined measurement and linearization error for a given mean temperature. The developed procedure is demonstrated in an illustrative example calibration of a nine-junction thermopile. For mean temperatures between - 10 ^oC and 15 ^oC, the thermoelectric sensitivity was measured with an uncertainty of less than ± 2 %. Subsequently, temperature differences as low as 10 ^- 2 K can be resolved, while the thermometer used for the example calibration was accurate only to ± 0. 3 K. This and higher degrees of accuracy are required in certain research applications, for example to detect heat flux modulations in bifurcating fluidic systems. Comment: 16 pages, 8 figure...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The thesis is mainly concerned with experimental studies of the heating effects of eddy currents. Sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal eddy current heating losses in non-magnetic conducting discs and spheres, subjected to a uniform field, are studied both theoretically and experimentally. The theory uses two different methods to calculate the power dissipation in the objects, and it employs Fourler series for the non-sinusoidal case. Some approximations for the losses at low frequency have been derived. The experimental study has three main sections. The first deals with the generation of uniform field for inducing eddy currents. Square Helmholtz coils have been designed, constructed and calibrated for this purpose. The second part {{is concerned with the}} measurement of the heat generated by eddy currents. A <b>differential</b> <b>thermometer,</b> using two matched therrnistors in a Blumlein bridge circuit, has been designed, built and calibrated. Operating close to balance, with a phase sensitive detector, the thermometer detects differences of 10 - 5 degrees C. In the third part, the experiment arranged for the eddy current heating measurements is described. The measured and the calculated results are compared, and the agreement was found to be about 2...|$|E
