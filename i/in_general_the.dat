5|$|A {{large part}} of the {{watershed}} of Darby Creek is on developed land, and many suburbs of Philadelphia are in the watershed. The majority (61%) of the land use is considered residential, while 11% is undeveloped and 10% is open space. Of the remaining land, most of it is considered industrial, commercial, and institutional, with 2.45% classified as paved. Estimates for the population of the watershed range from 484,000 to 500,000. <b>In</b> <b>general,</b> <b>the</b> topography of the watershed consists of rolling land that is densely settled.

5|$|Anabolism is {{the set of}} {{constructive}} metabolic processes {{where the}} energy released by catabolism is used to synthesize complex molecules. <b>In</b> <b>general,</b> <b>the</b> complex molecules that make up cellular structures are constructed step-by-step from small and simple precursors. Anabolism involves three basic stages. First, the production of precursors such as amino acids, monosaccharides, isoprenoids and nucleotides, secondly, their activation into reactive forms using energy from ATP, and thirdly, the assembly of these precursors into complex molecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, lipids and nucleic acids.|$|E
5|$|Another blow to Soviet {{communism}} in the First World {{came with the}} establishment of eurocommunism. Eurocommunists espoused and supported the ideals of Soviet communism {{while at the same time}} supporting rights of the individual. The largest obstacle was that it was the largest communist parties, those with highest electoral turnout, which became eurocommunists. Originating with the Prague Spring, this new thinking made the First World more skeptical of Soviet communism <b>in</b> <b>general.</b> <b>The</b> Italian Communist Party notably declared that should war break out in Europe, they would rally to the defense of Italy and resist any Soviet incursion on their nation's soil.|$|E

5|$|Bitter, {{confused}} fighting continued {{behind the}} 35th Infantry's {{line for the}} next week. Battalions, companies, and platoons, cut off and isolated, fought independently of higher control and help except for airdrops which supplied many of them. Airdrops also supplied relief forces {{trying to reach the}} front-line units. Tanks and armored cars drove to the isolated units with supplies of food and ammunition and carried back critically wounded on the return trips. <b>In</b> <b>general,</b> <b>the</b> 35th Infantry fought in its original battle line positions, while at first one battalion, and later two battalions, of the 27th Infantry fought toward it through the estimated 3,000 North Koreans operating in its rear areas.|$|E
5|$|By the 1970s and 1980s, the New York City Subway was at {{an all-time}} low.

Still, the NYCTA managed to open six new subway stations in the 1980s, make the current fleet of subway cars graffiti-free, as well as order 1,775 new subway cars. By the early 1990s, conditions had improved significantly, although maintenance backlogs accumulated during those 20 years are still being fixed today.|$|E

5|$|Calshot Castle {{was built}} as a {{consequence}} of international tensions between England, France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII. Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to local lords and communities, only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications, and while France and the Empire remained in conflict, maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely. Modest defences based around simple blockhouses and towers existed in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but <b>in</b> <b>general</b> <b>the</b> fortifications were limited in scale.|$|E
5|$|Cicadas are not major {{agricultural}} pests {{but in some}} outbreak years, trees may be overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of females laying their eggs in the shoots. Small trees may wilt and larger trees may lose small branches. Although <b>in</b> <b>general,</b> <b>the</b> feeding activities of the nymphs do little damage, during the year before an outbreak of periodic cicadas, the large nymphs feed heavily and plant growth may suffer. Some species have turned from wild grasses to sugar cane, and this has affected the crop adversely, {{and in a few}} isolated cases, females have oviposited on food crops such as date palms, grape vines, citrus trees, asparagus and cotton.|$|E
