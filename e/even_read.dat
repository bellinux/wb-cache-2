5|$|Aykroyd {{had never}} written a {{screenplay}} before, as he admitted in the 1998 documentary, Stories Behind the Making of The Blues Brothers, or <b>even</b> <b>read</b> one, {{and he was}} unable to find a writing partner. Consequently, he put together a very descriptive volume that explained the characters' origins and how the band members were recruited. His final draft was 324 pages, which was three times longer than a standard screenplay, written not in a standard screenplay format, but more like free verse. To soften the impact, Aykroyd made a joke of the thick script and had it bound with the cover of the Los Angeles Yellow Pages directory for when he turned it in to producer Robert K. Weiss. Landis was given the task of editing the script into a usable screenplay, which took him about two weeks.|$|E
25|$|On November 3, 1847, Regine {{married her}} old tutor, Johan Frederik Schlegel, in the Church of Our Saviour in Copenhagen. The {{marriage}} was happy and stable. Regine and Frederik <b>even</b> <b>read</b> aloud {{to each other}} passages from Kierkegaard's writings, which were then getting much attention in Denmark.|$|E

25|$|Ashurbanipal {{was proud}} of his scribal education. He asserts this in the statement: “I Assurbanipal within , took care of the wisdom of Nebo, the whole of the inscribed tablets, of all the clay tablets, the whole of their mysteries and difficulties, I solved.”. He {{was one of the few}} kings who could read the {{cuneiform}} script in Akkadian and Sumerian, and claimed that he <b>even</b> <b>read</b> texts from before the great flood. He was also able to solve mathematical problems. During his reign, he collected cuneiform texts from all over Mesopotamia, especially Babylonia, in the library of Nineveh.|$|E
25|$|The Sasanian kings were enlightened {{patrons of}} letters and philosophy. Khosrau I had the works of Plato and Aristotle {{translated}} into Pahlavi taught at Gundishapur, and <b>even</b> <b>read</b> them himself. During his reign, many historical annals were compiled, of which the sole survivor is the Karnamak-i Artaxshir-i Papakan (Deeds of Ardashir), a mixture of history and romance {{that served as the}} basis of the Iranian national epic, the Shahnameh. When Justinian I closed the schools of Athens, seven of their professors fled to Persia and found refuge at Khosrau's court. In time they grew homesick, and in his treaty of 533 with Justinian, the Sasanian king stipulated that the Greek sages should be allowed to return and be free from persecution.|$|E

25|$|Rather than preaching on the {{appointed}} gospel, {{as was the}} common practice at the time Zwingli preached through consecutive books of the Bible, a practice known as lectio continua which he learned from reading the sermons of John Chrysostom. John Oecolampadius preached from the Hebrew text rather than the Latin, though most theologians during the time often could not <b>even</b> <b>read</b> Greek. In Strasbourg, Martin Bucer and its other preachers also preached lectio continua. There, catechetical preaching took place every Sunday afternoon, so that the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, the Ten Commandments, and the sacraments were explained every year. This practice was also instituted in Wittenburg, Zurich, Basel, and Constance. Calvin preferred to conduct the entire service from the pulpit, and pulpits became prominent features in Reformed churches.|$|E

During this backlash, called the [...] "Simplification," [...] anyone of learning, and eventually anyone who could <b>even</b> <b>read,</b> was likely to be killed by rampaging mobs, who proudly took on the name of [...] "Simpletons."

500|$|Band {{members have}} {{resisted}} attempts {{to link the}} group and its music to Marxism. In a 1999 interview, Gane stated that [...] "none of us are Marxists... I've never <b>even</b> <b>read</b> Marx." [...] Gane said that although his partner's lyrics touch on political topics, they do not cross the line into [...] "sloganeering". Sadier had also said that she read very little Marx. In contrast, Cornelius Castoriadis, a radical political philosopher but strong critic of Marxism, has been cited as a marking influence in Sadier's thinking. Her side project's name (Monade) and its first album's title (Socialisme ou Barbarie) are also references {{to the work of}} Castoriadis.|$|E
500|$|There is {{a popular}} {{misconception}} that Prescott was completely blind, {{which seems to have}} stemmed from a misunderstanding of his comment in the preface to The Conquest of Mexico, in which he stated, [...] "Nor have I ever corrected, or <b>even</b> <b>read,</b> my own original draft". The myth was further propagated by a contemporary New York review of the Conquest, and has been a common theme in popular accounts of his work. Other related embellishments of Prescott's disability have also occurred—Samuel Eliot Morison, writing in a 1959 article for The Atlantic Monthly, claimed that Prescott had an artificial eye, although {{there is no evidence to}} suggest this. It has been argued that Prescott's biographers have naturally been drawn to romanticize his life due to Prescott's own romantic style of history.|$|E

500|$|Dieter Laser as Dr Josef Heiter, {{a retired}} surgeon who {{specialised}} in {{the separation of}} conjoined twins, but in retirement {{is more interested in}} joining creatures together. Casting for the role of Heiter took place in Berlin, and Six intended to cast Laser before he had <b>even</b> <b>read</b> for the part, after Six saw a DVD of one of Laser's previous films. Laser had previously appeared in over 60 mostly German-language films, including Der Unhold and Baltic Storm. Upon meeting him in Berlin, Six gave Laser a shot-by-shot explanation of Heiter's scenes, and Laser, impressed by Six's dedication and passion, agreed {{to take part in the}} film. Laser contributed considerably to the development of Heiter's character. For example, because Heiter views the [...] "centipede" [...] as his pet, Laser felt that it was important that Heiter appeared naked during a scene in which he swam in full view of his victims, because Laser said [...] "you aren't ashamed to be naked" [...] around a pet.|$|E
500|$|George Bernard Shaw {{believed}} that Fielding was [...] "the greatest practising dramatist, {{with the single}} exception of Shakespeare, produced in England between the Middle Ages and the nineteenth century." [...] However, modern critics rarely agree with Shaw, as Robert Hume points out, [...] "Few scholars have been much interested in Fielding's highly successful career as a dramatist. To most it has seemed a false start. Readers tend to find the conventional plays derivative and sentimental, the topical ones scrappy and superficial." [...] In particular, only one book until 1988 was published on the topic, which was Ducrocq's Le theatre de Fielding, 1728–1737, et ses prolongements dans l'oeuvre romanesque. This critical approach {{is not limited to}} just Fielding, but to the whole field; the reputation of Colley Cibber was ruined by Pope's characterising him as the Arch Dunce and [...] "Since the plays of Cibber's only serious rival, Henry Fielding, are hardly <b>even</b> <b>read</b> these days, let alone performed, the earlier eighteenth-century theater tends to be passed over with (at best) a polite cough." ...|$|E

She didn't <b>even</b> <b>read</b> or write it!" [...] Reinecke forwarded the letter to Nixon aide John Ehrlichman with the comment, [...] "I suspect that Carla's reaction may be shared by other young people who worked in the Nixon campaign". Nixon assistant Charles E. Stuart replied to Reinecke, stating, [...] "Vicki Lynne has been invited to the inauguration not because she carried the sign, or even because she made the sign, but rather because the sign which she did carry proved to be an inspiration to Mr. Nixon" [...] and expressed his confidence the invitation would be well received by other young Nixon partisans.|$|E

Giuliani <b>even</b> <b>read</b> the lyrics to the song in a live press conference. Joel replied in a statement, [...] "There are a lot of important issues facing the voters in this Senate race.
