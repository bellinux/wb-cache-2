5|$|The {{emergency}} services announced a major emergency at 06:08 and a fire fighting effort began. The {{cause of the}} explosion was a <b>fuel-air</b> explosion in a vapour cloud of evaporated leaking fuel. The British Geological Survey monitored the event, which measured 2.4 on the Richter scale.|$|E
5|$|The second {{scenario}} {{revolved around}} the discovery of an ancient mausoleum by archaeologists. An ancient virus contained in the mausoleum has quickly killed all the archaeological team, but prior to their death they radioed that a very important and undocumented tapestry is hanging inside. The local government is planning to cleanse the area with a <b>fuel-air</b> explosion in 15 minutes, so the scientists will send in an autonomous aerial robot to find the mausoleum, enter it (or send in a sensor probe/subvehicle) and relay pictures of the tapestry back prior {{to the destruction of}} the mausoleum and its contents.|$|E
5|$|The Wrights {{wrote to}} several engine manufacturers, but none met {{their need for}} a {{sufficiently}} lightweight powerplant. They turned to their shop mechanic, Charlie Taylor, who built an engine in just six weeks in close consultation with the brothers. To keep the weight low enough, the engine block was cast from aluminum, a rare practice for the time. The Wright/Taylor engine had a primitive version of a carburetor, and had no fuel pump. Gasoline was gravity-fed from the fuel tank mounted on a wing strut into a chamber next to the cylinders where it was mixed with air: the <b>fuel-air</b> mixture was then vaporized by heat from the crankcase, forcing it into the cylinders.|$|E
25|$|In {{combustion}} engineering, <b>fuel–air</b> equivalence ratio. The ratio {{between the}} actual fuel air ratio to the stoichiometric fuel air ratio.|$|E
25|$|The {{vaporizing}} fuel injector, {{the third}} type, {{is similar to}} the air blast injector in that primary air is mixed with the fuel as it is injected into the combustion zone. However, the <b>fuel-air</b> mixture travels through a tube within the combustion zone. Heat from the combustion zone is transferred to the <b>fuel-air</b> mixture, vaporizing some of the fuel (mixing it better) before it is combusted. This method allows the fuel to be combusted with less thermal radiation, which helps protect the liner. However, the vaporizer tube may have serious durability problems with low fuel flow within it (the fuel inside of the tube protects the tube from the combustion heat).|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{determine}} what ignited the flammable <b>fuel-air</b> vapor in the CWT and caused the explosion, the NTSB evaluated numerous potential ignition sources. All but one were considered very unlikely {{to have been the}} source of ignition.|$|E
25|$|The {{explosive}} mechanism was a gas-enhanced device {{consisting of}} compressed butane in canisters employed with pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) {{to create a}} <b>fuel-air</b> explosive. The bomb was carried on a layer of concrete covered with a slab of marble to direct the blast upward. Despite the lack of sophistication and wide availability of its component parts, a gas-enhanced device can be a lethal weapon. These devices were similar to <b>fuel-air</b> or thermobaric weapons, explaining the large blast and damage. An after-action forensic investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) determined that the bomb was so powerful that {{it probably would have}} brought down the building even if the sentries had managed to stop the truck between the gate and the building.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{considered}} {{several possible}} causes for the structural breakup: structural failure and decompression, detonation of a high-energy explosive device, {{such as a}} missile warhead exploding either upon impact with the airplane, or just before impact, a bomb exploding inside the airplane, or a <b>fuel-air</b> explosion in the center wing fuel tank.|$|E
25|$|Compression {{ignition}} Diesel engines {{ignite the}} <b>fuel-air</b> mixture {{by the heat}} of compression and do not need a spark. They usually have glowplugs that preheat the combustion chamber to allow starting in cold weather. Other engines may use a flame, or a heated tube, for ignition. While this was common for very early engines it is now rare.|$|E
25|$|An {{ignition}} system generates a spark or heats an electrode {{to a high}} temperature to ignite a <b>fuel-air</b> mixture in spark ignition internal combustion engines oil-fired and gas-fired boilers, rocket engines, etc. The widest application for spark ignition internal combustion engines is in petrol (gasoline) road vehicles: cars (autos), four-by-fours (SUVs), motorcycles, pickups, vans, trucks, and buses.|$|E
25|$|In a Wankel engine, the <b>fuel-air</b> mixture {{cannot be}} pre-stored {{because there are}} {{consecutive}} intake cycles. The engine has a 50% longer stroke duration than a reciprocating piston engine. The four Otto cycles last 1080° for a Wankel engine (three revolutions of the output shaft) versus 720° for a four-stroke reciprocating engine, but the four strokes are still the same proportion of the total.|$|E
25|$|The premixing/prevaporizing {{injectors}} work {{by mixing}} or vaporizing the fuel {{before it reaches}} the combustion zone. This method allows the fuel to be very uniformly mixed with the air, reducing emissions from the engine. One disadvantage of this method is that fuel may auto-ignite or otherwise combust before the <b>fuel-air</b> mixture reaches the combustion zone. If this happens the combustor can be seriously damaged.|$|E
25|$|Bad fuel economy. This {{is due to}} seal leakages, and {{the shape}} of the {{combustion}} chamber, which results in poor combustion behavior and mean effective pressure at part load, low rpm. Meeting the emissions regulations requirements sometimes mandates a <b>fuel-air</b> ratio that is not conducive to good fuel economy. Acceleration and deceleration in average driving conditions also affect fuel economy. However, operating the engine at a constant speed and load eliminates excess fuel consumption.|$|E
25|$|The {{gasoline}} is fed either from a pressurised tank (whose pressure can be hand-pumped or fed from a gas cylinder). OR from a non pressurised tank with the fuel being {{drawn into the}} torch by venturi action by the pressurised oxygen flow. Another low cost approach commonly used by jewelry makers in Asia is using air bubbled through a gasoline container by a foot-operated air pump, and burning the <b>fuel-air</b> mixture in a specialized welding torch.|$|E
25|$|The Russians {{proceeded}} to bombard Grozny with artillery, tank, and rocket fire {{as the rest}} of the battle centered on new tactics in which the Russians {{proceeded to}} destroy the city block by block. White phosphorus rounds and <b>fuel-air</b> explosive Shmel rockets were used by the Russian forces. They would then send in small groups of men sometimes spearheaded by special forces, making effective use of sniper teams. Two long weeks of costly bitter fighting ensued as the Russians moved to take the Presidential Palace.|$|E
25|$|In the past, grain {{elevators}} sometimes experienced silo explosions. Fine powder {{from the}} millions of grains passing through the facility would accumulate and mix with the oxygen in the air. A spark could spread from one floating particle to the other creating a chain reaction that would destroy the entire structure. (This dispersed-fuel explosion is the mechanism behind <b>fuel-air</b> bombs.) To prevent this, elevators have very rigorous rules against smoking or any other open flame. Many elevators also have various devices installed to maximize ventilation, safeguards against overheating in belt conveyors, legs, bearing, and explosion-proof electrical devices such as electric motors, switches, and lighting.|$|E
25|$|The inverse is {{also true}} when the {{aircraft}} is in inverted flight. The float becomes submerged as the fuel is pulled downward by gravity {{to the top of}} the fuel bowl. The float lifts upward toward the bottom of the inverted fuel bowl. With the float at the bottom of the fuel bowl, the fuel inlet valve opens, as it would when there is not enough fuel in the fuel bowl. With the fuel inlet valve open, the fuel pump continues pumping fuel into the fuel bowl, where the resulting excess fuel causes the <b>fuel-air</b> ratio to become lower than nine to one, which is then too rich for combustion to take place, stopping the engine.|$|E
500|$|From all accounts, {{it seems}} to have been an {{unconfined}} vapour cloud explosion of unusually high strengthalso known as a <b>fuel-air</b> explosion. Because of an inversion layer, the explosions were heard up to [...] away; there were reports that they were audible in Belgium, France, and the Netherlands.|$|E
500|$|The {{deployment}} of Gravel mines and the Wide-Area Anti-Personnel Mine System became integral {{parts of the}} operation. Other weapons were specifically developed or otherwise became associated with the campaign as well. These notably included the BLU-31/B and Mk 36 air-dropped mines, BLU-43/B and BLU-44/B landmine system (Dragontooth), the BLU-72/B <b>fuel-air</b> explosive (Pave Pat), and the BLU-52/A chemical bomb (filled with bulk CS-2 powder). [...] Anti-vehicle operations in support of Muscle Shoals/Igloo White were designated Mud River, while anti-personnel operations received the codename Dump Truck.|$|E
500|$|GE started {{developing}} and testing {{a new type}} of combustor called the Twin Annular Premixing Swirler combustor, or [...] "TAPS", during the Tech56 program. This design is similar to the double-annular combustor in that it has two combustion zones; this combustor [...] "swirls" [...] the flow, creating an ideal <b>fuel–air</b> mixture. This difference allows the combustor to generate much less NOx than other combustors. Tests on a CFM56-7B engine demonstrated an improvement of 46% over single-annular combustors and 22% over double-annular combustors. The analytical tools developed for TAPS have also been used to improve other combustors, notably the single-annular combustors in some CFM56-5B and -7B engines.|$|E
500|$|The {{different}} vendors all collaborated for {{the final}} battle sequence, which {{takes place in the}} wreckage of a helicarrier: Luma created the climactic fight between Deadpool and Ajax; DD created the majority of the Colossus effects, except for when he is damaged later on, which was handled by Blur Studio; DD also created the effects for Negasonic Teenage Warhead's abilities as well as expanding the helicarrier's deck; Rodeo contributed matte paintings for the background; and Weta provided the facial animation for Deadpool. Negasonic's abilities were the only [...] "supernatural effect-sy thing" [...] in the film, and were based on <b>fuel-air</b> exposives and solar flares to try ground them in reality. Setting the final sequence on the wrecked helicarrier was Miller's idea, to help expand the scope of the third act and include more connections to the comics and wider Marvel Universe. To avoid rights issues with Marvel Studios, the helicarrier for Deadpool was designed to be [...] "as different as possible from the one in The Avengers." [...] Additionally, a French animation artist with a [...] "unique style" [...] created 2D cartoon characters that dance around Deadpool after he is stabbed in the head during the fight.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} torpedo plane attacks, American carrier dive bombers arrived over the Japanese {{carriers}} almost undetected and began their dives. At 10:22, 25 SBD Dauntless dive-bombers from Enterprise, led by C. Wade McClusky, hit Kaga with one [...] bomb {{and at least}} three [...] bombs. The first landed near her rear elevator and set the berthing compartments on fire, and the next bomb hit the forward elevator and penetrated the upper hangar, setting off explosions and fires among the armed and fueled planes on her hangar deck. Captain Okada {{and most of the}} ship's senior officers were killed by the third bomb, which hit the bridge. The 1000-pound bomb hit amidships and penetrated the flight deck to explode on the upper hangar. The explosions ruptured the ship's avgas lines, damaged both her port and starboard fire mains and the emergency generator powering her fire pumps, as well as knocking out the carbon dioxide fire suppression system. Fueled by the avgas pouring onto the hangar deck, the fires detonated the [...] of bombs and torpedoes strewn across the hangar deck in a series of catastrophic multiple <b>fuel-air</b> explosions that blew out the hangar sides. At nearly the same time, dive bombers hit and fatally damaged Akagi and Sōryū.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} evening of 11 September 2007 the <b>fuel-air</b> {{explosive}} AVBPM or [...] "Father of all bombs" [...] was successfully field-tested. According to the Russian military, the new weapon will replace several smaller types of nuclear bombs in its arsenal.|$|E
2500|$|Excess {{engine oil}} from the {{flywheel}} overflowed the reservoir and trickled over the large surface area of the round flywheel cover. [...] Two passages cast into the cover took air-fuel mixture from the carburettor mounted at the bottom to a copper U-shaped inlet manifold mounted between the banks of cylinders, and the flywheel cover acted as a heat exchanger, preheating the <b>fuel-air.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Some defense analysts {{question}} {{both the}} yield {{of the bomb}} and whether it could be deployed by a Tupolev Tu-160 bomber. A report by Wired says photos and the video of the event {{suggest that it is}} designed to be deployed from the rear of a slow moving cargo plane, and they note that the bomb-test video released by the Russians never shows both the bomb and the bomber in the same camera shot. There are also questions on what type of explosives it used. They quoted Tom Burky, a senior research scientist at Battelle, saying [...] "It's not even clear what kind of weapon the Russians tested." [...] He questions if it was what some experts call a <b>fuel-air</b> explosive or if it was a thermobaric weapon. [...] "Fuel-air and thermobaric bombs differ in usefulness". Burky says that the weapon depicted in the video appears to be a <b>fuel-air</b> explosive, based on its shape.|$|E
2500|$|The 1968 model saw {{the effects}} of burgeoning U.S. safety and {{emissions}} legislation. [...] For example, from a safety perspective, dual system (aka tandem) brakes were introduced along with a brake failure warning device. [...] The engine's state of tune was attenuated with a milder camshaft and a distributor with idle speed ignition timing retarded to address emissions. [...] The twin SU carburettors now included overrun valves in the throttle discs and anti-tampering features on carburettor <b>fuel-air</b> mixture nuts.|$|E
2500|$|At {{temperatures}} {{as low as}} , <b>fuel-air</b> mixtures {{can react}} chemically and produce very weak flames called cool flames. The phenomenon was discovered by Humphry Davy in 1817. The process depends on a fine balance of temperature and concentration of the reacting mixture, and if conditions are right it can initiate without any external ignition source. Cyclical variations {{in the balance of}} chemicals, particularly of intermediate products in the reaction, give oscillations in the flame, with a typical temperature variation of about , or between [...] "cool" [...] and full ignition. Sometimes the variation can lead to an explosion.|$|E
2500|$|Float type carburetors {{are able}} to {{compensate}} for these unstable conditions through various design features, but only within reason. For example, once the float type carburetor is under negative g conditions, such as a rapid nose down attitude, the float lifts {{toward the top of}} the fuel bowl as the float becomes weightless when the aircraft descends faster than the float and the fuel. The float is [...] lifted upward by inertia, closing the fuel inlet valve as if the fuel bowl was full of fuel. Cutting off the fuel supply causes the <b>fuel-air</b> ratio to become greater than sixteen to one, which is then too lean for combustion to take place, stopping the engine.|$|E
2500|$|Standards for the {{blending}} of ethanol and methanol in gasoline exist in many countries, including the EU, the US and Brazil. Approximate equivalent butanol blends {{can be calculated}} from {{the relations between the}} stoichiometric <b>fuel-air</b> ratio of butanol, ethanol and gasoline. Common ethanol fuel mixtures for fuel sold as gasoline currently range from 5% to 10%. The share of butanol can be 60% greater than the equivalent ethanol share, which gives a range from 8% to 16%. [...] "Equivalent" [...] in this case refers only to the vehicle's ability to adjust to the fuel. Other properties such as energy density, viscosity and heat of vaporization will vary and may further limit the percentage of butanol that can be blended with gasoline.|$|E
2500|$|Production {{started in}} 1992 with the 1900lbf (8.45kN) thrust FJ44-1A, which {{comprises}} a 20.9 in (531mm) diameter single stage blisk fan plus a single intermediate pressure (IP) booster stage, {{driven by a}} 2 stage low pressure (LP) turbine, supercharging a single stage centrifugal high pressure (HP) compressor, driven by a single stage uncooled high pressure (HP) turbine. The combustor is an impingement cooled annular design. [...] Fuel is delivered to the combustor through an unusual rotating fuel nozzle system, rather than the standard <b>fuel-air</b> mixers or vapourisers. The bypass duct runs the full length the engine. Specific fuel consumption at 1900lbf (8.45kN) thrust at SLS, ISA is understood to be 0.456lb/(hr lbf). A derated version, the 1500lbf (6.67kN) thrust FJ44-1C has an SFC of 0.460lb/(hr lbf).|$|E
2500|$|Yousef was {{assisted}} by Iraqi bomb maker Abdul Rahman Yasin, who helped assemble the complex [...] bomb, {{which was made}} of a urea nitrate main charge with aluminum, magnesium and ferric oxide particles surrounding the explosive. The charge used nitroglycerine, ammonium nitrate dynamite, smokeless powder and fuse as booster explosives. Three tanks of bottled hydrogen were also placed in a circular configuration around the main charge, to enhance the fireball and afterburn of the solid metal particles. The use of compressed gas cylinders {{in this type of}} attack closely resembles the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing 10 years earlier. Both of these attacks used compressed gas cylinders to create <b>fuel-air</b> and thermobaric bombs that release more energy than conventional high explosives. According to testimony in the bomb trial, only once before the 1993 attack had the FBI recorded a bomb that used urea nitrate.|$|E
2500|$|The Voitenko {{compressor}} initially separates a {{test gas}} from a shaped charge with a malleable steel plate. When the shaped charge detonates, {{most of its}} energy {{is focused on the}} steel plate, driving it forward and pushing the test gas ahead of it. Ames Research Center translated this idea into a self-destroying shock tube. A [...] shaped charge accelerated the gas in a 3-cm glass-walled tube 2 meters in length. The velocity of the resulting shock wave was a phenomenal [...] The apparatus exposed to the detonation was, of course, completely destroyed, but not before useful data were extracted. In a typical Voitenko compressor, a shaped charge accelerates hydrogen gas, which in turn accelerates a thin disk up to about 40km/s. A slight modification to the Voitenko compressor concept is a super-compressed detonation, a device that uses a compressible liquid or solid fuel in the steel compression chamber instead of a traditional gas mixture. A further extension of this technology is the explosive diamond anvil cell, utilizing multiple opposed shaped-charge jets projected at a single steel-encapsulated fuel, such as hydrogen. The fuels used in these devices, along with the secondary combustion reactions and long blast impulse, produce similar conditions to those encountered in <b>fuel-air</b> and thermobaric explosives.|$|E
2500|$|Introduced in 2009 as a 2010 {{model year}} vehicle, the RX 450h (GLV10/GLV15) premiered {{alongside}} its non-hybrid counterpart, the RX 350. Manufacturer's specifications indicated largely identical outward dimensions for the RX 450h with the RX 350. The RX 450h {{was scheduled to}} go on sale in the U.S. in mid to late 2009, with sales introductions for the RX 450h in Asia (including Japan) and Europe in the same year. The RX 450h features an upgraded 3.5L 2GR-FXE V6 engine (shared with the RX 350) which produces [...] at 6000 rpm, along with a new inverter which boosts total horsepower to [...] (with the electric motors providing an added [...] ). The new inverter is 8kg lighter, and more efficient. Up to three electric motors {{are used in the}} hybrid system, including two dual motors for the forward wheels (123kW output), and a third for the rear wheels on the AWD model (50kW; engages when slippage is detected or the throttle pressed firmly). The RX 450h's V6 engine now runs on the Atkinson cycle for added efficiency. Compared to the prior Otto cycle system, the Atkinson cycle has a lower compression ratio, along with higher expansion ratio inside engine cylinders. This system uses less energy to form <b>fuel-air</b> mixtures, and releases more energy. A lighter, more free-flowing oil (0W-20) is also used, reducing friction energy loss and oil pump power requirements. Two additional systems are added to the RX 450h's Lexus Hybrid Drive powertrain, an exhaust heat recovery system to reduce engine warm-up periods (optimizing engine start-stop times, particularly in cold conditions), and a cooled exhaust gas-recirculation system to reduce fuel pumping loss. The electric motors use the first automotive application of liquid cooling {{on both sides of the}} high-current transistors, allowing greater contribution from the electric motors versus the gasoline engine.|$|E
5000|$|By the {{combustion}} of a gaseous <b>fuel-air</b> mixture; this is generally called a combustion launcher, and its pressure is limited {{primarily by the}} energy density of the <b>fuel-air</b> mixture (less than [...] with all safe fuels).|$|E
50|$|In the Miller-cycle engine, {{the piston}} begins to {{compress}} the <b>fuel-air</b> mixture {{only after the}} intake valve closes; and the intake valve closes after the piston has traveled a certain distance above its bottom-most position: around 20 to 30% of the total piston travel of this upward stroke. So in the Miller cycle engine, the piston actually compresses the <b>fuel-air</b> mixture only during the latter 70% to 80% of the compression stroke. During the initial part of the compression stroke, the piston pushes part of the <b>fuel-air</b> mixture through the still-open intake valve, {{and back into the}} intake manifold.|$|E
