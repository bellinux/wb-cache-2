5|$|The first Dnestr-M at Olenegorsk was {{completed}} by 1968. In 1970, the radars at Olenegorsk and Skrunda, and an associated command centre at Solnechnogorsk, were accepted for service. According to Podvig (2002), <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>they</b> were positioned to identify missile launches from NATO submarines in the Norwegian and North Seas.|$|E
5|$|Reich {{first met}} Sigmund Freud in 1919 {{when he asked}} Freud for a reading list for a seminar {{concerning}} sexology. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>they</b> left a strong impression on each other. Freud allowed him to start meeting with analytic patients in September that year, although Reich was just 22 years old and still an undergraduate, which gave him a small income. He was accepted as a guest member of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Association, becoming a regular member in October 1920, and began his own analysis with Isidor Sadger. He lived and worked out of an apartment on Berggasse 7, the street on which Freud lived at no. 19, in the Alsergrund area of Vienna.|$|E
5|$|The Path of the King {{picks up}} with Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and the Rohirrim {{on the way}} to Minas Tirith. Before arriving, however, the three companions must walk the Paths of the Dead in an effort to {{convince}} the Army of the Dead to join their cause in the War of the Ring. To do so, they must defeat the King of the Dead (Jarion Monroe) in combat. After this, the Paths of the Dead start to collapse, and they must escape before the falling rubble crushes them. With the Army of the Dead pledged to aid them, they travel to Minas Tirith and enter the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Joining the Rohirrim and the soldiers of Minas Tirith, they face orcs, Easterlings, Haradrim and oliphaunts. They must also defend Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Éowyn (Lorri Holt), allowing Éowyn the opportunity to defeat the Witch-king of Angmar. As <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>they</b> are about to be overwhelmed, the Army of Dead arrive, destroying the forces of Mordor and saving Minas Tirith.|$|E

5|$|The {{units of}} the field armies, {{including}} palatini, comitatenses, and sometimes pseudocomitatenses, were based in cities when not on campaign, and could be based in temporary camps when on campaign. But it seems that did not usually occupy purpose-built accommodation like the city-based limitanei. From the legal evidence, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>they</b> were normally compulsorily billeted in private houses (hospitalitas). This is because they often wintered in different provinces. The comitatus praesentales accompanied their respective emperors on campaign, while even the regional comitatus would change their winter quarters according to operational requirements. However, in the 5th century, emperors rarely campaigned in person, so the praesentales became more static in their winter bases. The Western comitatus praesentalis normally was based in and around Mediolanum (Milan) and the two Eastern comitatus {{in the vicinity of}} Constantinople.|$|E
25|$|Their {{metabolism}} {{has long}} been debated, but recent research shows {{that they are not}} saprotrophic. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>they</b> may be symbiotically associated with mosses, as suggested by several earlier authors.|$|E
25|$|Temnodontosaurus {{were the}} top predators in the Early Jurassic seas. Their diet was mainly {{vertebrate}} prey and <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>they</b> {{were the only}} Jurassic Ichthyosaurs {{to have such a}} diet.|$|E

60|$|The young fellows went on {{to speak}} of Mrs. Bowen, whom <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>they</b> had known the winter before. She had been very polite to them; they praised {{her as if she}} were quite an old woman.|$|R
5000|$|Brouillet was a pupil of Jean-Léon Gérôme who was, himself, also {{renowned for}} the fact that his illustrative paintings, such as Phryne before the Areopagus (1861), were so popular as lithographic prints that <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>they</b> were [...] "painted in order to be reproduced".|$|R
25|$|The {{presence}} of the Scythians in north-western India during the 1st century BCE was contemporary {{with that of the}} Indo-Greek Kingdoms there, and <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>they</b> initially recognized the power of the local Greek rulers.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} has been silently asked and silently answered, <b>it</b> <b>seems.</b> <b>They</b> are both afflicted and blessed, full of shared secrets, striving every moment. They are both impersonating someone. They are weary and beleaguered; they have taken on such enormous work.|$|E
25|$|During {{the morning}} of 17 August 2009, 50people were {{gathered}} around turbine2. As the plant general director, Nikolai Nevolko, was celebrating his anniversary, {{early in the morning}} he went to Abakan to greet the arriving guests, and none of the workers present wanted, or had the authority, to make decisions about further actions regarding the turbine. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>they</b> were used to the high levels of vibration.|$|E

25|$|In summer 1963, Evans and {{his girlfriend}} Ellaine left their flat in New York and settled in his parents' home in Florida, where, <b>it</b> <b>seems,</b> <b>they</b> quit the habit for some time. Even though never legally married, Bill and Ellaine were in all respects man and wife. At that time, Ellaine meant {{everything}} to Bill, and {{was the only person}} with whom he felt genuine comfort.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} Orc shaman led an army from Draenor into Azeroth, apparently {{hoping to}} steal magical artifacts {{with which to}} create further Portals. The Alliance, expecting an attack, sent through the Portal an army led by the Alliance's supreme commander, its greatest heroes and the mage who had destroyed the Azeroth Portal. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>they</b> destroyed the counterpart of the Azeroth Portal, {{but it was not}} known whether the force escaped from Draenor.|$|E
25|$|In 878, a third Viking army {{gathered}} on the Thames. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>they</b> were partly discouraged by the defeat of Guthrum but also Alfred's success against the Vikings coincided with a period of renewed weakness in Francia. The Frankish emperor, Charles the Bald, died in 877 and his son shortly after, precipitating a period of political instability of which the Vikings were quick to take advantage. The assembled Viking army on the Thames departed in 879 to begin new campaigns on the continent.|$|E
60|$|Both men turned seaward. Far {{away in the}} clouds, <b>it</b> <b>seemed,</b> <b>they</b> {{could hear}} a faint humming, some new sound, {{something}} mechanical in its regular beating, yet with clamorous throatiness of some human force cleaving {{its way through the}} resistless air. With every second it grew louder. The men stood clutching one another.|$|R
60|$|They did, and saw {{the hollow}} of the night, the bare, bright face of the sea, and the stars {{regarding}} them; and the voices died in their bosoms at the spectacle.

25|$|In 2013, the Spanish Air Force retired its {{fleet of}} Mirage F1s, having {{progressively}} phased the type {{out of service}} as increasing numbers of the Eurofighter Typhoon had become available. During 2013, {{it was reported that}} Spain may sell sixteen F1M's to Argentina but <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>they</b> now have the budget to buy new Kfirs instead. The deal went through and Argentina bought the Spanish Mirages in October 2013, but the deal was scrapped in March 2014 after pressure from the United Kingdom on Spain to not assist in FAA modernization over tensions between the countries over the Falkland Islands.|$|E
25|$|Another anthropologist, Kristen Hawkes, has criticised both {{of these}} theories. On the one hand, {{opposing}} Harris, she says both that {{the quickest way to}} get more male warriors would have been to have more females as child-bearers and that having more females in a village would increase the potential for marriage alliances with other villages. Against the procreative imperative theory she points out that the corollary to well-off elites such as those in northern India wanting to maximise reproduction is that poor people would want to minimise it and thus in theory should have practiced male infanticide, which <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>they</b> did not.|$|E
500|$|... – Ordinary reading εις την πατριδα αυτου (to his own country) {{changed into}} εις την αντιπατριδα αυτου (to his own Antipatris), and in Acts 8:5 εις την πολιν της Σαμαρειας {{replaced}} into εις την πολιν της Καισαριας. These two variants {{do not exist}} in any other manuscript, and <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>they</b> were made by a scribe. According to T. C. Skeat they suggest Caesarea as a place in which the manuscript was made.|$|E

60|$|With beating hearts, they descended {{through the}} hawthorns.

Yet a little farther and they came forth before {{the ruins of the}} house.|$|R

2500|$|Sir William was a keen cricketer and patron who led {{and backed}} Sussex county cricket teams. One of his teams has been {{credited}} with the earliest known innings victory.
