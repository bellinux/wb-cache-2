Poaching has been controlled but water supply <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>continuing</b> effort. In 1979 the first of several water troughs supplied from water barrels transported by bullock cart and open wells were built.

25|$|Contemporary {{commentators}} have highlighted {{situations in which}} toleration conflicts with widely held moral standards, national law, the principles of national identity, or other strongly held goals. Michael Walzer notes that the British in India tolerated the Hindu practice of suttee (ritual burning of a widow) until 1829. On the other hand, the United States declined to tolerate the Mormon practice of polygamy. The French head scarf controversy represents a conflict between religious practice and the French secular ideal. Toleration of the Romani people in European countries <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>continuing</b> issue.|$|E

One trend is increased use of Machine vision to provide automatic inspection and robot guidance functions, another <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>continuing</b> increase in the use of robots.

25|$|Throughout {{the areas}} where {{trenches}} and fighting lines were located, such as the Champagne region of France, quantities of unexploded ordnance have remained, some of which remains dangerous, continuing to cause injuries and occasional fatalities in the 21st century. Some are found by farmers ploughing their fields and have been called the iron harvest. Some of this ammunition contains toxic chemical products such as mustard gas. Cleanup of major battlefields <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>continuing</b> task {{with no end in}} sight for decades to come. Squads remove, defuse or destroy hundreds of tons of unexploded ammunition every year in Belgium, France, and Germany.|$|E
25|$|The Voyager program <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>continuing</b> American {{scientific}} {{program that}} employs two robotic probes, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, {{to study the}} outer Solar System. They were launched in 1977 {{to take advantage of}} a favorable alignment of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, and are now exploring the outer boundary of the heliosphere in interstellar space. Although their original mission was to study only the planetary systems of Jupiter and Saturn, Voyager 2 continued on to Uranus and Neptune, and both Voyagers are now tasked with exploring interstellar space. Their mission has been extended three times, and both probes continue to collect and relay useful scientific data. Neither Uranus nor Neptune has been visited by any probe other than Voyager 2.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{her career}} as a writer and teacher, she has {{remained}} grounded in the history-filled landscape of the Laguna Pueblo. Her experiences in the culture have fueled an interest to preserve cultural traditions and understand the impact of the past on contemporary life. A well-known novelist and poet, Silko's career has been characterized by making people aware of ingrained racism and white cultural imperialism, and a commitment to support women's issues. Her novels have many characters who attempt what some perceive a simple yet uneasy return to balance Native American traditions survivalism with the violence of modern America. The clash of civilizations <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>continuing</b> theme in the modern Southwest and of the difficult search for balance that the region’s inhabitants encounter.|$|E

25|$|Single mother {{households}} are critical in addressing feminization {{of poverty and}} can be broadly defined as households {{in which there are}} female headships and no male headships. Single mother {{households are}} at the highest risk of poverty for women due to lack of Income and resources. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>continuing</b> increase of single mother households in the world, which results in higher percentages of women in poverty. Single mothers are the poorest women in society, and their children tend to be disadvantaged in comparison to their peers. Different factors can be taken into account for the {{rise in the number of}} female headship in households. When men become migrant workers, women are left to be the main caretaker of their homes. Other factors such as illnesses and deaths of husbands lead to an increase in single mother households in developing countries.|$|E
25|$|In {{criminal}} law, {{a conspiracy}} is {{an agreement between}} two or more persons {{to commit a crime}} at some time in the future. Criminal law in some countries or for some conspiracies may require that at least one overt act must also have been undertaken in furtherance of that agreement, to constitute an offense. There is no limit on the number participating in the conspiracy and, in most countries, no requirement that any steps have been taken to put the plan into effect (compare attempts which require proximity to the full offence). For the purposes of concurrence, the actus reus <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>continuing</b> one and parties may join the plot later and incur joint liability and conspiracy can be charged where the co-conspirators have been acquitted or cannot be traced. Finally, repentance by one or more parties does not affect liability – unless, in some cases, it occurs before the parties have committed overt acts – but may reduce their sentence.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the United Methodist Church, there are over 40 other denominations that descend from John Wesley's Methodist movement. Some, such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the AME Zion Church, the Free Methodist Church, the Wesleyan Church (formerly Wesleyan Methodist Connection), the Congregational Methodist Church and First Congregational Methodist Church are explicitly Methodist. The Primitive Methodist Church <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>continuing</b> branch of the former British Primitive Methodist Church. Others do not call themselves Methodist, but are related to varying degrees. The Evangelical Church was formed {{by a group of}} EUB congregations who dissented from the merger which formed the United Methodist Church. The United Methodist Church has also taken steps to strengthen ties with its fellow Methodist churches, as well as other Protestant denominations in the United States. Since 1985, the UMC has been exploring a possible merger with three historically African-American Methodist denominations: the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, and the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church. A Commission on Pan Methodist Cooperation and Union formed in 2000 to carry out work on such a merger.|$|E
