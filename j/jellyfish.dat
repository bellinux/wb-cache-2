5|$|All the Kimberella fossils {{found so}} far are {{assigned}} to one species, K. quadrata. The first specimens were discovered in Australia in 1959. They were originally classified as <b>jellyfish</b> by Martin Glaessner and Mary Wade in 1966, and then as box <b>jellyfish</b> by Wade in 1972, a view that remained popular until the fossils of the White sea region were discovered; these prompted a reinterpretation. Research on these specimens by Mikhail A. Fedonkin, initially with Benjamin M. Waggoner in 1997, led to Kimberella being recognised as the oldest well-documented triploblastic bilaterian organism — not a <b>jellyfish</b> at all.|$|E

5|$|<b>Jellyfish</b> stings killed about 1,500 {{people in}} the 20th century, and cubozoans are {{particularly}} dangerous. On the other hand, some large <b>jellyfish</b> are considered a delicacy in East and Southeast Asia. Coral reefs have long been economically important as providers of fishing grounds, protectors of shore buildings against currents and tides, and more recently as centers of tourism. However, they are vulnerable to over-fishing, mining for construction materials, pollution, and damage caused by tourism.|$|E
5|$|Prey of cnidarians {{ranges from}} {{plankton}} to animals several {{times larger than}} themselves. Some cnidarians are parasites, mainly on <b>jellyfish</b> but a few are major pests of fish. Others obtain most of their nourishment from endosymbiotic algae or dissolved nutrients. Predators of cnidarians include: sea slugs, which can incorporate nematocysts into their own bodies for self-defense; starfish, notably the crown of thorns starfish, which can devastate corals; butterfly fish and parrot fish, which eat corals; and marine turtles, which eat <b>jellyfish.</b> Some sea anemones and <b>jellyfish</b> have a symbiotic relationship with some fish; for example clown fish live among the tentacles of sea anemones, and each partner protects the other against predators.|$|E
50|$|Pelagia is a genus of <b>jellyfishes</b> in {{the family}} Pelagiidae.|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Jellyfishes</b> {{belong to}} the phylum Cnidarians {{with a wide range}} of size, from 22 centimeters to 2. 5 meters. <b>Jellyfishes</b> have a {{worldwide}} distribution comprising over nine thousands species that approximately, 100 species are dangerous for humans. The venoms of these organisms contain biomolecules with extensive activities which could be used as a source of novel drugs in the future. Materials and Methods: The PubMed data bank was searched for the term “Jellyfish”. A total of 1677 papers were found. These papers were divided into three categories: medical, biomedical and biotechnological fields. The medical category was further divided into three subcategories comprising systemic manifestations, cutaneous manifestations and treatments for the stings of <b>jellyfishes.</b> The biomedical category was further subdivided into genomics, proteomics, and biology of venoms, mechanisms of actions and products of biomedical significance. In this part of systematic review, the biomedical and biotechnological and biotechnological fields were evaluated. Results: The genomics and proteomics of 24 species of <b>jellyfishes</b> had been studied in details. The mechanisms of actions of the venoms of 23 species were under investigations. The hematologic (hemolytic effects), cardiotoxic, neurotoxic, dermonecrotic, immunologic and cytotoxic presentations for the venoms were reported. Similar clinical presentations could be produced by different species of <b>jellyfishes</b> with a vast of molecular action mechanisms. Bioactive molecules with cytotoxic, anticancer, antibacterial and antioxidant effects were isolated from the venoms. Conclusion: The venoms of <b>jellyfishes</b> have bioactive molecules that produce a variety of complex intracellular interactions. Hence, the studies on the venomics of <b>jellyfishes</b> and the mechanisms of actions of their venoms could progress the therapeutic interventions and promise novel marine drugs...|$|R

5|$|Discs : Circular fossils, such as Ediacaria, Cyclomedusa and Rugoconites led to {{the initial}} {{identification}} of Ediacaran fossils as cnidaria, which include <b>jellyfish</b> and corals. Further examination has provided alternative interpretations of all disc-shaped fossils: not one is now confidently recognised as a <b>jellyfish.</b> Alternate explanations include holdfasts and protists; the patterns displayed where two meet have led to many 'individuals' being identified as microbial colonies, and yet others may represent scratch marks formed as stalked organisms spun around their holdfasts. Useful diagnostic characters are often lacking because only {{the underside of the}} organism is preserved by fossilisation.|$|E

40|$|<b>Jellyfishes</b> have {{functionally}} replaced several overexploited {{commercial stocks}} of planktivorous fishes. This is paradoxical, because {{they use a}} primitive prey capture mechanism requiring {{direct contact with the}} prey, whereas fishes use more efficient visual detection. We have compiled published data to show that, in spite of their primitive life-style, <b>jellyfishes</b> exhibit similar instantaneous prey clearance and respiration rates as their fish competitors and similar potential for growth and reproduction. To achieve this production, they have evolved large, water-laden bodies that increase prey contact rates. Although larger bodies are less efficient for swimming, optimization analysis reveals that large collectors are advantageous if they move through the water sufficiently slowly...|$|R
5|$|Transparency is common, even dominant, {{in animals}} {{of the open}} sea, {{especially}} those that live in relatively shallow waters. It is found in plankton of many species, as well as larger animals such as <b>jellyfish,</b> salps (floating tunicates), and comb jellies.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescence occurs widely among animals, {{especially}} in the open sea, including fish, <b>jellyfish,</b> comb jellies, crustaceans, and cephalopod molluscs; in some fungi and bacteria; and in various terrestrial invertebrates including insects. About 76% of the main taxa of deep-sea animals produce light. Most marine light-emission is in the blue and green light spectrum. However, some loose-jawed fish emit red and infrared light, and the genus Tomopteris emits yellow light.|$|E

40|$|Swarming {{dynamics}} of scyphozoan jelly fishes have great in-fluence on the coastal ecosystem, wherein some scyphozoan are filter feeder {{and others are}} piscivores/carnivores. The summer swarming of <b>jellyfishes</b> along the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay coast was monitored since 2013 during the months from April to September, and different species of jelly fishes could be recorded in the coastal waters. Furthermore the beach seine operation hauls in several tons of <b>jellyfishes</b> during their operation along this coast, creating a nuisance situation in the fishing operation. Hence {{the present study was}} attempted to document the different species of jelly fishes which are found in the coastal waters of Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay...|$|R
40|$|The {{ecology of}} cubozoans is poorly {{understood}} {{and there are}} few quantitative studies on their distribution patterns. Sampling was designed to test first for variation in abundance with distance across the continental shelf in waters of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Second, we tested for the possible influence of islands versus submerged reefs on the abundances of cubozoan <b>jellyfishes.</b> <b>Jellyfishes</b> were collected after attraction to tethered night lights. Additional sampling focused on turbid near-shore waters. Carybdeid <b>jellyfishes</b> were found at mainland, inner, and mid-shelf reefs during summers between 2007 and 2010. No cubozoan medusae were found at outer reef sites. Copula sivickisi and Carukia barnesi were more abundant near reefs with islands than at fully submerged reefs. There {{was no evidence of}} lunar periodicity in abundance for these cubozoan taxa. Chironex fleckeri medusae were only found close to shore near the mainland, but they were rarely observed when riverine runoff was high. All taxa were characterized by high spatial and temporal variation and there was some evidence for small populations at spatial scales of less than one kilometer. "Blooms" and related intensity of predation and risk to humans are most likely at small spatial scales...|$|R
