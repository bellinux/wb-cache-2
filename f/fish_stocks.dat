5|$|The fishery {{industry}} {{not only}} threatens marine mammals through by-catch, but also through competition for food. Large scale fisheries {{have led to}} the depletion of <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> that are important prey species for marine mammals. Pinnipeds have been especially affected by the direct loss of food supplies and in some cases the harvesting of fish has led to food shortages or dietary deficiencies, starvation of young, and reduced recruitment into the population. As the <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> have been depleted, the competition between marine mammals and fisheries has sometimes led to conflict. Large-scale culling of populations of marine mammals by commercial fishers has been initiated {{in a number of areas}} in order to protect <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> for human consumption.|$|E
5|$|Today, Japan {{maintains}} {{one of the}} world's largest fishing fleets {{and accounts}} for nearly 15% of the global catch, prompting some claims that Japan's fishing is leading to depletion in <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> such as tuna. Japan has also sparked controversy by supporting quasi-commercial whaling.|$|E

5|$|As <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> dwindle in {{the upper}} ocean, deep-sea {{fisheries}} are increasingly being targeted for exploitation. Because deep sea fish are long-lived and slow growing, these deep-sea fisheries are not thought to be sustainable {{in the long term}} given current management practices. Changes in primary production in the photic zone are expected to alter the standing stocks in the food-limited aphotic zone.|$|E
5|$|One ctenophore, Mnemiopsis, has accidentally been {{introduced}} into the Black Sea, where it is blamed for causing <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> to collapse by eating both fish larvae and organisms that would otherwise have fed the fish. The situation was aggravated by other factors, such as over-fishing and long-term environmental changes that promoted {{the growth of the}} Mnemiopsis population. The later accidental introduction of Beroe helped to mitigate the problem, as Beroe preys on other ctenophores.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the seaside}} location, few {{residents}} {{make their living}} on the sea, and fishing {{is not a major}} industry. In the early 1970s, when <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> ran low, a system of rotating access was developed to preserve this sector. This innovative system was part of Elinor Ostrom's research on economic governance which led to her 2009 Nobel Prize in Economics. In 2007, locals protested the establishment of some larger chain supermarkets and clothing stores, which have opened branches in Alanya.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>stock</b> {{forms the}} basis of many dishes, {{particularly}} soups and sauces. A fish consommé {{is a type of}} clear soup made from richly flavored <b>fish</b> <b>stock</b> that has been clarified usually through a fining process involving egg protein. Fish consommés usually have too little natural gelatin, so the <b>fish</b> <b>stock</b> may be double-cooked or supplemented. Since fish gelatin melts at a lower temperature than gelatins of other meats, fish aspic is more delicate and melts more readily in the mouth. Dehydrated stock can be formed into small cubes (pictured at right) called stock cubes.|$|R

5|$|Fishermen have {{traditionally}} used seabirds {{as indicators of}} both fish shoals, underwater banks that might indicate <b>fish</b> <b>stocks,</b> and of potential landfall. In fact, the known association of seabirds with land was instrumental in allowing the Polynesians to locate tiny landmasses in the Pacific. Seabirds have provided food for fishermen away from home, as well as bait. Famously, tethered cormorants {{have been used to}} catch fish directly. Indirectly, fisheries have also benefited from guano from colonies of seabirds acting as fertilizer for the surrounding seas.|$|E
5|$|Regular {{stocking}} {{since the}} start of the 1980s have re-established reasonable populations of golden perch and Murray cod; native fish that were indigenous to the Molonglo River before the lake was built, but had been lost to mining pollution of the Molonglo River in the first half of the 20th century. The main reason for stocking is to boost <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> along the Molonglo, which have been depleted by overfishing, introduced species and habitat destruction. One of the motives for raising the level of Murray cod and golden perch is to balance the ecosystem by having them act as native predators of other fish.|$|E
5|$|The Dalmatian pelican is {{the rarest}} species with a {{population}} estimated at between 10,000 and 20,000 following massive declines in the 19th and 20th centuries.

5|$|Of the 22 {{species of}} {{albatross}} recognised by the IUCN, all {{are listed as}} at some level of concern; 3 species are Critically Endangered, 5 species are Endangered, 7 species are Near Threatened, and 7 species are Vulnerable. Numbers of albatrosses have declined in the past due to harvesting for feathers, but today the albatrosses are threatened by introduced species, such as rats and feral cats that attack eggs, chicks and nesting adults; by pollution; by a serious decline in <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> in many regions largely due to overfishing; and by longline fishing. Longline fisheries pose the greatest threat, as feeding birds are attracted to the bait, become hooked on the lines, and drown. Identified stakeholders such as governments, conservation organisations {{and people in the}} fishing industry are all working toward reducing this bycatch.|$|E
5|$|Besides these {{international}} initiatives, {{some countries}} {{are taking their}} own actions. New Zealand has banned the taking of manta rays since {{the introduction of the}} Wildlife Act in 1953. In June 1995, the Maldives banned the export of all ray species and their body parts, effectively putting a stop to manta fishing as there had not previously been a fishery for local consumption. The government reinforced this in 2009 with the introduction of two marine protected areas. In the Philippines, the taking of mantas was banned in 1998, but this was overturned in 1999 under pressure from local fishermen. <b>Fish</b> <b>stocks</b> were surveyed in 2002, and the ban was reintroduced. The taking or killing of mantas in Mexican waters was prohibited in 2007. This ban may not be strictly enforced, but laws are being more rigidly applied at Isla Holbox, an island off the Yucatán Peninsula, where manta rays are used to attract tourists.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{the problem}} of ammonia levels in the final {{effluent}} was addressed by {{the construction of a}} system using anoxic zones and diffuse air activated sludge treatment. This dramatically reduced ammonia levels, and was the most significant factor in the re-establishment of <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> in the lower River Don. In 1990, the outdated filter presshouse and incineration plant were replaced by a new sludge-dewatering plant and a fluidized-bed incinerator. The new plant made the old sludge beds, situated to the east of the River Don and on the island formed by the Don and the Holmes Cut, redundant, and these have now become a nature reserve. Further improvements to the process were completed by 2005. These included an upgrade to the wet scrubbing system, in order to remove heavy metals and acid gases such as sulphur dioxide, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride from the flue gases produced by the incinerator, and the addition of a tertiary adsorption filter, which removes mercury and dioxins. The improvements were designed to ensure that the plant met the standards set out in the Waste Incineration Directive.|$|E

5|$|The works {{had its own}} {{internal}} standard gauge railway for over 100 years, which used three steam and three diesel locomotives {{over the course of}} its existence, until its replacement by road vehicles in the 1990s. During the 1926 general strike, the locomotives hauled trains over the main line, delivering wagons to Kilnhurst tip under a special dispensation. By the 1960s, the Sheffield sewer system was inadequate for the volume of effluent produced, and the Don Valley Interceptor Sewer was tunnelled beneath the city to the works, enabling 26 storm sewage overflows into the river to be shut down. Water quality was further improved by a new treatment process installed in 1992 to reduce ammonia levels, enabling <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> to be re-established in the lower River Don. Subsequent improvements have been made so that the works complies with the Waste Incineration Directive and the Freshwater Fish Directive. The works was inundated by flood water on 25 June 2007, when the Don burst its banks, but was recommissioned in just 18 days.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species have}} become so {{numerous}} that they conflict with local people. In the United States, pinnipeds are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA). Since that year, California sea lion populations have risen to 250,000. These animals began exploiting more man-made environments, like docks, for haul-out sites. Many docks are not designed to withstand the weight of several resting sea lions. Wildlife managers have used various methods to control the animals, and some city officials have redesigned docks so they can better withstand use by sea lions. Sea lions also conflict with fisherman since both depend on the same <b>fish</b> <b>stocks.</b> In 2007, MMPA was amended to permit the lethal removal of sea lions from salmon runs at Bonneville Dam. The 2007 law seeks to relieve pressure on the crashing Pacific Northwest salmon populations. Wildlife officials have unsuccessfully attempted {{to ward off the}} sea lions using bombs, rubber bullets and bean bags. Efforts to chase sea lions away from the area have also proven ineffective. Critics like the Humane Society object to the killing of the sea lions, claiming that hydroelectric dams pose a greater threat to the salmon. Similar conflicts have existed in South Africa with brown fur seals. In the 1980s and 1990s, South African politicians and fisherman demanded that the fur seals be culled, believing that the animals competed with commercial fisheries. Scientific studies found that culling fur seals would actually {{have a negative effect on}} the fishing industry, and the culling option was dropped in 1993.|$|E

40|$|A basic fish-stock {{assessment}} system {{requires an}} integrated {{use of a}} model for the time evolution of a <b>fish</b> <b>stock</b> and information about the <b>fish</b> <b>stock</b> from catch data. Typical for common <b>fish</b> <b>stock</b> assessment systems have been the use of fairly simplistic data assimilation methodologies for the integration of observations with the dynamical models. On the other hand, there has been a fast development of new sophisticated assimilation techniques which can be used with highly nonlinear and complex dynamical models. In this paper some of these new methods, which are based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo formulations, will be examined with a simple <b>fish</b> <b>stock</b> model where they are shown to provide a more consistent estimate than traditional data assimilation methods. In addition, they also provide statistical error-bars in terms of error covariances for the estimates. The methods used are the ensemble Kalman filter, the ensemble Kalman smoother and the simpler ensemble smoother. 1 [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Swedish <b>fish</b> <b>stocking</b> policy {{constitutes}} {{an example of}} the disparate challenges associated with adaptive management theory and the realization thereof.
