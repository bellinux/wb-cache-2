5|$|Braham's {{return to}} Britain {{was not a}} welcome one. His family found him {{exceptionally}} difficult to live with. His short temper and aggressiveness manifested themselves when journalists came to the family's home in Leicestershire searching for a war-story to print. Braham, who despised publicity, physically ejected them from his property. His decision to shut the media {{out of his life}} likely explains why, even {{as one of the most}} successful aces, he was virtually unknown in Britain outside the RAF. Braham had also become despondent about the political climate <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> reduced Winston Churchill to Leader of the Opposition, where the black market was rife and rationing was set to become an indefinite feature of post-war Britain into the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Gunnerkrigg Court {{is set in}} a {{boarding}} school <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> resembles the United Kingdom, identifiable from the grey skies and mandatory uniforms. The comic contains other clues about the setting, such as the house system that is described {{at the end of the}} first chapter. This system is similar to that used by many UK schools, including the one the author attended; Siddell has even stated that the school in which Gunnerkrigg Court takes place is modeled after his own secondary school.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 Riga summit {{was held}} in Riga, Latvia, and {{highlighted}} the issue of energy security. It was the first NATO summit to be held <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> {{had been part of}} the Soviet Union. At the April 2008 summit in Bucharest, Romania, NATO agreed to the accession of Croatia and Albania and both countries joined NATO in April 2009. Ukraine and Georgia were also told that they could eventually become members. The issue of Georgian and Ukrainian membership in NATO prompted harsh criticism from Russia, as did NATO plans for a missile defence system. Studies for this system began in 2002, with negotiations centered on anti-ballistic missiles being stationed in Poland and the Czech Republic. Though NATO leaders gave assurances that the system was not targeting Russia, both presidents Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev criticized it as a threat.|$|E
60|$|It {{was rather}} {{alarming}} to find oneself on {{a sudden the}} wife of <b>a</b> man <b>in</b> Arthur's position. I was dreadfully self-conscious; I felt that everybody's eyes were upon me. And you don't know {{how easy it is}} to make mistakes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that's</b> half Eastern and half European.|$|R
50|$|After recognition, {{the record}} {{was broken by}} another school <b>in</b> <b>a</b> European <b>country</b> <b>that</b> lasted 40 hours.|$|R

5|$|Once the {{candidate}} cities are selected, they must {{submit to the}} IOC a bigger and more detailed presentation of their project {{as part of a}} candidature file. Each city is thoroughly analysed by an evaluation commission. This commission will also visit {{the candidate}} cities, interviewing local officials and inspecting prospective venue sites, and submit a report on its findings one month prior to the IOC's final decision. During the interview process the candidate city must also guarantee that {{it will be able to}} fund the Games. After the work of the evaluation commission, a list of candidates is presented to the General Session of the IOC, which must assemble <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> does not have a candidate city in the running. The IOC members gathered in the Session have the final vote on the host city. Once elected, the host city bid committee (together with the NOC of the respective country) signs a Host City Contract with the IOC, officially becoming an Olympic host nation and host city.|$|E

25|$|What {{we have to}} do is to reform, to civilize our masquerades, {{because we}} ought not to let these days of popular {{diversion}} disappear from among us, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> has suffered so much.|$|E
5000|$|Hamdallah {{spoke about}} {{the first time he}} arrived at Norway, stating: [...] "It was a {{difficult}} experience because I arrived <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that's</b> very cold, but through an effort of will, I overcame every obstacle. I was the first player from the Moroccan championship to come to Norway, and my signing generated a lot of attention in the newspapers. In the end, I was able to silence my critics by finishing as one of the leading scorers in the league." ...|$|R

50|$|Bill Harper (Rogers) {{plays an}} American ambassador. After his arrival <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small <b>country</b> <b>that</b> is besieged by civil unrest, he befriends {{the young boy}} (Tad Alexander) who {{is to be the}} country's king.|$|R
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> was {{the first}} in the world to approve {{same-sex}} marriage by constitutional referendum, it seems safe to expect that the referendum proposal will be carried by a very large majority, as part of the gradual removal of anachronistic measures from the constitution.|$|E
25|$|Since {{then and}} {{for nearly two}} years until summer 1920 the Italian Protectorate over Albania was {{administered}} by the Italian government: <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> lacked nearly everything after centuries of Ottoman rule, were built 546km of new roads, 110km of new railroads, 3000km of telegraph lines, 9 teleferics, a few hospitals and some modern administrative buildings.|$|E
25|$|The anti-religious {{campaign}} {{of the past}} decade and the terror tactics of the militantly atheist regime, had effectively eliminated all public expressions of religion and communal gatherings of believers outside of the walls of the few churches (or mosques, synagogues, etc.) that still held services. This was accomplished <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> only a few decades earlier had had a deeply Christian public life and culture that had developed for almost a thousand years.|$|E
50|$|If passed, the {{amendment}} would have represented {{the first time}} <b>in</b> <b>an</b> EU <b>country</b> <b>that</b> voters {{would have been able}} to dissolve their national parliament - a right traditionally reserved for the head of state.|$|R
50|$|English Americans, also {{referred}} to as Anglo-Americans, are Americans whose ancestry originates wholly or partly <b>in</b> England, <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> is part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.In the 2014 American Community Survey, English Americans are (7.6%) of the total population.|$|R
50|$|Unsafe {{abortion}}s {{often occur}} where abortion is illegal. However, {{the prevalence of}} unsafe abortion may also be determined by other factors, such as whether it occurs <b>in</b> <b>a</b> developing <b>country</b> <b>that</b> has <b>a</b> low level of competent medical care.|$|R
25|$|The {{expulsion}} of the industrious Jews, Moors, and Moriscos {{did nothing to}} advance the Spanish economy. The small scattered groups of Moriscos lived largely by subsistence farming in marginal mountain areas or by unskilled laboring <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> had very many underemployed hands. A council set up to investigate the matter in Castile found little effect, but in parts of Aragon and especially Valencia, where half the Moriscos had lived, and had made up a substantial minority of the population, the impact was certainly noticeable for the noblemen who had lost rents.|$|E
25|$|The {{gap between}} rich and poor is {{enormous}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> was once the most egalitarian nation in the world. In the youth movements, Zionism was seen as the Jewish way of achieving social justice that would encompass the whole world. That ideal has been shattered. Now we have the pretension of being an open and attentive socialist welfare state, but in fact, that message only comes from a single direction. The system only responds to those who shout. Those who are silent remain on the outside. The basic human element has disappeared from the system.|$|E
25|$|The main {{themes in}} Brennan's short stories are {{feelings}} of loneliness, vulnerability, despair, spite, and fear. She often wrote about unhappy, loveless marriages {{and people with}} claustrophobic, sad and disappointed lives. Her studies of these relationships sometimes have a cruel tone. Another theme is about how the individual's need for expression is countered and restricted by the need for societal acceptance <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> clung to traditions steeped {{in the church and}} strict convention. For example, in The Devil In Us she describes a convent school that uses morals to cruelly stop any type of nonconformity.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} {{demographic}} threat (or demographic bomb) is <b>a</b> term used <b>in</b> political conversation {{to refer to}} population increases from within a minority ethnic group <b>in</b> <b>a</b> given <b>country</b> <b>that</b> are perceived as threatening to alter the ethnic identity of <b>that</b> <b>country.</b>|$|R
50|$|Afghan Luke is a 2011 Canadian film {{directed}} by Mike Clattenburg. The central character, Luke Benning (Nick Stahl), {{is a journalist}} investigating the possible mutilation (by Canadian snipers) of corpses <b>in</b> Afghanistan, <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> appears increasingly incomprehensible and surreal as Luke undergoes a series of bizarre adventures.|$|R
50|$|An {{expatriate}} (often shortened to expat) is {{a person}} temporarily or permanently residing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> other than <b>that</b> of their citizenship.|$|R
25|$|Afghans are {{regarded}} with mingled apprehension and condescension, for their high regard for personal honor, for their tribe loyalty {{and for their}} readiness {{to use force to}} settle disputes. As tribal warfare and internecine feuding has been one of their chief occupations since time immemorial, this individualistic trait has made it difficult for foreigners to conquer them. One writer considers the tribal system to be the best way of organizing large groups of people <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> is geographically difficult, and in a society that, from a materialistic point of view, has an uncomplicated lifestyle. There are various Afghan tribes, and an estimated 2–3 million nomads.|$|E
25|$|Li began two megaprojects {{when he was}} the Premier. He {{initiated}} the construction of the Three Gorges Dam on 14 December 1994, and later began preparations for the Shenzhou Manned Space Program. Both programs were subject to much controversy within China and abroad. The Shenzhou program was especially criticized due to its extraordinary cost (tens of billions of dollars) <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> sometimes referred to itself as a Third World nation. Many economists and humanitarians suggested that those billions in capital might be better invested in helping the Chinese population deal with economic hardships and improvement in the China's education, health services, and legal system.|$|E
25|$|As usual, {{operations}} {{began with}} the sieges, necessary to conciliate local feeling. Plymouth and Lyme Regis were blocked up, and Taunton again invested. The reinforcement thrown into the last place by Waller and Cromwell was dismissed by Blake (then a colonel {{in command of the}} fortress (afterwards, the great admiral of the Commonwealth). After many adventures, Blake rejoined Waller and Cromwell. The latter generals, who had not yet laid down their commissions, then engaged Goring for some weeks. Neither side had infantry or artillery, and both found subsistence difficult in February and March. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> had been fought over for the two years past, no results were to be expected. Taunton still remained unrelieved, and Goring's horse still rode all over Dorsetshire, when the New Model at last took the field.|$|E
5000|$|The {{number of}} food banks has {{increased}} rapidly even <b>in</b> Germany, <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> has weathered the crisis relatively well, {{and has not}} needed to implement severe austerity. In 2012, professor Sabine Pfeiffer of Munich University of Applied Sciences said {{there has been an}} [...] "explosion" [...] of food bank usage.|$|R
5000|$|A {{national}} liquor is {{an alcoholic}} drink considered a standard and respected adult beverage <b>in</b> <b>a</b> given <b>country.</b> While {{the status of}} such drinks may be informal, there is usually <b>a</b> general consensus <b>in</b> <b>a</b> given <b>country</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> specific drink is the national beverage or [...] "most popular liquor".|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, 122 German {{communities}} {{had been}} created in Rio Grande do Sul, and many others in Santa Catarina, Paraná, São Paulo, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro. Germans helped to establish <b>a</b> middle-class population <b>in</b> Brazil, <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> was formerly divided between slaves and their masters.|$|R
25|$|The {{success of}} The Ostrobothnians {{was due to}} a {{confluence}} of factors: {{the appeal of the}} music, tonal but darkly colored; the use of folk melodies (blended with Madetoja's own idiom) familiar to the audience; a libretto (also by Madetoja) based upon a well-known and beloved play; a story about freedom from oppression and self-determination, the allegorical qualities of which were particularly salient <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> had recently emerged from a war for independence; and, the skillful combination of comedic and tragic elements. The introduction to Act I (No. 2: Prisoner's Song in the suite), for example, is based upon a famous Ostrobothnian folk song, Tuuli se taivutti koivun larvan (The Wind Bent the Birch), {{which was one of the}} 262 folk songs Kuula had collected during his travels and which made its way into Madetoja's nationalistic opera, becoming its signature leitmotif.|$|E
25|$|Some recruits, {{due to the}} {{sensitivity}} of their position or their personalities not being appropriate for cell leadership, might not enter cells but be run as singletons, perhaps by other than the recruiting case officer. Asset BARD is {{a different sort of}} highly sensitive singleton, who is a joint asset of the country B, and the country identified by prefix AR. ARNOLD is a case officer from the country AR embassy, who knows only the case officer BERTRAM and the security officer BEST. ARNOLD does not know the station chief of BERRY or any of its other personnel. Other than BELL and BEST, the Station personnel only know BERTRAM as someone authorized to be in the Station, and who is known for his piano playing at embassy parties. He is covered as Cultural Attache, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> has very few pianos. Only the personnel involved with BARD know that ARNOLD is other than another friendly diplomat.|$|E
500|$|Neild's adventures {{had seen}} him lose respect in his {{political}} career, and he was now openly mocked in the Senate chamber, becoming something of a joke. He introduced a number of bills in his remaining {{five years in the}} Senate, all of which lapsed. He spoke in support of Muslim camel drivers and opposed military training for boys, and continued to oppose elements of the White Australia policy, raising concerns about Australian-born children of Kanaka labourers: [...] "They will have difficulties enough in front of them <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> is so rampantly strong on the white Australia policy without our making their case worse." [...] Neild was defeated at the 1910 election.|$|E
