The shot {{featured}} {{on the front page}} of Picture Post magazine in 1944, proving women could be fearless as well as glamorous, and integral to the war effort.|$|E
25|$|The cover artwork for {{the single}} depicts the song's lyrics written {{on top of a}} woman's face, {{depicted}} in 1980s-style vivid coloring. The image is an altered picture of the band's bassist Ami Kusakari from the photoshoot for the band's album Shin-shiro, as she brushed <b>hair</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her eyes. The covers were made by design team Hatos, who have worked with Sakanaction since their second album Night Fishing. Yamaguchi requested something relating to Japanese psychedelic literature, and to the 1980s, but never considered that Hatos would put the song's lyrics on the cover.|$|E
500|$|At {{one point}} in the episode's production, the pill would read [...] "Roofie", but it was {{eventually}} removed. Another scene that changed during production was the scene in which Homer uses Marge's hair to clean him up for their date. After he takes Marge's <b>hair</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his ear, her hair would originally be covered with earwax, but it was removed when the animators looked over the episode's storyboard. The second segment originally had many more shots of buffalo being shot, but some were changed so that the deaths were off-camera.|$|E
6000|$|From {{the bedroom}} beside the sleeping-porch, his wife's detestably cheerful [...] "Time to get up, Georgie boy," [...] and the itchy sound, the brisk and scratchy sound, <b>of</b> combing <b>hairs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a stiff brush.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Scraps, [...] "suppose {{we go in}} {{and find}} him? Very likely if we ask him politely to let us pull three <b>hairs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the tip of his}} tail he won't hurt us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{judge has}} three, but he's so fussy about them he won't even let us pull a few <b>hairs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> old Major's tail to make rings of," [...] said Betty, {{shutting}} her arithmetic, with an injured expression.|$|R
500|$|As well as {{the many}} {{augmented}} and adapted editions of Raspe's text, the fictional Baron has occasionally appeared in other standalone works. In 1838–39, Karl Leberecht Immermann published the long novel Münchhausen: Eine Geschichte in Arabesken (Münchhausen: A History of Arabesques) as an homage to the character, and Adolf Ellissen's Munchausens Lügenabenteur, an elaborate expansion of the stories, appeared in 1846. In his 1886 philosophical treatise Beyond Good and Evil, Friedrich Nietzsche uses one of the Baron's adventures, {{the one in which}} he rescues himself from a swamp, as a metaphor for belief in complete metaphysical free will; Nietzsche calls this belief an attempt [...] "to pull oneself up into existence by the <b>hair,</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the swamps of nothingness".|$|E
500|$|... "Como Duele" [...] is a latin pop ballad about [...] "the monotony that {{attacks the}} couples that have many years together, {{the lack of}} passion and regretted love that seems to pose over them." [...] Jason Birchmeier from Allmusic called the song [...] "phenomenal", and {{considered}} it as to be [...] "his biggest hits in years". He also named it, alongside [...] "Sin Ti.. Sin Mi" [...] and [...] "El Del Espejo", to be a standout track from the album. An editor from El Mercurio Online commented that [...] "Como Duele" [...] is [...] "a ballad of merciless chords and lyrics plagued of contradictions made metaphors." [...] He also stated that [...] "Is the logic of [...] 'Olvidarte', that song in which the guatemalan talked about making something as difficult as 'pulling the <b>hair</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a bottle'," [...] and compared it to his past song [...] "Olvidarte", from Sin Daños a Terceros.|$|E
500|$|Rihanna's voice spans one-and-a-half octaves in [...] "Only Girl (In the World)", from F3 to C5, and her vocal has a [...] "silky", [...] "seductive" [...] tone. In the song's lyrics Rihanna yearns for her lover's attention, {{which makes}} her feel like the only girl in the world. The singer [...] "pours her heart out" [...] in the chorus: [...] "Want you {{to make me feel}} like I'm the only girl in the world/ Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love/ Like I'm the only one who knows your heart/ Only girl in the world." [...] According to Digital Spy writer Nick Levine, the chorus [...] "thumps like a rabbit having an epileptic fit." [...] Rihanna sings suggestively, [...] "Baby, I'll tell you all my secrets that I'm keepin'/ You can come inside/ And when you enter, you ain't leavin'/ Be my {{prisoner}} for the night." [...] Fraser McAlpine of the BBC compared the song's message to that of the German fairy tale [...] "Rapunzel"; Rihanna is not willing to throw her <b>hair</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the castle for just any man to come and satisfy her, [...] "particularly not someone who isn't prepared to make the climb up to her scarily high window." ...|$|E
6000|$|So the Shaggy Man tried it, but pull {{as hard as}} {{he could}} he failed to get the <b>hairs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Woozy's tail. So he sat down again and wiped his shaggy face with a shaggy silk {{handkerchief}} and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|The fox {{thanked him}} heartily, tore two <b>hairs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his bushy tail, and said: 'Should you ever stand {{in need of}} my help throw these two hairs into the fire, {{and in a moment}} I shall be at your side ready to obey you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, she's somewhere round," [...] {{returned}} Nan, {{with most}} unmaternal carelessness. [...] "I made you a ring coming along, {{and pulled the}} <b>hairs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Dobbin's tail. Don't you want it?" [...] and Nan presented a horse-hair ring in token of friendship, as they had both vowed they would never speak to one another again when they last parted.|$|R
500|$|Mark Deming of {{the website}} AllMusic {{commented that the}} album [...] "captures her {{dazzling}} live act as she shines in a performance." [...] A writer of MTV News commented that the album contained [...] "more than two hours' worth of content in total". Kurt Orzeck of the same publication commented that the DVD showcases a [...] "huge" [...] tour. Scott Kara of Time Out also praised the [...] "thrilling, booty-shaking pizzazz" [...] of the DVD adding that fans would feel [...] "just like being there [...] ". An editor of the website Jam! graded the DVD with {{four out of five}} stars, calling it a spectacle. The editor further noted, [...] " [...] has the giant stage, the massive lights, the troupe of dancers, the kickass all-girl band, the costume changes, the VIPs and more. But all of it can't pull focus from the incredible Ms. Knowles, who works it for two-plus hours, wailing and gyrating through a sweat-soaked show with nary a <b>hair</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> place." [...] Grading the DVD with three out of four stars, Chuck Arnold and Ivory Jeff Clinton from People magazine wrote, [...] "The elaborate production gets a bit overblown at times, but in this concert... the tireless diva is a veritable force of nature on high-energy numbers such as 'Crazy in Love' and 'Déjà Vu.'" [...] The live version of [...] "Me, Myself and I" [...] (2003) from The Beyoncé Experience Live gained a nomination for Best Female R Vocal Performance at the 51st Grammy Awards in 2009.|$|E
500|$|An {{aspect of}} Chrissie's {{personality}} is her wardrobe and style, with EastEnders costume designer Di Humphreys noting that [...] "Chrissie's clothes reflect her strong, upfront character." [...] According to Oberman the production team was keen to emphasise {{this in the}} manner of her dress: [...] "For Chrissie's wardrobe, we decided she is dressy and over co-ordinated", explaining how the character's fashion sense was informed by her own observations of British expatriates: [...] "When I heard I had the part of Chrissie I was on holiday in Spain, where she had been living, and I remember looking at all the ex-pat women, and thinking how co-ordinated they are. Their hair is always perfect, their bags match their gloves and shoes and scarves." [...] The show's make-up artist, Elizabeth Armistead, has also spoken of the way Chrissie's [...] "glamorous, polished look" [...] informs her characterisation and personality: [...] "Chrissie's a confident person who rarely leaves anything to chance. Even in moments of despair, though her facial expression reflects her turmoil, she never has a <b>hair</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> place." [...] The look was part of a desire to represent the character as a [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "forceful" [...] figure, with one interviewer describing Chrissie as [...] "quite flashy" [...] and [...] "glam". According to Humprehys this is manifested in [...] "Chrissie’s outfits, [...] are a mixture of designer and High Street... Chrissie's got a great sense of style. She makes High Street clothes look made to measure." [...] Oberman felt Chrissie's fashion sensibilities to be a critical element of the character: [...] "she's like Angie with 15 more years of Sex and The City thrown in", referring to an American televisied serial notable for fashion. Even before stepping foot on set Oberman spent eight hours with Humphreys shopping for Chrissie's clothes at Selfridges where they [...] "spent a fortune!" [...] The character's highly stylised representation on-screen earned Oberman the award for best-dressed soap star in 2005, and reflected Chrissie's new-found role as the [...] "voluptuous landlady" [...] of The Queen Vic. In the media the character was widely regarded as the show's ultimate femme fatale and resident [...] "sex symbol", being described by John Dingwall of the Daily Record as Walford's [...] "black widow".|$|E
2500|$|In {{many of the}} Stooge shorts, the Larry {{character}} {{did more}} reacting than acting, staying {{in the background and}} serving as the voice of reason in contrast to the zany antics of Moe and Curly. [...] He was a surrealistic foil and the middle ground between Moe's gruffly [...] "bossy", and Curly's childish personae. Like the other Stooges, Larry was often {{on the receiving end of}} Moe's abuse. His reasonableness was the perfect foil to Moe's brusque bluntness and Curly or Shemp's boyish immaturity, but Larry would sometimes propose something impossible or illogical and be quickly put down by Moe, both verbally and physically, who would often react by pulling a handful of <b>hair</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Larry's head.|$|E
6000|$|... "Emergency call? For me? Put it through." [...] Kramer came awake, {{brushing}} his <b>hair</b> back <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his eyes. Alarm plucked at him.|$|R
5000|$|Once upon a {{time there}} was, in country far, far, far away, a king called Jozef (Jan Decleir), and his wife, queen Angina (Karine Tanghe). King Jozef thought {{the time was right}} for his daughter, princess Prieeltje (Ianka Fleerackers), to get married and king Jozef set up a special contest. The first young man to pull the three golden <b>hairs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Mother Devil's head got the chance to marry the princess.|$|R
50|$|Snot Me - {{two people}} go {{head to head}} picking <b>hairs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a gunge filled nose. The loser would get gunged if the trigger hair was pulled. Quiche Lorraine - An elderly lady 'Lorraine' walked across a field whilst quiche tarts were catapulted at her from a medieval trebuchet. Who's Bin Here? - A game played in the early episodes of the digital channel format, a bin was emptied of {{contents}} which alluded to a celebrity owner.|$|R
2500|$|In 1545, he {{was seriously}} wounded at the Second Siege of Boulogne, but recovered. He was struck with a lance {{through the bars}} of his helmet. The steel head pierced both cheeks, and [...] of the shaft were snapped off by the {{violence}} of the blow. He sat firm in his saddle, and rode back unassisted to his tent and when the surgeon thought he would die of pain, when the iron was extracted, ' he bore it as easily {{as if it had been}} but the plucking of a <b>hair</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his head.'* Francis of Lorraine bore the scar of that wound to his grave; but he lived to repay the stroke by waving the fleurs-de-lys on the battlements of Calais, while the remnants of the last English garrison were taking leave forever of the soil of France.|$|E
2500|$|Glau {{trained with}} stunt {{coordinator}} Joel Kramer {{to prepare for}} the physical demands of her role. In learning martial arts for Serenity, Glau used her training in ballet to learn fight scenes by counts, as if they were choreographies. About bringing the practice to Terminator, Glau said, [...] "When you're working with a stunt guy ... and you need to anticipate every swing he's going to take at you ... it's important that you know exactly the timing that it's all going to play out." [...] Training focused heavily on the destruction of breakable set pieces, safety in hand-to-hand fights and the use of a variety of firearms. Glau was challenged during fight scenes by not being able to move or act humanly by things such as pushing her <b>hair</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her face. Glau modeled Cameron's walk after that of a dressage horse for its precision.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But I {{gave him}} a dig in the nose,' cried Maurice, in exultation; 'I pulled ever so much <b>hair</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his whiskers. I had it just now.' ...|$|E
50|$|Each {{of their}} album covers {{features}} <b>hair</b> growing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> skin. Sometimes a woman, sometimes a man, or sometimes {{a circle of}} flesh surrounded by hair.|$|R
50|$|The tomb was {{discovered}} by Giovanni Belzoni in 1817. Belzoni described how easily the <b>hair</b> came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> one of the mummies when he tugged at it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Splendid. He's got a {{great red}} face like a leg of mutton, and on his right cheek there's an {{enormous}} mole with long <b>hairs</b> growing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it." ...|$|R
60|$|L. Stop! {{that puts}} me {{in mind of}} {{something}} I had to show you, about minerals that are like hair I want a <b>hair</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Tittie's tail.|$|E

6000|$|... "Friday.--I was sleeples all night. I gave {{went to my}} {{feelings}} in the folloring lines--there's a <b>hair</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Balfe's Hopera that she's fond of. I edapted them to that mellady.|$|E
60|$|Slowly {{she stroked}} his <b>hair.</b> Shocked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> himself, he cried, {{and the tears}} hurt in every fibre of his body. Suddenly he stopped, but he dared not lift his face <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the bedclothes.|$|R
6000|$|I was not {{a little}} excited, {{but one of the}} worst fits of restlessness under Lord Erymanth's harangues had come upon Harold. He only sat it out by pulling so many <b>hairs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his beard that they made an audible frizzle in the fire when he brushed them off his knee, and stood up, saying gruffly, [...] "You are very good; he deserves it. But I must get Lucy home in good time. May I go and speak to your coachman? Tracy gave me a message for him." ...|$|R
60|$|The dervishes, {{who could}} not imagine {{what had become of}} him, were enchanted at his reappearance. He told them of the attempt on his life made by his guest of the {{previous}} day, and then retired into his cell. He was soon joined here by the black cat of which the voice had spoken, who came as usual to say good-morning to his master. He took him on his knee and seized the opportunity to pull seven white <b>hairs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his tail, and put them on one side till they were needed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, {{they can}} hear me all over the square. Well, I think he looked well enough for a plain youth, who hadn't taken his <b>hair</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> curl-papers for some time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bo, {{our host}} {{will soon have}} need of his hunting {{abilities}} if your appetite holds," [...] said Helen, {{as she tried to}} keep her <b>hair</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her eyes while she laced her boots.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, 'twas Elizabeth-- [...] Yes, 'twas their girl; [...] Pale was her cheek, and her [...] <b>Hair</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> curl. [...] 'Mother!' {{the loving}} one, [...] Blushing, exclaimed, [...] 'Let not your {{innocent}} [...] Lizzy be blamed.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{should think}} your mother would get you warmer things," [...] began Belle, who found {{something}} rather interesting in the shabby girl, with shy bright eyes, and curly <b>hair</b> bursting <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the old hood.|$|R
