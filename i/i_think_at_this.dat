[...] At another point Boucher said, [...] "It's becoming increasingly clear that very large numbers of civilians were killed by the indiscriminate use of force by Uzbek forces. There needs to be a credible and a transparent accounting to establish the facts of the matter of what occurred in Andijon. At the same time I think {{it is clear that the}} episode began by an armed attack on the prison and on other government facilities. There are reports of hostage-taking and other claims that should be investigated. Nothing justified such acts of violence." [...] Craig Murray, the ambassador of the United Kingdom to Uzbekistan, criticized the US government's position, calling it a [...] "sickening response."

Ashestiel looks worst, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> period of the year; but is a beautiful place in summer, where I passed nine happy years. Did I ever pass unhappy years anywhere?

60|$|Sennacherib {{the son of}} Shalmaneser in the 14th year of Hezekiah invaded Phœnicia, {{and took}} several cities of Judah, and {{attempted}} Egypt; and Sethon or Sevechus King of Egypt and Tirhakah King of Ethiopia coming against him, he lost in one night 185000 men, as some say by a plague, or perhaps by lightning, or a fiery wind which blows sometimes in the neighbouring deserts, or rather by being surprised by Sethon and Tirhakah: for the Egyptians in memory of this action erected a statue to Sethon, holding in his hand a mouse, the Egyptian symbol of destruction. Upon this defeat Sennacherib returned in haste to Nineveh, and [367] his Kingdom became troubled, so that Tobit could not go into Media, the Medes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time revolting: and he was soon after slain by two of his sons who fled into Armenia, and his son Asserhadon succeeded him.

60|$|But, by a just retribution, it {{soon came}} out that Catherine Howard, before her marriage, had been really guilty of such crimes as the King had falsely {{attributed}} to his second wife Anne Boleyn; so, again the dreadful axe made the King a widower, and this Queen passed away as so many in that reign had passed away before her. As an appropriate pursuit under the circumstances, Henry then applied himself to superintending the composition of a religious book called 'A necessary doctrine for any Christian Man.' He {{must have been a}} little confused in his mind, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>at</b> about <b>this</b> period; for he was so false to himself as to be true to some one: that some one being Cranmer, whom the Duke of Norfolk and others of his enemies tried to ruin; but to whom the King was steadfast, and to whom he one night gave his ring, charging him when he should find himself, next day, accused of treason, to show it to the council board. This Cranmer did to the confusion of his enemies. I suppose the King thought he might want him a little longer.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> it was <b>at</b> <b>this</b> {{point that}} the two men began to go to pieces. They were in an excited frame of mind, and this thing {{unmanned}} them. You will no doubt recall Keats's poem about stout Cortez staring with eagle eyes at the Pacific while all his men gazed at each other with a wild surmise, silent upon a peak in Darien. Precisely so did Peter Willard and James Todd stare with eagle eyes at the second lake hole, and gaze at each other with a wild surmise, silent upon a tee in Woodhaven. They had dreamed of such a happening so often and woke to find the vision false, that at first they could not believe that the thing had actually occurred.|$|R
60|$|He {{laid his}} hand on my head as he uttered the last words. He had spoken earnestly, mildly: his look was not, indeed, that of a lover beholding his mistress, but it was that of a pastor recalling his {{wandering}} sheep--or better, of a guardian angel watching the soul for which he is responsible. All men of talent, whether they be men of feeling or not; whether they be zealots, or aspirants, or despots--provided only they be sincere--have their sublime moments, when they subdue and rule. I felt veneration for St. John--veneration so strong that its impetus thrust me at once to the point I had so long shunned. I was tempted to cease struggling with him--to rush down the torrent of his will into the gulf of his existence, and there lose my own. I was almost as hard beset by him now as I had been once before, in a different way, by another. I was a fool both times. To have yielded then would have been an error of principle; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment. So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> hour, when I look back to the crisis through the quiet medium of time: I was unconscious of folly at the instant.|$|E

This, I say, is the woman's snare; but would the ladies once but get above that fear and manage rightly, they would more certainly avoid it by standing their ground, in a case so absolutely necessary to their felicity, that by exposing themselves as they do; and if they did not marry so soon as they may do otherwise, they would make themselves amends by marrying safer. She is always married too soon who gets a bad husband, and she is never married too late who gets a good one; in a word, there is no woman, deformity or lost reputation excepted, but if she manages well, may be married safely one time or other; but if she precipitates herself, it is ten thousand to one but she is undone.|$|E
60|$|It {{is not to}} be {{supposed}} that these little folks were to be permitted by their careful fathers and mothers, uncles, aunts, or grandparents, to stray abroad into the woods and fields, without the guardianship of some particularly grave and elderly person. O no, indeed! In the first sentence of my book, you will recollect that I spoke of a tall youth, standing {{in the midst of the}} children. His name--(and I shall let you know his real name, because he considers it a great honor to have told the stories that are here to be printed)--his name was Eustace Bright. He was a student at Williams College, and had reached, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> period, the venerable age of eighteen--years; so that he felt quite like a grandfather towards Periwinkle, Dandelion, Huckleberry, Squash-blossom, Milkweed, and the rest, who were only half or a third as venerable as he. A trouble in his eyesight (such as many students think it necessary to have, nowadays, in order to prove their diligence at their books) had kept him from college a week or two after the beginning of the term. But, for my part, I have seldom met with a pair of eyes that looked as if they could see farther or better than those of Eustace Bright.|$|E
60|$|The man to {{whom they}} had trusted all their hopes was young for so great a command. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that, <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time, (October, 1861,) General McClellan was not yet thirty-five. He had served, early in life, in the Mexican war, having come {{originally}} from Pennsylvania, and having been educated at the military college at West Point. During our war with Russia {{he was sent to}} the Crimea by his own government, in conjunction with two other officers of the United States army, that they might learn all that was to be learned there as to military tactics, and report especially as to the manner in which fortifications were made and attacked. I have been informed that a very able report was sent in by them to the government on their return, and that this was drawn up by McClellan. But in America a man is not only a soldier, or always a soldier, nor is he always a clergyman if once a clergyman: he takes a spell at anything suitable that may be going. And in this way McClellan was, for some years, engaged on the Central Illinois Railway, and was for a considerable time the head manager of that concern. We all know with what suddenness he rose to the highest command in the army immediately after the defeat at Bull's Run.|$|R

5000|$|Dear Reichsführer, among tens of {{millions}} of Jews in Europe, there are, I figure, at least two to three millions {{of men and women who}} are fit enough to work. Considering the extraordinary difficulties the labour problem presents us with, I hold the view that those two to three millions should be specially selected and preserved. This can, however, only be done if at the same time they are rendered incapable to propagate. About a year ago I reported to you that agents of mine had completed the experiments necessary for this purpose. I would like to recall these facts once more. Sterilization, as normally performed on persons with hereditary diseases, is here out of the question, because it takes too long and is too expensive. Castration by X-ray however is not only relatively cheap, but can also be performed on many thousands in the shortest time. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time it is already irrelevant whether the people in question become aware of having been castrated after some weeks or months, once they feel the effects.
