5|$|Although {{the custom}} had no basis <b>in</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> {{frequently}} resulted in prosecution, {{particularly from the}} mid-19th century onwards, {{the attitude of the}} authorities was equivocal. At least one early 19th-century magistrate is on record as stating that he did not believe he had the right to prevent wife sales, and there were cases of local Poor Law Commissioners forcing husbands to sell their wives, rather than having to maintain the family in workhouses.|$|E

5|$|By 1532, Calvin {{received}} his licentiate <b>in</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> published his first book, {{a commentary on}} Seneca's De Clementia. After uneventful trips to Orléans and his hometown of Noyon, Calvin returned to Paris in October 1533. During this time, tensions rose at the Collège Royal (later to become the Collège de France) between the humanists/reformers and the conservative senior faculty members. One of the reformers, Nicolas Cop, was rector of the university. On 1 November 1533 he devoted his inaugural address {{to the need for}} reform and renewal in the Roman Catholic Church.|$|E
5|$|During his schooldays at Winchester College, {{where many}} of his {{relatives}} had preceded him, he won a scholarship and was also awarded a gold medal for an essay in Latin.

5|$|Advertising {{standards}} laws in many jurisdictions {{prohibit the}} use of the phrase kosher in a product's labelling unless the producer can show that the product conforms to Jewish dietary laws; however, different jurisdictions often define the legal qualifications for conforming to Jewish dietary laws differently.

In several cases, laws restricting {{the use of}} the term kosher have later been determined to be illegal religious interference.|$|E

The latter's death only months after Reitz started working with him, made Reitz decide to continue his studies in London, at the Inner Temple. It was a decision that needed deliberation, as his father was hoping for his son {{to return to the}} farm in due time, and the financial situation of the family was not strong. However, Reitz did go to London, and finished his studies successfully. He was called to the bar at Westminster on 11 June 1867. During his time in England Reitz became interested in politics, and regularly attended sessions of the House of Commons. Before returning to South Africa he made a tour of Europe.|$|E
5|$|Dustan's {{father was}} a shop manager for the Morris Hedstrom chain in Fiji. However, {{from an early age}} Don was educated in Australia, and grew up as part of the Adelaide establishment. He excelled academically before {{experiencing}} his progressive political awakening while training <b>in</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> arts at the University of Adelaide. His upper-class background and scholarly bearing made him unusual for the Labor Party at the time, but he rose quickly and entered parliament at the age of 26. Dunstan quickly achieved prominence as Labor's standout performer, a charismatic and aggressive debater in an era of sedate political conduct. The dominant political figure at the time was Premier Thomas Playford IV, then leading the Liberal and Country League (LCL) through a 27-year hold on power, aided by a system of electoral malapportionment dubbed the Playmander, which gave undue weight to the LCL's rural base since its introduction by the LCL in 1936. Dunstan stridently pursued the LCL over the Playmander.|$|E
5|$|Elections {{are governed}} by the State Electoral Commission and electoral boards. Members of those bodies are {{required}} to have a university degree <b>in</b> <b>law,</b> <b>and</b> {{they may not be}} members of any political party. The State Electoral Commission prepares and manages elections in accordance with legislation, appoints lower-ranking election-commission and board members, issues directives to such bodies and supervises their work. The State Electoral Commission compiles and publishes candidate lists, supervises the legality of political campaigns and compiles and publishes election results. All members of election boards (or their legal deputies) must be present at assigned polling stations at all times while the polling station is open. The board verifies the identity of voters against the list of registered voters and records the turnout. The turnout number is later checked against number of votes cast; if the number of votes exceeds the turnout, the election at that polling station must be repeated. Votes are tallied by hand, and that information is forwarded (along with all other records kept at the polling station) to the State Electoral Commission.|$|E

5|$|Ida {{insisted that}} McKinley {{continue}} his increasingly successful career <b>in</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> politics. He attended the state Republican convention that nominated Hayes {{for a third}} term as governor in 1875, and campaigned again for his old friend in the election that fall. The next year, McKinley undertook a high-profile case defending a group of coal miners arrested for rioting after a clash with strikebreakers. Lynch, McKinley's opponent in the 1871 election, and his partner, William R. Day, were the opposing counsel, and the mine owners included Mark Hanna, a Cleveland businessman. Taking the case pro bono, he was successful in getting {{all but one of}} the miners acquitted. The case raised McKinley's standing among laborers, a crucial part of the Stark County electorate, and also introduced him to Hanna, who would become his strongest backer in years to come.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, {{at the age}} of 18, Chen began {{attending}} school as a grade one student at the Elementary School for the Blind in Linyi city. In 1994, he enrolled at the Qingdao High School for the Blind, where he studied until 1998. He had already begun developing an interest <b>in</b> <b>law,</b> <b>and</b> would often ask his brothers to read legal texts to him. He earned a position at the Nanjing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine in 1998 but because his family was poor, they had to borrow $340 to cover tuition costs. They still fell short of the required $400 and university authorities reportedly had to be pleaded with before allowing Chen to enroll. He studied in Nanjing from 1998 to 2001, specializing in acupuncture and massage—the only programs available to the blind. Chen also audited legal courses, gaining a sufficient understanding of the law to allow him to aid his fellow villagers when they sought his assistance. After graduation he returned to his home region and found a job as a masseur in the hospital of Yinan County.|$|E
