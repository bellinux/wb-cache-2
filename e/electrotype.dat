5|$|Most coin {{collectors}} {{became aware}} of the 1804 dollar in 1842, when Jacob R. Eckfeldt (son of Adam Eckfeldt) and William E. Du Bois published a book entitled A Manual of Gold and Silver Coins of All Nations, Struck Within the Past Century. In the volume, several coins from the Mint's coin cabinet, including an 1804 dollar, were reproduced by tracing a pantograph stylus over an <b>electrotype</b> of the coins. In May 1843, numismatist Matthew A. Stickney was able to obtain an 1804 dollar from the Mint's coin cabinet by trading a rare pre-federal United States gold coin. Due to an increase in the demand for rare coins, Mint officials, including Director Snowden, began minting an increasing number of coin restrikes in the 1850s. Several 1804 dollars were struck, and some were sold for personal profit on the part of Mint officials. When he discovered this, Snowden bought back several of the coins. One such coin, which Snowden later added to the Mint cabinet, was struck over an 1857 shooting thaler and became known as Class II, the only such piece of that type known to exist today. Six pieces with edge lettering applied after striking became known as Class III dollars.|$|E

25|$|In the 19th century, museums often {{displayed}} <b>electrotypes</b> {{of ancient}} coins {{instead of the}} originals (see photograph D below), and individuals purchased <b>electrotypes</b> for their private collections. By 1920, the Victoria and Albert Museum in England had acquired nearly 1000 <b>electrotyped</b> copies of important objects from the collections of other European museums. The most celebrated may be their copy of the Jerningham wine cooler, which is a spectacular silverwork made in England in 1735 {{that has long been}} {{in the collection of the}} Hermitage Museum in Russia. Many of these objects were made by Elkington & Co., which had an extensive business in <b>electrotyped</b> silver.|$|R
25|$|<b>Electrotyping</b> {{is related}} to electroplating, which {{permanently}} adds a thin metallic overlayer to a metallic object instead of creating a freestanding metal part. <b>Electrotyping</b> and electroforming both produce metal parts, but differ in technical details. Electroforming involves {{the production of a}} metallic part around a metallic mandrel, although the term is sometimes used more broadly to encompass all electrodeposition processes. As noted above, <b>electrotyping</b> forms the part using a non-conducting mold or form whose surface has been made conducting by applying a thin coating of graphite or metal powder.|$|R

In 1839, Lenz produced several medallions using <b>electrotyping.</b> Along with the <b>electrotyped</b> relief produced by Jacobi the same year, these were the first instances of galvanoplastic sculpture. Lenz died in Rome, after suffering from a stroke.|$|R

25|$|An {{important}} {{example of}} electrotyping's use for preservation is the <b>electrotype</b> of the plaster life-mask {{of the poet}} John Keats (see photograph E below). The original life mask was made by Haydon in 1816. The plaster mask was electrotyped in 1884 by Elkington & Co., and this copper copy is now apparently in better condition than the plaster original.|$|E
25|$|Electrotyping is {{activated}} by electric currents that flow between anode wires {{that are also}} immersed in the solution and the wire connected to the coated mold (the cathode). For copper electrotyping, a typical aqueous electrolyte contains copper sulfate (CuSO4) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and the anode is also copper; the arrangement is illustrated in the figure. The electric current causes copper atoms to dissolve from the anode's surface and to enter the electrolyte as copper ions (Cu++ in the figure). Copper ions are {{taken up by the}} mold's conducting surface at the same rate at which copper dissolves from the anode, thus completing the electrical circuit. When the copper layer on the mold grows to the desired thickness, the electric current is stopped. The mold and its attached <b>electrotype</b> are removed from the solution, and the <b>electrotype</b> and the mold are separated. An animation of the electrotyping process was produced in 2011 by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Other metals besides copper can be electrotyped; similar procedures apply, but each different metal needs its own anode and electrolyte chemicals.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first three}} Goethe-Schiller monuments in the US were in San Francisco (1901), Cleveland (1907), and Milwaukee (1908). They all {{incorporated}} bronze sculptures cast at the foundry in Lauchhammer, Germany; the original sculpture in Weimar {{is also a}} bronze casting. The statue in Syracuse is not a casting; it consists of thin copper pieces that are joined together. The statue has a small plaque attached to its base that reads [...] "Galvanoplastik-Geislingen St.", which indicates that it {{was made by the}} Abteilung für Galvanoplastik (Galvanoplastic Division) of the WMF Company in Geislingen an der Steige, Germany. Galvanoplastik is a German word encompassing both <b>electrotyping</b> and electroforming. The pieces were fabricated using the <b>electrotyping</b> process, which involves the depositing of copper metal from a solution of chemicals onto the inside of a mold. The process is activated by electrical currents flowing between wires immersed in the solution and a coating on the mold; the coating and the solution both conduct electricity. As in the Syracuse statue, large <b>electrotyped</b> sculptures typically consist of <b>electrotyped</b> copper pieces that are joined together, most likely by soldering. The individual pieces in <b>electrotyped</b> sculptures are a fraction of an inch thick, and one surface conforms very exactly to the details of the mold. The Syracuse sculpture is apparently the only copy of Rietschel's statue that was produced using copper <b>electrotyping,</b> and may be the only public artwork in the United States that was produced by WMF.|$|R

25|$|A slight {{problem with}} {{electrotyping}} of type {{is that the}} new form is slightly smaller than the original - according to Justin Howes, the calculation of the Stephenson Blake type foundry was that the shrinkage was on average 0.0038%. While obviously not very much, this deviance could accumulate if a letterform was repeatedly regenerated. Stephenson Blake's solution was to squash type slightly in a press or file it down to broaden it before putting it into the <b>electrotype</b> bath.|$|E

25|$|<b>Electrotype</b> {{was also}} used to {{manufacture}} matrices {{that could be used}} as moulds for individual pieces of metal type. This had several advantages over traditional punchcutting in hard steel: the type master only needed to be carved out of soft metal, and was also useful for large sizes of type, since it was hard to drive large punches into a matrix effectively. It cut the cost of decorative types that would not be used so often as body text typefaces. On the other hand, it gave no steel punch {{that could be used to}} create multiple matrices quickly, and was reported to not always give such good results as steel punchcutting.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the first}} {{applications}} of electrotyping was in printing. Initially, electrotyping was used to make copper reproductions of engraved metal plates or wooden carvings, which were used to print artwork. The electrotypes could be incorporated along with movable type to compose the s for printing. Jacobi published his first account of electrotyping in October 1838. In 1839, electrotyping was used by Russian printers for government documents; the Russian Czar Nicholas I had immediately become an enthusiastic supporter and patron of the technology. In England, the first use of electrotyping for printing appeared in the London Journal of April 1840, and other English examples are known from later in that year. The image to the right shows {{one of the earliest}} uses of electrotyping in the United States; it is a comparison done by Joseph Alexander Adams in 1841 of the printed image prepared directly from a wood carving and of the image printed from a copper <b>electrotype</b> copy. Electrotyped copper plates could be formed into cylinders, which was valuable for use in magazine and newspaper printing.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Electrotyping</b> (also galvanoplasty) is a {{chemical}} method for forming metal parts that exactly reproduce a model. The method {{was invented by}} Moritz von Jacobi in Russia in 1838, and was immediately adopted for applications in printing and several other fields. As described in an 1890 treatise, <b>electrotyping</b> produces [...] "an exact facsimile of any object having an irregular surface, whether it be an engraved steel- or copper-plate, a wood-cut, or a form of set-up type, {{to be used for}} printing; or a medal, medallion, statue, bust, or even a natural object, for art purposes." [...] In art, several important [...] "bronze" [...] sculptures created in the 19th century are actually <b>electrotyped</b> copper, and not bronze at all; sculptures were executed using <b>electrotyping</b> at least into the 1930s. In printing, <b>electrotyping</b> had become a standard method for producing plates for letterpress printing by the late 1800s. It complemented the older technology of stereotyping, which involved metal casting. By 1901, stereotypers and electrotypers in several countries had formed labor unions around these crafts. The unions persisted into the 1970s, but by the late 20th century, after more than a century in widespread use for preparing plates, the two technologies had been bypassed by the transitions to offset printing and to new techniques for the preparation of printing plates.|$|R
