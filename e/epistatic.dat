25|$|Rugged, <b>epistatic</b> fitness landscapes {{also affect}} the trajectories of evolution. When a {{mutation}} {{has a large}} number of <b>epistatic</b> effects, each accumulated mutation drastically changes the set of available beneficial mutations. Therefore, the evolutionary trajectory followed depends highly on which early mutations were accepted. Thus, repeats of evolution from the same starting point tend to diverge to different local maxima rather than converge on a single global maximum as they would in a smooth, additive landscape.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} genetics, if genes A and B are mutated, {{and each}} mutation by itself produces a unique phenotype {{but the two}} mutations together show the same phenotype as the gene A mutation, then gene A is <b>epistatic</b> and gene B is hypostatic. For example, the gene for total baldness is <b>epistatic</b> to the gene for brown hair. In this sense, epistasis can be contrasted with genetic dominance, which is an interaction between alleles at the same gene locus. As the study of genetics developed, and {{with the advent of}} molecular biology, epistasis started to be studied in relation to Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) and polygenic inheritance.|$|E
25|$|Two {{mutations}} {{are considered}} to be purely additive if the effect of the double mutation is the sum {{of the effects of the}} single mutations. This occurs when genes do not interact with each other, for example by acting through different metabolic pathways. Simple, additive traits were studied early on in the history of genetics, however they are relatively rare, with most genes exhibiting at least some level of <b>epistatic</b> interaction.|$|E
25|$|There are tools on {{the site}} {{for a wide range}} of {{functions}} that range from simple graphical displays of variation in gene expression or other phenotypes, scatter plots of pairs of traits (Pearson or rank order), construction of both simple and complex network graphs, analysis of principal components and synthetic traits, QTL mapping using marker regression, interval mapping, and pair scans for <b>epistatic</b> interactions. Most functions work with up to 100 traits and several functions work with an entire transcriptome.|$|E
25|$|Epistasis {{occurs when}} the {{expression}} of one gene is modified by another gene. For example, gene A only shows its effect when allele B1 (at another Locus) is present, but not if it is absent. This {{is one of the}} ways in which two or more genes may combine to produce a coordinated change in more than one characteristic (for instance, in mimicry). Unlike the supergene, <b>epistatic</b> genes do not need to be closely linked or even on the same chromosome.|$|E
25|$|Epistasis is the {{phenomenon}} where {{the effect of}} one gene (locus) {{is dependent on the}} presence of one or more 'modifier genes', i.e. the genetic background. Originally the term meant that the phenotypic effect of one gene is masked by a different gene (locus). Thus, <b>epistatic</b> mutations have different effects in combination than individually. It was originally a concept from genetics but is now used in biochemistry, computational biology and evolutionary biology. It arises due to interactions, either between genes, or within them, leading to non-linear effects. Epistasis has a large influence on the shape of evolutionary landscapes, which leads to profound consequences for evolution and evolvability of phenotypic traits.|$|E
25|$|Proteins {{are held}} in their {{tertiary}} structure by a distributed, internal network of cooperative interactions (hydrophobic, polar and covalent). <b>Epistatic</b> interactions occur whenever one mutation alters the local environment of another residue (either by directly contacting it, or by inducing changes in the protein structure). For example, in a disulphide bridge, a single cysteine {{has no effect on}} protein stability until a second is present at the correct location at which point the two cysteines form a chemical bond which enhances the stability of the protein. This would be observed as positive epistasis where the double-cysteine variant had a much higher stability than either of the single-cysteine variants. Conversely, when deleterious mutations are introduced, proteins often exhibit mutational robustness whereby as stabilising interactions are destroyed the protein still functions until it reaches some stability threshold at which point further destabilising mutations have large, detrimental effects as the protein can no longer fold. This leads to negative epistasis whereby mutations that have little effect alone have a large, deleterious effect together.|$|E
2500|$|An {{over-riding}} {{theme of}} Allard's lifetime work was {{the demonstration of}} [...] "favorable <b>epistatic</b> combinations of alleles of different loci", or multilocus gene complexes in wild and cultivated plants that were assembled in and adapted to specific habitats. To illustrate this theme his last two papers focused on two in-breeding species (the slender wild oat Avena barbata and barley Hordeum vulgare) and one outcrossing species, corn (Zea maize).|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} end of the spectrum, some white-spotted horses are so {{extensively}} marked that the character of the frame pattern is masked. In particular, the tobiano pattern, a dominant gene, is <b>epistatic</b> to overo. Other white-spotting genes include splashed white or [...] "splash", sabino, and [...] "calico". Any combination, or all, of these white-spotting genes can act together to produce horses with so much white that the presence of frame cannot be determined without a DNA test.|$|E
2500|$|High {{epistasis}} {{is usually}} considered a constraining factor on evolution, {{and improvements in}} a highly <b>epistatic</b> trait are considered to have lower evolvability. This is because, in any given genetic background, very few mutations will be beneficial, even though many mutations may need to occur to eventually improve the trait. The lack of a smooth landscape {{makes it harder for}} evolution to access fitness peaks. In highly rugged landscapes, fitness valleys block access to some genes, and even if ridges exist that allow access, these may be rare or prohibitively long. Moreover, adaptation can move proteins into more precarious or rugged regions of the fitness landscape. These shifting [...] "fitness territories" [...] may act to decelerate evolution and could represent tradeoffs for adaptive traits.|$|E
2500|$|To {{account for}} this, W.E. Castle {{postulated}} {{that there was}} a third allele at the Extension locus: ED or [...] "dominant black". Based on the existence of such conditions in other animals, Castle suggested that the dominant black gene (ED) would override the [...] "points" [...] pattern of dominant Agouti (A) and produce black or near-black horses, which could then go on to have bay offspring. The implication was that the seal brown coat color, which is often quite nearly black, could be produced by this allele., extends the dark pigment so much that it actually masks the effect of the bay pattern gene, A. He called this the gene for dominant black and described the color as jet black, which does not fade in sunlight as the ordinary black may do. The foal coat is also thought to be black, whereas the first coat of the recessive black is often more of a mouse gray color. The existence of a similar gene in other mammals helped lead him to this conclusion. Thus, ED is thought to extend the dark color even if A or at is present (that is, ED is <b>epistatic</b> to A and at). A jet black could be ED_aa or ED_A_ or ED_atat or ED_ata, where the blank indicates that the paired gene has no effect. There is no direct evidence that the gene ED exists in the horse." ...|$|E
2500|$|If all {{mutations}} are additive, {{they can}} be acquired in any order and still give a continuous uphill trajectory. The landscape is perfectly smooth, with only one peak (global maximum) and all sequences can evolve uphill to it by the accumulation of beneficial mutations in any order. Conversely, if mutations {{interact with one another}} by epistasis, the fitness landscape becomes rugged as the effect of a mutation depends on the genetic background of other mutations. At its most extreme, interactions are so complex that the fitness is ‘uncorrelated’ with gene sequence and the topology of the landscape is random. This is referred to as a rugged fitness landscape and has profound implications for the evolutionary optimisation of organisms. If mutations are deleterious in one combination but beneficial in another, the fittest genotypes can only be accessed by accumulating mutations in one specific order. This makes it more likely that organisms will get stuck at local maxima in the fitness landscape having acquired mutations in the 'wrong' order. [...] For example, a variant of TEM1 β-lactamase with 5 mutations is able to cleave cefotaxime (a third generation antibiotic). However, of the 120 possible pathways to this 5-mutant variant, only 7% are accessible to evolution as the remainder passed through fitness valleys where the combination of mutations reduces activity. In contrast, changes in environment (and therefore the shape of the fitness landscape) have been shown to provide escape from local maxima. In this example, selection in changing antibiotic environments resulted in a [...] "gateway mutation" [...] which epistatically interacted in a positive manner with other mutations along an evolutionary pathway, effectively crossing a fitness valley. This gateway mutation alleviated the negative <b>epistatic</b> interactions of other individually beneficial mutations, allowing them to better function in concert. Complex environments or selections may therefore bypass local maxima found in models assuming simple positive selection.|$|E
50|$|The frame overo gene can be {{masked by}} other white patterns, {{particularly}} tobiano, {{which is a}} dominant gene and <b>epistatic</b> to overo. <b>Epistatic</b> means that when both genes are present, {{this is the one}} expressed.|$|E

50|$|Classical {{genetics}} considered <b>epistatic</b> {{interactions between}} two genes at a time. It is now evident from molecular genetics that all gene loci {{are involved in}} complex interactions with many other genes (e.g., metabolic pathways may involve scores of genes), and that this creates <b>epistatic</b> interactions that are much {{more complex than the}} classic two-locus models.|$|E

50|$|The {{effects of}} genes are now {{commonly}} quantifiable by assaying {{the magnitude of}} a phenotype (e.g. height, pigmentation or growth rate) or by biochemically assaying protein activity (e.g. binding or catalysis). Increasingly sophisticated computational and evolutionary biology models aim to describe the effects of epistasis on a genome-wide scale {{and the consequences of}} this for evolution. Since identification of <b>epistatic</b> pairs is challenging both computationally and statistically, some studies try to prioritize <b>epistatic</b> pairs.|$|E
50|$|Because the Ino {{mutation}} totally inhibits {{the production}} of normal melanin pigment it prevents the visible expression {{of all the other}} mutations which depend on the presence of melanin to show their effect. This is called epistasis, and Ino is phenotypically <b>epistatic</b> over many other mutations, including Dark, Grey, Opaline, and the Dilute series. It is not <b>epistatic</b> over the Blue mutation, so there are two forms of the albino budgerigar, one in the green series called the Lutino and one in the blue series called the Albino. Both these varieties may be masking many other hypostatic mutations, so the genotype of an Albino or Lutino with respect to these mutations cannot be determined visually. Nor is the Ino mutation <b>epistatic</b> over the Cinnamon mutation — see below.|$|E

50|$|Aaron Rosanoffs {{theory of}} {{personality}} distinguishes seven dimensions (normal, hysteroid, manic, depressive, autistic, paranoid, and epileptoid), {{which can be}} <b>epistatic</b> or hypostatic dimensions, the manifestation of the latter being concealed or inhibited by the former.|$|E
5000|$|Common {{analysis}} methods utilize general linear models to identify heterotic groups, estimate general or specific combining ability, interactions with testing environments and years, or estimates of additive, dominant, and <b>epistatic</b> genetic effects and genetic correlations.|$|E
50|$|In {{classical}} genetics, if genes A and B are mutated, {{and each}} mutation by itself produces a unique phenotype {{but the two}} mutations together show the same phenotype as the gene A mutation, then gene A is <b>epistatic</b> and gene B is hypostatic.

50|$|Outbreeding {{depression}} is the reduced biological fitness in {{the offspring of}} distantly related parents. The decline in fitness due to outbreeding is attributed to a breakup of coadapted gene complexes or favorable <b>epistatic</b> relationships.

5000|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} how information about <b>epistatic</b> interactions relates to gene pathways, let us consider a simple example of vulval cell differentiation in C. elegans. Cells differentiate from Pn cells to Pn.p cells to VP cells to vulval cells. Mutation of lin-26 blocks differentiation of Pn cells to Pn.p cells. Mutants of lin-36 behave similarly, blocking differentiation at the transition to VP cells. In both cases, the resulting phenotype is marked by an absence of vulval cells as there is an upstream block in the differentiation pathway. A double mutant in which both of these genes have been disrupted exhibits an equivalent phenotype that is no worse than either single mutant. The upstream disruption at lin-26 masks the phenotypic effect of a mutation at lin-36 [...] in {{a classic example of}} an alleviating <b>epistatic</b> interaction.|$|E
5000|$|Crow writes, [...] "The current view ... is {{that the}} {{dominance}} hypothesis is the major explanation of inbreeding decline and the high yield of hybrids.

Biosemioticists investigate sign-mediated interactions within and between organisms that underlie syntactic, pragmatic and semantic rules.|$|E
