40|$|Besides the {{existing}} four <b>fundamental</b> interactions there must exist six neutral <b>fundamental</b> interactions (as six {{new forms of}} interaction) {{in accordance with the}} neutrosophy theory. For example, between strong interaction and weak interaction there exists intermediate interaction, namely neutral strong-weak <b>fundamental</b> interaction, it’s neither strong interaction nor weak interaction, but something in between.

50|$|A {{harmonic}} {{sound is}} said to have a missing <b>fundamental,</b> suppressed <b>fundamental,</b> or phantom <b>fundamental</b> when its overtones suggest a <b>fundamental</b> frequency but the sound lacks a component at the <b>fundamental</b> frequency itself.The brain perceives the pitch of a tone not only by its <b>fundamental</b> frequency, but also by the periodicity implied by the relationship between the higher harmonics; we may perceive the same pitch (perhaps with a different timbre) even if the <b>fundamental</b> frequency is missing from a tone.|$|R
40|$|The <b>fundamental</b> {{ontology}} of {{the world}} is given by its <b>fundamental</b> categories.

Following Peter van Inwagen (forthcoming), take divisions between ontologically <b>fundamental</b> categories to mark “real divisions between things. ” These divisions mark out the <b>fundamental</b> categorical structure {{of the world}}: i. e., the structure of the <b>fundamental</b> categories is defined by divisions between <b>fundamental</b> categories. Speaking metaphorically, the <b>fundamental</b> categorical structure of the world carves the world at its <b>fundamental</b> joints.

5|$|Only two {{or three}} frets are needed for the guitarchords—major, minor, and {{dominant}} sevenths—which are emphasized in introductions to guitar-playing and to the <b>fundamentals</b> of music. Each major and minor chord can be played on two successive frets on three successive strings, and therefore each needs only two fingers. Other chords—seconds, fourths, sevenths, and ninths—are played on only three successive frets. For fundamental-chord fingerings, major-thirds tuning's simplicity and consistency are not shared by standard tuning, whose seventh-chord fingering is discussed {{at the end of}} this section.|$|E

5|$|That same year, a {{group of}} liberal ministers {{composed}} a statement defending their theological views known as the Auburn Affirmation {{due to the fact}} that it was based on the work of Robert Hastings Nichols of Auburn Seminary. Citing the Adopting Act of 1729, the Affirmation claimed for the PCUSA a heritage of doctrinal liberty. It also argued that church doctrine could only be established by action of the General Assembly and a majority of presbyteries; therefore, according to the Affirmation, the General Assembly acted unconstitutionally when it required adherence to the five <b>fundamentals.</b>|$|E

5|$|Escoffier also {{simplified}} {{and organized}} the modern menu {{and structure of}} the meal. He published a series of articles in professional journals which outlined the sequence, and he finally published his Livre des menus in 1912. This type of service embraced the service à la russe (serving meals in separate courses on individual plates), which Félix Urbain Dubois had made popular in the 1860s. Escoffier's largest contribution was the publication of Le Guide Culinaire in 1903, which established the <b>fundamentals</b> of French cookery. The book was a collaboration with Philéas Gilbert, E. Fetu, A. Suzanne, B. Reboul, Ch. Dietrich, A. Caillat and others. The significance of this is to illustrate the universal acceptance by multiple high-profile chefs to this new style of cooking.|$|E

However, 2K offered {{them a chance}} to develop a reboot for the Spec Ops series, promising that they would have a lot of creative freedom. Development began in early 2007, with most other <b>fundamentals</b> of the initial game intact. While the game is an installment in the Spec Ops series, the team chose to use new ideas and intentionally avoided using existing elements of the franchise.|$|E

She and her colleagues developed and codified many of the <b>fundamentals</b> of programming while working on the ENIAC, since it was the first computer of its kind. After her work on ENIAC, Bartik went on to work on BINAC and UNIVAC, and spent time at a variety of technical companies as a writer, manager, engineer and programmer.
