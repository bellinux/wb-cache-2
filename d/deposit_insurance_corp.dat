2500|$|In 1995 {{economist}} Robert Whaples {{stated that}} measuring {{the effect of}} the New Deal remains a thorny issue for economists because it is so difficult to measure the effects it had on the country. A survey of academic specialists by Whaples showed that 49% of those economists surveyed felt that the New Deal lengthened and deepened the depression, while 51% disagreed. The same survey also showed that only 5% of professional historians and 27% of professional economists felt the same way. However, economist Eric Rauchway of the University of California stated [...] "very few people disapprove of most of the New Deal reforms", which include Social Security, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal <b>Deposit</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Corp.,</b> and Fannie Mae. Regardless, unemployment peaked in 1932 at 25% and was reduced to 13.9% by 1940.|$|E
2500|$|As a result, late in {{the evening}} on November 23, 2008, Citigroup and Federal {{regulators}} approved a plan to stabilize the company and forestall a further deterioration in the company's value. On November 24, 2008, the U.S. government announced a massive stimulus package for Citigroup designed to rescue the company from bankruptcy while giving the government a major say in its operations. A joint statement by the US Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and the Federal <b>Deposit</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Corp</b> announced: [...] "With these transactions, the U.S. government is taking the actions necessary to strengthen the financial system and protect U.S. taxpayers and the U.S. economy." [...] The arrangement called for the government to back about $306 billion in loans and securities and directly invest about $20 billion in the company. The Treasury provided $20 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds in addition to $25 billion given in October. The Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) agreed to cover 90% of the losses on Citigroup's $335 billion portfolio after Citigroup absorbed the first $29 billion in losses. The Treasury would assume the first $5 billion in losses; the FDIC would absorb the next $10billion; then the Federal Reserve would assume the rest of the risk. The assets remained on Citigroup's balance sheet; the technical term for this arrangement is ring fencing.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how international depositors respond to national <b>deposit</b> <b>insurance</b> policies. Countries with explicit <b>deposit</b> <b>insurance</b> {{are found to}} be relatively attractive to international non-bank depositors. Deposit schemes characterized by coinsurance, a private administration, and a low <b>deposit</b> <b>insurance</b> premium appear to be particularly favored by these depositors. The sensitivity of non-bank <b>deposits</b> to <b>deposit</b> <b>insurance</b> policies opens up the possibility of international regulatory competition in this area. The EU directive on <b>deposit</b> <b>insurance</b> imposes minimum standards on national <b>deposit</b> <b>insurance</b> policies. This directive, however, is silent on several important features of <b>deposit</b> <b>insurance</b> such as the level of the <b>deposit</b> <b>insurance</b> premium.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to improve our {{understanding}} of the costs and benefits of explicit <b>deposit</b> <b>insurance.</b> To this end, we compare the opportunity-cost value of <b>deposit</b> <b>insurance</b> services for a large sample of banks drawn from countries with or without explicit <b>deposit</b> <b>insurance.</b> After correcting for certain bank- and country-specific factors, we find that the existence of explicit <b>deposit</b> <b>insurance</b> raises the opportunity-cost value of <b>deposit</b> <b>insurance,</b> but that the presence of a sound legal system with proper enforcement of rules reduces the adverse effects of explicit <b>deposit</b> <b>insurance</b> on the opportunity-cost value of <b>deposit</b> <b>insurance</b> services. Our findings suggest that moral hazards and other incentive problems created by existing governmental <b>deposit</b> <b>insurance</b> schemes differ in magnitude between different types of banks and among different countries, and that explicit <b>deposit</b> <b>insurance</b> should not be introduced in countries with weak institutional environments...|$|R
