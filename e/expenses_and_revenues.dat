40|$|The poultry {{industry}} has experienced unprecedented efficiencies since 1960 {{in large part}} due to vertical integration facilitated by production contracts between growers and integrators. As growers seek information about contract production {{they need to be}} well informed about all aspects of the process, especially potential income. Recent poultry grower complaints have surfaced as a result of incorrect <b>expense</b> <b>and</b> <b>revenue</b> expectations. The Interactive Broiler Income Spreadsheet (IBIS) is developed to enable current and prospective poultry producers to better estimate income. IBIS, an unbiased Excel spreadsheet tool to assist in decision-making regarding broiler production profitability, uses actual grower <b>expense</b> <b>and</b> <b>revenue</b> information or, alternatively, grower-panel default data to assess income under various grower-specified production, <b>expense,</b> <b>and</b> price scenarios. Poultry integrator grower service personnel, lenders, and Cooperative Extension professionals will utilize IBIS to assist growers in operational planning and risk tolerance identification in varying economic situations. Growers may also gauge effects of capital improvements, equipment upgrades, chick placements, and time between flocks on income. Copyright 2000, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
