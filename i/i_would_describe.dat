[...] <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>describe</b> {{him as a}} very cerebral player, a very unselfish player ... He's {{been one of the}} most effective point guards in America." [...] ESPN's Doug Gottlieb said Scheyer was making an interesting case for national player of the year. [...] On February 15, Scheyer became the first player to win the ACC Player of the Week award three times in the 2009–10 season; it was the fourth time he had won the award in his career. After facing him, North Carolina point guard Larry Drew said: [...] "He's as crafty as you can get. [...] You just don't like playing against players like that. He can shoot the ball well. He's quick enough. He's smart. He knows about angles. He's a good actor. And he can shoot." [...] University of Maryland coach Gary Williams observed: ...|$|E
2500|$|In late June 2003 {{there was}} some public debate in the U.S. {{as to whether the}} {{insurgency}} could be characterized as a guerrilla war. On 17 June, Army Gen. John P. Abizaid said that forces in Iraq were [...] "conducting what <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>describe</b> as a classical guerrilla-type campaign against us. It's low-intensity conflict in our doctrinal terms, but it's war however you describe it." [...] In a statement to Congress on 18 June, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said [...] "There's a guerrilla war there but we can win it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the issue}} of Scottish independence, {{when asked if he}} would {{consider}} himself a unionist, Corbyn said: [...] "No, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>describe</b> myself as a Socialist. I would prefer the UK to stay together, yes, but I recognise the right of people to take the decision on their own autonomy and independence." [...] Corbyn said that he did not favour holding a second Scottish independence referendum, but that it would be wrong for the UK Parliament to block such a referendum if the Scottish Parliament desired to have one.|$|E

5000|$|Though ordained a deacon in the Church of England, MacCulloch {{declined}} ordination to {{the priesthood}} {{because of the}} church's attitude to homosexuality. In 2009 he encapsulated the evolution of his religious beliefs: [...] "I {{was brought up in}} the presence of the Bible, and I remember with affection what it was like to hold a dogmatic position on the statements of Christian belief. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> now <b>describe</b> myself as a candid friend of Christianity." ...|$|R
2500|$|In August 2015, {{when asked}} by Glasgow's Herald {{newspaper}} if he would describe himself as a British unionist, Corbyn replied [...] "No, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>describe</b> myself as a socialist. I would prefer the UK to stay together, yes, but I recognise the right of people to take the decision on their own autonomy and independence". He also criticised the decision by Scottish Labour to work with Conservatives in the Better Together campaign, {{and said that he}} had not actively participated in the referendum campaign. Corbyn also stated his belief that economic inequality exists across the UK, and that Labour should unite people {{on the basis of a}} [...] "radical economic strategy".|$|E
2500|$|All My Children's {{wardrobe}} director, David R. Zyla, {{collaborated with}} Braun {{in creating the}} wardrobe for the Reese Williams character. The two had worked together before when Braun portrayed Carly Corinthos on General Hospital. While bringing their ideas together, they tried {{to make sure they}} did not make Reese into too much of a cliché. [...] "I like that she goes from really strong pants with a buttoned shirt and tie, which is so on trend but is also just great style, to wearing dresses," [...] Braun said. Reese's wardrobe goes {{back and forth between the}} two different types of style which allows Braun and Zyla to play with her fashion. [...] "She's an architect, so to me, I would think she has a real eye for lines," [...] said Braun. [...] "She appreciates form and beauty, and the look we came up with <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>describe</b> as 'streamlined with a flair'." ...|$|E

Not {{necessarily}} a subject, but we had a direction before we wrote it. As you get older it's more interesting to have a theme that everything tries to support – I would say this album [...] has a theme. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>describe</b> it as an attempt at making an adult breakup record. The consequences to what the characters are going through are more significant. There's just more to it. I'm 37 and the world around me is a lot different than when I was writing breakup songs in my 20s. I tried to reflect that in what the lyrics are." [...] Adkins elaborated: [...] "With Damage the point was love songs. But the type of love songs that interest me deal with adversity and emotional injury. If you have a happy song about how happy you are, I just want to slap you. There's no story there for me. I can't have any empathy." ...|$|E

He was a big, bluff, hearty man, this Doctor, and yet I had detected a curious expression in his eyes as he glanced about him--an expression which <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>describe</b> as one of fear, but rather of a man who is alert and on his guard.|$|R

60|$|There was a {{woman from}} the court of Antipas, who {{was a friend of}} Pilate's wife and whom I met at Pilate's the night of my arrival. I shall call her Miriam, for Miriam was the name I loved her by. If it were merely {{difficult}} to describe the charm of women, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>describe</b> Miriam. But how describe emotion in words? The charm of woman is wordless. It is different from perception that culminates in reason, for it arises in sensation and culminates in emotion, which, be it admitted, is nothing else than super-sensation.|$|E

60|$|Were it {{not that}} I am {{somewhat}} closely restricted {{in the number}} of my pages, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>describe</b> at full the merits and beauties of Hetta and Susan Bell. As it is I can but say a few words. At our period of their lives Hetta was nearly one-and-twenty, and Susan was just nineteen. Hetta was a short, plump, demure young woman, with the softest smoothed hair, and the brownest brightest eyes. She was very useful in the house, good at corn cakes, and thought much, particularly in these latter months, of her religious duties. Her sister {{in the privacy of their}} own little room would sometimes twit her with the admiring patience with which she would listen to the lengthened eloquence of Mr. Phineas Beckard, the Baptist minister. Now Mr. Phineas Beckard was a bachelor.|$|E
60|$|The {{somewhat}} dim coal {{fire has}} an essential Influence in producing the effect which <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>describe.</b> It throws its unobtrusive tinge throughout the room, {{with a faint}} ruddiness upon the walls and ceiling, and a reflected gleam upon the polish of the furniture. This warmer light mingles itself with the cold spirituality of the moon-beams, and communicates, as it were, a heart and sensibilities of human tenderness to the forms which fancy summons up. It converts them from snow-images into men and women. Glancing at the looking-glass, we behold--deep within its haunted verge--the smouldering glow of the half-extinguished anthracite, the white moon-beams on the floor, and a repetition of all the gleam and shadow of the picture, with one remove further from the actual, and nearer to the imaginative. Then, at such an hour, and with this scene before him, if a man, sitting all alone, cannot dream strange things, and make them look like truth, he need never try to write romances.|$|E
6000|$|From {{beginning}} to end the [...] "Petrified Man" [...] squib was a string of roaring absurdities, albeit they were told with an unfair pretense of truth that even imposed upon me to some extent, and I was in some danger of believing in my own fraud. But I really {{had no desire to}} deceive anybody, and no expectation of doing it. I depended on the way the petrified man was sitting to explain to the public that he was a swindle. Yet I purposely mixed that up with other things, hoping to make it obscure--and I did. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>describe</b> the position of one foot, and then say his right thumb was against the side of his nose; then talk about his other foot, and presently come back and say the fingers of his right hand were spread apart; then talk about {{the back of his head}} a little, and return and say the left thumb was hooked into the right little finger; then ramble off about something else, and by and by drift back again and remark that the fingers of the left hand were spread like those of the right. But I was too ingenious. I mixed it up rather too much; and so all that description of the attitude, as a key to the humbuggery of the article, was entirely lost, for nobody but me ever discovered and comprehended the peculiar and suggestive position of the petrified man's hands.|$|E

60|$|The {{inclosed}} ode is {{a compliment}} {{to the memory}} of the late Mrs. Oswald of Auchencruive. You probably knew her personally, an honour of which I cannot boast; but I spent my early years in the neighbourhood, and among her servants and tenants. I know that she was detested with the most heartfelt cordiality. However, in the particular part of her conduct which roused my poetic wrath, she was much less blameable. In January last, on my road to Ayrshire, I had put up at Bailie Whigham's, in Sanquhar, the only tolerable inn in the place. The frost was keen, and the grim evening and howling wind were ushering in a night of snow and drift. My horse and I were both much fatigued with the labours of the day, and just as my friend the Bailie and I were bidding defiance to the storm, over a smoking bowl, in wheels the funeral pageantry of the late great Mrs. Oswald, and poor I am forced to brave all the horrors of the tempestuous night, and jade my horse, my young favourite horse, whom I had just christened Pegasus, twelve miles farther on, through the wildest moors and hills of Ayrshire, to New Cumnock, the next inn. The powers of poesy and prose sink under me, when <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>describe</b> what I felt. Suffice it to say, that when a good fire at New Cumnock had so far recovered my frozen sinews, I sat down and wrote the inclosed ode.|$|E
