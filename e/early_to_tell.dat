5|$|Development of the {{sandwich}} began in 2001 {{in response to}} several major factors. After an overall sales decline of 17% coupled with a profit decline of 29%, Burger King {{held a series of}} consumer tests that showed the company's customer base was looking for a wider variety of options when making purchases. Additional survey results revealed that a lack of newer products was discouraging consumers from visiting the chain. Furthermore, the company was seeking to counter the threat to its sales by newer fast casual restaurants that had begun to bite into sales. By July 2002, the chain had sold nearly fifty million of {{the sandwich}}es, eventually displacing the BK Broiler's initial launch figures as the company's best selling product introduction. The successful introduction of the Chicken Whopper {{was one of the few}} noted positive highlights of the company during negotiations for the sale of Burger King by its owner Diageo to a group of investors led by the TPG Capital; Chicago-based consulting firm Technomic Inc. president Ron Paul was quoted that he was encouraged by recent product changes at Burger King such as the new Chicken Whopper, but he said it's too <b>early</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> whether the changes have been successful. Despite the Chicken Whopper's initial success, just over a year after the Chicken Whopper's introduction enthusiasm for the product was waning; Burger King's largest franchisee, Carrols Corporation, was complaining that the product line was a failure, describing the sandwich as a pedestrian product with a great name. As of November 2013, the Chicken Whopper is the current grilled chicken sandwich sold by Burger King in the Middle East.|$|E

500|$|A {{mandatory}} three-day mini-camp {{was held}} in early May. Hines Ward, Aaron Smith and Troy Polamalu attended the camp, but did not fully participate because of injuries. First round draft pick, Rashard Mendenhall was welcomed by Steelers current running back Willie Parker. Parker was [...] "surprised" [...] {{when he heard a}} running back was selected in the first round, but hoped to work with Mendenhall like Jerome Bettis worked with Parker during his rookie season. During the mini-camp, the offense experimented with formations using Parker and Mendenhall in the backfield simultaneously. Receiver Hines Ward took a similar approach to Parker's in welcoming second round draft pick Limas Sweed. As with other receivers in the past, Ward was [...] "very hands-on with Sweed throughout the weekend". Coach Mike Tomlin called the new draft picks [...] "humble", adding that he liked their [...] "spirit and attitude"; however, it was too <b>early</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> how well they will ultimately perform.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the hill}} near {{which he had}} waited to meet Farfrae, almost two years <b>earlier,</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him of the serious illness of his wife Lucetta. The place was unchanged; the same larches sighed the same notes; but Farfrae had another wife--and, as Henchard knew, a better one. He only hoped that Elizabeth-Jane had {{obtained}} a better home than had been hers at the former time.|$|R

2500|$|Steven Weinberg {{rejects the}} {{argument}} about the fine-tuning of the carbon cycle, arguing that [...] "the fine-tuning of the constants of nature here does not seem so fine". He acknowledges that he currently has no explanation (apart from a multiverse) for the smallness of the cosmological constant, but cautions that [...] "It is still too <b>early</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> whether there is some fundamental principle that can explain why the cosmological constant must be this small." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{western allies}} {{maintained}} air superiority {{for much of}} the war and development of new anti-aircraft systems was not as urgent. Nevertheless, by the mid-war period the US Army had reached the same conclusion as their German counterparts; flak was simply no longer useful. Accordingly, in February 1944 the Army Ground Forces sent the Army Service Forces (ASF) a request for information on the possibility of building a [...] "major caliber anti-aircraft rocket torpedo". The ASF concluded that it was simply too <b>early</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> if this was possible, and suggested concentrating on a program of general rocket development instead.|$|E
2500|$|In its {{short life}} the {{article has been}} heavily criticized, both in Turkey and outside. A {{criticism}} heard in Turkey, and also voiced by some outside, {{is that it has}} turned into a tool of the nationalist [...] "old guard", who, so is claimed, use it to press charges against people of international renown, not to stifle dissenting opinions but with the aim of thwarting the admission process to the EU. Novelist Elif Şafak claims the Article has a chilling effect on free expression, notwithstanding its fourth clause. It is too <b>early</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{how this is going to}} be interpreted in cassation (last-instance review) by the Court of Appeals.|$|E
50|$|Stella {{manages to}} save Zoey, but must dive {{underwater}} to do so. When she resurfaces Caleb and Daniel are gone and Sam {{is there with}} Shane, as Stella had messaged him <b>earlier</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him she was going into the forest. She is taken to the hospital, during which time Caleb is discovered. He admits to the murders but also claims {{that they had been}} chased by a monster that killed Daniel. While Shane assures her that there is no monster, Stella still wonders if there is actually a Creeper out there and requests to look at the case files for the other girls that went missing in the town. Shane reluctantly agrees.|$|R
5000|$|The Broncos {{defeated}} Big 12 champion Oklahoma in the Fiesta Bowl as {{only the}} second non-BCS conference school {{to play in a}} BCS bowl, after Utah in 2004. In the 43-42 overtime win, Petersen drew particular attention for his bold play calling {{at the end of the}} game: A 50-yard hook-and-lateral play on 4th-and-18 described as [...] "stunning" [...] for a tying touchdown with just 7 seconds left in regulation, an option pass (off a direct snap to a wide receiver) on 4th-and-2 in overtime, and a [...] "Statue of Liberty" [...] misdirection play for the two-point conversion to win the game in overtime. Petersen stated, [...] "We were trying to get <b>to</b> it <b>earlier,</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you the truth. We needed a play like that to get it over with." ...|$|R

2500|$|At the 2009 Grammy Awards, Nas {{confirmed}} he was collaborating on {{an album}} with reggae singer Damian Marley which {{was expected to}} be released in the fall of 2009. Nas said of the collaboration in an interview [...] "I was a big fan of his father and of course all the children, all the offspring, and Damian, I kind of looked at Damian as a rap guy. His stuff is not really singing, or if he does, it comes off more hard, like on some street shit. I always liked how reggae and hip-hop have always been intertwined and always kind of pushed each other, I always liked the connection. I'd worked with people before from the reggae world but when I worked with Damian, the whole workout was perfect". A portion of the profit was planned to go towards building a school in Africa. He {{went on to say that}} it was [...] "too <b>early</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the title or anything like that". The Los Angeles Times reported that the album would be titled Distant Relatives.|$|E

50|$|Soon {{they arrived}} at Corio Bay which the aboriginals called 'Iramoo' near the present site of Geelong. Because of damaged {{instruments}} they believed they had reached Western Port, the large bay further east which had been discovered by Matthew Flinders and George Bass in 1798. Twenty-two years later, in 1825, James Meehan, who had accompanied John Murray in exploring Port Phillip Bay 18 months <b>earlier,</b> was <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Hume {{that there were no}} large islands in Port Phillip, and that therefore had reached Port Phillip, not Western Port as Hovell had insisted.|$|R

50|$|No {{sources that}} predate the <b>earliest</b> {{references}} <b>to</b> the <b>Tell</b> {{legend of the}} late 15th century refer to a bailiff Gessler in central Switzerland, and it is presumed that no such person existed.

5000|$|Knit the City is a {{group of}} [...] "graffiti {{knitting}} and crochet" [...] street artists founded in London, England in 2009.

This practice has been taken up by groups internationally.|$|R
50|$|Iranian semi-official press first related Rezaeinejad's {{assassination}} to {{the nuclear}} program of Iran but Iran's intelligence minister, Heydar Moslehi, and other officials denied any links between Rezaeinejad and the nuclear program.

5000|$|In 1791, perhaps {{inspired}} by his friend Fox’s delight in rural life, Fitzpatrick purchased Beech Grove in Sunninghill near Windsor.

50|$|In November 2002, Al Ahram Weekly quoted him as {{remarking}} {{with regard}} to the U.S.'s targeted killing of al-Qaeda terrorists in Yemen, It is too <b>early</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> whether this event alone will precipitate a shift toward explicit support of such tactics as employed by Israel on Washington's part.
