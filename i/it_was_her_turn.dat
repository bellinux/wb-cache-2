Other members of this group include Angeline Quinto, Klarisse de Guzman, and Jonalyn Viray. There were speculations that the individual members of the group tried to outshine each other. Amon stated in an interview that ASAP assigned them songs to sing and that the group worked together for the various song numbers. She further clarified that when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>turn</b> she would give her all, but during the time the group merged voices they should blend together.|$|E
25|$|Empress Mentewab was crowned co-ruler {{upon the}} {{succession}} of her son (a first for a woman in Ethiopia) in 1730, and held unprecedented power over government during his reign. Her attempt to continue in this role {{following the death of}} her son 1755 led her into conflict with Wubit (Welete Bersabe), his widow, who believed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>turn</b> to preside at the court of her own son Iyoas. The conflict between these two queens led to Mentewab summoning her Kwaran relatives and their forces to Gondar to support her. Wubit responded by summoning her own Oromo relatives and their considerable forces from Yejju.|$|E
2500|$|Andreyeva {{improved}} to [...] {{to win the}} Soviet title in 1949, but again was ranked second globally behind another Soviet world record breaker, this time Klavdia Tochonova. The 1950 season {{proved to be the}} career-defining one for the 35-year-old Andreyeva. First, she won her fourth and final national title in the shot put. She won her first and only major international gold medal at the 1950 European Athletics Championships, beating Tochonova to the title with a championship record mark of [...] That November <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>turn</b> to improve the world record, and her throw of [...] in Ploiești, Romania, marked {{the first time that a}} woman had thrown beyond fourteen metres. This record lasted until July 1942, when the emergence of Galina Zybina saw the record brought near seventeen metres by the end of the decade. Andreyeva helped establish a pattern of dominance by Soviet women in the shot put, with Tamara Press in the 1960s, Nadezhda Chizhova in the 1970s and Natalya Lisovskaya in the 1980s retaining the record for the Soviets.|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{the death}} of Iyasu II, his son Iyoas took the throne and rivalry {{exploded}} between {{the mother of the}} late Emperor and his widow. Empress Mentewab had been crowned co-ruler when her then underage son had succeeded her husband. [...] Now that her son was gone, she believed that she was entitled to remain as co-ruler. [...] However, Iyasu's widow, Welete Bersabe (known as Wubit) of the Oromo, strongly believed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>turn</b> to take the leading role at the court of her son Iyoas as her mother-in-law had done during the previous reign. [...] The young Emperor took the side of his mother against his grandmother. [...] Empress Mentewab gathered her relatives from her native Qwara and their forces flooded into Gondar to support her claims. [...] When news of the arrival of the Qwaran troops arrived, Welete Bersabe also summoned her relatives from Yejju, and throngs of soldiers arrived from that district to uphold her claims. [...] The city of Gondar was swamped by these two tense armies, and a bloodbath seemed imminent.|$|E

40|$|In {{previous}} work (G. Bonanno, Rational choice and AGM belief revision, Artificial Intelligence, 2009) a semantics for AGM belief revision was proposed based on choice frames, {{borrowed from the}} rational choice literature. In this paper we discuss how to use choice frames to analyze extensive-form games. Given an extensive form with perfect recall, a choice frame {{can be used to}} represent a player 2 ̆ 7 s initial beliefs and her disposition to change those beliefs when she <b>is</b> informed that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>her</b> <b>turn</b> to move. When some players move more than once along some play of the game, the issue of iterated belief revision arises. We provide a semantics for iterated belief revision in terms of choice frames and provide an outline of how to use choice frames to analyze solution concepts for extensive-form games...|$|R

40|$|In [G. Bonanno, Rational {{choice and}} AGM belief revision, Artificial Intelligence, 2009] a {{semantics}} for one-stage AGM belief revision was proposed based on choice frames, {{borrowed from the}} rational choice literature. In this paper we extend the semantics of choice frames to deal with iterated belief revision and use the corresponding structures to analyze extensive-form games. Choice frames {{can be used to}} represent a player's initial beliefs and disposition to change those beliefs when informed that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>her</b> <b>turn</b> to move. If the frame satisfies AGM-consistency and a natural postulate for iterated belief revision, then <b>it</b> <b>is</b> rationalizable by a total pre-order on the set of histories. We show that three properties of this total pre-order, together with the hypothesis of agreement among players, provide a characterization of the notion of consistent assessment, which is the central component of the notion of sequential equilibrium proposed by Kreps and Wilson [Econometrica, 1982]. ...|$|R
