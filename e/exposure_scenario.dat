The required <b>exposure</b> <b>scenarios</b> for substances need to be attached as an annex to the safety data sheet.

40|$|For human, arsenic (As) is toxic {{substance}} which is widely transported from natural and anthropogenic resources into environmental components with consequent risk of transport into food and potable water. Oral intake {{is the most}} significant source of exposure. Toxicity of As is different depending on the form. Risk assessment of human exposure to As results from available databases of food and potable water analyses, which quote only the concentrations of total As. Mean As concentrations in food and potable water in the SR are below the appropriate limits. The maximum limit was exceeded only in maximum levels of edible fats and oils. Comparing As concentrations in individual commodities between the localities in the SR, the highest contents were found in Kosice region. Evaluation of non-carcinogenic risk from oral exposure to As in general population considering the mean <b>exposure</b> <b>scenario</b> did not show risk, because the hazard index was below or only minimally above the value 1. The risk was only found when using the maximal lifelong <b>exposure</b> <b>scenario,</b> which is not probable. Risk assessment of infant exposure to As from human milk showed the hazard index below 1 also for maximal <b>exposure</b> <b>scenario.</b> Carcinogenic risk for present intake of food and potable water was 5. 7 x 10 - 4 for adult population and 2. 8 x 10 - 4 for infants, considering the mean <b>exposure</b> <b>scenario.</b> Using the non-probable maximal <b>exposure</b> <b>scenario,</b> the value of carcinogenic risk for exposure to inorganic As from food and water was 1. 7 x 10 - 2 for adult population. For infants, this value was 4. 5 x 10 - 4 considering the maximal exposure to inorganic As from human milk. The results of total As concentrations in food and potable water in the SR indicate that Slovakia belongs to countries with the lowest mean oral intake of arsenic within Europe. Despite this fact, it is necessary to continue in monitoring of As in environmental components and biological materials with specialisation in determination of inorganic As...|$|E

30|$|A CSR is {{obligatory}} for all registered substances used above 10 tonnes {{per annum}} and if the substance fulfils the criteria for hazards listed in Regulation (EC) No 1272 / 2008 (or PBT or vPvB), then <b>exposure</b> <b>scenarios</b> {{also need to be}} developed. These <b>exposure</b> <b>scenarios</b> describe the processes, operational conditions and RMM for the safe use throughout the whole life cycle for a substance.

30|$|Direct and {{indirect}} effects {{were found in}} both exposure scenarios at environmentally relevant concentrations. In the herbicide <b>exposure</b> <b>scenario</b> with terbutryn, clear direct effects on the aufwuchs community with a LOEC of 0.38  µg L− 1 were found. Effect levels of grazers due to indirect effects were equal, with the overnight drift being the most sensitive grazer endpoint. In the insecticide <b>exposure</b> <b>scenario,</b> clear lethal and sub lethal effects of lambda-cyhalothrin were evident. Derived LC 50 values for the artificial indoor stream and batch experiment were 2.42  µg g− 1  OC (69  days) and 1.2  µg g− 1 OC (28  days), respectively. Sub lethal effects in terms of increased drift as well-reduced growth and triglyceride levels were found at concentrations of 1.4 and 0.09  µg g− 1  OC (LOECs). These results were confirmed by the batch experiment, which revealed effect values in the similar range. Finally, a clear indirect effect of the insecticide on the aufwuchs {{was evident in the}} batch experiment with an LOEC at 0.9  µg g− 1  OC.|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the recipient, {{be it the}} {{formulator}} or the end user, has to check whether he complies with the conditions {{set out in the}} <b>exposure</b> <b>scenario</b> received with the substance. This is especially important in cases downstream users receive a generic <b>exposure</b> <b>scenario</b> and need to decide whether this is sufficient for a specific workplace. With respect to REACH, they are obliged to apply, as a minimum, the conditions of the <b>exposure</b> <b>scenario</b> communicated to them. With respect to worker legislation, downstream users have to identify further workplace-specific conditions and hazards in their risk assessment. It is essential that inadequate exposure scenarios are amended to enhance their value to users of that information. In order to achieve this, recipients need to give feedback to their supplier(s) on the appropriateness of RMM, occupational conditions and process parameters as well as the readability of the eSDS. The quality of the CSR, especially the exposure scenarios, will improve when the knowledge of end users is fully integrated to ensure relevance of this information. For example, do exposure scenarios point to practical and relevant control measures, or do they point to measures that are potentially in conflict with other elements of health and safety legislation? REACH provides two mechanisms to address the appropriateness of exposure scenarios: the option to make details of a downstream use known to the registrant to enable him to prepare appropriate exposure scenarios (articles 37 (2) and (3)) or the option of upstream communication of inappropriate RMM in received exposure scenarios (Article 34).|$|E

30|$|In {{the context}} of REACH, DNELs and DMELs are the {{reference}} values {{that have to be}} compared with the values derived for exposure. Uses of a substance that result in a risk characterisation ratio (RCR - quotient of exposure level and effect level) below 1 are considered to be safe, while RCR[*]>[*] 1 will require additional measures to be prescribed in the <b>exposure</b> <b>scenario</b> in order to define an acceptable risk.|$|E
30|$|The {{instrumentation}} of REACH is differentiated {{and targeted}} to this complex regulatory field. And the waste phase, as shown, is explicitly subject to <b>exposure</b> <b>scenario</b> building, {{which in turn}} is the basic for substance evaluation and the resulting management measures to be derived. However, this is a good starting point for a reduction of the risk cycle problem only on paper, which is not bad, but not sufficient.|$|E
