True in situ processes {{do not involve}} mining or crushing the oil shale. Modified in situ processes involve drilling and fracturing the target oil shale <b>deposit</b> to create voids in the <b>deposit.</b> The voids enable a better flow of gases and fluids through the <b>deposit,</b> thereby increasing the volume {{and quality of the}} shale oil produced.|$|E

5|$|The {{fossil record}} in this member shows the base was {{dominated}} by <b>deposit</b> feeders, while the upper layers were dominated by filter feeders.

5|$|A {{few large}} {{deposits}} produce or produced {{a significant amount}} of the world production. The Bayan Obo iron ore <b>deposit</b> contains significant amounts of bastnäsite and monazite and is, with an estimated 36 million tonnes of rare-earth element oxides, the largest known <b>deposit.</b> The mining operations at the Bayan Obo <b>deposit</b> made China the largest supplier of rare-earth elements in the 1990s. Only 0.2% of the rare-earth element content is europium. The second large source for rare-earth elements between 1965 and its closure in the late 1990s was the Mountain Pass rare earth mine. The bastnäsite mined there is especially rich in the light rare-earth elements (La-Gd, Sc, and Y) and contains only 0.1% of europium. Another large source for rare-earth elements is the loparite found on the Kola peninsula. It contains besides niobium, tantalum and titanium up to 30% rare-earth elements and is the largest source for these elements in Russia.|$|E

40|$|In the Luna {{area of the}} Cantabrian Zone the Cambro-Ordovician Oville and Barrios Formations were studied. Five facies {{groups were}} distinguished, each {{consisting}} {{of one or more}} subfacies. Facies group I represents littoral <b>deposits</b> and consists of four subfacies: barrier-beach <b>deposits,</b> beach <b>deposits</b> surrounded by tidal <b>deposits,</b> sub-beach <b>deposits</b> and littoral-channel fills (rip-current channels). Facies group II represents tidal <b>deposits,</b> consisting of high-energy tidal-channel <b>deposits,</b> low-energy tidal-channel <b>deposits,</b> non-channel tidal <b>deposits</b> and highly wave-influenced tidal <b>deposits.</b> Fluvially influenced <b>deposits</b> form facies group III. Three subfacies were distinguished: fluvial-channel fills, fluvio-tidal <b>deposits</b> and fluvial-overbank <b>deposits.</b> Shelf, pro-delta and delta-slope <b>deposits</b> form facies group IV, four subfacies are found: pro-delta <b>deposits,</b> lower delta-slope <b>deposits,</b> upper delta-slope <b>deposits</b> and shelf <b>deposits.</b> The subfacies of this group form sequential units: delta-slope sequences, shelf sequences or combined shelf and delta-slope sequences, all of which are regressive. Facies group V represents lagoonal <b>deposits.</b> The Oville Formation can be subdivided into four members, the Barrios Formation into seven members. The Oville and Barrios Formations together consist of four large sequences. Sequence I, in which the Griotte Member of the underlying Lancara Formation is included, begins with <b>deposits</b> of a carbonate-clay shelf environment, followed by argillaceous mottled shelf <b>deposits.</b> The top of the sequence consists mainly of littoral <b>deposits.</b> The sequence represents a linear prograding coastline. Sequence II consists of a lower part formed by pro-delta and delta-slope <b>deposits</b> and an upper part formed by tidal delta-top <b>deposits.</b> It represents a high-destructive tide-dominated delta. Part of the area was not influenced by the delta, here a tide-controlled prograding coastline existed. Sequence III begins with a thin transgressive sandstone sheet, which is followed in part of the area by tidal-delta <b>deposits.</b> After the transgression a regressive sequence was formed: tidal-delta <b>deposits,</b> littoral <b>deposits</b> (barrier-bar complex), tidal-flat <b>deposits</b> and fluvial or fluvio-tidal <b>deposits.</b> In part of the area the latter two are absent. The sequence represents a high-destructive wave- and tide-controlled delta, which was bordered on both sides by a coastal plain, consisting of beach ridges. Sequence III was followed by a period of subaerial exposure. Sequence IV begins in some sections with lagoonal <b>deposits,</b> which are overlain by barrier-bar <b>deposits.</b> Fluvial channels are locally found {{in the top of the}} sequence. Sequence IV possesses only small lateral continuity and is absent or extremely thin in the larger part of the area. Sequence IV represents a high-destructive wave-dominated delta, bordered on both sides by emerged areas of non-deposition...|$|R

Forty renal biopsy specimens from 24 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus were examined in detail to assess the amount, character, and distribution of <b>deposits</b> in the glomeruli. Semiquantitative electron microscopic and immunohistologic methods were used. The results were correlated with clinical and histological findings. <b>Deposits</b> were not randomly distributed. Rather, there was some relationship between increasing amounts of subendothelial and mesangial <b>deposits.</b> Subendothelial <b>deposits</b> were found only in active disease and were extensive only {{in the presence of}} extensive mesangial <b>deposits.</b> Contrary to expectation, there was an inverse relationship between the extent of subendothelial and subepithelial <b>deposits.</b> Extensive subendothelial <b>deposits</b> were found only with the most active histological changes and three of four patients with extensive subendothelial <b>deposits</b> died within weeks. Subendothelial <b>deposits</b> contained a wide variety of plasma proteins including, not only the immune globulins and β 1 C globulin, but also fibrinogen, albumin, and transferrin. In general, the clinical course of patients with extensive subepithelial <b>deposits</b> and intramembranous <b>deposits</b> was benign.
