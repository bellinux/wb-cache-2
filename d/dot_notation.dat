25|$|The idea of {{covalent}} bonding {{can be traced}} several years before 1919 to Gilbert N. Lewis, who in 1916 described the sharing of electron pairs between atoms.

Pairs of electrons located between atoms represent covalent bonds. Multiple pairs represent multiple bonds, such as double bonds and triple bonds.

2500|$|The {{total amount}} of energy {{transferred}} as heat is conventionally written as Q (from Quantity) for algebraic purposes.

Heat transfer rate, or heat flow per unit time, is denoted by [...] This {{should not be confused}} with a time derivative of a function of state (which can also be written with the <b>dot</b> <b>notation)</b> since heat is not a function of state.

2500|$|The {{distinction}} between a function and its value becomes important, for instance, when one wishes {{to talk about the}} duality between a function and its argument. [...] In these situations, it is desirable to show the symmetry between function and argument and place the function and the argument on an equal footing. One way to do so is to use bracket notation: we write [...] for the expression f(x). [...] As examples, we can combine the bracket notation with the <b>dot</b> <b>notation</b> (discussed below) in the expression [...] to represent the mapping (an example of a functional) [...] for a given, fixed , without having to introduce the letter f, which is merely a placeholder ("dummy"). [...] Although this notation might allow for cleaner expression of abstract mappings, applying it toward functions containing rational or polynomial expressions is awkward and unwieldy. Thus, this notation is seldom used in general mathematical or scientific settings. (For a related notation used in quantum mechanics, see bra-ket notation.) ...|$|E

40|$|John Byrt's article ‘Elements of rhythmic {{inequality}} in the arias of Alessandro Scarlatti and Handel’ (Early Music, xxxv/ 4 (2007), pp. 609 – 26) presents a welcome and long overdue {{discussion of a}} recurrent rhythmic/stylistic issue facing performers of this repertory. The autograph cantata manuscripts of Alessandro Scarlatti give extra insight into the subject (the most substantial collections of extant autograph cantata manuscripts by Alessandro Scarlatti are those held in Münster, Santini Collection, dated 1701 / 2 (Ms. 3987) and in Yale, dated 1704 – 5 (Osborn Shelves Music 2)). Most of these are works for solo voice and basso continuo—providing a somewhat different perspective from that given by Byrt's study of operatic arias, but one which leads inescapably to a similar conclusion: it seems certain that Scarlatti assumed singers, but not instrumentalists, would read undotted semiquavers as unequal in some contexts, without being prompted by <b>dotted</b> <b>notation...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{time value}} of some notes could change {{according}} to their immediate context in certain situations. The rules for this were developed {{on the basis of}} the typical rhythmic nature of medieval music in the 13th century. Most of this music followed the same basic metric pattern, which in modern notation would be written as a swift [...] (or [...] ) meter. Thus, melodies consisted mainly of ternary long notes (in modern <b>notation,</b> <b>dotted</b> minims), or alternating sequences of binary long notes and short notes (minims and crotchets), or groups of three short notes. In the 13th century, all of these were notated using only the longa and breve notes. A longa was automatically understood to fill a whole ternary metric group whenever it was in the neighborhood of other notes that did the same, i.e., whenever it was followed either by another longa or by a full group of three breves. When, however, the longa was preceded or followed by a single breve, then both filled a ternary group together. Thus, the longa had to be reduced to a value of two (it was [...] "imperfected"). When, finally, there were only two breves in between two longae, then the two breves had to fill up a metrical group together. This was done by lengthening the second breve (brevis altera) to a value of two, while the first (brevis recta) kept its normal value.|$|R
