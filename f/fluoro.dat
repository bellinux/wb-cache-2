25|$|The {{story of}} pantoprazole's {{discovery}} {{is a good}} example of the stepwise development of PPIs. The main focus of modification of timoprazole was the benzimidazole part of its structure. Addition of a trifluoromethyl group to the benzimidazole moiety led to a series of very active compounds with varying solution-stability. In general <b>fluoro</b> substituents were found to block metabolism at the point where they were attached. Later the more balanced fluoroalkoxy substituent, instead of the highly lipophilic and strongly electron-withdrawing trifluoromethyl substituent, led to highly active compounds with supposed longer half-lives and higher solution stability.|$|E
25|$|The UV {{intensity}} is specified for each lamp {{at a distance}} of 1 meter. UV {{intensity is}} inversely proportional to the square of the distance so it decreases at longer distances. Alternatively, it rapidly increases at distances shorter than 1m. In the above formula the UV intensity must always be adjusted for distance unless the UV dose is calculated at exactly 1m from the lamp. Also, to ensure effectiveness the UV dose must be calculated at the end of lamp life (EOL is specified in number of hours when the lamp is expected to reach 80% of its initial UV output) and at the furthest distance from the lamp {{on the periphery of the}} target area. In some applications coating is applied to the lamp to make it shatterproof. The coating is <b>Fluoro</b> Ethylene Polymer which completely encapsulates the lamp and contains the shards and mercury in case of accidental breakage. The coating decreases the UV intensity up to 20%.|$|E
25|$|A new kit was {{introduced}} for the 2008 AFC Champions League due to AFC rules requiring kits to have player {{numbers on the}} front of the uniform as well as the back, which would not fit well with the 'V' on the Victory's regular kit. For the 2009–10 season, Melbourne changed their away shirt to be a reverse of their home shirt; white with a blue chevron. In 2010, Melbourne wore the TAC 'seatbelt' shirt against Perth Glory in a charity event to raise awareness for the necessary use of seat belts in cars. Adidas were announced as the club's official kit manufacturer for five years beginning in the 2011-12 season, after the initial deal for Reebok to supply all A-League clubs had expired. The new kits were announced via the club's YouTube channel, and featured a controversial change to a <b>fluoro</b> yellow away shirt. For their 2013–14 kits, Melbourne Victory received backlash from supporters, as the away kits featured a much lighter blue, bearing a large resemblance to fierce rivals Sydney FC.|$|E
500|$|Among the halide and pseudohalide {{complexes}}, <b>fluoro</b> complexes of iron(III) are {{the most}} stable, with the colorless 2− being the most stable in aqueous solution. Chloro complexes are less stable and favor tetrahedral coordination as in −; finally, − and − reduce themselves easily to iron(II). Thiocyanate is a common test {{for the presence of}} iron(III) as it forms the blood-red 2+. Like manganese(II), most iron(III) complexes are high-spin, the exceptions being those with ligands that are high in the spectrochemical series such as cyanide. An example of a low-spin iron(III) complex is 3−. The cyanide ligands may easily be detached in 3−, and hence this complex is poisonous, unlike the iron(II) complex 4− found in Prussian blue, which does not release hydrogen cyanide except when dilute acids are added. Iron shows a great variety of electronic spin states, including every possible spin quantum number value for a d-block element from 0 (diamagnetic) to [...] (5 unpaired electrons). This value is always half the number of unpaired electrons. Complexes with zero to two unpaired electrons are considered low-spin and those with four or five are considered high-spin.|$|E

5000|$|Oakenfold {{continues}} with {{the style of}} progressive trance and Goa trance styles had first explored six years earlier on Goa Mix (1994). As with Goa Mix, samples of Lisa Gerrard's vocals and snatches of dialogue from the Blade Runner soundtrack are dropped into the mix (notably Roy Batty's final speech), which is used between the last two tracks on the first disc. As with another of his other mix albums, Perfecto <b>Fluoro</b> (1996), snatches of dialogue from other films are present as they form part of the tracks used. For example, the dialogue sample he inserted into Tatonie's [...] "Music" [...] is from the film Contact (1997).|$|E

50|$|The {{diameter}} of the polyaniline nanofibers can be controlled with this method through choice of acid. Hydrochloric acid produces nanofibers with a {{diameter of}} about 30 nm, while camphorsulfonic acid and perchloric acid produce a diameter of 50 nm and 120 nm respectively. Under normal synthetic methods polyaniline derivatives, such as ones that are alkyl and <b>fluoro</b> substituted, do not exhibit a well-defined fibrous shape, however, {{in the presence of}} an aniline oligomer nanofibers of certain derivatives can be synthesized. While the most common oxidant is ammonium peroxydisulfate (APS), various others can be used. One study shows the use of potassium biiodate (KH(IO3)2) as an oxidant, claiming it to lead to polyaniline nanofibers that are longer, have higher crystallinity, and have higher electrical conductivity.|$|E
5000|$|Musically, {{the album}} was a return to his [...] "epic" [...] {{progressive}} trance style that he had popularised on his acclaimed mix albums Goa Mix (1994) and Perfecto <b>Fluoro</b> (1996). Like those albums, film dialogue appears, and also features a tribute to Goa Mix via a remixed version of that album's [...] "Point Zero" [...] by Li Kwan. Creamfields also produced several remixes made for the album, and an original song also made exclusively for the album, [...] "I Found U" [...] by Interstate, which was released as a successful single. The album received positive reviews from critics and was subsequently nominated for [...] "Best Electronic/Dance Album" [...] at the 2005 Grammy Awards. The album also reached the top 50 of the UK Compilation Chart.|$|E
5000|$|In many ways, Creamfields {{marked a}} return to the [...] "epic" [...] trance style Oakenfold had popularised in the 1990s on mixes such as Goa Mix (1994) and Perfecto <b>Fluoro</b> (1996). The opening track is Li Kwan's [...] "Point Zero", albeit in a remixed form known as [...] "Point Zero 2004", is a nod to Goa Mix, which {{features}} the same track as its third track. The second song on the album, [...] "I Found U" [...] by the production duo of music producer Mike Burns and Mark Lewis known as Interstate, was later released as a single and made a big impact among fans, reaching number one in several countries. The song was written for the album and had not previously been released. The pace is slightly increased with Duran & Aytek’s [...] "First Sight", which has Balearic influences. The [...] "typically uplifting elements of trance" [...] are brought into the mix with [...] "Clear Blue" [...] from Markus Schulz presents Elevation, whose beat has been described as [...] "infectious". Paul Oakenfold's mix of Carlos Vives's [...] "Como Tu" [...] was described as [...] "delicious combination of worldbeat chant and dancefloor drama," [...] and [...] "truly symphonic in feel. Fundamentally trance in sound, it’s structured in a very progressive way. The subtle nuances of this track would be lost in a big arena but emphasised in a small club." [...] By the appearance of [...] "12" [...] by Tilt, the mix reaches strong progressive trance territory with a slightly darker twist. Like the aforementioned Goa Mix and Perfecto <b>Fluoro,</b> film dialogue also appears the album, here in the shape of Quivver's [...] "Space Manoeuvres", which contains samples of speech from the 1998 movie Dark City.|$|E
