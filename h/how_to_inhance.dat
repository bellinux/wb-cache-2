40|$|Abstract — In {{controlled}} switching technology, {{an effective}} way to reduce transients produced by switching action, equipment failure preventions, and <b>to</b> <b>inhance</b> power quality, that is, already defined controlled strategies are to close and/or open each independent circuit breaker pole. Controlled switching of high voltage AC gas circuit breaker (GCB) and explains the controlled switching methods that are existing now a days is presented in this paper. Also the paper discusses the merits of controlled switching technology with an application. The accurate prediction of the operating time, subject to the various affecting parameters at that instant. Consistency of CB open and closing time is decides the success of CSS and reliability of CSW device to operate in high voltage environment system. The work presented in the paper focuses on suitability check of the circuit breaker for controlled switching application from mechanical scatter point of view and finds the mechanical scatter window. The allowed circuit breaker scatter for various controlled switching application is discussed in the paper...|$|R

Due to adverse effects of opoids, multimodal analgesia with smaller doses of opoids, local anaesthatics and NSAIDS is given. The aim of postoperative pain relief is to provide subjective comfort and to blunt the autonomic and somatic responces <b>to</b> pain <b>to</b> <b>inhance</b> restore normal function. so that patient can go home early. Methods: 30 Patients each of study group (bupivacine) and control group (normal saline) of class 1 and class 2 of American society of anaesthiology of either sex were taken. 20 cc of bupivacine or normal saline sprayed in gall blader fossa. Vital parameter visual analog scale score and blood sugar was noted. Results: The two groups were comparable regarding age, sex and body mass index. VAS score was significantly reduced in study group. Mean blood sugar showed {{no significant difference in}} two groups. Conclusions: Intraperitonial instillation of bupivacine is safe and reduces pain in early postoperative period. [Int J Res Med Sci 2016; 4 (8. 000) : 3188 - 3190...|$|R
40|$|High density data {{recording}} {{has traditionally been}} an essential factor {{in the development of}} communication and transmission systems. However, recently more sophisticated applications, including video recording, have necessitated refinements of this technology. This study concentrates on the signal processing techniques used <b>to</b> <b>inhance</b> the packing density of stored data. A comparison of the spectral mapping characteristics of different codes illustrates that the need for equalization can be eliminated and that significant bandwidth reduction can be achieved. Secondly, consideration is given to the deleterious effects of flutter, its associated effects on high density {{data recording}}, and the constraints imposed on the development of a time base corrector. An analysis is made of the bandlimiting effect which results when the incoming data is convolved with the head impulse response. The bandwidth of the channel, the size of the head gap, and the velocity of the media are seen from this analysis to be intrinsically related. These signal processing techniques are implemented, the channel capacity computed, and a significant channel efficiency achieved...|$|R

Japan and Philipines made the C. racemosa as one of the aquaculture commodities. C. racemosa culturing has not been done in Indonesia. Usually people just take directly from nature thus diminishing its presence in nature. Seaweed farming important to be done <b>to</b> <b>inhance</b> the production of seaweed. This study was conducted in May - July 2011 in a wet lab, University of Diponegoro Marine Station Teluk Awur, Jepara. The research method used an experimental method with a completely randomized design. This study used four treatments and one control, each of which was repeated three times. Rearing media using sea water plus nitrogen with different concentrations, namely: A (0 μM), B (50 μM), C (100 μM), D (150 μM) and E (200 μM). The results showed that the addition of urea nitrogen was significant difference on the growth of C. racemosa var. uvifera (p < 0. 01). The average of weight gain of C. racemosa var. uvifera for 42 days, as follows: A = 3. 38 ± 0. 089 g, B = 3. 46 ± 0. 14 g; C = 3. 59 ± 0. 18 g; D = 3. 44 ± 0. 11 g and E = 3. 42 ± 0. 10 g. Specific growth rate of C. racemosa var. uvifera generated during the study, namely: A 0. 60 ± 0. 015 % per day; B of 0. 94 ± 0. 012 % per day; C of 1. 36 ± 0. 024 % per day; D of 0. 84 ± 0. 026 % per day and E of 0. 75 ± 0. 028 % per day.
