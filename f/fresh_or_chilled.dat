40|$|AbstractAs {{foreign markets}} {{tend to be}} more diverse and competitive, export {{performance}} of fisheries exporting sector has been gaining increasing attention by policy makers, business managers and marketing researchers. Consequently, the aim of this paper is the investigation of export performance and competitiveness in fisheries sector among Balkan and Eastern European countries. Using Eurostat data, the export trade is described for each country, regarding exports of fisheries products in the market of EU - 27. In specific, Greece presents a significant export trade in <b>fresh</b> <b>or</b> <b>chilled</b> Gilt-head sea bream, while Bulgaria in frozen sprats and snails (live, fresh, chilled, frozen, salted dried with or no shell). Czech Republic exports mainly live carp, while Hungary portrays a significant export trade in live freshwater fish. Finally, Poland shows a significant export trade in smoked fillets of pacific salmon, while Slovenia in <b>fresh</b> <b>or</b> <b>chilled</b> fillets of freshwater fish. The estimated Revealed Competitive Advantage (RCA) indices reveal a wide range of competitiveness among the countries examined. Therefore, {{the results of this study}} could help policy makers to probably reallocate the natural resources, reinforcing the national production activities in those species and potentially to develop a national strategic plan for the export marketing of the fisheries products involved...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} 15 years, embryo {{transfer}} (ET) {{has become increasingly}} widespread within the sport-horse breeding industry. At present, however, the vast majority (> 95 %) of horse embryos are transferred <b>fresh</b> <b>or</b> after <b>chilled</b> storage for up to 24 h, whereas cryopreservation is rarely employed despite its obvious potential for simplifying recipient mare management and facilitating long-term storage and international transport of embryos. A number of inter-related factors {{have contributed to the}} slow development and implementation of equine embryo cryopreservation, these include; 1) the absence of commercially-available products for reliably stimulating superovulation; 2) very poor pregnancy rates following cryopreservation of embryos > 300 mm in diameter; 3) difficulty in recovering embryos at early developmental stages amenable to cryopreservation; and 4) inter-embryo variation in susceptibility to cryodamage. However, acceptable success rates (> 55 % pregnancy) have been reported for both slow-frozen and vitrified small embryos (< 300 mm), and there is renewed interest in cryopreservation, not only in the context of standard ET programmes, but also because it would facilitate pre-implantation genetic testing and allow wider access to techniques for producing embryos in vitro, such as intra 2 cytoplasmic sperm injection and nuclear transfer. This article will review the current status of equine embryo cryopreservation. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Sheep {{production}} in Botswana {{is not a}} very popular enterprise compared to cattle and goats production while dairy production is an emerging animal agriculture. This paper discusses constraints to mutton and dairy production and reviews the importation of mutton, milk and milk products over twelve years (1990 - 2001) into Botswana to meet the huge deficit in supply. Detailed mutton, milk and milk products import data were obtained from Trade Statistics Unit in Gaborone Botswana. Mutton import are from the Republic of South Africa (RSA), Lesotho, Zimbabwe and Namibia while milk and milk products are mainly from the Republic of South Africa. The bulk of mutton import was from RSA in the form of <b>fresh</b> <b>or</b> <b>chilled</b> carcasses and half carcasses. Botswana imported 27732 Kg of mutton in 1990 worth 209, 050 South African Rands (6. 0 R= 1 US$). The mutton importation increased drastically to 777, 164 Kg (2802. 41 %) in 2001 worth 4, 896, 273 Rands (2342. 15 %). Total import of fresh milk was 7. 2 million litres in 2003. This paper suggests possible methods to enhance mutton and milk production locally and reduce the net import of mutton and milk products.

In 2011, 4, 000 t of plaice was landed into UK ports, with a first-sale value of £ 5. 1 million (2). In 2012, UK consumption of all plaice products was 1, 900 t with a value of £ 22 million (3). This equates to around 6, 000 t of whole fish or around 6 % of world consumption. Plaice is purchased <b>fresh,</b> <b>chilled</b> <b>or</b> frozen and obtained from the UK and other European countries such as Holland {{as well as from}} Iceland. Plaice is not suitable for aquaculture, giving relatively poor returns on investment.

These two concepts are conflated in traditional market analysis methods. Third, we applied this new method to the data assembled in the first stage. The estimation results reveal that while there have been extraordinary profit opportunities available in a few niche markets, these are generally highly competitive, well-integrated markets. The Pacific Rim is effectively a single market for pork producers today. Intermarket transfer costs are often substantial, with tariffs especially important, so further trade liberalization to reduce tariffs should further exports by and the competitiveness of U.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of sperm cryopreservation and the maturation state of the oocyte on the time course of canine gamete interaction during co-culture for periods of 1 – 10 h. Semen samples were obtained by digital stimulation and ejaculates processed as fresh, chilled and frozen samples. Sperm were co-cultured with immature or in vitro mature bitch oocytes for up to 10 h. At hourly intervals, oocytes were evaluated for sperm penetration with epifluorescence microscopy. The results were analyzed statistically using generalized linear models. Spermatozoa treatments had a significant effect on the total percentage of oocyte penetration for both types of oocytes; fresh spermatozoa showed the highest average penetration rate, while frozen sperm showed the lowest value (p < 0. 05). At the 1 st hour of co-culture, chilled and frozen dog sperm had a higher penetration percentage (p < 0. 05) of in vitro matured canine oocytes (43. 6 % and 45. 7 %, respectively) than the fresh sperm had (33. 8 %). Sperm penetration was directly proportional to the time of incubation, when <b>fresh</b> <b>or</b> <b>chilled</b> sperm were used (P < 0. 05); in contrast, frozen dog sperm did not change penetration rates with either immature or in vitro matured oocytes over time. Therewas a significant difference in the average of penetration rate between immature (47. 3 %) and in vitro matured oocytes (56. 6 %) throughout the 10 h of culturing; irrespective of sperm treatment. The optimal incubation time in terms of maximizing penetration rates probably are dependent on how spermatozoa were processed prior to fertilization.

40|$|Large {{competition}} from the foreign agriculture forced the Polish farmers to associate themselves in producer groups. The experiences of many countries leading {{in the development of}} the agrarian sector of economy show that one of the important ways to achieve competitive advantage of a farm, which will guarantee it a firm position on the market, is group cooperation. Functioning in a group, allows its members (the farmers), not only to take part in the production of goods, but also in the ensuing stages on their processing and turnover. In the following article depicted is the horizontal integration status of agricultural holdings of Pomerania Region. The article also discusses the quantitative development of the agriculture producer groups, their spatial system and breakdown due to chosen legal form and business structure. In the Pomeranian 48 farm producer groups arose the after integration with the European Union. Most of them, was localized in regions of intensive agriculture with high quality of agricultural producing space. The legal form most commonly chosen when creating a group was a limited liability company (74, 5 %). In business structure the first place was taken by groups producing grain and oilseeds (54, 1 %), the second place simultaneously the producers of poultry, animals and swine, milk and potatoes, <b>fresh</b> <b>or</b> <b>chilled</b> (8, 3 % respectively after). Should hope that this group organization form springing from the authentic rural cooperatives will help to solve if not all, then at least some of the problems facing Pomeranian agriculture. Moreover, a group of agricultural producers will have an influence on the further development of rural areas of Pomerania.
