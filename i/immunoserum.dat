40|$|This immunocytochemical study {{evaluates the}} {{presence}} of IgG 1 – 4, IgA and IgE immunoglobulins in active lesions of 25 localized cutaneous leishmaniasis patients from three bioclimatic areas (Awa, Afa and Bsha) in Mérida State, Venezuela. All immunoglobulin isotypes except IgE were detected, with variable intensity, {{in one or more}} of the epidermal or dermal components of skin lesions. IgG 1 and IgG 2 were detected significantly more frequently than IgG 3, IgG 4 and IgA. The ranking of the isotypes according to frequency of detection was the same in all areas: IgG 1 = IgG 2 > IgG 3 = IgG 4 = IgA, but considered as whole, all isotypes were detected significantly more frequently in patients from the Awa area than in those from the Bsha area. The predominant expression of isotypes IgG 1 and IgG 2 suggests a preferential Th 1 like immune response. Anti-Leishmania <b>immunoserum</b> stained only parasites and their debris, suggesting that most of the immunostaining was nonspecific...|$|E
40|$|Membrane-associated {{lipoxygenase}} {{from green}} tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L. cv Caruso) fruit has been purified 49 -fold {{to a specific}} activity of 8. 3 μmol·min− 1 ·mg− 1 of protein by solubilization of microsomal membranes with Triton X- 100, followed by anion- exchange and size-exclusion chromatography. The apparent molecular mass of the enzyme {{was estimated to be}} 97 and 102 kD by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and size-exclusion chromatography, respectively. The purified membrane lipoxygenase preparation consisted of a single major band following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which cross-reacts with <b>immunoserum</b> raised against soluble soybean lipoxygenase 1. It has a pH optimum of 6. 5, an apparent Km of 6. 2 μm, and Vmax of 103. μmol·min− 1 ·mg− 1 of protein with linoleic acid as substrate. Corresponding values for the partially purified soluble lipoxygenase from tomato are 3. 8 μm and 1. 3 μmol·min− 1 ·mg− 1 of protein, respectively. Thus, the membrane-associated enzyme is kinetically distinguishable from its soluble counterpart. Sucrose density gradient fractionation of the isolated membranes indicated that the membrane-associated lipoxygenase sediments with thylakoids. A lipoxygenase band with a corresponding apparent mol wt of 97, 000 was identified immunologically in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-resolved proteins of purified thylakoids prepared from intact chloroplasts isolated from tomato leaves and fruit...|$|E
40|$|Two {{homeobox}} genes, prdl-a and prdl-b, {{which were}} isolated from a Hydra vulgaris cDNA library, encode paired-like class homeodomains highly {{related to that}} of the aristaless-related genes. In adult polyps, prdl-b is a marker for synchronously dividing nematoblasts while prdl-a displays an expression restricted to the the nerve cell lineage of the head region. During budding and apical regeneration, an early and transient prdl-a expression was observed in endodermal cells of the stump {{at a time when the}} head organizer is established. When apical regeneration was delayed upon concomittant budding, prdl-a expression was found to be altered in the stump. Furthermore, a specific anti-prdl-a protein <b>immunoserum</b> revealed that prdl-a was overexpressed in adult polyps of the Chlorohydra viridissima multiheaded mutant, with an expression domain extending below the tentacle ring towards the body column. Accordingly, prdl-a DNA-binding activity was enhanced in nuclear extracts from this mutant. These results suggest that prdl-a responds to apical forming signals and might thus be involved in apical specification. When a marine hydrozoan (Podocorynae carnea) was used, the anti-prdl-a antibody showed cross-reactivity with cells located around the oral region, indicating that prdl-a function is shared by other cnidaria. The ancestral role for prdl-a-related genes in the molecular definition of the head (or oral-surrounding region) is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Recombinant DNA {{technology}} {{provides a}} powerful tool to create new products in many different fields. Agriculture and the agro-food industry are two of them. Genetic engineering aims at improving the yield, the nutritional quality or the technological value of food crops. The composition of foods may also be modified in order to decrease the content of toxic substances sometimes present in certain food crops. The expression of recombinant proteins in foods must be carefully assessed as proteins may induce allergic reactions in humans. Currently, the potential allergenicity of a protein can be reasonably assessed only when the protein is known to trigger an immune response in sensitive subjects. By contrast, the potential allergenicity of a protein of unknown allergenicity cannot be easily predicted as no <b>immunoserum</b> of allergic subjects is available. That is why an allergenicity assessment model for any genetically engineered food should be designed. Even though the gene product is completely characterised in the transgenic product, this does not necessarily provide information on its potential allergenicity. Animal models, in vitro tests and protein structure {{should be taken into}} account. Besides, allergenicity is a biosafety issue, for it deals with human health. The issue of food allergies in food safety should not be neglected, as an allergic reaction can be life threatening...|$|E
40|$|Anxiety {{is a key}} {{symptom of}} the cocaine {{withdrawal}} syndrome in human addicts, and it {{is considered to be}} one of the major factors in precipitating relapse to chronic cocaine abuse. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of anxiety and depression, and it may also be involved in the acute behavioral and neuroendocrine actions of cocaine. The role of endogenous CRF in cocaine withdrawal-induced anxiety was investigated in the present study. Animals were subjected to chronic cocaine (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, once a day for 14 days) administration. Rats tested 30 min after the last cocaine injection did not show withdrawal anxiety on the elevated plus maze or any alterations in brain CRF levels. Withdrawal (48 h) from chronic cocaine administration produced an intense anxiety-like behavior characterized by decreased open arm exploration. Immunoreactive CRF (CRF-LI) levels were selectively altered in the hypothalamus, in the amygdala and in the basal forebrain structures at the time of the behavioral anxiety, reflecting an increased activity of brain CRF systems. Daily intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.) pretreatment with an <b>immunoserum</b> raised against CRF completely prevented the development of anxiety induced by cocaine withdrawal. These data suggest that extrahypothalamic-limbic CRF hypersecretion may be involved in the development of anxiety related to cocaine withdrawal and that the CRF system may be a useful target for new pharmacotherapies for cocaine withdrawal and relapse...|$|E
40|$|The {{interactive}} {{effects of an}} aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist and of a xenoestrogen on biomarker responses were studied in the liver of male mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). Hepatic 7 -ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) enzymatic activity was measured as a biomarker {{of exposure to the}} model AhR agonist beta-naphthoflavone (bNF). Hepatic proteins indicating the exposure of males to the synthetic oestrogen 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE 2) were monitored by Western blot analysis using <b>immunoserum</b> prepared for this study. After a semi-static exposure only to waterborne EE 2, Western blot analysis of liver homogenate revealed the induction of two protein bands (a double band at 205 [*]kDa and a single band at 125 [*]kDa). The interaction between bNF and EE 2 was investigated by analysing, on the one hand, EROD activity and, on the other hand, immunoreactivity corresponding to the two oestrogen-dependent protein bands in the liver of fish exposed to different concentrations of bNF for 2 days, then to the same concentrations of bNF plus 0. 1 [*]µg[*]l− 1 EE 2 for 5 days. EE 2 changed neither the basal activity of EROD nor its rate of induction with 1. 0 and 4. 0 [*]µg[*]l− 1 bNF. On the other hand, the induction of oestrogen-dependent proteins with 0. 1 [*]µg[*]l− 1 EE 2 was inhibited by exposure to 4. 0 [*]µg[*]l− 1 bNF. These results together with literature data suggest that field monitoring of xenoestrogen contamination through the analysis of oestrogen-dependent protein in male fish as a biomarker should take into account the possible negative interference of AhR agonists...|$|E
