40|$|The {{psychological}} {{boundaries that}} people cognitively establish are analyzed {{in this paper}} as influencing perceptions and thinking about national boundaries. The boundaries concept in psychology refers to how people establish different groups that they use in their thinking. Fuzzy set logic {{is presented as a}} useful technique in representing individual difference in establishing psychological boundaries. Boundaries are explained as a useful analytic concept that effectively encompasses relationality. Social identify theory is explained as significant in revising boundaries as ICT empowers people. The development of Web 1. 0, 2. 0, and 3. 0 is producing more sophisticated messaging, networking, and in the future more heuristic Internet. As ICT messages with more media richness, the influences to change how boundaries are cognitized is increasing. Several cognitive mechanism are identified as causing definition of psychological boundaries. First, the paper discusses how the vast amounts of information available on the Internet is adequate to allow redefining boundaries. Second, strong <b>group</b> <b>identifiers</b> and weak <b>group</b> <b>identifiers</b> are discussed as influencing emerging boundaries.

40|$|In {{two studies}} we {{investigated}} how group variability influences {{the degree to}} which in-group bias is expressed by high and low <b>group</b> <b>identifiers.</b> <b>Group</b> members were provided with group variability and group status feedback in a minimal (Study 1) and in a natural group setting (Study 2). Results show that in low-status <b>groups</b> high <b>identifiers</b> displayed increased in-group bias under conditions of in-group heterogeneity (Study 1) or both in-group and out-group heterogeneity (Study 2). We argued that these conditions undermined clear-cut status differences between the groups on the central comparison dimension, helping to justify in-group bias for those committed to the group. Support was also found for the prediction that high-status groups would display in-group bias when groups were homogeneous and that this effect would be more pronounced for high identifiers (Study 2). Study 2 provided evidence that these effects were mediated by the perceived legitimacy to discriminate the in-group from the out-group, (C) 2000 Academic Press...|$|R

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that group {{identification}} and emotional fit with the group are strongly tied to each other: the emotions of high <b>group</b> <b>identifiers</b> are more {{closely linked to the}} groupâ€™s emotions than the emotions of low <b>group</b> <b>identifiers</b> (e. g., Tanghe, Wisse, & van der Flier, 2010; Totterdell, Kellett, Teuchmann, & Briner, 1998; Totterdell, 2000). Whereas previous research has focused mainly on default, positive experiences within groups, we propose that the link between group identification and emotional fit with the group may depend on the valence of the situation in which the emotions take place. More specifically, we will argue that the positive relationship between group identification and emotional fit with the group may be attenuated or even reversed when group members are faced with a negative situation. In such a situation, high <b>group</b> <b>identifiers</b> may have a more positive outlook and thus react in a more positive way as compared to the other members of their group. In the current research, we investigated the link between group identification and emotional fit with the group, both in reaction to a positive and a negative event. More specifically, in 85 teams (N = 789) of a large Belgian non-profit organization, we examined the association between team identification and emotional fit with the team in response to two vignettes, describing either a positive situation or a negative situation at work. In response to a positive situation at work, the relationship between team identification and emotional fit with the team was positive, replicating earlier research. However, in response to a negative situation at work, the relationship between team identification and emotional fit with the team was negative. Thus, in a negative situation, high team identifiers showed less emotional fit with the team as compared to low team identifiers. Our research thus suggests {{that it is important to}} take into account the context when studying the link between group identification and emotional fit, and that it may not always be beneficial to show emotional fit with the group. status: publishe...|$|R

Unicast address assignments by a local Internet registry for IPv6 have at least a 64-bit routing prefix, yielding the smallest subnet size available in IPv6 (also 64 bits). With such an assignment it is possible to embed the unicast address prefix into the IPv6 multicast address format, while still providing a 32-bit block, the least significant bits of the address, or approximately 4.2 billion multicast <b>group</b> <b>identifiers.</b> Thus each user of an IPv6 subnet automatically has available a set of globally routable source-specific multicast groups for multicast applications.|$|R
