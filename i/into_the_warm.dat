5|$|In {{the first}} few days of September 2002, an upper-level trough emerged in the Gulf of Mexico and stalled. Thunderstorms {{developed}} along the trough and concentrated around a weak low pressure system. Gradually, the trough and associated low pressure drifted south <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> waters of the Gulf of Mexico. A low pressure area in the northwest Gulf of Mexico became the dominant circulation and slowly developed persistent convection near the center. On September 5, a reconnaissance aircraft investigated the system. During the flight, a low-level center became evident and some deep convection persisted; as a result, it was classified as a tropical depression. Wind shear within the Gulf of Mexico was weak and remained favorable to tropical cyclone formation. A reconnaissance flight later that day discovered an ill-defined circulation which led to low confidence of the location of the center of circulation. However, enough convection persisted for the depression to be upgraded into Tropical Storm Fay that evening.|$|E

5|$|The Perfect Storm {{originated}} from a cold front that exited {{the east coast}} of the United States. On October 28, the front spawned an extratropical low to the east of Nova Scotia. Around that time, a ridge extended from the Appalachian Mountains northeastward to Greenland, with a strong high pressure center over eastern Canada. The blocking ridge forced the extratropical low to track toward the southeast and later to the west. Hurricane Grace was swept aloft by its cold front <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> conveyor belt circulation of the deep cyclone on October 29. The cyclone significantly strengthened {{as a result of the}} temperature contrast between the cold air to the northwest and the warmth and humidity from the remnants of Hurricane Grace. The low pressure system continued deepening as it drifted toward the United States. It had an unusual retrograde motion for a nor'easter, beginning a set of meteorological circumstances that occur only once every 50 to 100 years. Most nor'easters affect New England from the southwest.|$|E
5|$|While {{traversing}} {{the southern}} Yucatán Peninsula, the system nearly degenerated into a remnant low {{during the afternoon}} of June18; however, as it neared water, sufficient convection redeveloped to maintain {{the system as a}} tropical depression. The circulation contracted over land and emerged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> waters of the Bay of Campeche that day. The system became increasingly organized as it turned westward in response to a mid-level ridge over the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. A Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance mission into the depression during the afternoon of June19 revealed gale-force winds, prompting the NHC to upgrade and name the system Tropical Storm Barry. Based on a reconnaissance flight and Dvorak estimates, it was estimated that Barry attained peak winds of 75km/h (45mph) late on June19. At 1115UTC on June20, Barry made landfall at Laguna La Mancha, just north of Veracruz, Mexico. Hours after moving inland, Barry weakened to a tropical depression as it interacted with the high terrain of Mexico. The center of circulation became increasingly ill defined, with the majority of convection located well away from the center. Late on June20, Barry dissipated over the Mexican state of Puebla.|$|E

25|$|Tropical Storm Hermine was a near-hurricane {{strength}} {{tropical cyclone}} that brought widespread flooding from Guatemala northwards to Oklahoma in early September2010. Though {{it was named}} in the western Gulf of Mexico, Hermine developed directly from the remnant low-pressure area associated with the short-lived Tropical Depression Eleven-E in the East Pacific. Together the two designated systems caused 52direct deaths and roughly US$740million in damage to crops and infrastructure, primarily in Guatemala. The precursor tropical depression formed on September3 in the Gulf of Tehuantepec and neared tropical storm intensity before making landfall near Salina Cruz, Mexico the next day. Though the depression quickly weakened to a remnant low, the disturbance crossed the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and tracked north <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> waters of the Gulf of Mexico, where it reorganized into a tropical cyclone once again on September5. There, it quickly strengthened into a tropical storm before moving ashore near Matamoros, Mexico on September7 as a high-end tropical storm.

500|$|From 1953 to 1967, O'Hara had a {{relationship}} with Enrique Parra, a wealthy Mexican politician and banker. She met him at a restaurant during a trip to Mexico in 1951. O'Hara stated that Parra [...] "saved me from the darkness of an abusive marriage and brought me back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> light of life again.

[...] As her relationship with Parra progressed, she began to learn Spanish and even enrolled her daughter in a Mexican school. She moved in 1953 to a smaller property at 10677 Somma Way in Bel Air, amid frequent visits to Mexico City, where she and Parra were very well-known celebrities. She hired a detective to follow Parra in Mexico and found that he was being fully honest about the relationship with his ex-wife and that she could trust him. John Ford intensely disliked Parra, and it affected her relationship with Ford in the 1950s as he often interfered in her affairs and frowned upon the demise of her marriage to Price, being a devout Catholic like O'Hara. Price also continued to harass O'Hara for dating Parra and filed a case against her on 20 June 1955, seeking custody of Bronwyn and accusing her of immorality. O'Hara filed a countersuit, charging him with contempt of court for refusing to pay $50 a month in child support and a $7 a month alimony. During the publicity stage of The Long Gray Line in 1955, Ford insulted O'Hara and her brother Charles when he remarked to Charles, [...] "if that whore sister of yours can pull herself away from that Mexican long enough to do a little publicity for us, the film might have a chance at some decent returns".|$|E
