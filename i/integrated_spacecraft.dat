40|$|Students at the University of Colorado Springs (UCCS) and the United States Air Force Academy are designing, {{building}} and testing a spacecraft scheduled to fly on a Lockheed Martin Atlas/Centaur in October, 1997. The mission {{objective is to}} characterize the Global Positioning system (GPS) signal for use in orbit determination above the GPS constellation. An important step in this program is validating the design and functionality of the <b>integrated</b> <b>spacecraft</b> to reduce risk and ensure mission success. This leads to a dilemma balancing verification requirements and cost constraints. Students and faculty on the Falcon Gold team found a reasonable solution to this dilemma. They performed a complete end-to-end test of the <b>integrated</b> <b>spacecraft</b> by attaching it to a high altitude balloon. The balloon carried the spacecraft to an altitude of 105, 000 feet. This paper discusses the 2 ̆ 2 near-space 2 ̆ 2 balloon flight conducted on 20 April, 1997. It briefly outlines the Falcon Gold mission and spacecraft design, details the procedures for accomplishing this type of balloon flight, lists the equipment required and presents the flight results. We also discuss problems encountered, solutions to those problems, and plans for future balloon flight tests of spacecraft prototypes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – This paper {{presents}} {{a simple but}} powerful Real Options Valuation methodology suitable for valuing flexibility in complex engineered systems. It is based on value-at-risk analysis and relies on a standard discounted cash flow approach. It demonstrates the method with {{a case study of}} the architecting of flexible fleets of satellites. The architecting framework <b>integrates</b> <b>spacecraft</b> engineering design with economic analysis to maximize the financial value of a fleet to the operator under realistically uncertain, evolving market conditions. The investigation considers possible evolutions of the forecast demand for a satellite service in two distant geographical markets simultaneously. It defines flexible fleets that significantly improve various aspects of the value-at-risk distributions compared to those of a traditional, rigid fleet architecture. It shows that the flexible architectures can capture more revenue, mitigate more risk and/or reduce overall required investment. The suggested Real Options “in ” the system, rather than “on ” the system, approach allows engineers, strategists, or decision makers in engineering establishments to embed flexibility in the design of complex systems so they can maximize total lifetime project value...|$|R

The Systems Test and Operations Language (STOL), the Huntsville Operations Support Center (HOSC) Scripting Language Processor (SLP), and the Spacecraft Control Language (SCL) offer script-commands that wrap tedious operations tasks into single calls. Since script-commands are interpreted, they also offer {{a certain amount of}} hands-on control that is highly valued in space ground operations. Although compiled programs seem to be unsuited for interactive user control and are more complex to develop, Marshall Space flight Center (MSFC) has developed a product called the Enhanced and Redesign Scripting (ERS) that makes use of the graphical and logical richness of a programming language while offering the hands-on and ease of control of a scripting language. ERS is currently used by the International Space Station (ISS) Payload Operations Integration Center (POIC) Cadre team members. ERS <b>integrates</b> <b>spacecraft</b> command mnemonics, telemetry measurements, and command and telemetry control procedures into a standard programming language, while making use of Microsoft's Visual Studio for developing Visual Basic (VB) or C# ground operations procedures.
