25|$|In the USSR, {{the power}} supply system of an {{electric}} railroad is {{closely tied to the}} overall power system. Electricity arrives from substations in high-voltage power transmission lines, is converted, and then transmitted over feed and negative booster lines to the contact system and then to the rolling stock. Depending on the equipment in the rolling stock, the power may be supplied over <b>DC</b> <b>systems</b> using single-phase systems at the commercial frequency (50 hertz) or lower (16 2/3 or 25Hz). The <b>DC</b> <b>systems</b> in the USSR had a nominal voltage of 3 kilovolts. In 1956, the Central Committee of the Soviet Union adopted the General Plan for the Electrification of Railroads - after which major rail routes were upgraded.|$|E
25|$|Three-phase {{systems have}} the serious {{disadvantage}} of requiring {{at least two}} separate overhead conductors plus rail return. Locomotives operate at one, two or four constant speeds. Most modern locomotives with variable frequency drives can also do regenerative braking on both AC and <b>DC</b> <b>systems</b> and {{are not limited to}} constant speeds.|$|E
25|$|Because {{electrical}} power {{is equal to}} voltage times current, the relatively low voltages in existing <b>DC</b> <b>systems</b> imply relatively high currents. If the DC power in the contact wire is to be supplied directly to the DC traction motors, minimizing resistive losses requires thick, short supply cables/wires and closely spaced converter stations.|$|E

The service reliability, defined as the probability of fulfilling a task before a specified time, is an important metric {{of the quality of}} <b>DC</b> <b>system.</b> This paper attempts to model and compute the service reliability for the <b>DC</b> <b>system</b> under virus epidemics. Firstly, the <b>DC</b> <b>system</b> architecture is modeled by an undirected graph whose nodes (i. e. computers) have a continuous-state model representing its computational capability. Then a set of epidemic differential equations are formulated and solved to obtain the state dynamics of each node under the virus epidemics. A universal generating function (UGF) based approach is proposed to calculate the service reliability of <b>DC</b> <b>system.</b> Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The sensitivity analysis on the model parameters, the comparison with centralized computing system and the optimization of defense level parameter are also conducted...|$|R

25|$|By the 1890s, {{single and}} poly-phase AC was {{undergoing}} rapid introduction. In the U.S. by 1902, 61% of generating capacity was AC, increasing to 95% in 1917. Despite {{the superiority of}} alternating current for most applications, a few existing <b>DC</b> <b>systems</b> continued to operate for several decades after AC became the standard for new systems.|$|E
25|$|More common were {{high-voltage}} <b>DC</b> <b>systems</b> – usually 1200 V DC, {{introduced in}} 1908 by Indianapolis & Louisville Traction Company for their Dixie Flyer and Hosie Flyer services. In the streets, where high-speed service was not feasible, the cars ran at half speed at 600 V or got a changeover device. A 2400 V DC third-rail system was {{installed on the}} Michigan United Railways's Western Division between Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids in 1915, but was abandoned because of the safety hazard. Even 5000 V DC was tested.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{successful}} installations of Thomas Edison's incandescent lighting systems began in [...] Ontario and Quebec starting in 1882.

However, in 1888 the first permanent installation of a Westinghouse alternating current (AC) system was installed in Cornwall, Ontario.|$|E
2500|$|The {{competition}} between AC and DC {{came to a}} head during the development of the potential of Niagara Falls because AC systems could supply electricity over much longer distances than <b>DC</b> <b>systems.</b> This was enormously important to Canada, which had numerous potential hydroelectric sites in remote locations. In 1897 a transmission system was built from the Batiscan River [...] to Trois-Rivières, Quebec. In 1901 Shawinigan Falls was harnessed, and by 1903 a 50,000 volt power line carried electricity from it to Montreal.|$|E
2500|$|<b>DC</b> <b>systems</b> (especially third-rail systems) {{prevent the}} use of {{low-level}} platforms and are limited to relatively low voltages. The latter can limit the size and speed of trains, and limit the power available to passenger comforts, such as air-conditioning. The low voltage also means that long distance transmission is inefficient and thus frequent transformers are required {{along the length of}} the line. This may be a factor favouring overhead wires and high-voltage AC, even for urban usage. In practice, the top speed of trains on third-rail systems is limited to [...] because above that speed reliable contact between the shoe and the rail cannot be maintained.|$|E

2500|$|Westinghouse's {{interests}} in gas distribution and telephone switching [...] {{led him to}} become interested in the then new field of electrical power distribution in the early 1880s. Electric lighting was a growing business with many companies building outdoor direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) arc lighting based street lighting systems and Thomas Edison launching the first DC electric utility designed to light homes and businesses with his patented incandescent bulb. In 1884 he started developing his own DC domestic lighting system and hired physicist William Stanley to work on it. Westinghouse {{became aware of the}} new European alternating current systems in 1885 when he read about them in the UK technical journal Engineering. AC had the ability to be [...] "stepped up" [...] in voltage by a transformer for distribution long distances and then [...] "stepped down" [...] by a transformer for consumer use allowing large centralized power plants to supply electricity long distance in cities with more disperse populations. This was an advantage over the low voltage <b>DC</b> <b>systems</b> being marketed by Thomas Edison's electric utility which had a limited range due to the low voltages used. Westinghouse saw AC's potential to achieve greater economies of scale as way to build a truly competitive system instead of simply building another barely competitive DC lighting system using patents just different enough to get around the Edison patents.|$|E

The station ran until destroyed by fire in 1890. The station used reciprocating steam engines to turn direct-current generators. Because of the DC distribution, the service area was small, limited by voltage drop in the feeders. The War of Currents eventually resolved in favor of AC distribution and utilization, although some <b>DC</b> <b>systems</b> persisted {{to the end of}} the 20th century. <b>DC</b> <b>systems</b> with a service radius of a mile (kilometer) or so were necessarily smaller, less efficient of fuel consumption, and more labor-intensive to operate than much larger central AC generating stations.|$|E
