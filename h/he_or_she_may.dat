5|$|Feminist economists Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum {{created the}} human {{capabilities}} approach {{as an alternative}} way to assess economic success rooted in the ideas of welfare economics {{and focused on the}} individual's potential to do and be what <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>may</b> choose to value. Unlike traditional economic measures of success, focused on GDP, utility, income, assets or other monetary measures, the capabilities approach focuses on what individuals are able to do. This approach emphasizes processes as well as outcomes, and draws attention to cultural, social and material dynamics of well-being. Martha Nussbaum, expanded on the model with a more complete list of central capabilities including life, health, bodily integrity, thought, and more. In recent years, the capabilities approach has influenced the creation of new models including the UN's Human Development Index (HDI).|$|E

A [...] "technical knock-out" [...] (TKO) is possible as well, and is ruled by the referee, fight doctor, or a fighter's corner if a fighter is unable to safely continue to fight, based upon injuries or being judged unable to effectively defend themselves. Many jurisdictions and sanctioning agencies also have a [...] "three-knockdown rule", in which three knockdowns in a given round result in a TKO. A TKO is considered a knockout in a fighter's record. A [...] "standing eight" [...] count rule may also be in effect. This gives the referee the right {{to step in and}} administer a count of eight to a fighter that <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> feels <b>may</b> be in danger, even if no knockdown has taken place.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{performance}} evaluation of determining production size specifications. A customer who does not find the size specification <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> wants <b>may</b> purchase rather a larger or smaller one, but the purchasing desire decreases as {{the difference between the}} required and the prepared sizes increases. Introducing a generalized quality loss function which reflects how much the purchasing desire changes according to the difference, Park and Kim(1992) formulated a mathematical model for determining the size specifications so as to minimize the expected loss. Afterward the model has been applied to the determination of sizing system for mail order clothing and brassiere (Lee and Choi, 1996; Chun, et. al., 1996). The performance of the size determination method proposed by Park and Kim is evaluated in this paper. Usually the intervals between two successive size specifications are determined to be equal, but the size determi-nation method compares favorably with the equidistance case, and more favorably if the population distribution is more skewed. 1.

50|$|If the {{defendant}} {{happened to be}} on parole from an earlier offense at the time, the act for which <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> was acquitted <b>may</b> also {{be the subject of}} a parole violation hearing, which is not considered to be a criminal trial. Since parolees are usually subject to restrictions not imposed on other citizens, evidence of actions that were not deemed to be criminal by the court may be re-considered by the parole board. This legal board could deem the same evidence to be proof of a parole violation. Most states' parole boards have looser rules of evidence than is found in the courts - for example, hearsay that had been disallowed in court might be considered by a parole board. Finally, like civil trials parole violation hearings are also subject to a lower standard of proof so it is possible for a parolee to be punished by the parole board for criminal actions that <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> was acquitted of in court.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a former}} British colony, Barbados has largely adopted British {{political}} models and follows the Westminster ,or Cabinet, system of government, {{in which the}} executive branch of government is responsible to the legislature. The Prime Minister is appointed by the Governor-General. If the Prime Minister dies, as has happened on three occasions, the Governor-General will appoint a replacement from Parliament to serve the remainder of the five-year term of Parliament. The Prime Minister must also be supported, or at least accepted, by a majority in the House of Assembly. If at any time the Prime Minister loses the [...] "confidence" [...] of the House, he must resign, along with the entire Cabinet. In practice, this usually reduces the Prime Minister's appointment to a formality, as the parliamentary leader of the majority political party or coalition is invariably appointed. If, however, no such majority party or coalition exists, whether due to electoral fragmentation or to party realignments after an election, the Governor-General's role becomes much more important. The Governor-General must endeavour to find a candidate acceptable to a majority in the House; if no such candidate can be found, the Governor-General must dissolve Parliament and call an election prematurely.

40|$|Remote {{usability}} {{testing is}} a key tool for usability professionals. Several remote methods exist and {{it is often difficult}} to choose the appropriate method. Testing lower-fidelity prototypes often present unique problems because they provide minimally aesthetic and minimally interactive partial representations of a final product. This qualitative and experiential pilot study is an attempt to compare a remote synchronous (RS) usability testing method where the moderator and participant are displaced by space, and a remote asynchronous (RA) usability testing method where the moderator and participant are displaced by both time and space. An important byproduct of the comparison is the creation of a low-cost, online asynchronous testing mechanism. The results show that the usability issues and participant experience vary between remote synchronous and asynchronous usability testing. While the remote asynchronous method does not require a test moderator and participants find it more convenient to complete the test whenever <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> chooses, participants <b>may</b> require clarification on tasks and usability issues discovered during the test. Participants are also critical of the remote asynchronous method and sometimes find it difficult to complete an entire session on his or her own time without anyone to guide them.

40|$|Familiar chunks can be {{processed}} highly efficiently, and this automatic process can prohibit the problem solver from developing novel and original ways to creatively solve difficult problems. For this reason, {{the role of}} the reverse process, chunk decomposition (CD), the process by which familiar patterns are broken down into their component elements in order to be regrouped in another meaningful manner, has been generally recognized as part of the creative process. However, previous studies on this issue have mainly focused on the decomposition process of CD (the D-process), while the reorganization process of CD has been greatly neglected or has not been distinctively identified in previous work. In this paper, we argue that the R-process could be equally as important as the D-process for CD. Even if a problem solver manages to decompose a familiar chunk into its elements, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> still <b>may</b> not solve the problem if these elements are not successfully organized in a new and meaningful manner. To investigate whether the cognitive mechanism of the R-process is {{different from that of the}} D-process, we designed an experiment for detecting the effects of chunk tightness, which is regarded as the key factor in CD and which can be experimentally manipulated by the radical-level (loose) and stroke-level (tight) Chinese character CD tasks in the D-process, the R-process, and the more purified organization task (the O-process task) that does not involve the decomposition process. Our results showed that the stroke-level (tight) task was more difficult than the radical-level (loose) task for the D-process. However, for the R-process, the stroke- and radical-level tasks showed no differences in performance. Moreover, for the more purified reorganization task, the O-process task, the radical-level organization and reorganization could be even more difficult than the stroke-level organization and reorganization. This result demonstrated that the cognitive processes underlying chunk decomposition and reorganization are fundamentally different. Therefore, more general concepts such as chunk restructuring that could include both D- and R-processes might be more suitable in accounting for this type of creative insight...|$|R

40|$|The visiBabble system {{responds}} with animations to an infant’s syllable-like productions and records the acoustic-phonetic analysis. The system reinforces production of syllabic utterances associated with later language and cognitive development. We report {{here on the}} development of the visiBabble prototype and field-testing with children at risk for being nonspeaking. BACKGROUND Physical, neurological, oral/motor, and cognitive impairments can all significantly impair speech. A child may not be able to produce a sound when <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> wants to, <b>may</b> produce a limited range of sounds, or may not have learned to associate his or her sounds with meaningful referents [2]. Infant vocalizations are effective predictors of later articulation and language abilities. Research studies emphasize the importance of early speech intervention for children at risk for being non-speaking. They also point out the difficulty of providing sufficient speech practice and feedback for children with such atypical speech patterns through traditional forms of intervention and interaction. The visiBabble system responds to a child’s syllable-like productions with brightly colored animations and records the acoustic-phonetic analysis. The system reinforces the production of syllabic utterances that are associated with later language and cognitive development. As a child interacts with visiBabble, the program collects and analyzes the infant’s utterances so that it can be used as either a toy or clinical tool. The techniques involved with VisiBabble directly reflect best practice i...|$|R
