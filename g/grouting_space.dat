Thus, specialized in situ grouting tests were conducted to determine reasonable hole spacing and other parameters. Considering time variation of the rheological parameters of grout, variation of grouting pressure gradient, and evolution law of the fracture opening, numerical simulations were performed on the diffusion process of cement grouting in the fissures of the rock mass. The distribution of permeability after grouting was obtained {{on the basis of}} analysis results, and the <b>grouting</b> hole <b>spacing</b> was discussed based on the reliability analysis. A probability of optimization along with a finer optimization precision as 0. 1 [*]m could be adopted when compared with the accuracy of 0. 5 [*]m that is commonly used.

40|$|Compensation {{grouting}} is {{a multiple}} injection {{process in which}} large numbers of grout injections are carried out in a designated grouting zone. Each injection alters the in-situ stress state {{at the site of}} neighbouring injections, influencing the grout behaviour as well as the deforma-tion of the surrounding soil. In this study, multiple grout injection tests were performed in the laboratory on clay specimens prepared at different overconsolidation ratios ranging from 1 to 10. Two types of grouting mode for compensation grouting were examined: (a) facture grout-ing by injecting epoxy resin, and (b) compaction grouting by expanding a latex balloon placed inside the soil speci-men. The sequence of multiple injections was also varied by injecting either simultaneously or sequentially with different waiting periods. For highly overconsolidated clay the grout efficiency, defined as the ratio of the volume of heave achieved to the injected grout volume, was close to 1 irrespective of <b>grout</b> <b>spacing</b> and injection sequence. For normally consolidated and lightly overcon-solidated clays the grout efficiency increased when the separation in space and time between the injections was reduced. A better grout efficiency was obtained in com-paction grouting than in fracture grouting. The results from finite element analyses of the laboratory tests show that the magnitude and extent of excess pore pressure reduce when many closely spaced simultaneous injections are performed. A few non-simultaneous injections create large stress concentrations around the injection points, leading to larger soil consolidation...|$|R

50|$|Cleanup of {{contaminated}} groundwater {{tends to be}} very costly. Effective remediation of groundwater is generally very difficult. Contamination of groundwater from surface and subsurface sources can usually be dramatically reduced by correctly centering the casing during construction and filling the casing annulus with an appropriate sealing material. The sealing material (grout) should be placed from immediately above the production zone back to surface, because, {{in the absence of}} a correctly constructed casing seal, contaminated fluid can travel into the well through the casing annulus. Centering devices are important (usually 1 per length of casing or at maximum intervals of 9 m) to ensure that the <b>grouted</b> annular <b>space</b> is of even thickness.Upon the construction of a new test well, it is considered best practice to invest in a complete battery of chemical and biological tests on the well water in question. Point-of-use treatment is available for individual properties and treatment plants are often constructed for municipal water supplies that suffer from contamination. Most of these treatment methods involve the filtration of the contaminants of concern, and additional protection may be garnered by installing well-casing screens only at depths where contamination is not present.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} facing dam is the repair of their structures to prevent the seepage under them. In previous years, many existing dams have been treated by grouting, but {{with varying degrees of}} success. One {{of the major}} reasons for this erratic performance is the unsuitable selection of the grouting materials to reduce the seepage. Grouting is an effective way to strengthen of the permeability of the soil to reduce the seepage. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to focus on the efficiency of current available grouting materials and techniques from construction, environmental and economical point of view. The seepage reduction usually accomplished by either chemical grouting or cementious grouting using ultrafine cement. In addition, the study shows a comparison between grouting materials according to their degree of permeability reduction and cost. The application of seepage reduction is based on the permeation grouting using grout curtain installation. The computer program (SEEP/W) is employed to model a dam rested on sandy soil, using grout curtain to reduce seepage quantity and hydraulic gradient by different grouting materials. This study presents a relationship that takes into account the permeability of the soil, <b>grout</b> curtain <b>spacing</b> and a new performance parameter that can be used to predict the best selection of grouting materials for seepage reduction...|$|R

Analysis of deficient grout in Florida post-tensioned (PT) bridges where severe corrosion developed indicated enhanced sulfate ion concentration, high pore water pH, enhanced moisture and low chloride content. The corrosion wasn’t consistent with the conventional causes of steel corrosion such as bleed water accumulation in <b>grout</b> void <b>spaces,</b> chloride contamination and pore water carbonation. Corrosion development was associated with deficient grout with enhanced sulfate levels.

40|$|AbstractGround Source Heat Pumps (GSHP) are {{economically}} and environmentally advantageous for the {{heating and cooling}} of buildings, provided that the long-term sustainability of the thermal exploitation of the soil is ensured. In particular, {{the performance of a}} closed-loop Borehole Heat Exchanger (BHE) strongly depends on the geometrical and physical properties of its components and on the thermo-hydrogeological properties of the surrounding soil. In this work, we present the results of a series of simulations of a double U-pipe Borehole Heat Exchanger, carried out with the finite-element flow and heat transport modelling software FEFLOW to assess the relative influence of these parameters on the operation of a GSHP. The analysis confirms that the length of the borehole is the main design parameter, but the thermal conductivity of the <b>grout,</b> the pipe <b>spacing,</b> the heat carrier fluid and its flow rate also have an important effect on the energy efficiency of the system. The thermal conductivity of the soil is another fundamental variable in the design of a GSHP, and hence it is better to rely on site-specific data, rather than adopting values from the literature. Although most design methods neglect it, the presence of a subsurface flow results in an enhancement of the performance of the system. Thermal dispersion also enhances the efficiency of the system but, since it has not yet been adequately studied, relying on it is not advised for the design of BHE fields...|$|R

40|$|The U-Plant {{is one of}} {{the five}} major nuclear {{materials}} processing facilities at Hanford and was chosen as a pilot project to develop the modalities for closure of the other four facilities at Hanford {{and the rest of the}} Department of Energy (DOE) complex. The remedy for this facility was determined by a Record of Decision (ROD) pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA). That remedy was to 'Close in Place - Partially Demolished Structure'. The U-Plant facility is identified as the 221 -U Building and is a large, concrete structure nominally 247 m (810 ft) long, 20 M (66 ft) wide and 24 m (77 ft) high with approximately 9 m (30 ft) being below grade level. It is a robust facility with walls ranging from 0. 9 m to 2. 7 m (3 ft to 9 ft) thick. One large room extends the entire length of the building that provides access to 40 sub-grade processing cells containing tanks, piping and other components. The work breakdown was divided into three major deliverables: (1) Tank D- 10 Removal: removal of Tank D- 10, which contained TRU waste; (2) Equipment Disposition: placement of contaminated equipment in the sub-grade cells; and (3) Canyon Grouting: <b>grouting</b> canyon void <b>spaces</b> to the maximum extent practical. A large number of pieces of contaminated equipment (pumps, piping, centrifuges, tanks, etc) from other facilities that had been stored on the canyon operating floor were placed inside of the sub-grade cells as final disposition, grouted and the cell shield plug reinstalled. This action precluded a large volume of waste being transported to another burial site.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} subjects {{related to}} the choice of agrouting method in a jointed hard rock mass. By calculating thetotal sealing time to reach the requested sealing level,different grouting methods could be compared and the mostfavourable chosen. A methodology, to calculate the sealing time for differentgrouting methods in different rock masses has been developed. Five main activities {{are included in the}} methodology; drilling,grouting, waiting, probing and re-grouting, which to differingdegrees contribute to the total sealing time. In addition, anextra activity, post-grouting, is regarded separately, as thepost-grouting time normally is not included in the totalsealing time. Within the different activities, subjects such asrock mass properties, examination of rock mass, groutingtechnique, grout mix and the different waiting times have beenstudied. In practice, the application of the methodology requiresthat the average time and variance for each activity on a fanlevel is expressed. The times for each activity are then addedtogether to achieve the total time for a fan. After which, thetime for each fan is added over the entire tunnel length tocalculate the total sealing time for a tunnel. E. g. for the grouting activity, joints belonging to agrouting fan are randomly selected from a joint aperturedistribution for the appropriate rock mass. For each joint in afan, distributions are calculated for parameters such asinflow, time and grouting volumes as e. g. sealing time andsealing effect. Then a Monte Carlo simulation based on thesedistributions and for each grouting fan is carried out and theaverage grouting time and variance calculated. To test the methodology, numerical calculations for threegrouting methods and in three rock masses have been carriedout. The most favourable grouting method is defined as themethod which fulfils the requirement in the shortest sealingtime. By analysing the result of the numerical calculations, ithas been shown that other activities besides grouting oftenhave a large impact on the total sealing time. To choosebetween pre-grouting and post-grouting is regarded as adecision problem, which is strongly related to other activitiesof the tunnel production cycle. A strong relationship was shownbetween the possibility to seal and the chosen grouting methodand grout mix. A long grouting time is not always equivalent toa good sealing result and the opposite has shown to bepossible. Further, calculations have shown that a correct combinationof hole <b>spacing,</b> <b>grout</b> penetration length and appropriatepumping time is essential for a good sealing result. Inaddition, this thesis has demonstrated a method as to how thiscorrect combination should be chosen in order to achieve anoptimal grouting solution.

30|$|Sealing the {{boreholes}} with {{mixtures of}} bentonitic grout should guarantee either perfect hydraulic insulation (e.g., among aquifers intercepted during the perforation) or good heat exchange between the geothermal probes and the subsoil. The permeability, generally {{on the order}} of 10 − 10  cm/s, and the flow ability of the sealing material during the fresh state of the grout are also important for the hydraulic sealing of the aquifers and for good performances during pumping into the borehole. In this regard, Fleuchaus and Blum (2017) put into evidence that the connection of aquifers by leaky annular <b>space</b> <b>grouting</b> can be the cause of damages to the installation. The use of bentonitic cements, more than pure cements, also ensures elasticity of the sealing structure, avoiding damages due to contractions ascribable to anthropic and natural solicitations. This becomes a crucial factor especially for low-enthalpy geothermal installations placed in areas affected by recurrent freeze–thaw cycles that cause circumferential effective stresses (Anbergen et al. 2014; Erol and Francois 2015). Furthermore, the use of bentonitic cements is beneficial also for installation in intensely urbanized areas (e.g., vibrations due to heavy traffic, subway, etc.) or in geologically and tectonically areas with high vulnerability, which can be frequently subjected to elevated risks (seismic, hydrogeological, etc.) producing continuous mechanical stress on the technological system. Pure bentonite, however, has very poor thermal conductivity [≪[*] 1 W/m K; e.g., Tang et al. (2008); Jobmann and Buntebarth (2009); Kim et al. (2015); Sari (2016)]. This means that its massive utilization in the mixture produces significant reduction of the thermal conductivity and, therefore, of the thermal exchange into the borehole between probes and subsoil. In this regard, some authors have already investigated the possibility to improve the thermal exchange by enhancing the thermal conductivity of the sealing grout in the boreholes by adding components (e.g., quartz, sands, carbon-based components, etc.) at high thermal conductivity in the mixture (Delaleux et al. 2012; Lee et al. 2012; Erol and Francois 2014; Indacoechea-Vega et al. 2015). In these instances, however, the mechanical properties of the obtained grouts were not verified or the experimentally determined thermal conductivity is too high (>[*] 6  W/m K) and far from common values observable on Earth (average thermal conductivity of rocks in the subsurface is 3.2  W/m K; Eppelbaum et al. 2014 and references therein). However, experimentation and production of new materials should always ensure exceptional resistance and flexibility of the grout in the borehole, together with thermal conductivity capable to assure balanced thermal exchange with the subsoil. Indeed, thermal conductivity needs to be maintained at values compatible with those of the surrounding subsurface {{in order to reduce the}} occurrence of thermal short-circuits in the borehole with the consequent loss of performance of the whole low-enthalpy geothermal system. This is even more valid for areas characterized by subsoils with very low thermal conductivity (e.g., 0.3 – 2.3  W/m K for clays, silt, water saturated and dry sands; Eppelbaum et al. 2014 and references therein), which can become the main resistance of the whole exchange system. All these aspects lead to the final consideration that a compromise needs to be found to obtain commercial products characterized by good mechanical and physical properties.|$|R
