25|$|Clarkson's fourth album, All I <b>Ever</b> <b>Wanted,</b> was {{released}} on March 10, 2009. Clarkson continued to co-write her own material, {{but this time she}} returned to a mainstream-oriented sound by reuniting with previous collaborators Dr. Luke, Martin, and DioGuardi, and new collaborators Howard Benson, Claude Kelly, Ryan Tedder, Glen Ballard, Matt Thiessen and Katy Perry in contributing tracks for the album. The release of All I <b>Ever</b> <b>Wanted</b> was met with positive acclaim from music critics for its lighter themes. The album was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 and staying there for two weeks. The album has sold 960,000 copies in the U.S. and garnered Clarkson a nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 52nd Grammy Awards.|$|E

Li thinks that the greatest weapon is a smile and the largest power is love.|$|E

25|$|Clarkson {{began writing}} new {{material}} for the album in November 2009 while touring and finished recording in February 2011. Despite its original intent {{to be released in}} late 2010, the release date of the album was pushed back several times. The record is predominantly a pop rock album, with several music critics noting the predominant R and country influences Clarkson explored in Thankful (2003) and All I <b>Ever</b> <b>Wanted,</b> as well as dance-pop themes which she had recently developed. The album's lyrical content mainly explores themes about heartbreak, vengeance, forgiveness and empowerment through metaphors about Clarkson's relationships around people.|$|E

25|$|Stronger is {{the fifth}} studio album by American singer Kelly Clarkson, {{released}} on October 21, 2011 by RCA Records. The thirteen-song track-list features Clarkson collaborating with various new producers {{as well as with}} Howard Benson, whom she collaborated with on her previous album, All I <b>Ever</b> <b>Wanted</b> (2009). Wanting to stray away sonically from her previous albums, Clarkson's main objective was to record her vocal performances as it is heard in her live sets, and used as little auto-tune processing as possible. The album also marked the first release by Clarkson that did not cause a conflict with RCA; her previous records, most notably My December (2007), were released amidst conflict and controversy.|$|E
25|$|As an X-Man she met Mephisto, Dr. Doom and the Fantastic Four, and the Horde. The X-Men later battled Freedom Force and the Adversary in Dallas, and, in a {{televised}} battle, sacrificed themselves to allow Forge to bind the Adversary; Roma secretly restored them to life, and gave Betsy the Siege Perilous, which they could use if they <b>ever</b> <b>wanted</b> to start new lives. The X-Men moved to the Reavers' Australian Outback base, from where they took on the Brood, Genoshan Magistrates, Mister Sinister and the Goblin Queen, M Squad, Mr. Jip and the Serpent Society, Master Mold and Nimrod, Nanny and the Orphan-Maker, and Zaladane and the Savage Land Mutates. As {{they were about to}} depart the Savage Land, Betsy had a precognitive flash of the Reavers killing the team. To prevent this, she sent them through the Siege Perilous.|$|E
25|$|MythDevelopers {{used this}} {{material}} {{to improve and}} further develop the games. Although their initial focus was on the bug-ridden release version of The Wolf Age, they also worked to update {{the first two games}} to newer operating systems on both Mac and PC, fix bugs, and create unofficial patches to enhance both the games themselves and the mapmaking tools. They also developed their own library, dubbed the Myth Core Library, which provided networking, input routines, and other low-level functions. This enabled MythDevelopers to avoid the necessity of licensing any external libraries, and instead allowed them to develop everything in-house. This was part of their deal with Take-Two, as they couldn't incorporate anything into the games which they would be unable to give Take-Two the rights to should the company ever ask for the source code back; all modifications remained the intellectual property of Take-Two, who were free to use them in a future commercial version of Myth, if they <b>ever</b> <b>wanted</b> to re-release an upgraded version of {{one or more of the}} games, or incorporate the modifications into the development of a new Myth game.|$|E

25|$|After this match, Jericho {{entered a}} rivalry with Goldberg, which {{was fueled by}} Goldberg's refusal to fight Jericho in WCW. During Jericho's first episode of the Highlight Reel, an {{interview}} segment, where Goldberg was the guest, he complained that no-one wanted Goldberg in WWE and continued to insult him in the following weeks. On May 12 on Raw, a mystery assailant attempted to run over Goldberg with a limousine. A week later, Co-Raw General Manager, Stone Cold Steve Austin, interrogated several Raw superstars {{to find out who}} was driving the car. One of the interrogates was Lance Storm, who admitted that he was the assailant. Austin forced Storm into a match with Goldberg, who defeated Storm. After the match, Goldberg forced Storm to admit that Jericho was the superstar who conspired Storm into running him over. On May 26, Goldberg was once again a guest on the Highlight Reel. Jericho expressed jealousy towards Goldberg's success in WCW and felt that since joining WWE, he had achieved everything he had <b>ever</b> <b>wanted</b> in his career and all that was left was to defeat Goldberg and challenged him to a match. At Bad Blood, Goldberg settled the score with Jericho and defeated him.|$|E
25|$|A {{handsome}} young prince {{lives in a}} luxurious castle in France. He has everything he <b>ever</b> <b>wanted,</b> and as a result, he is spoiled, selfish and unkind. One night, his kindness is {{put to the test}} when a beggar woman comes to the castle and asks for shelter from the freezing cold, with a single rose as payment. When he shuns the beggar for her repulsive appearance, she then reveals her true form as a beautiful enchantress. Seeing her beauty and realizing her power, the Prince tries to apologize but she transforms him into a terrifying beast-like creature for his arrogance. She also casts a spell on the entire castle, transforming it into a dark, foreboding place, its lush green grounds into dangerous immortal wolf-infested woods, and the good-natured servants into anthropomorphic household objects to reflect their different personalities. Ashamed of his new appearance, the Beast conceals himself inside his castle with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world, and an enchanted rose that would act as the curse's timer which would bloom until he turns 21. If the Beast could learn to love a woman and earn her love in return before the final petal fell off the rose, the curse would be broken, but if not he would remain a beast forever. The Beast turns to despair as the years pass by, with little hope of achieving this.|$|E

500|$|Despite her {{dissatisfaction with}} the song's release as a single, Clarkson began {{promoting}} it in July 2009, performing it live on the Late Show with David Letterman and other talk shows. In the fall, she performed the song on VH1 Divas and at the American Music Awards. She [...] included [...] "Already Gone" [...] in the encore set of her 2009 All I <b>Ever</b> <b>Wanted</b> Tour. Clarkson has also performed the song in tours after. The song has received much praise from music critics, and is {{regarded as one of}} the highlights of All I <b>Ever</b> <b>Wanted.</b> Critics have praised the song for its expressions of vulnerability, its emotional impact, and its successful use of the ballad form. It peaked at number13 on the Billboard Hot 100, and was certified Platinum in Canada and Gold in Australia.|$|E
500|$|... "Already Gone" [...] was co-written by Clarkson and OneRepublic {{lead singer}} Ryan Tedder. Tedder {{describes}} it as [...] "an emotional, heartbreaking breakup song." [...] Tedder and Clarkson wrote six songs together for inclusion on Clarkson's fourth studio album All I <b>Ever</b> <b>Wanted,</b> and [...] "Already Gone" [...] {{is one of three}} of those that appear on the track list.|$|E
500|$|Soon after {{composing}} [...] "Halo", Tedder {{worked with}} Kelly Clarkson on her fourth studio album, All I <b>Ever</b> <b>Wanted</b> (2009), {{for which they}} wrote [...] "Already Gone" [...] together. When the song came out, critics noted a resemblance to Beyoncé's [...] "Halo". Clarkson, however, initially stated that she was unaware of any similarities between the two songs. She eventually realized their resemblance when she listened to both recordings closely; the similarities are most notable in the backing tracks, which in both cases feature a melancholy piano, loud drums, and handclaps. Clarkson tried to prevent [...] "Already Gone" [...] from being included on All I <b>Ever</b> <b>Wanted,</b> but the decision was out of her hands, as her album was already being printed when I Am... Sasha Fierce came out. She accused Tedder of using the same arrangement on both [...] "Already Gone" [...] and [...] "Halo", and complained that people would, incorrectly, assume she was stealing it from Beyoncé.|$|E
