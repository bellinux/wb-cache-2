2500|$|Pastoralism {{has been}} shown, [...] "based on {{a review of}} many studies, to be between 2 and 10 times more {{productive}} per unit of land than the capital intensive alternatives that have been put forward". However, many of these benefits go unmeasured and are frequently squandered by policies and investments that seek to replace pastoralism with more capital intensive modes of production. They have traditionally suffered from poor understanding, marginalization and exclusion from dialogue. The Pastoralist Knowledge Hub, managed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN serves as a <b>knowledge</b> <b>repository</b> on technical excellence on pastoralism as well as [...] "a neutral forum for exchange and alliance building among pastoralists and stakeholders working on pastoralist issues".|$|E

5000|$|A <b>{{knowledge}}</b> <b>repository</b> {{can take}} many forms to [...] "contain" [...] the knowledge it holds. A customer database is a <b>knowledge</b> <b>repository</b> of customer information and insights - or electronic explicit knowledge. A Library is a <b>knowledge</b> <b>repository</b> of books - physical explicit knowledge. A community of experts is a <b>knowledge</b> <b>repository</b> of tacit knowledge or experience. The nature of the repository only changes to contain/manage the type of knowledge it holds. A repository (as opposed to an archive) is designed to get knowledge out. It should therefore have some rules of structure, classification, taxonomy, record management, etc., to facilitate user engagement.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{interconnect}} multiple <b>knowledge</b> <b>repositories</b> {{within a single}} framework is a key asset for various use cases such as document retrieval and question answering. However, independently created repositories are inherently heterogeneous, reflecting their diverse origins. Thus, {{there is a need}} to align concepts and entities across <b>knowledge</b> <b>repositories.</b> A limitation of prior work is the assumption of high afinity between the repositories at hand, in terms of structure and terminology. The goal of this dissertation is to develop methods for constructing and curating alignments between multi-cultural <b>knowledge</b> <b>repositories.</b> The first contribution is a system, ACROSS, for reducing the terminological gap between repositories. The second contribution is two alignment methods, LILIANA and SESAME, that cope with structural diversity. The third contribution, LAIKA, is an approach to compute alignments between dynamic repositories. Experiments with a suite ofWeb-scale <b>knowledge</b> <b>repositories</b> show high quality alignments. In addition, the application benefits of LILIANA and SESAME are demonstrated by use cases in search and exploration...|$|R
40|$|This {{abstract}} describes ongoing work {{in developing}} large-scale <b>knowledge</b> <b>repositories.</b> The project addresses three primary aspects of such systems: integration of knowledge sources; access and retrieval of stored knowledge; scalable, effective repositories. Previous results {{have shown the}} effectiveness of description logicbased representations in integrating knowledge sources {{and the role of}} non-standard inferences in supporting repository reasoning tasks. Current efforts include developing general-purpose mechanisms for adapting reasoning algorithms for optimized inference under known domain structure and effective use of database technology as a large-scale knowledge base backend. <b>Knowledge</b> <b>Repositories</b> Modern scientific and engineering efforts rely on large volumes of data and knowledge. It is therefore important to support such efforts with <b>knowledge</b> <b>repositories,</b> significan...|$|R

The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide an overview of the evaluation results and to share practical experiences from building <b>knowledge</b> <b>repositories</b> with Enterprise Modelling and organisational patterns.

The presented system is one step towards incremental formalization from textual knowledge. As such, it is a valuable tool for building <b>knowledge</b> <b>repositories...</b>|$|R
40|$|Interorganizational {{knowledge}} {{networks and}} knowledge marketplaces have emerged to enable organizations to share or commercially exploit their knowledge outside narrow organizational borders. The materialization of these structures requires concrete and sound mechanisms for the efficient external provision of knowledge stored in <b>knowledge</b> <b>repositories</b> within the organization. In our approach, we employ semantic Web {{services as a}} vehicle for publishing <b>knowledge</b> <b>repositories.</b> We propose ""knowledge provision services"" as a means for efficient retrieval and composition of knowledge objects from <b>knowledge</b> <b>repositories</b> of various organizational contexts regardless of the environment within which they are delivered. In this direction, we have extended OWL-S with a knowledge object ontology, which represents knowledge objects in a generic, application-neutral way, and we have developed an infrastructure for the publication, discovery, composition, and delivery of Knowledge Provision Services founded on the Web services architecture. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
