5|$|The French Basque Country {{had been}} a {{favourite}} <b>haven</b> <b>of</b> ETA. Since mid-1968 most of ETA's leadership had lived there and {{used it as a}} base for training, infrastructure and planning attacks. ETA commandos also operated from there, crossing the border into Spain to carry out attacks before fleeing back to France. This led to complaints in Spain that French authorities were not doing enough to tackle ETA activity, preferring to leave the Basque conflict to the Spanish to deal with.|$|E

The Constitution is not a panacea for every blot upon the public welfare nor should this court, ordained as a judicial body, {{be thought of as a}} general <b>haven</b> <b>of</b> reform movements.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle Onassis's will {{established}} a charitable foundation {{in memory of}} his son, the Alexander S.

The foundation consists of two parts; a business foundation which runs various businesses including shipping, and a public benefit foundation which is the sole recipient of the business foundation. The public benefit foundation funds the worldwide promotion of Greek culture, funds the Onassis International Prizes for achievement in various fields, and the funding of scholarships for Greek university students.|$|E

5|$|Plans {{called for}} Hubble to be {{serviced}} in February 2005, but the Columbia disaster in 2003, {{in which the}} orbiter disintegrated on re-entry into the atmosphere, had wide-ranging effects on the Hubble program. NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe decided that all future shuttle missions {{had to be able}} to reach the safe <b>haven</b> <b>of</b> the International Space Station should in-flight problems develop. As no shuttles were capable of reaching both HST and the ISS during the same mission, future crewed service missions were canceled. This decision was assailed by numerous astronomers, who felt that Hubble was valuable enough to merit the human risk. HST's planned successor, the James Webb Telescope (JWST), was not expected to launch until at least 2018. A gap in space-observing capabilities between a decommissioning of Hubble and the commissioning of a successor was of major concern to many astronomers, given the significant scientific impact of HST. The consideration that JWST will not be located in low Earth orbit, and therefore cannot be easily upgraded or repaired in the event of an early failure, only makes these concerns more acute. On the other hand, many astronomers felt strongly that the servicing of Hubble should not take place if the expense were to come from the JWST budget.|$|E
5|$|The Hollywood Reporter ran {{a front-page}} story on January 13 that Hearst papers were about to run a series of editorials attacking Hollywood's {{practice}} of hiring refugees and immigrants for jobs {{that could be done}} by Americans. The goal was to put pressure on the other studios to force RKO to shelve Kane. Many of those immigrants had fled Europe after the rise of fascism and feared losing the safe <b>haven</b> <b>of</b> the United States. Soon afterwards, Schaefer was approached by Nicholas Schenck, head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's parent company, with an offer on the behalf of Louis B. Mayer and other Hollywood executives to RKO Pictures of $805,000 to destroy all prints of the film and burn the negative. Once RKO's legal team reassured Schaefer, the studio announced on January 21 that Kane would be released as scheduled, and with one of the largest promotional campaigns in the studio's history. Schaefer brought Welles to New York City for a private screening of the film with the New York corporate heads of the studios and their lawyers. There was no objection to its release provided that certain changes, including the removal or softening of specific references that might offend Hearst, were made. Welles agreed and cut the running time from 122 minutes to 119 minutes. The cuts satisfied the corporate lawyers.|$|E

25|$|Havens {{are also}} {{closely related to}} the {{existence}} of separators, small sets X of vertices in an n-vertex graph such that every X-flap has at most 2n/3 vertices. If a graph G does not have a k-vertex separator, then every set X of at most k vertices has a (unique) X-flap with more than 2n/3 vertices. In this case, G has a <b>haven</b> <b>of</b> order , in which '(X) is defined to be this unique large X-flap. That is, every graph has either a small separator or a <b>haven</b> <b>of</b> high order.|$|E

25|$|Havens {{with the}} {{touching}} definition {{are closely related}} to brambles, families of connected subgraphs of a given graph that all touch each other. The order of a bramble is the minimum number of vertices needed in a set of vertices that hits all of the subgraphs in the family. The set of flaps '(X) for a <b>haven</b> <b>of</b> order k (with the touching definition) forms a bramble of order at least k, because any set Y of fewer than k vertices fails to hit the subgraph '(Y). Conversely, from any bramble of order k, one may construct a <b>haven</b> <b>of</b> the same order, by defining '(X) (for each choice of X) to be the X-flap that includes all of the subgraphs in the bramble that are disjoint fromX. The requirement that the subgraphs in the bramble all touch each other can be used to show that this X-flap exists, and that all of the flaps '(X) chosen in this way touch each other. Thus, a graph has a bramble of order k if and only if it has a <b>haven</b> <b>of</b> orderk.|$|E

25|$|If a graph G {{contains}} a ray, a semi-infinite simple path with a starting vertex but no ending vertex, {{then it has}} a <b>haven</b> <b>of</b> order ℵ0: that is, a function ' that maps each finite set X of vertices to an X-flap, satisfying the consistency condition for havens. Namely, define '(X) to be the unique X-flap that contains infinitely many vertices of the ray. Thus, {{in the case of}} infinite graphs the connection between treewidth and havens breaks down: a single ray, despite itself being a tree, has havens of all finite orders and even more strongly a <b>haven</b> <b>of</b> order ℵ0. Two rays of an infinite graph are considered to be equivalent if there is no finite set of vertices that separates infinitely many vertices of one ray from infinitely many vertices of the other ray; this is an equivalence relation, and its equivalence classes are called ends of the graph.|$|E
