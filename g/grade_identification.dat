40|$|Abstract: In recycling, waste {{papers are}} {{segregated}} into various grades {{as they are}} subjected to different recycling processes. Highly sorted paper streams facilitate high quality end products and save processing chemicals and energy. Automated paper sorting systems offer significant advantages over human inspection in terms of worker fatigue, throughput, speed, and accuracy. As a consequence, many automated mechanical and optical paper sorting methods {{have been developed to}} fill the paper sorting demand during 1932 to 2009. Because of inadequate throughput and some major drawbacks of mechanical paper sorting systems, the popularity of optical paper sorting systems has increased. The implementation of the previous methods, while being a step forward in the large-volume automated sorting technology, is still complex, expensive and sometimes offers limited reliability. This research attempts to develop a smart vision sensing system that is able to separate the different grades of paper using chromaticity. For constructing template database, hue and saturation of the paper object image in a selected area are considered. The paper grade is identified based on the maximum occurrence of a specific template in the paper object image. The classification success rates for white paper, old newsprint paper and old corrugated cardboard are 95 %, 92 % and 90 %, respectively. Finally, the best result of the proposed method is compared with the results published in literature where waste paper <b>grade</b> <b>identification</b> systems were developed using other methods. The remarkable achievement obtained with the method is the accurate identification and dynamic sorting of all grades of papers using chromaticity, which is the best among the prevailing techniques of optical or electronic image based systems...|$|E

40|$|According to Stahl (2005), "Vocabulary {{knowledge}} is knowledge; {{the knowledge of}} a word not only implies a definition, but also implies how that word fits into the world. " Vocabulary {{knowledge is}} ongoing. Instruction in vocabulary involves {{a lot more than}} just looking up words in a dictionary and using the words in a sentence. Vocabulary is acquired indirectly through exposure to words and directly through explicit instruction in specific words and word-learning strategies. One of the recommendations of The National Reading Panel (2000) about teaching vocabulary includes word-learning strategies such as: dictionary use, morphemic analysis, and contextual analysis. Contextual analysis involves inferring the meaning of an unfamiliar word by analyzing the text surrounding it. Instruction in contextual analysis generally involves teaching students to use both generic and specific types of context clues. In the primary <b>grades,</b> word <b>identification</b> instruction focuses on helping children to understand the alphabetic principle and to quickly (to the point of automaticity) relate the letters and spelling patterns of written words to their corresponding speech sounds. Once beginning readers are able to do this, they begin to focus less attention on word reading, or decoding, and more attention on constructing meaning from what they read. Beyond the primary <b>grades,</b> word <b>identification</b> instruction focuses on teaching students skills that they can apply to read difficult or unfamiliar multisyllabic words—the kind of words often found in content area reading materials and textbooks.

40|$|Promoter region hyermethylation and {{transcriptional}} silencing is {{a frequent}} cause of tumour suppressor gene (TSG) inactivation in many types of human cancers. Functional epigenetic studies, in which gene expression is induced by treatment with demethylating agents, may identify novel genes with tumour-specific methylation. We used high-density gene expression microarrays in a functional epigenetic study of 11 renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines. Twenty eight genes were then selected for analysis of promoter methylation status in cell lines and primary RCC. Eight genes (BNC 1, PDLIM 4, RPRM, CST 6, SFRP 1, GREM 1, COL 14 A 1 and COL 15 A 1) demonstrated frequent (> 30 % of RCC tested) tumour-specific promoter region methylation.

In this dissertation, I explored {{the usefulness of the}} Response-to-Intervention (RtI) framework for identifying children with RD by examining the use of 1 st and 2 nd grade reading measures and responsiveness criteria for predicting RD in 3 rd grade. Data were derived from a longitudinal RtI project executed in low-income, high-poverty schools in Southern California. Participants attended one of five schools from 1 st to 3 rd grade and had access to a high-quality Tier II intervention during their attendance. I used logistic regression to identify reading measures most useful for predicting RD in word reading/fluency (WR-F) and comprehension/vocabulary (C-V) separately; I then paired intervention responsiveness criteria with significant predictors and explored RD classification accuracy using 2 x 2 contingency tables. Model-based results generally yielded superior classification accuracy compared to single-measure predictors of RD; however, 1 st <b>grade</b> word <b>identification</b> and 2 nd grade oral reading fluency showed promise as isolated measures for predicting RD in WR-F. Model-based predictions were required to obtain adequate classification accuracy for RD in C-V. While the former finding is promising for early identification of those students in need of more intensive instruction in lexical or fluency-based skills, the latter finding reaffirms literature attesting to the complexity of RD in comprehension and difficulty of predicting such deficits using early measures of reading, which principally assess word reading skill. Models and classification analyses replicated well with an independent sample, thus enhancing confidence in study results. Practical implications and need for future research are discussed...|$|R

The Ca/Fe ratio {{was found to be}} an {{effective}} parameter to distinguish between turbidites and pelagites, because turbidites generally have higher Fe contents and lower Ca contents compared with pelagic intervals. Beds that were obscure when visually logged could be identified as turbidites or pelagites on their geochemical characteristics, allowing more complete subdivision of the sequence into genetic units. The ITRAX XRF data also provide useful information on textural <b>grading,</b> bioturbative mixing, <b>identification</b> of geochemically distinctive marker beds, indications of differences in provenance, and confirm or query the presence of early arrivals during turbidite emplace-ment. A chronostratigraphic framework for the core based on accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating and correlation with oxygen isotope stages of pelagic intervals in other cores (using calcium carbonate stratigraphy) was also established.

40|$|Self-efficacy {{significantly}} influences human functioning. It is {{not only}} individual's belief about his capabilities but also what {{he thinks he can}} achieve with them. This bachelor's theses is concerned with a specific domain of self-efficacy in mathematics and also with variables related to mathematics. The theoretical part summarizes a basic theoretical background of self-efficacy with an emphasis on the self- efficacy concept from Albert Bandura. Other parts involve topics such as academic self-efficacy, mathematical self-efficacy and gender differences in mathematical performance and attitude toward mathematics. The empirical part describes the realized research. Its goal was to find out the measure of self-efficacy of children in four grade of elementary school. The research was also focused on a relationship between self-efficacy and other variables (performance in mathematics, <b>grades</b> in mathematics, <b>identification</b> with mathematics) and concerned with a question whether there are any gender differences in math self-efficacy and in those other variables. Methods used in this research were two kinds of questionnaires and a mathematical test. Results of this research suggest that there are no gender differences in mathematical self-efficacy, neither in other variables. On the other hand, there were some [...] ...|$|R
