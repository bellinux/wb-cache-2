5|$|The missing {{connection}} between US 1 and MD 295 {{resulted in a}} circuitous path for traffic between I-95 and BWI Airport. In 1974, that route involved exiting I-95 at MD 100, which then served as a connector between the Interstate and US 1. Traffic took US 1 south to MD 176, then took MD 176 east to MD 295 and north to {{the western end of}} MD 46. Construction on the missing link, which by then was planned as part of I-195, began in 1987, when the highway's bridges over US 1 and I-895 were constructed. The remainder of the highway from MD 295 to the I-895 overpass was completed, including reconstruction of the interchange with MD 295, and the <b>intermediate</b> <b>section</b> opened in June 1990. The I-195 designation was applied to the highway's present length at the same time, and MD 166 was truncated to its present southern terminus. In 2002, as part of an expansion project at the airport, several new ramps were constructed to access parking lots and facilitate an easier U-turn for motorists leaving the terminal who wish to return to the terminal. In 2015, the eastern terminus of I-195 was cut back from the BWI Airport to the MD 170 interchange, with the section of road between those two points becoming MD 995A.|$|E

50|$|The ER2 {{trainset}} {{consists of}} 2-car sections, {{each of which}} includes a power car and a trailer (either a driving trailer with an engineer's cab on one end, or an intermediate trailer without an engineer's cab). Sections with a driving trailer are called head sections; those with an intermediate trailer are called <b>intermediate</b> <b>sections.</b> The sections cannot operate independently; the minimum train length is 2 head sections, and the maximum is 6 sections (2 head <b>sections</b> and 4 <b>intermediate</b> <b>sections),</b> with a train 5 sections long (2 head and 3 intermediate) considered standard. Coupling more than 6 sections is unsafe due to overloading of motor-generators which power the engineer's controls.

25|$|The {{report and}} debate {{lead to the}} league reorganising to allow for {{promotion}} and relegation {{prior to the start}} of the 1958-59 season. There were eight teams in each league section. A Qualifying League in two sections provided two lower rungs for the league, with a further <b>Intermediate</b> <b>section</b> below that. The formation of the sections again proved controversial, as some clubs were not placed in the section that their previous seasons standing would merit. In particular, it was reported that Saintfield (Intermediate A) had finished above four clubs in 1957-58 that were placed in Qualifying B.|$|E

25|$|The Loire {{changed its}} course, due to tectonic deformations, from the {{original}} outfall into the English Channel to its new outfall into the Atlantic Ocean thereby creating the presently seen narrow terrain of gorges, the Loire Valley with alluvium formations and the long stretch of beaches along the Atlantic Ocean. The river {{can be divided into}} three main zones; the Upper Loire which is the area from the source to the confluence with the Allier, the middle Loire Valley which is the area from the Allier to the confluence with the Maine, about , and the Lower Loire which is the area from Maine to the estuary. In the upper basin the river flows through a narrow, incised valley, marked by gorges and forests on the edges and a distinct low population. In the <b>intermediate</b> <b>section,</b> the alluvial plain broadens and the river meanders and forks into multi-channels. River flow is particularly high in the river area near Roanne and Vichy up to the confluence with the Allier. In the middle section of the river in the Loire Valley, numerous dikes built between the 12th and 19th century exist, providing mitigation against flooding. In this section the river is relatively straight, except for the area near Orléans and numerous sand banks and islands exist. The lower course of the river is characterized by wetlands and fens, which are of major importance to conservationists given that they form unique habitats for migratory birds.|$|E

2500|$|On 7 July 1999, {{the then}} Federal Minister of Transport Franz Müntefering {{informed}} the Bavarian Minister-President Edmund Stoiber {{that the new}} line and upgraded line would not be built for the time being. Because of {{the high cost of}} the project estimated to be DM 7 to 8 billion, other transport projects in Northern Bavaria, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia would have been impossible. The scarce available funds would have to be used as efficiently as possible, according to Müntefering. In coordination with Deutsche Bahn, the Federal Government was pursuing a new strategy, in which [...] "the emphasis would be on the maintenance and upgrading of existing routes". The section between Erfurt and Arnstadt would be [...] "connected by a modified <b>intermediate</b> <b>section</b> to the existing line between Arnstadt and Saalfeld". Trains at Arnstadt would be routed to Saalfeld via a connecting line to the Großheringen–Saalfeld railway and would run from there to Nuremberg. The journey time from Erfurt to Nuremberg would therefore decrease from 186 to 143minutes. An extension of the construction through the Thuringian Forest was kept open. The Supervisory Board of Deutsche Bahn decided not to pursue the project any further. Other alternative plans, however, were to use the Erfurt–Arnstadt–(Saalfeld) section with diesel regional cars. The Saxony-Anhalt Transport Minister Jürgen Heyer demanded to realisation of the new lew line over its full-length. The proposals led to disputes within the then CDU/SPD state government in Thuringia. Minister-President Vogel (CDU) was not able to defend his position at a cabinet meeting, calling for a correction of the decision at the federal level. It became an issue in the Thuringian Landtag election in 1999, in which Minister-President Vogel criticised the federal government repeatedly because of this decision.|$|E
