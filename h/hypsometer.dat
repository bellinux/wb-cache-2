Os dados foram coletados em varas telescópicas (A, B e C com 4, 45; 10, 75 e 7, 8 m, respectivamente) por treze observadores. As alturas medidas foram avaliadas por meio de uma análise de variância em um delineamento em blocos casualizados, e as médias comparadas pelo teste de Tukey. Também foi utilizado o Teste t (99 % de significância) para comparar a igualdade entre a altura total real de cada vara e as alturas medidas com os hipsômetros. Os resultados mostraram que apenas o RL foi diferente dos demais hipsômetros quando avaliados conjuntamente. Os hipsômetros VX, HG e BL apresentaram os melhores resultados em todas as análises, apresentando alta semelhança à altura real.

Data were collected from telescopic poles (A, B and C with 4. 45, 10. 75 and 7. 8 m, respectively) using thirteen different observers. The height was analyzed by analysis of variance in randomized block and tested by Tukey test. The t test (99 % significance) was also used to compare equality between real total height of each telescopic pole and heights measured with <b>hypsometers.</b> The results showed that only the RL was different from other <b>hypsometers</b> when all were analyzed together. The <b>hypsometers</b> VX, HG and BL showed the best results in all analyzes, presenting a high semblance to the real height. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} balloon-borne radiosonde {{employed for}} synoptic meteorology provides vertical profiles of temperature, pressure, and humidity {{as a function}} of elapsed time. These parameters are used in the hypsometric equation to calculate the geopotential altitude at each sampling point during the balloon's flight. It is important that the vertical location information be accurate. The present investigation was conducted with the objective to evaluate the altitude determination accuracy of the standard radiosonde throughout the entire balloon profile. The tests included two other commercially available pressure sensors {{to see if they could}} provide improved accuracy in the stratosphere. The pressure-measuring performance of standard baroswitches, premium baroswitches, and <b>hypsometers</b> in balloon-borne sondes was correlated with tracking radars. It was found that the standard and premium baroswitches perform well up to about 25 km altitude, while <b>hypsometers</b> provide more reliable data above 25 km...|$|R

50|$|Looking at the {{geometry}} involved in step 1 results in sketch a: two right angled triangles, shown {{here with the}} identical small angles in yellow.

5000|$|Hypsometry (from Greek ὕψος, hupsos, [...] "height" [...] and μέτρον, metron, [...] "measure") is the {{measurement}} of land elevation relative to sea level. Bathymetry is the underwater equivalent. A <b>hypsometer</b> is an instrument used in hypsometry, which estimates the elevation by boiling water - water boils at different temperatures depending on the air pressure, and thus altitude.|$|E
50|$|Some laser <b>hypsometers</b> have a {{built in}} height {{measurement}} function. Before using this function the user should read the {{instructions on how}} it works. In some implementations it calculates tree heights using the flawed tangent method, while in others {{it allows you to}} use the better sine top/sine bottom method. The sine top /sine bottom method may be called the vertical distance function or a two-point method. For example, the Nikon Forestry 550 implements the sine top/sine bottom method only, while the successor the Forestry Pro has both a two-point measurement and a three-point measurement function. The three-point measurement function uses the tangent method, while the two point method uses the sine top/sine bottom method. The top and bottom triangles are automatically measured using the two point function and added together, giving an accurate height measurement.|$|R
50|$|A simple scale <b>hypsometer</b> {{allows the}} height of a {{building}} or tree to be measured by sighting across a ruler to the base and top of the object being measured, when the distance from the object to the observer is known. Modern hypsometers use a combination of laser rangefinder and clinometer to measure distances to {{the top and bottom of}} objects, and the angle between the lines from the observer to each to calculate height.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} such a scale <b>hypsometer</b> is {{illustrated}} here, and can be seen to consist of a sighting tube, a fixed horizontal scale, and an adjustable vertical scale with attached plumb line. The principle of operation of such a scale <b>hypsometer</b> is based on the idea of similar triangles in geometry. First the adjustable vertical scale is set at a suitable height. Then as in step 1 in the illustration, a sighting is taken {{on the top of the}} object whose height is to be determined, and the reading on the horizontal scale, h', recorded. Calculation from this value will eventually give the height h, from the eye-line of the observer to the top of the object whose height is to be determined. Similarly as in step 2 of the illustration, a sighting is taken on the base of the object whose height is to be determined, and the reading on the horizontal scale, d', recorded. Calculation from this value will eventually give the distance from the base of the object to the eye-line of the observer. Finally the distance x from the observer to the object needs to be measured.|$|E
50|$|Many of the {{limitations}} and errors associated with the stick method and the tangent method can be overcome by using a laser rangefinder {{in conjunction with a}} clinometer, or a <b>hypsometer,</b> which incorporates both devices into a single unit. A laser rangefinder is a device which uses a laser beam to determine the distance to an object. The laser rangefinder sends a laser pulse in a narrow beam toward the object and measures the time taken by the pulse to be reflected off the target and returned to the sender. Different instruments have different degrees of accuracy and precision.|$|E

50|$|Odell {{had brought}} a thermometer, and no doubt sighed for the <b>hypsometer.</b> From it {{we found that the}} air {{temperature}} was 20 F but {{in the absence of the}} wind we could bask gratefully in the friendly rays of our late enemy the sun. It was difficult to realise that we were actually standing on top of the same peak which we had viewed two months ago from Ranikhet, and which had then appeared incredibly remote and inaccessible, and it gave us a curious feeling of exaltation to know that we were above every peak within a hundred miles on either hand. Dhaulagiri, 1,000ft higher, and 200 miles away in Nepal, was our nearest rival. I believe we so far forgot ourselves as to shake hands on it.|$|E
50|$|Strained {{political}} {{tensions between}} Russia and Britain prevented Gill from following his original planned route. Instead, he and Mesny agreed to travel via eastern Tibet to northern Burma (Myanmar). They {{set out on}} 10 July 1877 with their servants and 60 porters. They entered eastern Tibet via Tachienlu (Kangding). From there, Gill, Mesny and their party climbed to the Tibetan plateau, which is mostly more than 2 miles above sea level. Passing through Litang, they reached Batang in the valley of {{a tributary of the}} Jinsha River, then regarded by Europeans as the true upper Yangtze. Jinsha means “golden sand” and Gill named his book on the expedition The River of Golden Sand. Crossing the Jinsha, the party followed its valley or the ridge between it and the upper Mekong valley for 24 days to Dali City (Talifu), the western capital of Yunnan. Up to that point, Gill had surveyed the entire route and measured the altitude with aneroid barometers and a <b>hypsometer.</b> They were now in known territory, as Edward Colborne Baber had already surveyed the route from Dali to the Irrawaddy while investigating the murder of Gill’s schoolmate Augustus Margary. Gill and Mesny arrived at Bhamo in Burma on 1 November 1877, where they met Thomas Cooper, whose advice Gill had sought in London. Cooper was now the local British political agent; he was murdered five months later. From Bhamo, the party took a steamer down the Irrawaddy River to Rangoon and then travelled by sea to Calcutta, where they disbanded. William Gill’s scientific work, including the Chinese expeditions and the resulting 42 sheets of maps, was recognised on 26 May 1879, when the Royal Geographical Society awarded him their Patron's Gold Medal. The following year, the Geographical Society of Paris awarded Gill a gold medal.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the influence of different sources of variation in tree height measurements using hypsometers based on trigonometric principles. The use of this type of device requires that the measurement is at a known distance from the tree. Therefore, if these distances are small or too big, oscillations can occur during the reading of the device or difficulties to visualize the tree tops, causing errors in the height measurement. Thereby, in this study a set of tree heights were measured with a <b>hypsometer</b> at different distances and by three different individuals. Afterwards, the results were compared with the actual heights of the trees obtained by climbing them. Finally, after the analysis, the results indicated that the distance of measurement, along with the <b>hypsometer</b> used, affects in obtaining estimation of the total height...|$|E
30|$|Specimens of a 38 -year-old sugi {{cultivar}} (Tosaaka; Table  1) were used.

40|$|The {{pressure}} sensors on balloon-borne sondes relate the sonde measurements to height above the Earth's surface through the hypsometric equation. It {{is crucial that}} sondes used to explore the vertical structure of the atmosphere do not contribute significant height errors to their measurements of atmospheric constituent concentrations and properties. A series of radiosonde flights was conducted. In most cases, each flight consisted of two sondes attached to a single balloon and each flight was tracked by a highly accurate C-band radar. For the first 19 radiosonde flights, the standard aneroid cell baroswitch assembly used was the pressure sensor. The last 26 radiosondes were equipped with a premium grade aneroid cell baroswitch assembly sensor and with a <b>hypsometer.</b> It is shown that both aneroid cell baroswitch sensors become increasingly inaccurate with altitude.

The annual rainfall in these areas varies from 1600  mm to 4500  mm. The mean annual minimum and maximum temperatures vary from 11 °C to 38 °C. The plots are located throughout the teak growing areas in the state and were selected to represent the existing range of ages, stand densities and sites. The plots are rectangular and their size ranged from 220 to 436  m 2, depending on stand density, in order to achieve a minimum of 30 trees per plot. The diameter at breast height (dbh, 1.37  m above the ground) was measured to the nearest 0.1  cm with digital callipers in all trees in the plots. Total height was measured to the nearest 0.1  m with a digital <b>hypsometer.</b> Age was calculated from the year of planting.

For a subset of 18, 146 of these trees, the tree type (deciduous or coniferous) was specified. No height data is available in this existing database. A second dataset with tree height measurements for large significant trees obtained by laser rangefinder and species identification was available for Stanley Park and Kerrisdale area. To complement these datasets, an additional field campaign was completed in four city parks: Queen Elizabeth Park, Memorial West Park, Musqueam Park and Locarno Park. A Vertex ultrasound <b>hypsometer</b> was used to determine the height of identified crowns and the average of two tape measurements on perpendicular axes constituted the recorded value for crown diameter.

To evaluate the accuracy obtainable, 50 radiosonde flights were launched from the U. S. Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California. Thirty-five flights carried aloft the AN/AMT- 4 B model transmitter alongside the prototype AN/AMT- 11 DX transmitter and 15 flights carried the AN/AMT- 11 C model along with the AN/AMT- 4 B. All data obtained were reduced by the Geophysics Division, Pacific Missile Range, Point Mugu, California, on a CDC- 3100 computer and graphically by the experimenter on the WBAN- 31 series adiabatic charts. Values of temperature, relative humidity, and pressure as determined by each instrument were compared at each 3 -minute interval of each flight and values of temperature, pressure altitude, relative humidity and dewpoint were compared at standard pressure levels.

In the Nundle 2002  AC stand, 52 of the plots were used (ranging from 7.98  m to 17.84  m in radius), providing a cluster of selected trees containing approximately 23 trees per plot on average (two plots were inaccessible). The use of “flexible radius” plots that is varying the plot radius according to the estimated stocking density, was employed to maintain an approximately constant workload throughout the survey (Melville et al. 2015). However the plots themselves were chosen with equal probability within strata. In the field, plot centres were located using two GPS units (Garmin Ltd.), and then validated through crown interpretation of open spaces between trees using printed copies of the LiDAR imagery. Every tree in each selected cluster was labelled and diameter at breast height over bark (DBH at 1.3  m) measured. At least five trees per selected cluster, representing the tallest trees, were selected and their heights measured using a <b>hypsometer</b> (Vertex III, Haglof, Sweden). These trees were used to predict the heights of the non-measured trees using the nonlinear dominant height vs DBH relationships which are used by FCNSW for this species.

One easily measured factor is tree cover, which provides aesthetics to residential property and shade that may help reduce home cooling costs in the summer months. This study analyzes 30 residential city blocks, selected using a modified stratified sampling, within the city limits of Boise, Idaho. Data collected include both web-based as well as field-based measurement. GoogleEarth ® and 2014 NAIP imagery were used to measure canopy area for each tree on a block. Tree cover, the percentage of the block that the tree crowns occupy, when viewed from above, was quantified for each residential block. Home values and tree counts were collected from the Ada County Assessors Office website. Heights of trees around the perimeter (front yards and lawn strip) were measured in the field using a <b>hypsometer.</b> At the block level, average tree heights, percent canopy cover, and tree density (count/hectare) were compared to average house value, and the data do suggest that mature trees growing around a block are positively correlated with average property values. Looking at fluctuations in house values over the past nine years, however, there is a negative correlation between percent change in house value and canopy cover. Possible explanations, such as property floor values, are discussed.

The whole measurement process consists of three steps: time needed to reach the measurement zone, time needed to determine the distance to a tree, and time needed to measure and read the height of a tree. Measurements were conducted with four hypsometers: Vertex, Blume-Leiss, Bitterlich 2 ̆ 7 s Spiegel Relaskop with a standard scale (RO) and Bitterlich 2 ̆ 7 s Spiegel Relaskop with a CP scale (with the horizontally /RCPH/ or vertically /RCPV/ positioned staff). Research results do not show any statistically important differences among the hypsometers in terms of time needed to reach the measurement zone. In measuring tree heights in a stricter sense (without the element of reaching the measurement zone), the least amount of time was required by the Vertex (28. 4 cmin) on average. The Vertex is followed by the relaskop with a CP scale, the horizontally (57. 4 cmin) or vertically positioned staff (86. 1 cmin), then the Blume-Leiss (84. 0 cmin) and finally the relaskop with a standard scale (106. 8 cmin).
