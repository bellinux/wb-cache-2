30|$|The {{results of}} this study viewed in {{conjunction}} with those of the previous seven studies led to two conclusions. The first conclusion concerns the factors and structure of the FLCAS. Our exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses showed a two-factor model that consists of communication apprehension (seven items) and fear of failing (five items), although the first run of exploratory factor analysis produced six factors with an eigenvalue greater than 1. Consistently, the other seven studies also documented multiple factors, with a range of two to four components. Accordingly, it is reasonable to conclude that the FLCAS measure has multiple <b>dimensional</b> <b>factors</b> in terms of students’ fear and anxiety about foreign language learning.|$|R

Our findings suggest the possible usefulness of specific cognitive trainings for bipolar patients, with a focus on executive functions.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} an econometric {{theory for}} large <b>dimensional</b> <b>factor</b> models with a multi-level factor structure. Such a multi-level feature arises {{in a wide}} range of eco-nomic applications, such as 8 ̆ 5 nance, labor economics and international economics. For example, in labor economics, households can be divided into di¤erent income groups, each group facing both economy-wide common risk and group-speci 8 ̆ 5 c risk. The base-line model is a two-level factor model, where factors are interpreted as unobserved economic shocks and categorized into two types: one is pervasive, a¤ecting all eco-nomic sectors; the other is nonpervasive, a¤ecting only a speci 8 ̆ 5 c economic sector. Under these assumptions, the resulting large <b>dimensional</b> <b>factor</b> model has two fea-tures that are di¤erent from the usual model: (i) a large number of zero restrictions are imposed on factor loadings; (ii) the number of factors grows with the number of sectors. I provide a minimal set of identifying conditions of these two types of factors, as well as e¤ective estimation methods. The estimators, which are jointly determined by a set of eigenvector problems, are shown to be consistent and have a normal limiting distribution. Finally, I apply the model to investigate di¤erent patterns of comovement within real and 8 ̆ 5 nancial sectors respectively. Empirical results suggest that comove-ment within each sector is largely sector speci 8 ̆ 5 c and the pervasive common factors play only a limited role.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, {{collaborative}} governance has emerged {{as an alternative to}} traditionally adversarial approaches such as hierarchical command-and-control regulation. A wide range of governance theory praises collaborative governance with multi-stakeholders’ participation as an effective strategy to deal with a public issue. Environmental deterioration, such as water pollution, is a cross-cutting issue that has been in a favour of collaborative approaches to resolve. The promise of collaborative environmental governance is to make environmental policy more effective for sustainability. However, multi-stakeholders’ participation poses challenges in practice if it really makes any difference to and is compatible with environmental policy decision-making processes within a set timeframe. Power imbalance, for example, entails legitimacy deficits to ensure the effectiveness of collaborative environmental governance. Therefore, legitimacy is an important concept that defines a political acceptance whether or to what extent collaborative governance can result in more sustainable or effective environmental policy. This study assesses legitimacy of collaborative environmental governance by using the Manawatu River Leaders’ Forum (MRLF), a collaborative forum to solve water quality issue in southern North Island of New Zealand, as a case study. The study focuses on developing a framework for assessing legitimacy based on three types of legitimacy including input, output and throughput legitimacy that are applicable to explore the MRLF’s effectiveness. In corresponding to these legitimacy types, the legitimacy assessment framework is designed with three <b>dimensional</b> <b>factors</b> including participatory quality, policy effectiveness and collaborative process with their own indicators and criteria. Results of analysing published data indicate that the MRLF is basically legitimated as a fundamental commencement for collaboration as participations by different stakeholders are active and collective decisions have been implemented. However, interviews with MRLF’s key stakeholders demonstrate different perspectives on legitimacy through an existing conflict. Through the three <b>dimensional</b> <b>factors,</b> governmental stakeholders perceive high legitimacy, while most non-governmental stakeholders perceive low legitimacy. This study suggests ways to look conflict as a collaborative learning, rather than fighting, to bridge a synergy between collaboration and conflict. Although collaboration aims to resolve conflicts, collaboration should be learnt as one aspect of conflict management through controversial policy settings...|$|R
