Simulations are conducted under normal wind forcing, as well as under increased and decreased wind speeds. It is found that the lack of a shear strength parameterization in the cavitating fluid rheology produces significantly different results in both ice thickness and ice velocity than those produced by an elliptical rheology. Furthermore, use of a 28 -category ice thickness distribution amplifies differences in the responses of the various models. While the choice of dynamic model is governed by requirements of accuracy and implementation, it appears that, in terms of both parameterization of physical properties and computational time, the elliptical rheology is well-suited for inclusion in a GCM. 1...|$|E

Though there exist data that can be explained by such feedback mechanisms, and indeed IA may be an intuitive approach to complex tasks like reading, little effort has been made to explain these same phenomena without feedback.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, to {{simulate}} the thermal response destructive behavior, a finite element algorithm (FEA) has been developed [5] for the dynamic thermo-elasticity coupling problem of materials incorporated with the GKUA for solving the exterior hypersonic reentry aerothermodynamic environment, in which the Newmark implicit scheme is employed to discretize the dynamic thermoelasticity equation and the Crank-Nicolson scheme is used to solve the heat-conduction equation [41]. In engineering problems, the determination of thermal stresses is usually carried out in two steps. First, the temperature distribution is obtained from the Fourier’s heat-conduction equation, the stresses are then calculated by the equations of thermoelasticity, including the temperature terms in the stress-strain relations. When subjected to the strong aerodynamic force and rigorous aerodynamic heating, the material deformation will significantly affect the temperature distribution {{in the interior of}} the material. The thermal-induced vibration should also not be neglected, and the heat propagation should be viewed as a wave phenomenon rather than a diffusion phenomenon. For this reason, a unified consideration and analysis to the coupled system of heat transfer, deformation and stresses on material and structure [42] <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>simulate</b> the real physical and mechanical problem.

40|$|Internal {{gravity waves}} in the oceans are a limited scale process capable of {{providing}} sufficient energy to activate strong diapycnal mixing near sloping bathymetry. This can account for {{a significant portion of}} oceanic vertical mixing. Mixing can be locally intense, transporting colder nutrient-rich bottom water up onto continental margins with implications for coastal marine ecosystems and the carbon cycle. Modelling internal waves is particularly challenging. The strong vertical accelerations present in the overturning and breaking of internal waves necessitates a non-hydrostatic model, and the small-scale processes that result from the interaction of internal waves with bathymetry mean that traditional structured mesh models require high-resolution to adequately capture flow complexity. I present two-dimensional results of numerical simulations of internal waves being generated and interacting with idealised bathymetry, using the Imperial College Ocean Model (Fluidity-ICOM), a non-hydrostatic, finite-element, unstructured mesh model incorporating anisotropic mesh adaptivity. The unstructured nature of Fluidity-ICOM allows the mesh to be optimised to represent complex bathymetries, as well as capturing the vertically inhomogeneous structure of internal waves. Convergence of the model to analytical results has been demonstrated by modelling internal wave propagation in a linearly stratified fluid. Adaptive mesh simulations have been found to adequately capture the dynamics of internal wave breaking at a slope, and the degeneration of interfacial waves into solitary internal waves, with less computational resources than traditional models.

In order to simulate these processes, three different models characterized by different levels of details are analyzed in this work for a stirred tank. They are mainly divided in two types: two zero-dimensional (0 D) models, in which spatial homogeneity and perfect mixing of the disperse and continuous phases is assumed, and three-dimensional (3 D) models, where the inhomogeneous mixing and spatial distribution of the phases is considered. One of the 0 D models considers the spatial distribution of the turbulent dissipation rate (homogeneous model), while the other one employs only the average value of this variable in the tank (lumped model). The 3 D model is instead based on the Eulerian-Eulerian two-fluid approach, implemented in computational fluid dynamics codes. The comparison of the results obtained imposing the very same operating conditions between the simplest 0 D models (implemented in MATLAB), which are computationally very cheap, and the complex 3 D models (implemented in OpenFOAM- 2. 2. x), which are computationally intensive, highlights their range of validity, allowing to establish a priori which level of details or approach <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>simulate</b> a particular system...|$|E

Flow connections between the control volumes are introduced, as laminar or turbulent orifices to model the displacing action and the internal leakages of the unit.
