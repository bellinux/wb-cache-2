5|$|Miking a Leslie is also {{important}} in a recording studio, as the choice and positioning of microphones determines the overall recorded sound. A popular recommendation is two Shure SM57s on the <b>horn</b> <b>and</b> a Sennheiser MD421 on the drum. Recording Magazine's Dave Martin suggests a similar setup, with various microphone models used as stereo pairs on the horn but using an Electro-Voice RE20 on the drum instead. Keith Emerson recorded his Leslie using a single mic each on the <b>horn</b> <b>and</b> the drum, but with the covers removed.|$|E

5|$|Daniel Boone {{was honored}} with a 6-cent stamp in the American Folklore Series on September 26, 1968, at Frankfort, Kentucky, {{where he was}} buried.

A wall of roughly-hewn boards displays the tools of Boone's trade—a Pennsylvania rifle, a powder <b>horn,</b> <b>and</b> a knife. The pipe tomahawk represents that the Shawnees had adopted Boone. His name and birth date were carved on the wall.|$|E

A September 18 recording session finished the album, adding the <b>horns</b> <b>and</b> strings, as well as some additional piano from Randi, who played all the keyboard parts on the album as the band now had no keyboard player.|$|R

5|$|A Leslie speaker {{consists}} {{of a number of}} individual components. The audio signal enters the amplifier from the instrument. Once amplified, the signal travels to an audio crossover, which splits it into separate frequency bands that can be individually routed to each loudspeaker. Different models have different combinations of speakers, but the most common model, the 122, {{consists of}} a single woofer for bass and a single compression driver and acoustic horn for treble. The audio emitted by the speakers is isolated inside an enclosure, aside from a number of outlets that lead towards either a rotating horn or drum. An electric motor rotates both <b>horn</b> <b>and</b> drum at a constant speed.|$|E
5|$|After leaving False Bay on 1 July, Bounty set {{out across}} the {{southern}} Indian Ocean on the long voyage to their next port of call, Adventure Bay in Tasmania. They passed the remote Île Saint-Paul, a small uninhabited island which Bligh knew from earlier navigators contained fresh water and a hot spring, {{but he did not}} attempt a landing. The weather was cold and wintry, conditions akin to the vicinity of Cape <b>Horn,</b> <b>and</b> it was difficult to take navigational observations, but Bligh's skill was such that on 19 August he sighted Mewstone Rock, on the south-west corner of Tasmania and, two days later, made anchorage in Adventure Bay.|$|E

During this period of inactivity, Mesudiye received a minor modernization at the Tersâne-i Âmire shipyard on the Golden Horn. At {{the start of the}} Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, Mesudiye was found to be unfit for combat, as were most of the other major warships of the fleet. On 15 May Mesudiye and several other warships attempted to hold a training exercise, which only highlighted the poor state of training of the ships' crews.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} large nasal <b>horn</b> <b>and</b> four long frill spikes, the cranial {{ornamentation}} was variable. Some individuals had small hook-like projections and knobs at the posterior margin of the frill, similar to but smaller than those in Centrosaurus. Others had less prominent tabs. Some, like the type individual, had a third pair of long frill spikes. Others had much smaller projections, and small points are found on the side margins of some but not all specimens. Modest pyramid-shaped brow horns were present in subadults, but were replaced by pits in adults. Like most ceratopsids, Styracosaurus had large fenestrae (skull openings) in its frill. The front of the mouth had a toothless beak.|$|E
5|$|Because a Leslie speaker modifies {{as well as}} amplifies the sound, {{the output}} cannot simply be {{connected}} to a larger PA system if the volume onstage from the built-in amplifier is too quiet. This is particularly problematic for an older Leslie like the 122 or 147, which only has a 40 watt RMS power amplifier. Instead, microphones are placed around the Leslie, and the output from these {{is connected to the}} PA. A typical setup for onstage miking is to use two microphones placed {{on opposite sides of the}} <b>horn</b> <b>and</b> a single microphone on the drum.|$|E

Horn would often furtively {{practice}} music instead; when his father found out, he destroyed the family's clavichord {{in the hopes of}} preventing his son from becoming distracted from his studies. This, though, did not dissuade Horn from taking music lessons from Nordhausen organist Christoph Gottlieb Schröter.|$|E
