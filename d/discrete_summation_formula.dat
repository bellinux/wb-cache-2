40|$|Random {{quantities}} {{of interest in}} operations research models can often be determined conveniently {{in the form of}} transforms. Hence, numerical transform inversion can be an effective way to obtain desired numerical values of cumulative distribution functions, probability density functions and probability mass functions. However, numerical transform inversion has not been widely used. This lack of use seems to be due, at least in part, to good simple numerical inversion algorithms not being well known. To help remedy this situation, in this paper we present a version of the Fourier-series method for numerically inverting probability generating functions. We obtain a simple algorithm with a convenient error bound from the <b>discrete</b> Poisson <b>summation</b> <b>formula.</b> The same general approach applies to other transforms.

40|$|We generalize the {{standard}} Poisson <b>summation</b> <b>formula</b> for lattices {{so that it}} operates {{on the level of}} theta series, allowing us to introduce noninteger dimension parameters (using the dimensionally continued Fourier transform). When combined with one of the proofs of the Jacobi imaginary transformation of theta functions that does not use the Poisson <b>summation</b> <b>formula,</b> our proof of this generalized Poisson <b>summation</b> <b>formula</b> also provides a new proof of {{the standard}} Poisson <b>summation</b> <b>formula</b> for dimensions greater than 2 (with appropriate hypotheses on the function being summed). In general, our methods work to establish the (Voronoi) <b>summation</b> <b>formulae</b> associated with functions satisfying (modular) transformations of the Jacobi imaginary type by means of a density argument (as opposed to the usual Mellin transform approach). In particular, we construct a family of generalized theta series from Jacobi theta functions from which these <b>summation</b> <b>formulae</b> can be obtained. This family contains several families of modular forms, but is significantly more general than any of them.

40|$|This thesis in {{analytic}} {{number theory}} consists of 3 parts and 13 individual papers. In {{the first part}} we prove some results in Turán power sum theory. We solve a problem of Paul Erdös and disprove conjectures of Paul Turán and K. Ramachandra that would have implied important results on the Riemann zeta function. In the second part we prove some new results on moments of the Hurwitz and Lerch zeta functions (generalized versions of the Riemann zeta function) on the critical line. In {{the third and final}} part we consider the following question: What is the natural generalization of the classical Poisson <b>summation</b> <b>formula</b> from the Fourier analysis of the real line to the matrix group SL(2,R) ? There are candidates in the literature such as the pre-trace formula and the Selberg trace formula. We develop a new <b>summation</b> <b>formula</b> for sums over the matrix group SL(2,Z) which we propose as a candidate for the title "The Poisson <b>summation</b> <b>formula</b> for SL(2,Z) ". The <b>summation</b> <b>formula</b> allows us to express a sum over SL(2,Z) of smooth functions f on SL(2,R) with compact support, in terms of spectral theory coming from the full modular group, such as Maass wave forms, holomorphic cusp forms and the Eisenstein series. In contrast, the pre-trace formula allows us to get such a result only if we assume that f is also SO(2) bi-invariant. We indicate the <b>summation</b> <b>formula's</b> relationship with additive divisor problems and the fourth power moment of the Riemann zeta function as given by Motohashi.

40|$|Plane {{partitions}} {{have been}} widely studied in Mathematics since MacMahon. See, for example, the works by Andrews, Macdonald, Stanley, Sagan and Krattenthaler. The Schur process approach, introduced by Okounkov and Reshetikhin, and further developed by Borodin, Corwin, Corteel, Savelief and Vuletić, has been {{proved to be a}} powerful tool in the study of various kinds of plane partitions. The exact enumerations of ordinary plane partitions, shifted plane partitions and cylindric partitions could be derived from two <b>summation</b> <b>formulas</b> for Schur processes, namely, the open <b>summation</b> <b>formula</b> and the cylindric <b>summation</b> <b>formula.</b> In this paper, we establish a new <b>summation</b> <b>formula</b> for Schur processes, called the complete <b>summation</b> <b>formula.</b> As an application, we obtain the generating function and the asymptotic formula for the number of ribbon plane partitions, which can be viewed as plane partitions "shifted at the two sides".
