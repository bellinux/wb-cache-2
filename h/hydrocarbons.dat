30|$|We {{highlight}} {{here that}} the <b>hydrocarbon</b> accumulation limit is not a threshold indicating the existence of <b>hydrocarbon.</b> When <b>hydrocarbon</b> exists in reservoirs below this limit, it was probably accumulated before entering the threshold, below which there may be exploration risks because the strata porosity is low and accumulation has terminated. There may be <b>hydrocarbon</b> (liquid oil) reservoirs of industrial value in strata with a burial depth of 6, 000  m, and even with a burial depth exceeding 8, 000  m in some basins in the world.

In this paper, the <b>hydrocarbon</b> accumulation system is evaluated quantitatively by establishing a hierarchy structure model based on an analytical hierarchy process. The <b>hydrocarbon</b> accumulation system of a higher exploration degree is selected as a calibration area and its <b>hydrocarbon</b> {{accumulation coefficient}} can be calculated using methods of <b>hydrocarbon</b> generation potential and reservoir-scale sequence. The <b>hydrocarbon</b> accumulation coefficient of a petroleum accumulation system can be gained by analogy of reservoir forming comprehensive evaluation results with the calibration area.

Determination of initial oil (gas) in place is based on <b>hydrocarbon</b> saturation, porosity and thickness obtained from openhole logging data for a given drainage area. It is important not only to determine the initial <b>hydrocarbon</b> in place, but also to define the existing <b>hydrocarbon</b> moveability, indicating the recoverable <b>hydrocarbon</b> and its type. This paper presents a new approach of <b>hydrocarbon</b> moveability factor (HCM). This factor is derived from shallow and deep resistivity data.

30|$|A {{number of}} beach-bar {{sandstone}} reservoir beds are {{developed in the}} upper fourth member of the Eocene Shahejie Formation (Es 4 s) on the southern slope of the Dongying Sag. Based on the analysis of seismic and logging data, with characterization and petrographic studies of core and cutting samples, this paper analyzes the <b>hydrocarbon</b> accumulation characteristics in two typical blocks of the Boxing and Wangjiagang oilfields, especially reservoir bed heterogeneity and migration conditions that influence oil and gas distribution, calculates the index of reservoir bed quality (IRQ) with a mathematical method, and discusses the relationship between driving force and resistance of <b>hydrocarbon</b> accumulation. Taking into account the characteristics of thin interbeds in beach-bar sandstones, an experimental model simulated the characteristics of <b>hydrocarbon</b> migration and accumulation in thin interbedded sandstones with reservoir bed heterogeneity. The results showed that <b>hydrocarbon</b> distribution and properties were extremely non-uniform. Reservoir bed and migration conditions controlled <b>hydrocarbon</b> accumulation in beach-bar sandstones. IRQ is above 0.4 in the main <b>hydrocarbon</b> region. Sand body distribution, structural configuration and fault systems controlled the direction of regional migration and location of <b>hydrocarbon</b> accumulation. Simulation experiments indicated that the change of driving force for <b>hydrocarbon</b> migration affected selective accumulation mechanisms. <b>Hydrocarbon</b> moved vertically along fault zones to the reservoir and resulted {{in the distribution of}} <b>hydrocarbon</b> in the reservoir. Two kinds of <b>hydrocarbon</b> accumulation models exist in the study area. One is a <b>hydrocarbon</b> accumulation model controlled by reservoir bed heterogeneity and the second is a <b>hydrocarbon</b> accumulation model controlled by a complex migration system with faults connecting sandbodies. Finally, different exploration strategies should be adopted for the detailed exploration for beach-bar sandstone reservoirs according to different geological backgrounds.|$|R

30|$|The {{geologic}} {{conditions of}} superimposed basins in China are very complicated. This is mainly shown by multi-phase structural evolution, multiple sets of source-reservoir-cap rock combinations, multiple stages of <b>hydrocarbon</b> generation and expulsion from source rocks, multi-cycle <b>hydrocarbon</b> enrichment and accumulation, and multi-phase reservoir adjustment and reconstruction. The enrichment, accumulation {{and distribution of}} <b>hydrocarbon</b> is mainly controlled by the source rock kitchen, paleoanticline, regional cap rock and intensity of tectonic movement. In this paper, the T-BCMS model has been developed to predict favorable areas of <b>hydrocarbon</b> accumulation in complicated superimposed basins according to time and spatial relationships among five key factors. The five factors include unconformity surface representing tectonic balancing (B), regional cap rock representing <b>hydrocarbon</b> protection (C), paleo-anticline representing <b>hydrocarbon</b> migration and accumulation (M), source rock kitchen representing <b>hydrocarbon</b> generation and expulsion (S) and geological time (T). There are three necessary conditions to form favorable areas of <b>hydrocarbon</b> accumulation. First, four key factors BCMS should be strictly {{in the order of}} BCMS from top to bottom. Second, superimposition of four key factors BCMS in the same area is the most favorable for <b>hydrocarbon</b> accumulation. Third, vertically ordered combination and superimposition in the same area of BCMS should occur at the same geological time. The model has been used to predict the most favorable exploration areas in Ordovician in the Tarim Basin in the main <b>hydrocarbon</b> accumulation periods.
