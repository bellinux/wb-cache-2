5|$|Karluk left Esquimalt on 17 June 1913, sailing north towards Alaska. The <b>immediate</b> <b>destination</b> was Nome, on {{the coast}} of the Bering Sea. There was trouble from the {{beginning}} with the steering gear and with the engines, both of which needed frequent attention. On 2 July Karluk reached the Bering Sea in mist, fog and rapidly falling temperatures; six days later she arrived at Nome where she joined Alaska and Mary Sachs. While the ships were being loaded in Nome, some of the scientists pressed for a meeting with the leader to clarify plans, particularly with regard to the Northern Party whose schedule was vague. The meeting was unsatisfactory. Stefansson's attitude offended several of the men, some of whom threatened to leave the expedition. They had read press reports in which Stefansson had apparently said that he expected Karluk to be crushed, and that the lives of the staff were secondary to the scientific work. Stefansson would not explain these matters, nor give further details of his plans for the Northern Party. Despite the scientists' alarm and dissatisfaction, none resigned.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the methodology to estimate {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) statistics by type of economic activity and country. The Central Bank of Chile compiles and prepares FDI statistics under the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position´s Framework (International Monetary Fund guidelines). Knowing where investment comes from and where Chilean investment is going to provides us with bilateral information useful to those responsible for economic policy, academics, investors and the general public. Similarly, studying investment sectors allows us to show which productive sectors attract capital investment. Given the importance of foreign direct investment in Chile and Chilean direct investment abroad, this study’s main objective is to explain the methodology used to estimate the series of flows and stocks of direct investment, broken down according to their origin or <b>immediate</b> geographic <b>destination</b> and the economic sector receiving the investment, and to present {{the results for the}} 2006 - 2009 period.

60|$|When George Hotspur left Humblethwaite, {{turned out}} of the house by the angry Baronet early in the morning,--as the reader will remember,--he was at his own desire driven to Penrith, {{choosing}} to go south rather than north. He had doubted for a while as to his <b>immediate</b> <b>destination.</b> The Altringhams were still at Castle Corry, and he might have received great comfort from her ladyship's advice and encouragement. But, intimate as he was with the Altringhams, he did not dare to take a liberty with the Earl. A certain allowance of splendid hospitality at Castle Corry was at his disposal every year, and Lord Altringham always welcomed him with thorough kindness. But George Hotspur had in some fashion been made to understand that he was not to overstay his time; and he was quite aware that the Earl could be very disagreeable upon occasions. There was a something in the Earl of which George was afraid; and, to tell the truth, he did not dare to go back to Castle Corry. And then, might it not be well for him to make immediate preparation in London for those inquiries respecting his debts and his character which Sir Harry had decided to make? It would be very difficult for him to make any preparation {{that could lead to a}} good result; but if no preparation were made, the result would be very bad indeed. It might perhaps be possible to do something with Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber. He had no other immediate engagements. In October he was due to shoot pheasants with a distinguished party in Norfolk, but this business which he had now in hand was of so much importance that even the pheasant-shooting and the distinguished party were not of much moment to him.|$|E
6000|$|There was a postilion, in {{the course}} of this day's journey, as wild and savagely good-looking a {{vagabond}} as you would desire to see. He was a tall, stout-made, dark-complexioned fellow, with a profusion of shaggy black hair hanging all over his face, and great black whiskers stretching down his throat. His dress was a torn suit of rifle green, garnished here and there with red; a steeple- crowned hat, innocent of nap, with a broken and bedraggled feather stuck in the band; and a flaming red neckerchief hanging on his shoulders. He was not in the saddle, but reposed, quite at his ease, on a sort of low foot-board in front of the postchaise, down amongst the horses' tails--convenient for having his brains kicked out, at any moment. To this Brigand, the brave Courier, when we were at a reasonable trot, happened to suggest the practicability of going faster. He received the proposal with a perfect yell of derision; brandished his whip about his head (such a whip! it was more like a home-made bow); flung up his heels, much higher than the horses; and disappeared, in a paroxysm, somewhere in the neighbourhood of the axle-tree. I fully expected to see him lying in the road, a hundred yards behind, but up came the steeple- crowned hat again, next minute, and he was seen reposing, as on a sofa, entertaining himself with the idea, and crying, 'Ha, ha! what next! Oh the devil! Faster too! Shoo--hoo--o--o!' (This last ejaculation, an inexpressibly defiant hoot.) Being anxious to reach our <b>immediate</b> <b>destination</b> that night, I ventured, by-and-by, to repeat the experiment on my own account. It produced exactly the same effect. Round flew the whip with the same scornful flourish, up came the heels, down went the steeple-crowned hat, and presently he reappeared, reposing as before and saying to himself, 'Ha ha! what next! Faster too! Oh the devil! Shoo--hoo--o--o!' ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper proposes an {{analysis}} of North Korean ports {{in the light of}} existing models and cases of port system evolution. In particular, it reviews the economical and political factors shaping port concentration in developed, developing, and socialist countries. A database on vessel movements allows for the analysis of individual North Korean port traffic by total capacity circulated, cargo type, fleet nationality, <b>immediate</b> origin and <b>destination,</b> and berthing time between 1985 and 2005. On the one hand, results confirm broader trends such as geopolitical change from socialist trade to isolation, and new inter-Korean relations. On the other hand, the geography of North Korean port traffic combines elements of both socialist and developing countries. While ideological factors and military control hamper port modernization and trade openness, traffic concentration at the Pyongyang-Nampo gateway highlights the gradual precedence taken by economical factors over political factors.

40|$|Higher {{education}} is historically {{rooted in a}} model of learning based in the Humanities in which literate, critical, and communication skills are a recognised public good. These skills and the public values they serve – such as the capacity for making informed choices, for evaluating evidence and argument, for creative thought and problem-solving –are widely recognised as much more than economic means and ends. However, the need to demonstrate the impact and value of Humanities higher education to society and the economy has intensified during the recent period of economic crisis. It {{is important to consider}} not only the intrinsic value of Humanities in higher education, but also the ways in which these subject areas are responsive to economic change and how the knowledge and skills they provide make a major contribution to the UK economy and society. The lack of substantial data and evidence on the contribution of Humanities graduates to the economy and society needs to be addressed. The statistical profile of Humanities graduates, combined with in-depth interviews on their life courses, as presented in this report, are steps toward providing this evidence base. The evidence collected here demonstrates that the long- established system of Humanities-based higher education in Oxford has proven highly responsive to national economic needs. While this is a pilot project focusing on a single university and restricted to Humanities graduates, it provides a methodology that could lead to additional studies of other UK universities as well as graduate contributions in the sciences and social sciences. The research project consists of a quantitative study of 11, 000 individual Humanities graduates who matriculated at University of Oxford between 1960 and 1989 (Part I) and a qualitative study tracking the lifelong career history up to the present day of a sample of those graduates (Part II).
