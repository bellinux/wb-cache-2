500|$|Madonna {{planning}} to perform [...] "Frozen" [...] in Werchter? I didn't expect anything else, you know. I don't even mind. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>would</b> be nice because I would finally {{get some money}} after all these years, because the case is still going on. I'm {{certainly not going to}} the concert. My lawyer is following the case. I'm really going to follow Madonna's concert with interest, because she really can't perform the song. Yet, I think we won't immediately take steps. The court's decision is subject to various interpretations. The song can't be played on the radio or be sold, but have we arguments enough for the concert to be over? We won't bring additional spectacle to the show. Unnecessary scandals, with Madonna it's guaranteed.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} July, Wilson {{left the}} film because of {{scheduling}} conflicts {{brought on by the}} filming delay, and characters being played by Gerald and Kevin Weisman were cut in McKay's revised script. Also, Reed indicated that in addition to Georgia, filming would take place in San Francisco. The next month, Reed revealed that Scott Lang's daughter would appear in the film, and Gabriel Ferrari and Andrew Barrer were hired to make further revisions to the script. Eric Pearson, a member of Marvel Studios' writing program who had written the Marvel One-Shot films, did uncredited work on the film as well. After reading the revised script, Evangeline Lilly felt that the film was [...] "pulled" [...] more into the MCU than Wright's version which [...] "was much more in the Edgar Wright camp of films." [...] She added that, while Wright's version was [...] "incredible" [...] and would have been great to film and watch, [...] "it wouldn't have fit in the Marvel Universe. It would have stuck out like a sore thumb, no matter how good it was. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>would</b> have taken you away from this cohesive universe they're trying to create. And therefore it ruins the suspended disbelief that they've built." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later that night, Alice and Tony {{come back}} very late from their date {{and have a}} glass of wine and Tony makes a toast. Though it is {{revealed}} that they both love each other very, very much, Alice has doubts as to whether a marriage of Tony and Alice's families could ever work out well. Tony insists that, if they love each other, it shouldn't matter, but Alice ignores him and tearfully shouts that <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>would</b> never work. She divulges how Grandpa could have been [...] "a very rich man," [...] but instead, he had an epiphany one day and rode the elevator right back down to the lobby of his building and quit work. Alice explains that her family is too odd to get along with any other.|$|E

6000|$|Owen {{held her}} hand very firmly and kept it even after an effort made by her to recover it--an effort not repeated, as she felt it best not to show she was flurried. That solution--of her living with him at Ricks--{{disposed}} of him beautifully, and disposed not less so of herself; it disposed admirably too of Mrs. Gereth. Fleda could only vainly wonder how it provided for poor Mona. While he looked at her, grasping her hand, she felt that now indeed she was paying for his mother's extravagance at Poynton--the vividness of that lady's public plea that little Fleda Vetch was the person to insure the general peace. It was to that vividness poor Owen had come back, and if Mrs. Gereth had had more discretion little Fleda Vetch wouldn't {{have been in a}} predicament. She saw that Owen had at this moment his sharpest necessity of speech, and so long as he didn't release her hand she could only submit to him. Her defense would be perhaps to look blank and hard; so she looked as blank and as hard as she could, with the reward of an immediate sense {{that this was not a}} bit what he wanted. It even made him hang fire, as if he were suddenly ashamed of himself, were recalled to some idea of duty and of honor. Yet he none the less brought it out. [...] "There's one thing I dare say I ought to tell you, if you're going so kindly to act for me; though of course you'll see for yourself it's a thing it won't do to tell her." [...] What was it? He made her wait for it again, and while she waited, under firm coercion, she had the extraordinary impression that Owen's simplicity was in eclipse. His natural honesty was like the scent of a flower, and she felt at this moment as if her nose had been brushed by the bloom without the odor. The allusion was undoubtedly to his mother; and was not what he meant about the matter in question the opposite of what he said--that <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>would</b> do to tell her? It would have been the first time he had said the opposite of what he meant, and there was certainly a fascination in the phenomenon, as well as a challenge to suspense in the ambiguity. [...] "It's just that I understand from Mona, you know," [...] he stammered; [...] "it's just that she has made no bones about bringing home to me--" [...] He tried to laugh, and in the effort he faltered again.|$|E

Before the game was released, several early screenshots depicted Banjo and Kazooie flying and another featuring an industrial world of some sort. This world was known as 'Fiery Furnace', but was shrunk and added as a sub-area of Freezing Furnace called 'Grunty Industries' in the final game. In Scribes, Leigh Loveday said that the ability for Banjo and Kazooie to fly was removed because <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>would</b> not have worked out in the game.|$|E

In an interview from the Clerks II DVD, Smith noted [...] "All these people were just trashing this movie's stars instead {{of looking at the}} movie itself.

5000|$|In November 2005, a Belgian judge {{seated in}} Mons {{ruled that the}} opening four-bar theme to [...] "Frozen" [...] was plagiarized from the song [...] "Ma vie fout le camp" [...] ("My Life's Getting Nowhere"), {{composed}} by Salvatore Acquaviva. The judge subsequently ordered the withdrawal from sales of all remaining discs, and forbade any further playing of the song on Belgian TV and radio. The judge also ordered Warner Bros., EMI and Sony to spread the decision within fifteen days to media outlets on pain of a penalty of €125,000 for non-compliance with the court order. Acquaviva's lawyer, Victor Vicent Dehin, said: [...] "We tried to reach a friendly agreement... but they didn't want to negotiate so I sued for plagiarism. They have stolen a song, {{so they have to}} pay the value of the song." [...] No award damages for the song were granted. Salvatore Acquaviva had explained to the court that Madonna heard [...] "Ma vie fout l'camp" [...] during a trip to Mouscron in the late 1970s. She had been recruited to be a dancer during a tour with French singer Patrick Hernandez, whose discs were produced in Mouscron. Dehin also stated that the lawsuit was just the first step, and the next discussion would be about the copyright gains Madonna obtained with [...] "Frozen". Subsequently, the song was omitted from the track listing on the Belgian pressings of Celebration in 2009. However, Madonna performed the song during the Sticky & Sweet Tour in Werchter, with Bert Bieseman, marketing manager of Belgian branch of Warner Bros. stating that [...] "Madonna is not afraid of a more or less riot". Acquaviva commented about the case:Madonna planning to perform [...] "Frozen" [...] in Werchter? I didn't expect anything else, you know. I don't even mind. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>would</b> be nice because I would finally get some money after all these years, because the case is still going on. I'm certainly not going to the concert.

The court's decision is subject to various interpretations. The song can't be played on the radio or be sold, but have we arguments enough for the concert to be over? We won't bring additional spectacle to the show. Unnecessary scandals, with Madonna it's guaranteed.In February 2014, a Belgian court repealed the verdict on the case and proclaimed that Madonna did not plagiarize Acquaviva's work for [...] "Frozen". The court spoke of a [...] "new capital offense" [...] in the file: composer Edouard Scotto Di Suoccio and societies Tabata Atoll Music and Music in Paris had also filed a complaint for plagiarism. According to them, both [...] "Ma vie fout le camp" [...] and [...] "Frozen" [...] originated in the song [...] "Blood Night" [...] which they composed in 1983. After all three tracks in the case were compared, the final ruling was that the songs were [...] "not sufficiently 'original' to claim" [...] that any plagiarism had taken place. This ruling ended the eight-year ban of the song that was in place in Belgium since 2005.|$|E
