5|$|Adam Cleveland at IGN called Revelations: The Demon Slayer a fun but not {{innovative}} game. The American game magazine Nintendo Power did however find it innovative; for instance, they {{cited the}} automatic battle option. Cleveland disliked the monster conversation system, which he found irritating; {{he said that}} players never know what answer they should give a monster, and that the questions the monsters ask feel monotone due to <b>how</b> <b>often</b> <b>they</b> are repeated. Writers for the Japanese game magazine Famitsu thought the monster fusion system was fun. In their review of Last Bible III, they commented on how different the game is from the Megami Tensei series, and instead compared it to Final Fantasy. Kurt Kalata and Christopher J. Snelgrove wrote for Hardcore Gaming 101 that while The Demon Slayer was {{not by any means}} an outstanding game, it was one of few competent role-playing games on Game Boy. They found Last Bible III to be the best game in the series.|$|E

Subjective well-being is defined as feeling pleasant emotions or having pleasant experiences. To assess well-being, participants complete measures of <b>how</b> <b>often</b> <b>they</b> feel positive emotions (an affective measure), <b>how</b> <b>often</b> <b>they</b> feel negative emotions (an affective measure), and how satisfied they are with their lives (a cognitive measure).

25|$|A {{secondary}} {{analysis of}} a series of surveys conducted for the AAUW and administered to a representative sample of 2,064 8th through 11th-grade American students in 2000 showed that 9.6% of the students reported educator sex abuse. The students were asked if and <b>how</b> <b>often</b> <b>they</b> had experienced 14 types of behaviors which constitute sexual harassment. They then indicated who harassed them (students, teachers, school employees). Nonphysical sexual abuse (e.g., making sexual jokes) was more prevalent than physical abuse (8.7 and 6.7%). Girls {{were more likely to report}} educator sexual harassment than boys (10.3 and 8.8%). 12.3% of black, 12.2% of Latino, 8.4% of white and 1,8 % of Asian students indicated that they had experienced sexual harassment by teachers.|$|E
25|$|In cricket, a player's {{batting average}} {{is the total}} number of runs they have scored divided by the number of times they have been out. Since the number of runs a player scores and <b>how</b> <b>often</b> <b>they</b> get out are {{primarily}} measures of their own playing ability, and largely independent of their teammates, batting average is a good metric for an individual player's skill as a batsman. The number is also simple to interpret intuitively. If all the batsman's innings were completed (i.e. they were out every innings), this is the average number of runs they score per innings. If they did not complete all their innings (i.e. some innings they finished not out), this number is an estimate of the unknown average number of runs they score per innings. Batting average has been used to gauge cricket players' relative skills since the 18th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{information}} in DNA {{is held in}} the sequence of the repeating units along the DNA chain. These units are four types of nucleotides (A,T,G and C) and the sequence of nucleotides stores {{information in}} an alphabet called the genetic code. When a gene is read by a cell the DNA sequence is copied into a very similar molecule called RNA (this process is called transcription). Transcription is controlled by other DNA sequences (such as promoters), which show a cell where genes are, and control <b>how</b> <b>often</b> <b>they</b> are copied. The RNA copy made from a gene is then fed through a structure called a ribosome, which translates the sequence of nucleotides in the RNA into the correct sequence of amino acids and joins these amino acids {{together to make a}} complete protein chain. The new protein then folds up into its active form. The process of moving information from the language of RNA into the language of amino acids is called translation.|$|E

An urge incontinence index is constructed by two questions: <b>How</b> <b>often</b> and to what extent is urge incontinence experienced? Urge incontinence index 0 means that the woman is not urge incontinent. Urge incontinence index 8 (the highest possible) means that the woman experiences a sudden and imperious need to void, and urinary leakage before she reaches the toilet more than once per day, and that the urine runs down her legs or onto the floor. Four items constructed the quality of life index: (1) How many pads are used? (2) <b>How</b> <b>often</b> do <b>they</b> avoid activities due to fear of leakage? (3) <b>How</b> <b>often</b> do <b>they</b> avoid places or situations due to fear of no toilet available? and (4) How does leakage influence vacations, family life, social life, and sleep?

2500|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} facing the church is to retain the registered, tax-paying members (regardless of <b>how</b> <b>often</b> <b>they</b> attend services) to fund parishes and church agencies, especially its international relief organizations like Adveniat. German Roman Catholics, however, are divided over the issue of a compulsory Church tax. Under the tax an additional 8 percent to 9 percent of personal income tax is deducted at source by the German state from registered churchgoers (of Catholic and Protestant communities). [...] Although the tax provides the Catholic and Lutheran churches with an exact membership count and a net income of 5.6 billion euros (in 2008) which has helped make the German Roman Catholic Church one of the wealthiest in the world, it forces out or excommunicates Catholics who wish to retain membership but do not want to pay the tax. Many Catholics favour leaving the system intact because it pays the salaries of thousands of church employees and contributes to the work of aid agencies such as Caritas, among others. Other Catholics say members should not have to be forced out of the church or excommunicated simply because they don't want to pay the Church tax.|$|E

The provisions require the SEC to implement rules that require proxy statements for shareholder meetings {{to include a}} vote for shareholders to approve executive compensation by voting on [...] "say on pay" [...] and [...] "golden parachutes." [...] SEC regulations require that at least once every three years shareholders have a non-binding say-on-pay vote on executive compensation. While shareholder are required to have a say-on-pay vote at least every three years, they can also elect to vote annually, every two years, or every third year. The regulations also require that shareholders have a vote at least every six years to decide <b>how</b> <b>often</b> <b>they</b> {{would like to have}} say-on-pay votes. In addition, companies are required to disclose any golden parachute compensation that may be paid out to executives {{in the case of a}} merger, acquisition, or sale of major assets.

Although these votes are non-binding and do not take precedence over the decisions of the board, failure to give the results of votes due consideration can cause negative shareholder reactions. Regulations covering these requirements were implemented in January 2011 and took effect in April 2011.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{getting the}} job of director, Watts created images of Nick Fury as Parker's mentor in the story in early [...] "mood reels" [...] saying, [...] "I don’t know what the {{situation}} would be, {{but that would be}} a person he’d want to get in trouble with."

[...] He also said that the film hoped to use one of Spider-Man's rogues that have not been seen in film yet, and that filming would begin in June 2016. In July 2015, it was reported that Marisa Tomei had been offered the role of May Parker, Peter's aunt. It was also revealed that Daley and Goldstein, after missing out on the director role, had begun negotiations to write the screenplay, and were given three days to present Marvel with their pitch; both confirmed shortly after that they had reached a deal to write the screenplay.

[...] The writers also wanted to avoid the skyscrapers of Manhattan because of <b>how</b> <b>often</b> <b>they</b> were used in the other films, and instead wrote the character into locations such as [...] "the suburbs, on a golf course, the Staten Island Ferry, Coney Island, and even Washington D.C."
