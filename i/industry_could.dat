5|$|But {{daunting}} {{technical problems}} remained. Raeder wanted newer planes, {{specifically designed for}} carrier use. Reichsmarshall Hermann Göring, head of the Luftwaffe, replied that the already overburdened German aircraft <b>industry</b> <b>could</b> not possibly complete the design, testing and mass production of such aircraft before 1946. Instead, he proposed converting existing aircraft (again the Junkers Ju 87 and Messerschmitt Bf 109) as a temporary solution until newer types could be developed. Training of carrier pilots at Travemünde would also resume.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} weeks before the election, the issue of Chinese {{immigration}} entered the race. Both major parties (as well as the Greenbackers) pledged in their platforms to limit immigration from China, which native-born workers in the Western states believed was depressing their wages. On October 20, however, a Democratic newspaper published a letter, purportedly from Garfield {{to a group of}} businessmen, pledging to keep immigration at the current levels so that <b>industry</b> <b>could</b> keep workers' wages low. Garfield denounced the letter as a ruse, but not before one hundred thousand copies of the newspaper were mailed to California and Oregon. Once the letter was exposed as a forgery, Garfield biographer Peskin believes it may even have gained votes for the Republican in the East, but it likely weakened him in the West.|$|E

5|$|When the United States {{entered the}} war in 1917, General John J. Pershing sent Brice P. Disque, a former army captain, to the Pacific Northwest to {{determine}} if local labor issues within the forest products <b>industry</b> <b>could</b> be quickly resolved. Disque met with mill owners {{and representatives of the}} Industrial Workers of the World, the union that was trying to organize loggers and sawmill workers in the Pacific Northwest. After studying the situation for several months, Disque determined that the long-standing labor management dispute could not be resolved without direct intervention by the army. Based on Disque's report, the United States Army Signal Corps was given the job of reorganizing the forest products industry in the Pacific Northwest to support United States war production.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} arm of {{the lake}} has a much higher salinity, {{to the point that}} the native brine shrimp cannot survive in its waters. In the southern portion, where the vast majority of the fresh water inlets are found, the salt level can dip below what is necessary for the brine shrimp to survive, while water in the northern bay is too salty. The salinity of northern {{arm of the}} lake will likely drop as lower salinity from the southern arm of the lake flows into the northern arm. The brine shrimp harvesting <b>industry</b> <b>could</b> benefit from the causeway allowing a freer flow of water. There were concerns from the brine shrimp harvesting industry that the lake conditions in the southern arm of the lake were becoming too saline for the brine shrimp due to several years of lower precipitation in the lake's watershed. The precipitation in the watershed has been above normal for the current water year that begins its tracking October 1, 2016. This additional precipitation has allowed the levels of both arms of the lake to rise, and at least for the near future the conditions for a healthy brine shrimp population seem good.|$|E

25|$|For production, various {{portions}} of the aircraft were subcontracted to Sud Aviation (wings and rear fuselage) and Breguet Aviation(tailfin), which was still a separate company from Dassault until 1967; Dassault manufactured the front fuselage and flight-control system internally. Manufacture of both the prototypes and subsequent production aircraft was often hindered by an explicit requirement {{that there would be}} no reliance upon foreign suppliers to maintain France's nuclear capabilities; due to this, the Mirage IV initially lacked an inertial navigation system as French <b>industry</b> <b>could</b> not initially produce this device.|$|E
25|$|The first {{offshore}} wells {{drilled in}} the Beaufort used artificial islands as drilling platforms, {{but this was}} a winter drilling system, and was only practical in shallow water. In the mid-1970s, the introduction of a fleet of reinforced drillships extended the drilling season to include the 90 to 120 ice-free days of summer. This also enabled the industry to drill in the deeper waters of the Beaufort Sea. By the mid-1980s, variations on artificial island and drilling vessel technologies had extended both the drilling season and the depth of water at which the <b>industry</b> <b>could</b> operate. They had also reduced exploration costs.|$|E
