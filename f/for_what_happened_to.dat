5|$|The {{other main}} match {{on the card}} was a Hardcore Intergender match, as Edge and Mick Foley faced Terry Funk and Tommy Dreamer. The rivalry started between Edge and Foley, when the two faced in a Hardcore match at WrestleMania 22. Edge won the match after a spear off the apron and through a flaming table on the outside. Foley was a guest on the Cutting Edge on the May 1, 2006 episode of Raw, and the two agreed to a WrestleMania Hardcore rematch the {{following}} week. Before the match began on the May 8, 2006 edition of Raw, Foley announced that the match was now a triple threat match, with Tommy Dreamer added as the third person. During the match, however, Foley turned heel {{for the first time}} in over eight years and attacked Dreamer with a barbed wire baseball bat. Foley handed Edge the bat and Edge hit Dreamer with it, busting him open. Foley hit the Mandible claw on Dreamer and Edge simultaneously speared Dreamer, with Foley getting the pinfall. The two, along with Lita celebrated up the entrance ramp. On the May 15, 2006 episode of Raw, Foley wanted to apologize to Dreamer for what happened the previous week; however, Dreamer was not in the arena, so Foley brought out Terry Funk. Funk asked Foley to apologize <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Dreamer. Instead, Foley started bashing ECW. In an attempt to get into a fight with Foley, Funk made comments about Foley's family, calling his wife a whore and his kids s. When the two exchanged punches, Edge and Lita came out, with Lita low-blowing Funk. Edge and Foley double-teamed Funk, with Edge hitting Funk with a barbed wire baseball bat. A week later, on the May 22, 2006 edition of Raw, Edge and Foley announced themselves as co-holders of the WWE Hardcore Championship. Paul Heyman came out and made a challenge to Edge and Foley to face Funk and Dreamer at One Night Stand, which Edge accepted. The two, along with Lita, went after Heyman up the ramp, before Dreamer and Funk attacked them with several weapons, sending the trio out of the arena. On the WWE vs. ECW Head to Head special that aired on June 7, 2006, Edge faced Dreamer in an Extreme Rules match. Dreamer hit Edge with a Dreamer Driver through the table. Lita interfered, and hit Dreamer repeatedly with a cane. Dreamer was not hurt by the shots, and he got Lita up for a powerbomb, before Edge speared Dreamer. Edge got the pinfall and won the match. During the match, Foley and Funk were fighting outside the ring, with Funk busting Foley open. After the match, Foley sat in the middle of the ring and stated his kayfabe thoughts on ECW.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} stages of the war between AAA and La Sociedad, Cibernético was one of the top técnicos {{fighting}} for AAA. On October 1, 2010, at Héroes Inmortales IV, he was scheduled to team up Heavy Metal, La Parka and Octagón against a team of La Sociedad representatives, but prior to the match Konnan announced that Cibernético had decided to turn his back on AAA and join his team instead. AAA bought Konnan's claim and replaced Cibernético and Octagón, who was injured in a backstage assault by someone resembling Cibernético, in the match with Dark Ozz and Dark Cuervo. However, in the end Cibernético interfered in the match and helped AAA pick up the win. Afterwards, Cibernético, upset with AAA and in particular his friend La Parka for believing he had turned on the company, decided to re–form his old group Los Bizarros with Amadeus, Escoria, Nygma and Taboo. Cibernético made clear that even though Los Bizarros were no longer with AAA, they were not part of La Sociedad either, solidifying the group's status as tweeners. He also tried to recruit his friend El Mesías to join the group, but he decided to stay out of the war of words between his two friends. On November 22, the feud between Cibernético and La Parka turned physical, when Los Bizarros ran out to save El Mesías from a beatdown at the hands of La Sociedad, without making the save for La Parka and Jack Evans. When Parka confronted Cibernético, he was laid out with a stunner, after which Los Bizarros beat him down and Cibernético ripped his mask off his face. The first major battle between Cibernético and La Parka took place on December 5, 2010, at Guerra de Titanes, where Parka teamed up with Dark Espíritu, Extreme Tiger and Jack Evans to defeat Cibernético, Escoria, Nygma and Taboo. After the match, Los Bizarros once again beat down La Parka, after which Cibernético admitted that while Super Fly had been outed as the man who had attacked Octagón prior to Héroes Inmortales IV, he was in fact the one who had orchestrated the attack, meaning that Parka had been right about him all along. He then introduced the returning Charly Manson, who had most recently worked for rival promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), as the newest member of Los Bizarros. The group's lineup would be finalized a couple of months later with the addition of Billy el Malo, who jumped to Los Bizarros from La Sociedad. Cibernético and La Parka continued their heated rivalry the following months during which it was implied that Cibernético had assaulted and hospitalized Parka's three-year-old son, his own godson, with a broken leg and even provided X-rays, which he used to taunt Parka with. At March's Rey de Reyes, Los Bizarros, represented by Cibernético, Billy el Malo, Escoria and Nygma defeated La Parka, Jack Evans, Joe Líder and Nicho el Millonario, after which Cibernético threatened to light Parka on fire, before being driven out of the ring by Nicho. In May, La Parka formed his own group El Inframundo ("The Underworld") with Dark Ozz, Dark Cuervo, Dark Espíritu and the recently debuted Drago to counteract Los Bizarros. On May 13, La Parka challenged Cibernético to a battle of the groups at Triplemanía XIX, which he accepted. It was later revealed that for the event Parka's team would be joined by Octagón, looking for revenge <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> him nine months earlier. During the event, Octagón would also become the fifth inductee into the AAA Hall of Fame, following in the footsteps of Antonio Peña, Rey Mysterio Jr., Eddie Guerrero and Pepe Casas.|$|E
