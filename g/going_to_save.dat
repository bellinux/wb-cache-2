Contributing something positive doesn’t have to be a lifelong commitment; it can just be daily gestures. So, it was about giving the whole issue perspective... One video and a message aren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> everything. But when you say things together, maybe the message will be heard and hopefully will provoke action.
