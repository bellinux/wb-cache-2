5|$|Stela 16 was {{dedicated}} in 711, {{during the reign}} of Jasaw Chan K'awiil I. The sculpture, including a portrait of the king and a hieroglyphic text, are limited to the <b>front</b> <b>face</b> of the monument. It was found in Complex N, west of Temple III.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} easily {{distinguishable}} from other Chinese hares, having longer ears than the South Chinese Hare. Like the Woolly hare (Lepus oiostolus) and the South Chinese hare, {{an examination of}} the skull shows the groove on the <b>front</b> <b>face</b> of the upper incisors is filled with cement.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} the N, N1 and K class locomotives, the Midland Railway {{influence}} of Clayton showed in the placement of locomotive fittings on the production batch, as the water top-feed into the boiler was located inside a dome, whilst the cab area was {{a modified version of}} those on the 0-6-0s of Henry Fowler and the K class rebuilds. The rebuilds had Midland Railway-style double spectacle plates (the small windows on the <b>front</b> <b>face</b> of the cab) left over from the K class cabs, whereas the production versions had one each side of the boiler. Such modifications were becoming typical of the Southern Railway’s attempt to produce a fleet of standardised locomotives. However, all members of the U class were to vary from GWR practice, as the superheating surface area was increased, and all were equipped with outside Walschaerts valve gear.|$|E

5|$|In one of {{earliest}} Vaikuntha Chaturmurti images {{dating from}} the Gupta era - c. 6th century (now housed in Mathura Museum), {{the positions of the}} boar and lion heads are reversed, though this is a rare aberration. The central <b>front</b> <b>face</b> may be smiling. Sometimes, the back face may be omitted. The fourth head may be replaced by a horse (Hayagriva, another avatar of Vishnu) or a Chakrapurusha (the personified Sudarshana Chakra - the discus weapon of Vishnu). The kapila head may have a moustache, bulging large eyes, a third eye, grinning teeth, fangs, a short chin, broad eyebrows and a ferocious, grim or sad expression. His hair are generally tied up in a large knot - a jata (matted hair) like a sage; rarely he may wear a crown.|$|E
5|$|The south (<b>front)</b> <b>face</b> of {{the eastern}} wing has seven bays, with a balustraded parapet at eaves level. The central bay is set forward to form a stone centrepiece around the arched main {{entrance}}, which is flanked by fluted Ionic columns. Immediately above the entrance are doubled tapering pilasters flanking a three-light window, all surmounted by a large cartouche decorated with strapwork. On {{the first floor of}} the central bay is a triple-mullion window, and above the parapet is a coat of arms. Flanking the centrepiece are two bays with diapered brickwork and single-mullion windows. The two ends of the south face are also set forward; they have canted, triple-mullion bay windows and are surmounted above the parapet by shaped gables with attic windows. All the main windows of this face are double transomed.|$|E
5|$|The western {{half of the}} {{building}} is stepped forward (southwards) by two bays from the original building. Originally the service wing, it is plainer than the eastern building and dates from the Georgian era. Though using Georgian proportions, {{it was built in}} an early Jacobean revival style which has been heightened by subsequent alterations, particularly the addition of a central gable. The main part of the south (<b>front)</b> <b>face</b> has seven bays, with a balustraded parapet running along the entire façade at eaves level. In the centre of the five east bays is a canted bay window beneath a shaped gable; the flanking bays have single-mullion, double-transomed windows. The two west bays are set backwards and have a central oriel window on the first floor with two single-mullion, double-transomed windows on the ground floor.|$|E

25|$|During the knocking-in process, a {{fingernail}} {{is pressed}} into the <b>front</b> <b>face</b> of the bat to check if the bat is properly knocked in.

25|$|The Grande Punto in India {{went through}} a {{facelift}} changing the <b>front</b> <b>face</b> and a revised rear and giving it a more aggressive look and was named Punto Evo. This car also sports an SUV like ground clearance of 185mm for diesel and 195mm for petrol to suit Indian roads. In October 2014, Fiat India released the Avventura, which was a crossover variant of the Punto Evo.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} the <b>front</b> <b>face</b> was to {{position}} astronomical bodies {{with respect to the}} celestial sphere along the ecliptic, in reference to the observer's position on the Earth. That is irrelevant {{to the question of whether}} that position was computed using a heliocentric or geocentric view of the solar system; either computational method should, and does, result in the same position (ignoring ellipticity), within the error factors of the mechanism.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{imposing}} back entrance {{on the far}} side of the main hall with identical doors and windows, and which leads to a decorated ornamental patio-courtyard. Another balcony sits outside the back entrance but is connected to imposing angular staircases on either side with right-angled twists; instead of the spiral ones found on the <b>front</b> <b>face.</b> All the staircases and balconies are fenced with stylised pillar columns.|$|E

25|$|The Suffolk Square as {{its name}} {{suggests}} is unique to Suffolk. This is a square pillbox with walls of length 12ft 6in similar to a Type 26 but slightly larger; the walls are thin at 1ft 6in. They are most commonly shuttered with concrete blocks and have two embrasures in the <b>front</b> <b>face</b> with one each in the other faces. Some have a covered porch protecting the entrance. 37 examples of this type remain extant.|$|E
25|$|Behind {{the mold}} disk {{is the type}} metal pot, which {{contains}} molten type metal. A piston in the pot pushes the molten metal down into the pot, which forces the metal through the pot throat and into the mold, forcing it against {{the faces of the}} matrices. These have character shapes cut into them, so the result is a cast slug with the character shapes of the line on its <b>front</b> <b>face.</b> The mold disk is sometimes water-cooled, and often air-cooled with a blower, to carry away the heat of the molten type metal and allow the cast slugs to solidify quickly.|$|E
25|$|Mt. Calvary Baptist Church, 58 Alexander Street. Built in {{the late}} 1860s, {{this is the only}} {{remaining}} wood-frame church in the city of Albany. It is a two-story clapboard-sided building with a gabled roof that slopes slightly at either side of, creating broad overhanging eaves along the side elevations. On the north (<b>front)</b> <b>face,</b> it is met at the corners by slightly projecting wooden pilasters, suggesting a lingering Greek Revival influence. The lancet arched windows are complemented by a gabled front entrance porch. Atop is a small conical steeple with a wooden cross at its peak.|$|E

25|$|The {{sandstone}} memorial sits on {{a smooth}} faced base step which is surmounted by a larger step of sandstone blocks with tapered sides. On the <b>front</b> <b>face</b> {{of this is a}} marble plaque. The pedestal comprises a recessed square pillar with engaged columns at each corner. Each face bears a recessed marble plate with the leaded names of the 130 men who died. The columns have Composite order capitals and bases and support a large entablature. The frieze has relief carved festoons on each face and has a small dentil course under the cornice which is composed of cyma recta and cyma reversa mouldings.|$|E
25|$|The upper {{receiver}} {{can accept}} quick-detachable rails and adapters used to mount optics (STANAG 2324 compliant). The scope mounting system {{consists of a}} centering hole located on the <b>front</b> <b>face</b> of the rear sight assembly and a dovetail-like mounting point at {{the front end of}} the receiver. Swiss Arms (respectively Brügger & Thomet) offer several types of quick-release scope mounts and Picatinny rails. A version of the rifle with an integral receiver-mounted Picatinny rail is also offered; in this configuration the weapon is fitted with flip-up emergency battle sights—a rear aperture sight which folds down into a recess in the rail and a folding front blade.|$|E
25|$|The hottest {{points on}} any {{air-cooled}} engine are the cylinder heads, located around {{the circumference of}} a radial engine. In order to provide sufficient air to cool the engine, airflow had to be maximized at this outer edge. This was normally accomplished by leaving {{the majority of the}} <b>front</b> <b>face</b> of the engine open to the air, causing considerable drag. During the late 1920s, NACA led development of a dramatic improvement by placing an airfoil-shaped ring around the outside of the cylinder heads (the NACA cowling). The shaping accelerated the air as it entered the front of the cowl, increasing the total airflow, and allowing the opening in front of the engine to be made smaller.|$|E
