5|$|A related {{objection}} is that <b>evolution</b> <b>is</b> {{based on}} unreliable evidence, claiming that <b>evolution</b> <b>is</b> not even well-evidenced. Typically, this is either {{based on the}} argument that evolution's evidence is full of frauds and hoaxes, that current evidence for <b>evolution</b> <b>is</b> likely to be overturned as some past evidence has been, or that certain types of evidence are inconsistent and dubious.|$|E
5|$|A {{statement}} is considered falsifiable {{if there is}} an observation or a test that could be made that would demonstrate that the {{statement is}} false. Statements that are not falsifiable cannot be examined by scientific investigation since they permit no tests that evaluate their accuracy. Creationists such as Henry M. Morris have claimed that any observation can be fitted into the evolutionary framework, so it is impossible to demonstrate that <b>evolution</b> <b>is</b> wrong and therefore <b>evolution</b> <b>is</b> non-scientific.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the main}} sources of {{confusion}} and ambiguity in the creation–evolution debate {{is the definition of}} evolution itself. In the context of biology, <b>evolution</b> <b>is</b> genetic changes in populations of organisms over successive generations. The word also has a number of different meanings in different fields, from evolutionary computation to molecular evolution to sociocultural evolution to stellar and galactic evolution. When biological <b>evolution</b> <b>is</b> conflated with other evolutionary processes, this can cause errors such as the claim that modern evolutionary theory says anything about abiogenesis or the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|The {{arguments}} for evolution being a religion generally amount to arguments by analogy: {{it is argued}} that evolution and religion have one or more things in common, and that therefore <b>evolution</b> <b>is</b> a religion. Examples of claims made in such arguments are statements that <b>evolution</b> <b>is</b> based on faith, and that supporters of evolution dogmatically reject alternative suggestions out-of-hand. These claims have become more popular in recent years as the neo-creationist movement has sought to distance itself from religion, thus giving it more reason to make use of a seemingly anti-religious analogy.|$|E
5|$|A related {{argument}} against <b>evolution</b> <b>is</b> that most mutations are harmful. However, {{the vast majority}} of mutations are neutral, and the minority of mutations which are beneficial or harmful are often situational; a mutation that is harmful in one environment may be helpful in another.|$|E

5|$|Assuming for the {{purposes}} of argument, however, that <b>evolution</b> <b>is</b> a religion or religious tenet, the remedy is to stop the teaching of evolution, not establish another religion in opposition to it.

5|$|Scientists and U.S. {{courts have}} {{rejected}} this objection {{on the grounds}} that science is not based on appeals to popularity, but on evidence.

5|$|The {{opposite}} of convergence is divergent evolution, where related species evolve different traits. Convergent <b>evolution</b> <b>is</b> similar to but different from parallel evolution.
