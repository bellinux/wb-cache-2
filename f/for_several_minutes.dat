5|$|At age seventy-seven, Barbree {{is one of}} the longest-serving network correspondents to work {{continuously}} on {{a single}} subject. He started working for NBC on July 21, 1958 covering the space program, and continues in that capacity to the present. He has never missed a mission launch, despite suffering a heart attack while jogging along Cocoa Beach in 1987, and being declared clinically dead <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>minutes.</b> Following his heart attack, he had bypass surgery, and still did not miss any launches.|$|E
5|$|Another shootout {{occurred}} between Henry Clark and Sykes Griffen on December 1, 1878, at Cassidy's Silver Reef Saloon. Although {{it is not}} known exactly what happened, it is believed that Griffen, a faro dealer at the saloon, and Clark, a regular patron, had previously argued over gambling matters. The shooting began when Griffen argued with Clark about a bet they had made. After arguing <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>minutes,</b> Griffen pulled a pistol on Clark and shot him. Several witnesses said that Clark pulled a pistol on Griffen and shot him, while other witnesses said that after Clark was shot, other patrons in the saloon, including Clark's father, beat and shot Griffen.|$|E

5|$|Atomic nitrogen, {{also known}} as active nitrogen, is highly reactive, being a triradical with three {{unpaired}} electrons. Free nitrogen atoms easily react with most elements to form nitrides, and even when two free nitrogen atoms collide to produce an excited N2 molecule, they may release so much energy on collision with even such stable molecules as carbon dioxide and water to cause homolytic fission into radicals such as CO and O or OH and H. Atomic nitrogen is prepared by passing an electric discharge through nitrogen gas at 0.1–2mmHg, which produces atomic nitrogen along with a peach-yellow emission that fades slowly as an afterglow <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>minutes</b> even after the discharge terminates.|$|E
5|$|During the quarter-finals, Canada {{faced the}} United States with McLeod {{starting}} in goal. In the twelfth {{minute of the}} game, American player Heather O'Reilly made a shot on goal, but it was stopped by McLeod. Angela Hucles then got the rebound and scored for the United States. However, McLeod injured her right knee during the play. She was down <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>minutes</b> before {{she got up and}} attempted to resume playing. A few minutes later, she was replaced by goalkeeper Karina LeBlanc in the 19th minute. The United States won the game 1–2. It was later revealed that McLeod had torn her right ACL.|$|E
5|$|Each 3milliliter dose lasts {{approximately}} 30minutes. Pain relief begins after 6–8 breaths {{and continues}} <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>minutes</b> after stopping inhalation. The {{maximum recommended dose}} is 6milliliters per day or 15milliliters per week {{because of the risk}} of cumulative dose-related nephrotoxicity, and it should not be used on consecutive days. Despite the potential for renal impairment when used at anesthetic doses, no significant adverse effects {{have been reported in the}} literature when it is used at the lower doses (up to 6milliliters) used for producing analgesia and sedation. Due to the risk of organ (especially renal) toxicity, methoxyflurane is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or diabetes mellitus, and is not recommended to be administered in conjunction with tetracyclines or other potentially nephrotoxic or enzyme-inducing drugs.|$|E

5|$|Golden jackals are monogamous {{and will}} remain with the one partner until death. Female jackals have only one {{breeding}} cycle each year. Breeding occurs from October to March in Israel and from February to March in India, Turkmenistan, Bulgaria, and Transcaucasia, with the mating period lasting up to 26–28 days. Females undergoing their first estrus are often pursued by several males that may quarrel among themselves. Mating results in a copulatory tie that lasts <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>minutes,</b> as it does with all other canids. Gestation lasts 63 days, and {{the timing of the}} births coincides with the annual abundance of food.|$|E
5|$|Like other rails, the Crex {{species have}} {{a wide range of}} vocalisations. The males of both crakes have a loud {{territorial}} and advertising call consisting of a series of grating notes repeated {{two or three times a}} second <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>minutes.</b> The male stands upright with his neck extended when advertising, with its head and neck almost vertical and bill wide open. Calling is most frequent early in the breeding season, mainly at night for the corn crake, but in the day for its African cousin. The corn crake's call may be repeated more than 20,000 times a night, with a peak between midnight and 3am.|$|E
5|$|Royal Sovereigns main {{opponent}} was {{the large}} Spanish first rate Santa Ana, {{with whom she}} was engaged <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>minutes</b> {{at the start of}} the action without support. During this time, Royal Sovereign was at one point engaged with five different enemy ships, and suffered heavy damage and casualties during the engagement, finally subduing the 112-gun Santa Ana after a duel lasting several hours. Both ships were left unmanageable at the end of the engagement, Royal Sovereign being taken in tow by HMS Euryalus into which Collingwood transferred his flag. Royal Sovereign had suffered nearly 150 casualties, Santa Ana over 300 by the end of the battle. Santa Ana was later abandoned by her captors and ultimately fell back into Spanish hands, but Royal Sovereign reached the safety of Gibraltar soon after the battle.|$|E
60|$|He {{tried to}} reply, {{but the effort}} caused him to cough, {{bringing}} about a hemorrhage of the lungs and again he fell back exhausted. <b>For</b> <b>several</b> long <b>minutes</b> he lay as one dead, then in an almost inaudible whisper he spoke.|$|R
60|$|Anne set {{the card}} {{up against the}} jugful of apple {{blossoms}} she had brought in to decorate the dinner-table--Marilla had eyed that decoration askance, but had said nothing--propped her chin on her hands, and fell to studying it intently <b>for</b> <b>several</b> silent <b>minutes.</b>|$|R
60|$|But <b>for</b> only <b>several</b> <b>minutes</b> the {{spectacle}} lasted. Such was {{the speed of}} the boat that it gained shelter behind the German, when the Mexican gunboat was compelled to cease fire. The speedboat slowed down, turned in a wide and heeling circle, and ranged up alongside the launch at the gangway.|$|R
5|$|The actual {{pay-per-view}} {{opened with}} the Legion of Doom (Hawk and Animal) taking on Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster). The Legion of Doom used {{their size and}} power to wear down their opponents in the opening minutes of the match. Money Inc. gained the advantage when Hawk missed a flying clothesline. Hawk tried to tag in his partner but was unable <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>minutes</b> because Money Inc. kept {{him away from the}} corner where Animal was standing. Eventually, Hawk and Schyster hit each other at the same time. Hawk tagged Animal in, and the Legion of Doom attempted the Doomsday device, their signature move. Schyster stopped them, but Animal hit Schyster in retaliation, causing Schyster to run into DiBiase. Animal then powerslammed DiBiase and pinned him to get the victory.|$|E
5|$|The tag team {{championship}} match came next, {{which saw}} the Beverly Brothers (Beau and Blake) attack the Natural Disasters (Earthquake and Typhoon) before the bell. The Disasters used {{their size and}} strength to gain the advantage, but Earthquake accidentally performed an avalanche on Typhoon. The Beverlys controlled the match <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>minutes,</b> with Blake executing a splash and a front facelock. Typhoon recovered and clotheslined both opponents {{but was unable to}} tag in Earthquake. Later, Typhoon tried to tag again, but Beau distracted Earthquake; while the referee's back was turned, The Beverlys' manager, The Genius handed Blake a metal scroll, which Blake used to hit Typhoon. Typhoon recovered, however, and Earthquake entered the ring and controlled the remainder of the match. He performed a powerslam on Beau before pinning him with an Earthquake splash.|$|E
5|$|The venom of Portia {{is unusually}} {{powerful}} against spiders. When a Portia stabs a small to medium spider (up to the Portia′s weight), including another Portia, the prey usually runs away for about 100 to 200millimetres, enters convulsions, becomes paralysed after 10 to 30seconds, and continues convulsing for 10seconds to 4minutes. Portia slowly approaches the prey and takes it. Portia usually needs to inflict up to 15stabbings to completely immobilise a larger spider (1.5 to 2times to the Portia′s weight), and then Portia may wait about 20 to 200millimetres away for 15 to 30minutes from seizing the prey. Insects {{are usually not}} immobilised so quickly but continue to struggle, sometimes <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>minutes.</b>|$|E
50|$|Parrots need to socialize. Some {{behavior}} problems may be averted through parrot training. As with any animal, training birds also requires patience, time, and commitment <b>for</b> up to <b>several</b> <b>minutes</b> {{a couple times}} a day.|$|R
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>several</b> strenuous <b>minutes</b> they reeled, locked together, {{about the}} trail, and fell against the trees, while {{neither of them}} {{concerned}} himself greatly about the strict rules of the game.

50|$|When disturbed, {{they tend}} to remain {{motionless}} <b>for</b> up to <b>several</b> <b>minutes.</b> They can probably live <b>for</b> <b>several</b> years, which is quite long for a harvestman, with molts occurring only every several months. They {{have been shown to}} survive without food for up to 43 days (Rudolph, 1979). They prey on very small arthropods, preferring springtails over booklice.|$|R
5|$|Another classic bit {{of cinema}} {{that is largely}} a myth is the {{showdown}} at high noon, where two well-matched gunslingers agree to meet for a climactic formal duel. These duels did occasionally happen, {{as in the case}} of the Luke Short – Jim Courtright duel, but gunfights were typically more spontaneous, a fight that turned deadly when one side reached for a weapon, and no one knew who actually won the fight <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>minutes</b> until the air finally cleared of smoke. Gunfights could be won by simple distraction, or pistols could be emptied as gunmen fought from behind cover without injury. When a gunman did square off, it rarely was with another gunfighter. Gunslingers usually gave each other a wide berth, and it was uncommon for two well-known gunslingers to face off. The gunslinger's reputation often was as valuable as any skills possessed. In Western films and books, young toughs often challenge experienced gunmen with the hopes of building a reputation, but this rarely happened in real life. A strong reputation was enough to keep others civil and often would spare a gunfighter from conflict. Even other gunslingers were likely to avoid any unnecessary confrontation.|$|E
5|$|Carolina wrens sing {{year round}} and {{at any point}} during the daytime, with the {{exception}} of performing during the most harsh weather conditions. The birds are also the only species in the Certhiidae family that neither sings in duet nor has their song control regions affect repertoire size. Males alone sing, and have a repertoire of at least twenty different phrase patterns and on average, thirty two. One of these patterns is repeated <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>minutes,</b> and although the male's song can be repeated up to twelve times, the general amount of songs range from three to five times in repetition. While singing, the tail of the birds is pointed downward. Some general vocalizations have been transcribed as teakettle-teakettle-teakettle and cheery-cheery-cheery. Various descriptions of the teakettle song include whee-udel, whee-udel, whee-udel, che-wortel, che-wortel and túrtee-túrtee-túrtee and familiar names and phrases such as sweet heart, sweet heart, come to me, come to me, sweet William, and Richelieu, Richelieu.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Juggernaut also competed as a singles wrestler. On September 12, 1999, he {{defeated}} Michelle Starr {{to win the}} NWA/ECCW Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship. The following month, {{he dropped}} the belt to Johnny Canuck in a three way match. He regained the belt in a rematch but was stripped of the title in December. A tournament was held for the vacant championship, which Juggernaut won to regain the title. He then became involved in a feud with Kurrgan, and the two traded the belt back and forth. Kurrgan beat Juggernaut for the title on February 25, 2000, but Juggernaut won it back two months later. He held the belt for a day before dropping it back to Kurrgan. When Kurrgan was stripped of the title for being unable to compete at a show in July, Juggernaut won the vacant championship by defeating Leatherface (Rick Patterson). At Juggernaut's request, the match was a {{two out of three}} falls tables match. During the match, he was legitimately unable to move <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>minutes</b> and suffered memory loss after Leatherface hit him with a chair.|$|E
60|$|And {{then there}} {{came to me}} a sudden {{realization}} of the predicament in which I had placed myself. I was entirely within {{the power of the}} savage man whose skiff I had stolen. Still clinging to the spear I looked into his face to find him scrutinizing me intently, and there we stood <b>for</b> some <b>several</b> <b>minutes,</b> each clinging tenaciously to the weapon the while we gazed in stupid wonderment at each other.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} an {{inquisitive}} and friendly animal {{when in the}} water, and will often accompany scuba divers. They will swim around divers <b>for</b> periods of <b>several</b> <b>minutes</b> at a time, even {{at a depth of}} 60m. On land, they are far less relaxed and tend to panic when people come near them.|$|R
5|$|As the {{deadline}} passed on April 2, Melkonian's armor entered the intersection and encountered {{a line of}} Azeri tanks and infantry. A firefight ensued but lasted <b>for</b> only <b>several</b> <b>minutes</b> as the defense line was soon battered and destroyed. Many of the Azeri forces were ill-prepared for the attack as Melkonian noted when pointing out to their lack of equipment. Despite having his force reduced down {{to a total of}} sixty-eight men, a force too weak to take the capital, he ordered them to continue forward.|$|R
5|$|Grigory Orlov, one of Catherine's lovers, led {{a palace}} coup in June 1762 that ousted the Emperor Peter III and enthroned Catherine II. Sergeant Potemkin {{represented}} his regiment in the revolt. Allegedly, as Catherine reviewed her troops {{in front of}} the Winter Palace before their march to the Peterhof, she lacked a sword-knot (or possibly hat plumage), which Potemkin quickly supplied. Potemkin's horse then (appeared to) refuse to leave her side <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>minutes</b> before Potemkin and horse returned to the ranks. After the coup Catherine singled out Potemkin for reward and ensured his promotion to second lieutenant. Though Potemkin was among those guarding the ex-Tsar, it appears that he had no direct involvement in Peter's murder in July. Catherine promoted him again to Kammerjunker (gentleman of the bedchamber), though he retained his post in the Guards. Potemkin was soon formally presented to the Empress as a talented mimic; his imitation of her was well received.|$|E
5|$|North Korean forces, meanwhile, flanked the American {{positions}} {{under cover}} of fog. The Koreans passed around the Americans' right flank and attacked the mortar positions in the rear. T-34 tanks also joined in the fight, and also passed around the American flanks while obscured by the fog. Around 0900 the North Korean forces in Chonui initiated a frontal assault on the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry's positions. An observer with the unit called in artillery and pushed back the North Korean infantry inflicting heavy casualties on the assaulting force. By 1100, the North Korean infantry, supported by several T-34s, was pressing on A Company's position, which was undermanned. At 1125 the requested airstrike came in; American aircraft rocketed the T-34s to no effect while strafing the Korean forces attacking A Company. The aircraft were able to push back the attack <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>minutes</b> before running out of ammunition and being forced to leave. The North Korean troops immediately resumed their assault.|$|E
5|$|On October 18, several {{thunderstorms}} {{already developed}} during the morning hours and continued to intensify during the afternoon. Just after 11:00 am EDT, one tornado in downtown Pensacola, Florida caused some extensive damage {{to the roof of}} a Baptist church as well as portions of Cordova Mall but there were no reported injuries at the Church and daycare center. During the early evenings severe weather affected the Louisville, Kentucky Metro area in which tree damage and power outage were reported throughout the area and a possible tornado at around 7:00 pm EDT near the Crescent Hill area which was later confirmed as a brief EF0. Still in the region, one tree fell over a passing car but the motorist escaped injuries although he was trapped <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>minutes</b> inside. The Louisville power authority, the LG reported as much as 2,500 homes without power mostly in St. Matthews and Crescent Hill areas. More storms rolled through much of the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys {{during the second half of}} the evening and overnight with more storms in Michigan.|$|E
5000|$|ECMA-407 uses inverse coding in {{the time}} domain, an {{invention}} by the Swiss-Austrian mathematician Clemens Par, and shows lowest spatial bitrates ever achieved (<b>for</b> instance, <b>several</b> <b>minutes</b> of NHK 22.2 may be represented by an encapsulated data package of 100 bytes). It was chosen for the World Intellectual Property Organization Award in 2009.

50|$|During 1980, Bruni {{made his}} first {{appearance}} as a soloist with the Orquesta Sinfónica Simón Bolívar (Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra), under the baton of Alberto Grau, at the Teresa Carreño Cultural Complex. Alberto Grau, {{founder and director of}} the world-renowned Schola Cantorum de Venezuela, conducted the Fantasía para un GentilHombre by Joaquín Rodrigo. The performance by Bruni of this Concerto for Guitar and Orchestra obtained such an incredible standing ovation that spanned <b>for</b> <b>several</b> consecutive <b>minutes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Day 25: Meanwhile, the Korean male housemates posed {{themselves}} as a K-Pop group called R2J. A video of them lip-synching to One Way's [...] "Magic" [...] was shown to both houses. R2J then visited the Villa and mingled with the housemates there <b>for</b> a <b>several</b> <b>minutes</b> before leaving.
