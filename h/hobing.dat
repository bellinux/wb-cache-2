50|$|<b>Hobe</b> (also: von <b>Hobe</b> von Gelting, Baron von Hobe-Gelting, <b>Hobe</b> Freiherr von Gelting or Monforts von <b>Hobe)</b> is {{the name}} of an old German noble family from Mecklenburg, which also became {{influential}} in Denmark.

50|$|According to {{more recent}} scholarship, the <b>Hobe</b> family is first {{mentioned}} with the knight Johannes <b>Hobe</b> on 20 May 1278. In 1376 the squire Henningk <b>Hobe</b> was {{witness to a}} deed. With Dietrich (Tiedeke) <b>Hobe</b> the Black (died 1379), lord at Wasdow, the family line begins for certain. Barthold <b>Hobe</b> and Lütke Hoben signed the Union of Mecklenburg Knights in 1523 for the family.

5000|$|... 19th century {{scholars}} {{assumed that}} the <b>Hobe</b> family came to Mecklenburg from Pomerania, but before {{that came from the}} Lower Rhine. It was there that the knight Hermannus dictus Hůbe scabinus in Willich appears in a record in 1272. In 1283 a knight named <b>Hobe</b> is mentioned as a witness for Kolbatz Abbey, one Hobo in 1284 in the town of Greifswald, Reimbertus <b>Hobe</b> is a witness for a deed of the monastery of Verchen in 1287, and his possible brother the knight Johannes <b>Hobe</b> was a witness for the town of Demmin 1292. The son of the latter, Johannes <b>Hobe,</b> owned half of Cavelsdorf in 1324-1325 in the Principality of Rügen. His descendants were still in possession of the fief of Beestland in the bailiwick of Loitz in 1524. The counter-argument, that the <b>Hobe</b> family moved early from Mecklenburg to Pomerania, also had its supporters.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hobe</b> Sound is {{positioned}} {{at the southern}} end of environmentally-sensitive Martin (named after Governor Martin) County. It has been stated that at <b>Hobe</b> Sound’s front door lies the Gold Coast and that at her back door lies the Treasure Coast. Thus, <b>Hobe</b> Sound can lend to both while retaining its proud heritage and unique personality. <b>Hobe</b> Sound’s proximity to the coast affords immediate access to the Atlantic Ocean and the deep-channeled Intracoastal Waterway, a 1200 mi water route that provides a sheltered passage for boats along the eastern seaboard.|$|R
50|$|Many {{officers}} in the Prussian army came from the family. A von <b>Hobe</b> was commander of the Hussar Regiment (Nr. 3) from 1811 to 1813. In the Napoleonic Wars, August Johann von <b>Hobe,</b> and Karl Friedrich von <b>Hobe,</b> both distinguished themselves and were awarded the Pour le Mérite (in 1813 and 1814 respectively).

It was not until 1985 that <b>Hobe</b> Fort was designated by the Ministry of the Interior, Executive Yuan, as a National Level 2 Ancient Monument.

25|$|Earlier, Tauentzien sent {{an officer}} named <b>Hobe</b> with one battalion, one squadron, and two guns to Crispendorf about six {{kilometers}} west of Schleiz. <b>Hobe's</b> assignment was {{to guard the}} right flank and maintain communications with Schimmelpfennig's cavalry in Pößneck. When Tauenzien began to fall back, <b>Hobe's</b> detachment retreated to the northeast to rejoin his division. At the wood near Pörmitz, a village four kilometers north of Schleiz, the detachment found itself caught between Murat's cavalry and one of Drouet's battalions. Attacked in a marshy forest, <b>Hobe's</b> force was badly mauled and lost one of its cannons. Most of the losses in the battle were from <b>Hobe's</b> luckless detachment. The Prussians and Saxons lost 12 officers and 554 rank and file killed, wounded, captured, and missing, {{as well as one}} artillery piece captured. French losses are unknown but probably light.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Head-of-bed {{elevation}} (<b>HOBE)</b> {{has been}} shown to assist in reducing respiratory complications associated with mechanical ventilation; however, there is minimal research describing changes in end-expiratory lung volume. This study aims to investigate changes in end-expiratory lung volume in a supine position and 2 levels of <b>HOBE.</b> METHODS: Twenty postoperative cardiac surgery subjects were examined using electrical impedance tomography. End-expiratory lung impedance (EELI) was recorded as a surrogate measurement of end-expiratory lung volume in a supine position and at 20 ° and then 30 °. RESULTS: Significant increases in end-expiratory lung volume were seen at both 20 ° and 30 ° <b>HOBE</b> in all lung regions, except the anterior, with the largest changes from baseline (supine) seen at 30 °. From baseline to 30 ° <b>HOBE,</b> global EELI increased by 1, 327 impedance units (95...|$|R
