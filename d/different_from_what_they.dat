25|$|After the 1996 crisis, the Turkish and Greek {{governments have}} made various claims that certain {{diplomatic}} exchanges between Turkey and Italy after 1932, and between Turkey and Greece after 1947, provided {{proof that the}} respective opponents at that time held legal opinions <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> claim today, making their present stance inconsistent and untenable. Thus, Turkey has claimed that both the Italian government during the 1930s and the Greek government between 1947 and the 1950s had shown itself to be well aware that the 1932 protocol did not provide legal grounds for an exact delimitation of the boundary.|$|E
25|$|When {{determining}} if {{an outcome}} has been achieved, assessments may become too mechanical, looking {{only to see}} if the student has acquired the knowledge. The ability to use and apply the knowledge in different ways may not be the focus of the assessment. The focus on determining if the outcome has been achieved leads to a loss of understanding and learning for students, who may never be shown how to use the knowledge they have gained. Instructors are faced with a challenge: they must learn to manage an environment that can become fundamentally <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are accustomed to. In regards to giving assessments, they must be willing to put in the time required to create a valid, reliable assessment that ideally would allow students to demonstrate their understanding of the information, while remaining objective.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{ingredients}} are fictional, mixing them together creates nonfictional cocktails as well, {{such as the}} Piledriver or Blue Fairy. To add additional variety, patrons at the bar may ask for single, multiple, or one large drink; these drinks can be served either aged or with ice. Players must also pay attention to infer what patrons actually want, which may be <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> order. For example, a character might be feeling depressed {{and ask for a}} sweet drink, though the player instead giving them a shot of alcohol to help them forget their troubles would have a better effect. Alternately, the player may {{be able to make a}} character happy by talking to them instead of letting them feed on their alcoholism. At various points, the player can also tweak the customer's drink, such as adding Karmotrine to a cocktail that was previously non-alcoholic. In these ways, the player creates new scenarios as they advance in the game.|$|E

500|$|Editing and {{post-production}} work on Alien took roughly 20 {{weeks to}} complete. Terry Rawlings served as editor, having previously worked with Scott on editing sound for The Duellists. Scott and Rawlings edited {{much of the}} film to have a slow pace to build suspense for the more tense and frightening moments. According to Rawlings: [...] "I think {{the way we did}} get it right was by keeping it slow, funny enough, which is completely <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> do today. And I think the slowness of it made the moments that you wanted people to be sort of scared...then we could go as fast as we liked because you've sucked people into a corner and then attacked them, so to speak. And I think that's how it worked." [...] The first cut of the film was over three hours long; further editing trimmed the final version to just under two hours.|$|E
500|$|Sivaji Ganesan {{was cast}} as the male lead. Both the female leads– B. Saroja Devi and Sowcar Janaki– were cast in roles <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were earlier {{proposed}} for. According to Ganesan's eldest son Ramkumar, [...] "Sivaji always thought of Sowcar Janaki as classy and sophisticated," [...] which was why he cast her as a [...] "modern woman" [...] in Puthiya Paravai. [...] "Before that Sowcar had only acted in homely roles". Mirasi, who made a cameo appearance as the hero's father in the film, was initially not convinced about Janaki acting in the film. But after seeing her performance in the song [...] "Paartha Gnaabagam Illaiyo", Mirasi decided to include her {{for the rest of}} the film. Janaki added her own subtle distinctions and inputs to her role as portraying an out-and-out seductive vamp, according to her, would have felt deplorable. Nagesh, S. V. Ramadoss, V. K. Ramasamy, M. R. Radha, O. A. K. Thevar and Manorama were cast in supporting roles.|$|E
500|$|... "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] {{was written}} by Beyoncé Knowles, Solange Knowles, Angie Beyincé and {{produced}} as well as co-written by The Bama Boyz. Jonathan Wells of Bama Boyz said that they decided to try something <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> usually do, by mixing several genres for [...] "Why Don't You Love Me". The song's inspiration came {{from the time they}} spent in London at the end of Beyoncé Knowles' The Beyoncé Experience tour in promotion of her second studio album B'Day (2006). The writing and production of the song began in London and was finished stateside in early 2008. They admitted that the song's structure was unusual, however they were happy that it ended up in the Knowles' hands. After The Bama Boyz produced two tracks on Solange Knowles' second studio album Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams (2008), she asked them to put instrumentals together for her to write for her sister Beyoncé.|$|E

500|$|On April 23, Yankovic {{recorded}} [...] "Christmas at Ground Zero". The song, [...] "a cheery little tune about death, {{destruction and}} the end of the world" [...] was the result of Scotti Brothers Records' insistence that Yankovic release a Christmas record. After Yankovic presented the song to his label, they relented, because it was [...] "a little <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were expecting." [...] After the song's release, some radio stations banned the record, a move that Yankovic attributes to [...] "most people [...] to hear about nuclear annihilation during the holiday season." [...] Following the September 11 attacks, when the general term [...] "ground zero" [...] was co-opted as a proper name for the World Trade Center site where two of those attacks took place, the disturbing lyrics caused this song to be banned largely from radio. Yankovic wanted the song to receive a video, but due to budget reasons, his label did not agree. Yankovic, however, directed one himself which was mostly made up of stock footage, with a live action finale that was filmed in an economically devastated part of the Bronx, New York that looked like a bomb had gone off. The final original that was recorded was [...] "Good Enough for Now", a country music pastiche about how the singer's lover, who, while not the best, will do for now.|$|E

Only now, the circumstances were very <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had been in the 1930s: He was no longer a promising young scholar on a trip abroad, supported and sponsored by his native country; instead, he was a middle-aged political refugee who had fled a communist dictatorship behind the Iron Curtain; but he was welcomed at Harvard just the same, obtaining employment as a lecturer and research associate, collaborating with Wassily Leontief on the Harvard Economic Research Project and other subjects. This was not a permanent employment, though.|$|E
2500|$|One of the centerpieces of Marx's {{critique}} of political economy {{is that the}} juridical labour contract between the worker and his capitalist employer obscures the true economic relationship, which is (according to Marx) that the workers do not sell their labor, but their labor power, making possible a profitable difference between what they are paid and the new value they create for the owners of capital (a form of economic exploitation). Thus, the very foundation of capitalist wealth creation involves – as Marx says explicitly – a [...] "mask". More generally, Marx argues that transactions in the capitalist economy are often far from transparent – they appear <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> really are.

2500|$|Mathematically, spacetime is a manifold, {{which is}} to say, it appears locally [...] "flat" [...] near each point {{in the same way}} that, at small enough scales, a globe appears flat. An {{extremely}} large scale factor, [...] (conventionally called the speed-of-light) relates distances measured in space with distances measured in time. The magnitude of this scale factor (nearly [...] in space being equivalent to 1second in time), along with the fact that spacetime is a manifold, implies that at ordinary, non-relativistic speeds and at ordinary, human-scale distances, there is little that humans might observe which is noticeably <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> might observe if the world were Euclidean. It was only with the advent of sensitive scientific measurements in the mid-1800s, such as the Fizeau experiment and the Michelson–Morley experiment, that puzzling discrepancies began to be noted between observation versus predictions based on the implicit assumption of Euclidean space.|$|E

2500|$|Najac, on {{the other}} hand, was repulsed by Margueritte's {{criminal}} Pierrot and offended when the Cercle turned his pantomime Barbe-Bluette (Pink-Beard, 1889) into an [...] "old melodrama rejuvenated by indecent innuendoes." [...] And, like Margueritte, he [...] "had wanted," [...] as Storey observes, [...] "a close circle of associates, committed to the pantomime {{in a spirit of}} comradeship". [...] The Larchers had grander plans: as Félix told Paul Hugounet, [...] "we wantedstill while preserving the Cercle form, such as I had sketched out in the statutesto approximate a theatrical organization, which, in our opinion, had the only chance of succeeding." [...] The Larchers' model was the Thtre-Libre of Antoine"with this difference: we resisted the intervention of amateur actors." [...] Their ambitions went farther: the [...] "conventional and unintelligible gestures of the old pantomime" [...] were to be suppressed; the music was to follow closely the business on stage, putting [...] "the utterance of the gesture into the orchestra"; in short, [...] "the best theories of Wagner" [...] were to be applied to the pantomime. [...] Hugounet later {{even went so far as}} to interview the composers of the Cercle on their response to [...] "the Wagnerian tradition." [...] The upshot was predictable: Margueritte and Najac withdrew from the Cercle, and Margueritte's friend Beissier followed suit. [...] The result was an organization that was very <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had imagined: the Cercle strove to please its publicwhile encouraging its authors to embrace what was then the theatrical vanguard.

The song symbolizes the Girl Power philosophy by showing the support between each other and finding the strength to continue. The fifth track, [...] "Last Time Lover", was originally called [...] "First Time Lover" [...] and was about the loss of virginity, but was discarded and changed to a song full of provocations, where sex is the main issue. The sixth track, [...] "Mama", was dedicated to the group's mothers, and deals with the difficulties in the relationships between mothers and teenagers that appear during adolescence. Reviewers described the ballad as [...] "glossy" [...] and [...] "corny". The seventh track, [...] "Who Do You Think You Are" [...] is about the presumptuous superstar life and how someone can get trapped in the world of fame. The inspiration for this song came from some of the people the group met in the music industry. It was well received by critics, who thought that the song was one of the group's [...] "strongest and underrated songs" [...] and that it (still) [...] "feels relevant today". The two songs were released as a double A-side single, the fourth and last one released from the album, becoming the fourth consecutive number-one of the group in the United Kingdom, and reaching the top 10 across continental Europe. [...] "Something Kinda Funny", the eighth track of the album, is about the [...] "fun" [...] the group experienced together, and how it was fate that they came to know each other. The ninth track, [...] "Naked" [...] deals with vulnerability and the step from girls to women and how this process made the group stronger, something they were experiencing at that moment. It received mixed reviews from critics; some described it as [...] "soulful and funky as anything by TLC or Brand New Heavies", while others considered the song as a [...] "bit of a let down".
