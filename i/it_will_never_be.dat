The cyclone also caused minor damage in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.

5|$|Some {{weeks after}} their encounter, word reached Le Gris of accusations being made against him by Carrouges and his wife. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> known what basis these {{allegations}} {{had in fact}} but Carrouges claimed that on 18 January 1386, whilst Carrouges was still in Paris, Le Gris had entered the chateau of Carrouges' mother Nicole and there raped Marguerite. According to Marguerite de Carrouges' testimony, a squire in Le Gris' employ named Adam Louvel had {{knocked on the door}} of the chateau and demanded entry. All the servants were attending to Dame Nicole de Carrouges, who was visiting a neighbouring town on legal business, and so Marguerite was alone when Louvel called. Once inside, Louvel gave Marguerite a message that Le Gris was outside and desired to see her because he was passionately in love with her. Although Marguerite protested, Le Gris broke into the house and propositioned her, offering money in exchange. When Marguerite refused, Le Gris attempted to take her by force and raped her on the bed in her chamber with the help of Louvel. As Le Gris departed, he threatened her with violence if she told of the encounter.|$|E
25|$|Achieving {{a closed}} orbit is not {{essential}} to lunar and interplanetary voyages. Early Russian space vehicles successfully achieved very high altitudes without going into orbit. NASA considered launching Apollo missions directly into lunar trajectories but adopted the strategy of first entering a temporary parking orbit and then performing a separate burn several orbits later onto a lunar trajectory. This costs additional propellant because the parking orbit perigee must be high enough to prevent reentry while direct injection can have an arbitrarily low perigee because <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> reached.|$|E

25|$|Although {{transitional}} fossils {{elucidate the}} evolutionary transition of one life-form to another, they only exemplify snapshots of this process. Due {{to the special}} circumstances required for preservation of living beings, {{only a very small}} percentage of all life-forms that ever have existed can be expected to be discovered. Thus, the transition itself can only be illustrated and corroborated by transitional fossils, but <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> known in detail. Progressing research and discovery managed to fill in several gaps and continues to do so. Critics of evolution often cite this argument as being a convenient way to explain off the lack of 'snapshot' fossils that show crucial steps between species.|$|E
25|$|Chewing gum {{is rather}} shelf stable {{because of its}} {{non-reactive}} nature and low moisture content. The water activity of chewing gum ranges from 0.40-0.65. The moisture content of chewing gum ranges from 3-6%. In fact, chewing gum retains its quality for so long that, in most countries, it is not {{required by law to}} be labeled with an expiration date. If chewing gum remains in a stable environment, over time the gum may become brittle or lose some of its flavor, but <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> unsafe to eat. If chewing gum is exposed to moisture, over time water migration may occur, making the gum soggy. In lollipops with a gum center, water migration can lead {{to the end of the}} product’s shelf life, causing the exterior hard candy shell to soften and the interior gum center to harden.|$|E
