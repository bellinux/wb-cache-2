The second system was developed by MTS Systems Corporation for The Cat in the Hat. This system was simpler, offering track-mounted spinning platforms, with no additional <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>freedom.</b> The MIB design team initially intended to utilise the Spider-Man ride system; however, when shooting tests were performed on the ride, the vast motion of the vehicles {{made it impossible for}} riders to achieve a reasonable score. As a result, The Cat in the Hat system was selected for the MIB attraction.|$|E
