5|$|During {{this same}} time, Dunderdale {{was named the}} best fiscal {{performer}} of Canada's premiers by the Fraser Institute. The institute measured the performance of all premiers for their time in office, which was the 2011-2012 fiscal year for Dunderdale, and looked at their performance on three core components of fiscal policy: <b>government</b> <b>spending,</b> taxes, and debt and deficits. Dunderdale received a score of 71.4 {{out of a possible}} 100.0, though the report did mention that her strong performance with regards to <b>government</b> <b>spending</b> was in part due to the province’s significant economic growth and not her ability to restrain growth in spending.|$|E

5|$|Although Keynes {{has been}} widely criticised – {{especially}} {{by members of the}} Chicago school of economics – for advocating irresponsible <b>government</b> <b>spending</b> financed by borrowing, in fact he was a firm believer in balanced budgets and regarded the proposals for programs of public works during the Great Depression as an exceptional measure {{to meet the needs of}} exceptional circumstances.|$|E

5|$|The era of import {{substitution}} ended in 1976, {{but at the}} same time growing <b>government</b> <b>spending,</b> large wage increases and inefficient production created a chronic inflation that rose through the 1980s. The measures enacted during the last dictatorship also contributed to the huge foreign debt by the late 1980s, which became equivalent to three-fourths of the GNP.|$|E

5|$|An {{economic}} crisis took {{effect in the}} mid-1980s to late 1990s {{as a result of}} international economic conditions, drought, falling petroleum prices, and years of corruption, mismanagement, and cronyism. Cameroon turned to foreign aid, cut <b>government</b> <b>spending,</b> and privatised industries. With the reintroduction of multi-party politics in December 1990, the former British Southern Cameroons pressure groups called for greater autonomy, and the Southern Cameroons National Council advocated complete secession as the Republic of Ambazonia.|$|E
5|$|Brown's 2000 Spending Review {{outlined}} a major expansion of <b>government</b> <b>spending,</b> particularly {{on health and}} education. In his April 2002 budget, Brown increased National Insurance {{to pay for health}} spending. He also introduced working tax credits, and in his last budget as Chancellor, Brown gave an extra £3billion in pension allowances, an increase in the child tax credit, and an increase in the working tax credit. These increases were followed by another £1billion of support for increases in the child tax credit.|$|E
5|$|Growing <b>government</b> <b>spending,</b> large wage raises, {{and inefficient}} {{production}} created a chronic inflation that {{rose through the}} 1980s, when it briefly exceeded {{an annual rate of}} 1000%. Successive regimes tried to control inflation by wage and price controls, cuts in public spending, and restriction of the money supply. Efforts to stem the problems came to naught when in 1982 Argentina came into conﬂict with the United Kingdom over the Falkland Islands.|$|E

5|$|The 2012 {{budget was}} {{delivered}} by Finance Minister Marshall on April 24, 2012, {{and was a}} stark contrast from the austerity budget that Dunderdale and her ministers had been warning of for months. Only 45 temporary positions were cut from the public service and a review of programs found $38.8 million in savings, {{much lower than the}} $100 million Dunderdale had previously mentioned. <b>Government</b> <b>spending</b> actually increased in the budget by 1.7 per cent, though this was below the rate of inflation.|$|E
5|$|The Ron Paul presidential {{campaign}} of 1988 began in early 1987 when former Congressman Ron Paul of Texas announced his candidacy for the 1988 presidential nomination of the Libertarian Party.

5|$|The service {{industry}} {{is the largest}} economic contributor in South Dakota. This sector includes the retail, finance, and health care industries. Citibank, which was the largest bank holding company in the United States at one time, established national banking operations in South Dakota in 1981 {{to take advantage of}} favorable banking regulations. <b>Government</b> <b>spending</b> is another important segment of the state's economy, providing over ten percent of the gross state product.

5|$|A liberal {{is someone}} who favors {{censorship}} of Christianity plus increased <b>government</b> <b>spending</b> and power, as in ObamaCare. Increasingly liberals side with the homosexual agenda, including same-sex marriage. Many liberals favor a welfare state where people receive endless entitlements without working. Liberals are often anti-Christian, or otherwise disagree with moral or social principles held by many American Christians. The liberal ideology has worsened {{over the years and}} degenerated into economically delusional views and intolerant ideology. Some liberals simply support, in knee-jerk fashion, the opposite of conservative principles without having any meaningful values of their own.|$|E
5|$|Academic {{research}} {{increased at}} the turn of the 20th century, and as the Ministry of Works took control of the sites, <b>government</b> <b>spending</b> on these investigations began. Historians such as Sidney Toy and Charles Peers published work on the sites, and research continued under Arnold Taylor, who joined the Office of Works as an assistant inspector in 1935. Major academic reports were published in the 1950s, adding to the sites' reputation. Taylor was also instrumental in the successful opposition to road projects proposed in the 1970s which would have had a substantial impact on the appearance of the Conwy site. In the late 20th century, detailed reconstructions of the castles were painted by historical artists including Terry Ball, John Banbury and Ivan Lapper.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the issue of}} female political representation {{and the extent to}} which it effects <b>government</b> health <b>spending</b> as a share of GDP in states with varying income levels. First, the paper reviews and discusses the broad literature on determinants of <b>government</b> health <b>spending</b> and the literature related to gender and health spending, generally. Second, it tests whether female parliamentary representation can explain parts of the variation in <b>government</b> health <b>spending</b> across countries and over time. To do so, it uses country-level data and controls for known determinants of <b>government</b> health <b>spending.</b> The results show that increased female parliamentary representation is associated with higher <b>government</b> health <b>spending.</b> Moreover, this association remains significant even after controlling for other determinants of <b>government</b> health <b>spending,</b> indicating that that the effect may be partially causal. The results also indicate that if lowand middle-income countries increased their share of women in parliaments by 10 percentage points, <b>government</b> health <b>spending</b> as a portion of GDP would, on average, increase by between 10 and 12 percent. The corresponding figure for high-income countries is around 5 percent. Overall, the analysis suggests that the level of female representation in parliaments has significant effect on countries health spending...|$|R

5|$|Among {{professional}} economists {{the revival}} of Keynesian economics has been even more divisive. Although many economists, such as George Akerlof, Paul Krugman, Robert Shiller, and Joseph Stiglitz, supported Keynesian stimulus, others did not believe higher <b>government</b> <b>spending</b> would help the United States economy recover from the Great Recession. Some economists, such as Robert Lucas, questioned the theoretical basis for stimulus packages. Others, like Robert Barro and Gary Becker, say that empirical evidence for beneficial effects from Keynesian stimulus does not exist. However, {{there is a growing}} academic literature that shows that fiscal expansion helps an economy grow in the near term, and that certain types of fiscal stimulus are particularly effective.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{took office}} {{during a period}} of {{economic}} recession {{in the wake of the}} bursting of the dot-com bubble. The terrorist attacks also impacted the economy. His administration increased federal <b>government</b> <b>spending</b> from $1.789 trillion to $2.983 trillion (60percent) while revenues increased from $2.025 trillion to $2.524 trillion (from 2000 to 2008). Individual income tax revenues increased by 14percent, corporate tax revenues by 50percent, customs and duties by 40percent. Discretionary defense spending was increased by 107percent, discretionary domestic spending by 62percent, Medicare spending by 131percent, social security by 51percent, and income security spending by 130percent. Cyclically adjusted, revenues rose by 35percent and spending by 65percent.|$|E
