40|$|The {{intent of}} this project was to {{synthesize}} information gained by studying the myths and art of India and Hopi and to produce works of art that reflect the concepts learned from the study. The main focus of the creative project is nature's elements of earth, fire and sun. I chose to explore the myths, legends and art that express these elements {{with the belief that}} these cultural aspects reflect a close understanding of these elements of nature. For the investigative study, two different methods were chosen, due to the geographical location and number of people in these two cultures. Given the small size and relative close proximity of the Hopi culture, cultural anthropology through the Anthropology Department was the best approach, allowing for field work and an "over-all" study of the culture. I went to the Hopi Mesas of Arizona and visited the museums and galleries that housed Hopi art. I then researched their history and daily customs. From these <b>I</b> <b>narrowed</b> <b>my</b> focus to legends and art that related to the elements earth, fire and sun. Because of the many regional and religious diversities of India, I chose the India Studies Department where there were people from that culture teaching courses in mythology. After researching myths and epics, <b>I</b> <b>narrowed</b> <b>my</b> focus to the Rig Vedic hymns that have been passed down from approximately 1500 B. C. and have influenced much of India. I then researched the art, concentrating on sculpture and painting that best reflected the Vedic concepts of earth, fire and sun. My over-all approach to this project was to alternate between concentrated times of research and concentrated times of art work thus allowing me time to digest the information before putting it into art form. The methods of art where chosen by concentrating first on different aspects of these elements and then on what materials would best express those aspects. I avoided using the symbolism from these cultures in my work because I wanted the images to reflect my background as well as their (Hopi and India) understanding of earth, fire and sun.

40|$|Preceptorship {{tends to}} be the teaching/learning method of choice for senior level nursing {{students}} engaging in clinical practice because it offers a reality-oriented learning context and fosters professional socialization into the culture of nursing. The pairing of a student with an experienced nurse is an approach to teaching/learning that promotes critical thinking, cultivates practical wisdom, and facilitates competence. In today’s nursing clinical practice settings, there can be up to four distinct generations (Veterans, Baby Boomers, Gen Xers, and Millennials) present and each generation brings its own values and expectations to the teaching/learning process. Exploring the nature of the preceptorship experience in this context is a significant and relevant topic for nursing education and practice. To date, a paucity of research is evident in this area. The purpose of this paper-based thesis is to explore nursing pedagogy in the intergenerational context and more specifically, to examine the preceptorship model of clinical teaching/learning within this context. I begin broadly in the first manuscript with an examination of nursing pedagogy through a generational lens and proffer that nurse educators should begin to engage in a critical discourse regarding the adequacy of current pedagogical practice in relation to meeting the needs and expectations of today’s students, the Millennial Generation.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{numerous}} {{images of}} violence perpetrated by radicalized followers of Islam, has highlighted the complexities surrounding assimilation {{and integration of}} Muslims in Western society. Since the guest worker recruitment from French African colonies initiated after World War II, France has been witness to the unanticipated development of permanent communities of African laborers, {{many of whom are}} Muslim. Despite consistent promotion of French monoculture and specifically the use of the assimilation model for integration, segregation of African Muslims has occurred. Through the construction of a single country case study, I explore integration issues surrounding the French Muslim minority communities. I seek to assess the occurrences of segregation among African Muslims, and theorize that process established by the French government for the assimilation and integration of African Muslims into French society has culminated in the formation of segregated African Muslim diaspora communities. This topic was chosen because I possess a general interest in the integration of Muslims into Western society. Due to the broadness of the Muslim population, and given their high visibility <b>I</b> <b>narrowed</b> <b>my</b> focus on African Muslims. Furthermore, this topic was chosen to determine the viability of the French case {{as an alternative to the}} failed policies of multiculturalism. Therefore, I examine the assimilation strategy of French Republicanism established in France by the French Revolution of 1789. This thesis is relevant given the rising visibility of Muslims throughout Western society. Furthermore, the increased visibility highlights the position of African Muslim communities in France. The evidence presented in my thesis demonstrates that the presence of segregated African Muslim communities is an unintended consequence of the historical development of French monoculture and colonialism. French assimilation of African Muslims is not a complete failure due to marginal successes of African Muslims in political and economic arenas. Furthermore, the segregation of African Muslims in France does not diminish the viability of assimilation strategy in the overall integration of Muslims into Western society, especially as politicians across the European continent denounce the failed policies of multiculturalism...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} popularity of video games in mass media culture, I will be investigating one particular video game series, Portal: Still Alive and Portal 2, and the manner by which players learn from them. After observing that most instructors use these games in physics and math classes, I want to expand more on the way that video games enact a new story-telling feature through experiential means, which also serves a pedagogical function. I assert that players learn from games through their interactive gameplay, which allows them to engage with the game narrative that contains ideological content embedded through portrayal of characters, plot development, use of imagery and text, and thematic development. Thus, I develop my model of video game literacy through interactivity with a game narrative. My model, Critical Narrative Gaming Literacy, provides a construction of game narrative comprising of thematic development as the central component encompassing {{the development of the}} other narrative elements such as plot, character, use of symbols, setting, and point of view. A new form of Cultural Studies that incorporates the study of video games, Critical Narrative Gaming Literacy is informed by theorizations in Cultural Studies, Critical Pedagogy, and Psychoanalysis as articulated in Literacy Theory. In my analysis of the game series, I investigate the narrative using a means of comparison to Jacques Lacan’s reading of Antigone and examine themes of the sublimated death drive, violence, and sado-masochism, since I experienced those themes manifesting through plot and character development and the use of symbols. Due to the interactive nature of video games and variability in gameplay, I also capture the manner by which undergraduate players experience the narratives differently from each other. Thus, taking a phenomenological approach to data collection through 13 interviews with 13 different participants, <b>I</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>my</b> focus on 5 different participants’ experiences of the game series. These participants express their experiences of the game series as revealing a mother-daughter relationship and a cautionary tale of science and power...|$|R
40|$|Theses (M. A) -University of KwaZulu Natal, Durban, 2009. The Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B. C. is {{an event}} of Greek history that has {{inspired}} numerous subsequent receptions. Many of these later ‘receptions’ of the battle have been studied in varying degrees of detail by scholars over the years, however certain periods, or modes of reception have been ignored or neglected in this scholarship. In this dissertation I examine some of these neglected areas of research. These areas include: the uses and abuses of the Battle of Thermopylae in contemporary popular culture. In this section I focus primarily on Frank Miller’s graphic novel 300 (1998 / 9), as well as Zack Snyder’s 2006 film of the same name. Secondly I focus on a ‘national’ response to the ‘Thermopylae theme’, in which I consider its use in South Africa. <b>I</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>my</b> focus to examine its use as a motif in the poetry of the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879. Finally I explore how the Battle of Thermopylae was employed by writers of children’s literature in the Victorian period, where I delimit my discussion to Caroline Dale Snedeker’s The Coward of Thermopylae (1911), as well as Andrew Lang’s short story: ‘The Spartan Three Hundred’ in The True Story Book (1893). These categories cover films, graphic novels, poetry as well as fiction and non-fiction for children. Yet despite being disparate categories, each of these periods, places or genres maintains the ‘kernel’ {{of the story of}} Thermopylae: a few, brave Greeks who fought for freedom against the countless Persians invading their land. At the same time different elements of the story are exploited to highlight various issues important in the different contexts and periods. It is my hope that this thesis will not only play a role in researching these lesser known appropriations and adaptations of the Battle of Thermopylae, but that it will also ‘break boundaries’ in the field of reception studies within the discipline of Classics...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Lichens are an {{important}} part of the biota in western Oregon forests, where they perform valuable ecological roles and contribute significantly to biodiversity. Lichens in western Oregon are threatened by a number of factors including air pollution and land use practices. If we wish to maintain the persistence of lichens in future landscapes it is critical that we understand the responses of lichen communities and individual lichen species to the environment and forest structure. This dissertation explores factors that are related to differences in lichen community composition and the distributions of individual lichen species in the western Cascades of Oregon, using a large landscape scale data set. I sought to relate major gradients in lichen community composition to environmental factors, and describe differences in lichen communities with respect to forest age (Chapter 2). I found three major gradients in lichen communities at a landscape scale in the western Oregon Cascades. These gradients were related to climate as expressed by elevation and annual temperature, air quality, north-south position, the richness of epiphytic macrolichens, and forest age. I developed a rarity score, which can be used to identify hotspots of rare species diversity at a landscape scale (Chapter 3). I then built descriptive models of this rarity score to identify abiotic and biotic factors associated with the occurrence of rarity hotspots. I found that models of rarity score that used explanatory variables based on lichen community composition performed better than models that used explanatory variables based solely on environmental factors. <b>I</b> <b>narrowed</b> <b>my</b> focus to the level of individual species responses to the environment and forest structure by developing habitat models for 11 lichen species in the western Cascades (Chapter 4). We selected these species because they performed important ecological roles, were rare across the landscape and associated with old growth forests, or because their distributions were poorly understood. These models can be used to increase the efficiency of landscape level surveys for rare species, predict the response of these species to forest management practices, and understand factors associated with the distributions of these lichens...|$|R
40|$|Title: Performing Work: Internationalism and Theatre of Fact {{between the}} U. S. A. and the U. S. S. R. 		Theatre’s public, and yet {{intimate}} emotional ability to demarcate extraordinary occurrences and provoke communal escalation make it useful for internationalist organizing. “Performing Work: Internationalism and Theatre of Fact between the U. S. and the U. S. S. R.,” traces 1920 s and 1930 s leftist theatre through transnational circuits {{of political and}} aesthetic dialogue. I argue that these plays form a shared lexicon in response to regional economic and political challenges. Sergei Tretiakov’s Rychi, Kitai/Roar, China! (1926); Hallie Flanagan and Margaret Ellen Clifford’s Can You Hear Their Voices? (1931); Langston Hughes’s Scottsboro Limited (1931); and Hughes, Ella Winter, and Ann Hawkins’s Harvest (1933 - 34) constitute the dissertation’s primary texts. “Performing Work” begins by reading the Soviet play Roar, China! {{as a work of}} theatre of fact which performs conflicted internationalisms in plot, and in its politicized production history. The middle chapters track revisions to Soviet factography and internationalism by three American plays in light of the Depression, racism, feminism, and labor disputes. The study considers the reception of Russian and English translations, as well as figurative translations across cultural contexts. Performance theory and literary history support this analysis of dramatic forms—embodied, temporal, and textual. <b>I</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>my</b> study to four plays from the United States and Soviet Union to argue for the tangible impact of ephemeral contact and performance in order to resist polarizing simplification of relationships between these two countries. The three central figures of this study, Sergei Mikhailovich Tretiakov (1892 - 1937), Hallie Flanagan (1890 - 1969), and Langston Hughes (1909 - 1967) each had either direct or indirect contact with one another and with each other’s theatrical work. This study is primarily concerned with the transnational circulation of politically significant dramatic form and only secondarily occupied with verifying direct influence from one author to another. The four plays participate in transnational dialogue on working conditions, cultural imperialism, racist legal systems, and gender inequality.

40|$|To {{introduce}} myself, I’d like to {{say that}} my research is on ancestry in literature. This is a broad topic, which could be applied to many possible contexts, so <b>I</b> have <b>narrowed</b> <b>my</b> focus to one specific area. I am interested in the recent novels by Thomas Keneally and Christopher Koch, and more broadly the situation of the Irish in Australia. So I am looking at Australians with Irish ancestry. This paper will look at the relationship between ancestral narratives and historical consciousness; or rather, how ancestry coincides with historiography. First I’ll ask a rather obvious question: what is ancestry? I have a working definition which runs along these lines: “the perceived relationship between two individuals who share biological origins; this relationship usually spans across historical time, and thus is vertical (in the family tree metaphor). ” A quote illustrating this kind of definition comes from a significant work on kinship metaphors. Genealogy connects past, present and future into one. It connects ancestors in the past to real descendants in the future, binds them into one living unity. This yields a model of humanity that unifies human diversity: living individuals are a lateral plurality, vastly divergent, even competing, but nonetheless united vertically into a descending tree. ...|$|R

I surveyed ninety-three freshmen male athletes. <b>I</b> then <b>narrowed</b> <b>my</b> research to focus specifically on male freshmen athletes from all sports and football players of all years, since football has the highest percentage of athletes from low-income backgrounds. I then interviewed six student athletes on the football team. I found that whether or not a student athlete is read to as a child, enjoyed reading as a child, and continued to read and perform well throughout high school affect how they perceive their ability to read at a college level. This is evident especially when looking at the difference between low income and non low-income student athletes, freshmen football players and non-football players, and low income and non low-income football players. The lower income students are read to less, enjoy reading less, perform worse in high school [...] despite how much they read [...] and in turn, are more likely to feel like they are not reading at a college level than their more affluent peers...|$|R
40|$|I plan {{to attempt}} to {{research}} {{the way of life}} of the lower classes/“average guy, ” preferably at some period between 600 and 1000 AD. I am especially interested in familial relationships, and the way that the harsh living conditions of the period affected family structure and relationships. If possible, I will limit my research to one geographic region, but the feasibility of this will depend on the amount of source-material I can find dealing with any specific region in a specific time period. If there is not enough source information, I will either cover a larger region in one time period or one region over a longer time span. I have looked through the Medieval Internet Sourcebook fairly extensively, but have not recorded everything I found of interest on the sight in this bibliography. I have included the documents I plan to start with, but may return to the Sourcebook for more documents once <b>I</b> have <b>narrowed</b> <b>my</b> research area. <b>I</b> plan {{to do a lot of}} reading over Spring Break, so that when I return I will have a much better idea of the specific region and time period in which I will be working.

40|$|In my thesis, I {{have studied}} how Southern {{identity}} is formed through Southern leisure magazines, specifically Garden & Gun. <b>I</b> chose to <b>narrow</b> <b>my</b> focus by choosing to look {{only at the}} 2014 editions of the magazine, and I also looked primarily at the food, alcohol, homes, and hunting sections {{in order to be}} concise. Through my research, I have discovered that the magazine, although trying to be inclusive for race and gender, struggles to accurately depict the South. Instead, the magazine focuses on the primarily white, upper classes of the region, which creates and imagined reality for the reader. But, while race is not represented in sections of the magazine, gender representation (for white men and women) is always equal While researching, I discovered that in the food section of the magazine, Garden & Gun allows the kitchen to become an inclusive domain by representing men and women, white and black, equally alongside one another. So, this means that Garden & Gun, while trying to be inclusive for everyone, is unable to expand the acceptance to other sections of the magazine. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{present day}} {{atmosphere}} {{seems to be}} so much about one or the other. Whether it is politics, religion, or even something as small as Apple or PC, it seems like it is impossible to exist in the middle; you either 2 ̆ 2 are 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 are not. 2 ̆ 2 With the blinders firmly strapped on, there is so much not coming into view. By only seeing things in absolutes, is what we DO NOT experience and believe as important as what we DO? This is a cumbersome question without a simple yes or no answer. However, rather than attempting to create some kind of resolution, this thesis attempts to reframe this question (in a broader sense) in an effort to remove the blinders and experience things beyond ourselves. More specifically, it attempts to shift the focus from 2 ̆ 2 I 2 ̆ 2 to 2 ̆ 2 We 2 ̆ 2 and how inextricable these two are in defining and understanding each other. Because there are so many facets to this issue, <b>I</b> <b>narrowed</b> <b>my</b> focus on one aspect - gender. I also provided context for the body of work by framing it specifically as a marriage ceremony. Each piece makes a statement on its own, but this statement is made stronger be presenting it with its companion piece. For example, the piece entitled Intimate I, a girdle made of nails and a carriage bolt, is visually powerful on its own and presents clear tension between male and female contexts and materials. However, when paired with the piece Intimate II, an athletic supporter made from straight pins, the presentation becomes more complex and less one-sided. Both gender roles are literally standing {{right in front of the}} viewer, side by side with equal importance. While the viewer expectedly draws on their personal history to interpret what they are seeing, the 2 ̆ 2 other 2 ̆ 2 is also right there, on display for them to experience as well. One cannot shift the social focus centuries in the making by displaying a few pieces of art in a gallery and writing a few words. But hopefully this thesis does call on us to take pause. We stop for a moment to take in a little humanism in a post-humanist age in hopes that it opens the door a crack. Perhaps it lets enough light in to start to question what we think we know about ourselves and ultimately the whole of humanity...|$|R
40|$|During my {{undergraduate}} {{career at}} Eastern Michigan University, I {{have had the}} privilege to study various aspects of public higher education through my public administration degree work. Most of that work {{has focused on the}} state of Michigan alone, giving me only one perspective on the inner workings of state colleges and universities. By the beginning of my final year, there were many questions that I had yet to answer because of my “domestic ” focus on Michigan. Why are there so many schools in the state of Wisconsin that are called the University of Wisconsin? Are all universities independent from each other like the ones in Michigan are? Does any university allow students on its Board of Regents? This senior thesis is my opportunity to research and learn the answers to many of my questions regarding public higher education. Since many of my questions are quite vague and have expansive responses, <b>I</b> have <b>narrowed</b> <b>my</b> study down to three case-study states: Wisconsin, Ohio, and Michigan. I also have ruled out any institutions that are not 4 -year universities, in order to focus my analysis. Including the 2 -year colleges and other institutions would lead this study into other directions that would not fit into the scope of my questions. Each of the three states has a distinct method of administering its public institutions of higher education. I will begin this study with rationale for choosing these three states as the paradigm for my research. Since many of my questions are of...|$|R
40|$|The {{ideas and}} events that {{surround}} alcoholism in American literature constitute grounds for a reevaluation. To make a modest dent in this subject, <b>I</b> have <b>narrowed</b> <b>my</b> focus to a small body of canonical works by Edgar Allan Poe and Harriet Beecher Stowe. My chief area of inquiry is how alcohol as a topic, as structural motif, and as metaphor serves these writers 2 ̆ 7 literary productions. A subordinate aim is {{an investigation of the}} inadequacy of criticism on the subject, and what contribution our current understanding of alcoholism, its moral, environmental, and hereditary shadings can make to a reinterpretation of major works by these two writers. ^ The biographies in chapters one and three that precede the interpretive work in chapters two and four permit me to address the vital intersection of the respective writer 2 ̆ 7 s life and work, specifically each artist 2 ̆ 7 s concern with alcohol and its place in his or her oeuvre. With a twentieth century social and scientific understanding of alcoholism, its wide ranging traits, often invisible because of its gradual progressiveness, and the drinker 2 ̆ 7 s denial syndromes, this study decodes, in many instances, the fiction writer 2 ̆ 7 s deliberately masked discussion of alcohol and character. The dissertation indicates how an alignment of alcohol and art with scientific and socio-historic thought in the nineteenth century contributes significantly to our textual understanding of the work of Poe and Stowe, how the short story and (or) novel were their testing grounds for the subject of drink, and how it devilled, drove, and confounded their fictive characters. ...|$|R
40|$|Contempt {{and shame}} {{go hand in}} hand. Actions that should shame us, styles of self-presentation that should humiliate us if we are {{socially}} competent enough {{to have such a}} purchase on ourselves, are those actions and styles that generate and justify the contempt of others for us. Or, changing the causal order: one 2 ̆ 7 s contempt of us will generate shame or humiliation in us if we concur with the judgment of our contemptibility, that is, if the contempt is justified, or indignation and even vengeful fury if it is unjustified. Contempt is thus a mechanism of ranking people or of contesting relative rankings and as such has an intensely political significance. Contempt raises a myriad of issues involving the relation of emotions to various social orders, to the justice of those social orders, and to the micro- politics of face-to-face interaction in those social orders. <b>I</b> want to <b>narrow</b> <b>my</b> range here. What I wish to speculate about is the nature of something I will call upward contempt, that is, the contempt that the low have for the high; I will then make some suggestions about how this might play out in different social and political regimes: heroic society, the ancien regime, and in democracy...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of authenticity and sincerity in the public imagination, sociological investigation has been stymied by the murkiness of these concepts. In this dissertation, I clarify these concepts and situate them in a broader empirical literature. <b>I</b> then <b>narrow</b> <b>my</b> focus to investigate three questions related to the causes, consequences, and mediating role of perceived sincerity: What {{is the impact of}} perceived sincerity in exchange relationships? What informs these perceptions? And how does the study of perceived sincerity advance existing theoretical work in social exchange? I argue that prior explanations of reciprocity that refer to the norm of reciprocity fail to address the peculiarly human ability to perceive sincerity-i. e. to distinguish between others' behavior and the ostensible motives that underlie others' behavior. To address this shortcoming, I develop and test a theory predicting that perceptions of sincerity or the lack thereof have lasting consequences for the cohesion of emerging relationships. I also predict that recipients' own dispositions, as well as the prevailing organizational culture, are critical determinants of perceived sincerity, informing the intentions that recipients ascribe to favor givers. Using a combination of experimental, interview, and survey data collected in the United States, India, and China, I find that 1) cohesion between exchange partners is far more contingent on perceived intentions than the observable "mechanics" of exchange emphasized in traditional explanations of reciprocity, and 2) those holding prosocial values reciprocate more than those adhering to proself values, yet not because prosocial values suggest a general selflessness, but because they are associated with a greater tendency for perceiving others as sincere. Taken together, these findings constitute a social cognitive perspective of reciprocity that helps explain the development of long term solidarity in dyadic relationships, with implications for the study of teamwork and organizational behavior, institutions, and social networks more broadly. 2018 - 05 - 2...|$|R
40|$|While it is {{generally}} accepted in Germany that migration, immigration, and integration are key social issues {{that must be addressed}} in the 21 st century, the idea of adding racism to this litany {{is generally}} rejected. This omission prevents both recognition and analysis of the implicit ways the “logic” of race is inscribed onto conceptions and discussions of culture, nationality, and citizenship. Contemporary images of Black bodies seen in German art institutions and popular media, including the use of Blackface, most pointedly demonstrate this phenomenon. This dissertation, informed by 15 months of ethnographic research in Berlin, Germany, and Europe, intervenes into this silence about race by examining how Blackness is depicted in European public culture. Informed by the theoretical framings of Black Studies and Decolonial Studies, I argue that European public culture demonstrates how a normative, racialized white European subject is constructed through anti-Blackness. Understanding anti-Blackness as the fulcrum by which Western modernity emerged, and best understanding it as a structuring grammar of Western society that depends on a racialized hierarchical ordering of human beings—here understood as coloniality— I embark on an ethnography of racial formation. In so doing, I explore the analytical benefits of conceiving of Blackness as an object of knowledge, rather than a subject of fact. <b>I</b> then <b>narrow</b> <b>my</b> focus to non-mainstream art spaces in Berlin arguing that, and examining why, they are places that both perpetuate and challenge hierarchical ideas and practices of race. In such spaces of culture, I forward the idea that ethnography allows us to highlight “the shadows” of coloniality. I argue that this in turn provides a needed articulation of coloniality and anti-Black racism in German and European society in and of itself, and not explicated through theories of political economy, secularism, or nationalism...|$|R
