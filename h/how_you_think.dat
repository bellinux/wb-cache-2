To escape the pressures of London, the family moved to rural Down House in September. On 11 January 1844, Darwin mentioned his theorising to the botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker, writing with melodramatic humour [...] "it is like confessing a murder". Hooker replied [...] "There may in my opinion have been a series of productions on different spots, & also a gradual change of species. I shall be delighted to hear <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that this change may have taken place, as no presently conceived opinions satisfy me on the subject." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Natalie Nichols of the Los Angeles Times, {{the lyrics}} of [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] {{reference}} a state of romantic obsession. Beyoncé said that the song talks [...] "about how, when you are falling in love, you {{do things that are}} out of character and you do not really care because you are just open." [...] Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] has [...] "such a cauldron of energy," [...] that Beyoncé sounds [...] "loose and sexy," [...] gripped by emotions she [...] "can neither understand nor control." [...] The lyrics are composed in the traditional verse-chorus form. Jay Z opens the song with a brief spoken verse-rap, containing the lyrics: [...] "Yes! So crazy right now. Most incredibly, it's your girl, B. It's your boy, Young. You ready?" [...] After Beyoncé delivers the [...] "uh-oh, uh-oh" [...] catchphrase, Jay Z continues the monologue. Beyoncé begins the first verse, followed with the whistle-backed chorus. She repeats the [...] "uh-oh, uh-oh" [...] phrase, leading to the second verse. The chorus follows, giving way to the second verse-rap which contains the lyrics: [...] "Jay Z in the range, crazy and deranged [...] I been inhaling the chain smokers, <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I got the name 'Hova', I been real and the game's over". The song continues to the bridge, singing: [...] "I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this, / I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care / 'Cuz your love's got the best of me, / And baby, you're making a fool of me, / You got me sprung and I don't care who sees." [...] She then sings the chorus again and the song fades out with the horns.|$|E

The podcasts vary greatly in length of time, anywhere from 8 minutes to over 4 hours. The podcast has no regular release schedule, although the frequency of releases has increased over time.

2500|$|Darwin {{became a}} close friend of the {{botanist}} Joseph Dalton Hooker, and on 11 January 1844 wrote to with melodramatic humour that he was [...] "almost convinced (quite contrary to opinion I started with) that species are not (it is like confessing a murder) immutable. Heaven forfend me from Lamarck nonsense of a [...] "tendency to progression" [...] “adaptations from the slow willing of animals" [...] ,—but the conclusions I am led to are not widely different from his—though the means of change are wholly so— I think I have found out (here's presumption!) the simple way by which species become exquisitely adapted to various ends." [...] Hooker's reply was cautious but friendly, saying that [...] "There may in my opinion have been a series of productions on different spots, & also a gradual change of species. I shall be delighted to hear <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that this change may have taken place, as no presently conceived opinions satisfy me on the subject." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{films are}} usually imaginative fantasies. His long-time co-writer Charles McKeown commented, [...] "the theme of imagination, and the {{importance}} of imagination, to how you live and <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> and so on... that's very much a Terry theme." [...] Most of Gilliam's movies include plotlines that seem to occur partly or completely in the characters' imaginations, raising questions about the definition of identity and sanity. He often shows his opposition to bureaucracy and authoritarian regimes. He also distinguishes [...] "higher" [...] and [...] "lower" [...] layers of society, with a disturbing and ironic style. His movies usually feature a fight or struggle against a great power which may be an emotional situation, a human-made idol, or even the person himself, and the situations do not always end happily. There is often a dark, paranoid atmosphere and unusual characters who used to be normal members of society. His scripts feature black comedy and often end with a dark tragicomic twist.|$|E

2500|$|Early in 1842, Darwin {{wrote about}} his ideas to Lyell, who noted that his ally [...] "denies seeing a {{beginning}} to each crop of species". On 11 January 1844 Darwin mentioned his theorising to the botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker, writing with melodramatic humour [...] "I am almost convinced (quite contrary to opinion I started with) that species are not (it is like confessing a murder) immutable.

2500|$|Director Terry Gilliam and screenwriter Charles McKeown {{wrote the}} script for The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, their first {{collaboration}} since The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988). When he was approached with the basic concept by Gilliam, McKeown thought of the central character of Parnassus [...] "as a semi-eastern medicine man evolved", and in retrospect he further said about the script's sensibilities, [...] "t is about the theme of imagination, {{and the importance of}} imagination, to how you live and <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> and so on. And that's very much a Terry theme. [...] I like the idea of storytelling being the thing that sustains the universe." [...] Gilliam described the premise as a [...] "fun and humorous story about the consequences of our personal choices in life", and explained his goal for the film: [...] "It's autobiographical. I'm trying to bring a bit of fantasticality to London, an antidote to modern lives. I loved this idea of an ancient travelling show offering the kind of storytelling and wonder that we used to get, to people who are just into shoot-em-up action films." [...] Gilliam and McKeown based the character of Tony on former British prime minister Tony Blair, who [...] "would say the most insane things and probably he'd believe them himself".|$|E
