The main goal of the project has been to replace the traditional methods that the Swedish Armed Forces are using today to find firing solutions for their mortar, the GRK m/ 84. A computational core has been written in Java that simulates the trajectory of a shell using the model in NATO's STANAG 4355. The developed system finds firing solutions by using shooting methods and the multi-dimensional Newton Raphson's method. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) tailored to mobile computers has been designed in Android. The computational core along with the GUI has been installed on a rugged <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> <b>computer</b> and the whole unit has been tested at Markstridsskolan (MSS). The tests showed that the computational core delivers firing solutions that coincide very well with the actual firing solutions needed to hit the desired target...|$|R

The family practice clerkship at Washington University in St. Louis has tried a series of structured paper and <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> <b>computer</b> logs in search of a format that permits students to completely document their patients' diagnoses. The clerkship introduced a Palm computer log, designed with PumaTech's Satellite forms (R), that uses patient demographics to select a diagnosis entry screen displaying many likely diagnoses as checkboxes. Additional drop lists and combinations of drop lists provide access to less common diagnoses. Students using this log document 2. 4 problems per patient on average, and as many as 14 problems in a single patient. Differences between students and preceptors are readily apparent. It is now possible to prepare students to rotate with specific preceptors, and to identify or predict gaps in experience that deserve remedial intervention...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The use of {{handheld}} {{computers in}} medicine {{has increased in}} the last decade, they are now used {{in a variety of}} clinical settings. There is an underlying assumption that electronic data capture is more accurate that paper-based data methods have been rarely tested. This report documents a study to compare the accuracy of hand held computer data capture versus more traditional paper-based methods. Methods Clinical nurses involved in a randomised controlled trial collected patient information on a hand held computer in parallel with a paper-based data form. Both sets of data were entered into an access database and the hand held computer data compared to the paper-based data for discrepancies. Results Error rates from the handheld computers were 67. 5 error per 1000 fields, compared to the accepted error rate of 10 per 10, 000 field for paper-based double data entry. Error rates were highest in field containing a default value. Conclusion While popular with staff, unacceptable high error rates occurred with <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> <b>computers.</b> Training and ongoing monitoring are needed if <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> <b>computers</b> are to be used for clinical data collection. </p...|$|E
40|$|Handoff is the {{procedure}} {{by which a}} user's radio link is transferred between radio ports in the network without an interruption of the user connection. In this paper, we discuss how a Wireless Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network may reroute a user connection during a handoff. We propose a novel procedure called "Nearest Common Node Rerouting (NCNR). " NCNR is designed to perform the rerouting of user connections due to a handoff event in a fast and efficient manner. We conclude by comparing NCNR to other rerouting schemes discussed in the literature. 1 Introduction The rise of the wireless communications paired with the rapid developments in Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networking technology signals {{the start of a}} new era in which the users will not only need higher bandwidth but they will also demand mobility.

40|$|Development of {{geographic}} information systems for mobile and <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> <b>computer</b> devices requires significantly modified approach {{in comparison to}} development of more traditional GISs. Main issues to be addressed are efficient handling of limited memory and processing power, appropriate management and presentation of information on highly restricted devices and design of appropriate user interfaces. User interface design is rarely discussed in research but can significantly impact usability of the system. Communication of data and commands between a user and an application is explicit in most traditional user interface designs. This has the effect that information concerning environment of the user mostly remains unused or has to be formalized by the user. In the mobile environment {{the goal is to}} reduce workload for the user and automate, as much as possible, the process of application adaptation to the operating environment conditions. This paper presents basic categorization of context and data structures and algorithms developed for automated context management, interpretation and usage in an application based on mobile GIS application framework...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Using {{technology}} to access clinical information {{has become a}} critical skill for family physicians. The aims {{of this study were}} to assess the way family physicians use the Internet to look for clinical information and how their patterns vary from those of specialists. Further, we sought {{a better understanding of how}} family physicians used just-in-time information in clinical practice. Methods A fax survey was provided with 17 items. The survey instrument, adapted from two previous studies, was sent to community-based physicians. The questions measured frequency of use and importance of the Internet, palm computers, Internet CME, and email for information seeking and CME. Barriers to use were explored. Demographic data was gathered concerning gender, years since medical school graduation, practice location, practice type, and practice specialty. Results Family physicians found the Internet to be useful and important as an information source. They were more likely to search for patient oriented material than were specialists who more often searched literature, journals and corresponded with colleagues. <b>Hand</b> <b>held</b> <b>computers</b> were used by almost half of family physicians. Conclusion Family physicians consider the Internet important to the practice of medicine, and the majority use it regularly. Their searches differ from colleagues in other specialties with a focus on direct patient care questions.

Tridbit technology processes natural language directly into tridbits, which are the underlying knowledge structure for retrieving, storing and reasoning with information. The efficiency of the system derives from exploiting the inherent constraints of the tridbit structure and harmonizing various aspects of natural language processing with it. The system requires very little pre-defined knowledge, instead building grammatical and world knowledge from natural language interaction.
