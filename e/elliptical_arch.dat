At the two ends of the arcade, four prominent statues represent London, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Dublin depicting bronze dragons charged with the City's armorial bearings. At {{the corners of the}} market four octagonal pavilion towers were built, each with a dome displaying carved stone griffins.|$|E
25|$|The railway {{line between}} Boston and Skegness {{crosses to the}} north bank, and then follows {{the course of the}} river to below Wainfleet All Saints. The next bridge is Clough's Bridge, {{carrying}} a minor road over the main channel. Just before it, the old course of the Lymn leaves the straight channel of the Steeping River. It is no longer connected to the Steeping River, but is maintained as a drainage ditch by the Internal Drainage Board (IDB). Warth's Bridge and Thorpe Culvert Bridge follow, both roads leading to Thorpe Culvert railway station. Thorpe Culvert pumping station, owned by the IDB, is located just before the second bridge, and after it, the Wainfleet Relief Channel turns off, passing under the railway almost immediately. There are two more bridges as the main channel crosses Wainfleet Common, Bycroft's Bridge and Crow's Bridge. Crow's Bridge has an <b>elliptical</b> <b>arch</b> constructed of red bricks, and was designed by the engineer John Rennie in 1812. Salem Bridge carries the B1195 road to Wainfleet railway station, and the A52 road crosses to the east of Wainfleet All Saints. The channel is now also called Wainfleet Haven, and both names are used to describe it until it reaches the sea.|$|E
500|$|The Avon Valley between Bradford on Avon and Bath is {{a classic}} {{geographical}} example of a valley where four forms of ground transport are found: road, rail, river, canal. The river passes under the Avoncliff and Dundas Aqueducts and at Freshford is joined by the Somerset River Frome. Avoncliff Aqueduct was built by John Rennie and chief engineer John Thomas, between 1797 and 1801. The aqueduct consists of three arches and is [...] long with a central <b>elliptical</b> <b>arch</b> of [...] span with two side arches each semicircular and [...] across, all with V-jointed arch stones. The spandrel and wing walls are built in alternate courses of ashlar masonry, and rock-faced blocks. The central span sagged soon after it was built and has been repaired many times. The Dundas Aqueduct was built by the same team between 1797 and 1801 and completed in 1805. James McIlquham was appointed contractor. The aqueduct is [...] long with three arches built of Bath Stone, with Doric pilasters, and balustrades at each end. The central semicircular arch spans the two oval side arches span [...] It is a grade I listed building, {{and was the first}} canal structure to be designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1951. The stretch of river below and above the aqueduct, where it is joined by Midford Brook, is used by the Bluefriars of the Monkton Combe School Boat Club up to six days a week since at least the 1960s.|$|E

2500|$|Nanneys Bridge {{carries the}} B5074 road over the canal just before Minshull Lock. It {{is made of}} brick with a single basket arch, but the {{parapets}} are not original, {{as they have been}} rebuilt. The lock raises the canal by , and is grade II listed because it shows few signs of having been altered since its construction. Bridge 5A carries the railway line from Crewe to Chester over the canal, and there is a large marina shortly afterwards, followed by Cholmondeston lock, which raises the level by [...] Benyon's Bridge, Sandholes Bridge, and Rutters Bridge are the final three accommodation bridges, before the canal arrives at Barbridge Junction, where a graceful roving bridge made of red and blue brick with an <b>elliptical</b> <b>arch,</b> carries the towpath for the main line over the branch.|$|E
2500|$|The {{structure}} is [...] long, and {{reaches a maximum}} height of [...] above {{the floor of the}} valley. [...] It consists of 26semi-circular arches each of [...] with piers of [...] thick at the base and [...] thick at the top, together with one <b>elliptical</b> <b>arch</b> of [...] over a section of the A23 London Road called Preston Road. [...] The piers of this arch are [...] thick at the base and [...] thick at the top. [...] Each pier contains a jack arch with a semi-circular soffitt and invert {{to reduce the number of}} bricks required. [...] The piers are thicker on the outside than on the inside because the viaduct is constructed on a sharp curve: trains reach the viaduct almost immediately after leaving the Brighton Main Line, and the line continues to curve away for several hundred metres. [...] Of the 27arches, 16have a radius of curvature of , and 11have a radius of [...]|$|E
2500|$|The river has two sources, {{both in the}} low {{ridge of}} Jurassic rocks in {{the west of the}} county. The East Glen rises as a number of small streams near to Ropsley and Humby, close to the [...] contour. It flows in a southerly direction, passing to the east of Ingoldsby and to the west of Bulby, to arrive at Edenham. The East Glen is {{sometimes}} called the River Eden, derived as a back-formation from its passing through the parish of Edenham. It continues south through Toft, where a Grade II listed bridge built in the early 1800s crosses, and Manthorpe, where there is another listed bridge with a single <b>elliptical</b> <b>arch</b> built in 1813, before turning east to join the West Glen at Wilsthorpe, Lincolnshire. The West Glen also has a number of sources, near to the [...] contour at Old Somerby and Boothby Pagnall. It flows more or less parallel to the East Glen, passing through Bitchfield, Burton-le-Coggles, Corby Glen and Creeton to reach Essendine, where it turns east towards Greatford. In the village, a two-arched stone bridge built in the late 1700s carries Church Lane over the river.|$|E

2500|$|For {{the larger}} of the two bridges in the city, Green's Bridge, Smith {{designed}} almost a true copy of [...] Bridge of Tiberius (...) in Rimini, as described by Andrea Palladio's (1508–1580) in I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura (1570) (The Four Books of Architecture). Built with rubble limestone, Smith's design incorporated five <b>elliptical</b> <b>arches</b> with cut-limestone Gibbs surrounds and dressed squared limestone soffits. With three central arches and two smaller arches it is decorated with pedimented aedicules and doric columns. It has tooled limestone ashlar triangular cut-waters. [...] Renovated with two random rubble limestone parapets with coping were added in 1835. As well as the five arches there is also a pair of <b>elliptical</b> <b>arches</b> over culvert (one blocked-up with concrete block infill).|$|R
2500|$|Next {{it turns}} to the south, passing through Baggy Moor, where it is joined by {{a large number of}} {{drainage}} ditches. The railway line crosses it again, before it reaches Ruyton-XI-Towns, where there is a large loop around higher ground to the east. The river is crossed by Platt Mill Bridge, designed and built in 1791 by Edward Cureton. The river forms the border between civil parishes at this point, and so one half of the bridge is in Ruyton-XI-Towns, while the other is in Baschurch. The bridge has two arches, and is a grade II listed structure. A circular toll-house, built of red sandstone with a conical slate roof, was erected in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century close to the bridge, and is now used as a house. Continuing to the south-west of Baschurch, Milford Bridge is another two-arched structure, which carries the Baschurch to Little Ness road over the river. It was designed by Thomas Stanton in 1831, and was built by Nathaniel Edwards. Stanton was the civil engineer Thomas Telford's deputy at the time, when Telford was the County Surveyor of Bridges for Shropshire. The river passes along the south-western edge of Yeaton Peverey parkland, to reach Forton Heath, where there is a bridge with a single <b>elliptical</b> <b>arch,</b> built in the early nineteenth century, which carries the Mytton to Forton road. Below the bridge, the river joins the River Severn, close to the [...] contour. The junction is not far from Shrewsbury, but the course of the Severn is much longer, as it flows around several large meanders to reach the town.|$|E
2500|$|The facades {{are similar}} with regular door and window {{openings}} and with small balconies to the second-floor openings. There {{is a small}} partial false gable roof of Spanish barrel red-clay tiles around the four sides and around the courtyard. On the front (south) facade, facing the ocean, there are five bays with a large elliptical arch-headed passageway large enough for vehicular traffic. It is architecturally marked only by a plain, flat frame painted differently {{from the body of}} the building. There are plain board, double doors with a smaller pedestrian port in the right door. In the <b>elliptical</b> <b>arch</b> there is a simple fanlight window. Flanking the arched entrance are two large high windows on each side. The windows are two-leaf casements with exterior solid and Jouvered combination paneled shutters. Metal grilles are at each window. The walls have a simple low projecting base course, and the first floor walls are marked by horizontal incised coursing, all in stucco. There is a large molded string course between stories and on the second floor, five door openings, each with double-leaf doors that are half sash, which replaced the original louvered and paneled shutter combinations. Over the doors are sashed transoms, although the right group has been replaced by air conditioners. Each opening has a decorative wrought iron balcony with scroll support dating from the U.S. remodeling of the building. Previous to these wrought-iron balconies, the building had cast iron railings. [...] "U.S. Customs" [...] is lettered over the central window. At the top is a large double masonry molded cornice, surmounted by the small false partial gable in Spanish tiles, both from 1924. On the front only, there are three flag poles on the roof, and a large antenna system. On each side of the first floor passage entry is an alarm box and a plain light fixture.|$|E
