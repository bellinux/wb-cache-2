25|$|This {{valuation}} mode {{is typically}} used to value regulated storage, for instance storage operated by <b>interstate</b> <b>pipeline</b> companies. These companies are regulated by FERC. This pricing method allows the developers to recover their cost and an agreed upon return on investment.

The services provided by these companies include firm and interruptible storage as well as no-notice storage services. Usually, cost of service pricing is used for depleted reservoir facilities.

FERC regulations though demand that these companies open up the remainder of their capacity not used for that purpose to third parties. Twenty-five interstate companies currently operate 172 underground natural gas storage facilities. In 2005, their facilities accounted for about 43 percent of overall storage deliverability and 55 percent of working gas capacity in the US. These operators include the Columbia Gas Transmission Company, Dominion Gas Transmission Company, The National Fuel Gas Supply Company, Natural Gas Pipeline of America, Texas Gas Transmission Company, Southern Star Central Pipeline Company, TransCanada Corporation.|$|E

50|$|The prices {{charged by}} {{utilities}} delivering {{natural gas to}} customers have always been subject to state regulation. With the construction of <b>interstate</b> gas <b>pipelines</b> in the 1920s and 1930s, city utilities became dependent on natural gas supplies beyond the regulatory power {{of state and local}} governments. In 1935, the federal trade commission, believing that <b>interstate</b> <b>pipelines</b> had too much power to control the downstream gas market, recommended federal controls.

2500|$|The court heard {{argument}} on April 6–7, 1954. Justice Sherman Minton {{noted that in}} Federal Power Commission v. Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co., 337 U.S. 498, 337 U.S. 505, the Supreme Court wrote that the [...] "natural and clear meaning" [...] of the phrase [...] "production or gathering of natural gas" [...] is that it encompasses [...] "the producing properties and gathering facilities of a natural gas company." [...] The court read the exemption as not applying to gas sales. Minton's opinion noted, [...] "the legislative history indicates a congressional intent to give the Commission jurisdiction over the rates of all wholesales of natural gas in interstate commerce, whether by a pipeline company or not and whether occurring before, during, or after transmission by an <b>interstate</b> <b>pipeline</b> company. There can be no dispute that the overriding congressional purpose was to plug the 'gap' in regulation of natural gas companies...." [...] Minton justified asserting jurisdiction over wellhead sales because, [...] "Protection of consumers against exploitation {{at the hands of}} natural gas companies was the primary aim of the Natural Gas Act." [...] Further, Minton noted that Congress had failed to pass bills that proposed to amend the law to clearly exempt wellhead sales.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Interstate</b> <b>pipeline</b> {{companies}} in the US {{are subject to the}} jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Prior to 1992, these companies owned all the gas that flowed through their systems. This also included gas in their storage facility, over which they had complete control. Then FERC Order 636 was implemented. This required the companies to operate their facilities, including gas storage on an open access basis. For gas storage, this meant that these companies could only reserve the capacity needed to maintain system integrity. The rest of the capacity would be available for leasing to third parties on a nondiscriminatory basis. Open access has opened a wide variety of application for gas storage, particularly for marketers which can now exploit price arbitrage opportunities. Any storage capacity would be priced at cost-based pricing, unless the provider can demonstrate to FERC that it lacks market power, in which case it may be allowed to price at market-based rates to gain market share. FERC defines market power as [...] "..the ability of a seller profitably to maintain prices above competitive levels for a significant period of time.". The underlying pricing structure for storage has discouraged development in the gas storage sector, which has not seen many new storage facilities constructed, besides current ones being expanded. In 2005, FERC announced a new Order 678 targeted particularly to gas storage. This rule is intended to stimulate the development of new gas storage facility in the ultimate goal of reducing natural gas price volatility. Commission Chairman Joseph T. Kelliher observed: [...] "Since 1988, natural gas demand in the United States has risen 24 percent. Over the same period, gas storage capacity has increased only 1.4 percent. While construction of storage capacity has lagged behind the demand for natural gas, we have seen record levels of price volatility. This suggests that current storage capacity is inadequate. Further, this year, what storage capacity exists may be full far earlier than in any previous year. According to some analysts, that raises the prospect that some domestic gas production may be shut-in. Our final rule should help reduce price volatility and expand storage capacity." ...|$|E
