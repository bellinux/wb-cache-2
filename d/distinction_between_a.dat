5|$|Ponies are taxonomically {{the same}} animals as horses. The <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> horse and pony is {{commonly}} {{drawn on the}} basis of height, especially for competition purposes. However, height alone is not dispositive; the difference between horses and ponies may also include aspects of phenotype, including conformation and temperament.|$|E
5|$|One {{definition}} of a sub-brown dwarf is a planet-mass object that formed through cloud collapse rather than accretion. This formation <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> sub-brown dwarf and a planet is not universally agreed upon; astronomers are divided into two camps as whether to consider the formation process of a planet {{as part of its}} division in classification. One reason for the dissent is that often it may not be possible to determine the formation process. For example, a planet formed by accretion around a star may get ejected from the system to become free-floating, and likewise a sub-brown dwarf that formed on its own in a star cluster through cloud collapse may get captured into orbit around a star.|$|E

5|$|Williams {{argued that}} there is a crucial <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> person being killed by Jim, and being killed by the captain because of an act or {{omission}} of Jim's. The captain, if he chooses to kill, is not simply the medium of an effect Jim is having on the world. He is the moral actor, the person with the intentions and projects. The utilitarian loses that distinction, turning us into empty vessels by means of which consequences occur. Williams argued that moral decisions must preserve our psychological identity and integrity. We should reject any system that reduces moral decisions to a few algorithms.|$|E
5|$|Battlecruisers {{served in}} the navies of the UK, Germany, the Ottoman Empire, Australia and Japan during World War I, most notably at the Battle of the Falkland Islands and in the several raids and skirmishes in the North Sea which culminated in a pitched fleet battle, the Battle of Jutland. British battlecruisers in {{particular}} suffered heavy losses at Jutland, where their light armour made them very vulnerable to large-caliber shells. By {{the end of the}} war, capital ship design had developed with battleships becoming faster and battlecruisers becoming more heavily armoured, blurring the <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> battlecruiser and a fast battleship. The Washington Naval Treaty, which limited capital ship construction from 1922 onwards, treated battleships and battlecruisers identically, and the new generation of battlecruisers planned was scrapped {{under the terms of the}} treaty.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of discrete inheritable units was first suggested by Gregor Mendel (1822–1884). From 1857 to 1864, in Brno (Czech Republic), he studied inheritance patterns in 8000 common edible pea plants, tracking distinct traits from parent to offspring. He described these mathematically as 2ncombinations where n {{is the number}} of differing characteristics in the original peas. Although he did not use the term gene, he explained his results in terms of discrete inherited units that give rise to observable physical characteristics. This description prefigured Wilhelm Johannsen's distinction between genotype (the genetic material of an organism) and phenotype (the visible traits of that organism). Mendel was also the first to demonstrate independent assortment, the distinction between dominant and recessive traits, the <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> heterozygote and homozygote, and the phenomenon of discontinuous inheritance.|$|E

5|$|There is a <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> {{redshift}} in cosmological context {{as compared}} to that witnessed when nearby objects exhibit a local Doppler-effect redshift. Rather than cosmological redshifts being {{a consequence of the}} relative velocities that are subject to the laws of special relativity (and thus subject to the rule that no two locally separated objects can have relative velocities with respect to each other faster than the speed of light), the photons instead increase in wavelength and redshift because of a global feature of the spacetime metric through which they are traveling. One interpretation of this effect is the idea that space itself is expanding. Due to the expansion increasing as distances increase, the distance between two remote galaxies can increase at more than 3 m/s, but this does not imply that the galaxies move faster than the speed of light at their present location (which is forbidden by Lorentz covariance).|$|E

25|$|The <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> {{good and}} a service remains disputed.
