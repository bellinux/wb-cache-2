40|$|In {{the present}} {{investigation}} a comparative analysis of the Free radical scavenging potential and analgesic activity of the Ethanolic Leaf (ELS) and stem extracts (ESS) of Solanum nigrum was performed. The extracts were evaluated for its DPPH and hydroxyl free radicals scavenging effect and inhibitory potential on protein carbonyl formation. Total phenolic and flavonoid content of the extracts were also determined by a colorimetric method. The ethanolic extracts of Solanum nigrum were evaluated for its peripheral analgesic activity by Acetic-acid induced writhing response and central analgesic activity by Tail flicking method and Hot plate method in mice. Both the plant extracts scavenged the free radicals in a dose dependent manner. However the scavenging effect was more pronounced in ELS extract when comparable <b>to</b> <b>ESS</b> extract. Both the extract possessed considerable quantity of phenols and flavonoids. In Tail flicking and Hot plate methods the ELS extract of Solanum nigrum showed higher mean basal latency time when comparable <b>to</b> <b>ESS</b> extract suggesting its central analgesic activity. Similarly in Acetic acid induced writhing response the ELS extract exhibited a significant inhibition of writhing 53. 28 % when comparable <b>to</b> <b>ESS</b> which exhibited an inhibition of 46. 53 %. The positive control Diclofenac sodium showed 70. 66 % of writhing inhibition. The analgesic activity of the plants extracts is probably due to its free radical scavenging activity...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To {{review and}} discuss recent {{literature}} {{regarding the use}} of antibiotics in relation to endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS), including perioperative antibiotics, postoperative antibiotics, and antibiotic usage in the setting of postoperative packing. RECENT FINDINGS: Perioperative antibiotics are not recommended by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists. The necessity of antibiotics following ESS is a heavily debated topic. Most studies show little to no improvement in outcomes. Significant improvement in quality-of-life outcomes and endoscopic scoring appears limited to the early postoperative period using conventional postoperative antibiotics. Prolonged macrolide therapy may improve long-term outcomes. There is no convincing evidence to show the need for antibiotics in the setting of postoperative packing. SUMMARY: The available evidence regarding antibiotic use in relation <b>to</b> <b>ESS</b> overall fails <b>to</b> demonstrate routine benefit; however, the studies have various limitations. Overall, future, well designed, large-scale prospective studies would be beneficial to direct appropriate antibiotic use, whether systemic or topical, in relation <b>to</b> <b>ESS...</b>|$|R

50|$|SR proteins' {{alternative}} splicing promoting activities are {{in contrast to}} those of hnRNPs. hnRNPs bind to exon splicing silencers, ESS, and inhibit the inclusion of exons, thus hnRNPs are splicing repressors. SR proteins and hnRNPs compete for binding <b>to</b> ESEs and <b>ESSs</b> sequences in exons. Binding is based on concentrations of SR proteins and hnRNPs in cells. If the cell has {{a high concentration of}} SR proteins then SR proteins are more likely to bind to ESEs compared to hnRNPs binding <b>to</b> <b>ESS.</b> If the cell has a high concentration of hnRNPs then hnRNPs can outcompete SR proteins for <b>ESSs</b> compared <b>to</b> ESEs.|$|R

30|$|Redispatch is {{a message}} sent by the {{transmission}} utility to power plants to amend the real power generation {{in order to avoid}} power congestion. By storing the extra real power output of wind farms <b>to</b> <b>ESS,</b> it is feasible to alleviate congestion while real power in the grid is maintained at rated value. On the other hand, the wind power curtailment, due to limited transmission capacity, can be mitigated by ESS. ESS can balance the generation- demand mismatch by storing and delivering power during peak and down load conditions respectively.|$|R
