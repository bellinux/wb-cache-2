5|$|A {{maximum of}} three Nobel laureates and two {{different}} works may be {{selected for the}} Nobel Prize in Physics. Compared with other Nobel Prizes, the nomination and selection process for the prize in Physics <b>is</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> rigorous. This is a key reason why it has grown in importance {{over the years to}} become the most important prize in Physics.|$|E
5|$|A {{medium-sized}} gray bat, Myotis escalerai {{is similar}} to Myotis nattereri. The fur <b>is</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> soft; with a brown tone on the back, and the brighter underparts approaching white. The feet are dark gray. Much of the face is pink, and the muzzle is pointed, with long hairs on the upper lip resembling a moustache. The long ears are brown to gray. The tragus, a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear, <b>is</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> reaches {{to the middle of the}} ear and colored gray to yellow, becoming darker from the base towards the tip. According to several authors, it differs from M.nattereri in showing a distinct fringe of hairs on the tail membrane, but bat specialist A.M. Hutson writes that this feature does not distinguish the two species. In addition, the presence of an S-shaped spur on the uropatagium (membrane between the hind legs), which approaches the middle of the membrane, is a distinctive feature of this species. With its broad wings, low flight, and rapid wingbeats, the species is capable of precise, agile flight.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} members of its genus, the red-throated loon is well adapted to its aquatic environment: its dense bones help it to submerge, its legs—in their {{set-back}} position—provide excellent propulsion, and its body <b>is</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> streamlined. Even its sharply pointed bill may help its underwater streamlining. Its feet are large, its front three toes are fully webbed, and its tarsus is flattened, which reduces drag and allows the leg to move easily through the water.|$|E
50|$|The fore limbs ("arms") <b>were</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> {{slender and}} bore {{powerful}} claws. The hind limbs <b>were</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> powerful, with a <b>long</b> foot <b>and</b> short, strong toes terminating in hooflike claws. Ornithomimosaurs were probably among the fastest of all dinosaurs. Like other coelurosaurs, the ornithomimosaurian hide was feathered rather than scaly.|$|R

5|$|Species of Voalavo are small, gray, mouse-like rodents, {{among the}} {{smallest}} nesomyines. They lack the distinctive tuft of long {{hairs on the}} tail that is characteristic of Eliurus. The tail <b>is</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> females have six mammae. In Voalavo, there are two glands on the chest (absent in Eliurus) that produce a sweet-smelling musk in breeding males. In the skull, the facial skeleton <b>is</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> the braincase is smooth. The incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate) are long and the bony palate itself is smooth. The molars are somewhat hypsodont (high-crowned), though less so than in Eliurus, and the third molars are reduced in size and complexity.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen <b>is</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> {{slender and}} {{consists}} of 10 segments and a terminal appendage-bearing segment. The second and third segments are enlarged, and in males, a cleft {{on the underside of}} the second segment contains a pair of claspers and the penis. The spermaries open on the 9th segment. In females, the genital opening is {{on the underside of the}} eighth segment and is covered by a simple flap or an ovipositor, depending on species and the method of egg-laying.|$|E
5|$|The head <b>is</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> strong, with a convex {{profile and}} thick, long ears. The neck <b>is</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> the {{shoulders}} are sloping. The chest is broad and deep, the withers prominent, the back long and broad, and the hindquarters strong. The legs are well developed and powerful, with large joints. The Poitevin has large hooves, {{an advantage in}} wet environments, as an adaptation to the alternately hard and waterlogged marshes upon which it developed. The lower legs are well feathered, and the mane and tail are long and thick. The Poitevin is gentle, calm and robust. Historically the breed {{has been known for}} its slow movement and disinterest in pulling, although it can produce significant power if necessary. The breed enjoys human contact, and shows intelligence, although it can also be stubborn. Prolonged effort is its weak point, as the Poitevin sometimes lack endurance.|$|E
50|$|Early stage larvae of Starksia {{are more}} tadpole-shaped than other labrisomids and lack {{some of the}} melanophores (dark spots) typical of the family. Juvenile Starksia atlantica <b>are</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> narrow, with large eyes. The mouth is {{at the tip of}} the pointed snout. Both the dorsal and anal fins run {{continuously}} for most of the length of the body. The pectoral fins <b>are</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> the pelvic fins have 2 spines <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> threadlike. The melanophores are few in number and occur at the base of the anal fin rays.|$|R
50|$|This {{plant is}} a long-climbing fern with thin black scales and stems that can reach up to 20 m. It has pinnate fronds that <b>are</b> 30-100 cm <b>long,</b> {{petioles}} that <b>are</b> 7-20 cm <b>long,</b> <b>and</b> ovate lanceolate pinnae that <b>are</b> 10-15 cm <b>long</b> <b>and</b> 1.5-4.5 cm wide. The fern's sporophylls <b>are</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> narrow, and have brownish sori undernwath.|$|R
50|$|Its arms <b>and</b> legs <b>are</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> slim. The {{arms are}} about 25% {{longer than the}} legs. The thumb is only vestigial, but the fingers <b>are</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> strong, making the hands hook-like. The <b>long</b> arms <b>and</b> hook-like hands allow Geoffroy's spider monkey to brachiate, that is, swing by its arms beneath the tree branches.|$|R
5|$|The list of {{distinguished}} scholars at the University of Oxford <b>is</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> includes {{many who have}} made major contributions to politics, the sciences, medicine, and literature. More than 50 Nobel laureates and more than 50 world leaders have been affiliated with the University of Oxford.|$|E
5|$|The {{mandible}} (lower jaw) <b>is</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> low. The coronoid process, the frontmost of {{the three}} main processes (projections) {{at the back of}} the jawbone, is large and about as high as the condyloid process behind it. The angular process, below the condyloid, is fairly short and does not extend further backwards than the condyloid. There is no noticeable capsular process (a raising {{at the back of the}} jaw that houses the root of the lower incisor).|$|E
5|$|The most {{distinctive}} feature of Saurolophus is its cranial crest, which {{is present in}} young individuals, but is smaller. It <b>is</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> spike-like and projects upward and backward at about a 45° angle, starting from over the eyes. This crest {{is often described as}} solid, but appears to be solid only at the point, with internal chambers that may have had a respiratory and/or heat-regulation function.|$|E

5|$|These lemurs have {{relatively}} long hindlegs. For gripping tree trunks and large branches, they have large {{hands and feet}} with extended pads on the digits, as well as claw-like nails. They have a long tongue which assists obtaining the gum and nectar, {{as well as a}} long caecum, which helps digest gums. Their procumbent (forward-facing) lemuriform toothcomb (formed by the lower incisors and canines) <b>is</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> more compressed, with significantly reduced interdental spaces to minimize the accumulation of gum between the teeth.|$|E
5|$|Diptera {{go through}} a {{complete}} metamorphosis with four distinct life stages – egg, larva, pupa and adult. In many flies, the larval stage <b>is</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> adults may have a short life. Most dipteran larvae develop in protected environments; many are aquatic and others are found in moist places such as carrion, fruit, vegetable matter, fungi and, {{in the case of}} parasitic species, inside their hosts. They tend to have thin cuticles and become desiccated if exposed to the air. Apart from the Brachycera, most dipteran larvae have sclerotinised head capsules, which may be reduced to remnant mouth hooks; the Brachycera, however, have soft, gelatinized head capsules from which the sclerites are reduced or missing. Many of these larvae retract their heads into their thorax.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) <b>is</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> robust. The nasal {{bones are}} short, not {{extending}} further back than the lacrimals, and the premaxillaries extend {{about as far}} back as the nasals. The zygomatic notch, an extension at the front of the zygomatic plate, is present. The plate's back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. A strong jugal bone is present in the zygomatic arch (cheekbone), so that the maxillary and squamosal bones, which form the front and back parts of the arch, respectively, do not overlap when seen from the side. The narrowest part of the interorbital region (located between the eyes) is to the front and the region's margins exhibit strong beading. Various crests develop on the rounded braincase, especially in old animals. The parietal bones form part of the roof of the braincase and, unlike in some other rice rats, also extend to the sides of the braincase. The interparietal bone at the back of the braincase is narrow and wedge-shaped, so that the parietal and occipital bones meet extensively.|$|E

5|$|Males have a long, {{straight}} penis with a notch {{between the}} shaft and the narrow, egg-shaped glans penis. Near the top, the penis is haired, but {{the base is}} almost naked. In the baculum (penis bone), the shaft <b>is</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> narrow and slightly curved. The length of the penis and baculum distinguish P.raceyi from all comparably sized African and Malagasy vespertilionids. P.endoi, P.paterculus, and P.abramus have more similar bacula, but that of P.abramus is more curved, the shaft and the tip are more robust in P.paterculus, and the proximal (near) end is more robust in P.endoi. In males, penis length is 9.6 to 11.8mm (0.38 to 0.46in) and baculum length is 8.8 to 10.0mm (0.35 to 0.39in).|$|E
5|$|Nemerteans lack {{specialized}} gills, and respiration occurs {{over the}} surface of the body, which <b>is</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> sometimes flattened. Like other animals with thick body walls, they use fluid circulation rather than diffusion to move substances through their bodies. The circulatory system consists of the rhynchocoel and peripheral vessels, while blood of other invertebrates is contained in the main body cavity. The fluid in the rhynchocoel moves substances to and from the proboscis, and functions as a fluid skeleton in everting the proboscis and in burrowing. The vessels circulate fluid round the whole body and the rhynchocoel provides its own local circulation. The circulatory vessels are a system of coeloms.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of the}} finetooth shark is {{slender and}} streamlined. The snout <b>is</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> pointed, with the nares preceded by short, broadly {{triangular}} flaps of skin. The eyes are large and round, with nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). The mouth is broad with well-defined furrows at the corners. Twelve to 15 tooth rows occur {{on either side of}} the upper jaw and 1314 tooth rows {{on either side of the}} lower jaw. Each tooth is small and needle-like, with a narrow central cusp and smooth to minutely serrated edges. The five pairs of gill slits are long, measuring about half the length of the dorsal fin base.|$|E

5|$|The {{fin whale}}'s body <b>is</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> slender, {{coloured}} brownish-grey with a paler underside. The fin whale {{is a large}} baleen whale that belongs to the Cetacean order, which includes all species of whale, dolphin and porpoise. At least two recognized subspecies exist, in the North Atlantic and the Southern Hemisphere. It is found in all the major oceans, from polar to tropical waters. It is absent only from waters close to the ice pack at the poles and relatively small areas of water away from the open ocean. The highest population density occurs in temperate and cool waters. Its food consists of small schooling fish, squid, and crustaceans including copepods and krill.|$|E
5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the front}} part of the palate) are short and do not reach between the first molars; they are longer in H.alfaroi. The bony palate <b>is</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> extends beyond {{the end of the}} molar row and the back margin of the maxillary bones. The posterolateral palatal pits, which perforate the palate near the third molars, are small, and {{may or may not be}} recessed into a fossa. The sphenopalatine vacuities (openings in the roof of the mesopterygoid fossa, behind the palate) are also small, as are the auditory bullae. As in most oryzomyines, the subsquamosal fenestra, an opening at the back of the skull, is present. The pattern of grooves and foramina (openings) in the skull indicates that the circulation of the arteries of the head in T.talamancae follows the primitive pattern, as in most similar species but unlike in Hylaeamys.|$|E
5|$|The m1 <b>is</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> narrow. The anteroconid, {{the cusp}} {{at the front}} of the tooth, is {{oriented}} perpendicularly to the main axis of the tooth and on the lingual (inner) side is separated from the metaconid cusp. The protoconid, another cusp on the labial (outer) side, is connected at its back to a longitudinal crest, which in turn anchors the transverse mesolophid crest, and then joins the hypoconid labial cusp. In front of the hypoconid, an ectostylid (a smaller cuspule) is present. The entoconid cusp, located lingually, is relatively high and is separated from the mesolophid before it by a deep valley. Another crest, the posterolophid, is present behind the hypoconid. At the front of the m2, crests known as the anterolophid and anterolabial cingulum are present before the protoconid and the metaconid. As on the m1, a transverse mesolophid and an ectostylid are present. The hypoconid and the entoconid are present, as is the posterolophid behind them. Within the posterolophid, there is a small valley that is absent in N.rufus. Both m1 and m2 have two roots; m3 is unknown.|$|E
