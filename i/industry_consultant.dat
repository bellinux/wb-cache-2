500|$|Because of the {{potentially}} humorous nature of aptronyms {{a number of}} newspapers have collected them. San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen reported irregularly on reader-submitted gems, including substitute teacher Mr. Fillin, piano teacher Patience Scales, and the Vatican's spokesman on the evils of rock 'n roll, Cardinal Rapsong. Similarly, the journalist Bob Levey on occasion listed examples sent in by readers of his column in The Washington Post: a food <b>industry</b> <b>consultant</b> named Faith Popcorn, a lieutenant called Sergeant, and a tax accountant called Shelby Goldgrab. Dutch newspaper Het Parool had an irregularly featured column called [...] "Nomen est omen" [...] with Dutch examples. Individual name collectors have also published books of aptronyms.

500|$|Card Collector Services graded {{the card}} and officially ruled that it was indeed a reprint. Cobb and Edwards {{dismissed}} the findings and went to Integrated Paper Services (IPS), an independent paper testing and analysis lab, in February 2003 to have their card's paper tested. An IPS expert determined that the card dated back to 1910, which would be consistent to the time period when the card was distributed. The expert ruled that the [...] "paper stock {{was consistent with the}} time that card would have been made." [...] Cobbs and Edwards later went to an Ohio paper <b>industry</b> <b>consultant</b> who confirmed that the card was from 1909. The consultant stated that a decent counterfeit of the card could only be produced from a [...] "master pressman with 5–10 years experience, and would require a machine which would cost between $500,000 and $2 million." [...] Afterwards, an appraiser named Bob Connelly valued the card at $850,000, based on the two previous paper analysis reports. In November 2005, Cobb and Edwards put the card up for sale on eBay. They had to shut down the sale, however, because Connelly only agreed to appraise the card if his report was printed in its entirety at the eBay card listing.|$|E

2500|$|The CAW {{negotiated}} a cost-cutting deal with General Motors Canada on March 8, 2009. The deal would extend the current contract {{for an additional}} year to September 2012, and preserves the current average assembly-worker base pay of about $34 an hour. It would eliminate a $1,700 annual [...] "special bonus," [...] and reduce special paid absences or [...] "SPA days" [...] from two weeks to one week a year, while maintaining vacation entitlements which range up to six weeks a year for high-seniority workers. The deal also introduce payments by members toward their health benefits - $30 monthly per family for workers and $15 a month for pensioners. Lewenza said it also would trim by 35 per cent company contributions to union-provided programs such as child care and wellness programs. Lewenza called the package a [...] "major sacrifice." [...] However, observers noted that the deal did not go far enough; Dominion Bond Rating Service analyst Kam Hon described it as [...] "not material." [...] Automotive <b>industry</b> <b>consultant</b> Dennis DesRosiers said that General Motors had missed the chance to slash labour costs, pointing out that bankruptcy was a looming threat, Ottawa and Queen's Park demanded cuts to the labour bill {{as a condition of}} the bailout, and that the deficit to the pension fund would prevent the CAW from striking. He estimated the total hourly cost of a GM Canada worker, including benefits, is $75 to $78, and saying that [...] "they [...] got six or seven." [...] when it should have been cut by $20. DesRosiers also said giving up cost-of-living increases is not significant when inflation is nearly non-existent and added that the 40-hour reduction in paid time off merely means [...] "five fewer spa days." [...] University of Toronto professor Joe D'Cruz calculated that it would save $148 million a year, though GM is seeking $6 billion in Canadian government support.|$|E
