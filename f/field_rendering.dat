25|$|The Quadrangular tournament had {{its origins}} in an annual match played between the European members of the Bombay Gymkhana and the Parsis of the Zoroastrian Cricket Club. The first such game was played in 1877, when the Bombay Gymkhana {{accepted}} {{a request for a}} two-day match from the Parsis. The game was played in good spirit, with the Parsis surprising the Europeans by taking a first innings lead. The Gymkhana recovered, but the match was drawn with the sides evenly poised. The challenge was played again in 1878 and looked set to become an annual event, but racial discontent intervened. From 1879 to 1883, the Parsis and Hindus of Bombay were locked in a struggle against the governing Europeans over the use of the playing fields known as the Bombay Maidan. Gymkhana members would play polo on the <b>field,</b> <b>rendering</b> much of it useless for cricket because of the large divots left by the horses, while sparing their own European-only cricket ground. With this dispute settled in favour of the natives, the Europeans versus Parsis matches resumed in 1884.|$|E

In ten minutes they were fully a mile within the <b>field,</b> <b>rendering</b> all attempts {{to get out of it}} to windward so hopeless as to be almost desperate. The manoeuvre of Daggett was begun under circumstances that scarcely admitted of any alternative, though it might be questioned if it were not the best expedient that offered. Now that the schooners were so far within the field-ice, the water was much less broken, though the undulations of the restless ocean were still considerable, and the grinding of ice occasioned by them was really terrific. So loud was the noise produced by these constant and violent collisions, indeed, that the roaring of the wind was barely audible, and that only at intervals. The sound was rushing, like that of an incessant avalanche, attended by cracking noises that resembled the rending of a glacier.|$|E

An audio object manipulation device (3) varies a start point/end point of an audio object within a time period or an actual position of a virtual source within a local span, by the rendering device, depending on {{the situation of the}} wave field synthesis system. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) a method of controlling a wave <b>field</b> synthesis <b>rendering</b> device arranged in a wave field synthesis system (2) a computer program with a program code for executing a method of controlling a wave <b>field</b> synthesis <b>rendering</b> device arranged in a wave field synthesis system. USE - Used in entertainment electronics such as multimedia systems, for controlling a wave <b>field</b> synthesis <b>rendering</b> device arranged in a wave field synthesis system, where the rendering device is designed to produce synthesis signals from audio object comprising an audio file for a number of loudspeakers within a loudspeaker array. ADVANTAGE - The audio object manipulation device varies a start point/end point of an audio object within a time period or an actual position of a virtual source within a local span, by the rendering device, depending on the extent of utilization situation of the wave field synthesis system, thereby avoiding capacity constraint on the transmission lines or in the rendering device. The control device hence reduces the quality break-down of the wave field synthesis system and enables the wave field synthesis system to achieve a high flexibility of application at the same time.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{comparison}} of fair exchange and secure multiparty computation. Despite their apparent similarity, these two problems arise respectively from the fields of distributed systems and of modern cryptography. The wide differences of description and approach in these research <b>fields</b> <b>render</b> hazardous a straightforward comparison of the various results and solutions. By introducing a common specification framework for the two problems, we examine the differences regarding their generality and properties, which then leads us to specify a new problem, named the generalized fair computation. This third problem helps understanding the relations between secure multiparty computation and fair exchange, by bridging the gap between them. We conclude with a discussion on the possible origins of the confusion surrounding certain results. ...|$|R

5000|$|When Great American Ball Park {{opened in}} 2003, it {{featured}} a contemporary-looking, glass-wrapped facade.

Five years later, Nationals Park built off Cincinnati's design, making yet more liberal use of glass along with white concrete that would not clash with architecture in the District.
