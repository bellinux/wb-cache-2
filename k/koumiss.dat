40|$|Introduction. <b>Koumiss</b> is a low-alcohol {{product made}} from {{fermented}} mare's milk, which is popular in Kazakhstan, Russia, {{and other countries}} of Central Asia, China, and Mongolia. Natural mare's milk is fermented in symbiosis of two types of microorganisms (lactobacteria and yeast). Koumiss’s microbial composition varies depending on the geographical, climatic, and cultural conditions. Based on a phenotypic characteristic from samples, Wu, R. and colleagues identified the following bacteria isolated in inner Mongolia, an autonomous region of China: L. casei, L. helveticus, L. plantarum, L. coryniformis subsp. coryniformis, L. paracasei, L. kefiranofaciens, L. curvatus, L. fermentum, and W. kandleri. Studies of the yeast composition in <b>koumiss</b> also showed significant variations. Thus, there were Saccharomyces unisporus related 48. 3 % of isolates, to Kluyveromyces marxianus (27. 6 %), Pichia membranaefaciens (15. 0 %), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (9. 2 %) from 87 isolated yeast cultures. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the bacterial composition in <b>koumiss.</b> Methods. To extract DNA, 1. 8 ml of fermented milk was centrifuged to generate a pellet, which was suspended in 450 µl of lysis buffer P 1 from the Powerfood Microbial DNA Isolation kit (MoBio Laboratories Inc, USA). Amplification of the microflora was used to determine the composition of a fragment of the gene 16 S rRNA and ITS 1. Plasmid library with target insertion was obtained on the basis of height copy plasmid vectors producing high pGem-T. The definition of direct nucleotide sequencing was performed by the method of Sanger using a set of "BigDye Terminanor v 3. 1 Cycle sequencing Kit with automatic genetic analyzer ABI 3730 xl  (Applied Biosystems, USA).  Informax Vector NTI Suite 9, Sequence Scanner v 1. 0  software package used for the analysis.

In the ripe control cheese, without the addition of probiotic strain L. casei Zhang, the number of Lactobacillus reached 5. 7 · 107 CFU/g. Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR (ERIC-PCR) analysis was used to distinguish the added L. casei Zhang from the natural flora of the cheese and to determine whether L. casei Zhang grew in the cheese.

Park has assembled a group of internationally reputed scientists in the forefront of functional milk and dairy products, food science and technology as contributors to this unique book. Coverage for each of the various dairy species includes: bioactive proteins and peptides; bioactive lipid components; oligosaccharides; growth factors; and other minor bioactive compounds, such as minerals, vitamins, hormones and nucleotides, etc. Bioactive components are discussed for manufactured dairy products, such as caseins, caseinates, and cheeses; yogurt products; <b>koumiss</b> and kefir; and whey prod-ucts. Aimed at food scientists, food technologists, dairy manufacturers, nutritionists, nutraceutical and func...|$|E
