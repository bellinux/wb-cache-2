500|$|For his {{performance}} in the game, Navy quarterback Ira McKee was named the Most Valuable Player. Navy led in nearly every statistical aspect of the contest. Washington returned to the Rose Bowl {{at the end of}} the 1925 season, falling to the Alabama Crimson Tide 2019. Navy did not participate <b>in</b> <b>another</b> <b>bowl</b> game until 1955, when their squad, nicknamed the [...] "team named desire", upset the Ole Miss Rebels in the Sugar Bowl. Since the 1924 Rose Bowl, Navy and Washington have met five more times; the Huskies won three of the games.|$|E
500|$|As {{a sophomore}} in 1973, Bell saw his first action against Iowa. [...] He was given five carries and gained 50yards (including a 24-yard gain) for a ten-yard per carry average. [...] Bell {{did not start}} any games in 1973, but his playing time {{increased}} later in the season, including 19carries against Minnesota for 73yards and 15carries against Indiana for 89yards. [...] For the season, Bell rushed for 464yards in 88carries. [...] The 1973 team finished {{with a record of}} 10–0–1, with the only imperfection coming {{at the end of the}} season with a 10–10 tie with Ohio State. [...] Despite tying for the Big Ten Conference championship, Big Ten athletic directors decided to send Ohio State to the Rose Bowl, and conference rules did not permit Michigan to play <b>in</b> <b>another</b> <b>bowl</b> game.

500|$|Washington went 811 in the 1924 season, {{remaining}} {{under the}} direction of coach Enoch Bagshaw. The team was invited to the 1926 Rose Bowl after completing an undefeated 1101 1925 season. They lost the game to the Alabama Crimson Tide by a score of 2019. Washington finished the 1920s with an overall record of 65266; Bagshaw coached the team for every season except 1920, when they were under the leadership of Stub Allison. Navy finished the 1924 season with a 26 record, ending their number of consecutive winning seasons at eight. The Navy football team was not invited to participate <b>in</b> <b>another</b> <b>bowl</b> game until 1955, when the [...] "team named desire", so named due to coach Eddie Erdelatz comparing the squad to the play A Streetcar Named Desire, defeated the Ole Miss Rebels in the Sugar Bowl 210.

Navy and Washington have since met five times, with Washington currently leading the series 321.|$|E

500|$|Unfortunately for Nehlen, the 1993 {{season was}} his final season with double-digit {{victories}} as his subsequent Mountaineer teams failed to recapture {{that level of}} success. [...] After posting a 7–6 record in 1994 and a 5–6 mark in 1995, the 1996 Mountaineers showed promise of returning the program to national prominence. [...] West Virginia began the 1996 season with a 7–0 record, only to lose three of its final four regular season games en route to an 8–3 record and a 20–13 defeat in the Gator Bowl {{at the hands of}} No. 12 North Carolina to finish 8–4. The Mountaineers put together another strong start in 1997, taking a 7–2 record into the final two weeks of the season. [...] Once again, the Mountaineers faltered as they lost 21–14 at Notre Dame and 41–38 in triple overtime to a 5–5 Pitt team to finish the regular season at 7–4. [...] The late season collapse culminated <b>in</b> <b>another</b> <b>bowl</b> game defeat, this time to Georgia Tech in the Carquest Bowl. Despite the disappointing conclusion to the season, quarterback Marc Bulger emerged as a capable leader throwing for 2,465 yards and 14 touchdowns. Running back Amos Zereoué shattered Robert Walker's rushing record with 1,589 yards, and his 18 rushing touchdowns are the second most in a single season at WVU.|$|E

2500|$|To {{address these}} problems, five conferences, six bowl games, and leading {{independent}} Notre Dame {{joined forces to}} create the Bowl Coalition, which was intended to force a de facto [...] "national championship game" [...] between the top two teams.

This system was in place from the 1992 season through the 1994 season.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of four different types of mental practice (free imagery, directed visual, directed reading, and directed audio) {{on the performance of}} 45 beginning and 40 intermediate college bowlers. The groups bowled six games with two sets of five minutes of mental practice prior to the first frame and the sixth frame of each game. Data were analyzed by a two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures. No significant differences existed between treatment groups at either the beginning or intermediate levels. Conclusions were that no one technique of mental practice was more effective than <b>another</b> <b>in</b> increasing <b>bowling</b> performance...|$|R
5000|$|Like NCAA sports where {{a tournament}} determines an {{automatic}} conference bid to the postseason tournament, a team can {{finish with a}} losing record (or a winning record but not eligible because of FCS wins) and still appear in a <b>bowl</b> game. <b>In</b> <b>another</b> change to <b>bowl</b> eligibility rules that took effect in 2010-11, a team that wins its conference but has an overall losing record must receive an NCAA waiver to appear in a bowl game. Previously, the waiver required no NCAA action. The new rule is still largely consistent with the NCAA rules in all other team sports, where {{a team that has}} a losing record that wins their conference championship through the conference tournament earns the automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.|$|R

50|$|Although many recipes require eggs {{to be at}} room temperature, it is {{easiest to}} {{separate}} eggs that are cold.

In this method eggs {{should not be allowed to}} sit too long because of the risk of bacteria growth. An alternate solution is to bring the bowl of egg whites (or yolks) up to temperature by placing it <b>in</b> <b>another</b> <b>bowl</b> of hot water.|$|E

50|$|The series between Notre Dame and USC {{was created}} {{because of the}} still-existing desire for Notre Dame to travel to Los Angeles to please its alums and earn a large payout, {{as well as the}} still-standing {{invitation}} to play them from Coach Henderson. While the creation of the series was contradictory to Notre Dame's efforts to follow the Big Ten in combating commercialism (the Big Ten had a 26-year Bowl ban, which Notre Dame followed even longer), Rockne and other administrators justified the game since it was created as a home-and-home series, only to be played in Los Angeles every other year. The creation of the series was also likely influenced by the hiring of Howard Jones, who knew Rockne from coaching against him at Iowa. To the priests who ran Notre Dame, playing USC in Los Angeles every other year was preferable to making further trips to the Rose Bowl game. Notre Dame would not play <b>in</b> <b>another</b> <b>bowl</b> game until the 1970 Cotton Bowl.|$|E
