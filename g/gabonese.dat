5|$|Born into a Fang family, Aubame was {{orphaned}} {{at a young}} age. He {{was raised}} by the stepbrother of Léon M'ba, who became Aubame's chief political rival. Encouraged by his colleagues, Aubame entered politics, serving as Gabon's first representative in the National Assembly of France from 1946 to 1958. Aubame was also a leader in solving African problems, particularly developing the <b>Gabonese</b> standard of living and planning urban sites. Aubame's quick rise in <b>Gabonese</b> politics was spurred by {{the support of the}} missions and administration, whereas much of M'ba's strength came from the colonists.|$|E
5|$|No {{blood was}} shed during the event, {{and when the}} <b>Gabonese</b> people did not respond violently the {{military}} interpreted this {{as a sign of}} approval. Aubame was offered the presidency of the newly formed provisional government. The government was composed of civilian politicians from both the UDSG and BDG, such as Gondjout. During the coup, he served as Minister of State. The coup's leaders were content at restoring security for the civilians. The small <b>Gabonese</b> army did not intervene; composed mostly of French officers, they remained in their barracks.|$|E
5|$|Following the bombing, French <b>Gabonese</b> {{made more}} {{threatening}} {{phone calls to}} the embassy. A second bomb exploded at the embassy two nights later, causing no damage. A drive-by shooting, during which at least five rounds of buckshot were fired from a 12-gauge automatic shotgun, riddled the second story windows with over 30 holes. It is likely that its perpetrators were French, as <b>Gabonese</b> {{have no access to}} grenades. Following the second bombing a car containing white men was noticed, driving through otherwise empty Shore Boulevard. At the time, practically the only white men in Gabon were French.|$|E
5|$|During these events, no gunshots were fired. The {{people did}} not react strongly, which {{according}} to the military, {{was a sign of}} approval. A provisional government was formed, and the presidency was offered to Aubame. The government was composed of civilian politicians from both the UDSG and BDG, such as Paul Gondjout. As for the coup plotters, they were content to ensure security for civilians. The small <b>Gabonese</b> army did not intervene in the coup; composed mostly of French officers, they remained in their barracks.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>Gabonese</b> mistakenly {{identified}} the United States as a co-conspirator in the coup. Time asserted that French officials helped spread the rumor of American involvement. This {{reached a point}} which some automobile stations refused to help Darlington and other Americans. After William F. Courtney, deputy chief of the United States Embassy, {{received a call from}} a man identifying himself as DuPont and threatening an imminent attack, a hand grenade exploded outside the embassy. The explosion, which occurred {{at a time when the}} building was closed and locked on 3 March, resulted in damage to the embassy sign and the cracking of two windows.|$|E
5|$|Intent on {{propagating}} Islam, in 1973 Gaddafi {{founded the}} Islamic Call Society, which had opened 132 centres across Africa within a decade. In 1973 he converted <b>Gabonese</b> President Omar Bongo, an action which he repeated {{three years later}} with Jean-Bédel Bokassa, president of the Central African Republic. Between 1973 and 1979, Libya provided $500 million in aid to African countries, namely to Zaire and Uganda, and founded joint-venture companies throughout the country to aid trade and development. Gaddafi was also keen on reducing Israeli influence within Africa, using financial incentives to successfully convince eight African states to break off diplomatic relations with Israel in 1973. A strong relationship was also established between Gaddafi's Libya and Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's Pakistani government, with the two countries exchanging nuclear research and military assistance; this relationship ended after Bhutto was deposed by Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in 1977.|$|E

The Vilis of Libreville, which were few and well identified in the indigenous and <b>Gabonese</b> ethnic strains, were, however, were not disturbed.|$|E
25|$|On 19 July, {{opposition}} leader Pierre Mamboundouwho placed {{second in the}} 1998 presidential elections and the 2005 presidential electionswas designated as the candidate of the Alliance for Change and Restoration coalition. Aside from Mamboundou's own party, the Union of the <b>Gabonese</b> People (UPG), this coalition included the National Alliance of Builders (ANB), the Union for the New Republic (UPRN), the National Rally of Woodcutters (RNB), and the <b>Gabonese</b> Socialist Party (PSG).|$|E

25|$|During the African Union {{summit in}} Libreville on 10 January 2005, <b>Gabonese</b> {{president}} Omar Bongo Ondimba proposed {{the creation of}} an African organization of urgent humanitarian intervention in the event of natural disaster or conflict.|$|E
25|$|El Hadj Omar Bongo Ondimba (born Albert-Bernard Bongo; 30 December 1935 – 8 June 2009) was a <b>Gabonese</b> {{politician}} who was President of Gabon for 42 years from 1967 {{until his death}} in 2009.|$|E
25|$|In {{the other}} direction, China's growing thirst for raw {{materials}} led Chinese state-owned enterprises {{to the country}} with natural resources, such as wood and minerals (like those from the <b>Gabonese</b> forests). By {{the end of the}} 1990s, China had become interested in African oil, too.|$|E
25|$|Although {{much of the}} {{protected}} area is unspoiled with human intervention, logging of <b>Gabonese</b> redwood trees has increased considerably in recent years where roads have been built {{and there are two}} logging concessions in the area which could threaten the park in the future. Other threats to the park include low scale gold mining and hunting for crocodile skin, ivory or meat to sell in the cities of Gabon although this is relatively low. Hunting management is being implemented by a protocol signed within Gabon, between the <b>Gabonese</b> Ministry of Forestry Economy, the Governorate of the Woleu-Ntem Province, Bordamur and the villages in which are directly involved. The protocol acknowledges the interests of conservationists, loggers and local communities on matters relating to hunting and fishing. There is also a management strategy towards hunting activities in the north-eastern periphery of the park between the Ministry of Forestry Economy, the Ministry of Mines, and local representatives.|$|E
25|$|On 7 August, violent demonstrations shook Libreville as protesters {{demanded that}} Bongo {{resign from the}} government; <b>Gabonese</b> {{authorities}} had previously banned the march, in which about 10,000 protesters reportedly participated. Protesters threw stones at police and police used tear gas against the protesters. Many presidential candidates were reportedly present at the march: Mamboundou, Mba Abessole, Myboto, Bourdes-Ogouliguende, Oyé Mba, Bengono Asi, Ayo Assayi, and Bruno Ben Moubamba.|$|E
25|$|His French friends {{constantly}} surrounded him, protecting or providing {{him with}} counsel. A presidential guard {{was created by}} Bob Maloubier, a former French secret agent, and co-financed by French oil groups. The oil groups, active in the country since 1957, had strengthened their interests in 1962 after the discovery of offshore oil deposits. Gabon quickly became a major oil supplier for France. They carried such influence in Gabon that following the February 1964 coup, the decision to seek military intervention {{was taken by the}} CEO of Union Générale des Pétroles (UGP; now known as Elf Aquitaine), Pierre Guillaumat, Foccart, and other French businessmen and leaders. Later on, another UGP executive, Guy Ponsaillé, was appointed as political adviser to the president and became M'ba's representative in discussions with French companies. However, the <b>Gabonese</b> president was afraid of internal strife or assassination, so he remained secluded inside his heavily defended presidential palace. Ponsaillé helped M'ba obtain support from political moderates and accompanied him in his visits around the country in order to restore his reputation among the <b>Gabonese</b> people.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, {{he began}} working at UNESCO in its Sector for External Relations and Cooperation as an {{international}} civil servant. In 1978, he became advisor to the <b>Gabonese</b> embassy in France, and he subsequently became Gabon's Permanent Delegate to UNESCO, in which position he served until 1984. He became Director of the Civil Cabinet of the President of Gabon, Omar Bongo, in 1984, serving in that position until 1990.|$|E
25|$|On 28 November 1967, {{just days}} after he took his presidential oath at the <b>Gabonese</b> embassy, M'ba {{died of cancer in}} Paris, where he had been treated since August of that year. He was survived by his wife, Pauline M'ba, and 11 children. The day after M'ba's death, Bongo constitutionally succeeded him as President of Gabon. Gabon's main airport, the Leon M'ba International Airport, was later named for him.|$|E
25|$|He {{left the}} CMG {{to join the}} <b>Gabonese</b> Democratic Bloc (BDG) led by Paul Gondjout in 1954, whom M'ba {{intended}} to overthrow. Gondjout, {{the secretary of the}} BDG, appointed M'ba secretary-general and formed a long term alliance against Aubame. In the legislative elections of 2 January 1956, M'ba received 36% of the votes versus 47% for Aubame. Though not elected, M'ba became the leader of the indigenous territory, and some of the UDSG began to ally themselves with him.|$|E

25|$|On {{the second}} day of competition, Campbell-Brown placed herself in {{contention}} for a medal with a 7.07second run in the first semi-final, although Jones-Ferrette's time in the second semi was faster still. Brooks ran a personal best to beat Jeter in the last semi-final of the day. Among the other qualifiers, Zang Milama surprised further with 7.13-second national record to become the first <b>Gabonese</b> athlete to reach an indoor final in any event. Barber and reigning European 60m champion Yevgeniya Polyakova were among the casualties of the round.|$|E
25|$|Minkébé National Park is a {{national}} park in the extreme northeast of Gabon. It covers an area of 7,570km2. The WWF recognized it as an area needing protection as early as 1989 and has been actively working towards protecting the forest since 1997. The park was established as a provisional reserve in 2000 but the Minkébé National Park itself was officially recognized and established by the <b>Gabonese</b> government in August 2002. It is recognized as a critical site for conservation by the IUCN and has been proposed as a World Heritage Site.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 23 {{candidates}} were approved {{to contest the}} elections, although six of them withdrew immediately before election day, reducing the field to 17 candidates. Despite {{the large number of}} candidates, three of them were considered the key contenders for the Presidency; Ali Bongo Ondimba, the son of Omar Bongo, who was the candidate of the long-ruling <b>Gabonese</b> Democratic Party (PDG); Pierre Mamboundou, a radical opposition leader who was backed by a coalition of parties; and André Mba Obame, a former PDG member who ran as an independent and won the backing of several other candidates.|$|E
25|$|The Vili of Gabon {{are mainly}} located in Mayumba. This locality, {{which has about}} 5000 souls, is the last <b>Gabonese</b> city before {{accessing}} the neighbouring Congo border. The region of Mayumba {{is known for its}} still unspoiled wilderness, its immense beaches that stretch out of sight, beaten by violent waves and violent currents.This wild side is highlighted by the Mayumba National Park, which covers about 870 square kilometers. It is the protected sanctuary where a wide spectrum of animal and plant species flourishes. They include crocodiles, chimpanzees, gorillas, various monkeys, leopards, elephants, antelopes, buffaloes. It is also a great place to observe different species of birds.|$|E
25|$|Bongo {{headed the}} single-party regime of the <b>Gabonese</b> Democratic Party (PDG) until 1990, when, faced with public pressure, {{he was forced}} to {{introduce}} multi-party politics into Gabon. His political survival despite intense opposition to his rule in the early 1990s seemed to stem once again from consolidating power by bringing most of the major opposition leaders at the time to his side. The 1993 presidential election was extremely controversial but ended with his re-election then and the subsequent elections of 1998 and 2005. His respective parliamentary majorities increased and the opposition becoming more subdued with each succeeding election. After Cuban President Fidel Castro stepped down in February 2008, Bongo became the world's longest-serving non-monarch ruler. He was one of the longest serving rulers in history.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, M'ba {{returned}} to Gabon, {{where he was}} greeted exultantly by his friends. He was not reinstated as chef de canton; instead, he obtained an important position as store manager for the English trading house John Holt. That same year, he founded the <b>Gabonese</b> Mixed Committee (CMG), a political party close to the African Democratic Rally (RDA), an inter-African party led by Félix Houphouët-Boigny. The party's main objective was to obtain autonomy for its member states and oppose the Senegalese leader Léopold Sédar Senghor's idea of federalism. Playing on his past as a former exile, and through the network of Bwiti followers, M'ba managed to rally support from the Fang and Myènè peoples. His goal was to win indigenous administrative and judicial posts.|$|E
25|$|On 7 December 1945, after {{a second}} round, Jean-Félix Tchicaya was elected member of the Assembly, before Jean-Hilaire Aubame, Jacques Opangault, Issembé and François-Moussa Simon respectively. Being born in Libreville, the place of {{emigration}} of his father, the tailor Makosso Tchicaya allowed the winner to take over his competitors including the <b>Gabonese</b> candidates. In addition {{to the fact that}} he worked in Gabon and developed strong friendships, he received the votes of the Vili and Lumbu of the Ngounie, and of the Ogooué-Maritime. However, the rivalry between the Middle Congo and Gabon, as well as between the Vili and the Mpongwe, the first two ethnicities of the two countries to have been in contact with Western civilization will lead to separation into two separate constituencies.|$|E
25|$|Since TICAD V, Japan has {{actively}} deployed its diplomacy toward Africa {{in order to}} maintain the momentum and to steadily implement its pledges. For example, the Japan–African Regional Economic Communities (RECs) Summit Roundtable was held in New York on the margins of the UN General Assembly on September 26, 2013, chaired by Prime Minister Abe. In the roundtable, participants exchanged views on agricultural development and food security. In addition, from November 24 to December 5, 2013, Japan dispatched a Public and Private Sector Joint Mission for Promoting Trade and Investment for Africa to the Republic of the Congo, the <b>Gabonese</b> Republic, and Côte d'Ivoire. Thus, Japan hopes to further develop its relations with Africa through such follow-up measures to TICAD V. Furthermore, Prime Minister Abe visited three African countries in January 2014, fulfilling his promise at TICAD V to visit Africa in the near future.|$|E
25|$|Amidst {{this tension}} and controversy, the seven {{excluded}} candidates, {{along with the}} originally accepted candidates Kolingba and Goumba, called for the mediation of <b>Gabonese</b> president Omar Bongo. On January 22, the matter was effectively resolved through the signing by Bozizé and his rivals of an agreement in Libreville, which allowed all the candidates except Patassé to participate and brought {{the total number of}} candidates to 11. According to the agreement, Patassé would remain barred because he was the subject of judicial proceedings. The date of the election was also delayed to March 13, and it was agreed that the constitutional court would not be dissolved, but that it would lose powers regarding the election, which would instead go to CEMI. Subsequently, although Patassé rejected the agreement—saying that he had not authorized Luc Apollinaire Dondon, the first vice-president of the MLPC, to sign it—the MLPC announced on January 26 that it would support the candidacy of Ziguélé, who had previously been running as an independent.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{a curfew}} {{imposed by the}} government, {{violence}} and looting continued in Port-Gentil {{in the days after}} the announcement of results. By 5 September, two people were reported killed there and Total evacuated most of its foreign employees to Libreville. Also on 5 September, Bongo attended a Cameroon–Gabon football match at the Omar Bongo Stadium in Libreville and then spoke to Radio France Internationale, stressing the importance of calm and saying that his opponents should pursue legal avenues if they had complaints. Meanwhile, Mba Obame and Myboto emerged from hiding to attend an opposition meeting, although Mamboundou did not. According to Mamboundou ally Louis-Gaston Mayila, Mamboundou suffered an arm injury at a demonstration in Libreville, during which the police fired tear gas, and then went into hiding. Communications Minister Gondjout said that Mamboundou was unharmed, however. Although protesters burned cars and set up barricades in Libreville, security forces were in clear control of the streets by the end of the day. Additional violence was reported in Nkembo, located east of Libreville. Meanwhile, <b>Gabonese</b> students in Dakar set fire to Gabon's embassy in Senegal.|$|E
500|$|Paul Marie Indjendjet Gondjout (4 June 1912– 1 July 1990) was a <b>Gabonese</b> {{politician}} and civil servant, {{and the father}} of Laure Gondjout, another prominent <b>Gabonese</b> politician. Gondjout {{was a member of the}} Mpongwe ethnic group, and served in the French colonial administration from 1928, and founded the Cercle amical et mutualiste des évolués de Port-Gentil in 1943. [...] He was a delegate to the French Senate from 1949 to 1958, and founded the <b>Gabonese</b> Democratic Bloc (BDG). In 1954, Léon M'ba joined the party and eventually overthrew Gondjout as leader.|$|E
500|$|In August 1953 Gondjout's PDG {{merged with}} the <b>Gabonese</b> Mixed Committee to form the <b>Gabonese</b> Democratic Bloc (BDG). Over {{the course of the}} {{following}} seven years, the party published a newspaper which caught the eye of the aspiring politician Léon M'ba, whom Gondjout had earlier helped to elect to the <b>Gabonese</b> council of government. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902133400/http://www.acdis.uiuc.edu/Research/Ops/Pederson/html/contents/sect5.html |archivedate=September 2, 2007 }}. The two formed an alliance supported by the Mpongwe business community, the wealthy coastal Fangs (like M'ba), and the French, which managed to overpower Jean-Hilaire Aubame and fellow members of the <b>Gabonese</b> Democratic and Social Union. Gondjout, the self-appointed secretary of the BDG, decreed M'ba to be the secretary-general. He and M'ba both believed that Gabon should not have full political independence, stating shortly before it was obtained: ...|$|E
500|$|The 1964 Gabon coup d'état {{was staged}} between 17 and 18 February 1964 by <b>Gabonese</b> {{military}} officers who rose against <b>Gabonese</b> President Léon M'ba. Before the coup, Gabon {{was seen as}} one of the most politically stable countries in Africa. The coup resulted from M'ba's dissolution of the <b>Gabonese</b> legislature on 21 January 1964, and during a takeover with few casualties 150 coup plotters arrested M'ba and a number of his government officials. [...] Through Radio Libreville, they asked the people of Gabon to remain calm and assured them that the country's pro-France foreign policy would remain unchanged. A provisional government was formed, and the coup's leaders installed Deputy Jean-Hilaire Aubame, who was M'ba's primary political opponent and had been uninvolved in the coup, as president. Meanwhile, M'ba was sent to Lambaréné, [...] from Libreville. There was no major uprising or reaction by the <b>Gabonese</b> people when they received word of the coup, which the military interpreted as a sign of approval.|$|E
500|$|He {{continued}} to develop local <b>Gabonese</b> politics, in particular revitalizing the Fang clans. In fact, M'ba asserted that Aubame was too {{involved with the}} Fang {{to pay attention to}} the interests of the southern tribes, a charge Aubame ridiculed. Aubame was also a leader in solving African problems, particularly developing the <b>Gabonese</b> standard of living and planning urban sites. On 29 September 1951, he voted to increase the minimum wage in the overseas territories of France, and served as vice president of its Commission from 1953 to 1955. He organized the <b>Gabonese</b> Democratic and Social Union (UDSG) in 1947, whose leadership came mostly from the interior, particularly Woleu-Ntem Province. The party in turn backed Aubame's reelection in 1951 and 1956. It had few philosophical differences with the M'ba-led Bloc Démocratique Gabonais (BDG), including advocating less economic dependence on France and faster [...] "Africanization" [...] of French political jobs. Fairly quickly, <b>Gabonese</b> politics became dominated by Aubame, supported by the missions and the administration, and M'ba, supported by the settlers.|$|E
