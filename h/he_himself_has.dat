25|$|Stanley Hauerwas {{was raised}} in Pleasant Grove, Texas, in a working-class family. He {{attended}} both Pleasant Grove High School (1954–56) and W. W. Samuell High School (1956–58). As {{the son of a}} bricklayer, Hauerwas was early on apprenticed to the craft of bricklaying under his father. The experience was extremely formative for his later life, as <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> <b>has</b> often compared the skill and hard work that bricklaying requires with both his own approach to theological work and the challenges of living a fully Christian life.|$|E

25|$|The Roman general Messala and {{his troops}} {{have come to}} track down the British king Arvire and bring him captive to the Emperor Claudius in Rome. Princes Irvin and Vellinus enter and tell the Romans their search is in vain: in his hiding place on Mona, Arvire can never be caught. Messala replies that Arvire might be taken by cunning and asks the princes to help him: their mother, Queen Élfrida, has already become an ally of Rome. Vellinus agrees to betray Arvire, {{although}} Irvin is outraged at his brother's behaviour. The brothers leave as the Druids arrive to perform their sacred ritual. Modred, the Chief Druid, says they must do all they can to protect Arvire from the Romans. Arvire enters, accompanied by his daughter Évélina. Arvire is in despair: after his defeat in battle, the Romans captured his wife. Some of the Druids bring in Irvin and Vellinus, whom they have found lurking nearby. Vellinus says they have come with news from their mother, the Queen of Lenox, who now wants to aid Arvire against the Romans. They must bring Arvire back with them to lead the army. Vellinus even claims that <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> <b>has</b> fought the Romans and freed Arvire's wife. Arvire is delighted and eagerly leaves with Vellinus.|$|E
500|$|Bill Szymczyk's has {{frequently}} been noted as {{the sort of}} producer who pushes bands to expand their musical horizons; he has been brought in with the specific intent of changing a band's sound. <b>He</b> <b>himself</b> <b>has</b> credited this tendency to his lack of musical knowledge, stating: [...] "I'm a professional listener. I listen and I react. I never was a musician, so I don't bring any preconceived prejudices to the table; I don't favour the guitar over the keyboard, and so forth. I just listen {{and try to figure}} out if I have anything I can bring to a song." ...|$|E
500|$|The wraith-blade {{attached}} to Raziel's arm, over-aroused after {{the deaths of}} the Sarafan, suddenly seizes control of the physical Reaver, and impales Raziel; Raziel, horrified, then realizes his destiny. <b>He</b> <b>himself</b> <b>has</b> always been the ravenous spirit inside the Reaver, and therefore is fated to be stuck in a time loop; the sword shattered against him in Soul Reaver because it was unable to consume itself. While his soul is being drawn into the sword, Kain emerges and tears the Reaver from Raziel's body, saving him in reciprocation and forcing history to reshuffle again. However, this paradox strains Nosgoth's history too far, enabling the Hylden to return and jeopardize his ambition to restore the Pillars. Amidst Kain's dismay, Raziel realizes that the wraith-blade is still bound to him, and laments that his destiny has not been changed, but merely [...]|$|E

500|$|Mr. Pound has shaken {{the dust}} of London from his feet with not too {{emphatic}} a gesture of disgust, but, at least, without gratitude to this country.... has been an exhilarating influence for culture in England; he has left his mark upon {{more than one of}} the arts, upon literature, music, poetry and sculpture, and quite a number of men and movements owe their initiation to his self-sacrificing stimulus... With all this, however, Mr. Pound, like so many others who have striven for advancement of intelligence and culture in England, has made more enemies than friends... Much of the Press has been deliberately closed by cabal to him; his books have for some time been ignored or written down; and <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> <b>has</b> been compelled to live on much less than would support a navvy. His fate, as I have said, is not unusual... Taken by and large, England hates men of culture until they are dead.|$|E
