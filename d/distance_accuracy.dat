In theory, FMCW radar {{has very}} high <b>distance</b> {{measuring}} <b>accuracy.</b> While in practical system, {{the accuracy of}} FMCW radar is decreased due to the firm frequency sampling interval caused by using FFT to do signal processing. To solve this problem, basing on traditional FFT processing, this paper takes advantage of Chirp-Z transformation to partially detailing the main-lobe of echo wave distance frequency spectrum.

40|$|Our {{previous}} {{analyses of}} the redshifts and distances of galaxies included 55 spiral galaxies and 36 Type Ia Supernovae galaxies in three separate groups. All groups showed evidence that their radial velocities contain the same discrete velocity components that are predicted from the early work of Tifft. Here we examine another new source sample containing 83 ScI galaxies. When B-band distances are used, we find clear evidence that the discrete velocities defined by Tifft’s most common velocity period {{are present in the}} radial velocities of these galaxies. Assuming this is true, we are then able to use the visibility, or ease of detection, of the discrete components as an indication of the <b>distance</b> <b>accuracy</b> of the galaxies, comparing B- and I-band distances, galaxy inclination ranges, and galaxy rotation velocity ranges. We find (a), that, contrary to expectation, B-band distances for these sources are considerably more accurate than I-band, (b), that the <b>distance</b> <b>accuracy</b> varies with galaxy inclination, as expected, with the most consistent distances obtained for inclinations between 48 and 65 degrees, and (c), that distances are probably more accurate for small rotation velocities.

40|$|In this thesis, a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) {{guidance}} {{scheme is}} discussed {{to improve the}} miss <b>distance</b> <b>accuracy</b> and the finite time stability problem in the Proportional Navigation Guidance (PNG). The primary goal {{of this study is}} to design the PID guidance that can accurately intercept the fast maneuvering target. The PID guidance is the extended version of the PNG with the integral and derivative terms in parallel. For the understanding of the conventional PNG model, the two-dimensional (2 -D) engagement model of the missile and target is analyzed. Two characteristics are found in the PNG model: (1) its? stability is kept in the finite time but becomes unstable at the vicinity of the interception and (2) the Line-of-sight angle rate (LOSR) increases as the target acceleration magnitude increases. To regulate the LOSR, the PID guidance is derived based on the servomechanism theory. The PID guidance model replaces the proportional gain of the conventional PNG model by the PID controller. A PID controller design using the numerical method through the iterative simulation is presented. For the various missile and target initial geometries, the capture region of the PID guidance is evaluated and compared with the conventional PNG model. In the end, the PID guidance model shows the improved miss <b>distance</b> <b>accuracy,</b> the extended stable time, and extended capture region when compared with the PNG model...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} years the number of {{ultrasound}} (US) scanners utilized for medical diagnosis rapidly increased. As a consequence, specific methods {{for the evaluation of}} the quality of the US images have been developed, with the aim of verifying the performances of these high-technology apparatuses. However, most of the proposed methods seem to depend on the subjective evaluation of US images, produced by means of test objects (US phantoms), performed by expert operators. Among the examined performances, <b>distance</b> <b>accuracy</b> was usually evaluated on the screen of the US scanner by means of (a) the adjustment of the device settings and (b) the use of the electronic caliper implemented in the scanner, both directly set by the operator. Moreover, also the method for <b>distance</b> <b>accuracy</b> evaluation is not standardized and, therefore, the result is definitely dependent on the adopted procedure. The aim of the present study is the development of a novel method for the automatic evaluation of accuracy in distance measurement performed by medical US scanners. The proposed set-up adopts common US test phantoms as a reference and allows the evaluation of accuracy in vertical and horizontal distance measurements by a least squares estimation on the results of the analysis of the uncompressed bi-dimensional US images directly produced by the scanner.

The hypothesis of this study was that there is a relationship between <b>distance</b> and <b>accuracy</b> and the rotational kinematics of place kicking performance of rugby players in the field setting. Twelve first-team university rugby players had their full body kinematics measured for five place kicks. Kick <b>distance</b> and <b>accuracy</b> were directly measured. The current study showed a positive correlation between torso (r=. 76) and pelvis (r=. 66) rotation with kick distance. Place kick distance (r=. 24) or accuracy (r=. 54) were not correlated to playing experience. Negative correlations between stance elbow flexion (r=-. 78), torso rotation (r=-. 74) and X-factor (r=-. 79) with kick accuracy were noted. Place kick distance could potentially be maximized by improving torso and pelvic rotations. Place kick accuracy could be improved by full extension of the stance arm.
