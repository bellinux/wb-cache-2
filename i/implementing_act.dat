40|$|The {{relative}} {{power of}} the Commission, the Parliament and the Council in the adoption of delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts,</b> including {{the debate on the}} delimitation of the scope of these acts, has dominated the debate on the scheme of non-legislative acts introduced by the Lisbon Treaty. This chapter argues that approaching decision-making procedures of delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts</b> only from an institutional lens is normatively insufficient, in two respects. First, it is incongruous with the Treaty provisions on democracy: not only an inter-institutional perspective is insufficient to ensure the democratic legitimacy of delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts,</b> but also it ignores the relationships between the makers of legal acts and the outer sphere composed of citizens and legally affected persons. Secondly, it also overlooks core functions of procedures that are relevant to ensure the legitimacy of public acts. Procedures are a means to rationalise public action, by channeling information, weighing competing interests, and allowing scrutiny of the choices made. If designed accordingly, procedures could concretise democracy as a Union founding principle also in the making of delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{reform of}} non-legislative acts {{introduced}} by Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union {{was guided by}} concerns regarding the democratic legitimacy of (lato sensu) <b>implementing</b> <b>acts</b> of the Union. However, it has ignored the centrality of transparency in the Union's democracy {{and the role of}} participation as a complementary source of democracy. This article argues that the procedures leading to the adoption of delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts</b> are subject to the treaties' provisions on transparency and participation, and should be shaped by them. It analyses the constitutional choices underlying Articles 290 and 291, with a view to assessing whether and to what extent the material, organic and functional profiles of delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts</b> condition procedural rules on transparency and participation to be followed in their adoption...|$|R

40|$|The {{procedures}} {{guiding the}} making of delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts</b> have been conceived from a predominantly inter-institutional perspective and have not taken account of the participative democracy dimension. The system for delegation of powers set out in Articles 290 and 291 TFEU does not envisage, let alone structure, the relationships between decision-makers and the ‘outer’ sphere: those legally affected by the legal acts of the Union and the public. This dimension should not be ignored in the current constitutional framework, given that Articles 9, 10 (3), and 11 TEU establish normative parameters that should shape {{the relationships between the}} institutions and citizens, and in {{the making of}} delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts.</b> Therefore, since Articles 290 and 291 TFEU do not exhaust the constitutional framing of delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts,</b> the EU legislature should provide a remedy by adopting procedural rules aimed at securing participation and transparency within the process...|$|R

40|$|The non-representative {{character}} of the Commission’s powers {{has been used to}} level criticism at Commission acts. I review the Commission’s power to adopt {{some of the most important}} and numerous EU acts, namely delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts.</b> These acts often take direct effect on the persons within the Member States. The question I ask is how the Commission’s power to adopt acts that legally bind the persons within the Member States can be justified normatively? I explain the most pervasive characteristics of the adoption of delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts,</b> as well as their conceptual categorisation. I argue that delegated and implementing rule-making should be understood in the framework of institutional trust. The relation of institutional trust can in legal terms best be depicted under the framework of fiduciary law. The Commission here takes the role of fiduciary to the persons subject to delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts</b> as beneficiaries. As a result, the Commission is under a duty of loyalty towards these persons. I argue that for this, the EU duty of loyalty should be expanded to include a Commission duty of disinterestedness and fairness. These should be operationalised through giving an account of its motives, and through greater transparency regarding the participation of interested groups in the adoption procedure. These procedures are only a small extension of already existing Commission obligations. However, reforming them as an expression of loyalty is able to re-invent the relation between the Commission and the persons subject to its acts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{development}} of antimalarial drug resistance {{has led to}} increasing calls for the introduction of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). However, little evidence {{is available on the}} full costs associated with changing national malaria treatment policy. This paper presents findings on the actual drug and non-drug costs associated with deploying ACT in one district in Tanzania, and uses these data to estimate the nationwide costs of implementation in a setting where identification of malaria cases is primarily dependant on clinical diagnosis. Methods Detailed data were collected over a three year period on the financial costs of providing ACT in Rufiji District as part of a large scale effectiveness evaluation, including costs of drugs, distribution, training, treatment guidelines and other information, education and communication (IEC) materials and publicity. The district-level costs were scaled up to estimate the costs of nationwide implementation, using four scenarios to extrapolate variable costs. Results The total district costs of <b>implementing</b> <b>ACT</b> over the three year period were slightly over one million USD, with drug purchases accounting for 72. 8 % of this total. The composite (best) estimate of nationwide costs for {{the first three years of}} ACT implementation was 48. 3 million USD (1. 29 USD per capita), which varied between 21 and 67. 1 million USD in the sensitivity analysis (2003 USD). In all estimates drug costs constituted the majority of total costs. However, non-drug costs such as IEC materials, drug distribution, communication, and health worker training were also substantial, accounting for 31. 4 % of overall ACT implementation costs in the best estimate scenario. Annual implementation costs are equivalent to 9. 5 % of Tanzania's recurrent health sector budget, and 28. 7 % of annual expenditure on medical supplies, implying a 6 -fold increase in the national budget for malaria treatment. Conclusion The costs of <b>implementing</b> <b>ACT</b> are substantial. Although drug purchases constituted a majority of total costs, non-drug costs were also considerable. It is clear that substantial external resources will be required to facilitate and sustain effective ACT delivery across Tanzania and other malaria-endemic countries. </p...|$|E

The Directive on Services is a significant legal EU act aimed at removing barriers to the freedom of establishment for providers in Member States and obstacles to the free movement of services between Member States and providing guarantee of the legal certainty necessary for the exercise in practice of two fundamental freedoms of the internal market in practice to recipients and providers. Chapter One offers a basic overview of two fundamental freedoms of the internal market - the freedom of establishment and free movement of services, deals with the necessity of adoption of a new EU regulation and describes the process of adoption of the Directive on Services. Chapter Two explains selected provisions of the Directive. Chapter Three deals with the implementation of the Directive into the Czech legal order and describes relevant Czech implementing legislation. The chapter consists of four parts. Part One focuses on preparation of the <b>implementing</b> <b>Act</b> on Free Movement of Services and Part Two illustrates the adopted Act on Free Movement of Services.
