40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the main kinetic features of biomass pyrolysis, devolatilization, and the <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> <b>reactions</b> of the released species. Three complex steps are faced in sequence: {{the characterization of}} biomasses, {{the description of the}} release of the species, and finally, their chemical evolution in the <b>gas</b> <b>phase.</b> Biomass is characterized as a mixture of reference constituents: cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. This assumption is verified versus experimental data, mainly relating to thermal degradation of different biomasses. Devolatilization of biomasses is a complex process in which several chemical reactions take place in both the gas and the condensed phase alongside the mass and thermal resistances involved in the pyrolysis process. A novel characterization of the released species is applied in the proposed devolatilization models. The successive <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> <b>reactions</b> of released species are included into an existing detailed kinetic scheme of pyrolysis and oxidation of hydrocarbon fuels. Comparisons with experimental measurements in a drop tube reactor confirm the high potentials of the proposed modeling approach...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{document}} the potential impact on indoor air quality of outdoor ozone during photochemical pollution episodes. A preliminary one-day experiment was conducted during summer 2002 in a room of the CSTB experimental house MARIA. Ozone, VOC and aldehyde concentrations were monitored outdoors and indoors from 8 a. m. to 8 p. m. Outdoor ozone hourly mean concentrations increased from 30 to 100 µg/m 3 during the day. The indoor to outdoor ratio ranged from 0. 10 to 0. 25, indicating possible ozone-induced reactions occurring indoors. α-Pinene concentrations decreased from 30 to 15 µg/m 3 suggesting indoor <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> <b>reactions.</b> At the same time, formaldehyde concentrations increased from 70 to 100 µg/m 3.
