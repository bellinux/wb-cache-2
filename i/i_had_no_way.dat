60|$|I {{leave it}} to any man to judge what {{difficulties}} presented to my view. I was away from my native country, at a distance prodigious, and the return to me unpassable.

If I had discovered myself to my mother, it might be difficult to convince her of the particulars, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to prove them. On the other hand, if she had questioned or doubted me, I had been undone, for the bare suggestion would have immediately separated me from my husband, without gaining my mother or him, {{who would have been}} neither a husband nor a brother; so that between the surprise on one hand, and the uncertainty on the other, I had been sure to be undone.|$|E
60|$|I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in {{representing}} to {{myself in the}} most lively colours, how I must have acted, if I had got {{nothing out of the}} ship; how I could not have so much as got any food, except fish and turtles; and that, as it was long before I found any of them, I must have perished first: that I should have lived, if I had not perished, like a mere savage: that if I had killed a goat or a fowl by any contrivance, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to flay or open them, or part the flesh from the skin and the bowels, or to cut it up; but must gnaw it with my teeth, and pull it with my claws, like a beast.|$|E

I picks out to myself all sorts of favourites from the bill of fare, and imagines them coming. I guess it's that way with all hungry men. They can't get their cogitations trained on anything but something to eat. It shows that the little table with the broken-legged caster and the imitation Worcester sauce and the napkin covering up the coffee stains is the paramount issue, after all, instead of the question of immortality or peace between nations.|$|E

60|$|In {{this time}} I found much employment, (and very {{suitable}} {{also to the}} time) for I found great occasion of many things which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to furnish myself with, but by hard labour and constant application; particularly, I tried many ways to make myself a basket; but all the twigs I could get for the purpose proved so brittle, {{that they would do}} nothing. It proved of excellent advantage to me now, that when I was a boy I used to take great delight in standing at a basket-maker's in the town where my father lived, to see them make their wicker-ware; and being, as boys usually are, very officious to help, and a great observer of the manner how they worked those things, and sometimes lent an hand, I had by this means so full knowledge of the methods of it, that I wanted nothing but the materials; when it came into my mind, that the twigs of that tree from whence I cut my stakes that grew, might possibly be as tough as the sallows, and willows, and osiers, in England; and I resolved to try.|$|E
60|$|The {{greatest}} inconvenience {{the hunters}} caused {{me was the}} delay, for they have a nasty habit of keeping one treed {{for an hour or}} more if balked in their designs; but at last we came in sight of a line of cliffs running east and west across our path {{as far as the eye}} could see in either direction, and I knew that we reached the natural boundary which marks the line between the Kro-lu and Galu countries. The southern face of these cliffs loomed high and forbidding, rising to an altitude of some two hundred feet, sheer and precipitous, without a break that the eye could perceive. How I was to find a crossing I could not guess. Whether to search to the east toward the still loftier barrier-cliffs fronting upon the ocean, or westward in the direction of the inland sea was a question which baffled me. Were there many passes or only one? <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of knowing. I could but trust to chance. It never occurred to me that Nobs had made the crossing at least once, possibly a greater number of times, and that he might lead me to the pass; and so it was with no idea of assistance that I appealed to him as a man alone with a dumb brute so often does.|$|E
60|$|I had now to {{consider}} {{which way to}} steer my course next, {{and what to do}} with the estate that Providence had thus put into my hands; and, indeed, I had more care upon my head now than I had in my state of life in the island where I wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing but what I wanted; whereas I had now a great charge upon me, and my business was how to secure it. I had not a cave now to hide my money in, or a place where it might lie without lock or key, till it grew mouldy and tarnished before anybody would meddle with it; on the contrary, I knew not where to put it, or whom to trust with it. My old patron, the captain, indeed, was honest, and that was the only refuge I had. In the next place, my interest in the Brazils seemed to summon me thither; but now I could not tell how to think of going thither till I had settled my affairs, and left my effects in some safe hands behind me. At first I thought of my old friend the widow, who I knew was honest, and would be just to me; but then she was in years, and but poor, and, for aught I knew, might be in debt: so that, in a word, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> but to go back to England myself and take my effects with me.|$|E
60|$|If that {{explanation}} of how the Jews of Prussia came to be renamed is correct, {{if it is true}} that they fictitiously registered themselves to gain certain advantages, it may possible be true that in America they refrain from registered themselves as Jews to fend off the damaging prejudices of the Christian customer. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of knowing whether this notion is well founded or not. There may be other and better ways of explaining why only that poor little 250,000 of our Jews got into the 'Encyclopaedia'. I may, of course, be mistaken, but I am strongly of the opinion that we have an immense Jewish population in America.|$|R

5000|$|On 30 September 1986, the KGB {{proposed}} to expel Orlov from the Soviet Union after depriving {{him of his}} Soviet citizenship and met with approval from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Orlov’s release from exile and expulsion from the USSR lifted hopes among Westerners that the Helsinki process might finally start yielding progress.

6000|$|So I thanked him, but {{told him}} the thing couldn't be worked in that way, and I said {{it over and over}} again, until, at last, he {{believed}} it. Then he offered to lend me the money necessary, but this offer I had to decline, too. As <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of paying it back, I might as well have taken it as a gift. There wasn't anything he could offer, after this, except to get me a free pass; and as he had no way of doing that, he gave up the job, and we all went down to supper. That evening, as I was putting a few things into a small valise which I had bought,--as our trunks were lost on the [...] "Tigris," [...] I had very little trouble in packing up,--I said to Rectus that by the time he started off he could lay in a new stock of clothes. I had made out our accounts, and had his money ready to hand over to him, but I knew that his father had arranged for him to draw on a Savannah bank, both for the tug-boat money and for money for himself. I think that Mr. Colbert would have authorized me to do this drawing, if Rectus had not taken the matter into his own hands when he telegraphed. But it didn't matter, and there wasn't any tug-boat money to pay, any way, for Uncle Chipperton paid that. He said it had all been done for his daughter, and he put his foot down hard, and wouldn't let Rectus hand over a cent.|$|E
60|$|My next {{concern was}} to get a stone mortar to stamp or beat some corn in; for as to the mill, there was no thought of {{arriving}} to that perfection of art with one pair of hands. To supply this want I was at a great loss; for, of all trades in the world, I was as perfectly unqualified for a stonecutter, as for any whatever; neither had I any tools {{to go about it}} with. I spent many a day to find out a great stone big enough to cut hollow, and make fit for a mortar; but could find none at all, except what was in the solid rock, and which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to dig or cut out: nor, indeed, were the rocks in the island of sufficient hardness, as they were all of a sandy crumbling stone, which would neither bear the weight of a heavy pestle, nor would break the corn without filling it with sand: so, after {{a great deal of time}} lost in searching for a stone, I gave it over, and resolved to look out a great block of hard wood, which I found indeed much easier; and getting one as big as I had strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed it on the outside with my axe and hatchet; and then, with the help of fire, and infinite labour, made a hollow place in it, as the Indians in Brazil make their canoes. After this, I made a great heavy pestle, or beater, of the wood called iron-wood; and this I prepared and laid by against I had my next crop of corn, when I proposed to myself to grind, or rather pound, my corn into meal, to make my bread.|$|E

60|$|The rainy seasons held {{sometimes}} {{longer and}} sometimes shorter, as the winds happened to blow; {{but this was}} the general observation I made. After I had found, by experience, the ill consequences of being abroad in the rain, I took care to furnish myself with provisions beforehand, that I might not be obliged to go out: and I sat within doors as much as possible during the wet months. In this time I found much employment, and very suitable also to the time; for I found great occasion for many things which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to furnish myself with, but by hard labour and constant application: particularly, I tried many ways to make myself a basket: but all the twigs I could get for the purpose proved so brittle, that they would do nothing.

These I set up to dry within my circle or hedge; and when they were fit for use, I carried them to my cave: and here, during the next season, I employed myself in making, as well as I could, several baskets; both to carry earth, or to carry or lay up any thing as I had occasion for. Though I did not finish them very handsomely, yet I made them sufficiently serviceable for my purpose: and thus, afterwards, I took care never to be without them; and as my wicker-ware decayed, I made more; especially strong deep baskets, to place my corn in, instead of sacks, when I should come to have any quantity of it.|$|E
