5|$|Since {{its design}} {{does not meet}} current <b>highway</b> <b>bridge</b> standards, Pulaski Skyway is {{considered}} functionally obsolete, In 2007, it was rated structurally deficient. The 2007 collapse of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge in Minneapolis raised concerns about {{the stability of the}} skyway, one of eight New Jersey bridges with similar design features. Within days of the collapse, NJDOT announced that it would start a previously planned one-year, $10-million project to make critical repairs. The work was the first phase of a planned 10-year, $200-million interim renovation project, the first significant repairs since 1984.|$|E
5|$|The Darlington's Bridge at Delaware Station was a <b>highway</b> <b>bridge</b> {{over the}} Delaware River in the {{community}} of Delaware, New Jersey (known locally as Delaware Station). Formerly a railroad bridge constructed by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad in 1871 to replace an earlier 1855 timber span, the bridge was sold off when the new one upstream was constructed. Henry V. Darlington, an Episcopal minister in Delaware and nearby Belvidere offered to buy the second-hand bridge for $5,000 (1914 USD, equal to $ today). Darlington converted it into a <b>highway</b> <b>bridge,</b> using two fired members of the nearby Meyer's Ferry to be toll collectors. The bridge prospered, becoming a part of State Highway Route6 in 1927 and U.S. Route46 in 1936. In 1932, during the massive state takeover of bridges by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, Darlington refused offers, bargaining his way up to $275,000 (1932 USD, equal to $ today) before accepting the sale. This amount {{was a far cry from}} the nearby Belvidere-Riverton and Portland-Columbia Covered Bridge, which were accepted for $60,000 (equal to $ today) and $50,000 (equal to $ today) respectively. On that moment, tolls along the bridge and Route6 were eliminated. The bridge prospered toll-free for another 21 years, until the construction of the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge upstream at Columbia. Although Reverend Darlington was still alive to see all this transpire, the Commission ceased operations on the Darlington Bridge on April3, 1954, and the bridge was immediately demolished.|$|E

5|$|The two-story Joseph F. Glidden House is {{constructed}} from locally fired brick, which is relatively soft. The softness of the brick has {{caused it to}} weather in a non-uniform fashion. The brick {{is said to have}} been fired at a small brickyard which once existed on the Kishwaukee River in DeKalb, near the present-day Lincoln <b>Highway</b> <b>bridge.</b> The home stands on a stone foundation and was designed by local carpenter and eventual barbed wire competitor to Glidden, Jacob Haish. Construction was completed in 1861 and the home is a prominent example of Illinois French Colonial architecture.|$|E
5|$|The {{lower and}} middle {{sections}} of the Klamath River are vulnerable to flooding, and major floods have occurred in years where major flooding {{has taken place in}} Northern California, particularly in the wake of Pineapple Express storms that bring large amounts of warm rain to Northern California. Significant floods on the Klamath River have occurred in 1926–1927, 1955, 1964, 1997, and 2005, in several cases changing the course of the river. The Christmas flood of 1964 was particularly devastating, with a high water reaching , inundating the towns of Klamath and Klamath Glen and destroying most of the Highway 101 bridge crossing the river. The <b>highway</b> <b>bridge</b> was rebuilt in a different location, though entrances to the old bridge still stand.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, a new {{railroad}} {{bridge was}} constructed, replacing the old Long Bridge. In 1906, a <b>highway</b> <b>bridge</b> was constructed nearby. Together, these two projects destroyed what little remained of Fort Runyon. The approach routes to the bridges ran directly through the earthworks {{of the old}} fort, and these were leveled {{in order to provide}} smooth passage for trains and automobiles. By 1941, when ground was broken for work on the Pentagon, nothing remained of the fort. Today, Interstate 395 runs through the site of the fort, and Exit 9 from the interstate is at the approximate center of where Fort Runyon stood. A nearby historical marker erected by the Arlington Historical Society commemorates the fort's existence.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Highway</b> <b>bridges</b> {{played an}} {{important}} role in lifeline systems. Their seismic damage status made a direct influence on the implement plan of the earthquake relief work and the life and property security of the people. Therefore, accurate assessment and prediction for the seismic damage of <b>highway</b> <b>bridges</b> were of vital significance, based on which reasonable earthquake fortification could be implemented. This paper summarized and classified the existing seismic damage assessment methods for <b>highway</b> <b>bridges,</b> including certain index evaluation methods based on statistical results, vulnerability index evaluation methods based on probability theory and vulnerability index evaluation methods based on aggregation model. Then the capacity-spectrum method which could be used for calculating the fragility curve and the seismic assessment model of <b>highway</b> <b>bridges</b> used in HAZUS were specially explained. At last, the proposal for the development of seismic assessment systems related with <b>highway</b> <b>bridges</b> in China was put forward. Considering HAZUS’s good performance in seismic assessment, a similar assessment system should be built in China as soon as possible. The first step should be classifying <b>highway</b> <b>bridges</b> in China based on their current situation and obtaining their seismic assessment model parameters roughly, which tend to be safe. The second step should be carrying out sufficient experiments and numerical analysis and revising the model parameters obtained in the first step...|$|R
5|$|The President of the United States of America, {{authorized}} by Title 10, Section 8742, United States Code, takes pleasure in presenting the Air Force Cross to Colonel Robin Olds (AFSN: 0-26046), United States Air Force, for extraordinary heroism in military operations against an opposing armed force {{while serving as}} Strike Mission Commander in the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing, Ubon Royal Thai Air Base, Thailand, against the Paul Doumer Bridge, a major north-south transportation link on Hanoi's Red River in North Vietnam, on 11 August 1967. On that date, Colonel Olds led his strike force of eight F-4C aircraft against a key railroad and <b>highway</b> <b>bridge</b> in North Vietnam. Despite intense, accurately directed fire, multiple surface-to-air missile attacks on his force, and continuous harassment by MiG fighters defending the target, Colonel Olds, with undaunted determination, indomitable courage, and professional skill, led his force through to help destroy this significant bridge. As a result the flow of war materials into this area was appreciably reduced. Through his extraordinary heroism, superb airmanship, and aggressiveness {{in the face of}} hostile forces, Colonel Olds reflected the highest credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.|$|E
5|$|However, the city's levee {{and flood}} walls {{designed}} and built by the US Army Corps of Engineers breached in over fifty locations. Storm surge breached the levees of the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal ("MR-GO") in approximately 20 places and flooded all of Saint Bernard Parish, the east bank of Plaquemines Parish and the historic Lower Ninth Ward. The major levee breaches in the city included breaches at the 17th Street Canal levee, the London Avenue Canal, and the wide, navigable Inner Harbor Navigation Canal, which left approximately 80% of New Orleans flooded. There were three major breaches at the Industrial Canal; one on the upper side near the junction with MR-GO, and two on the lower side along the Lower Ninth Ward, between Florida Avenue and Claiborne Avenue. The 17th Street Canal levee was breached on the lower (New Orleans West End) side inland from the Old Hammond <b>Highway</b> <b>Bridge,</b> and the London Avenue Canal breached in two places, on the upper side just back from Robert E. Lee Boulevard, and on the lower side a block in from the Mirabeau Avenue Bridge. Flooding from the breaches put {{the majority of the}} city under water for days, in many places for weeks. Many roads and buildings were damaged by Hurricane Katrina.|$|E

30|$|Design {{codes and}} {{guidelines}} for static and dynamic analyses of regular bridges are well-established and understood. However, there remains significant uncertainty {{with regard to}} the response characteristics of skew <b>highway</b> <b>bridges</b> as it is reflected by the lack of detailed procedures in the current guidelines. As evidenced by past seismic events (e.g., 1994 Northridge - Gavin Canyon Undercrossing and 1971 San Fernando - Foothill Boulevard Undercrossing), skew <b>highway</b> <b>bridges</b> are particularly vulnerable to severe damage due to earthquakes. Even though {{a number of studies have}} been conducted over the last three decades, research findings have not been sufficiently comprehensive to address the response characteristics of skew <b>highway</b> <b>bridges</b> under static and dynamic loading. Therefore, a large number of <b>highway</b> <b>bridges</b> are still at risk with consequential threat to loss of function, life safety, and economy following a major earthquake.|$|R
30|$|To monitor load {{performance}} of RC <b>highway</b> <b>bridges</b> strengthened with CFRP-structural systems, {{there is a}} growing need for effective field procedures to evaluate the bond structural condition of CFRP plates applied to extensive numbers of <b>highway</b> <b>bridges.</b> The NDT device presented in this paper using the technology of impact-echo testing, with further development, can have direct application to current bridge testing and maintenance programs for owners of CFRP-strengthened bridges. This NDT method can potentially provide bridge engineers a practical procedure to evaluate large areas of CFRP plates applied to multiple <b>highway</b> <b>bridges</b> in a national highway.|$|R

The <b>Highway</b> <b>Bridge</b> was finally removed from the site in 1967, and {{was taken to the}} Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, for bombing practice. In 1972, a third bridge opened immediately downstream of the southbound (Mason) bridge, carrying two express lanes in each direction. These lead directly to the high-occupancy vehicle lanes on Virginia's section of I-395 (though the express lanes on this bridge are not HOV lanes themselves and are available to all traffic).
