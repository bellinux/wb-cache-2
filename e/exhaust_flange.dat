40|$|An inlet {{interface}} flange, inlet diffuser, fuel struts and nozzles, combustor liner, liner {{housing and}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>flange</b> comprise {{a system to}} be installed in an existing test facility. The system was designed for operation at 40 atmospheres inlet pressure, 900 K inlet temperature, and air flow to 80 kg/sec. Six penetrations are provided in the outer pressure housing. Adapters at the penetrations, permit use of various types of radiation instrumentation. Five total radiation radiometers and two heat flux gases were installed. Rotating exhaust instrumentation {{can also be used}} to determine combustor performance. Data are presented showing total radiation at three axial positions of the combustor, and comparison of total radiation with data from a heat flux gage...|$|E
40|$|Currently PM exhaust flanges and HEGO bosses are {{manufactured}} from 409 L or 434 L stainless steel powder by employing high temperature, hydrogen sintering. The high temperature sintering {{is necessary to}} achieve the large shrinkage needed to reach the specified sintered density set forth by OEM. Producers of exhaust components are today sintering between 1290 C to 1390 C to reach desired densities. 410 LV is a newly developed low chromium ferritic stainless steel which exhibits greater sintering activity at lower temperatures compared to the standard 409 L. By selecting this alloy it is feasible to achieve a sintered density of 6. 9 g/cc under mesh-belt sintering conditions (below 1180 C). This permits {{a significant reduction in}} the manufacturing cost and allows possible production of exhaust components without investment in high temperature capability. 410 LV sintered at reduced temperature may offer adequate mechanical strength, corrosion resistance, and weldability for the <b>exhaust</b> <b>flange</b> and HEGO boss applications. This paper treats the properties of low temperature sintered 410 LV, and compares those with the properties of low and high temperature sintered 409 L...|$|E
50|$|At first, Saab used a Garrett {{turbocharger}} (T3), {{which was}} oil-cooled. From 1988 through 1990, water-cooled T3s were fitted. In 1990, Saab fitted Mitsubishi TE-05 turbochargers in the SPG models {{only for the}} USA; for other countries, and for the USA from 1991, all 900 Turbos were fitted with the TE-05. Also water-cooled, the TE-05 was slightly smaller than the Garrett T3s, providing improved throttle response and quicker spool-up. The TE-05 is unique in that its <b>exhaust</b> inlet <b>flange</b> utilizes a Garrett T3 pattern.|$|R
