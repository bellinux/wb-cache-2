5|$|In the mid-1990s, Nordreisa Municipal Council {{attempted}} {{to change the}} airport's name from SÃ¸rkjosen to Nordreisa. They {{argued that it was}} necessary to use the Nordreisa name to market the region as a tourist destination. The application was rejected by the Ministry of Transport and Communications, who stated that airports were required by regulation to be named after a settlement rather than a municipality. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. This required the terminal to be slightly rebuilt; while it previously had a common departure and arrivals hall, it had to be separated into two areas. The municipality therefore decided to transfer the ownership of the ground <b>handling</b> <b>service</b> to the three employees. Avinor carried out a major upgrade to the runway safety area and landing lights in 2008 and 2009. The investments cost NOK40 million. The expansion of the safety area resulted in part of the lot of Birkelund Sawmill being expropriated.|$|E
5|$|Plans for {{the club}} {{to move to a}} new groundMaine Roadin Moss Side were {{announced}} in 1922. The final Manchester City match at Hyde Road was a league fixture against Newcastle United on 28 April 1923, and in August 1923 a public practice game was the last football match played at Hyde Road. Manchester City began the 192324 season at Maine Road, which had an 80,000 capacity. Parts of Hyde Road were used elsewhere; the roof of the Main Stand was sold to Halifax Town, and erected at The Shay, where even in the 21st century, part of the Hyde Road roof is still in place. Within a decade, all traces of the football ground had disappeared from Hyde Road. The bulk of the area was taken over by Manchester Corporation Tramways department, whose major Hyde Road depot and works was alongside, for use as their Permanent Way yard for assembling and storing tramway rails and materials. The Tramways system also provided at this time a substantial parcels <b>handling</b> <b>service</b> within the city, using both vans and special parcels trams, and a new central parcels depot was built on the Bennett Street side of the former site, against the railway viaduct. After the end of Manchester's trams in 1949 (most of the old trams were scrapped on this site) it was used for storing old buses and as a bus drivers' training area. As of 2000, the site of the pitch is Olympic Freight Terminal, a container storage and warehousing facility.|$|E

Temporary measures {{were put in}} place to secure fuel, but by late February the supplier, BP Southern Africa, had applied to the Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal high court for a liquidation order against the airline. The application was heard on Friday 24 February 2012. The liquidation was not granted immediately and the airline was given time to respond to 5 March 2012. Simultaneously its Air Maintenance Organization (AMO), SAA Technical, withdrew their services, allegedly for unpaid maintenance bills.

In this environment aircraft requiring ground <b>handling</b> <b>services</b> and the corresponding service providers are self-interested autonomous parties. Moreover, the environment is well-known for its large number of disturbances. We employ a heterogeneous multiagent scheduling framework with two types of autonomous agents representing aircraft and ground service providers respectively. We use online scheduling to cope with uncertainty in the release time of project: the uncertainty in aircraft arrival time at an airport...|$|R
