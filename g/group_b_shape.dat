Embryos derived from the in vitro fertilization of oocytes with spermatozoa recovered from rats of group A or <b>group</b> <b>B</b> 1 or <b>group</b> <b>B</b> 2 were transferred to female recipients. We induced CRF {{in a group of}} rats (group B; n = 56; the total kidney volume was reduced to one-sixth with two operations).

Nine weeks after the second operation, the fertility of each male rat was assessed by mating tests and in vitro fertilization of oocytes. The mean litter size was significantly smaller in the subpopulation of fertile animals in <b>group</b> <b>B</b> 2 than in the fertile rats of <b>group</b> <b>B</b> 1 and in the fertile rats of <b>group</b> <b>B</b> 1 than in the fertile rats of group A.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} whether {{fresh frozen plasma}} (FFP) transfusion affects outcomes following hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in terms of liver function, postoperative complications and cancer prognosis. METHODS: We retrospectively compared the incidence of postoperative complications between 204 patients who underwent hepatectomy for HCC with routine FFP transfusion in an early period (1983 - 1993, Group A) and 293 with necessity for FFP transfusion during a later period (1998 - 2006, <b>Group</b> <b>B),</b> and also between two subgroups of <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> [22 patients with FFP transfusion (<b>Group</b> <b>B</b> 1) and 275 patients without FFP transfusion (<b>Group</b> <b>B</b> 2) ]. Additionally, only in limited patients in <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> 1 and <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> 2 with intraoperative blood loss ≥ 2000 mL (<b>Group</b> <b>B</b> 1 ≥ 2000 mL and <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> 2 ≥ 2000 mL), postoperative complications, liver function tests, and cancer prognosis were compared. RESULTS: No mortality was registered in <b>Group</b> <b>B,</b> compared to 8 patients (3. 9 %) of Group A. The incidence of morbidity in <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> 2 [23. 2 % (64 / 275) ] was {{not significantly different from}} <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> 1 [40. 9 % (9 / 22) ] and Group A [27. 0 % (55 / 204) ].

40|$|Abstract Background Sox domain {{containing}} {{genes are}} important metazoan transcriptional regulators implicated {{in a wide}} rage of developmental processes. The vertebrate B subgroup contains the Sox 1, Sox 2 and Sox 3 genes that have early functions in neural development. Previous studies show that Drosophila <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> genes have been functionally conserved since they play essential roles in early neural specification and mutations in the Drosophila Dichaete and SoxN genes can be rescued with mammalian Sox genes. Despite their importance, the extent and organisation of the <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> family in Drosophila has not been fully characterised, {{an important step in}} using Drosophila to examine conserved aspects of <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> Sox gene function. Results We have used the directed cDNA sequencing along with the output from the publicly-available genome sequencing projects to examine the structure of <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> Sox domain genes in Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila pseudoobscura, Anopheles gambiae and Apis mellifora. All of the insect genomes contain four genes encoding <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> proteins, two of which are intronless, {{as is the case with}} vertebrate <b>group</b> <b>B</b> genes. As has been previously reported and unusually for <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> genes, two of the insect <b>group</b> <b>B</b> genes, Sox 21 a and Sox 21 b, contain introns within their DNA-binding domains. We find that the highly unusual multi-exon structure of the Sox 21 b gene is common to the insects. In addition, we find that three of the <b>group</b> <b>B</b> Sox genes are organised in a linked cluster in the insect genomes. By in situ hybridisation we show that the pattern of expression of each of the four <b>group</b> <b>B</b> genes during embryogenesis is conserved between D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura. Conclusion The DNA-binding domain sequences and genomic organisation of the <b>group</b> <b>B</b> genes have been conserved over 300 My of evolution since the last common ancestor of the Hymenoptera and the Diptera. Our analysis suggests insects have two <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> 1 genes, SoxN and Dichaete, and two <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> 2 genes. The genomic organisation of Dichaete and another two <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> genes in a cluster, suggests they may be under concerted regulatory control. Our analysis suggests a simple model for the evolution of <b>group</b> <b>B</b> Sox genes in insects that differs from the proposed evolution of vertebrate <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> genes. </p...|$|R

In the current study, we attempted to investigate the differences in optic tracts between normal and unilateral optic nerve transected macaque monkeys using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Four healthy neonatal macaque monkeys were randomly divided into 2 groups, with 2 in each group.

It was postulated that transducing ability is associated with staphylococcal phages of serological <b>group</b> <b>B</b> and with related phages of group F...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Many chronic {{hepatitis}} B (CHB) patients recur after off-therapy {{and have to}} accept prolonged consolidation therapy with NUCs. We investigated the rate of HBV relapse after stopping NUCs therapy with different time period of prolonged consolidation therapy in HBeAg positive CHB patients, and analyzed the associated-factor of recurrence. METHODS: We recruited 162 HBeAg-positive CHB patients who met the standard of stopping NUCs therapy recommended by the 2005 APASL. Patients in group A, without the prolonged consolidation therapy, were as controls. Patients in <b>group</b> <b>B</b> were divided into 3 subgroups (<b>group</b> <b>B</b> 1, 7 (range 3 - 11) months of the prolonged consolidation therapy; <b>group</b> <b>B</b> 2, 17 (range 13 - 20) months of the prolonged consolidation therapy; <b>group</b> <b>B</b> 3, 28 (range 25 - 34) months of the prolonged consolidation therapy). Virologic relapse was defined as an increase in serum HBV DNA to > 10 (3) copies/ml after off-therapy. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-six patients (group A, 40 patients; <b>group</b> <b>B</b> 1, 54 patients; <b>group</b> <b>B</b> 2, 23 patients; <b>group</b> <b>B</b> 3, 19 patients) were eligible for this study. The cumulative rates of relapse in <b>group</b> <b>B</b> at 6 months and 48 months were 29. 2 %, 41. 7 % after off-therapy, respectively. The cumulative rates of relapse in <b>group</b> <b>B</b> were statistically lower than that in group A {{at the same time}} periods. The cumulative rate of relapse in <b>group</b> <b>B</b> 3 or <b>group</b> <b>B</b> 2 was statistically lower than that in <b>group</b> <b>B</b> 1, respectively. On multivariate analysis by Cox's proportional hazard model, age at off-therapy, baseline ALT and the different time period of the prolonged consolidation therapy were associated with the relapse of HBV after off-therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Consolidation therapy with NUCs after HBeAg seroconversion should be further prolonged. Age at off-therapy, ALT at baseline and the time period of the prolonged consolidation therapy could provide information to direct anti-viral therapy...|$|R
