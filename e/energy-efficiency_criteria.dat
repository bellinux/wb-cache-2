To allowing the best connectivity to applications anywhere at any time, many vertical handover decision strategies have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we present an overview of the most representative and recent strategies. We also compare them. Finally, we introduce our context aware vertical handover decision approach based on both quality of service and <b>energy-efficiency</b> <b>criteria...</b>|$|E

This fact has become clear to many organizations concerned with ensuring building performance. What to do about these problems is less clear. Several electric utilities around the U. S. have begun {{to take action to}} address the start-up, control, and operational problems that are found in nearly every building. One of the most beneficial periods to intervene in the building life cycle is during the start-up phase of a now building. Building commissioning during start up is such an intervention. Commissioning can be defined as: a set of procedures, responsibilities, and methods to advance a system from static installation to full working order in accordance with design intent. In broad terms, commissioning can extend from design reviews through operations and maintenance planning and training. With such a broad scope aimed at the entire building life cycle, commissioning is often likened to {open_quotes}Total Quality Management{close_quotes} Yet the heart of commissioning are the procedures developed and executed to ensure that all building systems function as intended. The incorporation of <b>energy-efficiency</b> <b>criteria</b> into building commissioning is a new development...|$|E

We then propose a criterion to objectively balance between the most energy-efficient configuration (where all resources are given to the single most energy efficient device) and the throughput-optimal allocation (where all devices evenly share the resources regardless of their power consumption). We derive a closed-form expression for the optimal configuration of the WLANs {{with respect to the}} <b>energy-efficiency</b> <b>criterion.</b> We validate our analysis through simulations, and show that our approach betters the prevalent allocation schemes discussed in literature in terms of energy efficiency, while maintaining the notion of fairness among competing devices.

We propose a metric of hardware intensity (h), which is useful for evaluating issues that affect both circuits and architecture. Analyzing data for actual de-signs we show how to measure the introduced parameters and dis-cuss variations between observed results and common theoretical assumptions. For a power-efficient design we derive relations for h and supply voltage V under progressively more general situations, and incorporate h into a prior art architectural <b>energy-efficiency</b> <b>criterion.</b> Then, a more general relation is derived for the optimal balance between the architectural complexity, hardware intensity and power supply. Modified forms for these relations are obtained in special cases where the supply voltage is constrained or when clock gating is disallowed...|$|R
