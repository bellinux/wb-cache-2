2500|$|In Campo: Still Entertaining Campese {{reflects}} that, [...] "As chance {{would have}} it, Jonah {{got the ball}} in the opening stages of the second half and ran straight at meâ€¦ I think <b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> but I tackled him. Later in the half he pushed me aside to score a try, but I could at least claim to have cut him down once." [...] Following the Test Campese and Lomu met in the changing rooms and exchanged their jerseys. Lomu gave Campese his number 11 jersey while Campese gave Lomu his number 16 jersey. Campese's 92nd Test marked the last Test he would play in the amateur era.|$|E
60|$|The {{next moment}} Uncle Willoughby {{had opened the}} drawer. <b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|And then {{footsteps}} sounded outside, and {{the hope}} died away. <b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|Haven't I? I suppose <b>I</b> must <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and say nothing. You're in {{love with}} her. D'you think I've not seen it in these months? That's {{why you want to}} leave me.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{had to eat}} two meals, though," [...] said Felicity with a shiver. [...] "And I don't {{know when}} those dishes of hers were washed. <b>I</b> just <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and took gulps." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{in spite}} of that {{discomfort}} I found something reassuring by insensible degrees in the rationality of this business of question and answer. <b>I</b> could <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> think of <b>my</b> answer, and almost forget that the the Grand Lunar has no face....|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Master, I saw and heard, not everything, {{because there}} came {{a point at which}} <b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and stopped my ears, but still much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Shall <b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> {{and hold}} your head?" [...] quavered devoted Betty, {{as they went}} up the stairs so many {{reluctant}} feet had mounted before them.|$|E
60|$|Then I saw the {{man with}} the weapon {{straighten}} himself for the effort. I saw the cold steel gleam on high, and once more <b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|Impossible to {{mistake the}} sound of billiard balls! Impossible to mistake the whir of a ball over the slate! But I was to be excused. Even when <b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> enlightened <b>eyes</b> the sound was marvelously {{like that of a}} fast game.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, yes, Dale, I think I can. I'm {{pretty sure}} of it. That ball comes easily, {{only a little}} longer swing and more snap, and honestly, Dale, I hardly ever think about the plate. I know where it is, and <b>I</b> could <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and throw strikes." ...|$|R
6000|$|LADY WINDERMERE. [Sits on sofa.] Because <b>I,</b> who had <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> to life, {{came to the}} brink. And one who had {{separated}} us - ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and thought. Again the flashes {{seemed to}} stand out clear and distinct. But no detail supervened--no face came back to me. I felt it was useless.|$|E
6000|$|At night I go {{on board}} and say [...] Good-night to all my friends on shore; [...] <b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and sail away [...] And see and hear no more.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I go {{to sleep}} I'll have to shut my eyes," [...] he explained; [...] "and if <b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> they may grow together, and then I'd be blind for life!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{named the}} Lily now: once I had another name. Nada, {{daughter}} of Mopo, I was once; but name and all else are dead, and I go to join them. Kill me {{and make an}} end. <b>I</b> will <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> that <b>I</b> may not see the great axe flash." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all, poy; not at all. It is goot to t'e poty {{to lighten}} t'e soul of its opligations. Ast I see, howsefer, t'at Dus ist trouplet, <b>I</b> wilt <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{and look into}} my own t'oughts a little, for I may not tie for some hours yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I sees it all afore {{me every}} time <b>I</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b> Lordy, sir, you wouldn't hardly believe how clear it is to me. There's our line from the {{paregoric}} bottle right along to the snuff box. D'ye see? Well, then, the pill box is for Hougoumont on the right--where we was--and Norah's thimble for La Haye Sainte. There it is, all right, sir; and here were our guns, and here behind the reserves and the Belgians. Ach, them Belgians!" [...] He spat furiously into the fire. [...] "Then here's the French, where my pipe lies; and over here, where I put my baccy pouch, was the Proosians a-comin' up on our left flank. Jimini, {{but it was a}} glad sight to see the smoke of their guns!" ...|$|R
60|$|So {{that great}} black dog rushed forward and caught my poor father in its big mouth, {{although}} {{he tried to}} drag himself away on his front paws, and after that <b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "He was {{the life}} of the old school," [...] Jimmy said, {{referring}} to me, [...] "and when <b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> I can hear his merry laugh as if we were both in knickerbockers still." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> once {{or twice}} and tried to persuade myself {{that the whole thing}} was a delusion, but every time that I opened them there was the man still {{regarding}} me with the same stony, menacing stare.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't know," [...] {{answered}} Corny. [...] "I {{was leaning}} far over, when my hand must have slipped, {{and the first}} thing I knew I was into it. It's good <b>I</b> didn't <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b> If you get into water, with your eyes shut, you can't open them again." [...] She still puffed a little. [...] "Coming up was the best. It's the first time I ever saw the bottom of a boat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Naughty Primrose," [...] cried Cowslip, a {{child of}} six years old; [...] "I did not fall asleep, and <b>I</b> only <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> so as to see {{a picture of what}} Cousin Eustace was telling about. His stories are good to hear at night, because we can dream about them asleep; and good in the morning, too, because then we can dream about them awake. So I hope he will tell us one this very minute." ...|$|R
60|$|Without {{seeing any}} reason to believe that women are, on the average, so strong physically, intellectually, or morally, as men, <b>I</b> cannot <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> to the fact that many women are much better endowed in all these respects than many men, and I am at a loss to {{understand}} on what grounds of justice or public policy a career which is open to the weakest and most foolish of the male sex should be forcibly closed to women of vigour and capacity.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> for I {{saw the man}} {{coming with}} a spear, and myself, I could not stir to Leo's help, for I was growing weak, {{and the two men}} on me were not yet dead, and a deadly {{sickness}} overcame me.|$|E
60|$|I clung {{with both}} hands till my nails ached, and <b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> as if {{to cover up the}} peril. Gradually my mind came back again, my pulses quieted down to a more natural time, and I was once more in {{possession}} of myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Dick in {{a puzzled}} voice, [...] "I tore {{it all to}} bits. There was a reason, though I can't {{remember}} it. In fact, I can't remember anything to-day. But don't go off if <b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> for a minute: it wouldn't be fair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I must go in {{love and}} charity with all men? I do so. I have not a grudge against any human being. Of course, I know the world too well to be {{satisfied}} with it. <b>I</b> cannot <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> to the fact that millions are living very sinful, shocking lives--extortioners, unjust, adulterers; and that three people out of four are going straight to hell. I pity them, and forgive them any wrong which they have done to me. What more can I do?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{being able}} to {{appreciate}} or conceive {{of the distinction between}} the psychical phenomena of a Chimpanzee, and of a Boschisman or of an Aztec, with arrested brain growth, as being of a nature so essential as to preclude a comparison between them, or as being other than a difference of degree, <b>I</b> cannot <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> to the significance of that all-pervading similitude of structure--every tooth, every bone, strictly homologous--which makes the determination of the difference between 'Homo' and 'Pithecus' the anatomist's difficulty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{know the}} {{expression}} [...] . I've felt it often enough {{on my own}} face. But {{put it out of}} your mind, there's a dear. It will keep till Monday [...] . or if it doesn't so much the better. Oh, girls, girls, see that patch of violets! There's something for memory's picture gallery.

6000|$|... "No, Baas. I was {{watching}} {{at a little}} distance as you bade me do and the sun being hot, <b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> {{to keep out the}} glare of it, so that I did not see them until they had passed me and heard the noise." ...|$|E
60|$|I dropped {{upon the}} thwart again, none too soon, for I was near overboard.

60|$|He eyed me close. The words, as {{he spoke}} them, seemed to call up dimly some faint memory of my pre-natal days--of my First State, as I had learned from the doctors to call it. But his {{scrutiny}} made me shrink. <b>I</b> <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and looked back.|$|E
6000|$|... "At all events," [...] said Oliver, laughing, [...] "I {{have lived}} {{to form a}} better opinion of you than that. But, in {{reference}} to Clearemout, <b>I</b> cannot <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> {{to the fact that}} the work doing at the new mine is very like a sham, for they have only two men and a boy working her, with a captain to superintend; and it is said, for I made inquiries while in London, that thirty thousand pounds have been called up from the shareholders, and there are several highly paid directors, with an office-staff in the City drawing large salaries." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Rachel, Rachel!" [...] he moaned, [...] "why {{will you}} haunt my sleep? Oh! my child, my child, have I not {{suffered}} enough? Must you bring my sin {{back to me}} in this fashion?
