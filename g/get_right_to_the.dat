It's well-worth asking what's brought all this on, and the answer seems to be — if his dinner with Jeanie is any indication — that he's a young doctor in love. Whether he continues his nice-guy routine while he plays second fiddle to Jeanie's husband remains to be seen, but giving Benton a love-interest, no matter how ill-fated, will offer his character some much needed life outside the hospital." [...] As the first season drew to a close in episode 25 [...] "Everything Old is New Again", Benton is shown to be keen for their relationship to progress, asking Jeanie to leave her husband; by contrast Jeanie is reticent and pulls away, leaving the future of their relationship unclear.

5000|$|With Morris Halle and others, Chomsky {{founded the}} {{graduate}} program in linguistics at MIT in 1961. The program immediately attracted {{some of the}} brightest young American linguists. Jerry Fodor and Jerrold Katz, both graduates of the Ph.D. program at Princeton, and Paul Postal, a Ph.D. from Yale, {{were some of the}} first students of this program. They made major contributions to the nascent field of TGG. John Viertel, a colleague of Chomsky at RLE in the 1950s, began working for a Ph.D. dissertation under Chomsky on the linguistic thoughts of Wilhelm von Humboldt, a nineteenth-century German linguist. Viertel's English translations of Humboldt's works influenced Chomsky at this time and made him abandon Saussurian views of linguistics. Chomsky also collaborated with visiting French mathematician Marcel-Paul Schützenberger, and was able to formulate {{one of the most important}} theorems of formal linguistics, the Chomsky-Schützenberger hierarchy. Within the theoretical framework of TGG, G. H. Matthews, Chomsky's colleague at RLE, worked on the grammar of Hidatsa, a Native American language. J. R. Applegate worked on the German noun phrase. Lees and Klima looked into English pronominalization. Matthews and Lees worked on the German verb phrase. On the nature of the linguistic research at MIT in those days, Jerry Fodor recalls that [...] "...communication was very lively, and I guess we shared a general picture of the methodology for doing, not just linguistics, but behavioral science research. We were all more or less nativist, and all more or less mentalist. There was a lot of methodological conversation that one didn't need to have. One could <b>get</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> substantive issues. So, from that point of view, it was extremely exciting.". In 1962, Chomsky gave a paper at the Ninth International Congress of Linguists entitled [...] "The Logical Basis of Linguistic Theory," [...] in which he outlined the transformational generative grammar approach to linguistics. In June 1964, he delivered a series of lectures at the Linguistic Institute of the Linguistic Society of America (these were later published in 1966 as Topics in the Theory of Generative Grammar).|$|E

40|$|To <b>get</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{heart of}} the matter, the Roman ideal of pietas which Virgil’s Aeneas embodies means the {{observance}} of what {{is due to the}} gods and men, and obeying one’s destiny (fatum, fate) or calling. Fatum is associated with the word fari, to speak; thus, destiny is the expressed will of the gods: a vocation, a calling (vocatio, a summons; vocare, to call). In Homer, destiny is the portion allotted each man at birth – the length of his life, blessings, miseries. All things are fixed and determined by Necessity (another idea of Fate or Fortune); the gods decide all things, yet even the gods are subject to Fate. Hence, because of the conditionality of human existence, the individualist Homeric ideal of arêté (personal glory in any agon or contest) and timé (personal honor and esteem among one’s peers). But in Virgil’s Aeneid – where the leitmotif of fatum recurs some 120 times – the gods work through human wills and desires; their interventions are often metaphors for divin...|$|E

But this is a symptom, and not the cause of our “intensifying problems ” and widespread political inadequacy, if not paralysis. Rather, the root cause of our problems is an obsolete, industrial-era structuring for the production and distribution of knowledge. (2) In short, massive infoglut, incoherence, and wasted knowledge. There is, in fact, no shortage of ideas, strategies, agendas, solutions, and new paradigms, as concerns the interrelated problems of employment, security, climate change, pollution, education, poverty, inequality, globalization, scarce resources, aging but growing populations, and the ever-growing proliferation of technologies that alleviate and/or aggravate these problems.
