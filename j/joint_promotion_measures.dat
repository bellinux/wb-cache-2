50|$|Once {{the rules}} were written, they were almost universally {{accepted}} with 95% of promotions in the United Kingdom adopting them. In 1952, {{the rules were}} adopted by the newly formed <b>Joint</b> <b>Promotions,</b> officially {{as a way to}} uphold the committee's ideology but was also considered to be a way for <b>Joint</b> <b>Promotions</b> to effectively control British wrestling.|$|R

50|$|On October 19, 1991, Vampiro would {{team up with}} Villano III {{to defeat}} Dos Caras and El Canek in a CMLL and UWA <b>joint</b> <b>promotion</b> event. In 1991 he would {{continue}} to take part in CMLL and UWA <b>joint</b> <b>promotion</b> events and in 1992 he debuted for Universal Wrestling Association in a single promotion setting. On January 31, 1993, Vampiro defeated El Canek in a two out of three falls match to become the UWA World Heavyweight Champion.

50|$|Finlay's first {{match was}} for his father's {{promotion}} in Glynn in 1974, when he filled {{in for a}} wrestler who no-showed. He began wrestling on a full-time basis in Carrickfergus and throughout Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland {{for the next four}} years before moving to England in 1978. In England, he wrestled for various companies under the <b>Joint</b> <b>Promotions</b> banner. Finlay defeated Alan Kilby on 9 June 1982 to win his first title, the <b>Joint</b> <b>Promotions</b> British Heavy Middleweight Championship. At this time, Finlay's then-wife, Princess Paula became his manager.|$|R
50|$|<b>Joint</b> <b>Promotions</b> was {{represented}} in London by the Dale Martin promotion, which had incorporated in 1948, and involved Les Martin, and Jack, Johnny and Billy Dale, whose real last names were, in fact, Abby not Dale. Other promoters included Norman Morell and Ted Beresford in Yorkshire, Billy Best in Liverpool, Arthur Wright in Manchester and George de Relywyskow in Scotland, with Arthur Green {{the secretary of}} the group. By agreeing to rotate talent and block out rival promoters, <b>Joint</b> <b>Promotions</b> was soon running 40 shows a week, while leaving wrestlers with little bargaining power. The financial advantages of this arrangement helped the members survive the tough conditions caused by a post-war tax that took 25% of all entertainment revenue. Other promoters were not so successful. The closure of Harringay Arena in 1954 was the last straw for Atholl Oakley, and <b>Joint</b> <b>Promotions</b> were the only major player left to benefit when Chancellor Peter Thorneycroft abolished the entertainment tax in the 1957 budget.|$|R
50|$|The {{title was}} founded in 1953 and {{remained}} in <b>Joint</b> <b>Promotions</b> until the mid-1980s when it {{was taken over by}} All Star Wrestling. The title remained active until the mid-1990s.|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{combinations}} of promotions and offers of free samples of a weaning {{food and a}} contraceptive were sent by mail {{to a sample of}} Sri Lankan households with recently born children. Based on responses to an initial mailing and a follow-up, promotions and offers significantly affected behavior, with impact greater for the weaning food than for the contraceptive. No significant gain in response resulted from <b>joint</b> <b>promotions,</b> but cost savings made <b>joint</b> <b>promotion</b> of both products to the same target group cost effective. © 1980 JIBS.

5000|$|In 1979 Arion, {{billed as}} [...] "The Iron Greek", arrived in <b>Joint</b> <b>Promotions</b> {{claiming}} {{a version of}} the Mountevans Rules World Heavyweight championship. He made televised defences of his championship against such opponents as Colin Joynson, Lee Bronson and Romany Riley before losing the title to Wayne Bridges.

50|$|The {{success of}} wrestling on {{television}} did however create a better {{opportunity for the}} independent groups. The opposition to Joint came from the Australian-born promoter, Paul Lincoln. Having promoted shows in the 1950s with himself in the main event as masked heel Doctor Death, Lincoln led a consortium of independent promoters under the British Wrestling Federation (BWF) whose name was used for a rival championship, built around Heavyweight champion Bert Assirati who split away from <b>Joint</b> <b>Promotions</b> in 1958 while still champion. Although <b>Joint</b> <b>Promotions</b> considered the title vacant and held a tournament for a new champion (won by Billy Joyce), Assirati continued to claim it within the BWF.|$|R
50|$|The {{rivalry between}} the two clubs carried on {{throughout}} the 1980s. Following their <b>joint</b> <b>promotion</b> to the First Division in 1979, the teams met {{four times in the}} top flight with Palace failing to record a victory.|$|R
50|$|The {{two states}} also hold regular summit {{meetings}} to discuss bilateral and multilateral agreements and current topics. A major {{issue on the}} bilateral agenda in cultural matters is the <b>joint</b> <b>promotion</b> and diffusion of the Portuguese language.|$|R
50|$|Slater {{made his}} debut for <b>Joint</b> <b>Promotions</b> Wrestling (then known as Maximum Power Wrestling) in May 2003 against fellow debutants Will Power and Daryl Wylde. He would later capture the Lightweight Championship from Bustar on 9 July 2005.|$|R
50|$|It was the {{promoters}} themselves who revolutionized the business {{during this time}} by using America's National Wrestling Alliance territory system {{under the guise of}} an alliance of promoters attempting to regulate the sport and uphold the committee's ideas to, in fact, create a promotional cartel designed to carve up control of the business between a handful of promoters - which it did in 1952 under the name of <b>Joint</b> <b>Promotions.</b> By agreeing to rotate talent, and block out rival promoters, <b>Joint</b> <b>Promotions</b> was soon running 40 shows a week, while leaving wrestlers with little bargaining power. One of Joint Promotions' first moves was establishing (and controlling) the championships. At first, this proved a profitable venture, with title matches leading to raise ticket prices. However, perhaps inevitably, attempts to extend this success by bringing in additional titles led to overexposure. While the World and British titles had some credibility (particularly as they were often placed on the more legitimate wrestlers), the addition of European, Empire/Commonwealth, Scottish, Welsh, and area championships got out of hand, and at one point there were conceivably 70 different titleholders to keep track of within <b>Joint</b> <b>Promotions</b> alone.|$|R
50|$|In 1972, Crabtree {{returned}} to <b>Joint</b> <b>Promotions</b> as a villain with a gimmick of the Battling Guardsman {{based on his}} former service with the Coldstream. It was during this period that {{he made his first}} appearances on World of Sport on ITV.|$|R

50|$|Prior to the {{founding}} of the Discovery Trail, museums worked together informally on <b>joint</b> <b>promotions.</b> In 1999, the Ithaca Discovery Trail was established using a grant to fund a part-time coordinator. It was incorporated in 2007 and gained a Section 501(c)(3) tax exemption in 2008.|$|R
50|$|While {{no further}} <b>joint</b> <b>promotions</b> between AAA and NOAH have {{happened}} since then AAA has sent wrestlers {{to work for}} NOAH in Japan and NOAH has sent wrestlers to work for AAA in Mexico, most notably Takeshi Morishima, Naomichi Marufuji, Ricky Marvin and Kenta.|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} 1980s there was {{increasing}} dissatisfaction among both fans and wrestlers {{with the direction}} of <b>Joint</b> <b>Promotions</b> (which was increasingly centred on Big Daddy), {{which resulted in a}} steady flow of top UK talent into All Star Wrestling (as it was by then renamed) and away from Joint and the TV spotlight. Title-holders such as World Heavyweight Champion Mighty John Quinn, rival claimant Wayne Bridges, British Heavyweight Champion Tony St Clair, World Heavy-Middleweight Champion Mark Rocco, British Heavy-Middleweight Champion Frank 'Chic' Cullen and World Lightweight Champion Johnny Saint all defected to All Star taking their titles with them, as did many non-titleholders. By the mid-1980s All Star was running shows head-to-head with <b>Joint</b> <b>Promotions</b> and had its own TV show on satellite channel Screensport.|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} an attempt to {{understand}} current consumer <b>joint</b> sales <b>promotion</b> in India and thereby identify related prospects and problems. For a conceptual overview, relevant literature in this area was studied. To gain an insight into current practices, announcements of the offers through secondary sources were compiled. A content analysis revealed that "Target market commonality" relationship was the prime reason for companies offering <b>joint</b> sales <b>promotion.</b> It was found that the usage of <b>joint</b> sales <b>promotion</b> was most prevalent in consumer durable category. There exists a prospect for using <b>joint</b> sales <b>promotion</b> in non-durable category. Identifying a suitable partner, planning and co-ordination are the main issues for a manager wanting to use this tool. A guideline regarding the above issues has been suggested. ...|$|R
50|$|Performers became {{dissatisfied}} with their position within the <b>Joint</b> <b>Promotions</b> and soon looked elsewhere for exposure mainly outside the UK as a whole. As a result, there was a rise in New Japan and Calgary's junior-heavyweight divisions, both of which had their roots in British wrestling of the time.|$|R

The title was abandoned {{when the two}} companies split.|$|R
50|$|It was at Alberto-Culver {{where his}} career nearly ended prematurely, {{due to an}} ill-fated <b>joint</b> <b>promotion</b> with the Potato Growers of Idaho that {{involved}} a spurious Universal Product Code. Safka has said that this debacle instilled an obsession with checking details, {{as well as an}} enduring fear of anything with black-and-white parallel stripes.|$|R
