40|$|The {{umbrella}} organization of evaluation in Europe is the <b>European</b> <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Society</b> (EES). Founded in 1994 in Hague (Netherlands), the EES elects presidents for two-year mandates {{and provides a}} central secretariat {{for two to three}} years in different locations. The EES welcomes all individuals interested in evaluation, professionally or academically. Members of the EES receive a Newsletter, 2 a one year subscription to Evaluation: the International Journal of Theory, Research and Practice, and reductions on EES conference fees and other activities. The web site of the EES provides a good overview about the evaluation community including lists of European and international evaluation associations and networks, evaluation journals, events, and other online resources. Currently, the EES provides links to 13 national or multinational European organizations as well as 5 regional networks within the United Kingdom (see Figure 1). A Portuguese evaluation society will be established (News from the Community, 1 This is a first draft of an illustration of evaluation in Europe.

40|$|Realist {{evaluation}} {{is no longer}} the ‘‘next new thing’ ’ in the field. In a little less than 20 years, it has become a popular evaluation approach across the globe, recently drawing a standing room only crowd for a panel entitled ‘‘Is Realist Evaluation Keeping its Promise’ ’ at the <b>European</b> <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Society</b> meetings. In his most recent offering, The Science of Evaluation: A Realist Manifesto, {{one of the founders of}} realist evaluation, Ray Pawson, continues his work developing and promoting realist evaluation. Pawson’s realist manifesto presents a stylized version of the ways realism, a compelling middle ground philosophy of science that lies between positivism and constructivism, can guide the practice of evaluation. Given the popularity of his previous book with Nick Tilley, Realistic Evalua-tion (Pawson & Tilley, 1997), why do we need another book promoting this particular formulation of evaluation rooted in realism? We need this book because it offers a coherent, prescriptive theory of evaluation practice that has developed a cadre of adherents worldwide, and it better explains what this particular strain of realist {{evaluation is}}, and, as importantly, what it is not. In addition, it contains nuggets that evaluators of any stripe could use to trouble their prior work and guide improvements in their future practice. Any practicing evaluator who reads this book with time to listen to the ideas and reflect on their impli...|$|E
40|$|Conference paper {{given at}} the <b>European</b> <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Society</b> Conference: 'Evaluation in Society: Critical Connections', London, October 4 th- 6 th 2006 This paper assesses the {{congruence}} between the initiatives for regulatory reform known as â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 better regulationâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 and the recently re-formulated â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 growth and jobsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 Lisbon agenda of the European Union. To do that, better regulation is re-conceptualised as meta-regulation - sets of rules {{on the process of}} rule-formulation, adoption, implementation, and evaluation. Meta-regulation has both structural and discursive properties. Better regulation discourse has been re-defined over the years. Its malleability has enabled policy-makers to address different objectives and to push for their shifting regulatory reform agendas. This explains how the better regulation pendulum has been able to swing between regulatory quantity (or de-regulation) and quality across time and even across the same country. In terms of structural properties, there is diversity across time and countries on fundamental issues such as the dominant stakeholders and the contents of regulatory impact assessment. â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 Better regulationâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 has been re-defined by the Barroso Commission to fit in with the â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 growth and jobsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 priorities of Lisbon. This re-definition, however, has also narrowed the scope, the range of stakeholders, and the ambitions in terms of governance and regulatory legitimacy. Diversity, proliferation of objectives and better regulation rhetoric make the relationship between meta-regulation, the Lisbon agenda, and, looking at the long-term impact, the dynamics of the regulatory state problematic. The quality-quantity divide and the role played by credibility and regulatory legitimacy are critical for the development of meta-regulation {{and its impact on the}} regulatory state...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the changing role of evaluation for public {{policies and the}} increasing importance of comprehensive evaluation systems for more effective and learning public institutions. In this context, evaluation systems are becoming {{an essential element of}} governance and democratic processes. Within the framework of the current EU Structural Policy and its new challenges (enlargement, new priorities, regional policy paradigm), the creation and the development of evaluation capacities and comprehensive evaluation systems becomes increasingly an instrument for organizational learning and policy improvement. In this context, the development of evaluation systems is not only fundamental for the new member states, but also for countries with a poor evaluation culture or a fragmented evaluation system.

40|$|At {{about the}} same time that <b>European</b> <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Society</b> President Frans Leeuw invited me to keynote this fourth EES conference in Lausanne, my local coffee shop went out of business. It had only been open for two years, having been part of a surge of new coffee shops {{throughout}} the United States as Americans fell in love with cappuccino. This particular coffee shop was quite unique because it was a "biker " shop. That is, it catered to aficionados of large Harley Davidson motorcycles affectionately called "Hawgs. " The owners, Scott and Connie, a young husband and wife team, were also bikers. Because the coffee shop was only a block from my office, I had become a regular, despite lacking the appropriate leather attire and loud steel machine. One morning Connie mentioned that she had decided to try the new laser surgery to correct her near-sighted vision. I left for a trip wishing her a positive outcome from the surgery. When I returned two weeks later the coffee shop was closed and a barely legible handwritten note on the door said: Closed indefinitely [...] vision problem I made inquiries at a nearby petrol station but all I learned was that the shop had closed very suddenly without notice. Some three weeks later I happened to see Scott riding his motorcycle on the street and waved him over to ask how Connie was doing. He said she was fine. What about the sign on the coffee shop door? That {{had nothing to do with}} Connie's surgery, he explained. "I just couldn't vision myself serving coffee the rest of my life. " That got me thinking about the vision for evaluation encompassed in the conference theme "Taking Evaluation to the People: Between Civil Society, Public Management and the Polity. " This seemed to suggest a connection between evaluation and democracy. So I began pondering the question: In what ways might evaluation strengthen and support democracy...|$|E
40|$|Participating in the <b>European</b> <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Society</b> 2012 Conference {{enabled me}} to report on {{educational}} development evaluation projects while obtaining useful feedback from participants. It also {{gave me the opportunity}} to attend several sessions which focused on the latest trends on evaluation methodologies and the use of technology. Collecting evidence for the multiple uses of institutional open software tools in relation to teaching and learning activities will be an ongoing part of my future evaluation projects within my CLDD department. This paper reports on two open source survey tools that were used to gather data related to Athabasca University’s (AU) educational development activities within a qualitative evaluation framework. First, a Moodle questionnaire module was used to assess the educational development needs of faculty. In another instance, Lime Survey served to gather qualitative information for an expert review on the usability of course learning objects from both a technical and pedagogical dimensions. A comparative review of both online tools will be provided from an educational development perspective. It aims to analyze the multiple uses of evaluative instruments {{as part of a broader}} discussion on ‘utilization-focused evaluation’ in the context of Higher Education projects. Open education is an integral part of Athabasca University’s organizational culture as one of the pioneering online and distance teaching universities. Therefore, there is a strong institutional support for open source tools such as Lime Survey and Moodle, which is the university’s learning management system (LMS). The databases and servers for each tool are hosted within different units of the Canadian Open University. This level of technical integration within the institution makes it easier to access and use these open source survey tools as part of the academic practice for both faculty and professionals. Within this institutional context, integrating open source tools to conduct qualitative inquiries on recent educational development initiatives sponsored by AU‘s Centre for Learning Design and Development can be viewed as a strategic alignment towards supporting innovative teaching and learning activities. In fact, one of the rationales for using Moodle to conduct a needs assessment was building on AU faculty’s familiarity with the LMS to raise their awareness about the Moodle questionnaire module. One of the outcomes is to make use of this feature to gather additional qualitative feedback from students to enhance course design and development. Similarly, the expert review conducted through Lime Survey provided an opportunity for faculty and professionals to test the tool as well as responding to the object of the qualitative inquiry focused on improving future course learning objects design. Although both qualitative evaluation projects were different in terms of objective and scope, one of the reasons for using these Web-based open source survey tools stem from an institutional commitment to accessibility, flexibility and, ease of use. This factor could have an incidence on participants’ responses and emerging findings from both online qualitative inquiries. At this exploratory stage of the comparative review, it is anticipated that Moodle and Lime Survey will be embedded as part of AU systematic research-based responses to appropriately identify and address educational development needs and challenges...|$|E

40|$|Background : Over the years, Communities of Practice {{have gained}} {{popularity}} as a capacity-building method among Monitoring and Evaluation practitioners. Yet, thus far, relatively little is known about their effectiveness. Objectives : This {{article focuses on}} National <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Societies</b> as Communities of Practice that aim {{to contribute to the}} monitoring and evaluation capacity building of their members. Method : Drawing upon a survey of 35 National <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Societies</b> in 33 low- and middle-income countries, we explore to what extent capacity building efforts have been successful and what factors explain the relative success or failure in capacity building. We rely upon Qualitative Comparative Analysis as we are particularly interested in different pathways to ensure successful National <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Societies.</b> Results : Our findings highlight that regular face-to-face contact is a particularly important element. This does not entirely come as a surprise, as monitoring and evaluation capacity building often implies tacit knowledge that is most effectively shared face-to-face. Furthermore, capacity building in conducting and, particularly, using evaluations entails building networks among the monitoring and evaluation supply and demand side which can most easily be done through regular face-to-face interaction. Conclusion : Our findings are not only theoretically interesting, they are also policy relevant; they hint at the fact that in an era of quick advances in technology, investing in face-to-face contact among members remains important...|$|R

Nonetheless, getting to grips with the institutionalisation of the discipline of evaluation and the building of an ongoing evaluation capacity turns out to be extremely difficult: Which are concrete measures of ECB? Who is responsible for the measures, for the implementation? What are the target groups? When has the ECB been successful? are only some of the questions that come up. ...|$|R

40|$|Homelessness as a {{political}} and social dominion {{has a number of}} features that make it particularly difficult to tackle. In addition to being a wicked problem, homelessness offers several analytical avenues. How do these characteristics affect the evaluation of programmes and projects aspiring to combat homelessness? Dissimilar pictures and solutions regarding homelessness in the US and in European countries will likely affect recommendations given as a result of evaluations performed. For this study, the empirical base is a sample of the most cited evaluations of homelessness programmes published in professional journals between 1996 and 2010. Most of these evaluations are from the US. These US evaluations more often use large-scale national programmes and quantitative methods, whereas <b>European</b> <b>evaluations</b> more often have smaller sample sizes and qualitative methods.

40|$|Background: Aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the efficacy of intravenous dexamethasone in acute management of VN patients and to determine the usefulness of VEMP in assessment of vestibular nerve damage in VN. [...] - Patients and methods: Patients with acute VN were included in the study and were randomised into two groups. Patients in group A received intravenous dexamethasone and patients in group B received placebo. Both groups of patients received symptomatic therapy as well. Before and 120 minutes after therapy the following parameters were recorded: degree of nystagmus, Fukuda test, number of vomiting, visual-analogue scale of nausea, <b>European</b> <b>Evaluation</b> of Vertigo questionnaire. All patients who gave consent underwent VEMP during seven days time from presentation. [...] - Results: A total of 100 patients were enrolled in the study, 52 (52 %) males and 48 (48 %) females. 51 (51 %) patients were randomized to receive dexamethasone and 49 (49 %) to receive placebo. In group A statistically significant smaller number of patients had III degree nystagmus after therapy compared with group B. After therapy, significantly more patients had I degree nystagmus in both gropus, which was more pronounced in group A. There was a statistically significant greater difference in <b>European</b> <b>Evaluation</b> of Vertigo questionnaire in group A compared with group B after therapy administration. Regarding the VEMP part of the study amplitudes on the affected side were significantly smaller than amplitudes on the healthy side. Conduction block on oVEMP was significantly more often present on the affected side than on the healthy side. The accuracy of AR was 71 % for oVEMP, meaning that it accurately detected 60 out of 84 affected sides. Of those 60 detected sides, 41 (68 %) had lower AR for cVEMP, meaning that the inferior branch was affected as well. [...] - Conclusion: Intravenous dexamethasone leads to a better recovery of nystagmus when compared to placebo and it has an ameliorating effect on symptoms as measured by <b>European</b> <b>Evaluation</b> of Vertigo questionnaire.
