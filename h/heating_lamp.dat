The electronic load cell device developed for measurement of HLU behavior of piglets could accurately and automatically record the number of piglets utilizing the <b>heat</b> <b>lamp</b> for the entire trial period, but it could not determine the lying patterns of the piglets;Dynamic HLU of piglets exposed to 250 W, 175 W, or 125 W <b>heat</b> <b>lamps</b> was measured during four production seasons. The results indicated that there was a consistent circadian pattern in HLU for all the <b>heat</b> <b>lamps</b> tested. HLU was significantly higher during the day than at night. The dynamic HLU behavior was greatly affected by the <b>heat</b> <b>lamp</b> size. The 175 W <b>heat</b> <b>lamp</b> produces the best piglet resting pattern. The thermal needs of neonatal piglets declines with increasing age;The effects of the lamp output and color on piglet behavior and performance were evaluated at two air temperatures of 18 (± 1. 5) °C and 27 (± 1. 5) °C, respectively.

40|$|Fuser roll {{temperature}} {{is one of}} the most important parameters affecting the performance of a xerographic fusing system. Temperature must be tightly controlled to ensure consistency of image permanence and quality, usually with a <b>heating</b> <b>lamp.</b> To reduce lighting flicker, International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) regulations limit the effects that the <b>heating</b> <b>lamp</b> can have on a mains power system. To meet these constraints, power delivery to the lamp is slowed down and transient performance of the temperature control system is reduced. This is especially prevalent at the start of a print job where the thermal system transitions from a low power state to a high one. An existing thermal model of a fusing system is extended to cover a range of printable media. The thermal and electrical behaviors of the <b>heating</b> <b>lamp</b> and power system are modeled. The fast power system model is solved ahead of time and results stored in a lookup table for use with the slower lamp and fuser thermal models. With a complete thermal and electrical model, the variability of the temperature transients observed experimentally is replicated. With the system characterized and with the development of a validated model, an open loop optimal control boundary value problem is formulated to minimize temperature transients while meeting the electrical constraints. After finding the solution for the nominal startup sequence, a second level optimization is carried out with. A control trajectory is found for the nominal case that narrowly misses the performance objective at the beginning of the job under the stress loading condition. Improving machine timing does not yield significant improvement. A simple feedforward controller is synthesized to use the optimal control results in a practical controller.
