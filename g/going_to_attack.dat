5|$|Following this defeat, Shiva {{abandons}} {{the plan}} of invading Meluha and leave for Pariha with Gopal; they wanted to procure the deadly Brahmastra weapon, to threaten the Meluhans for peace with them. There he meets the chief of Vayuputras, Mithra, who {{turns out to be}} his maternal uncle. Mithra convinces the Vayuputras that Shiva is the real Neelkanth and gives him the Pashupathiastra which acts on a specific target, rather than annihilating everything like the Brahmastra. Meanwhile, Parvateshwar uses decoy ships to give an impression to Kali that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> Panchavati. Alarmed, Kali takes the bait and leaves with the finest Naga soldiers in their pursuit. However, she realizes her folly and returns.|$|E
5|$|By September 1944, Ostojić {{had been}} {{promoted}} to lieutenant colonel, and was the Chetnik area commander in eastern Bosnia. In early September 1944, as Mihailović had been removed as Minister of the Army, Navy and Air Force with {{the demise of the}} Purić government-in-exile, Ostojić tried to make contact with Allied forces in Italy, and agreed with Lukačević to issue a proclamation to the people explaining that they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> the Germans. After 12 September 1944, when King Peter called for all in Yugoslavia to rally around Tito, he and Baćović warned Mihailović that their men were losing their will to fight the Partisans. Concerned that the Russians would hand the Chetniks over to the Partisans, he then contacted the United States Office of Strategic Services (OSS) liaison officer with the Chetniks, Colonel Robert H. McDowell, but was unable to arrange for the Chetniks to be placed under American command.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{positions}} were well-sited {{on the spur}} for an attack from the east along the track from Katika to Sattelberg, but at this point, Captain B. G. Cribb, the commander of D Company, 2/13th Infantry Battalion, came {{on the radio and}} announced that he was in contact with the Japanese to the west, and was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> from that direction. A furious fight ensured. The Japanese held their fire until the Australians were almost on top of them. Realising that the position was stronger than he had thought, Cribb withdrew after suffering eight dead and twenty wounded. Windeyer ordered the 2/17th to bypass the position and proceed to its objective, the high ground south of the Song River. The 2/15th was ordered to attack Katika Spur. The attack was delivered at 15:15 after a preliminary bombardment by 3 inch mortars, but the Japanese defenders had withdrawn, leaving behind eight dead. By nightfall, most of the brigade was on their objectives.|$|E

5|$|The German crusaders, {{accompanied}} by the papal legate and cardinal Theodwin, intended to meet the French in Constantinople. Ottokar III of Styria joined Conrad at Vienna, and Conrad's enemy Géza II of Hungary allowed them to pass through unharmed. When the German army of 20,000 men arrived in Byzantine territory, Emperor Manuel I Komnenos feared they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> him, and Byzantine troops were posted {{to ensure that there}} was no trouble. There was a brief skirmish with some of the more unruly Germans near Philippopolis and in Adrianople, where the Byzantine general Prosouch fought with Conrad's nephew, the future emperor Frederick. To make matters worse, some of the German soldiers were killed in a flood at the beginning of September. On 10 September, however, they arrived at Constantinople, where relations with Manuel were poor, resulting in a battle, after which the Germans were convinced that they should cross into Asia Minor as quickly as possible. Manuel wanted Conrad to leave some of his troops behind, to assist in defending against attacks from Roger II, who had taken the opportunity to plunder the cities of Greece, but Conrad did not agree, despite being a fellow enemy of Roger.|$|E

25|$|Eugène never led large {{formations}} into battle, yet Napoleon {{appointed him}} {{commander of the}} Army of Italy. To prepare his stepson Eugène for the role, the emperor wrote him many detailed letters advising him how to defend Italy. He urged Eugène to fall back from the Isonzo River line to the Piave River if the Austrians invaded in strength. Napoleon {{made the point that}} the Adige River was an extremely important strategic position. He did not believe Austria was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> in April and {{he did not want to}} provoke his enemy by massing his armies. Thus, Eugène's army remained somewhat dispersed.|$|E
25|$|Having reorganised {{his regular}} forces, Allenby won the Third Battle of Gaza (31 October – 7 November 1917) by {{surprising}} the defenders with an attack at Beersheba. The {{first step in}} capturing Beersheba was to send out false radio messages prompting the Turkish forces to think Britain was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> Gaza. After that, one brave intelligence officer, Colonel Richard Meinertzhagen, rode {{right up to the}} Turkish line, barely evading capture. In the fray, he dropped a bloodstained bag, smeared with horse blood, with fake military plans in it. The plans falsely described how the British force {{was on its way to}} capture Gaza. Additional radio messages threatening Meinertzhagen made up the Turkish Army’s mind: the British Army was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> Gaza. Instead, they went through with the capture of Beersheba. “The Turks at Beersheba were undoubtedly taken completely by surprise, a surprise from which the dash of London troops and Yeomanry, finely supported by their artillery, never gave them time to recover. The charge of the Australian Light Horse completed their defeat” – Allenby His force captured the water supply there, and was able to push onward through the desert. His force pushed northwards towards Jerusalem. “Favoured by a continuance of fine weather, preparation for a fresh advance against the Turkish positions... of Jerusalem proceeded rapidly” – Allenby The Ottomans were beaten at Junction Station (10–14 November), and retreated out of Jerusalem, which was on 9 December 1917.|$|E
25|$|After {{years of}} negotiation, three Great Powers, Russia, the United Kingdom, and France, decided to {{intervene}} in the conflict and each nation sent a navy to Greece. Following news that combined Ottoman–Egyptian fleets were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> the Greek island of Hydra, the allied fleet intercepted the Ottoman–Egyptian fleet at Navarino. After a week-long standoff, a battle began which resulted in the destruction of the Ottoman–Egyptian fleet. A French expeditionary force was dispatched to supervise the evacuation of the Egyptian army from the Peloponnese, while the Greeks proceeded to the captured part of Central Greece by 1828. As a result of years of negotiation, the nascent Greek state was finally recognized under the London Protocol in 1830.|$|E

25|$|Operation Tindall was a {{deception}} {{that the}} British and Americans were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> Norway, with the hypothetical goal of capturing Stavanger and its airfield. Stavanger and its airfield were {{critical to the}} story, for once again the Allies were planning a deception operation beyond the range of tactical air support and needed to increase the plausibility of the plan. The five divisions that were {{to be used in}} the sham invasion were real divisions camped in Scotland and the Allies had adequate aircraft and ships in Scotland to make the deception plan plausible. The only shortfall the Allies had with Tindall was their lack of military gliders. The Allies hoped Tindall would induce the Germans to retain the 12 divisions they had assigned to Norway.|$|E

By 1828 the Egyptian army withdrew under pressure of a French expeditionary force to which the Ottoman garrisons in the Peloponnese then surrendered, while the Greeks proceeded to the Ottoman-controlled part of central Greece. As a result of years of negotiation, Greece was finally recognized as an independent nation in the Treaty of Constantinople of May 1832.|$|E

25|$|Codrington's Asia (84) was {{anchored}} between Ottoman admiral Capitan Bey's flagship, Fahti Bahri (74), and Egyptian Moharram Bey's frigate Guerrière (60). Capitan Bey opened fire, but Moharram Bey {{sent word}} to Codrington {{that he was}} not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>attack.</b> This enabled Asia to concentrate its fire on Fahti Bahri, which was in a poor condition and inadequately manned. Asias deadly fire shortly disabled her. Codrington then sent an interpreter, Greek P. Mikelis, to parley with Moharram Bey; but Mikelis was shot dead as he went aboard. Guerrière then opened fire, but was reduced to a burning wreck within 20 minutes by crushing broadsides from Asia and Azov. However, Asia suffered severe casualties and damage due to a concentration of heavy fire from smaller Ottoman boats {{in the second and third}} lines of the Ottoman formation: as Letellier had planned, these boats fired through the gaps in the front line. Codrington also believed that Asia had taken serious hits by mistake from sister Genoa.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{program of}} {{lend-lease}} {{was extended to}} Soviet Union in September 1941, supplying planes, tanks, trucks and other war materials. Eventually the Soviets managed to slow the Wehrmacht's blitzkrieg, halting the Nazi offensive in December 1941 outside the gates of Moscow, in part because mobilized troops with winterized clothing from Siberia were transferred from there after Stalin realized that Japan was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> the Soviet Union (Japan had just attacked Pearl Harbor). The Red Army launched a powerful winter counteroffensive which pushed the Germans back from the outskirts of Moscow. At the start of 1942, the weakened Axis armies abandoned their march on Moscow and advanced south towards the Caucasus and Volga river. This offensive, in turn, ran out of steam in autumn 1942, allowing the Soviet forces to stage a devastating counteroffensive on the overextended enemy. The Red Army encircled and destroyed significant German forces at the Battle of Stalingrad, which ended in February 1943 and reversed the tide {{of the war in}} Europe.|$|E
