Under the guidance of Chief Counsel John Doar and senior member Bernard W. Nussbaum, Rodham helped research procedures of <b>impeachment</b> and the historical grounds and standards for <b>impeachment.</b> The committee's work culminated in the resignation of President Richard Nixon in August 1974.|$|E

5|$|The President of Croatia is impeachable for any {{violation}} of the Constitution committed in performance of duty. <b>Impeachment</b> proceedings may be initiated by the Parliament of Croatia by a two-thirds majority vote of {{all members of the}} parliament. The <b>impeachment</b> of the president is then decided by the Constitutional Court, by a two-thirds majority vote of all its judges. If the Constitutional Court impeaches the president, the president's term is terminated.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the veto}} {{question}} became central, the ministers were {{not out of}} the spotlight. Since the ministers were inferior to the King within the executive branch, the King was responsible for all actions conducted by this branch; however, the ministers were responsible for the advice given to the King when they were assembled in the Council of State. If any ministers were to dissent, according to the Constitution, they had to state this explicitly in the meeting protocol, lest they be considered in agreement and thus co-responsible. The King was above the law, but the Prime Minister and his cabinet could be tried for <b>Impeachment</b> for advising the King to act out an unconstitutional veto. The <b>Impeachment</b> Court consisted of Supreme Court Justices and elected politicians from the Lagting, and as the latter group held a two-thirds majority, an <b>Impeachment</b> trial with a fairly certain outcome could start as soon as the liberals won control over the Lagting seats through general elections.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, Zardari relented, and the {{coalition}} agreed to proceed full speed towards Musharraf's <b>impeachment</b> by drafting a charge-sheet against him. The coalition charged him with high treason for the 1999 coup and the imposition of martial law. He warned Musharraf against dismissing Parliament, and {{the coalition}} selected Gillani instead of Musharraf to represent Pakistan at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. On 18 August, Musharraf resigned {{in order to avoid}} <b>impeachment.</b> Although Zardari favoured granting Musharraf immunity from prosecution, the coalition could not agree on a decision. The coalition also could not reach a united stance {{on the future of the}} judiciary.|$|E

5|$|In early 1991, the ADOC {{coalition}} {{began to}} unravel as Endara, Arias, and Ford publicly criticized one another. On April 8, accusing Arias' Christian Democrats of not rallying to his support during an <b>impeachment</b> vote, Endara dismissed Arias from the cabinet.|$|E
5|$|In {{the prelude}} to the <b>impeachment</b> of President Clinton, Ford conferred with former President Carter and the two agreed to not speak {{publicly}} on the controversy, a pact broken by Carter when answering a question from a student at Emory University.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Jennings was {{the first}} Governor to have an {{attempted}} <b>impeachment</b> brought against him {{in response to his}} actions as an agent of the federal government during the negotiations of the Treaty of St. Mary's in 1819, illegal under Indiana's constitution. The evidence of his role was destroyed, and after two months of investigation the proceedings were dropped. The only other time was when the General Assembly attempted to bring <b>impeachment</b> proceedings against Governor James B. Ray for a similar action in 1826, but the action was also defeated 28–30.|$|E

5|$|Other {{business}} in the session included creating a special fund that would allow Jefferson to recover the USS Philadelphia, which had been captured {{off the coast of}} northern Africa, and the repeal of the Bankruptcy Act of 1800; Breckinridge supported the passage of both measures. He feared that passage of an act making permanent the pay raises for executive administrative personnel first enacted in 1799 would hurt his party in the upcoming elections, especially in the House, but the act passed and there was no significant backlash at the polls. Robert Wright's measure adjourning Congress to Baltimore, Maryland, in protest of legislators' poor accommodations in Washington, D.C., was defeated by a vote of 9–19, but Breckinridge considered the issue of moving the U.S. capital worthy of further study. Breckinridge supported the successful <b>impeachment</b> of federal judge John Pickering and also served on the Senate committee that prepared the rules governing the <b>impeachment</b> of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase. The latter <b>impeachment</b> was widely seen as politically motivated, and some Democratic-Republicans joined the Federalist minority in voting for acquittal. Majorities were obtained on only three of the eight articles of <b>impeachment,</b> and each of those fell at least three votes short of the required two-thirds majority. Breckinridge and three other Democratic-Republicans voted to convict on every article except the fifth, on which every senator sided with Chase.|$|E

5|$|The {{legal battle}} over the tapes {{continued}} through early 1974, and in April 1974 Nixon announced the release of 1,200 pages of transcripts of White House conversations {{between him and his}} aides. The House Judiciary Committee opened <b>impeachment</b> hearings against the President on May 9, 1974, which were televised on the major TV networks. These hearings culminated in votes for <b>impeachment.</b> On July 24, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the full tapes, not just selected transcripts, must be released.|$|E
5|$|The {{office of}} Vice President had been vacant sixteen times {{due to the}} death or {{resignation}} of the Vice President or his succession to the presidency. For example, there was no Vice President for nearly {{four years after the}} assassination of Abraham Lincoln. During the <b>impeachment</b> of Andrew Johnson there was no Vice President to succeed him. At that time, the Presidential Succession Act of 1792 provided that the President pro tempore of the Senate would succeed Johnson if he was removed from office. Had the <b>impeachment</b> trial of Andrew Johnson resulted in Johnson being removed from office, Senator Benjamin Wade, then the President pro tempore of the Senate, would have become acting president pending a special presidential election.|$|E

5|$|With the {{encouragement}} of his Protestant advisers, James summoned the English Parliament in 1624 {{so that he could}} request subsidies for a war. Charles and Buckingham supported the <b>impeachment</b> of the Lord Treasurer, Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex, who opposed war on grounds of cost and who quickly fell in much the same manner as Bacon had. James told Buckingham he was a fool, and presciently warned his son that he would live to regret the revival of <b>impeachment</b> as a parliamentary tool. An under-funded makeshift army under Ernst von Mansfeld set off to recover the Palatinate, but it was so poorly provisioned that it never advanced beyond the Dutch coast.|$|E
5|$|A House select {{committee}} headed by John Quincy Adams, an ardent abolitionist who disliked slaveholders like Tyler, condemned the president's {{use of the}} veto and assailed his character. While the committee's report did not formally recommend <b>impeachment,</b> it clearly established the possibility, and in August 1842 the House endorsed the committee's report. Adams sponsored {{a constitutional amendment to}} change both houses' two-thirds requirement (for overriding vetoes) to a simple majority, but neither house approved. The Whigs were unable to pursue further <b>impeachment</b> proceedings in the subsequent 28th Congress—in the elections of 1842 they retained a majority in the Senate but lost control of the House. Near the end of Tyler's term in office, on March 3, 1845, Congress overrode his veto of a minor bill relating to revenue cutters—the first override of a presidential veto.|$|E
5|$|As the Watergate saga unfolded, the ACLU {{became the}} first {{national}} organization to call for Nixon's <b>impeachment.</b> This, following the resolution opposing the Vietnam war, was a second major decision that caused critics of the ACLU, particularly conservatives, {{to claim that the}} ACLU had evolved into a liberal political organization.|$|E
