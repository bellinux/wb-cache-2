6000|$|... "All the same," [...] said Dorothy, [...] "I'm mighty <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{make this}} tent appear, with our dinners and beds all ready for us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm so <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> let me!" [...] he said, [...] "and I {{want to ask}} you {{now when}} I may come again. But if you need me, you'll----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir. He {{said on the}} {{telephone}} {{that he had been}} arrested and would be <b>glad</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> step round and bail him out." ...|$|R
6000|$|Manston {{instantly}} {{came back}} and spoke to Anne in an undertone. 'I should be <b>glad</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> retire to your room for a short time.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No objections!" [...] echoed Will; [...] "I'll {{be delighted}} to have your company, and would be only too <b>glad</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> go all the way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm so <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{come to my}} party. Oh, I {{must speak}} to you about----Do you suppose you would ever get very, very angry at poor me? Me so bad sometimes." ...|$|E
6000|$|A Wrangerton {{face had}} great charms, {{though it was}} starched and severe, without one smile in answer to the joyous greeting, 'Well, Sarah, I am <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> come. How are they all?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well." [...] She put {{her hand}} on his arm and he felt it tremble there, while she palpitated, [...] "We are all so <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> go on to Rotterdam. My mother wanted me to tell you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, Babbitt, while she's away--I {{know you}} don't care much for booze-fights, but the Missus and I'd be awfully <b>glad</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> come in some night. Think <b>you</b> <b>could</b> stand a good {{cocktail}} for once?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How are you, Mrs. Pickett?" [...] said Mr. Snyder genially. [...] "I'm very <b>glad</b> that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{find time}} to pay me a visit. Well, so it wasn't murder after all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your Highness," [...] {{the latter}} said, [...] "His Grace has {{sent me to}} look for you. He would be <b>glad</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> spare him {{a moment or two}} in the library." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{had been}} {{frowning}} {{as he came}} in and fingering a long thin green book of verses, but she glowed at Mr. Wrenn as though he were her most familiar friend, murmuring, [...] "Mouse dear, I'm so <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> come in." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{was in a}} panic. But the hostess, {{instead of}} calling for the police, gushed, [...] "So <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> come!" [...] {{combining}} a kittenish mechanical smile for him with a glance {{over his shoulder at}} the temporary butler. [...] "I want you to meet Miss Moeller, Mr.--uh--Mr----" ...|$|E
6000|$|Margaret drew in her lip {{before she}} answered, without {{apparent}} {{resentment of the}} awkwardness or ungraciousness, whichever she found it: [...] "I don't wonder! You become so absorbed in such work that you think nothing else is worth while. But I'm glad Mr. Dryfoos could come with you; I'm so <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> all come; I knew you would enjoy the music. Do sit down--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{require a}} special train to London {{as quickly as}} possible," [...] he announced. [...] "I should be <b>glad</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> let me have one within half an hour, at any rate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon, sir," [...] he began, {{addressing}} Francis. [...] "Sir Timothy has been asking {{if you are}} still here. He would be very <b>glad</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> spare him {{a moment in the}} library." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The reason I {{mention it}} is this, {{that we should}} be so very <b>glad</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> be here. We all love you so much, and I should so like to have you here on that day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{sorry you}} have to go so early." [...] Gertie {{carefully}} stuck her embroidery needle into her doily, rolled up the doily meticulously, laid it down on the center-table, straightened the pile of magazines which Carl had deranged, and rose. [...] "But I'm <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> drop up this evening. Come up any time you haven't anything better to do. Oh--what about our tramp? If you know some place that is better than Bronx Park, we might try it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Certainly Bader, {{had he been}} present, {{would have}} {{instantly}} recognised the stranger in the dark raincoat. Stomping over to his side, he would have banged {{him on the back}} and bellowed: [...] "Bloody good show, <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> come!" [...] Peter Tory ...|$|E
40|$|Dr. Edward Wax {{carefully}} {{inserted the}} cassette in the player as {{he glanced at}} the other four sitting around the conference table. 2 ̆ 2 I 2 ̆ 7 m <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> find the time to listen to my problem, 2 ̆ 2 he began. 2 ̆ 2 I realize that the Psychiatric Institute is ordinarily concerned with research into phobias or psychological aberrations that have resisted treatment by the foremost psychiatrists, not the routine neuroses encountered by a GP like myself. Were it not for my neighbor, Mr. Pfund of your Institute, I suppose I should never have been given this hearing. 2 ̆ 2 He nodded toward the short cherubic man sitting across from him...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dr. McCarthy," [...] said I, [...] "this is all {{a mystery}} to me. I should be <b>glad</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> explain to me who this man is, and why you have tolerated him so long in your house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{sure that}} we shall be very happy to have your assistance, Mr. Weld," [...] said he, after a few {{professional}} questions. [...] "Mr. Percival Manners left me yesterday, and I should be <b>glad</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> take over his duties to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{only speak}} as an outsider," [...] said I. [...] "And now I must leave you, for I {{have a long}} walk before me. Your story has {{interested}} me so much that I should be <b>glad</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> let me know the sequel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} <b>glad</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> tell me of some little place where I could {{put up in}} Brussels; some place where I could stay while looking out for work, without anyone troubling {{themselves}} as to whence I came or where I am going, or what are my views as to religion or politics." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want the}} team, if I {{can get it}} at a {{reasonable}} figure; they're real good beasts with the imported Percheron strain strong in them," [...] he said. [...] "It will {{be a while before}} they're put up, and I'd be <b>glad</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> ride round and let Flora know what's keeping me. I'd an idea she expected there might be some trouble to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{so sorry}} my aunt's Thursdays are over; she never has them after Lent, but we're {{to have some}} people Tuesday evening at a little concert which a musical friend {{is going to give}} with some other artists. There won't be any banjos, I'm afraid, but there'll be some very good singing, and my aunt would be so <b>glad</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> come with your mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} you do, being sore as a galled horse just now. But listen, Allan, and you, too, prédicant Quatermain; {{there are other}} and more {{important}} reasons than this petty squabble why I should be <b>glad</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> go away for a while. I must take counsel with my countrymen about certain secret matters which {{have to do with}} our welfare and future, and, of course they would not like it if all the while there were two Englishmen on the place, whom they might think were spies." ...|$|R
5000|$|Of this letter, {{there are}} two {{passages}} in particular on which critics tend to focus. In the first, which is crossed out in the original manuscript, Fanny tells Brown: “I was more generous ten years ago, I should not now endure the odium of being connected with one who was working up his way against poverty and every sort of abuse.” The second, which is not crossed out, reads: “I should be <b>glad</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> disprove I was a very poor judge of character ten years ago and probably overrated every good quality he had but surely they go too far on the other side.” ...|$|R
6000|$|That your {{literary}} work has never {{interfered with the}} discharge of your official duties, I may assume {{to be at least}} as well known to your colleagues as it is to me. It is idle to say that if the post were in my gift you should have it, because you have had, for some years, most of the posts of high trust that have been at my disposal. An excellent public servant in your literary sphere of action, I should be heartily <b>glad</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have this new opportunity of distinguishing yourself in the same character. And this is at least unselfish in me, for I suppose I should then lose you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd be very <b>glad</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> tell {{me where}} that lady may be," [...] Peters {{answered}} coolly. [...] "I've a bill against her for nearly a hundred pounds, and {{nothing to show for}} it but a couple of trumpery pendants that the dealer would hardly look at. She attached herself to Mrs. Peters and me at Baden--it is a fact that I was using another name at the time--and she stuck on to us until we came to London. I paid her bill and her ticket. Once in London, she gave us the slip, and, as I say, left these out-of-date jewels to pay her bills. You find her, Mr. Holmes, and I'm your debtor." ...|$|R
5000|$|Within a few days, the British {{press was}} commenting {{that these were}} not Goethe's words at all but words put into his mouth by Thomas Mann in the seventh chapter of his novel Lotte in Weimar. On 16 August 1946 Mann, then living in Pacific Palisades, California, {{received}} a letter from the British ambassador in Washington inquiring “whether you put the words into Goethe’s mouth or whether they are an actual quotation from the latter’s works. If they do represent an actual quotation, I should be very <b>glad</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> let me know in which work they appear. It is, of course, possible that they are a passage from a contemporary or later commentator. Should this be the case, perhaps you would be good enough to say where you got them from.” ...|$|R
60|$|MY DEAR HOWELLS,--I am <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> think I <b>could</b> do Hayes any good, for I {{have been}} wanting {{to write a letter}} or make a speech to that end. I'll be careful not to do either, however, until the {{opportunity}} comes in a natural, justifiable and unlugged way; and shall not then do anything unless I've got it all digested and worded just right. In which case I might do some good--in any other I should do harm. When a humorist ventures upon the grave concerns of life he must do his job better than another man or he works harm to his cause.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he observed, [...] "I'm <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> {{have told}} me about the thing; but I'm {{somewhat}} surprised that you didn't realize that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have disarmed Nevis--and freed yourself--by mentioning it earlier." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> did, my poor boy,' said Mr. Cope. 'But {{one thing}} more. Tell me how, {{with such a}} man as this, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have learnt about the Bible and Catechism, as you have done.' ...|$|R
60|$|Wood. I am <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> did; for <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not but observe, {{with how}} much care I avoided all {{occasions}} of railing at you; to which she urged me, like a malicious woman, as she was.|$|R
