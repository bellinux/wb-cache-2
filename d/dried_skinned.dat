40|$|Etiopathogenesis and {{treatment}} of <b>dry</b> <b>skin</b> Up to {{now there is no}} one commonly accepted definition of <b>dry</b> <b>skin.</b> Although the term <b>dry</b> <b>skin</b> (xerosis) is frequently used in medicine, its definition is based on symptomatology and subjective symptoms reported by the patient. Clinically, <b>dry</b> <b>skin</b> shows the symptoms of contraction, roughness, dryness and desquamation. Ruptures in the epidermis are also present. The lesions usually occur on the erythemous background. These clinical symptoms are accompanied by subjective discomfort and itching. <b>Dry</b> <b>skin</b> is very sensitive to physical and mechanical stimuli, prone to eczema and can be easily damaged. It is not only a problem of a cosmetic nature but may be indicative of numerous diseases. Nowadays, it is a very common problem which affects 15 – 20 % of the population (15). Various endogenous and exogenous factors can be the cause of <b>dry</b> <b>skin.</b> Endogenous factors include genetically determined dermatological diseases such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and ichtyosis (12). Systemic diseases which lead to <b>dry</b> <b>skin</b> include diabetes, hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure, neoplastic diseases or cachexy. Many conditions whose symptoms include disorders of sweat or sebum secretion, such as neurological disorders or AIDS, are also characterized by the presence of <b>dry</b> <b>skin.</b> In states of dehydration induced by fever, diarrhoea, vomiting or drugs...|$|R

In a people with diabetes, <b>dry</b> <b>skin</b> {{has the potential to}} progress to cracking and fissuring creating a portal of entry for bacteria. The causes of the <b>dry</b> <b>skin</b> are varied and often multifactorial. Research evidence investigating the management of this condition using emollients is limited to a few small scale studies coupled with clinical experience. This paper will review how <b>dry</b> <b>skin</b> may develop, focussing on the diabetic foot, and suggest an approach to managing this common condition...|$|R

50|$|Different {{types of}} cleansers have been {{developed}} for people with different skin types. Active cleansers are more suitable for oily skins to prevent breakouts. But they may overdry and irritate <b>dry</b> <b>skin,</b> this may make the skin appear and feel worse. Very <b>dry</b> <b>skin</b> may require a creamy lotion-type cleanser. These are normally too gentle to be effective on oily or even normal <b>skin,</b> but <b>dry</b> <b>skin</b> requires much less cleansing power. It may {{be a good idea to}} select a cleanser that is alcohol-free for use on dry, sensitive, or dehydrated skin.|$|R
40|$|Previously we {{observed}} that domestic pigs housed at 10 % relative humidity develop visually <b>dry</b> <b>skin</b> which responds to treatment with known human skin conditioning materials [J. Soc. Cosmet. Chem., 34, 317 - 326 (1983) ]. Here, glycerol {{is shown to}} improve <b>dry</b> <b>skin</b> visually on this animal model in a dose-dependent manner. There is an accompanying increase in skin levels of glycerol. Near-maximum effec-tiveness is achieved with once-to-twice-a-day application of a 20 % aqueous olution. At 80 % or greater, glycerol is as effective as petrolatum. Key results obtained with glycerol on the pig <b>dry</b> <b>skin</b> model are confirmed in human testing. Testing of aqueous olutions of several other polyols in the pig <b>dry</b> <b>skin</b> model indicates that volatile liquid and crystalline polyols are at best poor skin conditioners...|$|R
40|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>skin</b> is {{a common}} problem which affects wound healing, {{severity}} of other skin diseases {{and quality of life}} of people. One of its undesirable effects is fissure that is a cutaneous condition {{in which there is a}} linear loss of epidermis and dermis with sharply defined, nearly vertical walls. In the present study, we have investigated the etiology of the disease and its treatments in conventional medicine and Iranian Traditional Medicine (ITM). Two traditional medicine references, current scientific data bases and medicinal texts were explored with the selected keywords such as "sheqaq-e-poosti", "skin fissure" and "dry skin" to find the etiology and treatment of skin fissure. From the view point of both conventional medicine and ITM, <b>dry</b> <b>skin</b> is the cause of skin fissure and some causes of <b>dry</b> <b>skin</b> are similar. In conventional medicine, moisturizers are mainly used for treatment of dry skin; while in ITM some herbs, oils and other natural remedies have been used. A topical dosage form which was called "qeirooti", a mixture of wax and oil, was used to treat skin fissure in ITM. It comprised of oily ingredients that acted as occlusives and also some herbal components that directly improved <b>dry</b> <b>skin</b> (similar to moisturizers). Components efficacy of traditional dosage forms for treatment of <b>dry</b> <b>skin</b> lead us to study about formulation of “qeirooti” for treatment of <b>dry</b> <b>skin...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>skin,</b> {{which refers}} to roughened, flaky, or scaly skin that is less {{flexible}} than normal and dry to feel, is relatively common problem in all age groups, but {{is more common in}} elderly individuals. The water content of the stratum corneum is of paramount importance in maintaining the normal appearance and texture of human skin. The relative hydration of the stratum corneum is a composite of 3 factors viz. the rate of water transport from dermis to stratum corneum, the rate of surface loss of water and the rate of water binding ability of stratum corneum. Loss of integrity of the barrier function is a central factor in the development of <b>dry</b> <b>skin</b> conditions and eczema. The various factors involved in producing <b>dry</b> <b>skin,</b> various causes of <b>dry</b> <b>skin</b> and the role of emollients in the management of these conditions are discussed...|$|R

40|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>skin,</b> senile {{freckles}} and wrinkles are major symptoms of aged <b>skin.</b> <b>Dry</b> <b>skin</b> {{is caused by}} the decrease of skin surface lipids, natural moisturizing factors and intercellular lipids of the stratum corneum. Senile freckles are the deposition of melanin pigments on the basal layer of the epidermis which is brought about by the activation of melanocytes through UV exposure and the delay in the turnover rate of epidermal cells due to aging. Wrinkles are caused by UV-induced damage to collagen and elastic fibers of the dermis. For <b>dry</b> <b>skin,</b> emollient cream is recommended during the winter season.

40|$|Natural <b>dried</b> <b>skin</b> {{and leather}} {{which comes from}} fresh skin {{has been used for}} many {{applications}} in the automotive sector, furniture, clothes and other industries. However, the biomechanical properties of these materials have not been well established. Therefore, this study attempts to quantify and investigate the parameters o f fresh goat skin (Category I), natural <b>dried</b> <b>skin</b> (Category II) and leather (Category III), which also include orthotropic analysis (longitudinal and transverse directions). Uniaxial tensile test (ASTM D 2099 - 00) was conducted to obtain engineering stress-stretch data for all categories. Analytical and numerical approaches were also adapted to quantify the material parameters. Engineering stress-stretch curves for both approaches were fitted to the experiment data by adapting three hyperelastic materials models (i. e. neo- Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin and Ogden). Numerical approach adapting the Ogden model is likely the best hyperelastic material model in representing the parameters o f fresh goat <b>skin,</b> natural <b>dried</b> <b>skin</b> and leather. For each category, the Ogden parameters (a and |j.) range value were found from 15. 154 to 18. 344 and from 0. 152 MPa to 0. 277 MPa (Category I), from 0. 675 to 5. 652 and from 107. 416 MPa to 1185. 859 MPa (Category II) from 14. 815 to 15. 885 and from 1. 827 MPa to 4. 441 MPa (Category III) respectively.

40|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>skin</b> {{pruritus}} {{is common}} in the elderly. Recent reports show that T-cell signal path is involved in <b>dry</b> <b>skin</b> pruritus. Zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP 70), as a T-cell receptor, may induce interleukin 2 (IL- 2) secretion and promote nerve growth factor (NGF) secretion in skin. This study aimed to detect the alteration of ZAP 70 in a mice model with <b>dry</b> <b>skin</b> pruritus. The C 57 BL mice with 5 months and 22 months were used as experimental animal. Following a 5 -day period of treatment of back {{with a mixture of}} acetone-diethyl-ether-water (AEW), mice exhibited a significant increase in spontaneous scratching behavior directed to the treated back compared to control animals in which back was similarly treated with water only (W). After AEW process, spontaneous scratching in 22 -month AEW mice was increased compared to 5 -month AEW mice. Western blot and real-time quantitative PCR data analysis showed that ZAP 70 expression was significantly increased in 22 -month AEW mice compared with 5 -month AEW mice. ELISA data showed that secretions of IL- 2 and NGF in 22 -month AEW mice were higher than 5 -month AEW mice. Our results indicate that increased ZAP 70 is involved in <b>dry</b> <b>skin</b> in elderly pruritus. Increased secretion of IL- 2 and NGF may induce <b>dry</b> <b>skin</b> itch...|$|R
