40|$|The Generic Frame Protocol (GFP) is an {{application}} program interface for accessing knowledge bases stored in frame knowledge representation systems (FRSs). GFP provides a uniform model of FRSs based on a common conceptualization of frames, slots, facets, and inheritance. GFP consists {{of a set of}} Common Lisp functions that provide a generic interface to underlying FRSs. This interface isolates {{an application}} from many of the idiosyncrasies of specific FRS software and enables the development of generic tools (e. g., graphical browsers, <b>frame</b> <b>editors)</b> that operate on many FRSs. To date, GFP has been used as an interface to LOOM, Ontolingua, THEO, and SIPE- 2. ...|$|R

Issues #30 (March 1973) to #40 (April 1974) were edited by Connor McKnight, with Andy Childs becoming editor from issue #42 (June 1974) for about 18 months. Andy Childs originally had his own fanzine, Fat Angel. This period was marked by more musical British influence such as pub rock and the precursor of punk (Dr. Feelgood, The Stranglers). Pete <b>Frame</b> became <b>editor</b> again from issue #58 (March 1976) to issue #74 (July 1977) - with the exception of three of those issues where Paul Kendall was editor. Appointed as editor in August 1977, a major revolution was led by Kris Needs which saw ZigZag going though a third period where {{the magazine was}} totally devoted to punk. It was also around this time that Pete Frame distanced himself and published the first book of his famous series of 'rock trees' tracing changing personnel line-ups in the rock music world.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — With {{the advent}} of tiny {{networked}} devices, Mark Weiser’s vision of a world embedded with invisible computers is coming to age. Due to their small size and relative ease of deployment, sensor networks have been utilized by zoologists, seismologists and military personnel. In this paper, we investigate the novel application of sensor networks to the film industry. In particular, {{we are interested in}} augmenting film and video footage with sensor data. Unobtrusive sensors are deployed on a film set or in a television studio and on performers. During a filming of a scene, sensor data such as light intensity, color temperature and location are collected and synchronized with each film or video <b>frame.</b> Later, <b>editors,</b> graphics artists and programmers can view this data in synchronization with film and video playback. For example, such data can help define a new level of seamless integration between computer graphics and real world photography. A real-time version of our system would allow sensor data to trigger camera movement and cue special effects. In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of the first part of our embedded film set environment, the augmented recording system. Augmented recording is a foundational component for the UCLA Hypermedia Studio’s research into the use of sensor networks in film and video production. In addition, we have evaluated our system in a television studio. I...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a {{consensus}} among biblical scholars that the epilogue of Ecclesiastes (Eccl 12 : 9 - 14) was written by an editor-the same one who supplied {{the title of the}} book, 2 ̆ 2 The words of Qohelet, song of David, king in Jerusalem 2 ̆ 2 (1 : 1) -in order to frame 2 ̆ 2 the words of Qohelet 2 ̆ 2 in a particular way. According to this understanding, the editor was someone of a mainstream religious viewpoint, whose advice to 2 ̆ 2 fear God and obey His commandments 2 ̆ 2 (12 : 14) served to package Qohelet 2 ̆ 7 s more radical teachings in a framework that renders their radicalism harmless. The rabbinic remark that Ecclesiastes was accepted into the canon because 2 ̆ 2 its beginning is words of Torah and its end is words of Torah, 2 ̆ 2 though not based on a two-voice theory of the composition of the book, provides an early attestation of the book as a radical teaching within a normative frame. The medieval commentator Samuel B. Meir (Rashbam), in his comments to 1 : 2 and 12 : 8, was apparently the first to attribute the <b>frame</b> to <b>editors</b> other than Qohelet, but he does not suggest that the editors were trying to tame the book 2 ̆ 7 s radical content...|$|R
40|$|This book is an {{engaging}} collection of eighteen short articles written by fourteen different historians {{from a range}} of backgrounds, including both Africanists and non-Africanists.

Yerxa, as <b>editor,</b> <b>frames</b> the discussions in terms of the challenges that face historians (and therefore also archaeologists) today, specifically, “constructing narratives that give coherence to a messy and complex past without sacrificing its richness and texture ” (p. 3). It is a short book with plenty to digest, although its ease of reading makes it deceptive in terms of its depth and complexity. The bulk of the text consists of two discussions, one centered around defining Africa and its place in world history, and the other concerning the veracity of Olaudah Equiano’s historical account.
