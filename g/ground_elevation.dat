25|$|Fife left {{medical school}} and was {{commissioned}} Second Lieutenant in U.S. Army in June 1939. Fife then reported to the 15th Infantry at Fort Lewis, Washington for training in Aug 1940. After receiving his basic infantry training, he reported to the 60th Infantry at Fort Bragg in North Carolina where he served as an Assistant Operations Officer in September 1940. Fife volunteered for the 18th class of Parachute Jump School in Fort Benning, Georgia in April 1942. Following his training in May 1942, he joined the newly formed 503rd parachute infantry battalion as Company Commander. As Company Commanding Officer of the 503rd parachute infantry regiment in Sept 1943, Fife led his company in a jump in the Markham Valley, New Guinea. This was the first successful airborne combat jump in the Pacific Theater of Operations. His first combat jump was planned with the <b>ground</b> <b>elevation</b> 500 feet lower than it actually was and Fife {{found himself in a}} coconut tree.

40|$|Lidar {{and digital}} stereo-photogrammetry {{techniques}} {{are being developed}} to improve on current methods used to map forest canopy height. Contrary to lidar, the latter technique is limited in that is {{does not have the}} capacity to automatically produce dense and accurate information on the <b>ground</b> <b>elevations</b> needed to calculate height. We propose a new canopy height mapping approach that combines both techniques. First, the photogrammetric digital surface model of the canopy and the lidar <b>ground</b> <b>elevations</b> are coregistered. Then the elevation differences between the two models are computed to produce a composite canopy height model (CHM). We demonstrate that the composite CHM constitute a smoothed version of the corresponding lidar CHM. The correlation between composite heights and lidar-only heights are of 0. 79 and 0. 96 respectively for point wise and plot wise comparisons. 1...|$|R

The elevations generated by the on-board C-band sensor represent surface elevations in “bare earth ” regions, and the elevations of various scatterers such as leaves and branches in other regions. Elevations generated by a medium-footprint (� 10 m diameter) laser altimeter (lidar) system known as NASA’s Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) were used to assess the accuracy of SRTM elevations at study sites of variable relief, and landcover. Five study sites in Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Hampshire, and Costa Rica were chosen where coincident LVIS and SRTM data occur. Both ground and canopy top lidar elevations were compared to the SRTM elevations. In “bare earth ” regions, the mean vertical offset between the SRTM <b>elevations</b> and LVIS <b>ground</b> <b>elevations</b> varied with study site and was approximately 0. 0 m, 0. 5 m, 3. 0 m, 4. 0 m, and 4. 5 m at the Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Costa Rica study sites, respectively. In vegetated regions, the mean vertical offset increased, implying the phase center fell above the ground, and the offset varied by region. The SRTM elevations fell on average approximately 14 m below the LVIS canopy top elevations, except in Costa Rica where they were approximately 8 m below the canopy top. At all five study sites, SRTM elevations increased with increasing vertical extent (i. e., the difference between the LVIS canopy top and <b>ground</b> <b>elevations</b> and analogous to canopy height in vegetated regions). A linear relationship was found sufficient to describe the relationship between the SRTM-LVIS elevation difference and canopy vertical extent...|$|R
