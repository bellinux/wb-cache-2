Not long after World War I, a submarine cable was installed from Eastern Passage, receiving power from Dartmouth {{and on the}} highest point of land, right next to a <b>frost-proof</b> cement cistern built 20 years prior, a 360,000-litre (80,000 imperial gallon) water tower was erected, thus solving the problem of {{a steady flow of}} fresh water on the island.|$|E

A trade journal published in April of that year indicated: “The plant of the Philip Haas Co., Dayton, Ohio, manufacturer of the Haas <b>Frost-proof</b> Water Closets and other specialties, was damaged by the floods {{to the extent of}} $5,000. The plant was under water to the depth of 16 feet, but the company expects to be in active operation again by April 20. No loss of life was suffered by anyone connected with the company.” ...|$|E
50|$|Most of Haas' {{early work}} as an {{inventor}} focused on the improvement of <b>frost-proof</b> toilets. It was in this field that, on February 10, 1903, he was issued his first two patents, numbers 720,021 and 720,022. At the time, many toilets were located in unheated spaces, such as outbuildings and warehouses. During periods of cold weather, bursting of pipes and stoppages were constant problems. Frost-free toilets had no water in the bowl and relied on a water supply from below the frost line in the soil. Haas’ innovations in this field would provide few lasting benefits. That is because, {{over the next few}} decades, frost-free toilets faded into obscurity as sanitary facilities were moved within the envelopes of heated buildings.|$|E

The general interest taken in rye by prairie authorities of high repute, on the grounds already advanced, can have only one lesson to teach, viz:- "That the production of Rye under prairie conditions is possible, advisable, and profitable. " The increasing interest, and the satisfactory results obtained, far exceed any disadvantages which may attend it, and a sane introduction of rye on many farms may provide {{to be the best}} thing possible for the finnancial and agricultural salvation of the prairie farmer...|$|E

The coefficient of dynamic viscosity of polymeric suspension or the initial module of a viscoelasticity of the join solidification low-molecular rubbers with the final functional groups, filled by many fractional dioxide of silicon are considered as criteria of optimization. Influence of the limiting volume filling on energy of mechanical destruction was investigated. The elastomeric material is offered for use as a covering of asphalt highways {{in the form of a}} <b>frost-proof</b> waterproofing layer, which allowing multiply to increase operating properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work: {{studying}} the induced mutation process of the cross-pollution plants in the nearest and remote populations from the mutagenous action. The data about the value, character of action and methods of regulation of the mutation variation pool in the panmictic populations have been received. Shown has been the specificity of action of the mutagenous agents {{on the base of}} reaction of the cells and tissues on the physiological loads. Obtained and subjected to the state sort-test has been the meadow fescue "Onezhskaya"; subjected to the preliminary tests have been five lines of the different character of growth, rroductive and <b>frost-proof</b> onesAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: the winter soft and durum wheat, the winter barley. The purpose of investigation: the {{systemic}} {{investigation of the}} winter cultures frost-proofness, using the physico-chemical parameters of plants {{and the development of}} the physiological bases of these cultures frost-proofness increase by selection, creation of methods of the frost-proofness mass evaluation. Performed have been the direct frozing of the plants in the refregerating chambers, the registration of the thermograms of after-luminescence and fluorescence, the record of the electric parameters by the automated systems, spectrophotometry and multidimensional statistic computer processing. For the first time, theoretically and experimentally justified has been the conception of the adaptive character component structure, the approach to the quantitative design of the expressivity of the individual components of the definite genotypes has been shown. The quantitative variations {{of the structure of the}} frost-proofness sign have been revealed in the course of vegetation and in the process of selection. Improved have been the known methods and developed the new methods of selection of the <b>frost-proof</b> genotypes, the equipment for the mass record of the physico-chemical parameters of the selection material has been created, the bases for the selection strategy for the frost-proofness have been formulated. The conception of the component structure of the adaptive sign will allow to increase the efficiency of the selection process due to the right selection of donors of the adaptive properties and the effective express-methods of selection of the stable genotypesAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
