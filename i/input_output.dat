2500|$|Frequency domain – In {{this type}} {{the values of}} the state variables, the {{mathematical}} variables representing the system's <b>input,</b> <b>output</b> and feedback are represented as functions of frequency. [...] The input signal and the system's transfer function are converted from time functions to functions of frequency by a transform such as the Fourier transform, Laplace transform, or Z transform. [...] The advantage of this technique is that it results in a simplification of the mathematics; the differential equations that represent the system are replaced by algebraic equations in the frequency domain which is much simpler to solve. [...] However, frequency domain techniques can only be used with linear systems, as mentioned above.|$|E
2500|$|If {{predictable}} {{operation is}} desired, negative feedback is used, by applying {{a portion of}} the output voltage to the inverting input. The closed-loop feedback greatly reduces the gain of the circuit. [...] When negative feedback is used, the circuit's overall gain and response becomes determined mostly by the feedback network, rather than by the op-amp characteristics. If the feedback network is made of components with values small relative to the op amp's input impedance, the value of the op-amp's open-loop response AOL does not seriously affect the circuit's performance. The response of the op-amp circuit with its <b>input,</b> <b>output,</b> and feedback circuits to an input is characterized mathematically by a transfer function; designing an op-amp circuit to have a desired transfer function is in the realm of electrical engineering. [...] The transfer functions are important in most applications of op-amps, such as in analog computers. High input impedance at the input terminals and low output impedance at the output terminal(s) are particularly useful features of an op-amp.|$|E

2500|$|Speech sounds can be imitatively mapped into vocal articulations {{in spite}} of vocal tract anatomy {{differences}} in size and shape due to gender, age and individual anatomical variability. Such variability is extensive making <b>input</b> <b>output</b> mapping of speech more complex than a simple mapping of vocal track movements. The shape of the mouth varies widely: dentists recognize three basic shapes of palate: trapezoid, ovoid, and triagonal; six types of malocclusion between the two jaws; nine ways teeth relate to the dental arch and {{a wide range of}} maxillary and mandible deformities. [...] Vocal sound can also vary due to dental injury and dental caries. Other factors that do not impede [...] the sensory motor mapping needed for vocal imitation [...] are gross oral deformations such as hare-lips, cleft palates or amputations of the tongue tip, pipe smoking, pencil biting and teeth clinching (such as in ventriloquism).

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the frequency domain analysis of the classical control theory, modern control theory utilizes the time-domain state space representation, a mathematical model of a physical system {{as a set of}} <b>input,</b> <b>output</b> and state variables related by first-order differential equations. To abstract from the number of inputs, outputs, and states, the variables are expressed as vectors and the differential and algebraic equations are written in matrix form (the latter only being possible when the dynamical system is linear). The state space representation (also known as the [...] "time-domain approach") provides a convenient and compact way to model and analyze systems with multiple inputs and outputs. With inputs and outputs, we would otherwise have to write down Laplace transforms to encode all the information about a system. Unlike the frequency domain approach, the use of the state-space representation is not limited to systems with linear components and zero initial conditions. [...] "State space" [...] refers to the space whose axes are the state variables. The state of the system can be represented as a point within that space.|$|E
