5|$|A {{classification}} of <b>hepatic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> was introduced at the World Congress of Gastroenterology 1998 in Vienna. According to this classification, <b>hepatic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> is subdivided in type A, B and C {{depending on the}} underlying cause.|$|E
5|$|In {{those with}} cirrhosis, {{the risk of}} {{developing}} <b>hepatic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> is 20% per year, and at any time about 30–45% of people with cirrhosis exhibit evidence of overt encephalopathy. The prevalence of minimal <b>hepatic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> detectable on formal neuropsychological testing is 60–80%; this increases the likelihood of developing overt encephalopathy in the future. Once <b>hepatic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> has developed, the prognosis is determined largely by other markers of liver failure, such as the levels of albumin (a protein produced by the liver), the prothrombin time (a test of coagulation, which relies on proteins produced in the liver), the presence of ascites and the level of bilirubin (a breakdown product of hemoglobin which is conjugated and excreted by the liver). Together with the severity of encephalopathy, these markers have been incorporated into the Child-Pugh score; this score determines the one- and two-year survival and may assist in a decision to offer liver transplantation.|$|E
5|$|The mildest form of <b>hepatic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> is {{difficult}} to detect clinically, but may be demonstrated on neuropsychological testing. It is experienced as forgetfulness, mild confusion, and irritability. The first stage of <b>hepatic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> is characterised by an inverted sleep-wake pattern (sleeping by day, being awake at night). The second stage is marked by lethargy and personality changes. The third stage is marked by worsened confusion. The fourth stage {{is marked by a}} progression to coma.|$|E

40|$|AIM: Acquired hepatocerebral {{degeneration}} (AHD) is {{an exceptional}} type of <b>hepatic</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> (HE). It {{is characterized by}} neuropsychiatric and extrapyramidal symptomathology similar to that seen in hepatolenticular degeneration (Wilson’s disease). In this paper, we report a case of AHD with unusual presenting features. METHODS: A 28 -year-old man with AHD was described and the literature was reviewed. RESULTS: The man {{had a history of}} HBV-related liver cirrhosis. He was admitted to our hospital with apathy, dysarthria, mild consciousness impairment and extrapyramidal symptoms after hematemesis.

5|$|Other liver-related {{complications}} (portal hypertension, esophageal varices, ascites, <b>hepatic</b> <b>encephalopathy)</b> {{are treated}} with the same modalities as used in cirrhosis, although the use of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt treatment is discouraged {{due to the lack}} of documented benefit.|$|E
5|$|The {{severity}} of <b>hepatic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> is graded with the West Haven Criteria; this {{is based on}} the level of impairment of autonomy, changes in consciousness, intellectual function, behavior, and the dependence on therapy.|$|E
5|$|The {{treatment}} of <b>hepatic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> {{depends on the}} suspected underlying cause (types A, B or C) and {{the presence or absence}} of underlying causes. If encephalopathy develops in acute liver failure (type A), even in a mild form (grade 1–2), it indicates that a liver transplant may be required, and transfer to a specialist centre is advised. <b>Hepatic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> type B may arise in those who have undergone a TIPS procedure; in most cases this resolves spontaneously or with the medical treatments discussed below, but in a small proportion of about5%, occlusion of the shunt is required to address the symptoms.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} hypocapnic-hyperventilation on {{cerebral}} blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate for oxgen (CMRO 2) were evaluted in 7 patients with <b>hepatic</b> or septec <b>encephalopathy.</b> A positive linear relationship between CBF and PaCO 2 was observed in hepatic patients (CBF= 3. 12 PaCO 2 - 81. 4,r= 0. 739) and in septic patients (CBF= 1. 96 PaCO 2 - 36. 1, r= 0. 535). Although these regression equations were not statistically {{different from that of}} awake patients (CBF= 0. 87 PaCO 2 + 12. 0,r= 0. 866),　a tendency to augment the cerebrovas cular reactivity to CO 2 was observed in patients with <b>hepatic</b> or septec <b>encephalopathy.</b> Therefore, hypocapnic- hyperventilation produced a reduction in CBF below the level required to meet the demand in 4 of 7 patients. As an index of cerebral ischemia, the ratio of CBF to CMRO 2 was examined in the same patients during alteration of PaCO 2. A good limer correlation was observed between CBF/CMRO 2 and juglar venous PO 2 (JPvO 2) (CBF/CMRO 2 = 0. 97 JPvO 2 - 15, 4, r= 0. 917). It is concluded that cerebrovascular reactivity to CO 2 was preserved in patients with <b>hepatic</b> and septic <b>encephalopathy,</b> therefore, intentional or inadvertent hyperventilation may produce cerebral ischemia in these patients.

5|$|<b>Hepatic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> (HE) is {{an altered}} level of {{consciousness}} {{as a result}} of liver failure. Onset may be gradual or sudden. Other symptoms may include movement problems, changes in mood, or changes in personality. In the advanced stages it can result in a coma.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hepatic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> is {{possibly}} reversible with treatment. This typically involves supportive care and addressing the triggers of the event. Lactulose is frequently used to decrease ammonia levels. Certain antibiotics and probiotics are other potential options. A liver transplant may improve outcomes {{in those with}} severe disease.|$|E
5|$|In a small {{proportion}} of cases, the encephalopathy is caused directly by liver failure; this is more likely in acute liver failure.

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of <b>hepatic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> {{can only be}} made in the presence of confirmed liver disease (types A and C) or a portosystemic shunt (type B), as its symptoms are similar to those encountered in other encephalopathies. To make the distinction, abnormal liver function tests and/or ultrasound suggesting liver disease are required, and ideally liver biopsy. The symptoms of <b>hepatic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> may also arise from other conditions, such as cerebral haemorrhage and seizures (both of which are more common in chronic liver disease). A CT scan of the brain may be required to exclude haemorrhage, and if seizure activity is suspected an electroencephalograph (EEG) study may be performed. Rarer mimics of encephalopathy are meningitis, encephalitis, Wernicke's encephalopathy and Wilson's disease; these may be suspected on clinical grounds and confirmed with investigations.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{numerous}} studies demonstrating {{the central role}} of ammonia, ammonia levels do not always correlate with the severity of the encephalopathy; it is suspected that this means that more ammonia has already been absorbed into the brain in those with severe symptoms whose serum levels are relatively low. Other waste products implicated in <b>hepatic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> include mercaptans (substances containing a thiol group), short-chain fatty acids, and phenol.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hepatic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> {{may also}} occur after the {{creation}} of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). This is used in the treatment of refractory ascites, bleeding from oesophageal varices and hepatorenal syndrome. TIPS-related encephalopathy occurs in about 30% of cases, with the risk being higher in those with previous episodes of encephalopathy, higher age, female sex and liver disease due to causes other than alcohol.|$|E

It {{was found to be}} prolonged in dementia, renal, and <b>hepatic</b> <b>encephalopathies,</b> but was not extensively assessed in respiratory failure. Objective: To evaluate P 300 changes in patients with respiratory failure, and especially those with mild or subclinical hypoxic&ndash;hypercapnic encephalopathy. Methods: Auditory event-related evoked potential P 300 latency was measured using an oddball paradigm in patients with respiratory failure due to any cause (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PO 2) should be 75 mm/Hg or less). Apart from blood gases measurement, patients underwent the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Patient performances were compared with that of matched normal control. Patients were admitted into the study from outpatient clinics and wards at King Khalid University Hospital and Sahara Hospital. Results: Thirty-four patients (12 women, 22 men) were admitted to the study. Ages ranged from 19 &ndash; 67 years with a mean of 46. 1 years. Respiratory failure was severe or very severe in 11 patients (33 %), and mild or moderate in the rest (66 %). Mean value for PO 2 and partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PCO 2) were 63. 7 and 45. 2 mm/Hg, respectively. pH mean was 7. 4 and O 2 saturation was 90. 7 %. P 300 latency ranged from 218 to 393 milliseconds, with a mean of 338. 4 milliseconds. In comparison with control (309. 9 milliseconds), {{there was a significant difference}} (P = 0. 007). P 300 amplitude differences were not significant. No significant difference in MMSE was noted between mild and severe respiratory failure. Results of detailed neuropsychological assessment were clearly abnormal but were limited by the small number of tested patients. P 300 latency changes correlated significantly with age as well as severity of respiratory failure. P 300 was also significantly delayed whether hypoxia occurred with or without hypercapnia. Conclusion: Results show a significant delay of P 300 latency in patients with severe and mild respiratory failure. This was associated with subclinical encephalopathy in most patients, evidenced by a near-normal MMSE score. Apart from confirming the importance of P 300 latency measurement as a marker of respiratory encephalopathy, this study asserts the causal relationship between hypoxemia and cognitive derangement. Furthermore, it promotes the early use of oxygen therapy in a selected group of patients with mild or moderate respiratory failure, who have responsibilities which involve taking rapid critical decisions.

5|$|In the past, it {{was thought}} that {{consumption}} of protein even at normal levels increased the risk of <b>hepatic</b> <b>encephalopathy.</b> This {{has been shown to be}} incorrect.

5|$|More than 40% {{of people}} with {{cirrhosis}} develop <b>hepatic</b> <b>encephalopathy.</b> More {{than half of those}} with cirrhosis and significant HE live less than a year.

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of <b>hepatic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> is a clinical one, once other causes for confusion or coma have been excluded; no test fully diagnoses or excludes it. Serum ammonia levels are elevated in 90% of people, {{but not all}} hyperammonaemia (high ammonia levels) is associated with encephalopathy. A CT scan of the brain usually shows no abnormality except in stage IV encephalopathy, when cerebral oedema may be visible. Other neuroimaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are not currently regarded as useful, although they may show abnormalities. Electroencephalography shows no clear abnormalities in stage 0, even if minimal HE is present; in stages I, II and III there are triphasic waves over the frontal lobes that oscillate at 5Hz, and in stage IV there is slow delta wave activity. However, the changes in EEG are not typical enough to be useful in distinguishing <b>hepatic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> from other conditions.|$|E
30|$|Apart from pancreatitis, {{coagulopathy}} {{and bone}} marrow suppression, <b>hepatic</b> toxicity and <b>encephalopathy</b> are rare but long known adverse events of valproate therapy independent of patient’s age (Gerstner et al. 2008).

Mental retardation, carnitine deficiency and urea cycle defects increase its risk (Chopra et al. 2012). Patients develop both transaminase elevation and isolated hyperammonemia without transaminase elevation with valproate-induced encephalopathy (Amanat et al. 2013; Verrotti et al. 2002).

40|$|International audiencePurpose: The goal of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} clinical and imaging ă variables that are associated with an unfavorable outcome during the 30 ă days following transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) ă placement. ă Material and methods: Fifty-four consecutive patients with liver ă cirrhosis (Child-Pugh 6 - 13, Model for End-stage Liver Disease 7 - 26) ă underwent TIPS placement for refractory ascites (n = 25), recurrent or ă uncontrolled variceal bleeding (n = 23) or both (n = 6). Clinical, ă biological and imaging variables including type of stent (covered n = ă 40; bare-stent n = 14), presence of spontaneous portosystemic shunt (n = ă 31), and variations in portosystemic pressure gradient were recorded. ă Early severe complication was defined as the occurrence of overt <b>hepatic</b> ă <b>encephalopathy</b> or death within the 30 days following TIPS placement. ă Results: Sixteen patients (30 %) presented with early severe ă complication after TIPS placement.

5|$|About 5% of {{all people}} are {{diagnosed}} only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often {{in the context of}} a hemolytic anemia (anemia due to the destruction of red blood cells). This leads to abnormalities in protein production (identified by deranged coagulation) and metabolism by the liver. The deranged protein metabolism leads to the accumulation of waste products such as ammonia in the bloodstream. When these irritate the brain, the person develops <b>hepatic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> (confusion, coma, seizures and finally life-threatening swelling of the brain).|$|E
5|$|<b>Hepatic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> {{can occur}} in those with acute or chronic liver disease. Episodes can be {{triggered}} by infections, GI bleeding, constipation, electrolyte problems, or certain medications. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve the build up of ammonia in the blood, a substance that is normally removed by the liver. The diagnosis is typically made after ruling out other potential causes. It may be supported by blood ammonia levels, an electroencephalogram, or a CT scan of the brain.|$|E
5|$|In acute liver failure, the {{development}} of severe encephalopathy strongly predicts short-term mortality, and is almost {{as important as the}} nature of the underlying cause of the liver failure in determining the prognosis. Historically, widely used criteria for offering liver transplantation, such as King's College Criteria, are of limited use and recent guidelines discourage excessive reliance on these criteria.

40|$|BackgroundHepatic {{encephalopathy}} is neuropsychiatric derangement {{secondary to}} hepatic decompensation or portal-systemic shunting. Nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibition aggravates encephalopathy and increases mortality in rats with thioacetamide (TAA) -induced acute liver failure, suggesting a protective role of NO. This {{study investigated the}} roles of endothelium-derived constitutive NO synthase (eNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS) in the liver of rats with fulminant <b>hepatic</b> failure and <b>encephalopathy.</b> MethodsMale Sprague-Dawley rats (300 - 350 g) were randomized to receive TAA 350 mg/kg/day, by intraperitoneal injection or normal saline for 3 days. Severity of encephalopathy was assessed with the Opto-Varimex animal activity meter. Plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin were measured. Hepatic iNOS and eNOS RNA and protein expressions were assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses, respectively. ResultsThe TAA group showed lower motor activity counts than the normal saline group. Hepatic eNOS, but not iNOS, mRNA and protein expressions were enhanced in the TAA group. In addition, hepatic eNOS mRNA expression was negatively correlated with total movement but positively correlated with ALT and AST. Protein expression of hepatic eNOS {{was positively correlated with}} ALT, AST and bilirubin.

40|$|The {{origin of}} an {{intrahepatic}} portosystemic venous shunt {{can be either}} spontaneous or acquired and is caused by liver injury or portal hypertension. The term “congenital shunt” may be more suitable than “spontaneous shunt” in the precise description {{of the origin of}} the shunt detected soon after birth, {{in which there is no}} evidence of hepatic injury. Patients with intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunts are at risk of <b>hepatic</b> or portosystemic <b>encephalopathy.</b> B-mode real-time sonography is usually the first modality to suspect the presence of an intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunt. However, the suspicion depends on the examiner's awareness of the disease and the size of the shunt. Small shunts may be undetected by B-mode real-time sonography. Doppler sonography, contrast-enhanced computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiography can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Among these techniques, Doppler sonography is most convenient and noninvasive. The cost of a Doppler examination is also the lowest. This modality may allow calculation of the shunting blood flow. Patients with a shunt ratio exceeding 60 % of the total portal blood flow are at high risk of encephalopathy. Small shunts may be missed by Doppler sonography, because small shunting blood flow may be lower than the detection range of the machine. The advantages and the limitations of sonography for the diagnosis of intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunt are discussed in this review...|$|R
