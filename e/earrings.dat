5|$|Among the Tlingit of the Pacific Northwest of America, <b>earrings</b> were {{a sign of}} nobility and wealth, as the {{placement}} of each earring on a child had to be purchased at an expensive potlatch. <b>Earrings</b> were common in the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt (1550–1292 BCE), generally taking {{the form of a}} dangling, gold hoop. Gem-studded, golden <b>earrings</b> shaped like asps seem to have been reserved for nobility. The ancient Greeks wore paste pendant <b>earrings</b> shaped like sacred birds or demigods, while the women of ancient Rome wore precious gemstones in their ears.|$|E
5|$|As {{well as the}} {{chandelier}} <b>earrings,</b> and 60 other pieces of jewellery, Mrs Greville left the Queen Mother a set of pear-drop <b>earrings</b> that she had bought from Cartier in 1938. The pear-shaped drop diamonds each weigh about 20carats (4g). Diana, Princess of Wales, borrowed them in 1983 to wear on her first official visit to Australia. At a state banquet, she wore the <b>earrings</b> with a tiara from her family's own collection. The Greville Pear-drop <b>Earrings</b> passed to the Queen upon her mother's death in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Ear {{piercing}} {{has been}} practiced {{all over the}} world since ancient times. There is considerable written and archaeological evidence of the practice. Mummified bodies with pierced ears have been discovered, including the oldest mummified body discovered to date, the 5,300-year-old Ötzi the Iceman, which was found in a glacier in Italy. This mummy had an ear piercing 7–11mm diameter. The oldest <b>earrings</b> found in a grave date to 2500 BCE. These were located in the Sumerian city of Ur, home of the Biblical patriarch Abraham. <b>Earrings</b> are mentioned in the Bible. In Genesis 35:4, Jacob buries the <b>earrings</b> worn by members of his household along with their idols. In Exodus 32, Aaron makes the golden calf from melted <b>earrings.</b> Deuteronomy 15:12–17 dictates ear piercing for a slave who chooses not to be freed. <b>Earrings</b> are also referenced in connection to the Hindu goddess Lakshmi in the Vedas. <b>Earrings</b> for pierced ears were found in a grave in the Ukok region between Russia and China dated between 400 and 300 BCE.|$|E

5|$|Uttanka {{wanted to}} give the sage his gurudakshina. The guru told him to meet his wife Ahalya and inquire as to her wish. Ahalya {{suggested}} that he bring her the divine <b>earrings</b> of Madayanti, King Mitrasaha Saudasa's wife, as gurudakshina. The king had turned into a cannibalistic rakshasa by a curse and was known as Kalmashapada. Uttanka met Kalmashapada, who approached Uttanka to eat him, but Uttanka stopped him and explained that he was duty-bound to get Madayanti's <b>earrings</b> as gurudakshina and that he, Uttanka, would return to Kalmashapada after fulfilling his obligation. Kalmashapada agreed and directed him to his wife, who refused to part with her <b>earrings</b> until Uttanka brought some token from Kalmashapada as proof of his consent. Upon returning from Kalmashapada with a token, Madayanti gave him the <b>earrings.</b> The queen warned Uttanka that her <b>earrings</b> were coveted by Nagas, Yakshas, rakshasas and the gods, who would try to steal them. Uttanka was therefore advised not to allow the <b>earrings</b> to touch the ground to prevent the snakes from taking possession of them.|$|E
5|$|The Mahabharata also records an {{encounter}} between the sage Uttanka and Kalmashapada. After serving his guru Gautama {{for a hundred}} years, Uttanka is allowed to go, but must provide Gautama with Gurudakshina, a traditional repayment for his teacher's services. Gautama's wife Ahalya suggests that he bring her the divine <b>earrings</b> of Madayanti, Kalmashapada's wife, as repayment. Uttanka meets the cannibalistic Kalmashapada, who approaches Uttanka to eat him, but Uttanka stops him and explains that he is duty-bound to get Madayanti's <b>earrings</b> as gurudakshina and that he, Uttanka, will return to Kalmashapada after fulfilling his obligation. Kalmashapada agrees and directs him to his wife, who refuses to part with her <b>earrings</b> until Uttanka brings some token from Kalmashapada as proof of his consent. Upon returning from Kalmashapada with a token, Madayanti gives him the <b>earrings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like the Coronation Necklace, these <b>earrings</b> {{have been}} worn by queens regnant and consort at every {{coronation}} since 1901. Made for Queen Victoria in 1858 using the diamonds {{from an old}} Garter badge, they are of typical design: a large brilliant followed by a smaller one, with a large pear-shaped drop. The drops were originally part of the Koh-i-Noor armlet. After they had been made, Victoria wore the <b>earrings</b> and matching necklace in the painting Queen Victoria by the European court painter, Franz Winterhalter.|$|E

50|$|In early 2010, Miccoli made {{national}} news after he purchased an <b>earring</b> belonging to his childhood hero Diego Maradona. The <b>earring</b> had been confiscated {{by the national}} tax office during a visit by Maradona to Italy (the Argentine star owing several million euros in taxes to the Italian state). It was sold at a public auction for €25,000. After confirming the purchase, Miccoli revealed he would return the <b>earring</b> to Maradona {{if he were to}} meet him.|$|R
50|$|The Hawaiian <b>earring</b> {{can also}} be used to {{construct}} a semi-locally simply connected space that is not locally simply connected. In particular, the cone on the Hawaiian <b>earring</b> is contractible and therefore semi-locally simply connected, but it is clearly not locally simply connected.|$|R

5|$|These 7.5cm (3in) long {{chandelier}} <b>earrings</b> made by Cartier in 1929 {{have three}} large drops adorned with every modern cut of diamond. The <b>earrings</b> were purchased by Margaret Greville, who left {{them to her}} friend the Queen Mother in 1942, and Elizabeth's parents gave them to her in 1947 as a wedding present. However, she {{was not able to}} use them until she had her ears pierced. When the public noticed that her ears had been pierced, doctors and jewellers found themselves inundated with requests by women anxious to have their ears pierced too.|$|E

50|$|The {{painting}} is a tronie, the Dutch 17th-century {{description of a}} 'head' that {{was not meant to}} be a portrait. It depicts a European girl wearing an exotic dress, an oriental turban, and an improbably large pearl <b>earring.</b> In 2014, Dutch astrophysicist Vincent Icke raised doubts about the material of the <b>earring</b> and argued that it looks more like polished tin than pearl {{on the grounds of the}} specular reflection, the pear shape and the large size of the <b>earring.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{circle is}} an example of a locally simply {{connected}} space which is not simply connected.

5|$|According to 2006's Tattoos and Body Piercing, {{corporate}} dress codes {{can also}} strictly limit piercing displays.

5|$|The Muisca {{society was}} in essence egalitarian with slight {{differences}} {{in terms of}} use of jewelry.
