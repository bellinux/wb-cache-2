25|$|Sir, I {{have the}} honor of informing you that I have arrived in this port with a {{commission}} from the Supreme Government of the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata to take possession of these islands {{on behalf of the}} country to which they belong by Natural Law. While carrying out this mission I want to do so with all the courtesy and respect all friendly nations; one of the objectives of my mission is to prevent the destruction of resources necessary for all ships passing by and forced to cast anchor here, as well as to help them to obtain the necessary supplies, with minimum expenses and inconvenience. Since your presence here is not in competition with these purposes and in the belief that a personal meeting will be fruitful <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> I invite you to come aboard, where you'll be welcomed to stay as long as you wish; I would also greatly appreciate your extending this invitation to any other British subject found in the vicinity; I am, respectfully yours. Signed, Jewett, Colonel of the Navy of the United Provinces of South America and commander of the frigate Heroína.|$|E
500|$|An {{enduring}} friendship {{featured in}} EastEnders {{was the one}} shared between the characters Dot Cotton and Ethel Skinner (played by Gretchen Franklin), first shown on-screen in 1985 and ending with Ethel's death in 2000, though the characters shared a backstory set prior to 1985 and were scripted as neighbours who grew old together in East London, along with Lou Beale (Anna Wing). BBC News has described Dot and Ethel as an [...] "incomparable double-act [...] Occasionally spiky and often hilarious". Dot and Ethel shared few similarities in personality. During an episode that aired in 2008, just under 8 years after Ethel died in the serial, Dot discussed the differences between them: [...] "Ethel was a free spirit, not like me. All bottled up. I remember sitting on the step of the Vic, waiting for me mother. I {{caught a glimpse of}} her through the door. Sitting on top of the piano, her legs spread, showing next week's washing and bawling out [...] "Roll Out the Barrel". Just like a navvy. She didn't seem to have a care in the world. I had enough <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> I loved Ethel." [...] Critic for The Guardian, Nancy Banks-Smith, discussed the characters' relationship in 2008, comparing them to the girls written about by Dylan Thomas: [...] "There was always one pretty and pert , and always one in glasses [...]" [...] Banks-Smith adds that theirs was [...] "a symbiotic relationship in which the pretty one looks even prettier by contrast and the plain one is popular by proxy. Which is not to say it is not a real and enduring friendship." ...|$|E

2500|$|This rivality [...] {{was really}} {{building}} {{from the people}} of the newspapers and the fans. But I think it was very good <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> because the publicity was so big and it created a very big interest about me and Maria and was very good in the end. But I don't know why they put this kind of rivality , because the voice was very different. She was really something unusual. And I remember that I was very young artist too, and I stayed near the radio every time that I know that there was something on radio by Maria.|$|E
2500|$|On September 25, 2013, Voltaire {{announced}} on his official blog, {{that he and}} his wife were to be divorced. Saying, quote, [...] "On October 1st of this year, my wife and I would be celebrating our 4th year wedding anniversary. Unfortunately, it's not to be. After nearly four years of marriage and a couple more of dating, we are parting ways. It saddens me so deeply that things didn't work out. It's been a difficult process <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> to come to this decision, one that I really don't wish upon anyone.

There’s no judgment like that at all, but I think the way…some of the needs we have for the way we need to do the work is a little different.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1965–66 {{season and}} after England's victory in the 1966 World Cup Final, during which he played, Alan Ball was sold to Everton for £112,000, Blackpool's record {{transfer}} fee receipt at that point, and so started a trend that would become increasingly familiar. Prior to his departure, Ball, along with Jimmy Armfield, was honoured by Blackpool's mayor councillor, Robert Brierley, JP, in a civic reception at Town Hall. Armfield stated: [...] "It is a great privilege to be so honoured by the town and something I have hitherto only dreamed of. As far as the World Cup is concerned, it was a disappointment to me that I didn't get a game. But Blackpool Football Club's colours were kept flying <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> by Alan, particularly in the Final." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 21 August 1892, Henry Labouchère {{published}} {{an article in the}} investigative journal, Truth, exposing the Society as a fraud. The Hon. Secretary of the Society, Dr Edward Albert Sturman, M.A., F.R.S.L. had been following the example of a 20-year contemporaneous swindling operation entitled the International Society of Literature, Science and Art, known as the International, a hollow money-making venture in which the novelist Sir Gilbert Campbell was used as bait. William James Morgan, William Tolmie and others were tried and imprisoned for deception and fraud. The International and the SSLA were not rivals: while his swindle was still functioning Tomie has written to Sturman in friendship, saying, [...] "There is plenty of room <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> and though we work on somewhat similar lines, they need not be opposing ones." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 9, 2012, it was {{announced}} that Odom had parted ways with the Mavericks. Instead of releasing him, the team listed Odom inactive {{for the remainder of the}} season.

In a statement to ESPN, Odom said, [...] "I'm sorry that things didn't work out better <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> but I wish the Mavs' organization, my teammates and Dallas fans nothing but continued success in the defense of their championship." [...] Mavericks owner Mark Cuban admitted that a clash between the two during halftime in a game against the Memphis Grizzlies on April 7 was the last straw. Odom reportedly responded angrily when Cuban questioned his commitment, asking if he was [...] "in or out." [...] Odom averaged only 6.6 points in 20.5 minutes along with career lows in shooting percentage (35.2), rebounds (4.2) and assists (1.7) [...]|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the start}} of {{training}} camp, Ljungberg {{was nowhere to be}} seen. Many speculated a transfer was in the works despite Elefalk's claims that Ljungberg was to return. Days later, Ljungberg agreed to terminate his contract only after one year into the four-year deal for a sum of £6 million. Ljungberg stated afterward, [...] "I gave my all at West Ham and enjoyed my time there but the decision is the best <b>for</b> the <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> Now, I will take my time to consider my football future." ...|$|R

At the beginning of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Molly clashes with Bill's fiancée, Fleur Delacour; however, {{at the end of the}} novel, when Molly rushes to Hogwarts with her husband and Fleur to tend to her son Bill, who had been ferociously attacked by Fenrir Greyback, Fleur is greatly offended when Molly jumps to the conclusion she will break up with Bill due to his scarring, letting her know in no uncertain terms that as far as she is concerned, she is [...] "good-looking enough <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> I theenk! All these scars show is zat my husband is brave!" [...] Fleur and Molly unexpectedly hug and begin to see each other in a much more positive light.|$|E
2500|$|Rogers was {{outstanding}} among Astaire's partners {{not because}} she was superior to others as a dancer, but because, as a skilled, intuitive actress, she was cagey {{enough to realize that}} acting did not stop when dancing began... the reason so many women have fantasized about dancing with Fred Astaire is that Ginger Rogers conveyed the impression that dancing with him is the most thrilling experience imaginable.According to Astaire, [...] "Ginger had never danced with a partner before Flying Down to Rio. She faked it an awful lot. She couldn't tap and she couldn't do this and that... but Ginger had style and talent and improved as she went along. She got so that after a while everyone else who danced with me looked wrong." [...] In his book Ginger: Salute to a Star author Dick Richards quotes Astaire saying to Raymond Rohauer, curator of the New York Gallery of Modern Art, [...] "Ginger was brilliantly effective. She made everything work for her. Actually she made things very fine <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> and she deserves most of the credit for our success." [...] When asked who his favorite dancing partner was by British TV interviewer Michael Parkinson on Parkinson in 1976, Astaire said [...] "Excuse me, I must say Ginger was certainly the one. You know, the most effective partner I had. Everyone knows. That was a whole other thing what we did...I just want to pay a tribute to Ginger because we did so many pictures together and believe me it was a value to have that girl...she had it! She was just great!" ...|$|E

I met him {{swinging}} across the springy sod in long elastic strides, {{but there was nothing}} about him which suggested one preyed upon by morbid fancies or the visionary. His eyes were a little heavy, but that was all, <b>for</b> with <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> the dreams <b>of</b> the night had melted before the rising sun. The air had been freshened by the dew, and the breeze, which dried the grasses, roused one to a sense of human necessities and the knowledge that there was a day's work to be done. I was also conscious of an unfanciful and very prosaic emptiness.|$|R

It's probably really corny to call it [...] "honest" [...] but that's exactly what it is. We're always learning about ourselves, the world we live in, and life in general and this EP captures where we are, and who we are as people at this time and it's exactly how we want it. I definitely speak <b>for</b> the <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> when I say we haven't been more excited or proud of anything in our entire lives.” The EP's lead single was, [...] "Jealousy." ...|$|R

Bill is attacked by werewolf Fenrir Greyback and severely mauled {{near the end}} of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower. However, since Greyback is in his human form {{at the time of the}} attack, Bill suffers only partial lycanthropic contamination. Molly Weasley, who largely disapproves of Fleur, assumes that she will no longer wish to marry Bill, but Fleur is adamant that their wedding plans go unchanged and proudly declares Bill's wounds to be a sign of bravery, adding, [...] "I am good looking enough <b>for</b> the <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> anyway". Her fierce, loving loyalty to her fiancé earns her much respect from most of Bill's erstwhile disapproving family, especially Molly, who is finally forced to admit that their love is genuine.|$|R
