5|$|In 1960, Szilard was {{diagnosed}} with bladder cancer. He underwent cobalt therapy at New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital using a cobalt 60 treatment regimen that he designed himself. A second round of treatment with an increased dose followed in 1962. The doctors tried {{to tell him that}} the increased radiation dose would kill him, but <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> wouldn't, and that anyway he would die without it. The higher dose did its job and his cancer never returned. This treatment became standard for many cancers and is still used.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, after Waterloo {{station was}} chosen as the British {{terminus}} for the Eurostar train service, Florent Longuepée, a municipal councillor in Paris, wrote to the British Prime Minister requesting that the station be renamed because <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was upsetting for the French to be reminded of Napoleon's defeat when they arrived in London by Eurostar. There is a name counterpart in Paris: the Gare d'Austerlitz is named after the Battle of Austerlitz, one of Napoleon's greatest victories (over the Russians and Austrians).|$|E
5|$|In the United States, Ohno is {{credited}} with popularizing and being {{the face of his}} sport. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> is amazing being a role model to younger skaters. Growing up, he did not have that influence within his sport, but looked up to other athletes outside his sport, such as Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, and Lance Armstrong. Training for short track has been the main focus of Ohno's life, but {{he has been able to}} work on other endeavors. He studied business at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs.|$|E

It aimed to encourage wellness and modernization of treatment. Biden stated it would cost between $80billion and $110billion per year. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> could have been paid with a rollback of tax cuts of the richest 1% bracket, capital gains and dividends and the elimination of tax loopholes for hedge fund managers and private equity partners. The plan would also had increased the SCHIP program to include children 300% above the poverty level.|$|E

5|$|Augie March {{returned}} to the studio in 2004 to record a follow-up to Strange Bird. The band worked with two producers, Paul McKercher and Eric Drew Feldman, and recorded in Melbourne, San Francisco, and their own studio in Nagambie, Victoria. Donovan said it was more suited to the band's style; as they co-produced on all their albums, they took {{a great deal of}} interest in production. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> also enabled them to work at their own pace, hence the four-year gap between releases. They released a DVD, Drones & Vapid Ditties, containing live performances and music videos, in mid-2004. The band's upcoming album, according to Triple J, was inspired by the streets of Melbourne. Upon completion of the initial recording sessions of Moo, You Bloody Choir, there was a six-month delay before release, as Augie March meticulously added finishing touches to it. In March 2006, the album was finally released.|$|E
5|$|In the Northern Ireland Trophy (a ranking {{event in}} this season), he lost 4–5 to Lee in the quarter-finals, {{and in the}} UK Championship, he lost 3–9 to Alan McManus in the second round. A 3–6 defeat by Stephen Hendry in the quarter-finals of the Masters was {{followed}} by his second ranking title, when he defeated Ryan Day 9–4 in {{the final of the}} Malta Cup. After the victory, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was a relief {{to get rid of the}} one-hit wonder label. In his next match, a victory over Jamie Cope in the Welsh Open, he scored centuries in four consecutive frames, becoming only the second player to do this (after Higgins in the 2005 Grand Prix final) and the only person to do so in a best-of-nine match. He went on to lose 3–5 to Maguire in the quarter-finals. In the World Championship, Murphy defeated Stevens 13–12 in the quarter-finals—recovering from 5–11 down and knocking the latter out of the top 16—before losing 16–17 against Mark Selby in the semi-finals.|$|E
5|$|On 5 July 1943, Model led the {{northern}} assault on Kursk during Operation Citadel, a plan which had caused great controversy within the German high command. Günther von Kluge and Erich von Manstein, commanding Army Groups Centre and South respectively, had originally urged that the salient be attacked in May, before the Soviets could prepare their defences. Others, including Heinz Guderian, felt that attacking was unnecessary, {{since it would}} occasion heavy tank losses and thus upset plans for increasing German armored strength. Model was also skeptical of the plan's chances, pointing out that Konstantin Rokossovsky's Central Front was strongly dug in and outnumbered him two to one in men, tanks and artillery. Rather than conclude that the offensive be called off, however, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> should be postponed until he could receive further reinforcements, in particular the new Panther tanks and Ferdinand tank destroyers.|$|E

5|$|The {{scene with}} Peter in the hypnotherapist's office was censored from television, as Peter {{discusses}} his genitals and reproductive organs. When Peter {{comes to the}} realization that Francis is not his real father and when Stewie dreams about being tortured by Lois, a harp sound can be heard; MacFarlane comments that even small things like that take {{a lot of work to}} produce. The alcohol bottles being pushed by the airplane that Peter and Brian are traveling on were animated by computer, as is the taxi driving along the street. On the DVD commentary, MacFarlane notes that the scene would not have looked good without computer aid. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> makes the animations seem more realistic than without a computer. The two men circling each other for fifty years and waiting for the other to throw the first punch was not broadcast for television.|$|E
5|$|Uematsu {{was born}} in Kōchi, Kōchi Prefecture, Japan. A self-taught musician, he began {{to play the piano}} when he was between the ages of eleven and twelve years old, and he did not take any formal piano lessons. He has an older sister who also played the piano. After graduating from Kanagawa University with a degree in English, Uematsu played the {{keyboard}} in several amateur bands and composed music for television commercials. When Uematsu was working at a music rental shop in Tokyo, a Square employee asked if he would be interested in creating music for some of the titles they were working on. Although he agreed, Uematsu at the time considered it a side job, and he did not think it would become a full-time career. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was a way to make some money on the side, while also keeping his part-time job at the music rental shop.|$|E
5|$|Benfica began December {{hoping to}} extend their {{domestic}} winning streak, and the club's first game hosted Vitória de Setúbal on 1 December. Laionel opened the score for Setúbal in the 35th minute, with Benfica only responding {{in the second half}} with Kostas Katsouranis. In the 59th minute, David Suazo fired a powerful shot that beat Pedro Alves and put Benfica in the lead. However, in the 91st minute, a bicycle kick by Anderson do Ó cleared Quim and levelled the game. Although Sánchez Flores called the equaliser an accident, he soon dropped Quim in favour of José Moreira. A week later, Benfica visited the Estádio dos Barreiros to play Marítimo. They had their best performance of the season, winning 6–0 with Suazo and Nuno Gomes each scoring twice. The win put Benfica {{at the top of the}} table for the first time since May 2005, and was their largest away win since 1974. On 13 December, Benfica played Leixões for a place in the Portuguese Cup quarter-finals. On a rainy night at Estádio do Mar, neither team could find the back of the net in regular and extra time. Reyes missed a penalty, giving Leixões the win. Although Nuno Gomes was frustrated with the elimination, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was time to hold their heads high and win the league. On Thursday the 18th, Benfica closed their European campaign by hosting Metalist Kharkiv. To qualify, Benfica had to win 8–0 and Olympiacos not win; in case of a draw, Benfica needed a better goal average. They lost one-nil, finishing last in Group B. Sánchez Flores assumed full responsibility for his team's performance in the competition. Of 40 teams, only Partizan, Heerenveen and Feyenoord played worse than Benfica. The year ended with a home game against Nacional. Benfica never overcame Nacional goalkeeper Rafael Bracalli, wasting an opportunity to open a four-point lead in the league table. The match ended in controversy after Cardozo had a goal disallowed because Miguel Vítor had deflected the ball with his hands. According to Sánchez Flores, the goal was legitimate and Benfica were deprived of three points.|$|E

5|$|Development of the {{sandwich}} began in 2001 {{in response to}} several major factors. After an overall sales decline of 17% coupled with a profit decline of 29%, Burger King {{held a series of}} consumer tests that showed the company's customer base was looking for a wider variety of options when making purchases. Additional survey results revealed that a lack of newer products was discouraging consumers from visiting the chain. Furthermore, the company was seeking to counter the threat to its sales by newer fast casual restaurants that had begun to bite into sales. By July 2002, the chain had sold nearly fifty million of {{the sandwich}}es, eventually displacing the BK Broiler's initial launch figures as the company's best selling product introduction. The successful introduction of the Chicken Whopper {{was one of the few}} noted positive highlights of the company during negotiations for the sale of Burger King by its then owner Diageo to a group of investors led by the TPG Capital; Chicago-based consulting firm Technomic Inc. President Ron Paul was quoted that he was encouraged by recent product changes at Burger King such as the new Chicken Whopper, but <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was too early to tell whether the changes have been successful. Despite the Chicken Whopper's initial success, just over a year after the its introduction, enthusiasm for the product was waning; Burger King's largest franchisee, Carrols Corporation, was complaining that the product line was a failure, describing the sandwich as a pedestrian product with a great name.|$|E
