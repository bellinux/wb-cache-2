50|$|France still retains this system, {{a recent}} law {{making it an}} {{obligation}} for every town {{to have at least}} 20% HLM. Nowadays HLM represents roughly half of the rental market (46% in 2006). Social housing is not all for disadvantaged people who are just one of the target groups. Part of the funding can be provided by employer-employee groups to provide housing for local employees. The 20% target can include <b>intermediate</b> <b>housing</b> for better off groups, although its object is to produce social mix. Gentrification and the very basis of social housing allocation are divisive issues as well as the extent of local control of housing. This housing has always been a multi-actor activity and recent local government reorganization continues to change the political landscape.|$|E

40|$|The {{movement}} {{away from}} traditional rented approaches to meeting the housing needs of those on modest incomes has taken on new momentum in the latest economic cycle. This book answers {{some of the questions}} around affordable housing and low cost home ownership, and whether these intermediate tenures have the potential to play a longer term role in achieving sustainable housing markets. The editors clarify the principles on which the development of affordable housing and intermediate tenures has been based; analyse the policy instruments used to implement these ideas; and make a preliminary assessment of their longer tem value to households and governments alike. Making Housing More Affordable: the role of intermediate tenures brings together an evidence base for researchers and policy makers as they assess past experience and work to understand future options. The book draws mainly on experience of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>housing</b> market in England but also on examples of policies that have been implemented across the world. It clarifies both the challenges and the achievements of governments in providing a well operating intermediate market that can help meet the fundamental goal of 'a decent home for every household at a price within their means'. The first section outlines the principles and practice of <b>intermediate</b> <b>housing</b> and examines the instruments and mechanisms by which it has been provided internationally. The next section estimates who might benefit from being in <b>intermediate</b> <b>housing</b> and projects the take-up of different products in the future. Section III examines the supply side and Section IV introduces some case studies of who gets what. The final section looks at how effectively the intermediate market operates over the economic cycle...|$|E

40|$|International audienceEuropean public {{policies}} {{face the challenge}} of well ageing. A key element of my research is the role given to older people in the conception of new types of housing and living arrangements. Among the various types of <b>intermediate</b> <b>housing</b> models, from nursing homes to in-house support, the self-managed co-housing scheme seems a good solution from an economic point of view: it allows a reduction in the public expenditure necessitated by the demands of an ageing population, not to mention social costs. It improves the quality of elderly people’s lives by focusing on personal autonomy and communal solidarity. This article gives an overview of scientific literature on the subject of “co-housing and ageing” and describes some results of five field studies recently conducted in intergenerational co-housing projects in Germany, Sweden and England...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstract: Non-dependent {{elderly people}} take the {{decision}} to move into <b>intermediate</b> <b>housing</b> for the elderly (residential homes, retirement homes and villages, shared housing, intergenerational housing, etc.). Studies {{have shown that the}} reasons driving individuals’ decisions to move are based on facts affecting their current situation. Above all, these include moving to be closer to family and friends, to feel less isolated, to feel safer by being in housing that is better adapted to their needs and/or providing possibilities of personal care and support, and to a lesser extent, to be in a pleasant environment. The aim {{of this article is to}} show that the decision is based on life-span factors. Biographical accounts of people living in this type of housing reveal that their decision was influenced by their social trajectory. It appears that {{the decision to}} move close to family and friends varies according to the importance played in the past by family activities in relation to other socially significant activities (professional and community activities, etc.).

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess new and often {{innovative}} models that aim to fund and deliver affordable housing in Scotland within a context of fiscal crisis. These models and their setting have implications for other countries with limited funds to support their housing systems. Design/methodology/approach – This paper is a policy analysis, drawing on ideas from public policy and applied economics. It derives a set of criteria with which to provide an interim assessment of both key proposals and the policy programme as a whole. Findings – The new models and the government's approach are pragmatic and have elements of genuine innovation. Other elements are only aspirations at this point and considerable uncertainties remain. The new environment will be difficult for housing associations but also in terms of wider knock-on effects between the market-rented sector and <b>intermediate</b> <b>housing.</b> Major concerns remain about rent levels and there is a lack of clarity about government's long-term objectives for social housing. Originality/value – The paper provides a first critical overview and initial assessment of radical new policies for affordable housing in Scotland. The paper's subject matter is of direct relevance to all national housing systems confronting shortages of public resources, a demonstrable need for more affordable housing, and also those contemplating radical reform to tried and tested funding and delivery models. </p...|$|E
50|$|Construction work on {{the houses}} in Norfolk Crescent (at the time still known as Norfolk Place) began in 1792 when {{builders}} first took leases on the various plots. However the building work soon stopped due to the financial crisis. When construction work started again in the 19th century the market was much slower and the houses were completed gradually, when there was money available. For instance in 1817 Nos. 1-9, No. 14 and Nos. 16-18 were complete, but the <b>intermediate</b> <b>houses</b> were still not finished. No. 11, the last house to be completed, was finished in 1822.|$|R

40|$|Government {{policies}} have backed <b>intermediate</b> <b>housing</b> market mechanisms like shared equity, intermediate rented and shared ownership (SO) as potential routes for some households, who are otherwise squeezed between the social housing {{and the private}} market. The rhetoric deployed around such housing has regularly contained claims about its social progressiveness and role in facilitating socio-economic mobility, centring on a claim that SO schemes can encourage people to move from rented accommodation through a shared equity phase and into full owner-occupation. SO has been justified {{on the grounds of}} it being transitional state, rather than a permanent tenure. However SO buyers may be laden with economic cost-benefit structures that do not stack up evenly and as a consequence there may be little realistic prospect of ever reaching a preferred outcome. Such behaviours have received little empirical attention as yet despite, the SO model arguably offers a sub-optimal solution towards homeownership, or in terms of wider quality of life. Given the paucity of rigorous empirical work on this issue, this paper delineates the evidence so far and sets out a research agenda. Our analysis is based on a large dataset of new shared owners, observing an information base that spans the past decade. We then set out an agenda to further examine the behaviours of the SO occupants and to examine the implications for future public policy based on existing literature and our outline findings. This paper is particularly opportune at a time of economic uncertainty and an overriding ‘austerity’ drive in public funding in the UK, through which SO schemes have enjoyed support uninterruptedly thus far...|$|E
40|$|DE 19833064 A UPAB: 20000320 NOVELTY - A {{high output}} voltage planar fuel cell, in which {{electrolyte}} membranes (20) cover cell interconnection structures in interspaces (Z) between individual cells. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A high output voltage fuel cell comprises a flat arrangement {{of at least}} two individual cells having an electrolyte membrane (20) coated with anode and cathode electrodes (21). The membranes (20) of adjacent cells extend into the interspace (Z) between individual cells where they overlap one another and tightly cover each side of the cell interconnection structure (22) which is impermeable to fuel in its plane within the interspace. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a fuel cell battery comprising a stack of the above planar fuel cells separated by <b>intermediate</b> <b>housing</b> plates, the first and last planar fuel cells being closed by housing end plates. Preferred Features: The cell housing (24) contacts both membranes (20) under pressure within the interspace (Z), a seal (23) being positioned between the housing and each membrane. The interconnection structure (22) comprises flat foils or perforated and/or expanded sheets, especially of special steel or titanium, or woven fabric, paper or fleece of carbon and/or metal. The electrolyte membrane (20) consists of a cation exchange membrane which is resistant to hydrolysis, oxidation and hydrogen or methanol. An electrically nonconductive foil may be located between the interconnection structure (22) and each membrane (20) within the interspace and the interconnection structure may be coated with an inert material, especially a polymer, within the interspace. USE - As a high output voltage fuel cell useful for small electrical equipment such as portable computers. ADVANTAGE - The fuel cell has a very compact, modular, planar construction and ensures a gas-tight electrical connection between the anode and cathode sides of the individual cells...|$|E
