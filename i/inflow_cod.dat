40|$|INTRODUCTION Constructed {{wetlands}} (CWs) {{are typically}} designed assuming idealized steady-state influent loads. However, CWs might face sporadic periods of overloading during their lifespan, {{due to an}} increase either in the volume of wastewater to treat or in the pollutant concentrations in wastewater (or both). Although this technology {{is well known for}} its buffering capacity, the mechanisms behind it are not well understood. In this study we aim to improve the understanding of the internal processes that make horizontal flow constructed wetlands (HF CWs) able to cope with sudden contaminant and/or hydraulic overloads, and also to investigate if and how sustained overloading affects the long-term performance of these systems. METHODS In this study, we employ the BIO_PORE model (Samsó and García, 2013 a), which simulates the hydraulics (Darcian flow), biochemistry (CWM 1 biokinetic model, Langergraber et al., 2009), plant effects (nutrient uptake and oxygen release) and the interactions between bacteria and accumulated solids in HF CWs. The effect of organic overloads is studied using the same HF CW configuration and influent pollutant loads as those considered by Samsó and García (2013 b) (10. 3 m long and 5. 3 m wide CW - COD and TN effluent concentrations validated by Samsó and García (2013 a)). The final state of the simulation carried out by Samsó and García (2013 b), which corresponds {{to the end of the}} 3 rd year of operation of the wetland, is used as initial condition of the simulations developed in this work, which are one year long and reproduce the functioning of the HF CW subject to overloads. These overloads are simulated by increasing <b>inflow</b> <b>COD</b> concentrations, hydraulic loads, or both at the same time. For the increases in organic loads, three overloading scenarios are tested: + 10 %, + 30 % and + 50 % of influent COD concentration while keeping influent N-NH 4 concentrations constant. Additionally, the effect of the HRT is tested by comparing simulations with + 30 % increase in the organic load, + 30 % increase in the hydraulic load, and combined + 15 % increase in both hydraulic and organic loads. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Both the increase in influent COD concentration and different HRT promote a change in bacterial community distribution, which exhibits the same zonation shown by Samsó and García (2013 b), but with differences in the relative amount of biomass of each bacterial group with respect to the total biomass. Comparison of simulations with similar total biomass reveals how variations in COD removal efficiency for different hydraulic and organic loads are controlled by changes in HRTs and influent concentrations, respectively. Increasing influent COD concentrations stimulates bacterial growth, with total biomass (TB) that tends be more abundant and to occupy more CW space towards the CW outlet (Figure 1, top). Moreover, the portion of TB near the inlet shifts towards the outlet as well due to the higher inert material that is accumulated near the inlet (Figure 1, bottom). HF CW shows a good buffer capacity for organic overloads, with COD removal efficiencies even higher at the end of the simulated year compared to the beginning of the simulation (not shown). However, the response time is long due to the low growth rate of anaerobic bacteria. This results in a long transition phase (almost six months) in which COD removal efficiency is lower (from 91. 3 % at normal loadings to 80 % for + 50 % organic overloading) (not shown). Additionally, feeding HF CW with higher organic loads reduces their lifespan due to higher accumulation of inert material (Figure 1). COD removal efficiencies are also influenced by HRT. COD removal efficiency is higher in the first four months when only hydraulic loads are increased, while higher concentrations promote a higher removal efficiency in the last 8 months of the simulation.

40|$|Despite {{the global}} {{acceptance}} {{for the application}} of vertical-flow constructed wetlands (VF CWs) as sustainable and cost-efficient technology in treating various types of wastewater, including urban wastewater, continuous loading of wetlands over time can lead to performance inefficiency and generate operational problems especially when high shock loads, such as petroleum hydrocarbon spills, are subjected to the system. Contamination with petroleum hydrocarbon compounds results in changing the structure, function and ecosystem service values of wetlands, which can eventually lead to clogging of the wetland substrate and affect the life time of the system. Sound knowledge of long-term performance in mature vertical-flow constructed wetlands linked with hydrocarbon treatment processes is needed to make guided judgments about the probable effects of a given suite of impacts and revise the management plans accordingly. A study was conducted to compare the impact of different design (aggregate size) and operational (contact time, rest time and chemical oxygen demand (COD) loading) variables on the long-term and seasonal performance of vertical-flow constructed wetland filters operated in tidal flow between June 2011 and March 2016. Ten different vertical-flow wetland systems were planted with Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. (Common Reed). Approximately 130 and 975 grams of diesel fuel (equivalent to 20 and 150 grams/litre, respectively) were each poured into four wetland filters on 26 / 09 / 2013 and 26 / 09 / 2014 respectively. Overall findings showed that the mature wetland system improved the water quality except for ortho-phosphate-phosphorus (PO₄-P), which reduced less over time. Findings also indicated that the wetland filter with the highest chemical oxygen demand (COD) loading but no diesel contamination performed the best in terms of COD and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) removal. Filters contaminated by diesel performed worse in terms of COD and BOD but considerably better regarding nitrate-nitrogen removal. The removal efficiencies dropped for those filters impacted by the diesel spills. Seasonal analysis for water quality from different wetlands showed clear seasonal outflow concentration trends (low in summer) for COD, and nitrate-nitrogen (NO₃-N) while effluent BOD showed high treatment performance in winter. No clear seasonal trend for ammonia-nitrogen (NH₄-N), PO₄-P or suspended solids (SS) was noted. Serious clogging phenomena, impacting negatively on the treatment performance and the hydraulic conductivity, were not observed. The simulation model confirms the experimental findings that notable wetland clogging restricting the operation did not occur. Moreover, results showed that small aggregate diameter, low <b>inflow</b> <b>COD</b> load, and high contact and rest time were most efficient in reducing SS accumulation within the wetland filter bed. With regard to the treatment performance of the hydrocarbon contaminants, results indicated that all wetland systems had a relatively good performance in treating petroleum hydrocarbon compounds and the evaluation showed that all the hydrocarbon components were highly degraded and their concentrations were reduced in all treated effluents of wetland filters with time. This indicates that VF CW zones provide appropriate conditions for high treatment capacity of diesel compounds spilled with urban wastewater by a combination of processes taking place in the wetland filters, thus minimizing hydrocarbon compounds within the filter. A new experimental artificial ponds system, including: ponds with wastewater; ponds with wastewater and reeds; and ponds with wastewater, reeds and aeration, was operated in parallel with the mature experimental vertical-flow constructed wetland system, for the period between July 2015 and October 2015, to compare performance, design and operation variables between the two treatment technologies in the treatment of urban wastewater. Findings showed that highest COD and SS removals were observed for wetlands in comparison to ponds. Moreover, mature wetlands were better in removing NH₄-N and PO₄-P than ponds unless the ponds were aerated. Both systems were linked with medium to high levels of BOD removal. The aerated pond system demonstrated better treatment performance in terms of NH₄-N and PO₄-P. The NO₃-N concentration increased in the aerated ponds reflecting the high oxygen availability. Due to increasing water scarcity and droughts, which are key concerns worldwide, there is considerable interest in recycling various wastewater streams, such as treated urban wastewater, for irrigation in the agricultural sector. Recycling of effluents from various wetland filters (with/without diesel contamination) was assessed for the irrigation of chilli plants (De Cayenne; Capsicum annuum (Linnaeus) Longum Group ‘De Cayenne’) grown in a greenhouse environment. Concerning chilli fruit numbers, findings showed that the highest fruit yields for all wetland filters were associated with those that received inflow wastewater with a high loading rate, reflecting the high nutrient availability in treated wastewater, which is of obvious importance for yield production. Findings also indicated that wetlands without hydrocarbon contamination, with small aggregate size, low contact time, and low inflow loading rate provided high marketable yields (expressed in economic return). In comparison, chillies irrigated by filters with hydrocarbon contamination, small aggregate size, high contact time and high loading rate also resulted in high marketable yields of chillies, which pointed out the role of high contact time and high inflow load for better diesel degradation rates. The overall outcome of this research could considerably contribute to optimization of the design and development of long-term operation variables for constructed wetland technology particularly in petroleum industry applications. Statistically validated long-term data interpretation can particularly help the wetland modelling community and wetland managers to define, with insight into long-term and seasonal factors, removal processes for individual water quality parameters to maximize wetlands treatment performance...|$|E
40|$|In theory, {{biological}} and physical clogging, induced {{as a result}} of potentially excessive formation of biomass from degradation of pollutants and retention of inert suspended fine particles, respectively, should result in a decrease of treatment performance. However, some wetlands are not prone to clogging in practice. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the impact of different design (aggregate size) and operational (contact time, empty time and chemical oxygen demand [COD] loading) variables on the treatment efficiency and clogging processes. Different vertical-flow constructed wetlands were constructed and operated from June 2011 until June 2012. Data from June 2011 (setting-up period) were not used. The filter with the highest COD loading performed the worst in terms of outflow COD concentration (120 mg/l) but best in terms of COD load reduction (61 %). The wetland with the largest aggregate size had the lowest mean nitrate-nitrogen outflow concentration of 1. 2 mg/l. However, the results were similar regardless of aggregate size (10 versus 20 mm) and resting time (24 versus 48 h) for most water quality variables. However, different <b>COD</b> <b>inflow</b> concentrations (<b>COD</b> of 146 mg/l versus COD of 312 mg/l) had a significant (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) impact on the treatment performance for COD, ammonia-nitrogen, ortho-phosphate-phosphorus and suspended solids (SS).

40|$|Although {{horizontal}} flow constructed wetlands (HF CWs) {{are usually}} subjected to unsteady loads in real application, the modelling of HF CW response to time-variable loads has been scarcely studied in literature yet.

30|$|Due to the {{presence}} of too much synthetic dye in the industrial wastewater treatment systems, the influent of the 3 full-scale WWTPs in Shaoxing and Shangyu WWTP usually contained a certain amount of sulfide and refractory organic pollutants. The specific organic pollutant in Shaoxing WWTP is reported as terephthalic acid (Yi et al. 2015), dyeing aids (e.g., anhydrous sodium sulfate), and acids (e.g., sulfuric acid) (Robinson et al. 2001). Comparatively, the performance of Qige WWTP had the best performance in COD, BOD and nitrogen removal which was ascribed to the better biodegradable in <b>inflow.</b> The highest <b>COD</b> removal rate was achieved in Qige-WWTP (average 91.1 %), where the effluent consistently met the national Grade 1 -B standard. The COD removal rate of Shangyu WWTP was the lowest (less than 77 %). The T-N removal rate for industrial wastewater treatment system (Shaoxing and Shangyu WWTPs) was not higher than 50 %, of which SX-II (OD) had the lowest T-N removal rate (average 34 %). However, a highly stable NH 3 –N removal rate was demonstrated in all WWTPs. The detailed performance data for the summer is shown in Table  1.|$|R

40|$|Despite their global {{acceptance}} as {{a sustainable}} and cost-efficient technology for water pollution control including urban wastewater contaminated with hydrocarbons, treatment performance of vertical-flow constructed wetlands can be hampered by clogging of the substrate media pores of the wetland filters. This clogging usually leads to blockage of filter substrate, progressive diminution of porosity and reduction of active pore volume, permeability and substrate hydraulic conductivity subsequently leading to poor water quality production by the wetland filters. This operational problem hinders the wider application and acceptability {{of these systems}} worldwide. In this study, different laboratory-scale vertical-flow constructed wetlands filled with gravel and planted with common reed were constructed and operated between June 2011 and March 2014 to assess treatment performances and their relationship with clogging, and diesel spill treatment {{as a function of}} hydraulic and organic loading rates, media size, and contact and rest time. Furthermore, to evaluate the hydrocarbon spill, approximately 130 grams of diesel fuel was poured into each of four wetland filters. This is the equivalent of a one-off inflow concentration of 20 g/l. A range of hydraulic loading rates was applied across the systems using real urban wastewater. Analysis of total petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations of outflow waters along with other water quality parameters was carried out to monitor both clogging and treatment performance variations. Overall, all constructed wetland systems have shown relatively high removal efficiencies for the key water quality parameters regardless of filter set-up before the hydrocarbon spill and no clogging observed. The removal efficiencies dropped for those filters impacted by the diesel spill. The filter with the highest COD loading but no diesel contamination performed the best in terms of COD and BOD removal. Furthermore, filters contaminated by diesel performed worse in terms of COD and BOD, but considerably better regarding nitrate-nitrogen removal without any apparent negative impact of within bed clogging Pertaining to seasonal variability, findings show that COD, nitrate-nitrogen and ammonia-nitrogen have shown a seasonal trend with high removal in summer compared to other seasons, while BOD removal was efficient in winter compared to summer and turbidity was greatly removed in autumn compared to other seasons. However, no clear seasonal pattern of ortho-phosphate-phosphorus and SS removal were noted. Furthermore, in the hydrocarbon contamination period, all filters regardless of the pollution, design or operation had higher removal in winter than autumn for COD, BOD, ammonia-nitrogen and ortho-phosphate-phosphorus while no seasonal trend was observed for other water quality parameters. Investigation regarding treatment performance and clogging evolution revealed that none of the systems has shown any signs of clogging after about three years of operation even with high rate Filters 7 and 8. The simulation model confirms the empirical findings that considerable filter clogging restricting the operation has not occurred. However, a small aggregate diameter, a short contact time, a long resting time and a low <b>COD</b> <b>inflow</b> concentration were most beneficial in reducing SS accumulation within the wetland filters.
