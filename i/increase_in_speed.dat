5|$|Python's {{developers}} {{strive to}} avoid premature optimization, and moreover, reject patches to non-critical parts of CPython that would offer a marginal <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>speed</b> {{at the cost}} of clarity. When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or try using PyPy, a just-in-time compiler. Cython is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{realizes that}} Crump is in a {{considerable}} amount of pain and {{that the only way to}} ease the pain is to drive west. At first, Scully believes that Crump is suffering from some sort of biological contagion, but after investigating the Crumps' home, she discovers a U.S. Navy antenna array emitting ELF waves stretches beneath their property. Scully deduces that an abnormal surge in these waves somehow caused a rising pressure in the inner ear of the nearby inhabitants. Westward motion and an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>speed</b> seems to be the only thing to help ease the pain of the increasing pressure.|$|E
5|$|The Kolberg class {{represented}} {{the first major}} improvement in combat power for German light cruisers, both qualitatively and quantitatively. They were armed with the longer-barrel 10.5 cm SK L/45 gun, which had a higher muzzle velocity and thus greater range than the earlier L/40 weapon. In addition, they carried an extra pair of guns, which strengthened their broadside. This was on a displacement of over a thousand tons greater than the preceding Dresden class. All four ships were also powered by turbines, which granted them a significant <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>speed</b> over the earlier vessels.|$|E

25|$|In the end, most {{airlines}} favored lower {{operating costs}} over a marginal <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>speed,</b> {{and the project}} did not attract the interest for which Boeing had been hoping. The Sonic Cruiser project was finally abandoned by December 2002 {{in favor of the}} slower but more fuel-efficient 7E7 (later renamed Boeing 787 Dreamliner). Much of the research from the Sonic Cruiser was applied to the 787, including carbon fiber reinforced plastic for the fuselage and wings, bleedless engines, cockpit and avionics design.|$|E
25|$|During the IndyCar Series season, however, Johnny Rutherford is {{the normal}} {{driver of the}} IRL pace car for all events. The pace car is {{deployed}} for debris, collision, or weather reasons. Since 1993, upon the waving of the yellow flag, pit road is closed until the pace car picks up the leader and passes the pit entrance the first time, unless track blockage forces the field to drive through pit lane. Another duty of the pace car is to lead the field around the course on parade laps {{prior to the start}} of the race. These <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>speed,</b> allowing for a flying start of the race.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} the {{accident}} was the failure in flight of the starboard outer wing in upward bending due to tensile overloading of the lower spar boom at station 323, probably induced {{by a combination of}} manoeuvre and gust loading when the speed of the aircraft was in excess of 260 knots. The circumstances and available evidence carry a strong implication that the in-flight structural failure was preceded by a loss of control with a consequential <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>speed</b> to at least 260 knots. The most probable explanation for the loss of control is that the aircraft entered an area of unexpected turbulence of such severity as to deprive the pilots of full recovery.|$|E

50|$|As {{the wind}} <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>speed</b> and shifts forward (because of the {{acceleration}} of the boat), the sails have to be trimmed {{in order to maintain}} performance.

25|$|For years, {{processor}} makers delivered {{increases in}} clock rates and instruction-level parallelism, so that single-threaded code executed faster on newer processors with no modification. Now, to manage CPU power dissipation, processor makers favor multi-core chip designs, and software {{has to be}} written in a multi-threaded manner {{to take full advantage}} of the hardware. Many multi-threaded development paradigms introduce overhead, and will not see a linear <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>speed</b> vs number of processors. This is particularly true while accessing shared or dependent resources, due to lock contention. This effect becomes more noticeable as the number of processors increases. There are cases where a roughly 45% increase in processor transistors has translated to roughly 10â€“20% increase in processing power.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of planets {{orbiting}} a star, {{the mass of the}} star and all its satellites are calculated to be at a single point called the barycenter. The paths of all the star's satellites are elliptical orbits about that barycenter. Each satellite in that system will have its own elliptical orbit with the barycenter at one focal point of that ellipse. At any point along its orbit, any satellite will have a certain value of kinetic and potential energy with respect to the barycenter, and that energy is a constant value at every point along its orbit. As a result, as a planet approaches periapsis, the planet will <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>speed</b> as its potential energy decreases; as a planet approaches apoapsis, its velocity will decrease as its potential energy increases.|$|E
25|$|This {{corresponds}} to the kinetic energy the expelled reaction mass would have at a speed equal to the exhaust speed. If the reaction mass had to be accelerated from zero speed to the exhaust speed, all energy produced {{would go into the}} reaction mass and nothing would be left for kinetic energy gain by the rocket and payload. However, if the rocket already moves and accelerates (the reaction mass is expelled in the direction opposite to the direction in which the rocket moves) less kinetic energy is added to the reaction mass. To see this, if, for example, =10km/s and the speed of the rocket is 3km/s, then the speed of a small amount of expended reaction mass changes from 3km/s forwards to 7km/s rearwards. Thus, although the energy required is 50 MJ per kg reaction mass, only 20 MJ is used for the <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>speed</b> of the reaction mass. The remaining 30 MJ is the increase of the kinetic energy of the rocket and payload.|$|E
50|$|Altitude {{training}} can produce <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>speed,</b> strength, endurance, and recovery by maintaining altitude exposure {{for a significant}} period of time.

25|$|As flight speed {{increases}} supersonically {{the shock}} system is initially external. For the SR-71 this was until about M1.6 to M1.8 and M2 for the XB-70. The intake {{is said to}} be unstarted. Further <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>speed</b> produces supersonic speeds inside the duct with a plane shock near the throat. The intake {{is said to be}} started. Upstream or downstream disturbances, such as gusts/atmospheric temperature gradients and engine airflow changes, both intentional and unintentional(from surging), tend to cause the shock to be expelled almost instantaneously. Expulsion of the shock, known as an unstart, causes all the supersonic compression to take place externally through a single plane shock. The intake has changed in a split second from its most efficient configuration with most of its supersonic compression taking place inside the duct to the least efficient as shown by the large loss in pressure recovery, from about 80% to about 20% at M3 flight speeds. There is a large drop in intake pressure and loss in thrust together with temporary loss of control of the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The Luftwaffes Messerschmitt Bf 109E and Bf 110C {{fought against}} the RAF's {{workhorse}} Hurricane Mk I and the less numerous Spitfire Mk I; Hurricanes outnumbered Spitfires in RAF Fighter Command by about 2:1 when war broke out. The Bf 109E had a better climb rate and was up to 40mph faster in level flight than the Rotol (constant speed propellor) equipped Hurricane Mk I, depending on altitude. The speed and climb disparity with the original non-Rotol Hurricane was even greater. By the end of spring 1940, all RAF Spitfire and Hurricane fighter squadrons converted to 100 octane aviation fuel, which allowed their Merlin engines to generate significantly more power and an approximately 30mph <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>speed</b> at low altitudes {{through the use of}} an Emergency Boost Override. In September 1940, the more powerful Mk IIa series 1 Hurricanes started entering service in small numbers. This version was capable of a maximum speed of , some 20mph more than the original (non-Rotol) Mk I, though it was still 15 to 20mph slower than a Bf 109 (depending on altitude).|$|E

40|$|The {{simulated}} annealing approach to structure solution from powder diffraction data, as {{implemented in the}} DASH program, is easily amenable to parallelization at the individual run level.

25|$|The {{effect of}} the {{combustion}} of propellant in the rocket engine {{is to increase the}} velocity of the resulting gases to very high speeds, hence producing a thrust. Initially, the gases of combustion are sent in every direction, but only those that produce a net thrust have any effect. The ideal direction of motion of the exhaust is in the direction so as to cause thrust. At the top end of the combustion chamber the hot, energetic gas fluid cannot move forward, and so, it pushes upward against the top of the rocket engine's combustion chamber. As the combustion gases approach the exit of the combustion chamber, they <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>speed.</b> The {{effect of the}} convergent part of the rocket engine nozzle on the high pressure fluid of combustion gases, is to cause the gases to accelerate to high speed. The higher the speed of the gases, the lower the pressure of the gas (Bernoulli's principle or conservation of energy) acting on that part of the combustion chamber. In a properly designed engine, the flow will reach Mach 1 at the throat of the nozzle. At which point the speed of the flow increases. Beyond the throat of the nozzle, a bell shaped expansion part of the engine allows the gases that are expanding to push against that part of the rocket engine. Thus, the bell part of the nozzle gives additional thrust. Simply expressed, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, according to Newton's third law with the result that the exiting gases produce the reaction of a force on the rocket causing it to accelerate the rocket.|$|E
