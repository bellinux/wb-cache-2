50|$|Slewing drives {{function}} with standard worm technology, {{in which the}} worm on the horizontal shaft acts as the driver for the gear. The rotation of the horizontal screw turns a gear about an axis perpendicular to the screw axis. This combination reduces {{the speed of the}} <b>driven</b> <b>member</b> and also multiplies its torque; increasing it proportionally as the speed decreases. The speed ratio of shafts depends upon the relation of the number of threads on the worm to the number of teeth in the worm wheel or gear.|$|E

50|$|Cars use {{clutches}} {{in places}} {{other than the}} drive train. For example, a belt-driven engine cooling fan may have a heat-activated clutch. The driving and driven members are separated by a silicone-based fluid and a valve controlled by a bimetallic spring. When the temperature is low, the spring winds and closes the valve, which lets the fan spin at about 20% to 30% of the shaft speed. As {{the temperature of the}} spring rises, it unwinds and opens the valve, allowing fluid past the valve, makes the fan spin at about 60% to 90% of shaft speed. Other clutches—such as for an air conditioning compressor—electronically engage clutches using magnetic force to couple the driving member to the <b>driven</b> <b>member.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1928, Frederick G. Creed {{developed}} a single-turn spring clutch (see above) that was particularly {{well suited to}} the repetitive start-stop action required in teleprinters. [...] In 1942, two employees of Pitney Bowes Postage Meter Company {{developed a}}n improved single turn spring clutch. [...] In these clutches, a coil spring is wrapped around the driven shaft and held in an expanded configuration by the trip lever. When tripped, the spring rapidly contracts around the power shaft engaging the clutch. At {{the end of one}} revolution, if the trip lever has been reset, it catches the end of the spring (or a pawl attached to it) and the angular momentum of the <b>driven</b> <b>member</b> releases the tension on the spring. These clutches have long operating lives, many have cycled for tens and perhaps hundreds of millions of cycles without need of maintenance other than occasional lubrication.|$|E
40|$|A {{system for}} {{coupling}} two bodies together and for transmitting torque from one body to another with mechanical timing and sequencing is reported. The mechanical timing and sequencing is handled {{so that the}} following criteria are met: (1) the bodies are handled in a safe manner and nothing floats loose in space, (2) electrical connectors are engaged {{as long as possible}} so that the internal processes can be monitored throughout by sensors, and (3) electrical and mechanical power and signals are coupled. The first body has a splined driver for providing the input torque. The second body has a threaded <b>drive</b> <b>member</b> capable of rotation and limited translation. The embedded <b>drive</b> <b>member</b> will mate with and fasten to the splined driver. The second body has an embedded bevel gear member capable of rotation and limited translation. This bevel gear member is coaxial with the threaded <b>drive</b> <b>member.</b> A compression spring provides a preload on the rotating threaded member, and a thrust bearing is used for limiting the translation of the bevel gear member so that when the bevel gear member reaches the upward limit of its translation the two bodies are fully coupled and the bevel gear member then rotates due to the input torque transmitted from the splined driver through the threaded <b>drive</b> <b>member</b> to the bevel gear member. An output bevel gear with an attached output drive shaft is embedded in the second body and meshes with the threaded rotating bevel gear member to transmit the input torque to the output drive shaft...|$|R

5000|$|Cone: Cone loading {{is more or}} less {{always used}} with sprung mechanisms. The {{combination}} of these 2 permits a less rigid fixing of the <b>driven</b> <b>member,</b> permitting more movement. The cone is also better able to handle lower frequencies compared to a table-top sized horn. Consequently these speakers have better bass response than small horn speakers. Spring force restrains the moving iron. The downside of greater movement is greater non-linearity, thus higher distortion. Paper cone loaded moving iron speakers were in use pre-war. These suffered some noticeable issues: The magnetic gap was usually manually adjustable to give good sensitivity at any given output volume. Misadjustment was thus common. The iron sometimes stuck to the magnet if overdriven or misadjusted. The result was a loud 'whack' followed by near silence. Loud bass notes caused end-stopping. Unlike modern speakers, which are designed to produce soft end-stopping, the iron in these hitting the pole piece made a noisy resonant chattering sound.|$|E

Fatigue of flexible riser has attracted widely attention since Oliveira et al. put forward to estimate flexible pipe life cycle for the first time[1], now many scholars have studied it[2 - 4].

Prescribed timing of the linkage 2 ̆ 7 s <b>driven</b> <b>member,</b> the crank, is included to ensure no less than 180 ∘ of angular output. Additionally, equations of static equilibrium and virtual work expressions are implemented to ensure a consistent sense of output torque on the linkages driven member; this assures that the direction of motion of the mechanism does not change before acquiring 180 ∘ of angular displacement. The methods used to achieve the optimization include a gradient method, the generalized reduced gradient method, and two evolutionary programming models that use combinatorial optimization, simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. Hybridization of these methodologies also produce optimal mechanisms. Numerous examples are included that demonstrate the efficacy of the various methods...|$|E
40|$|This {{invention}} comprises a {{torque drive}} mechanism utilizing axially translatable, mutually engageable transmission members having mating crown gears, driven and driving members with a three-element drive train being biased together by resilient means or by a fluid actuator system, the apparatus being operable to transmit a precisely controlled degree of torque to a <b>driven</b> <b>member.</b> The apparatus is applicable {{for use in}} hand tools and {{as a replacement for}} impact torque drivers, torque wrenches, motorized screw drivers, or the like, wherein the applied torque must be precisely controlled or limited. The bevel torque drive includes a drive gear which is axially displaceable and rotatable within cylindrical driver housing, a rotatable intermediate gear, and an output gear. Key rotationally secures displaceable gear with respect to input shaft but permits axial movement therebetween. A thrust bearing is preferably connected to the lower end of shaft for support to reduce play and friction between shaft and a transmission joint disc during rotation of the gear train. Coaxially mounted coiled spring is footed against displaceable gear for biasing the displaceable gear toward and into engagement with the intermediate gear for driving intermediate gear and output gear. Torque control is achieved by the use of straight or spiral beveled gears which are of configurations adapted to withdraw from mutual engagement upon the torque exceeding a predetermined limit. The novel, advantageous features of the invention include the configuration of the mating, crown gear sets and the axially translatable, slidable drive gear. The mechanism is capable of transmitting a high degree of torque within a narrow, compact transmission housing. The compact size and narrow, elongated configuration of the housing is particularly applicable for use in hand tools and in multiple torque driver mechanisms in which it is necessary to drive multiple fasteners which are located in close proximity. Prior torque drivers such as 'click-type' torque wrenches do not actually limit torque application but only provide an audible warning that the limit has been reached...|$|E
