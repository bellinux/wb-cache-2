25|$|Thinking {{and feeling}} are the {{decision-making}} (judging) functions. The thinking and feeling functions are both {{used to make}} rational decisions, based on the data received from their information-gathering functions (sensing or intuition). Those who prefer thinking tend to decide things from a more detached standpoint, measuring the decision by what seems reasonable, logical, causal, consistent, and matching a given set of rules. Those who prefer feeling tend to come to decisions by associating or empathizing with the situation, looking at it 'from the inside' and weighing the situation to achieve, on balance, the greatest harmony, consensus and fit, considering {{the needs of the}} people involved. Thinkers usually have trouble interacting with people who are inconsistent or illogical, and tend to give very <b>direct</b> <b>feedback</b> to others. They are concerned with the truth and view it as more important.|$|E

Parker described it as the [...] "first sort of backlash" [...] he had experienced with South Park, with fans claiming the show was losing its edge and that Parker and Stone had [...] "sold out". Parker said, [...] "We kept hearing that word so much. We were like, 'What does that mean, sold out? What did we get and what did we do?' We just kept doing {{what we thought was}} funny, we didn't go start making commercials or anything. But everybody was saying we sold out."

500|$|Its {{name and}} {{platform}} change were officially announced at E3 2013, with further trailers showcasing the game concept released later. The 2013 trailer was again a concept piece consisting mostly of CGI rather than actual gameplay footage. Staff later stated that XV had been announced and displayed too early. The game's next official appearance {{was made at}} TGS 2014, with the announcement of its commercial demo, and a tech demo showing off the game's engine. After its reappearance, regular livestreamed shows called [...] "Active Time Reports" [...] (ATR) were broadcast, giving updates to the game and responses to fan questions. According to Tabata, the ATRs were created to help fans left confused by the game's change of platform and title, along with establishing a two-way communication with the fanbase. During 2015, official forums were created to allow the developers to receive <b>direct</b> <b>feedback</b> from fans. Starting from February 12, the Japanese forums were discontinued and replaced with a developer's blog. Their stated reason was to offer a more accessible medium for both feedback and developer updates.|$|E

In a June 2004 experiment with spear phishing, 80% of 500 West Point cadets who were sent a fake email from a non-existent Col.

2500|$|The writers {{spent time}} researching local California {{politics}} and attending Los Angeles City Council meetings. Schur said they observed that many community hearings were attended only by those opposed, often angrily, to the proposals under consideration. This fact {{became a major}} component of town hall scenes, and was the basis for the [...] "Canvassing" [...] episode. The writers consulted with real-life government officials such as urban planners and elected officials. Scott Albright, a California city planner, provided <b>direct</b> <b>feedback</b> for the Mark Brendanawicz character, and the inspiration for Ron Swanson's anti-government convictions came from a real-life encounter Schur had in Burbank with a Libertarian government official who admitted, [...] "I don't really believe in the mission of my job." [...] The concept of turning a construction pit into a park was seen as a device to bring all the characters together working toward a common goal. The writers originally envisioned the pit becoming a park only in the series finale, although those plans were later changed and the pit was filled in during the second season. While researching whether such a project could realistically last several months or longer, Schur spoke to urban planners in Claremont, California who said it was entirely plausible because they had recently broken ground on a park that had been in various planning stages for 18 years.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{initiate}} {{the study of}} the AND-OR <b>directed</b> <b>feedback</b> vertex set problem from the viewpoint of approximation algorithms. This AND-OR feedback vertex set problem is motivated by a practical deadlock resolution problem that appears in the development of distributed database systems 1. This problem also turns out be a natural generalization of the <b>directed</b> <b>feedback</b> vertex set problem. Awerbuch and Micali [1] gave a polynomial time algorithm to find a minimal solution for this problem. Unfortunately, a minimal solution can be arbitrarily more expensive than the minimum cost solution. We show that finding the minimum cost solution is as hard as the directed Steiner tree problem (and thus Ω(log 2 n) hard to approximate). On the positive side, we give algorithms which work well when the number of writers (AND nodes) or the number of readers (OR nodes) are small. We also consider a variant that we call permanent deadlock resolution where we cannot specify an execution order for the surviving processes; they should get completed even if they were scheduled adversarially. When all processes are writers (AND nodes), we give an O(log n log log n) approximation for this problem. Finally we give an LP-rounding approach and discuss some other natural variants. ...|$|R

This motivates us to study a natural generalization of tournaments, named c-tournaments, {{and see if the}} structural properties of these graphs are helpful in obtaining similar algorithms. c-tournaments are simple digraphs which have directed paths of length at most c≥ 1 between all pairs of vertices. We study the complexity of feedback vertex set and r-dominating set in c-tournaments. We also present hardness results on some graph editing problems involving c-tournaments...|$|R
