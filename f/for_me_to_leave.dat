500|$|On 12 June 2014, Premier League club Chelsea signed Fàbregas on {{a five-year}} {{contract}} for a fee {{in the region of}} €33million. Following his transfer he took the number 4 shirt, previously worn by David Luiz. Fàbregas spoke of his transfer, saying, [...] "I asked Barcelona to find a way <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the club. The president tried to stop the sale, but I already had my mind made up." [...] He went on to say, [...] "If I didn't think that I'd be happy at Chelsea, I would've never made this decision. Above all, I want to be happy both professionally and personally." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Ratcliff, Sue getting {{pregnant}} {{put her in}} a dilemma because she worried that happiness for the Osmans would need to be curtailed if she decided to leave the programme; she felt this would be unfair on viewers because of all the misery Sue had been put through on-screen already. Discussing this in 1987, Ratcliff said, [...] "I knew nothing about the baby plans until a few weeks ago when I came back from my holidays and was told that Sue was pregnant again. Sue has gone through enough {{in the last couple of}} years. I'm glad she's got her dearest wish [...] I think she'll make a great mum and I'm sure Ali will be supportive. Hopefully, the storylines will open up for me, but it also means that if the pregnancy goes well and the baby is fine, it would be very difficult <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> without there being another tragedy in the Osman family. I don't think that would be fair on the show or the viewers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not ... {{not just}} yet, mejuffrouw," [...] murmured the Jew {{somewhat}} incoherently, [...] "it {{is too early}} yet in the afternoon ... er ... <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> ... <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> my business.... I have the honour to bid the jongejuffrouw 'Godspeed.'" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{wondered}} whether I should succeed in attracting his notice, after this. Even in these private pages, my self-esteem finds {{it hard to}} confess what happened. I succeeded in reminding Philip that he had his reasons <b>for</b> requesting <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{has come}} time <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> take <b>leave</b> of you, lads," [...] the Jerseyman said {{much to my}} surprise, and I {{interrupted}} him by crying out, for it was to my mind as if the moment he departed we were standing in even more imminent danger of death than we did at that instant.|$|R
2500|$|When Narayanan {{returned}} to India in 1948, Laski {{gave him a}} letter of introduction to Prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Years later, he narrated how {{he began his career}} in the public service:When I finished with LSE, Laski, of his own, gave me a letter of introduction for Panditji. On reaching Delhi I sought an appointment with the PM. I suppose, because I was an Indian student returning home from London, I was given a time-slot. It was here in Parliament House that he met me. We talked for a few minutes about London and things like that and I could soon see that it was time <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> So I said goodbye and as I left the room I handed over the letter from Laski, and stepped out into the great circular corridor outside. When I was half way round, I heard the sound of someone clapping from the direction I had just come. I turned to see Panditji [...] beckoning me to come back. He had opened the letter as I left his room and read it. [...] "Why didn't you give this to me earlier?" [...] "Well, sir, I am sorry. I thought it would be enough if I just handed it over while leaving." [...] After a few more questions, he asked me to see him again and very soon I found myself entering the Indian Foreign Service.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{confess that}} you have conquered me, your Highness, and it only remains <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> you in {{possession}} of the field.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{will you}} give notice <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> at Christmas?" [...] said Philip, {{at the end of}} a long and often bitter conversation.|$|E
60|$|Sir LUCIUS That's no reason. <b>For</b> give <b>me</b> <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> tell you, a man {{may think}} an untruth {{as well as}} speak one.|$|R
60|$|The {{slightest}} hint {{she could}} give was enough <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I rose <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the room, and fight her battle {{for her at}} once with Mr. Fairlie.|$|R
60|$|Abdal. O, Abdelmelech, that I {{knew some}} way This debt of honour, which I owe, to pay! But fate has left this only means <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>To</b> die, and <b>leave</b> you Lyndaraxa free.|$|R
6000|$|... "Kells, I {{believe it}} would be cowardly <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> you here alone," [...] she replied, earnestly. [...] "You can't help yourself. You'd die." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My visit here," [...] he remarked, [...] "might {{easily be}} misconstrued. Would it be {{possible}} <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> without fighting my way through that mob?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is hard <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> you and sister," [...] I replied, [...] "but I must. I'm only rotting here. I'll come back--at {{least to}} visit you." ...|$|E
6000|$|DEAR SIR:-Your {{letter of}} the 8th to Hon. William Kellogg has just been shown me. You can {{scarcely}} overestimate the pleasure it would give <b>me</b> <b>to</b> oblige you, but nothing is operating so ruinously upon us everywhere as [...] "absenteeism." [...] It positively will not do <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> grant <b>leaves</b> of absence in cases not sufficient to procure them under the regular rules.|$|R
6000|$|... 'We {{are safe}} here,' said she. 'But we must listen for footsteps. I have only five minutes: Lord Mountclere is waiting <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I mean <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> this place, come what may.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I can't go back," [...] said Bridge; [...] "it was Grayson, the foreman, {{who made}} it so hot <b>for</b> <b>me</b> I had <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> He tried <b>to</b> arrest <b>me</b> and send <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Villa." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' {{replied the}} girl, shaking her head. 'It's not very easy <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> him unless he knows why; I couldn't {{give him a}} drink of {{laudanum}} before I came away.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis a {{good time}} <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave,</b> now. My cousin, the Earl Marischal Keith, {{returned}} here three days ago, and I will get him {{to go with me}} to the king." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{father has}} been too ill <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> him," [...] he said, in a low tone. [...] "I spoke of him as my mate before, but he is my father." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is telling}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go, I suppose?" [...] said, Fraser, {{looking at her}} frankly. [...] "I wish I knew {{how to talk to}} you. When I think of you being here all alone, without friends and without employment, it seems wrong <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go and <b>leave</b> you here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You speak too kindly, father," [...] {{the youth}} answered. [...] "If I had my will I should never go forth, but should end my days here in Beaulieu. It hath been my home {{as far back}} as my mind can carry me, and it is a sore thing <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> it." ...|$|R
40|$|I first want {{to thank}} my partner Ryan, <b>for</b> pushing <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the small town I had always lived in, {{in order to do}} bigger and better things with my life. I want to also thank my family for being so {{confident}} in me, and always providing words of encouragement. My friends, for putting up with my craziness during this whole thing, specifically Laurel, I don’t think I would have made it out of this “sanely” without her. A huge thanks goes out to Dr. Phyllis Rippeyoung who was there <b>for</b> <b>me</b> as my supervisor, and friend. I {{would also like to thank}} Dr. Mireille McLaughlin, who helped me push through the final steps, as well as Dr. Willow Scobie and Dr. Kathleen Rodgers for their helpful input. ii...|$|R
60|$|I {{hesitated to}} tell her that it would {{probably}} be necessary <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the country immediately, but she did not encourage me to go on, and, glancing round, I discovered that she was fast asleep.|$|E
60|$|I had had two {{children}} by him and no more, for, to tell the truth, it began to be time <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> bearing children, for I was now eight-and-forty, and I suppose if he had lived I should have had no more.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Bob, I {{mean that}} as I've never yet begun to drink, it ain't {{possible}} <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> it off, d'ee see, though I {{was to try}} ever so hard. Howsever, I'll become an abstainer all the same, just to keep company along wi' you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's amazing," [...] {{said the}} officer, [...] "what excuses these invalids of mine make {{to get back}} to barracks. There's a man in my company now asked <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> go back to cantonments to pay a debt he'd forgotten. I was so taken by the idea I let him go, and he jingled off in an ekka as pleased as Punch. Ten miles to pay a debt! Wonder what it was really?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{completed}} {{the first half}} of my freshman year, and in January of 1897 took up my courses for the second half. But the pressure from lack of money, plus a conviction that the university was not giving me all that I wanted in the time I could spare <b>for</b> it, forced <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> I was not very disappointed. For two years I had studied, and in those two years, what was far more valuable, I had done a prodigious amount of reading. Then, too, my grammar had improved. It is true, I had not yet learned that I must say [...] "It is I"; but I no longer was guilty of a double negative in writing, though still prone to that error in excited speech.|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} to whom I owe much thanks for their love, encouragement, and support {{throughout}} the process of pursuing my doctoral degree and writing this dissertation. Dr. Roseanna Davidson, {{thank you for the}} privilege of working with you and learning from you. For the opportunities you have provided me, I am most appreciative. Dr. Effie Laman, thank you <b>for</b> encouraging <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the realm of elementary school to pursue a career in higher education. For your early morning phone calls <b>to</b> check on <b>me,</b> I will always be grateful. Dr. Williams, thank you for serving on my committee, for your positive input regarding the analysis of my data, and for your always prompt reply to my inquiries. Dr. Reese Todd, thank you for your smiles, your words of encouragement, and <b>for</b> meeting <b>me</b> <b>for</b> coffee. Dr. DeAnn Lechtenberger, thank you for being my friend. I appreciate you. I thank Barbara Hargrove, Pam Lindell, and Kelly Golden for what they do day in and day out. Thank you Barbara for making sure I was actually enrolled in my classes and for tending to other tedious paperwork, allowing <b>me</b> <b>to</b> concentrate on my course work. Pam, thanks for your willingness to drop what you were doing in order t...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps we {{have caught}} him," [...] said Jonas, [...] "but {{it is not}} certain; {{sometimes}} the trap gets sprung accidentally. However, you may go and ask your father if he thinks it worth while <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> my work long enough {{to go down and}} see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Nay, nay, dear boy,’ protested Zero. ‘There is now no call <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> My {{character}} is now reinstated; my fame brightens; {{this is the}} best thing I have done yet; and I see from here the ovations that await the author of the Golden Square Atrocity.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It warn't easy, Pip, <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> them parts, nor yet it warn't safe. But I held to it, and {{the harder}} it was, the {{stronger}} I held, for I was determined, and my mind firm made up. At last I done it. Dear boy, I done it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You, Mabel!" [...] {{returned}} the guide, taking {{the hand of}} our heroine and looking up into her countenance with guileless simplicity, but earnest affection; [...] "How could I be sorry that a ray of the sun came across the gloom of a cheerless day--that light has broken in upon darkness, though it remained so short a time? I do not flatter myself with being able to march quite so light-hearted as I once used to could, or to sleep as sound, {{for some time to}} come; but I shall always remember how near I was to being undeservedly happy, I shall. So far from blaming you, Mabel, I only blame myself for being so vain as to think it possible I could please such a creatur'; for sartainly you told me how it was, when we talked it over on the mountain, and I ought to have believed you then; for I do suppose it's nat'ral that young women should know their own minds better than their fathers. Ah's me! It's settled now, and nothing remains but <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> take <b>leave</b> of you, that you may depart; I feel that Master Cap must be impatient, and there is danger of his coming on shore to look for us all." ...|$|R
5000|$|On 3 July 2008, Sanderson and Arsenal {{teammate}} Anita Asante joined Chelsea Ladies. Upon signing Sanderson said, [...] "I {{always said}} I would never play {{for anyone else}} other than Chelsea. I have been at Arsenal for 11 years {{and it is a}} big change <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the team, but both Anita and I wanted a new challenge. Sometimes you have to try new things and challenge yourself personally and I know that is what I am looking forward to doing here. So now I am just looking forward to what's ahead. Hopefully Anita and I will come in and help Chelsea win things." [...] Arsenal manager Vic Akers publicly criticised the players for the manner of their departure: [...] "You think you've the respect of players, and then they do that. It's a sorry state of affairs." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{thought it}} was time <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{withdraw}} and <b>leave</b> them, and I did so, but not so far but that I heard all their discourse, in which I heard abundance of the fine things said of myself, which served to prompt my vanity, but, as I soon found, was not the way to increase my interest in the family, for the sister and the younger brother fell grievously out about it; and as he said some very disobliging things to her upon my account, so I could easily see that she resented them by her future conduct <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> which indeed was very unjust <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>for</b> I had never had the least thought of what she suspected as to her younger brother; indeed, the elder brother, in his distant, remote way, had said a great many things as in jest, which I had the folly to believe were in earnest, or to flatter myself with the hopes of what I ought to have supposed he never intended, and perhaps never thought of.|$|R
