5|$|Only a few {{organized}} groups {{got behind}} the <b>hue</b> <b>and</b> <b>cry.</b> Most influential was the libertarian Association of Physicians and Surgeons, and Dan Smoot's newsletter. Right-wing groups bombarded Congress with protests and demands for hearings.|$|E
5|$|The {{plot was}} an {{original}} story by T. E. B. Clarke, {{a writer of}} both comedy and drama scripts for Ealing; his other screenplays for the studio include <b>Hue</b> <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> (1947), Against the Wind (1948), The Blue Lamp (1950), The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) and The Titfield Thunderbolt (1953). Clarke was inspired by an incident during the Second World War, when the maternity ward of Ottawa Civic Hospital was temporarily declared extraterritorial by the Canadian government {{so that when the}} then-Princess Juliana of the Netherlands gave birth to Princess Margriet of the Netherlands, the baby was born on international territory, thus not on Canadian territory (though not on Dutch territory), and would not lose her right to the throne. The airlift of food supplies into the Burgundian enclave was influenced by the flights of food and supplies during the Berlin Blockade of June 1948 – May 1949. The music for the film was composed by Georges Auric, who had been involved in several other productions for Ealing Studios.|$|E

50|$|At {{the end of}} the day and {{consequent}} upon series of negotiation between the Federal Government and the ASUU leadership, the strike was called off not without an agreement to be implemented by both parties. ASUU reportedly ensured the insertion of a “no victimization clause” into the agreement. The essence of this was to guarantee that none of its members who partook in the strike would be persecuted because of their involvement. However, the University of Nigeria, (UNN), Nsukka and University of Ilorin terminated the appointment of some lecturers perceived to have played prominent roles in ensuring the success of the strike by ASUU. UNN authorities after public <b>hues</b> <b>and</b> <b>cries</b> reinstated its sacked lecturers. But in Unilorin, its authorities refused to reverse itself. 103 lecturers were given sack letters that did not state the reasons behind the decision.|$|R

25|$|Scotland {{produced}} a few punk bands of note, such as The Exploited, The Rezillos, The Skids, The Fire Engines, and the Scars. However, {{it was not}} until the post-punk era of the early 1980s, that Scotland really came into its own, with bands like Cocteau Twins, Orange Juice, The Associates, Simple Minds, Maggie Reilly, Annie Lennox (Eurythmics), <b>Hue</b> <b>and</b> <b>Cry,</b> Goodbye Mr. Mackenzie, The Jesus and Mary Chain, Wet Wet Wet, Big Country, The Proclaimers and Josef K.

25|$|There was an {{immediate}} <b>hue</b> <b>and</b> <b>cry,</b> with a price of £100 on his head. The police issued a description that was somewhat inaccurate, {{and had to be}} altered. But in any case, Peace was changing his appearance, concealing his missing finger with an ingenious prosthetic arm, and moving around the country to try to avoid detection. In Nottingham, he made another fateful meeting, with a Mrs. Sue Thompson, who would become his mistress, but would eventually betray his whereabouts to the police (who denied her the £100 reward on the grounds that her evidence did not lead directly to Peace's conviction).|$|E
25|$|The Ealing comedies of the 1940s and 1950s made {{repeated}} use {{of locations}} in the city. <b>Hue</b> <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> (1947) and Passport to Pimlico (1949) were memorably set in the ruins and bombsites of post-war London. In the 1950s The Lavender Hill Mob made extensive use of London locations, as did the dramas The Blue Lamp and Pool of London, while The Ladykillers used King's Cross Station and its surrounding marshalling yards as the backdrop to its story. The 1952 film The Happy Family is set on the South Bank during the lead up to the Festival of Britain.|$|E
5000|$|... "That Girl" [...] {{is a song}} by American R&B {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Stevie Wonder. The song was the leading single from Wonder's album-era greatest-hits compilation, Stevie Wonder's Original Musiquarium I, as one of four newer songs from the collection. The song spent nine weeks at {{number one on the}} Billboard R&B singles chart and reached number four on the Billboard Hot 100. The song would later be sampled by rapper 2Pac on his song, [...] "So Many Tears" [...] and covered by R&B singer Joe. The song was sampled by Queen Latifah on her album Order in the Court on the non-U.S. track [...] "Let Her Live". A cover version appears on UK band <b>Hue</b> <b>and</b> <b>Cry's</b> 1992 album [...] "Truth & Love". MJG, one half of the hip-hop duo 8Ball & MJG also sampled the song of the same name on his 1997 solo debut No More Glory.|$|R
40|$|Nigeria, {{which is}} a {{developing}} country, runs the most expensive legislature in the world. Its National Assembly is the world’s biggest democracy cost centre. The current emolument structure of the political office holders in Nigeria has since implementationthrown up <b>hues</b> <b>and</b> <b>cries</b> in the polity because the emoluments, {{when compared with the}} salary structure of federal or state civil servants, shows a disparity which gives an insight into the desperation for political offices in the country. This research employs the secondary data approach to explore the implications and concerns this phenomenon portends for good governance, transparency, equity, and sustainable development. The study finds that the bias emolument, which shows a 150 percent increase over year 2000 recommendations, taunts Nigeria with dangerous socio-economic consequences. It presents the emerging discipline of forensic accounting which is the application of accounting, auditing and investigative techniques to legal issues as the way out of this leadership quagmire by recommending a strong political resolve towards the promotion of forensic accounting techniques to solving corruption and development related problems...|$|R
40|$|Various {{scholars}} and researches {{have identified a}} number of traditions guiding the development of teacher education programmes. These include “the academic ” tradition, “the social efficiency ” tradition, “the developmentalist ” tradition, otherwise referred to as the “personalist ” or “humanist ” tradition, and “the social reconstructionist ” tradition. Education is the pivot of development in all countries, (Nigeria is no exception), and the availability of well-trained and highly qualified teachers is central to the supply of human capital needed to promote qualitative education. The training of teachers in Nigeria, which started in 1859 with the establishment of “The Training Institute”, at Abeokuta, has metamorphosed into present citadels of learning, where highly skilled manpower in the art of teaching are trained in large numbers yearly. However, the current <b>hues</b> <b>and</b> <b>cries</b> about the failing standard of education in Nigeria can be blamed partly on the patterns of teachers supply, their quality, and their level of performance. It is the attempt to unravel the validity of this assertion that has informed this paper...|$|R

Her stage appearances were mostly in legitimate theatre, such as W. Somerset Maugham's comedy, Mrs. Dot, with Dame Marie Tempest and Ben Jonson's The Vision of Delight, both in 1908. She played in his masque The <b>Hue</b> <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> after Cupid in 1911. Moore toured America and Australia, as well as appearing throughout the British Isles and in concerts at major venues, such as Albert Hall and St. James's Hall, until 1914. Her last London stage appearance was in a matinée performance of Vantage Out in 1914.|$|E
25|$|Penry and Waldegrave then {{embarked}} on an even more controversial enterprise, the printing of the first four of the seven tracts written against the ecclesiastical authorities by an unknown satirist using the pseudonym Martin Marprelate. The first of the Marprelate tracts, Martin's Epistle, was printed at East Molesey in October 1588. It enjoyed immense popularity, and the ecclesiastical authorities instigated a <b>hue</b> <b>and</b> <b>cry</b> after Martin, {{as a result of}} which Penry moved the secret press to Sir Richard Knightley's house at Fawsley in Northamptonshire, where Martin's second tract, The Epitome, was printed. Shortly thereafter the press was moved East Molesey to the Whitefriars, Coventry, the home of Knightley's great-nephew, John Hales, where Certain Mineral and Metaphysical Schoolpoints and Hay Any Work for Cooper were printed, the former in early January and the latter in late March 1589. Waldegrave then refused to print any further tracts, citing the Puritan ministers' disapproval of Martin Marprelate's course of action.|$|E
500|$|When Playford and the Executive Council {{decided not}} to reprieve Stuart, {{an appeal to the}} Privy Council was made to stall the execution. [...] Spearheaded by Dunstan, Labor then tried to {{introduce}} legislation to stall the hanging. Amid <b>hue</b> <b>and</b> <b>cry,</b> Playford started a Royal Commission to review the case. However, two of the commissioners had already been involved in the trial and one of the appeals. This provoked worldwide controversy with claims of bias from Dunstan and Labor, who also attacked Playford for what they regarded as a too-restrictive scope of inquiry.|$|E

40|$|In recent times, {{there have}} been much <b>hues</b> <b>and</b> <b>cries</b> over the {{continuous}} poor standard of education in Nigeria. This has been blamed predominantly on the teachers, their teaching methods and techniques, attitude to work, competence and general behavior. This unpleasant development somewhat put to question the efficacy of teacher education content particularly micro-teaching which serves as the meeting point of both theory and practice in the pre-service training of teachers. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the modes of improving the pre-service teacher competence and productivity based on the constructive reflection of student teaching, with a focus on micro-teaching which is adjudged as an avenue for acquiring pre-service pedagogical knowledge and field experiences. The study seeks to highlight the efficacy of micro-teaching in facilitating effective teacher preparation. It employs a combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods. In its quantitative dimension, the study features a descriptive survey design with research questionnaire administered on 500 respondents randomly sampled across five institutions. In its qualitative dimension, the study employs inductive and deductive research methods and analysis where data were collected and analysed based on existing framework and emerging themes on reflective effect of micro-teaching and field experiences, as decided in advance by the researchers. The study revealed that micro-teaching content, resources and material need to be reviewed for optimum result. Multi channel-viewing and other forms of Information Communication Technology (lCT) gadgets need to be introduced as a matter of urgency...|$|R

500|$|The {{establishment}} of the scholarship drew a letter of protest to the college from the Iranian embassy in London. [...] It was written in November 2009 and signed by the deputy ambassador, Safarali Eslamian. The letter disputed the circumstances of her death, and {{said that there was}} [...] "supporting evidence indicating a pre-made scenario". Eslamain wrote, [...] "It seems that the University of Oxford has stepped up involvement in a politically motivated campaign which is not only in sharp contract with its academic objectives, but also is linked with a chain of events in post-Iranian presidential elections blamed for British interference both at home and abroad". [...] The letter also said that the [...] "decision to abuse Neda's case to establish a graduate scholarship will highly politicise your academic institution, undermining your scientific credibility – along with British press which made exceptionally a lot of <b>hue</b> <b>and</b> <b>cry</b> on Neda's death – will make Oxford at odd [...] {{with the rest of the}} world's academic institutions". Eslamain asked for the university's governing board to be informed of [...] "the Iranian views", and finished by saying, [...] "Surely, your steps to achieve your attractions through non-politically supported programmes can better heal the wounds of her family and her nation".|$|E
500|$|Turpin is {{best known}} for his {{exploits}} as a highwayman, but before his execution the only contemporary report of him as such was in June 1737, when a broadsheet entitled [...] "News news: great and wonderful news from London in an uproar or a <b>hue</b> <b>and</b> <b>cry</b> after the Great Turpin, with his escape into Ireland" [...] was published. [...] Although some of his contemporaries became the subject of chapbooks, names such as James Hind, Claude Duval and William Nevison, are not nearly as well-known today as the legend of Dick Turpin, whose fictionalised exploits first began to appear around the turn of the 19th century. [...] It was, however, the story of a fabled ride from London to York that provided the impetus for 19th-century author William Harrison Ainsworth to include and embellish the exploit in his 1834 novel Rookwood. [...] Ainsworth used Turpin as a plot device, describing him in a manner that makes him more lively than the book's other characters. [...] Turpin is introduced with the pseudonym Palmer, and is later forced to escape on his horse, Black Bess. [...] Although fast enough to keep ahead of those in pursuit, Black Bess eventually dies under the stress of the journey. [...] This scene appealed more to readers than the rest of the work, and as Turpin was depicted as a likeable character who made the life of a criminal seem appealing, the story came to form part of the modern legend surrounding Turpin. The artist Edward Hull capitalised on Ainsworth's story, publishing six prints of notable events in Turpin's career.|$|E

6000|$|The {{process is}} rapid and certain, when, though {{there may be}} little [...] to catch the {{multitude}} at once, there is much which they can enjoy [...] when their attention is authoritatively directed to it.

Receiving no response, following a rash of violent incidents in Kashmir Valley in June 1951 and reports of Pakistani troop movements, India decided to move its troops to the border. According to Nehru, [...] "our lack of proper defenses on our frontiers would itself be an invitation to attack." [...] A military stand-off ensued, lasting from mid-July 1951 till the assassination of Liaquat Ali Khan in October 1951.
