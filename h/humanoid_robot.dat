5|$|In Japan, Waseda University {{initiated}} the WABOT project in 1967, and in 1972 completed the WABOT-1, the world's first full-scale intelligent <b>humanoid</b> <b>robot,</b> or android. Its limb control system {{allowed it to}} walk with the lower limbs, and to grip and transport objects with hands, using tactile sensors. Its vision system allowed it to measure distances and directions to objects using external receptors, artificial eyes and ears. And its conversation system allowed it to communicate with a person in Japanese, with an artificial mouth.|$|E
5|$|The initial Western {{release of}} the game, while keeping the basic plot the same, {{significantly}} changed some details from the original Japanese manual. In this version, Dr. Light and Dr. Wily (here Light's assistant turned disloyal) co-create the <b>humanoid</b> <b>robot</b> Mega Man alongside the six advanced robots, each of whom were designed {{for the benefit of}} Monsteropolis's citizens (no such place existed in the original plot). Dr. Wily grows disloyal of his partner and reprograms these six robots to aid himself in taking control of the world, creating the seven empires of Monsteropolis. Dr. Light sends Mega Man to destroy his fellow creations and stop Dr. Wily.|$|E

Depending on the given timeline, the characters also discover either the murdered body of an old woman or antimatter bombs. The other participants' backstories are explored: Luna is a <b>humanoid</b> <b>robot,</b> tasked with maintaining the Nonary Game; K was raised by Zero Sr. inside of the facility; Tenmyouji willingly joined the game, together with his adopted grandson Quark, after being promised a chance to find a certain woman; Alice and Clover are government secret agents tasked with stopping the religious cult Free the Soul; and Dio is a member of Free the Soul.|$|E

25|$|By 1952, Ambassador Atom {{proved to}} be only a mild success in Japan; however, one {{particular}} character became extremely popular with young boys: a <b>humanoid</b> <b>robot</b> named Atom. Tezuka received several letters from many young boys requesting further appearances from the robot. Expecting success with a series based around Atom, Tezuka's producer suggested that he be given human emotions. One day while working at a hospital Tezuka was punched in the face by a frustrated American G.I. This encounter gave Tezuka the idea to make Atom a <b>humanoid</b> <b>robot</b> fighting evil and defending the innocent. On February 4, 1952, Tetsuwan Atom began serialization in Weekly Shonen Magazine. The character Atom and his adventures became an instant phenomenon in Japan.|$|E
40|$|For {{the aim of}} {{developing}} a psychological tool specific for measuring general public's acceptance of <b>humanoid</b> <b>robots</b> including expectation and anxiety toward this technology, and exploring factors influencing the acceptance, the research focused {{on the concept of}} "Frankenstein Syndrome" and effects of age and experience into the degrees. Along the concept, the research has been developing a questionnaire to measure feelings toward acceptance of humanoids in humans. A preliminary survey conducted in Japan suggested : 1) the younger population has negative feelings toward <b>humanoid</b> <b>robots,</b> in comparison with the elder population; 2) these feelings in the younger population are not discouraged by experiences of real <b>humanoid</b> <b>robots</b> or experiences of the robots via media information; 3) women have negative feelings toward <b>humanoid</b> <b>robots</b> in comparison with men; 4) the above experiences of <b>humanoid</b> <b>robots</b> increase expectation toward <b>humanoid</b> <b>robots</b> in daily life in the elder female population, although they do not affect the expectation in the younger female population.

It was the first <b>humanoid</b> <b>robot</b> in space, and was stowed on board the Leonardo PMM. Once Robonaut2 was unpacked, it began initial operation inside the Destiny module for operational testing, but over time, both its location and its applications could expand.|$|E
