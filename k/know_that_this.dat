5|$|This {{language}} is not from the Court’s opinion in Lucas v. Earl. Instead, it is an almost direct quotation from page 17 of the taxpayer's brief filed in the case. Guy C. Earl was the taxpayer, and the brief was written by Earl’s attorneys: Warren Olney Jr., J.M. Mannon, Jr., and Henry D. Costigan. In some printed versions of the case, this statement and other quotations and paraphrases from pages 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 of the taxpayer's brief are re-printed as a headnote or syllabus above {{the opinion of the}} Court. In the case reprints that include this headnote (and many of them do not even show it), these excerpts are not clearly identified as being from the taxpayer's brief. A person not trained in analysis of legal materials would not necessarily <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> verbiage, like any headnote or syllabus, {{is not part of the}} Court’s opinion, perhaps leading to the confusion about the source of the quotation. As explained below, the Supreme Court rejected the arguments in the quotation, and the taxpayer lost the case.|$|E

Use 'Zhan, Lian, Nian, and Sui' (sticky, link, adhering, and complying). Everywhere you need to be empty and not exerting strength. The whole body must be blending and smooth (hun yuan - smooth roundness) and not starting and stopping. This is the skill of 'The opponent does not know me, I alone know the opponent.' At any time, place, or moment you can emit (fa), but only emitting force at the precise moment. This is the Hua Jing stage.|$|E

Discussions had not borne fruit between Schuyler and Washington by early June.

He also provided information on a proposed French-American invasion of Quebec that was to go up the Connecticut River (Arnold did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> proposed invasion was a ruse intended to divert British resources). On June 16, Arnold inspected West Point while on his way home to Connecticut to take care of personal business, and he sent a highly detailed report through the secret channel. When he reached Connecticut, Arnold arranged to sell his home there and began transferring assets to London through intermediaries in New York. By early July, he was back in Philadelphia, where he wrote another secret message to Clinton on July 7 which implied that his appointment to West Point was assured and that he might even provide a [...] "drawing of the works ... by which you might take [...] without loss".|$|E
500|$|Despite having {{plans for}} a tour of Europe to promote Spiderland, Slint broke up in November 1990, after Brian McMahan decided to quit the band. Members of the band went on to join other musical projects, {{including}} Tortoise, The Breeders, Palace and The For Carnation. Slint reunited briefly in 2005 for an eighteen-date tour.

It took some getting used to, some revisiting the material and rehearsing."

500|$|Initially, Che {{was going}} to be made in English and was met with a strong {{interest}} in financing; however, when {{the decision was made to}} make it in Spanish and break it up into two films, the studios' pay-TV deals, which were for English-language product only, [...] "disappeared", according to Bickford, [...] "and, at that point, nobody wanted to step up". The director defended his decision to shoot almost all of the film in Spanish in an interview: [...] "You can't make a film with any level of credibility in this case unless it's in Spanish. I hope we're reaching a time where you go make a movie in another culture, that you shoot in the language of that culture. I'm hoping the days of that sort of specific brand of cultural imperialism have ended". Both films were financed without any American money or distribution deal; [...] Soderbergh remarked, [...] "It was very frustrating to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is a zeitgeist movie and that some of the very people who told me how much they now regret passing on Traffic passed on this one too". Foreign pre-sales covered $54 million of the $58 million budget. Wild Bunch, a French production, distribution and foreign sales company put up 75% of the budget for the two films, tapping into a production and acquisition fund from financing and investment company Continental Entertainment Capitol, a subsidiary of the U.S.-based Citigroup. Spain's Telecinco/Moreno Films supplied the rest of the budget.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} gained a {{significant}} amount of airplay on the BET and MTV networks, as it increased mainstream notice and appeal of D'Angelo upon the release of Voodoo in January 2000. Viewer response to the [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] music video was largely divided along sexual lines, as female viewers generally expressed favor to the video. Additionally, D'Angelo's video appearance, including a notable amount of sweating around his abdomen, contributed to rumors of him receiving oral sex in the video. For an April 2000 article for Vibe, Questlove interviewed D'Angelo and asked him [...] "Are you getting head in that video?", after which D'Angelo responded by laughing. Questlove then asked [...] "So you're not going to answer that?", and D'Angelo responded, [...] "No". In her response to the video, television personality Star Jones said that, [...] "D'Angelo is singing about being intimate with a woman that he loves, and it's just basic voice and body, and when you're in an intimate situation with a man, that's really all that's there — the voice and the body and the light hitting the body {{in a way that makes}} you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is your man". Danyel Smith, editor for Time Inc. at the time, said [...] "It's so sexy. It's about time that girls had something luscious to look at while they're listening to a song. For years, men have been treated to breasts and butts along with their favorite songs, and women have had to just sit there and endure." [...] In an interview for The New York Times, Smith also said that she had encountered an appreciative reaction among women to the adult sexuality of the music video.

500|$|Scar has {{garnered}} widespread acclaim from film critics, {{some of whom}} praised him as {{a better}} character than Simba. Author Peter M. Nichols wrote in his book New York Times Essential Library: Children's Movies: A Critic's Guide to the Best Films Available on Video and DVD that Scar [...] "is the most interesting character in the film," [...] describing Simba and Mufasa [...] "bores in comparison." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times called Scar a [...] "delectably wicked" [...] villain. Maslin went on to praise Irons' voice acting, writing that the actor [...] "slithers through the story in grandiose high style, with a green-eyed malevolence {{that is one of}} film's chief delights." [...] Leah Rozen of People described Scar as [...] "a flawless realization of Irons' special talent." [...] Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune lauded Scar as the film's [...] "best character," [...] jokingly describing him as [...] "Irons' Claus von Bulow with fur." [...] Similarly, ComingSoon.net's Joshua Starnes hailed Scar as [...] "the best part of the film." [...] Praising both Scar and Irons' acting, Starnes continued, [...] "He switches so quickly and easily from campy to deadly its like a showcase for how to do an over-the-top villain right." [...] Concluding that [...] "Villains are often the most memorable characters in a Disney animated film," [...] Roger Ebert described Scar [...] "one of the great ones." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews reviewed, [...] "Gone is the buffoonery that has marked the recent trio of Ursula, Gaston, and Jafar," [...] writing, [...] "Scar is a sinister figure, given to acid remarks and cunning villainy." [...] Berardinelli concluded, [...] "The cold-hearted manner in which he causes Mufasa's death lets us <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is not a lion to be trifled with." ...|$|E

[...] I just want to let Atlanta know and Ciara <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is a true leak. I did, and I don't know if Polow said this on the radio, but I did fight this coming out. I didn't want this coming out because we played it for people when I did it and that's what people said it was about; they started throwing out names. We were like 'No, it's not about that' and we tried to let them know what it was really about. But the fact that people brought back names, it was like ok, that wasn't the reaction we need, so I told Polow, 'let's not do this and he agreed". Ciara happened to call in during the time period and said she was happy of where Hilson was at in her career, to which Hilson responded the same, saying how proud she was, and [...] "watching her from ground zero." [...] Hilson went on to state she was not jealous of anyone's career, noting how all female R artists are the same, pointing out that [...] "Keyshia’s on my album. I’ve worked with Ciara many times. I’m a fan of Beyoncé’s."
