30|$|It {{has been}} {{challenge}} to improve prognose of diseases, such as brain tumor, Alzheimer’s diseases (AD), and Parkinson’s diseases (PD) [1 – 3] {{in a central}} nervous system (CNS) compared to other body parts. An enormous effort has been made for discovery and development of CNS drugs that can elude toward new and effective treatments; however, more than 90 % of newly proposed drugs have failed to receive clinical approvals from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [4]. One of major difficulties {{for the development of}} CNS treatments is the presence of a tighten blood–brain barrier (BBB) limiting drug entry to the CNS region [5]. Additionally, non-targeted delivery of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>reagents</b> or therapeutic drugs can cause detrimental effects on the neuronal cells and glial cells, extremely sensitive cellular components in the CNS maintaining brain functions and homeostasis. In this regard, it is an urgent issue to design and develop novel delivery platforms bearing the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>reagents</b> or therapeutic drugs for the neurological disorders.|$|R
40|$|Highly {{pathogenic}} H 5 N 1 {{avian influenza}} viruses emerged in 1996 and have since evolved so extensively {{that a single}} strain {{can no longer be}} used as a prepandemic vaccine or <b>diagnostic</b> <b>reagent.</b> We therefore sought to identify the H 5 N 1 strains that may best serve as cross-reactive diagnostic reagents. We compared the cross-reactivity of 27 viruses of clades 0, 1, 2. 1, 2. 2, 2. 3, and 4 and of four computationally designed ancestral H 5 N 1 strains by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and microneutralization (MN) assays. Antigenic cartography was used to analyze the large quantity of resulting data. Cartographs of HI titers with chicken red blood cells were similar to those of MN titers, but HI with horse red blood cells decreased antigenic distances among the H 5 N 1 strains studied. Thus, HI with horse red blood cells seems to be the assay of choice for H 5 N 1 diagnostics. Whereas clade 2. 2 antigens were able to detect antibodies raised to most of the tested H 5 N 1 viruses (and clade 2. 2 -specific antisera detected most of the H 5 N 1 antigens), ancestral strain A exhibited the widest reactivity pattern and hence was the best candidate <b>diagnostic</b> <b>reagent</b> for broad detection of H 5 N 1 strains. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The Toxoplasma gondii {{major surface}} antigen, called SAG 1 or p 30, {{is a highly}} {{immunogenic}} protein which has generated great interest as a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>reagent,</b> as a potential subunit vaccine, and for its role in invasion. Unfortunately, bacterial recombinant protein is grossly misfolded so that, for example, it is not effectively recognized by antibodies to native SAG 1. To overcome this, we have turned to expression in CHO cells, using cotransfection of the SAG 1 gene and the mouse dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene into CHO cells that are DHFR-. SAG 1 expression was amplified by methotrexate coselection of CHO cells in combination with fluorescence-activated cell sorting for SAG 1 expression. The resulting population expressed recombinant SAG 1 that is recognized by antiserum specific for natural, nonreduced SAG 1, indicating that, unlike in bacteria, expression in CHO cells results in proper folding. Processing was at least partially correct in that, like natural SAG 1, recombinant SAG 1 {{was attached to the}} plasma membrane via a glycolipid anchor, although tunicamycin treatment was necessary to prevent N-glycosylation (SAG 1 is not glycosylated in the parasite but does have a consensus N-linked site). Finally, purified recombinant SAG 1 was recognized by human sera known to be reactive to toxoplasma proteins, indicating that this material has potential as a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>reagent</b> and possibly as a component of a subunit vaccine...|$|E

40|$|The {{threat of}} West Nile virus (WNV) {{epidemics}} necessitates {{the development of}} a technology platform that can produce reagents to support detection and diagnosis rapidly and inexpensively.

40|$|The {{resurgence}} of tuberculosis, {{the emergence of}} multiple drug resistant tuberculosis, and the increasing prevalence of mycobacterial disease in AIDS patients have increased the importance of defining new mycobacterial antigens that can be utilized {{in the development of}} improved <b>diagnostic</b> <b>reagents</b> and more effective vaccines. In this report, a highly immunogenic Mycobacterium kansasii protein (MK 35) and the gene encoding this antigen were characterized. MK 35 gene probes reacted with genomic DNA from M. avium, M. bovis BCG, M. intracellulare and M. tuberculosis but not with DNA isolated from nine other mycobacterial species. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that the MK 35 gene encodes a 26 kDa protein which contains a consensus bacterial lipoprotein processing sequence. In addition, detergent-phase separation studies strongly suggested that MK 35 is a lipoprotein. Skin test assays demonstrated that MK 35 elicited a strong response in guinea pigs sensitized with M. kansasii but did not react in M. tuberculosis-sensitized guinea pigs.

Each urine sample was observed for gross haematuria and thereafter tested for mild haematuria using a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>reagent</b> strip. The pooled prevalence of mild haematuria was 22. 6 %. The prevalence of mild haematuria in the urban centre (16. 9 %) and the rural communities (26. 9 %) were statistically similar (x = 2. 28, P> 0. 05). The prevalence among males (23. 9 %) was not significantly different 2 from that among females (21. 3 %) (x = 0. 15, P> 0. 05). 17 % of the school children with mild haematuria indulged 2 in swimming and bathing in streams and ponds, 8. 5 % had experienced bloody urine, while 10. 6 % were swimming and bathing in streams and ponds and had also experienced bloody urine.
