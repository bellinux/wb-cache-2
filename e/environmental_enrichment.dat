It was thus concluded that both the activating and rewarding effects are suppressed by <b>environmental</b> <b>enrichment</b> and early exposure to <b>environmental</b> <b>enrichment</b> can help prevent drug addiction.|$|E
25|$|Research {{on animals}} finds that <b>environmental</b> <b>enrichment</b> could aid the {{treatment}} and recovery of numerous brain-related dysfunctions, including Alzheimer's disease and those connected to aging, whereas a lack of stimulation might impair cognitive development.

40|$|AbstractAnimals {{housed in}} a cage with {{clustered}} <b>environmental</b> <b>enrichments</b> may deal with higher aggression {{when they have to}} compete for depleting resources. In this study, the effects of the way <b>environmental</b> <b>enrichments</b> distributed between individuals were investigated. Sixteen adult male mice (Mus musculus) were housed in four different treatments with manipulation in terms of food choices availability and distribution of resources. Each male was observed for their aggressive and stereotypic behaviours for seven minutes twice a day for five days. The faeces were also collected after each treatment for measuring the corticosterone level in order to indicate the stress level of the mice. The results showed reduced aggression (p< 0. 05), stereotypic behaviour (p< 0. 05) and corticosterone level (p< 0. 05) in both dispersed environment and food available environment compared to the clustered environment {{as well as in the}} environment where the food choices were not available. From the results, it can be suggested that resources are better arranged in a dispersed way, so that the resources are easier to be shared. Thus, with lesser aggression and stereotypic behaviour, the welfare of the laboratory mice can be improved and easily managed...|$|R
40|$|Felids are {{displayed}} in zoos and parks {{all over the world}} but are often kept in unsuitable enclosures. Stereotypic behaviours are therefore commonly observed in large captive cats caused by a lack of a stimulating environment. To prevent this, keepers use different enrichments to encourage animals to express natural behaviours such as running, investigating and playing. Play behaviour has recently attained more attention and has been suggested to be an indicator of good welfare as well as possibly being the cause of it. This study aimed to investigate if play can be stimulated by presenting <b>environmental</b> <b>enrichments,</b> or “toys”. In this study two litters of cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) cubs of various ages that were presented with a Boomer ball. Behavioural data were collected during two weeks. The first week was used as a baseline and during the second week a Boomer ball were presented. The result show a small increase in object play, even though the cubs did not use the Boomer ball during the time of observation. The most commonly observed type of play was contact social play, but the litters spent the majority of the time resting. This might have been affected by the chosen time of day for the observations. The results of this study did not indicate the possibility of stimulating play in cheetah cubs, but it does not rule out the possibility of a better result during different circumstances. If play could be increased by presenting <b>environmental</b> <b>enrichments</b> and if the theory of play was confirmed to cause positive emotions, this could result in a practically manageable way to improve the welfare of captive animals. Future research might hand us the tools to measure emotions in animals and the effect of how animals feel, creating a major step forward in animal keeping...|$|R

50|$|To {{attempt to}} {{eliminate}} stereotypies in captive mink, the National Farm Animal Care Council has implemented regulations on incorporating <b>environmental</b> <b>enrichments</b> into mink cages. Enrichments are pen-related alterations or {{the addition of}} novel objects to improve the minks' physical and psychological health. Enrichments may help reduce the onset of stereotypies but rarely decrease or eliminate them. Because of this, enrichments should be introduced early in life as a preventative measure. The National Farm Animal Care Council stated that ‘juvenile female pastel mink raised with access to a nest box performed fewer stereotypies from mid-September to late October than those without access to a nest box.’ Due to this, mink have access year round to a nest box and spend {{the majority of their}} time resting within. Thus the availability and quality of the nest box play a large role in the prevention of stereotypies and a role in the animals' welfare.|$|R

40|$|Peroxisome proliferator-activated {{receptor}} alpha (PPARα) ligands {{have been}} shown to modulate recovery after brain insults such as ischemia and irradiation by enhancing neurogenesis. In the present study, we investigated the effect of the genetic deletion of PPARα receptors on the proliferative rate of neural precursor cells (NPC) in the adult brain. The study was performed in aged Pparα-/- mice exposed to nutritional (treats) and <b>environmental</b> (games) <b>enrichments</b> for 20 days. We performed immunohistochemical analyses of cells containing the replicating cell DNA marker 5 -bromo- 2 ’-deoxyuridine (BrdU+) and the immature neuronal marker doublecortin (Dcx+) in the main neurogenic zones of the adult brain: subgranular zone of dentate gyrus (SGZ), subventricular zone of lateral ventricles (SVZ) and/or hypothalamus. Results indicated a {{reduction in the number of}} BrdU+ cells in the neurogenic zones analyzed as well as Dcx+ cells in the SGZ during aging (2, 6, 18 months). Pparα deficiency alleviated the age-related reduction of NPC proliferation (BrdU+ cells) in the SVZ of the 18 -months-old mice. While no genotype effect on NPC proliferation was detected in the SGZ during aging, an accentuated reduction in the number of Dcx+ cells was observed in the SGZ of the 6 -months-old Pparα-/- mice. Exposing the 18 -months-old mice to nutritional and <b>environmental</b> <b>enrichments</b> reversed the Pparα-/ [...] induced impairment of NPC proliferation in the neurogenic zones analyzed. The enriched environment did not modify the number of SGZ Dcx+ cells in the 18 months old Pparα-/- mice.

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to measure anticipatory {{activity}} in farmed mink (Mustela vison) {{to study the}} effects of the presence of <b>environmental</b> <b>enrichments</b> in three housing systems differing in cage structure and in the amount of enrichments. In studies on laboratory rats, anticipatory activity is used as a parameter for potentially stressful conditions of different housing systems: enriched housed rats were less sensitive to sucrose-rewards than standard housed rats as shown by a lower anticipatory reactivity suggesting less stressful conditions. Anticipatory activity in 36 adult female mink was elicited in a Pavlovian paradigm with tasty cat food as reward in January 2002. This Pavlovian paradigm was followed by an observation of stereotypical behaviour in February 2002. The Pavlovian paradigm and the observations of stereotypical behaviour were preceded by observations on juvenile mink behaviour (7 ¿ 11 weeks of age) in the Summer of 2001. The results of this study show (1) that mink juveniles in the most enriched system had more variable behaviour suggesting better coping potentials and (2) that mink, just like rats, can be trained to anticipate on reward. However, in contrast to the behavioural results of the juveniles, no significant long-term effects of the additional enrichments were found as measured by anticipatory activity and stereotypical behaviour, suggesting no differences between the experimental housing systems in terms of stress...|$|R

40|$|The {{main results}} and {{observations}} on group and individually housed rabbit does were reviewed by Szendrő and McNitt in 2012, {{but in recent}} years several new papers in this field have been published. This provides a new opportunity to summarise the current knowledge on alternative housing systems for breeding does. In Switzerland, rabbit does are generally housed in group systems. The recently legislated Belgian and Dutch housing systems will be converted step by step into group housing systems. Recent research demonstrated that with semi-group housing systems much better performance levels are possible than with the Swiss group housing system. However, solutions to eliminate aggression, stress and injuries which are common among rabbit does in group housing systems have yet to be found. Some authors are of the opinion that individual cages are too small and allow limited possibilities for movement and social contact. Positive results were seen when platforms were inserted into the cages and the possibility for movement increased. The does and their kits could jump up and down using the platforms. Using footrests, the incidence of sore hocks declined. Several <b>environmental</b> <b>enrichments</b> which increase the well-being of rabbit does can also be used. These enriched cages (equipped with platforms, footrests, gnawing sticks, etc.) are fully in line with animal welfare requirements.

40|$|A {{traditional}} fox cage was {{furnished with}} both activating <b>environmental</b> <b>enrichments</b> (EE) (a bone, a scratching plate, a hockey buck, a ceiling rope and a wall rope and straw) and EEs enabling rest-ing or observation (a wire-mesh platform {{and a top}} nest box). The aim was to find out to which extent blue foxes (Vulpes lagopus) utilized these EEs, and to collect practical experiences of the EEs. The experimental animals were 12 adult blue fox vixens that had been housed in cages furnished with a platform and a bone for about 1. 5 years before they were transferred to the multi-enriched cages. The frequency and duration of the active contacts with the EEs were measured with conti-nuous recording on Days 1, 2, 7 and 16 after the transfer, with three hours (13 : 30 - 14 : 30, 18 : 00 - 19 : 00 and 2 : 00 - 3 : 00) on each day. The total use of the EEs was 15 times per hour and more than 20 % of the time. For most EEs both the time spent in contact {{and the frequency of}} contacts with the EEs declined steeply after Day 1, reflecting a novelty effect of the EEs. This decline was not so evident for the platform, top nest box and wall rope. These three EEs were also the ones used the most by the foxes.

Here, we present metagenomic and metaproteomic characterization of a previously described biocathode biofilm (+ 310 mV versus a standard hydrogen electrode [SHE]) enriched from seawater, reducing O_ 2, and presumably fixing CO_ 2 for biomass generation. Metagenomics identified 16 distinct cluster genomes, 15 of which could be assigned at the family or genus level and whose abundance was roughly divided between Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria. A total of 644 proteins were identified from shotgun metaproteomics and have been deposited in the the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD 001045. Cluster genomes were used to assign the taxonomic identities of 599 proteins, with Marinobacter, Chromatiaceae, and Labrenzia the most represented. RubisCO and phosphoribulokinase, along with 9 other Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle proteins, were identified from Chromatiaceae. In addition, proteins similar to those predicted for iron oxidation pathways of known iron-oxidizing bacteria were observed for Chromatiaceae.

40|$|Wild {{carnivores}} in zoos, conservation breeding centres, {{and farms}} commonly live in relatively small, unstimulating enclosures. Under these captive conditions, {{in a range}} of species including giant pandas, black-footed ferrets, and European mink, male reproductive abilities are often poor. Such problems have long been hypothesized to be caused by these animals' housing conditions. We show {{for the first time that}} rearing under welfare-improving (i. e., highly valued and stress-reducing) <b>environmental</b> <b>enrichments</b> enhances male carnivores' copulatory performance: in mate choice competitions, enriched male American mink (Neovison vison) mated more often than non-enriched males. We screened for several potential mediators of this effect. First was physiological stress and its impact on reproductive physiology; second, stress-mediated changes in morphology and variables related to immunocompetence that could influence male attractiveness; and third, behavioural changes likely to affect social competence, particularly autistic-like excessive routine and repetition ('perseveration') as is reflected in the stereotypies common in captive animals. Consistent with physiological stress, excreted steroid metabolites revealed that non-enriched males had higher cortisol levels and lower androgen levels than enriched conspecifics. Their os penises (bacula) also tended to be less developed. Consistent with reduced attractiveness, non-enriched males were lighter, with comparatively small spleens and a trend to greater fluctuating asymmetry. Consistent with impaired social competence, non-enriched males performed more stereotypic behaviour (e. g., pacing) in their home cages. Of all these effects, the only significant predictor of copulation number was stereotypy (a trend suggesting that low bodyweights may also be influential) : highly stereotypic males gained the fewest copulations. The neurophysiological changes underlying stereotypy thus handicap males sexually. We hypothesise that such males are abnormally perseverative when interacting with females. Investigating similar problems in other taxa would be worthwhile, since many vertebrates, wild and domestic, live in conditions that cause stereotypic behaviour and/or impair neurological development...|$|R

This study involved 433 participants (66. 7 % female), aged 50 - 79 years (M = 62. 16, SD = 6. 81). A measure of CR was established through a principal components analysis (PCA) of THBP study variables (WTAR IQ, prior education and the Lifetime of Experiences Questionnaire) previously shown to contribute to the construct. Composite variables of episodic memory, working memory, executive function and language processing were also derived through PCA, with the component accounting for the largest proportion of variance retained to represent that domain. Multivariate regression analyses then assessed the main and interaction effects for predictors: age; CR; APOE; and BDNF, for each cognitive domain separately. Results. This analysis demonstrated that: (1) CR was positively associated with each cognitive domain (p <. 05) while age was negatively associated with each cognitive domain (p <. 05), excluding language processing, (2) individual APOE and BDNF predictors were not associated with performance in any cognitive domain, (3) BDNF moderated the association between CR and executive function performance, in that BDNF Met carriers had a significantly reduced association when compared to Val homozygotes (p <. 05). Conclusions. This study has shown that CR is associated with cognitive function in healthy older adults. In addition, BDNF Met carriers demonstrated a reduced ability to generate or access CR resources when compared to BDNF Met non-carriers with respect to executive function...|$|R
