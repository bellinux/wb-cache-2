5|$|In a {{long-lived}} {{bird with}} a small clutch size such as the Atlantic puffin, the survival rate of adults {{is an important factor}} influencing the success of the species. Only 5% of the ringed puffins that failed to reappear at the colony did so during the breeding season. The rest were lost some time between departing from land in the summer and reappearing the following spring. The birds spend the winter widely spread out in the open ocean, though there is a tendency for individuals from different colonies to overwinter <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>areas.</b> Little is known of their behaviour and diet at sea but no correlation was found between environmental factors, such as temperature variations, and their mortality rate. A combination of the availability of food in winter and summer probably influences the survival of the birds, since individuals starting the winter in poor condition are less likely to survive than those in good condition.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus, a {{widespread}} genus of bats in Africa, southern Eurasia, and Australia, was first recorded from Madagascar by George Edward Dobson, who mentioned the larger Miniopterus schreibersii {{and the smaller}} M.scotinus (currently M.natalensis) in his 1878 catalog of the bats in the British Museum. In 1906, Oldfield Thomas named the larger species M.majori and the smaller M.manavi. He regarded M.manavi {{as close to the}} mainland African M.minor, and in 1971, R.W. Hayman and J.E. Hill placed it as a subspecies of that species. In their 1995 Faune de Madagascar review of Malagasy bats, however, Randolph Peterson and colleagues again separated M.manavi as a species, with M.manavi griveaudi (currently Miniopterus griveaudi) from Grande Comore as a subspecies. Peterson, who died before the review was completed, had originally divided M.manavi into several species occurring <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>areas,</b> but his collaborators decided conservatively to keep M.manavi as a single species, recommending reassessment of the status of those forms as new material would become available.|$|E
