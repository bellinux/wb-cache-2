500|$|In a {{significant}} {{scene in the}} book, Harry sees a memory of his own father humiliating Snape in their school days, and Snape insulting his mother after she stood up for him. In the film, it is abbreviated to an [...] "idea", in Goldenberg's words. [...] "It's an iconic moment when you realise your parents are normal, flawed human beings. ... Things get trimmed out, but <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> meat of that in there – {{and that was what}} really gave me the coming-of-age story." [...] Young Lily Potter did not appear at all, but promotional screenshots show unknown teenager Susie Shinner in the role.|$|E

[...] In 2014, Lewis told biographer Rick Bragg [...] "Oh, man, {{that was a big}} monster record" [...] but that the record company [...] "never paid me a penny." [...] Speaking to Patrick Doyle of Rolling Stone in 2014, Lewis remained proud that he [...] "stuck with rock & roll when the rest of them didn't, <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> ball rollin' with that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Maggie {{debuted in}} 2002. Hendrickson, at first, had a {{difficult}} time differentiating her from Frankie. [...] "Oh, my gosh, I was so afraid about that," [...] she said. [...] "I was trying to go for something completely different, but the problem was that the writers left it so ambiguous; the character was such a blank slate. I just decided to make her lighter, prettier [...] <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> humor; I always like to play a little bit of humor. And I was playing her straight [...] at first ! So I went for heterosexual, pretty, funny. And smarter!" ...|$|E

2500|$|A gift of {{businessman}} William Hills, the car {{was dedicated}} in Saratoga, New York, on May 25, 1894. [...] Hills placed one condition on his gift: that matching funds to build a fourth chapel car be raised {{before the end of}} the year. The first missionaries for the car, the Rusts, were newlyweds at the time of their assignment. [...] Two of their five children were born on Glad Tidings. [...] The car traveled in the Midwestern states and territories served by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. [...] In 1905, the Rusts left chapel car work and Glad Tidings was turned over to chapel car missionaries serving in Colorado, Wyoming and Arizona. [...] Various restrictions, including those of World War <b>I,</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> car in Douglas, Wyoming, for the years 1915 through 1919. Because it had been sidelined for a period of years, {{the car was}} sent for some needed maintenance in 1920 before being assigned to a new Arizona route.|$|E
2500|$|We flew at 13,440 feet (4,800 meters) {{above sea}} level and our speed was 540 knots. [...] A little bit after {{completing}} a turn to the northwest, we identified a patrol of four MiG-21s in spread formation {{at a distance of}} 5 miles –about 8 km- at ‘2 o’clock’ and below us. Two more MiGs appeared 2 miles –about 3 km - behind[...] [...] [...] When the MiGs crossed in front of Stone, he started to follow, breaking left and losing height. Due to that, the flight spread wide to the right, and I found myself higher and somewhat {{to the right of the}} others. <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> throttle to the minimum during the first phase of the combat. So, when the MiGs broke to the left, and the engagement began. I chose one of the MiGs and followed him with my radar. I don't think that we ever exceeded 4G's during the whole engagement. I decided to follow the Navy pilots' tactics - at close range foregoing the radar tracking, but looking through the reticle instead. When I realized that I was in the right position, I pushed the fire button, released it, pushed it again, and waited. I did not even see the first Sparrow. However, I followed the entire trajectory of the second one, from launch to impact. I fired the missiles at less than 2,000 yards from the MiG’s tail, at a height of 9,800 feet (3,500 meters) while turning to the left. The second one hit the tail section of the enemy aircraft. A second later, I saw a huge, orange ball of fire.|$|E
