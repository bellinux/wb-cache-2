25|$|La risata (1911, The Laugh) is {{considered}} his first truly Futurist work. He had fully parted with Divisionism, and now {{focused on the}} sensations derived from his observation of modern life. Its public reception was quite negative, compared unfavorably with Three Women, and it was defaced by a visitor, running <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> the still fresh paint. Subsequent criticism became more positive, with some considering the painting a response to Cubism. It was purchased by Albert Borchardt, a German collector who acquired 20 Futurist works exhibited in Berlin, including The Street Enters the House (1911) which depicts a woman on a balcony overlooking a busy street. Today the former also {{is owned by the}} Museum of Modern Art, and the latter by the Sprengel Museum in Hanover.|$|E
2500|$|Consistently {{cited as}} one of football's meanest, toughest, and most feared players, Butkus was renown for his intimidating profile and style of play. He was known to snarl at the {{opposition}} prior to plays. Quarterbacks would complain of Butkus biting them in pileups. Lions tight end Charlie Sanders recalled Butkus poking him in the eyes with <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> his face mask. He once intercepted a pass from Vikings quarterback Fran Tarkenton near the goal line, and instead of taking {{the ball into the}} end zone for an easy touchdown, he took aim at Tarkenton to run him over. When asked by a reporter if he was as the rumors suggested, he replied, [...] "I'm not so mean. I wouldn't ever go out to hurt anybody deliberately. Unless it was, you know, important—like a league game or something." ...|$|E
60|$|His {{companion}} {{raised his}} hat, and ran <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> his hair.|$|E
60|$|He {{crouched}} down and carefully put <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>through</b> the thorns into the round {{door of the}} nest.|$|R
60|$|David frowned dubiously {{and poked}} <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>through</b> the hole which {{represented}} {{the eye of}} the king of beasts.|$|R
60|$|Charlie {{tried to}} laugh, but 'e {{made such a}} queer noise that young Bill made a large blot on 'is exercise-book, and old Cook, wot was {{lighting}} his pipe, burnt <b>'is</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> not looking wot 'e was doing.|$|R
60|$|He started, and ran <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> his rough hair in an overwrought manner.|$|E
60|$|Morris ran <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> his untidy {{hair and}} opened his lips to answer.|$|E
60|$|And Adolph {{tossed his}} head, and passed <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> his scented hair, with a grace.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] he demanded. [...] "It's {{about your}} size, comfortable, {{and all the}} air you want" [...] (here Mr. Cooke stuck <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>through</b> the bit hole). [...] "Damn me, if I were in your fix, I wouldn't stop at a kennel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{a village}} called Allington, certainly. It lies over there." [...] And Johnny pointed with <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>through</b> the window. [...] "As {{you do not}} know the country you can see nothing, but I can see the Allington trees at this moment." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{felt that}} he would never {{understand}} a woman. But <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> wandered <b>through</b> her tobacco-coloured hair.|$|R
60|$|Poor old Corky ran <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> {{his hair}} in a temperamental sort of way. He groaned.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Perkins, slowly {{dragging}} <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> his beard, {{looked at}} him thoughtfully. He seemed to speak almost to himself.|$|E
60|$|The German seemed bewildered; he ran <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> his bushy hair as {{if trying}} to {{remember}} what he had said.|$|E
60|$|For {{an instant}} Mr. Tiernan stood silent before her, his legs apart, <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> running <b>through</b> <b>his</b> bristly hair.|$|R
5000|$|In Rockets and People, {{scientist}} and historian Boris Chertok recounted how Voskresenskiy reacted when a missile being tested developed a leak of a supposedly radioactive substance. As others rushed away, he calmly {{walked up to}} the rocket and climbed the gantry. He ran <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>through</b> the liquid, and {{in full view of the}} launch crew, put <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> on <b>his</b> tongue to demonstrate that the substance was harmless. He then called on everyone to return to work.|$|R
60|$|Philip waited. Mr. Perkins ran <b>his</b> lean <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> {{beard and}} looked at Philip. He seemed to be {{thinking}} over {{what he wanted to}} say.|$|R
60|$|The young pugilist, {{who had a}} curious, lanky figure, and a craggy, bony face, passed <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> his {{close-cropped}} hair.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Good-evening, sir,' said Mr Folair, {{taking off}} the tall hat, and running <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> his hair. 'I bring a communication. Hem!' ...|$|E
60|$|At {{this point}} Mr. Kipps rubbed <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> his hair with an {{expression}} of some perplexity {{and went back to the}} beginning.|$|E
6000|$|Beginning, {{from the}} mere force of habit, some half-delirious {{reference}} to the weather, Edwin suddenly stopped, passed <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> wildly <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair, and again said, with deep earnestness,--"Emma." ...|$|R
6000|$|Though closer {{still the}} blinds we pull [...] To keep the shady parlour cool, [...] Yet {{he will find}} a chink or two [...] To slip <b>his</b> golden <b>fingers</b> <b>through.</b>|$|R
6000|$|For {{the moment}} he did not answer her at all, but sat facing the fire, and running <b>his</b> fat <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> uncombed hair. [...] "Mrs. Smiley!" [...] he said; [...] "I {{remember}} when she was kitchen-maid at old Pott's." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] resumed the doctor, passing <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> Briant's matted locks, [...] "I suppose you're not so combative {{as we had}} fancied--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know, Doris, {{you look}} like the {{pictures}} of Louise de Kerouaille." [...] He passed <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> a mass of curly hair.|$|E
60|$|He stopped, and ran <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> his hair, in all directions; his {{features}} fidgetting and distorting themselves ominously, while {{he looked at}} me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Friend!" [...] {{said the}} youth, lifting a cap of skins from his head, and running <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> leisurely <b>through</b> a dense mass {{of black and}} shaggy locks, [...] "if I have ever laid eyes on the girl before to-night, may I--" ...|$|R
50|$|Sir Henry, {{like most}} courtiers of the day, had a {{portrait}} painted by a leading artist. In Lee's picture, his sleeves {{are decorated with}} armillary spheres, a symbol of wisdom and also his device as queen's champion. His sleeves are also decorated with lovers knots which, combined with the armillary spheres {{can be seen to}} represent his love for learning (the wisdom of the armillary spheres) and for the Queen (his symbol as her champion). Lee also wears several rings tied to his arm, and has <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>through</b> a third ring around his neck. This may represent his marriages, and the third ring, which is not quite on <b>his</b> <b>finger,</b> may represent <b>his</b> relationship with Anne Vavasour.|$|R
60|$|Philip did not answer. Mr. Perkins, holding himself oddly as {{he always}} did, like a figure in one of Perugino's pictures, drew <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> thoughtfully <b>through</b> <b>his</b> beard. He looked at Philip {{as though he were}} trying to {{understand}} and then abruptly told him he might go.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} said that other was the road to Butterfield," [...] said he, running <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> his shaggy {{whiskers}} in a puzzled way.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could see}} it come! I {{could see it}} come!" [...] he exclaimed, passing <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> his hair with the same perplexed {{expression}} as before.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's your report. You'd better {{see what}} it says," [...] he remarked, as he ran <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> the wrapper of a {{catalogue}} of second-hand books.|$|E
60|$|As {{soon as it}} {{was dark}} father and {{son-in-law}} launched Pili’s boat and set the sail. There was a great sea, and it blew strong from the leeward; but the boat was swift and light and dry, and skimmed the waves. The wizard had a lantern, which he lit and held with <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>through</b> the ring; and the two sat in the stern and smoked cigars, of which Kalamake had always a provision, and spoke like friends of magic and the great sums of money which they could make by its exercise, and what they should buy first, and what second; and Kalamake talked like a father.|$|R
50|$|William Kemley {{was said}} to have saved the life of Ramsay in battle, by holding a flag over his body. In doing so he {{suffered}} a wound from a musket ball that left him with a permanent hole {{in the palm of his}} hand. His grandson, Peter Gordon Kemley, used to tell how he could put <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>through</b> the palm of his grandfather's hand. For his actions, William Kemley was given a house on the Dalhousie Estate at Brechin Castle, rent-free for life. His daughter, Caroline Kemley, was born under a gun carriage the evening before the Battle of Quatre Bras. Her mother was one of six wives per regiment permitted to accompany their husbands.|$|R
60|$|Spike sat up, groaning. Equipped {{though he}} was by nature with a skull of the purest and most solid ivory, the fall had disconcerted him. His eyes, like those of Shakespeare's poet, rolling in a fine frenzy, did glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven. He passed <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> tenderly <b>through</b> <b>his</b> {{vermilion}} hair.|$|R
