5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} left of the Bastille except some remains of its stone {{foundation}} that were relocated to the side of Boulevard Henri IV.

5|$|Mephedrone {{has been}} <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{death of a}} 22-year-old male, who had also {{injected}} black tar heroin. Mephedrone was found in his blood at a concentration of 0.50mg/L and in his urine at a concentration of 198mg/L. The blood concentration of morphine, a metabolite of heroin, was 0.06mg/L. For comparison, the average blood morphine concentration resulting from deadly overdoses involving only heroin is around 0.34mg/L.|$|E
5|$|Not all {{interactions}} {{between humans and}} cattle egrets are beneficial.

5|$|A {{man from}} Northern Ireland was {{discussed}} in the media {{in connection with the}} disappearance. After being released from prison for the sexual assault of his four daughters, he had moved to Carvoeiro, Portugal, not far from Praia da Luz, and was there when Madeleine went missing. He died in 2013. Another focus of Operation Grange was Urs Hans von Aesch, a deceased Swiss man <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2007 murder, in Switzerland, of five-year-old Ylenia Lenhard. Ylenia disappeared on 31 July 2007, nearly three months after Madeleine, and was found dead in September as a result of toluene poisoning.

5|$|Both {{civilian}} and military authorities considered the Wehrmachtbericht to be a vital instrument of German home-front mobilisation, the civilian contribution to the German war effort, especially after the defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad. According to historians Wolfram Wette and Daniel Uziel, the final 9 May 1945 communiqué {{laid the foundation for}} the myth of the clean Wehrmacht, the notion that the Wehrmacht had fought honourably and was not <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crimes of the Nazi regime, for which (according to the myth) only the SS bore responsibility.|$|E
5|$|Disturbance {{has been}} <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{formation}} of vegetation dominated by large Attalea species. In seasonally dry Amazonian forests {{the density of}} large adult A.maripa palms was correlated with canopy openness; the species also dominates savannas formed by repeated forest fires in Trinidad and Tobago. Attalea speciosa forms pure stands {{in many parts of}} Brazil where natural forest vegetation has been cleared. Similarly, stands of A.funifera in Bahia, Brazil (which are cultivated for piassava fibre) are managed using fire—the seedlings survive cutting and burning, and are able to dominate burned forest patches.|$|E

Model was well aware of Speidel's political leanings, as were his predecessors at Army Group B, Erwin Rommel and Günther von Kluge. Like them, he shielded Speidel for as long as possible, while ignoring such treasonous talk as might take place.|$|E

25|$|Bohm {{discussed}} {{the experience of}} listening to music. He believed the feeling of movement and change that make up our experience of music derive from holding the immediate past and <b>the</b> present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brain together. The musical notes from the past are transformations rather than memories. The notes that were <b>implicate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> immediate past become explicate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> present.

5|$|Gambier {{continued}} in command until 1811, and remained in service {{until his death}} in 1833. Cochrane was disgraced and refused further service, choosing semi-retirement to pursue his political ambitions.

He resigned his commission and joined first the Chilean Navy and then the Brazilian Navy, before becoming commander of the Greek Navy during the Greek War of Independence. He was restored to the Royal Navy with a royal pardon in 1832 and died in 1860, shortly after publishing an autobiography which furiously castigated the participants in the events 51 years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Grown {{in liquid}} culture, Crucibulum laeve {{produces}} bioactive chemicals called salfredins that are structurally related to benzofuran and chromene, molecules that contain cyclic amide or lactone five-membered ring structures; these compounds {{are unique to}} this species. Salfredin B11 was first identified in 1995, while later research confirmed the presence of additional salfredin-type metabolites. These compounds are inhibitors of aldose reductase, an enzyme that has been <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> formation of cataracts in advanced stages of diabetes mellitus.
