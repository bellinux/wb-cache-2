500|$|Thompson has {{heavily criticized}} {{a number of}} video games and campaigned against their {{producers}} and distributors. His basic argument is that violent video games have repeatedly been used by teenagers as [...] "murder simulators" [...] to rehearse violent plans. He has pointed to alleged connections between such games {{and a number of}} school massacres. According to Thompson, [...] "In every school shooting, we find that kids who pull the trigger are video gamers." [...] Also, he claims that scientific studies show teenagers process the game environment differently from adults, leading to increased violence and copycat behavior. According to Thompson, [...] "If some wacked-out adult wants to spend his time playing , one <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> why he doesn't get a life, {{but when it comes to}} kids, it has a demonstrable impact on their behavior and the development of the frontal lobes of their brain." [...] Thompson has described the proliferation of games by Sony, a Japanese company, as [...] "Pearl Harbor 2". According to Thompson, [...] "Many parents think that stores won’t sell an M-rated game to someone under 17. We know that's not true, and, in fact, kids roughly 50 percent of that time, all the studies show, are able to walk into any store and get any game regardless of the rating, no questions asked." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{praise from}} critics. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode an [...] "A–", noting that [...] "one <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> {{to what extent}} this episode is intended as information, {{and to what extent}} sheer entertainment". Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club spoke positively of the episode, saying [...] "I love this ... and watching it now, I still do". He ultimately gave the episode an [...] "A" [...] and wrote, [...] "'Musings' is great because it transforms CSM from a living ghost into the walking dead—still horrifying, still dangerous, but pitiable just the same". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, named the episode [...] "one of The X-Files true masterpieces" [...] and awarded it five stars out of five. The two praised Morgan and Wong's combination of mythological story elements with more dry and dark humor. Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson wrote positively of the ambiguousness of the episode's authenticity, noting that [...] "the answers that the viewers are craving are handed out here on such a large plate, you can only take them as a delicious parody." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a glowing review and awarded it four stars out of four. She praised the way that the viewer is able to see the [...] "barren emotional landscape in which the Cigarette Smoking Man dwells" [...] via the [...] "tone of the script". Furthermore, Vitaris applauded the Forrest Gump-esque rant, calling it [...] "a comic high point of verbal venom".|$|E
2500|$|Another {{timeline}} {{problem is}} that critics claim that too much happened between the filming (at 1:15 at the earliest) and the filmmakers' arrival in Willow Creek (at 6:30 at the latest). Daegling wrote, [...] "All {{of the problems with}} the timeline disappear if the film is shot a few days or hours beforehand. If that is the case, one <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> what other details of this story are wrong." [...] The film's defenders retort that although the time window was tight, it was do-able.|$|E

2500|$|Thurman filmed a brief role in {{the fantasy}} {{adaptation}} [...] (2010), appearing as Medusa, a gorgon cursed by Athena. In 2011, {{she was a member}} of the jury for the main competition at the Cannes Film Festival, and her only film in the year —Ceremony— was released for VOD and selected theaters. In the independent comedy, she starred as woman on the eve of her wedding who re-connects with an old fling (played by Michael Angarano). Writing for the New York Daily News, Elizabeth Weitzman was critical of Thurman's role and noted: [...] "She gets stuck in so many small, undeserving projects, one <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> who's mapping out her career".|$|E
2500|$|According to Alfred Kazin, {{who knew}} him, Weldon Kees’s {{ambition}} {{as a poet}} knew no bounds. He “desperately wanted to be famous”, says Kazin, “to be ’up there’, {{as he used to}} say, with Eliot, Pound and other stars in our firmament". This being so, one <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> why Weldon was not more of a hustler on his own behalf. So far as we know, he seems to have done very {{little in the way of}} careerist self-advancement—although, to judge from photographs, he was by no means short of vanity. Arrogant, embittered and melancholic, he waited for acclaim to come to him, but none of the three books he published in his lifetime made much of a mark. (One commentator has estimated that Kees sold a total of 1,000 copies of his works before he disappeared.) ...|$|E
6000|$|Anton, {{being more}} a {{businessman}} than a lover, at times behaves insensitively toward Nina. Otherwise, throughout the novel, the Jewish characters act with honesty and kindness. Even the Jewish maiden {{who wants to}} marry Anton does not scheme to break up his engagement to Nina but rather befriends Nina and eventually saves her life. One <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> whether Trollope intended this contrast to induce his readers to reconsider their prejudices. Consider his perception of his duty as a writer: ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I'd {{stumbled}} {{into the middle of}} an evil, insidious cult of chainsaw worshipping maniacs. I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> if we'd let our religious freedom go too far in this country, or maybe our immigration laws were just too lax." ...|$|R

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow and Thom Jurek awarded the albums 4½ stars stating [...] "as a whole, this {{recording}} is so wonderfully executed, one <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> why Hipp simply {{dropped out of}} the jazz world".|$|E
5000|$|Upper Silesia {{was known}} to be a poor, but heavily industrialised and {{polluted}} area. This was one of the Areas that P. G. Wodehouse was sent to after he was captured in the South of France as an Enemy Alien. He was said to have commented {{on the state of the}} area [...] "If this is Upper Silesia, one <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> what Lower Silesia is like." ...|$|E
5000|$|Mr Regan also {{commented on}} the actions of ANZ Bank. He said that ANZ's {{decision}} to foreclose on the loan a week after issuing it {{raised questions about the}} bank's motives. [...] "One <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> whether the ANZ Bank's loss of appetite for continued support {{had anything to do with}} the fact that they had got the long sought-after change to the AMSLA (Australian Master Securities Lending Agreement) on March 20." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{his book}} ‘Behind the Dream’ Jordan wrote (p. 161): “that great welling of {{national}} passion was extraordinary {{to see and}} you <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> what bed Ally was making for himself by saying {{that we were going}} to win the World Cup, especially when you thought of all the European teams who <b>had</b> gone <b>to</b> South America without success”.|$|R

5000|$|Weeks {{before the}} announcement, PopMatters {{magazine}} wrote, [...] "One <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> {{how long it}} will be before we hear the inevitable [...] "the industry ate me up" [...] stories from Vanessa Carlton. Perhaps when this record fails to outsell her debut and A&M drops her?". The Herald & Review said that Carlton [...] "became another one of the new millennium’s poster children for what happens when music labels are taken over by accountants and artist development is abandoned." ...|$|E
50|$|One <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder,</b> if {{politics}} {{played a}} significant role in this decision. The majority in the government (but minority of the Regia Marina) favored development of capital ships, so allocated resources went mainly into this area, including unnecessary rebuilding of old era heavy cruisers, or extending their service, but reducing financing to scientific and technical developments, and production of ammunition. In 1935 Albatros was reclassified as a second-line ship, and was assigned to Regia Marina's naval experimental unit at La Spezia.|$|E
50|$|The novel closes with a {{confused}} account of Vigdís being discovered wandering {{naked in the}} highlands, the police investigating events at the 'house', and Vigdís's hospitalisation. Yet it also appears at this stage {{that the house was}} in fact a large rock; 'thereupon the reader <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> whether everything that goes on in between car-crash and the ending was only hallucinations, triggered by the consumption of alcohol and drugs, but above all by the powerful impulse to self-destruction which the four young people experience'.|$|E
5000|$|Regarding [...] "Crack in the Pearl pt. II", Ronson {{admitted}} that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> bring <b>Wonder</b> [...] "one more time!".|$|R
5000|$|The album mostly had {{positive}} reviews. Hardrock Haven gave the album a 9.5/10, saying, [...] "When you hear something this good, you don’t want <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> about 'what could have been' ever again." [...] Amazon.com gave the album 4.5/5, calling the album [...] "a record {{that goes back}} to the roots of the 'classic' Black 'N Blue sound, mixing tight and hard rocking songs with a sleazy attitude." ...|$|R
5000|$|Reviewing the 2011 festival, Malcolm Jack of The Guardian {{described}} the artists as [...] "so obscure you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> if they've {{even heard of}} themselves". He writes, [...] "Indietracks does little to dispel the notion of indie-pop fans being given to whimsy. It's the annual gathering of the twee tribe - think lovers of a broad church of outsider sounds from C86-inspired three-chord shambling to riot grrrl and anti-folk." ...|$|R

5000|$|... "One <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> that if {{time and}} money can be found to remodel a home, send kids to {{exclusive}} private schools, purchase commercial property and run your own business... maybe money can be found for other things," [...] the blogger wrote. [...] "Maybe Dad should drop his woodworking hobby and get a real job that offers health insurance rather than making people like me (also with 4 kids in a 600sf smaller house and tuition $16,000 less per kid and no commercial property ownership) pay for it in my taxes." ...|$|E
5000|$|Consequence of Sound critic Frank Mojica {{stated that}} [...] "Lost in Translation is {{renowned for its}} soundtrack, and the music serves as the third star of the picture." [...] On the film's {{possible}} legacy, Mojica also wrote: [...] "One <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> {{how much of a}} role the film and its soundtrack had in the rebirth of shoegaze in the mid ’00s. After all, My Bloody Valentine eventually reformed, as did The Jesus and Mary Chain, with the latter performing with none other than Scarlett Johansson at their Coachella reunion." ...|$|E
5000|$|With {{an album}} this outstanding, we don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> much about what's {{in store for}} Jonah Tolchin. It's safe to say {{there will be many}} more thousand-mile nights in his future as he takes these songs across the country and around the world, {{bringing}} beauty and truth and silver linings wherever he goes, [...] "driving all night," [...] as he sings, [...] "on a little bit of faith." ...|$|R
2500|$|When {{questioned}} on {{the importance}} that he attaches to this number, Drummond has been evasive, responding enigmatically [...] "I know. But I'm not going to tell, because then other people would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> stop <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> and the thing about beauty is for other people <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> at it. It's not very beautiful once you know." [...] Drummond's penchant for living by numbers has also been observed in his choosing to align the ages at which he undertook creative projects The Man and 45 with the standard revolution speeds of a turntable (33.3 and 45 rpm).|$|R
5000|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The New York Times film critic Stephen Holden called Noise [...] "a one-trick film that rapidly wears out its welcome." [...] Holden said the film [...] "is shallow and loud" [...] and [...] "lurches unsteadily between drama and comedy." [...] Holden wrote [...] "Its performances are discordant" [...] and said [...] "you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>to</b> what degree Mr. Robbins, an actor {{famous for his}} political activism, is here simply because he shares Mr. Bean's outrage." ...|$|R
5000|$|Her {{inclusion}} is both memorable {{and kind}} of awkward. I mean, look at her. She’s got this whole sinister, sultry Jessica Rabbit thing going on in a game made in the overly-kiddy Nintendo era, back when they wouldn’t even let blood in their Mortal Kombat port. When you’re a kid in the early 90s {{and you have a}} buxom dominatrix-type dressing you down after every level while wearing only a leather one-piece and a cape, part of you <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder,</b> “Wait, am I even allowed to be playing this?” Gavin Jasper, Den of Geek ...|$|E
5000|$|Doug Ramsey {{reviewed}} the album for Jazz Times and wrote that [...] "It catches the quartet in as fine fettle...The empathy, the tightness, {{the ability to}} anticipate that this band had developed in nearly a decade together was at its peak. [...] "Mr. Broadway," [...] at a furious clip, is pure exhiliration. The listener <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> at Wright's and Morello's cohesiveness, let alone their continued swing, under Brubeck's fragmentation of meter in his solo. There is a [...] "Koto Song" [...] with Desmond again proving himself a blues master and Brubeck as delicate as a French impressionist. ...This was an impressive group. Seven months later, Brubeck disbanded it".|$|E
5000|$|The album {{received}} a mixed reception from critics, with reviewers criticizing {{the lack of}} songs and [...] "Cash grab" [...] nature of the album. Allmusic's Steve Huey called the album [...] "a lower-priced, ten-track sampler of Alice in Chains' career." [...] Bill Adams of Ground Control Magazine questioned {{the integrity of the}} album, writing in his review [...] "one <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> who this compilation was made for. When it was released in 2001, Alice in Chains had only gone for about six years without a new studio album, and fans had been kept interested with live albums, box sets and myriad other releases, so why put out something so plainly utilitarian?".|$|E
5000|$|According to John Cassidy, {{staff writer}} at The New Yorker, Clinton, up to a point, took a populist tone: While {{many of you}} are working {{multiple}} jobs to make ends meet, you see the top twenty-five hedge-fund managers making more than all of America's kindergarten teachers combined. And often paying a lower tax rate. So, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder,</b> ‘When does my hard work pay off? When does my family get ahead? When?’ ...|$|R
5000|$|The film had {{a widely}} {{negative}} reception. Beyond Hollywood said [...] "the {{film is a}} complete loss, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> what the filmmakers could have done with a better script, a better cast, and a director who isn’t so hit-and-miss as to be infuriating." [...] Aaron Peck of Blog Critics said, [...] "I really wanted to like this movie. The first Scorpion King is a laugh-fest yes, but it’s fun to watch. This movie is painful." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I don't know! I {{got sick}} of the songs. When I would play them onstage, I was just like, 'Oh my gosh, I can't play these anymore.' And I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder,</b> was that album really who I was? Was I just experimenting with sounds? I think I wanted to try {{something}} more R&B, but when I tried that, it wasn't really me. And so with this album Demi, I'm so excited to play new music rather than getting tired of the songs".|$|R
