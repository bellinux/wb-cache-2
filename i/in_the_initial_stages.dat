40|$|Abstract The {{precipitation}} {{behavior of}} Mg and Si during storage at RT in Al-Mg-Si alloys pre-aged at 90 °C was studied using a tensile test and {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) measurement. Specimens were solutionized at 530 °C, water-quenched and then pre-aged for 2, 6 and 12 hours at 90 °C during which small precipitates were formed. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> pre-aged alloy, the strengthening rate at RT has two <b>stages.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>stage,</b> <b>the</b> yield strength increases slowly with the aging time and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final stage, it increases rapidly. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>stage,</b> <b>the</b> strength <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pre-aged alloy is smaller than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> non pre-aged alloy, while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final stage, <b>the</b> strength <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pre-aged alloy is larger than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> non pre-aged alloy. Furthermore, the period of <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>stage</b> {{is dependent on the}} pre-aging period at 90 °C. The DSC curves of alloys <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>stage</b> do not show the presence of clusters, while those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final stage do. It seems that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>stage</b> Mg and Si atoms accumulate around the small precipitates that have been formed in pre-aging at 90 °C while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final stage, the clusters of these atoms are formed...|$|R

5|$|On May 9, 1992, Armenian forces {{captured}} the mountain stronghold of Shusha but {{remained on the}} defensive until the next year.

However, nearly all offensives launched by Azerbaijan failed or could not hold on to captured territory. By the spring of 1993 the Azerbaijani military, which had the upper hand <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>stages</b> of the war, had been largely reduced to unorganized and incoherent fighting groups.

A higher proportion of males are affected compared to females. An uncommon but severe breed-specific skin condition, hyperplastic dermatosis, may affect West Highland White Terriers, both juveniles and adults dogs.

5|$|Up to this point, Brownwho was on {{his third}} tour of Englandhad scored 800 runs on tour {{at an average of}} 72.72, with a double century, three other centuries and 81 not out, In contrast, middle-order batsman Neil Harvey {{struggled}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>stages</b> of his first tour of England. Harvey failed to pass 25 in his first six innings, and although he had scored an unbeaten 100 against Sussex, he had totalled only 296 runs at 42.29. As a result, Brown gained selection in the First Test at Trent Bridge, batting out of position in the middle order while Barnes and Morris opened, whereas Harvey was dropped despite making a century in Australia's most recent Test against India.|$|E

5|$|Sandgate was {{intended}} to defend a vulnerable point along the Kent cliffs, just west of Folkestone, where an enemy force could potentially land and make their way easily further inland.

Rarely, there may be cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin due to low oxygen levels), altered level of consciousness, a hyperresonant percussion note on examination of the affected side with reduced expansion and decreased movement, pain in the epigastrium (upper abdomen), displacement of the apex beat (heart impulse), and resonant sound when tapping the sternum. This is a medical emergency and may require immediate treatment without further investigations (see below).|$|E

5|$|Fighting in Eastern Europe {{began with}} the first Austro-Hungarian {{invasion}} of Serbia in early August 1914, {{under the command of}} Oskar Potiorek. The number of Austro-Hungarian troops assigned to the invasion was far smaller than the 308,000-strong force intended when war was declared. This was because {{a large portion of the}} Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army had moved to the Russian Front, reducing the number of troops involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>stages</b> of the invasion to approximately 200,000. On the other hand, the Serbs could muster some 450,000 men to oppose the Austro-Hungarians upon full mobilization. The main elements to face the Austro-Hungarians were the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and Užice armies, with a combined strength of approximately 180,000 men. The Serbian Army was commanded by Crown Prince Alexander, with the chief of the Serbian general staff, Radomir Putnik, who had commanded Serb forces in the Balkan Wars, as his deputy and de facto military leader. Petar Bojović, Stepa Stepanović, Pavle Jurišić Šturm and Miloš Božanović commanded the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and Užice armies, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In March, 1944, the {{division}} {{was transferred to}} the 71st Rifle Corps, where it would remain {{for the duration of the}} conflict. At about the same time, the 31st Army became part of the 3rd Belorussian Front. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>stages</b> of Operation Bagration, the front's immediate objective was the city of Orsha. The 331st had the direct support of the 959th SU Regiment (SU-76s) for its initial assault; this regiment had been assigned to support of the corps since the beginning of June. In recognition of the 331st's role in the liberation of Orsha, on June 27, it was awarded the Order of Suvorov, 2nd Class. The division went on to assist in the liberation of Borisov. While two divisions of the 8th Guards Rifle Corps of the 11th Guards Army attacked from the west and north, the 331st drove into the south of the city and it was cleared of German forces by 3:00 am on July 1. In the following days it took part in the liberation of Minsk, before joining the general advance to the 1941 Soviet-German frontier. In recognition of his successful command of {{the division}} in this operation, Major General Berestov was awarded the Gold Star of the Hero of the Soviet Union on June 27, 1945.|$|E
5|$|In any case, Brown {{had done}} enough to be chosen to tour England with the Invincibles in 1948, {{although}} Barnes and Morris were the first-choice opening combination. Brown made a strong start in the tour matches preceding the Tests. In the fifth fixture, which was against Cambridge University, Brown top-scored with 200 in an innings victory. In the following match against Essex, Brown combined with Bradman in a second-wicket partnership of 219 in 90 minutes, ending with 153 as Australia scored a world-record 721 runs in one day. Australia proceeded to another innings victory, and Brown completed his third century in as many innings with 108 against Oxford University. He preceded to add a fourth century {{in less than three}} weeks, with 122 against Nottinghamshire, and made an unbeaten 81 against Hampshire. In contrast, middle-order batsman Neil Harvey had struggled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>stages</b> of his first tour of England, failing to pass 25 in his first six innings.
