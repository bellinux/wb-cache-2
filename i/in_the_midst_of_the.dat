40|$|By {{the very}} nature of what they do as scientists, sociologists and anthropologists are {{necessarily}} always <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> other people. They are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> other people <b>the</b> way physicists are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> electrons and detectors, the way chemists are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> chemicals and test tubes, the way biologists are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> cells and frogs. Very often now, on account of developments in social studies of science since the late 1960 s, sociologists and anthropologists find – or rather plant – themselves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> other researchers. Sometimes, and sometimes annoyingly, they plant themselves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> other researchers while they are engaged in their research or related professional activities. Sometimes the sociologists and anthropologists are participants who contribute to the research agenda of their subjects; sometimes they observe and interview as non-participants. Given this reality of their work, sociologists and anthropologists can or must appear at least on occasion intruders, pricks of conscience, or moral entrepreneurs, and obstacles rather than facilitators of research. This role of ethnographer of science, however, has proven itself over and over {{to be a source of}} important new insights and understandings about the nature of scientific practice. They can, of course, at the same time serve as the consciousness as well as the conscience of the research group. I have planted myself in your midst in part to continue my empirical studies of scientific and engineering practice. The other reasons I am here have to do with my interests in social robotics per se as a sociologist of mind and thinking...|$|R
