The oil cooler {{is located in the}} valley of the engine block, underneath the cartridge oil filter set up. The sealed outer portion of the oil cooler is submerged in engine oil, with coolant flowing through the center passages. Over time, the oil cooler will develop small cracks in the aluminum tubes from the constant heating and cooling of the engine. This situation usually results in oil pushing it's way into the cooling system. The sludge created from the mixture of oil and coolant creates a high pressure environment in the <b>EGR</b> <b>cooler</b> (due to the viscosity change in the coolant), leading to cracking of the EGR cooler's coolant passages. Once the <b>EGR</b> <b>cooler</b> cracks, it begins to leak coolant into the intake system and is then routed into the engine's cylinders to be burnt. The burning of coolant in the cylinders then causes a steam buildup, thus increasing cylinder pressures and the stretching of the head bolts; which leads to head gasket failure. The early EGR coolers (2003-2004.5) were also susceptible to pre-mature failure without oil cooler issues, also resulting in head gasket failure.|$|E

40|$|Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) is a widely-known {{technique}} {{applied in}} internal combustion engines for controlling the combustion process and harmful emissions. The recirculation of gases {{can be achieved}} either by delivering burnt gases from upstream of the turbine to downstream of the compressor (short-route) or by taking the exhaust gas downstream the turbine and deliver upstream the compressor (long-route). Although long-route (LR) system is preferred for highly boosted engines due to the higher EGR availability at low engine speeds, it lacks a fast response time during transient performance compared to the short-route (SR) system. This paper examines the potentials of introducing an alternative EGR route which can be applied in two-stage boosted engines. The proposed Mid-Route (MR) EGR system, applied in a gasoline engine, combines {{the benefits of the}} LR and SR routes. The system provides high EGR rates at all engine speeds while the transport delay in the case of transient operation is relatively short. The potential of a hybrid EGR system combining MR and LR EGR is examined and various components’ (i. e. compressor, turbine and coolers) sizing and transient performance studies are performed to understand the trade-offs of the system. It was demonstrated that MR could provide high EGR particularly at high and low engine speeds. A combination of MR and LR EGR can provide maximum EGR rates at all speeds with a maximum fuel consumption penalty of 1. 4 % at engine speeds below 2, 500 rpm. The reduction in EGR response time was of the magnitude of 50 % while the faster EGR purging time combined with the smaller turbine implemented, dropped the load tip-in response time by 25 %.

At the same time emission legislation (mainly for NO, and particulate matter) becomes stricter, reducing their limit to extremely low values. One efficient method to control NO, {{in order to achieve}} future emissions limits is the use of rather high exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rates accompanied by increased boost pressure to avoid the negative impact on soot emissions. The method is based on the reduction of gas temperature level and O- 2 availability inside the combustion chamber, but unfortunately it has usually an adverse effect on soot emissions and brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc). The use of high EGR rates creates the need for <b>EGR</b> gas <b>cooling</b> in order to minimize its negative impact on soot emissions especially at high engine load were the EGR flow rate and exhaust temperature are high.

40|$|The {{exhaust gas}} {{recirculation}} (EGR) system has been widely used to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission, improve fuel economy and suppress knock by using the characteristics of charge dilution. However, previous {{studies have shown that}} as the EGR rate at a given engine operating condition increases, the combustion instability increases. The combustion instability increases cyclic variations resulting in the deterioration of engine performance and increasing hydrocarbon emissions. Therefore, the optimum EGR rate should be carefully determined in order to obtain the better engine performance and emissions. A thermodynamic cycle simulation of the four-stroke spark-ignition engine was used {{to determine the effects of}} EGR on engine performance, emission characteristics and second law parameters, considering combustion instability issues as EGR level increases. A parameter, called 'Fuel Fraction Burned,' was introduced as a function of the EGR percentage and used in the simulation to incorporate the combustion instability effects. A comprehensive parametric investigation was conducted to examine the effects of variations in EGR, load and speed for a 5. 7 liter spark-ignition automotive engine. Variations in the thermal efficiencies, brake specific NOx emissions, average combustion temperature, mean exhaust temperature, maximum temperature and relative heat transfer as functions of exhaust gas recycle were determined for both <b>cooled</b> and adiabatic <b>EGR</b> configurations. Also effects of variations in the load and speed on thermal efficiencies, relative heat transfers and destruction of availability due to combustion were determined for 0 % EGR and 20 % EGR cases with both cooled and adiabatic configurations. For both EGR configurations, thermal efficiencies first increase, reach a maximum at about 16 % EGR and then decrease as the EGR level increases. Thermal efficiencies are slightly higher for <b>cooled</b> <b>EGR</b> configuration than that for adiabatic configuration. Concentration of nitric oxide emissions decreases from about 2950 ppm to 200 ppm as EGR level increases from 0 % to 20 % for <b>cooled</b> <b>EGR</b> configuration.

Predictions made from the simulation were compared with some of the available experimental results. Predicted thermal efficiencies showed a similar trend when compared to the available experimental data.

Gasoline engine downsizing {{is one such}} technology {{at the forefront of}} improvements in fuel economy. As engine downsizing becomes more aggressive, normal engine operating points are moving into higher load regions, typically requiring over-fuelling to maintain exhaust gas temperatures within component protection limits and retarded ignition timings in order to mitigate knock and pre-ignition events. These two mechanisms are counterproductive, since the retarded ignition timing delays combustion, in turn raising exhaust gas temperature. A key process being used to inhibit the occurrence of these knock and pre-ignition phenomena is cooled exhaust gas recirculation (<b>EGR).</b> <b>Cooled</b> <b>EGR</b> lowers temperatures during the combustion process, reducing the possibility of knock, and can thus reduce or eliminate the need for over-fuelling. It has also been shown to reduce exhaust gas temperature and improve combustion efficiency through improved combustion phasing. This paper reviews data collected on ‘ULTRABOOST’, a collaborative research project which is co-funded by the Technology Strategy Board, the UK's innovation agency. The project is based on a prototype, heavily downsized 2. 0 L DISI engine running under controlled boost conditions, featuring low pressure or ‘long route’ EGR. This allows for the EGR feed gas to be fed from either pre- or post-catalyst sampling points. This paper will present data collected at equivalent operating conditions using both catalyzed and un-catalyzed exhaust gas to feed the EGR system. Some comparison of equivalent BMEP levels will be made {{but this is not the}} focus of the investigation. Current standards utilize a CO 2 ratio for EGR measurement, but the results presented highlight inaccuracies in this measurement method when repeatable test conditions for pre- and post-catalyst EGR routes are required due to the significant changes in gas composition pre- and post-catalyst. The test engine was artificially boosted utilizing a Combustion Air Handling Unit to simulate commercially available turbo-machinery, which allowed for the catalyst effects to be assessed in isolation. Results from the engine are presented for constant intake manifold pressure and constant EGR mass flow to highlight the effects of the EGR feed gas composition on a range of engine performance metrics...|$|R

The considered parameters are torque, brake power, speciﬁc fuel consumption and thermal efﬁciency as well as smoke opacity. A four-stroke water cooled direct injection (DI) diesel engine with naturally aspirated, Isuzu 4 JB 1, combined with <b>cooled</b> <b>EGR</b> system was used for conducting test with HPM-diesel blended fuels with ratio 0 / 100, 5 / 95, 10 / 90, and 15 / 85 on volume basis at the variation of engine loads in the range of 25...|$|R
