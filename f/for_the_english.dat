We used a supervised learning approach with SVM as the learning algorithm. The knowledge sources used include local collocations, parts-of-speech, and surrounding words. We gathered training examples from English-Chinese parallel corpora, SEMCOR, and DSO corpus.

5|$|Interest in {{producing}} an English-language version of Let the Right One In began in 2007 shortly {{before it was}} released to audiences.

Reeves was then signed to direct and write the screenplay. Reeves made several changes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>English</b> version such as altering the setting from Stockholm to New Mexico and renaming the lead characters. The film's producers stated that their intent was to keep the plot similar to the original, yet make it more accessible to a wider audience.

5|$|The {{rivalry between}} the House of Plantagenet's two cadet {{branches}} of York and Lancaster {{brought about the}} Wars of the Roses, a decades-long fight <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>English</b> succession, culminating in the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, when {{the reign of the}} Plantagenets and the English Middle Ages both met their end with the death of King Richard III. Henry VII, of Lancastrian descent, became king of England; two years later, he married Elizabeth of York, thus ending the Wars of the Roses, and giving rise to the Tudor dynasty. The Tudors worked to centralise English royal power, which allowed them to avoid {{some of the problems that}} had plagued the last Plantagenet rulers.

5|$|Hand {{possessed a}} gift <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>English</b> language, and his {{writings}} are admired as legal literature.
