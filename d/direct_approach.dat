During his time at 1UP the site developed a greater profile and stepped out of its sister publication's shadow, but Smith grew frustrated with the contemporary state of gaming news and what he considered manipulation of journalists and readers into accepting promotional material as news. In April 2007 he left 1UP to become a Bungie writer and co-host of the developer's podcast.|$|E

5|$|A {{challenge}} for future successful GWA {{study is to}} apply the findings {{in a way that}} accelerates drug and diagnostics development, including better integration of genetic studies into the drug-development process and a focus on the role of genetic variation in maintaining health as a blueprint for designing new drugs and diagnostics. Several studies have looked into the use of risk-SNP markers as a means of directly improving the accuracy of prognosis. Some have found that the accuracy of prognosis improves, while others report only minor benefits from this use. Generally, a problem with this <b>direct</b> <b>approach</b> is the small magnitudes of the effects observed. A small effect ultimately translates into a poor separation of cases and controls and thus only a small improvement of prognosis accuracy. An alternative application is therefore the potential for GWA studies to elucidate pathophysiology.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City's quarter-final {{was against}} Burnley of the Second Division. City {{took the lead}} early in the match {{following}} a solo goal by Tilson. In the second-half Burnley discarded their passing game in favour of a <b>direct</b> <b>approach,</b> and pressured the Manchester City goal. The City defence stood firm, and the match finished 1–0. City's opponents for the semi-final, held at Leeds Road, Huddersfield, were Derby County. Derby had two chances to score in the first half, but both were missed. A Manchester City counter-attack produced the opening goal, when Brook crossed and Toseland headed in. By midway through the second half Manchester City led by three goals. The second was scored by Tilson, a follow-up after an initial saved shot. McMullan scored the third after dribbling through the Derby defence. Derby mounted a late comeback. A goal by Howard Fabian reduced the deficit to two, and Sammy Crooks added a late second for Derby, {{but it was too}} late to affect the result of the match, which ended 3–2.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate {{stronghold of}} Vicksburg, Mississippi blocked {{the way for}} {{complete}} Union control of the Mississippi River, making its capture vital for the Union War effort. Grant's Army held western Tennessee with almost 40,000 troops available to fight. Grant was aggravated to learn that Lincoln authorized McClernand to raise a separate army for the purpose. Halleck ordered McClernand to Memphis, and placed him and his troops under Grant's authority. After Grant's army captured Holly Springs Grant planned to attack Vicksburg's front overland while Sherman would attack the fortress from the rear on the Mississippi River. However, Confederate cavalry raids on December 11 and 20 broke Union communications and recaptured Holly Springs, preventing Grant's and Sherman's armies from connecting. On December 29, a Confederate army led by Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton repulsed Sherman's <b>direct</b> <b>approach</b> ascending the bluffs to Vicksburg at Chickasaw Bayou. McClernand reached Sherman's army, assumed command, and independently of Grant led a campaign that captured Confederate Fort Hindman. During this time Grant incorporated fleeing African American slaves into the Union Army giving them protection and paid employment.|$|E

Other possible approaches are the Smith-Petersen <b>direct</b> anterior <b>approach</b> and the Watson-Jones anterolateral approach (Smith-Petersen 1949; Watson-Jones 1934). Chechik et al. surveyed 292 orthopedic surgeons from 57 countries {{and found that}} the posterior approach was used by 45 % and the <b>direct</b> lateral <b>approach</b> by 42 %.

5|$|The US forces made further {{attempts}} to secure Hill 206 on 13March, but several attacks were defeated after the American troops crested the South Knob. As casualties mounted, McCulloch resolved {{to abandon the}} <b>direct</b> <b>approach,</b> instead deciding that he would seek to wear down the defenders on the South Knob after patrols discovered that the Japanese had no reserves left to reinforce the position. From this it was assessed that their effort in the sector had been spent and {{regardless of whether they}} managed to hold the South Knob, they would be unable to exploit the position further. For their own part, the Japanese had also reached a similar conclusion and had begun transferring troops from this sector north to reinforce the Magata Unit around the northern perimeter in an effort to concentrate enough force in order to achieve a break in. Consequently, they had left only a small force on the South Knob. Over the following days this force was subjected to heavy bombardment and flame attacks, which lasted until the Japanese counterattack petered out on the northern perimeter and the Japanese withdrew from the position on 27March. Casualties in the Hill 206 sector amounted to 98 US servicemen killed, 24 missing, and 581 wounded. A total of 560 Japanese dead were found on top of the South Knob when the US forces reoccupied it on 28March.|$|E
5|$|They {{pitched a}} number of live-action ideas to Kanbar and {{proposed}} that he invest in a development division of their company, paying them and covering their rent {{in exchange for a}} significant portion of the rights to any scripts that they might sell. Kanbar however, was interested in a more <b>direct</b> <b>approach,</b> and preferred to focus on trying to produce a single film. He had always been a great admirer of animation and was impressed after being shown a direct-to-DVD computer-animated short film that Cory had made called Wobots. He suggested the possibility of producing an animated feature with them that would tell a familiar story with a twist, and gave them a month to come up with a story idea. Kanbar had expressed interest in Cinderella or Pinocchio, but the Edwards brothers did not like these ideas as they had already been done by Walt Disney. A few days after the brothers' initial meeting with Kanbar, Todd found inspiration in non-linear crime dramas, such as Rashomon, Pulp Fiction, Run Lola Run, and Memento and came up with the idea of telling the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood as a police investigation, using multiple points of view.|$|E
5|$|Fighting in the Caen area {{versus the}} 21st Panzer, the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend and other units soon reached a stalemate. During Operation Perch, XXX Corps {{attempted}} to advance south towards Mont Pinçon but soon abandoned the <b>direct</b> <b>approach</b> {{in favour of}} a pincer attack to encircle Caen. XXX Corps made a flanking move from Tilly-sur-Seulles towards Villers-Bocage with part of the 7th Armoured Division, while I Corps tried to pass Caen to the east. The attack by I Corps' attack was quickly halted and XXX Corps briefly captured Villers-Bocage. Advanced elements of the British force were ambushed, initiating a day-long Battle of Villers-Bocage and then the Battle of the Box. The British were forced to withdraw to Tilly-sur-Seulles. After a delay because of storms from 17–23 June, Operation Epsom began on 26 June, an attempt by VIII Corps to swing around and attack Caen from the south-west and establish a bridgehead south of the Odon. Although the operation failed to take Caen, the Germans suffered many tank losses after committing every available Panzer unit to the operation. Rundstedt was dismissed on 1 July and replaced as OB West by Field Marshal Günther von Kluge after remarking {{that the war was}} now lost. The northern suburbs of Caen were bombed on the evening of 7 July and then occupied north of the River Orne in Operation Charnwood on 8–9 July. Operation Atlantic and Operation Goodwood captured the rest of Caen and the high ground to the south from 18–21 July by when the city was nearly destroyed. Hitler survived an assassination attempt on 20 July.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to compare methods for {{detecting}} and/or measuring regular equivalence in valued networks. The methods compared can be divided into direct and indirect methods. The indirect methods considered here are all variants of the REGE algorithm (White, 2005). All direct methods have roots in Batagelj, Doreian, and Ferligoj (1992); however they have been adapted for valued networks (Žiberna, 2006 b). All approaches are compared on an empirical valued social network. Variants of the REGE algorithm are also compared on a few artificial valued networks in order to clarify their functionality. This is not necessary for <b>direct</b> <b>approaches,</b> which have clearly defined ideal blocks. In discussion, advantages and disadvantages of both indirect and <b>direct</b> <b>approaches</b> are discussed...|$|R

40|$|AIM: We {{hypothesize that}} a dual {{mobility}} cup {{can be safely}} used via the <b>direct</b> anterior <b>approach,</b> without increasing the risk of complications or incorrect positioning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study compared 201 primary total hip arthroplasties using a dual mobility cup performed via <b>direct</b> anterior <b>approach</b> without a traction table, to 101 arthroplasties performed via posterolateral approach. Implant positioning, function scores, and early complications were recorded. RESULTS: Implant positioning was appropriate in both groups, with a higher cup anteversion in <b>direct</b> anterior <b>approach.</b> The complications rates were similar in both groups, with no dislocation or infection. CONCLUSION: The <b>direct</b> anterior <b>approach</b> without traction table associated with a dual mobility cup does not {{increase the risk of}} complications or non-optimal positioning of implants. This strategy is interesting for patients with high risk of post-operative dislocation...|$|R
40|$|The skin {{has evolved}} {{to resist the}} {{penetration}} of foreign substances and particles. Effective topical drug delivery into and/or through the skin is hindered by these epidermal barriers. A range of physical enhancement methods has been developed to selectively overcome this barrier. This review discusses recent advances in physical drug delivery by broadly separating the techniques into two main areas; indirect and <b>direct</b> <b>approaches.</b> Indirect approaches consist of electrical, vibrational or laser instrumentation that creates pores in the skin followed by application of the drug. <b>Direct</b> <b>approaches</b> consist of mechanical disruption of the epidermis using techniques such as microdermabrasion, biolistic injectors and microneedles. Although, in general, physical techniques are yet to be established in a clinical setting, the potential gains of enhancing delivery of compounds through the skin is of great significance and will no doubt continue to receive much attention...|$|R

25|$|Some {{aspects of}} vacuum {{structure}} in light-front quantization {{can be analyzed}} by studying properties of massive states. In particular, by studying the appearance of degeneracies among the lowest massive states, one can determine the critical coupling strength associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking. One can also use a limiting process, where the analysis begins in equal-time quantization but arrives in light-front coordinates as the limit of some chosen parameter. A much more <b>direct</b> <b>approach</b> is to include modes of zero longitudinal momentum (zero modes) in a calculation of a nontrivial light-front vacuum built from these modes; the Hamiltonian then contains effective interactions that determine the vacuum structure and provide for zero-mode exchange interactions between constituents of massive states.|$|E
