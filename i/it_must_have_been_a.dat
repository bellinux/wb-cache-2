Surely <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> personal dispute or a business quarrel. His explanations were met with condescending smiles. One fellow prisoner, a Homestead worker {{who was about to}} stand trial for throwing dynamite at the Pinkertons, told him the workers did not believe in violence. Berkman had no connection with Homestead, and the strike was none of his business. He had only hurt the workers' cause with his action.|$|E
5|$|In late March, West Nohno {{began the}} first of three Boston–Liverpool round trips. On the Halifax–Liverpool leg of this first trip, she had some {{unspecified}} problem that required her return to Halifax, but <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> minor problem since she sailed again for Liverpool a week later. The cargo ship returned to Boston on 3 June and began her second voyage to Liverpool on 30 June. While in the UK she called at Loch Ewe, Methil, and Oban in July and August before her 6 September return to Boston. Her third journey was an extended one that began by sailing from Boston on 3 October. She arrived at Liverpool three weeks later. During the next seven weeks, she made her way to Milford Haven, from which she began her last westbound transatlantic crossing on 13 December. West Nohno arrived in Boston on 5 January 1944.|$|E
25|$|The {{numerous}} waterways of {{the region}} were the main channels of transportation. However, there are references in ancient literature to some roads. Somadeva's Kathasaritsagara mentions a road from Pundravardhana to Pataliputra. Xuanzang travelled from Kajangala to Pundravardhana, thereafter crossed a wide river and proceeded to Kamarupa. There are indications about a road from Pundravardhana to Mithila, then passing through Pataliputra and Buddha Gaya on to Varanasi and Ayodhya, and finally proceeding to Sindh and Gujarat. <b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> major trade route.|$|E

25|$|The mound (mound 1) {{originally}} had {{a diameter of}} nearly 50 m and a height of 6 m. It {{was surrounded by a}} circular ditch 10 m wide. At the time, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> visually extremely striking monument. The tumulus contained three features. An empty pit was placed at the centre, perhaps to mislead potential looters. To the northwest, a wooden chamber of 2 x 1 m contained an inhumation, and to the southeast, a cremation burial had been placed in some kind of wooden container. Cremations are more commonly associated with the Halstatt phase, inhumation with the La Tène one.|$|E
25|$|Here then De Morgan {{had made}} a great advance by {{introducing}} quantification of the terms. At that time Sir William Hamilton was teaching in Edinburgh a doctrine of the quantification of the predicate, and a correspondence sprang up. However, De Morgan soon perceived that Hamilton's quantification was of a different character; that it meant for example, substituting the two forms The whole of A is the whole of B, and The whole of A {{is a part of}} B for the Aristotelian form All A's are B's. Hamilton thought that he had placed the keystone in the Aristotelian arch, as he phrased it. Although <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> curious arch which could stand 2000 years without a keystone. As a consequence he had no room for De Morgan's innovations. He accused De Morgan of plagiarism, and the controversy raged for years in the columns of the Athenæum, and in the publications of the two writers.|$|E

According to Factory lore, Warhol, whose films were often shut down by the police for obscenity, thought the script was so pornographic that <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> police trap. Solanas contacted Warhol about the script, and was told that he had lost it. He also jokingly offered her a job at the Factory as a typist. Insulted, Solanas demanded money for the lost manuscript. Instead, Warhol paid her $25 to appear in his film, I, a Man.|$|E

Joseph Mawle, who was previously cast to play Benjen Stark and was featured in three episodes in the show's first season before disappearing (as he does in the A Song of Ice and Fire series that the show is based on). In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Bryan Cogman spoke of the re-introduction of Benjen and Mawle to the show saying [...] "It was great to have Joe Mawle back with us – <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> trip for him to step back into the character after so long – but he's also decidedly not the Benjen of season 1. So that was fun to explore." [...] Mawle had been interviewed in 2013, where he expressed his desire to return to the series.|$|E
500|$|Although it {{was common}} {{knowledge}} that the Old Vic triumvirate had been dismissed, they refused to be drawn on the matter in public, and Olivier even arranged to play a final London season with the company in 1949, as RichardIII, Sir Peter Teazle, and Chorus in his own production of Anouilh's Antigone with Leigh in the title role. After that, {{he was free to}} embark on a new career as an actor-manager. In partnership with Binkie Beaumont he staged the English premiere of Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire, with Leigh in the central role of Blanche DuBois. The play was condemned by most critics, but the production was a considerable commercial success, and led to Leigh's casting as Blanche in the 1951 film version. Gielgud, who was a devoted friend of Leigh's, doubted whether Olivier was wise to let her play the demanding role of the mentally unstable heroine: [...] " [...] was so very like her, in a way. <b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> most dreadful strain to do it night after night. She would be shaking and white and quite distraught at the end of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Senji Ishii of Famitsu Xbox 360 {{praised the}} {{scenario}} for its detail {{and noted that}} events that were overlooked as insignificant later returned to affect events of the future. Due {{to the way the}} plot ties the many different events of the game together, Ishii believes <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> lot of work to write the scenarios. In 2009, the Famitsu Awards gave Steins;Gate an annual Game of Excellence award. 4Gamer.net commented that Steins;Gate is comparable to [...] and felt that it is a gem that has not been seen in recent years. ITmedia Gamez noted that players should be attentive to all the details in the story as the twists will surprise the player in many different ways. It was also suggested to the player that the characters' voices be left turned on as the voice acting is very good. The review did caution that players who have played through the demo and who did not enjoy the atmosphere of the game were not likely to find the rest of the game interesting. Steins;Gate has also been praised by Square Enix producer Tomoya Asano, who described it as having [...] "appealing and likable characters and a scenario that surprised players"; this led to Steins;Gate writer Naotaka Hayashi writing the plot and characters for the role-playing video game [...] In 2011, Steins;Gate was voted #6 in Famitsus poll of [...] "most tear-inducing games" [...] of all time.|$|E

500|$|On October 27, Increase Mather {{recorded}} his {{one and only}} diary entry for all of 1683: [...] "Randolph arrived at Boston." [...] Phips quickly began to provide {{a show of force}} for Randolph by insisting other ships strike their colors and firing across their bows if they did not. [...] Knepp claims that Narborough did not condone this, and many historians have followed his lead in treating Phips' activities in Boston harbor as arrogant showboating, but it seems clear from the letters of Randolph and Blathwayt [...] that Phips was not doing this merely for some explosive fun. Phips cites personal instructions from the King and indeed Charles II was known to have insisted on a salute to his flag. As Phips was creating chaos for the Massachusetts government, he continued to pursue his original intention of gathering diving equipment and divers to take to the Bahamas. Phips later followed the same procedures of requiring ships to strike in the West Indies and with a new crew in Bermuda. Phips lack of experience in the Royal Navy would suggest he likely made mistakes and did not always go about this procedure in the best way. <b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> strange and uncomfortable chore for someone whose loyalties were with Boston (in '76 the records show initiated the building of a house in Boston). Randolph was never one to withhold criticism, but he did not complain of Phips activities in Boston harbor that winter and Randolph even seems to have assisted Phips by searching a ship for him. [...] But choosing a threatening posture showed Randolph's inability to understand the New England character and it did not produce the effect Randolph intended. The magistrates voted to submit to the crown, but the deputies resisted. [...] Phips and the Rose became a focal point for the resistance, as Knepp dutifully recorded without understanding the subtext: [...] "Phips crew say that they would as soon fire against this town as against Algiers and called us rebels," [...] is one deposition Knepp records though Knepp seems to believe he is merely recording a barroom brawl. [...] "...one of the constables in particular told him that he thought Capt. Phips had been a town born child, Captain Phips answering him, 'Let him be what he would, he had been sworn at sixteen years of age to be true to the King and his government." [...] (As if in an act of delayed vengeance, HMS Rose would be boarded and de-masted, and its captain John George imprisoned, less than six years later during the Boston Revolution.) ...|$|E
