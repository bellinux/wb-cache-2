25|$|The retail {{environment}} {{not only}} affects quality perceptions, {{but can also}} impact on the way that customers navigate {{their way through the}} retail space during the retail service encounter. Layout, directional signage, the placement of furniture, shelves and <b>display</b> <b>space</b> along with the store's ambient conditions all affect patron's passage through the retail service system. Layout refers to how equipment, shelves and other furnishings are placed and the relationship between them. In a retail setting, accessibility is an important aspect of layout. For example, the grid layout used by supermarkets with long aisles and gondolas at the end displaying premium merchandise or promotional items, minimises the time customers spend in the environment and makes productive use of available space. The gondola, so favoured by supermarkets, {{is an example of a}} retail design feature known as a merchandise outpost and which refers to special displays, typically at or near the end of an aisle, whose purpose is to stimulate impulse purchasing or to complement other products in the vicinity. For example, the meat cabinet at the supermarket might use a merchandise outpost to suggest a range of marinades or spice rubs to complement particular cuts of meat. As a generalisation, merchandise outposts are updated regularly so that they maintain a sense of novelty.|$|E

40|$|As users {{travel from}} place to place, they can {{encounter}} display servers, that is, machines which supply a collaborative content-sharing environment. Users need a way to control how content is arranged on these <b>display</b> <b>spaces.</b> The software for controlling these <b>display</b> <b>spaces</b> should be consistent from display server to display server. However, display servers could be controlled by institutions which may not allow for the control software to be installed. This article introduces the window broker protocol which allows users to carry familiar control techniques on portable personal devices and use the control technique on any display server without installing the control software on the display server. This article also discusses how the window broker protocol mitigates some security risks that arise from potentially malicious display servers...|$|R
500|$|Word of the museum's {{collection}} {{continued to}} spread until, according to [...] "Permanent Interim Acting Director" [...] Louise Reilly Sacco, [...] "it got {{completely out of}} hand" [...] {{when a group of}} senior citizens on a tour bus stopped to see it. In 1995 the <b>display</b> <b>space</b> was moved to the basement of the Dedham Community Theatre, a building with an aesthetic described in 2004 as [...] "ramshackle". The museum in Dedham had no fixed operating hours, instead being open while the theater upstairs was open.

500|$|In 1963 the Glass Age Development Committee {{commissioned}} a {{design for a}} replacement bridge at Vauxhall, inspired by {{the design of the}} Crystal Palace, to be called the Crystal Span. The Crystal Span was to have been a seven-story building supported by two piers in the river, overhanging the river banks at either end. The structure itself would have been enclosed in an air conditioned glass shell. The lowest floor would have contained two three-lane carriageways for vehicles, with a layer of shops and a skating rink in the centre of the upper floors. The southern end of the upper floors was to house a luxury hotel, whilst the northern end was to house the modern art collection of the nearby Tate Gallery, which at this time was suffering from a severe shortage of <b>display</b> <b>space.</b> The roof was to have housed a series of roof gardens, observation platforms and courtyards, surrounding a large open-air theatre. The entire structure would have been [...] long and [...] wide. Despite much public interest in the proposals, the London County Council was reluctant to pay the estimated £7million (£ in [...] ) construction costs, and the scheme was abandoned.|$|E
500|$|When Roberts & Vinter {{made the}} {{decision}} to close down New Worlds in 1963, Moorcock and Ballard considered publishing a new magazine that would be willing, as Carnell had been, to publish experimental material. [...] Moorcock assembled a dummy issue, and later described his intentions: [...] "It would be on art paper, to take good quality illustrations; it would be the size of, say, Playboy so that it would get good <b>display</b> <b>space</b> on the newsstands; it would specialise in experimental work by writers like [...] Burroughs and [...] Paolozzi, but it would be 'popular', it would seek to publicise such experimenters; it would publish all those writers who had become demoralised by a lack of sympathetic publishers and by baffled critics; it would attempt a cross-fertilization of popular sf, science and the work of the literary and artistic avant garde." [...] Moorcock also wrote a letter to Carnell setting out his thoughts on what science fiction needed: [...] "Editors who are willing to take a risk on a story and run it even though this may bring criticism on their heads." [...] The letter was published in the final Nova Publications issue, which also carried the announcement that Moorcock would be taking over from Carnell as editor of New Worlds, though Moorcock had been unaware he would be considered for the post when he wrote his letter.|$|E

500|$|The {{chambers}} of the prince-bishops and cardinals of the House of Rohan {{are divided into}} the grand appartement (<b>display</b> <b>space,</b> facing the river, or south) and petit appartement (living space, facing the inner court and the cathedral, or north), as in the Palace of Versailles. On {{either side of the}} suites are the two most spacious rooms of the palace, the Synod Hall (a single, vast room composed of the dining hall and the guards' hall, separated by a row of arches) and the library, which both extend over the entire longitudinal axis of the wing. The library also serves as the nave of the palace's very small chapel. The grand appartement is composed of the Salle des évêques (Bishops' Hall)– the former Antichambre du roi– the Chambre du roi (Bedchamber of the King), the Cabinet du roi (Cabinet of the King), also known as the Salon d'assemblée (Assembly Room) and the Garde-robe du roi (Cloakroom of the King). The [...] "petit appartement" [...] is composed of the Antichambre du prince-évêque, the Chambre du prince-évêque, the Cabinet du prince-évêque (turned into Napoleons bedchamber after 1800) and the Garde-robe du prince-évêque. The castle's garderobe (Cabinet de commodités) is situated next to the cloakroom of the prince-bishop. The interiors were designed according to the decorative principles established by Jacques-François Blondel in his influential book De la distribution des maisons de plaisance et de la décoration des édifices en général (1738), and the stucco and boiseries were influenced by the style of Nicolas Pineau.|$|E

2500|$|The Paris Gibson Square Museum of Art (PGSMA) was {{incorporated}} as a nonprofit institution in 1976. [...] It {{was named for}} Paris Gibson, the city's founder. The museum faced two immediate problems. [...] First, the historic building was climate controlled for the storage or display of perishable art, and lacked storage space. Second, the museum had no collection to display. Renovations began immediately, with community volunteers providing most of the work. Some aspects of the building—such as the highly detailed brass doorknobs and door hinges, the carved door frames, and ornate iron grating over the air vents—were retained. However, the [...] high oak wainscoting and historic slate blackboards were covered over with drywall, which both protected them from damage as well as provided much-needed <b>display</b> <b>space.</b> As the Great Falls High School structure was renovated, the museum quickly began acquiring art for display, primarily through donations. In late 1976, it acquired 243 sculptures by Lee Steen, a nationally known folk artist from Roundup, Montana. The museum, unable to display Steen's work, stored it in its attic.|$|E
