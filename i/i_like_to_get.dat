500|$|Boucaud is a midfielder who {{can play}} in attacking and {{defensive}} midfield positions. He {{is described as a}} [...] "stylish player with a deft touch" [...] who has [...] "the ability to create chances as well as provide a shield to the [...] ". He describes himself as [...] "a player who loves football, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it down and pass". After signing for Wycombe in 2007, he was described by manager Paul Lambert as a [...] "gritty competitor who is also very good on the ball".|$|E
500|$|Till plays as winger on {{the left}} or right sides and his play has been {{described}} as [...] "tricky". He has described himself as an old-fashioned winger, saying [...] "I am very quick, very fit. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> at the full-back – an old-fashioned winger type, if you like. I like to cause the full-back problems and get my crosses in and link up with our full-back as well". Walsall manager Chris Hutchings described him as [...] "an attacking wide-man with pace who is not afraid to take people on" [...] in 2009. Till is also able to play as a striker.|$|E
500|$|On joining Walsall as a 19-year-old, Davis {{described}} himself as [...] "the type of player who likes to break things down and do what I call the 'nitty-gritty'. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> stuck in and work hard". He is primarily a defensive midfielder, reportedly priding himself on [...] "ball-winning ground-covering defensive midfield work"; his major contribution to his team comes from [...] "flying around midfield winning the ball and disrupting the opposition". Lee Clark suggested he looks best when using his power and strength and keeping {{his use of the}} ball simple. Dean Saunders mentioned his [...] "winning mentality"; according to the Birmingham Mail Brian Dick, [...] "when Blues are down no-one leads by example quite as much as Davis".|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{are such}} {{lots of things}} <b>I</b> should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> buy," [...] Evan said. [...] "I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> buy mother a new Sunday bonnet, and <b>I</b> should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> you a pound of bacca; and Winnie wants {{a new pair of}} boots and stockings, and there's lots of things <b>I</b> should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> for Harry, and some warm gloves for Sue, and--and no end of things." ...|$|R
5000|$|Wanting to {{give the}} fans a proper ending, Esther, Richard and Aaron {{approach}} ABC about a reunion movie. The network is reluctant, but Aarons influence prevails. The cast happily return at reduced salaries; when asked if she wants a stunt double for Alexis final catfight with Krystle, Joan quips, [...] "What the hell — for a few shots <b>Id</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in this time!" [...] All depart smiling, knowing they have made history.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{very glad}} to hear it," [...] quoth Daffydowndilly; [...] "but if you please, sir, <b>I</b> should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{out of his way}} as soon as possible." ...|$|R
2500|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} with People, Selleck talked about {{living and working}} on his farm: [...] "So <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> outside {{and work on the}} farm, from fixing roads to clearing brush. I hate going to the gym, so sweating outdoors sure beats sitting on a stationary bike staring at my navel. And I work cheaper than anyone I could hire to do it." [...] Selleck has also stated he dislikes avocados.|$|E
2500|$|Environmental Golf Course Design is an {{integral}} part of Hurdzan's golf course design style, which has been appreciated by golf lovers through his design of the Widow's Walk Golf Course in Scituate, Massachusetts (opened in 1996) and the Harbor Links Golf Course in North Hempstead, New York. In Howard Richman's article Man with the plans in the Golf Course Management (GCM) Magazine of December 2012, Hurdzan explained his golf course design approach in these words: [...] "Form follows function — you'll hear that a lot around here," [...] Hurdzan says. [...] "The form is something that is a direct result of the function it has to serve. That is why I work so closely with superintendents. I ask them 'How are you going to mow that?' … 'How are you going to rake that?' … 'Are you going to be able to irrigate that?' I try to get a superintendent to think ahead. I don't want to leave them with problems. I want to leave them with solutions. That's why <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them involved." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Allen's opinion, she couldn't learn {{fast enough}} to make a first-rate movie, {{although}} she thought Marnie did have some good scenes in it. She took a lot of the responsibility for what is considered a very flawed movie, since Hitchcock loved her script so much so that he did not make as good a movie as he should have. Hitchcock would have made her a director but she told him no. Said Allen: [...] "It seems perfectly clear to me that any project takes a minimum of a year to direct. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> things on and over with. ... Did you ever hear the phrase, 'the lady proposes, the studio disposes'? I didn’t make it up. I would never propose myself as a director." [...] Under Hitchcock's mentoring, Allen developed the screenwriting talent she would use the rest of her career. Allen wrote that she never felt discriminated against. While being one of the rare female screenwriters in Hollywood in the 1960s, she said [...] "almost all of the men I worked with were supportive. If I was getting a bum rap somewhere, I didn’t know it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's a lemon, if {{ever there}} was one," [...] was what Andy said after his {{punishment}} had come to an end. [...] "Oh, wouldn't <b>I</b> just <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> square with him!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's it," [...] Blake {{agreed with}} a humorous twinkle. [...] "It's true that what I have doesn't amount to much, but I'm {{throwing}} in what <b>I</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get,</b> and that's a great deal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but sometimes, if only I {{could manage}} it, I think that <b>I</b> should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away from here, and take another line, {{something}} bigger. I do not suppose that I ever shall, but <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> {{think of it}} sometimes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] he went on, [...] "I don't {{care for}} it. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the hair clear {{back to the}} superficies and make out a new brow line." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. HIGGINS. No use, dear. I'm sorry; but I can't get round your vowels; {{and though}} <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> pretty postcards in your patent shorthand, I {{always have to}} read the copies in {{ordinary}} writing you so thoughtfully send me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{they liked}} you well enough, I daresay. I like you, but <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of you sometimes." [...] There {{could be no}} doubt as to this last. Even at the time, I often doubted whether that six o'clock bedtime was not {{occasionally}} half-past five.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think <b>I</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> ashore {{as soon as}} possible, Della," [...] {{returned}} the aunt. [...] "I just hate the water, anyway, and I don't think I'll take another sea trip in a hurry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] Selingman continued. [...] "Just as you in London {{have great}} {{newspapers}} {{which seem to}} devote themselves to stirring up bitter feeling between our two countries, so we, alas! in Germany, have newspapers and journals which seem to devote all their energies to the same object. Now in this Irish question the action of your Government has been very much misrepresented in that section of our Press and much condemned. <b>I</b> should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> at the truth from an authoritative source. <b>I</b> should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{it in such a}} form that I can present it fairly and honestly to the public of Germany." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir; not money, I think," [...] replied I. [...] "In fact, sir, I believe I {{have the}} thing in my breast-pocket; and, {{to tell you the}} truth, <b>I</b> should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it put in safety." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on {{good terms}} with all the boys," [...] {{explained}} Norris, as they walked leisurely along. [...] "I'm on the best of terms with every one in the establishment but Massanet, and I'd like to be with him, only he's so awfully slow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “No, thank you,” Latimer spoke up. “I don’t {{object to}} losing my money, but <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{a run for}} it anyway. There never was a time when there wasn’t trouble when you and that brother of yours got together, and I’ll lay twenty to one on that.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Putney and {{the doctor}} began {{to talk of the}} nature and origin of evil, and Annie and the boy listened. Putney took high ground, and {{attributed}} it to Adam. [...] "You know, Annie," [...] he explained, [...] "I don't believe this; but <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a scientific man that won't quite deny Scripture or the good old Bible premises, and see him suffer. Hello! you up yet, Winthrop? I guess I'll go through the form of carrying you to bed, my son." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I haven't {{seen the}} film," [...] said Clavell in 1986. [...] "It just hasn't been {{convenient}} {{for me to}} see it... <b>I</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the rights <b>to</b> my book back {{and turn it into a}} mini-series." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am saying," [...] said he, hunching his shoulders, and {{shivering}} as he spoke, yet, his glance {{unable to meet}} hers, [...] "that it is your fault that <b>I</b> am <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> my throat cut before sunset." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir; not money, I think," [...] replied I. [...] "In fact, sir, I believe I {{have the}} thing in my breast pocket; and {{to tell you the}} truth, <b>I</b> should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it put in safety." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Lady Beach-Mandarin intervened with {{demands for}} support {{for her own}} {{particular}} Bazaar project and they were eating salad {{before there was a}} chance of another word between them. [...] "I must confess that when I want to talk to people <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them alone," [...] said Mr. Brumley, and gave form to thoughts that were already on the verge of crystallization in her own mind. She had been recalling that she had liked his voice before, noting something very kindly and thoughtful and brotherly about his right profile and thinking how much an hour's talk with him would help to clear up her ideas.|$|E
60|$|Second: {{also from}} 5 to 7 P.M. {{the stretch of}} Fifth avenue, {{all the way from}} the Central Park exits at Fifty-ninth street, down to Fourteenth, {{especially}} along the high grade by Fortieth street, and down the hill. A Mississippi of horses and rich vehicles, not by dozens and scores, but hundreds and thousands--the broad avenue filled and cramm'd with them--a moving, sparkling, hurrying crush, for more than two miles. (I wonder they don't get block'd, but I believe they never do.) Altogether it is to me the marvel sight of New York. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in one of the Fifth avenue stages and ride up, stemming the swift-moving procession. I doubt if London or Paris or any city in the world can show such a carriage carnival as I have seen here five or six times these beautiful May afternoons.|$|E
60|$|Probably every tadpole author {{writes a}} pose novel--at least I hope {{so for the}} sake of my self-respect. Most, after my fashion, burn the thing, or benevolent {{publishers}} lose it. It is an ill thing if by some accident the tadpole tale survives the tadpole stage. The authoress does the feminine equivalent, but I should judge either that she did it more abundantly or else that she burned less. Has she never swept past you with a scornful look, disdained you in all the pride of her beauty, rippled laughter at you, or amazed you with her artless girlishness? And even after the early stages some of the trick may survive, unless I read books with malice instead of charity. I must confess, though, that I have a weakness for finding mine author among his puppets. I conceive him always taking the best parts, like an actor-manager or a little boy playing with his sisters. I do not read many novels with sincere belief, and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> such entertainment from them as I can. So that these artless little self-revelations are very sweet and precious to me among all the lay figures, tragedy and comedy. Since the deception is transparent I {{make the most of the}} transparency, and love to see the clumsy fingers on the strings of the marionettes. And this will be none the less pleasant now that I have so narrowly escaped giving this entertainment to others.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why is he so infernally genial?" [...] {{reflected}} Philip. [...] "Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes;" [...] then aloud, [...] "All right, father; {{but if it}} is all {{the same}} <b>to</b> you, <b>I</b> should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> some dinner first." ...|$|R
6000|$|No {{one took}} up the {{question}} again, and it was Kenby who spoke next. [...] "The doctor thinks, if this weather holds, that we shall be into Plymouth Wednesday morning. <b>I</b> always <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a professional opinion on the ship's run." ...|$|R
60|$|Why {{not sell}} {{simultaneous}} rights, for this once, to the Ladies' Home Journal or Collier's, or both, and recoup yourself?--for <b>I</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it <b>to</b> classes that can't afford Harper's. Although it doesn't preach, there's a sermon concealed in it.|$|R
6000|$|With breathless secrecy Father {{planned to}} entice Mrs. Vance Carter to [...] "The T Room." [...] Once they had her there, she would {{certainly}} appreciate the wholesome goodness of Mother's cooking. He imagined long intimate conversations in which Mrs. Carter {{would say to}} him, [...] "Mr. Appleby, I can't {{tell you how much}} <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away from my French cook and enjoy your nice old house and Mrs. Appleby's delicious homey doughnuts." [...] It was easy to win Mrs. Carter, in imagination. Sitting by himself in the rose-arbor while Mother served their infrequent customers or stood at the door unhappily watching for them, Father visualized Mrs. Carter exclaiming over the view from the arbor, the sunset across the moors as seen from their door--which was, Father believed, absolutely the largest and finest sunset in the world. He {{even went so far as}} to discover in Mrs. Vance Carter, Mrs. Cabot-Winslow-Carter, a sneaking fondness for cribbage, which, in her exalted social position, she had had to conceal. He saw her send the chauffeur away, and cache her lorgnette, and roll up her sleeves, and simply wade into an orgy of cribbage, with pleasing light refreshments of cider and cakes waiting by the fireplace. Then he saw Mrs. Carter sending all her acquaintances to [...] "The T Room," [...] and the establishment so prosperous that Miss Mitchin would come around and beg the Applebys to enter into partnership.|$|E
6000|$|I am {{very glad}} of it, being a disbeliever in punishments of all sorts. I am always {{glad to have}} sinners get off, for <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> off from my own sins; and I have a bad moment from my sense of them {{whenever}} another's have found him out. But as yet I have not convinced myself that {{the sort of thing}} we have been considering is a sin at all, for it seems to deprave no more than it dishonors; or that it is what the dictionary (with very unnecessary brutality) calls a [...] "crime" [...] and a [...] "theft." [...] If it is either, it is differently conditioned, if not differently natured, from all other crimes and thefts. These may be more or less artfully and hopefully concealed, but plagiarism carries inevitable detection with it. If you take a man's hat or coat out of his hall, you may pawn it before the police overtake you; if you take his horse out of his stable, you may ride it away beyond pursuit and sell it; if you take his purse out of his pocket, you may pass it to a pal in the crowd, and easily prove your innocence. But if you take his sermon, or his essay, or even his apposite reflection, you cannot escape discovery. The world is full of idle people reading books, and they are only too glad to act as detectives; they please their miserable vanity by showing their alertness, and are proud to hear witness against you in the court of parallel columns. You have no safety in the obscurity of the author from whom you take your own; there is always that most terrible reader, the reader of one book, who knows that very author, and will the more indecently hasten to bring you to the bar because he knows no other, and wishes to display his erudition. A man may escape for centuries and yet be found out. In the notorious case of William Shakespeare the offender seemed finally secure of his prey; and yet one poor lady, who ended in a lunatic asylum, was able to detect him at last, and to restore the goods to their rightful owner, Sir Francis Bacon.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{was good}} enough. I turned, {{cut across the}} fields, went {{straight}} back to the station and took the next ferry-boat to Gravesend, and came back that way. It is quite {{clear to me that}} not only is this girl on the track still, but the chase is getting to be a very hot one, and that not only are they watching you, but they are watching me, and have in some way or other, though how, I cannot guess, found out that I go down to Tilbury, and have accordingly sent a man down to follow me. Now, I tell you frankly, I will have no {{more to do with the}} matter--that is to say, as far as going down on your business. As I have told you, I have always managed my own affairs so well that the police and I have no acquaintance whatever; and I am not going to be spied upon and followed and have the 'tecs upon my track about an affair in which I have no interest at all, except that, you having stood by my brother, I was glad to do you any service I could. But this is getting serious. I don't like it. I have told you I have business with the man, and get things off abroad through him that I should have great trouble in getting rid of in any other way; but unless in quite exceptional cases, these things are so small that they could be hidden away for months without much risk of their being found, however sharp the hunt after them might be. As I am in no way pressed for money I can afford to wait, though I own that <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the things off my hands as soon as I can, and as I considered that I ran practically no risk in going down with them into Essex, I never kept them at my house. However, for a time I must do so. I must tell you that when I am going down I always write beforehand and make an appointment for him to have his barge at the wharf at Pitsea, and I send my letter addressed to him: 'Mr. William Nibson, barge Mary Ann, care of Mr. Scholey, Spotted Horse, Pitsea.' You had better write to him in future. You need not put anything inside the envelope except notes for twenty-five pounds, and the words, 'For the child's keep for six months.' I need not say that you had better disguise your writing, both on the envelope and on the inside, and it is best that you should get your notes from some bookmaker on a race-course. You tell me you often go to races now and do a little betting. They are not the sort of men who take the numbers of the notes they pay out, and it would be next to impossible for them to be traced to you." ...|$|E
