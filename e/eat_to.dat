In the mid-1960s and early 1970s, killer whales came to much greater public and scientific awareness, {{starting with the}} first live-capture and display of a killer whale known as Moby Doll, a resident harpooned off Saturna Island in 1964. So little was known at the time, it was nearly {{two months before the}} whale's keepers discovered what food (fish) it was willing to <b>eat.</b> <b>To</b> the surprise of those who saw him, Moby Doll was a docile, nonaggressive whale that made no attempts to attack humans.|$|E

25|$|Kangaroo rats live in arid and {{semi-arid}} areas {{particularly on}} sandy or soft soils which {{are suitable for}} burrowing. They can, however, vary in both geographic range and habitat. In particular, Merriam's kangaroo rats live in areas of low rainfall and humidity, and high summer temperature and evaporation rates. They {{can be found in}} areas of varying elevation, ranging from below sea level to about 4500 feet. They live in areas of stony soils, including clays, gravel and rocks, which are harder than soils preferred by some other species like banner-tail kangaroo rats. Merriam's kangaroo rats live in hot and dry areas and so must conserve water. They do this in part by lowering their metabolic rate, which reduces loss of water through their skin and respiratory system. They obtain enough water from the metabolic oxidation of the seeds they <b>eat</b> <b>to</b> survive and do not need to drink water at all.|$|E

One Night Stand was a recording of a jazz program billed as [...] "an evening of all-stars" [...] at Carnegie Hall, with appearances by Kenny Barron, Arthur Blythe, George Duke, Herbie Hancock, Roland Hanna, Bobby Hutcherson and ten other musicians. Blondie's video cassette <b>Eat</b> <b>to</b> the Beat accompanied their 1979 album of the same title. The First National Kidisc, {{one of the first}} interactive and educational videodiscs, contained activities designed for children. Without [...] "fancy digital effects", Green's Kidisc provided five to ten hours of interactive capability within a 30-minute video through the use of dual audio tracks, freeze framing, slow motion, and other techniques. Features included plane flying, jokes, paper plane construction, music performance, and other games.|$|E

500|$|The first {{historical}} document related to Texas was {{a map of}} the Gulf Coast, created in 1519 by Spanish explorer Alonso Álvarez de Pineda. Nine years later, shipwrecked Spanish explorer Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and his cohort became the first Europeans in what is now Texas. Cabeza de Vaca reported that in 1528, when the Spanish landed in the area, [...] "half the natives died from a disease of the bowels and blamed us." [...] Cabeza de Vaca also made observations about the way of life of the Ignaces Natives of Texas: [...] "They went about with a firebrand, setting fire to the plains and timber so as to drive off the mosquitos, and also to get lizards and similar things which they <b>eat,</b> <b>to</b> come out of the soil. In the same manner they kill deer, encircling them with fires, and they do it also to deprive the animals of pasture, compelling them to go for food where the Indians want." ...|$|E

It seems the King told her to come to bed — she replied what right has a dog or a bitch there, which instantly gave vent to his ill temper that he had been brooding some days, and used a word of four letters belonging only to Waterclosets. She retorted, [...] "Oh, I suppose that is what you <b>eat</b> <b>to</b> exist on." [...] This brought the King's rage to an instant climax and [...] threw the articles at her head. I had intended to call yesterday to see how he continues to improve, but this domestic fracas of the Royal household puts it out of the question, till a few days more when the King will be settled and not so upset.|$|E

2500|$|The colloquial term [...] "poisonous snake" [...] is {{generally}} an incorrect label for snakes. A poison is inhaled or ingested, whereas venom produced by snakes is injected into its victim via fangs. There are, however, two exceptions: Rhabdophis sequesters toxins from the toads it eats, then secretes them from nuchal glands {{to ward off}} predators, and a small unusual population of garter snakes in the U.S. state of Oregon retains enough toxins in their livers from the newts they <b>eat</b> <b>to</b> be effectively poisonous to small local predators (such as crows and foxes).|$|E
2500|$|In another version, Dionysus was {{originally}} {{the son of}} Zeus by either Demeter or Persephone. Hera sent her Titans to rip the baby apart, from which he was called Zagreus ("Torn in Pieces"). Zeus rescued the heart; or, the heart was saved, variously, by Athena, Rhea, or Demeter. Zeus used the heart to recreate Dionysus and implant him in the womb of Semele—hence Dionysus became known as [...] "the twice-born". Certain versions imply that Zeus gave Semele the heart to <b>eat</b> <b>to</b> impregnate her. Hera tricked Semele into asking Zeus to reveal his true form, which killed her. Dionysus later managed to rescue his mother from the underworld and have her live on Mount Olympus.|$|E

[...] Though Abu Ayub Al Ansari had prepared meals for only Muhammad and Abubakr, Muhammad directed that everyone in the neighborhood be invited to partake in the meal.

40|$|Is desire <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> in {{response}} <b>to</b> positive emotions an 'obese' eating style: a style {{more prevalent in}} people with obesity? In other words: Is Kummerspeck (German: sorrow-fat) for some people a misnomer? This question was addressed in three studies on women. Study 1 (n = 188) tested the moderator effect of subjective well-being on the association of BMI with the scale on desire <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> {{in response}} <b>to</b> negative emotions (DEBQ-E). Study 2 tested in women (n = 832) whether items on desire <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> in response <b>to</b> positive emotions loaded on the same factor as those in response to negative emotions and body mass. Study 3 assessed in the total sample (n = 203) and an overweight subsample (n = 40) a) whether self-reported desire <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> in response <b>to</b> positive emotions predicted actual food intake and b) whether this also held true over and above self-reported desire <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> in response <b>to</b> negative emotions. Study 1 showed only for women with low positive affect a significant positive association of BMI with DEBQ-E. In Study 2, only items on desire <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> in response <b>to</b> negative emotions loaded on the same factor as BMI. Study 3 : In the total sample, the significant effect on food intake of the scale on desire <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> in response <b>to</b> positive emotions disappeared when a scale on desire <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> in response <b>to</b> negative emotions {{was added to the}} model. In the overweight-subsample there was only an effect on food intake for desire <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> in response <b>to</b> negative emotions. It is concluded that only desire <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> in response <b>to</b> negative emotions is an 'obese' eating style, suggesting that Kummerspeck is not a misnomer...|$|R

With Blondie, Fripp appeared live on stage at Hammersmith Odeon on 12 January 1980 participating in the band's cover version of Bowie's [...] ""Heroes"".

Accordingly, several researchers have identified worldview transformation in members of various self-help groups dealing with addiction issues.

2500|$|Stocking is a pink-and-violet-haired goth angel {{with pale}} {{skin and a}} gluttonous {{appetite}} for sugary foods.

Whilst she doesn't have the same level of interest in sex as her sister, she does show sexual urges and interests and is generally more interested in masochistic activities, such as bondage and electrocution. Like Panty, Stocking houses more tender feelings than what she usually lets on.
