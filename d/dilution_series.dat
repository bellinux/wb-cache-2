Test samples included two separate <b>dilutions</b> <b>series</b> of plasma samples from experimentally infected chimpanzees and a panel of 48 serum specimens from patients with community-acquired hepatitis C virus. The quantity of HCV RNA in each chimpanzee plasma sample was determined by using branched DNA (bDNA) signal amplification assay (Quantiplex HCV RNA assay; Chiron Corp., Emeryville, Calif.). Both PCR assays demonstrated similar levels of detection and could reliably detect 13 bDNA genome equivalents per sample. We found an overall concordance of 88 % between results of two PCR assays with the community-acquired panel, which resolved to 100 % when discrepant samples were retested by nested PCR. TaqMan compared favorably with nested PCR with key advantages of speed, increased throughput, and decreased opportunity for false-positive results because of elimination of second-round amplification...|$|R

This investigation followed a previous cross-cultural study on odour perception and representation (2000 - 2001). We conducted two experiments which were designed for this study. In the first experiment, the detection threshold of three different odorants: one odorant each is considered to be more familiar to one and only one of the two countries and the third odorant is judged to be equally familiar in all two countries, was determined by using the 4 -AFC (alternative forced choices) paradigm (Lawless et al, 1993; Lawless et al, 1994) and the randomized odours. A session consisted of a randomized presentation of a 7 <b>dilutions</b> <b>series</b> for all three odorants with 4 repetitions for each concentration. 20 French students and 20 Vietnamese students were presented with 3 odorants in seven different concentrations in coded amber glass bottles.

Hence, a more affordable in-house procedure was set up {{taking into account the}} specific epidemiological and economic circumstances of Cuba. The performance characteristics of the in-house assay were evaluated using clinical samples with various subtypes and resistance patterns. The lower limit of amplification was determined on <b>dilutions</b> <b>series</b> of 20 clinical isolates and ranged from 84 to 529 RNA copies/mL. For the assessment of trueness, 14 clinical samples were analyzed and the ViroSeq HIV- 1 Genotyping System v 2. 0 was used as the reference standard. The mean nucleotide sequence identity between the two assays was 98. 7 % ± 1. 0. Additionally, 99. 0 % of the amino acids at drug resistance positions were identical. The sensitivity and specificity in detecting drug resistance mutations was respectively 94. 1 % and 99. 5 %. Only few discordances in drug resistance interpretation patterns were observed. The repeatability and reproducibility were evaluated using 10 clinical samples with 3 replicates per sample. The in-house test was very precise as nucleotide sequence identity among paired nucleotide sequences ranged from 98. 7 % to 99. 9 %. The acceptance criteria were met by the in-house test for all performance characteristics, demonstrating a high degree of accuracy. Subsequently, the applicability in routine clinical practice was evaluated on 380 plasma samples. The amplification success rate was 91 % and good quality consensus sequences encoding the entire protease and the first 335 codons in reverse transcriptase could be obtained for 99 % of the successful amplicons. The reagent cost per sample using the in-house procedure was around € 80 per genotyping attempt. Overall, the in-house assay provided good results, was feasible with equipment and reagents available in Cuba and was half as expensive as commercial assays. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAromatic {{hydrocarbons}} {{are among}} the main constituents of crude oil and represent a major fraction of biogenic hydrocarbons. Anthropogenic influences as well as biological production lead to exposure and accumulation of these toxic chemicals {{in the water column}} and sediment of marine environments. The ability to degrade these compounds in situ has been demonstrated for oxygen- and sulphate-respiring marine micro-organisms. However, if and to what extent nitrate-reducing bacteria contribute to the degradation of hydrocarbons in the marine environment and if these organisms are similar to their well-studied freshwater counterparts has not been investigated thoroughly. Here we determine the potential of marine prokaryotes from different sediments of the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea to couple nitrate reduction to the oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons. Nitrate-dependent oxidation of toluene as an electron donor in anoxic enrichment cultures was elucidated by analyses of nitrate, nitrite and dinitrogen gas, accompanied by cell proliferation. The metabolically active members of the enriched communities were identified by RT-PCR of their 16 S rRNA genes and subsequently quantified by fluorescence in situ hybridization. In all cases, toluene-grown communities were dominated by members of the Gammaproteobacteria, followed in some enrichments by metabolically active alphaproteobacteria as well as members of the Bacteroidetes. From these enrichments, two novel denitrifying toluene-degrading strains belonging to the Gammaproteobacteria were isolated. Two additional toluene-degrading denitrifying strains were isolated from sediments from the Black Sea and the North Sea. These isolates belonged to the Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria. Serial <b>dilutions</b> <b>series</b> with marine sediments indicated that up to 2. 2 × 10 (4) cells cm(- 3) were able to degrade hydrocarbons with nitrate as the electron acceptor.

5000|$|HI {{is closely}} related to the HA assay, but {{includes}} anti-viral antibodies as “inhibitors” to interfere with the virus-RBC interaction. The goal is to characterize the concentration of antibodies in the antiserum or other samples containing antibodies. [...] The HI assay is generally performed by creating a <b>dilution</b> <b>series</b> of antiserum across the rows of a 96-well microtiter plate. Each row would usually be a different sample. A standardized amount of virus or bacteria is added to each well, and the mixture is allowed to incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes. The last well in each row would be a negative control with no virus added. During the incubation, antibodies bind to the viral particles, and if the concentration and binding affinity of the antibodies are high enough, the viral particles are effectively blocked from causing hemagglutination. [...] Next, a standardized amount of RBCs is added to each well and allowed to incubate at room temperature for an additional 30 minutes. The resulting HI plate images usually progress from non-agglutinated, “button” wells with high antibody concentration to agglutinated, red diffuse wells with low antibody concentration. The HI titer value is the inverse of the last dilution of serum that completely inhibited hemagglutination.|$|E
