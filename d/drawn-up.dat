25|$|Throughout 1990, the RAM Plan was {{developed}} by SDB {{and a group of}} selected Serb officers of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) with the purpose of organizing Serbs outside Serbia, consolidating control of the fledgling SDS parties and the prepositioning of arms and ammunition. The plan was meant to prepare the framework for a third Yugoslavia in which all Serbs with their territories would live together in the same state. The journalist Giuseppe Zaccaria summarised a meeting of Serb army officers in Belgrade in 1991, noting that they had adopted an explicit policy to target women and children as the most vulnerable portion of the Muslim religious and social structure. The RAM plan is thought to have been <b>drawn-up</b> in 1980s. Its existence was leaked by Ante Marković, the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia. The existence and possible implementation of it alarmed the Bosnian government.|$|E
25|$|In 1495, the Alcaidaria-mor (similar to the Spanish alcalde) of {{the castle}} {{was given to the}} Captain-major of Angra, who lived there for a while. Later, it would become the {{residence}} of his trusted lieutenant, who was paid a stipend and obliged to take-up residence. Eventually the castle's Alcaidaria-mor was integrated into Captaincy of Angra, when it began {{to be known as the}} Castle of São Cristóvão (1582). It was during the reigns of King John III (1521–1557) and King Sebastian (1568–1578) that the first defensive plans were <b>drawn-up</b> by military engineer Tommaso Benedetto (in 1567). The Italian architect engineer concentrated on a global defense plan for the main islands of the Azores, concentrating the defenses at the ports and anchorages. Consequently, the old castle/fort served little use, and his successor, Ciprião de Figueiredo e Vasconcelos, doubled his efforts with fifty defensive works along the coast of the island. Its strategic role further degenerated, with many of its dependencies used to store gunpowder for Angra, transferred from the Praça Velha for security reasons. Father António Cordeiro (1641-1722), wrote {{of the castle}}'s ruins in his História Insulana, identifying that only the walls remained of the structure, which was also identified by Father Maldonando. The small medieval fort, therefore, was slowly substituted by the coastal defenses of the Fort of São Sebastião and Fort of Santo António, with the latter strategically located at the edge of Monte Brasil (and which created a crossfire zone with the first, to secure the bay).|$|E
500|$|In 1922 {{modifications}} {{were made}} to No.822 during assembly. This was because production delays at Ashford prevented {{the building of a}} proposed 3-cylinder design <b>drawn-up</b> in 1919. Maunsell and Holcroft revised No.822's cylinder arrangement to accommodate a third inside cylinder fitted between the frames. The outside cylinders were also reduced to [...] diameter to accommodate the inside cylinder and its associated valve linkages. The differences between No.822 {{and the rest of the}} Nclass meant that this locomotive was re-designated as the 1919 proposal, becoming the prototype of the SR N1class when completed in March 1923.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was during}} the reigns of John III (1521–1557) and Sebastian (1568–1578) that the first {{defensive}} plans were <b>drawn-up</b> by the Italian architect and a military engineer Tommaso Benedetto (in 1567), who elaborated a plan of global defense for the main islands of the Azores. Further, it was his opinion that, should an enemy attack from the sea, that defenses should be concentrated at the ports and anchorages, defended by the local population, under the responsibility of each municipal authority.|$|E
2500|$|By 1903, {{many of the}} facades {{exposed to}} the Largo do Paço were {{plastered}} and painted, with the walls constructed from wood and mortar. In 1911, the archbishops were expelled definitively from the episcopal palace, and the 8th infantry regiment, courts and municipal firefighters installed in the building. By order of the Comissão Central dos Bens Eclesiásticos (Central Commission for Ecclesiastical Property) on 18 November 1912, following the upheaval caused by the Republican revolution and schism with the church, many of the possessions of the clergy were sold off, including five fountains in the interior gardens (to the Brotherhood of Senhora do Parto for 10$00). On 28 March 1918, the building was ceded to the Ministério de Instrução Pública (Ministry of Public Instruction) and wing occupied by the archbishops was converted into the first Museum D. Diogo de Sousa. By 1920, Dr. Alberto Feio solicited the building to be adapted into a library and archive. The following year, though, the chapel of D. José Bragança was gutted by fire. The project to expand the episcopal palace was <b>drawn-up</b> in 1922 for the new library and archive, even as the west wing was stilled occupied by the regimental garrison.|$|E
2500|$|While {{working in}} the Department of Arms, the Tang dynasty {{cartographer}} Jia Dan (730–805) and his colleagues would acquire information from foreign envoys about their respective homelands, and from these interrogations would produce maps supplemented by textual information. Even within China, ethnographic information on ethnic minorities of non-Han peoples were often described in the local histories and gazetteers of provinces such as Guizhou during the Ming and Qing dynasties. As the Qing dynasty pushed further with its troops and government authorities into areas of Guizhou that were uninhabited and not administered by the Qing government, the official gazetteers of the region would be revised to include the newly <b>drawn-up</b> districts and non-Han ethnic groups (mostly Miao peoples) therein. While the late Ming dynasty officials who compiled {{the information on the}} ethnic groups of Guizhou offered scanty details about them in their gazetteers (perhaps due to their lack of contact with these peoples), the later Qing dynasty gazetteers often provided a much more comprehensive analysis. By 1673 the Guizhou gazetteers featured different written entries for the various Miao peoples of the region. Historian Laura Holsteter writes on the woodblock print illustrations of Miao peoples in the Guizhou gazeteer, stating [...] "the 1692 version of the Kangxi era gazetteer show a refinement in the quality of the illustrations by comparison to 1673".|$|E
60|$|And {{the falling}} night found Mr. Ledbetter--the Mr. Ledbetter who had complained that {{adventure}} was dead--sitting beside his cans of food, his chin resting upon his <b>drawn-up</b> knees, staring through his glasses in dismal mildness over the shining, vacant sea.|$|E
6000|$|The girl, stooping, thrust at {{the handle}} {{projecting}} {{from the trunk}} containing the <b>drawn-up</b> center keel. The iron plate should have dropped at a touch, but did not, and I sprang to her side when she said: [...] "Something must be holding it fast." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{girl was}} sitting on {{the far edge of the}} pool, staring down into the water, resting her head on one <b>drawn-up</b> knee. She had been bathing; he could see that at once.

6000|$|He {{sat down}} on the soft earth, unresisting, {{as if he had been}} chained to the treasure, his <b>drawn-up</b> legs clasped in his hands with an air of hopeless submission, like a slave set on guard. Once only he lifted his head smartly: the rattle of hot musketry fire had reached his ears, like pouring from on high a stream of dry peas upon a drum. After {{listening}} for a while, he said, half aloud-- ...|$|E
60|$|Not so! This {{time the}} grip upon him {{has been one}} of iron, and he has slid and wriggled in vain. Far down the road a little cloud of dust has risen, and draws nearer and grows larger, and the pattering of many hoofs grows louder, and in and out between the {{scattered}} groups of <b>drawn-up</b> men, there pushes on its way a brilliant cavalcade of gay-dressed lords and knights. And front and rear, and either flank, there ride the yeomen of the Barons, and in the midst King John.|$|E
6000|$|... “Rich people mus’ work, too,” {{continued}} the Mexican girl dreamily, as she embraced her <b>drawn-up</b> legs and rested her chin upon her knees. “Was old Señor Cristoval more happy than we, {{with all the}} money he loved? No! Meest Weldon works; Meest Hahn works; even Meest Bul-Run works—sometime. If one does not work, one is not happy, Miguel; an’ if one mus’ work, money makes not any difference. So, when Meeldred find she is still poor, an’ has no money an’ no laces, like she hope for, she will work jus’ the same as ever, an’ be happy.” ...|$|E
60|$|Fanny herself, with musing head--her mockings over--was sitting <b>drawn-up</b> {{on a stool}} by the fire. I {{doubt if}} she was thinking. Whether or not, to my enchanted eyes some phantom within her seemed content merely to be her beauty. And in rest, there was a grace in her body--the smooth shoulder, the poised head that, because, perhaps, it was so transitory, seemed to {{resemble}} the never-changing--that mimicry of the unknown which {{may be seen in}} a flower, in a green hill, even in an animal. It is as though, I do think, what we love most in this life must of necessity share two worlds.|$|E
6000|$|They came slowly forward, {{a central}} figure on a gray horse leading here--as in history. A short, thick-set man with a grizzled beard closely cropped around an inscrutable mouth, and the serious {{formality}} of a respectable country deacon in his aspect, which even the major-generals blazon on the shoulder-strap of his loose tunic on his soldierly seat in the saddle could not entirely obliterate. He had evidently perceived the general of brigade, and quickened his horse as the latter drew up. The staff followed more leisurely, but still with some curiosity, to witness {{the meeting of the}} first general of the army with the youngest. The division general saluted, but almost instantly withdrew his leathern gauntlet, and offered his bared hand to the brigadier. The words of heroes are scant. The <b>drawn-up</b> detail, the waiting staff listened. This was all they heard:-- ...|$|E
60|$|He {{shook his}} head with mournful regret and threw another handful of fuel on the fire. The burst of clear flame lit up his broad, dark, and {{pock-marked}} face, where the big lips, stained with betel-juice, looked like a deep and bleeding gash of a fresh wound. The reflection of the firelight gleamed brightly in his solitary eye, lending {{it for a moment}} a fierce animation that died out together with the short-lived flame. With quick touches of his bare hands he raked the embers into a heap, then, wiping the warm ash on his waistcloth--his only garment--he clasped his thin legs with his entwined fingers, and rested his chin on his <b>drawn-up</b> knees. Lakamba stirred slightly without changing his position or taking his eyes off the glowing coals, on which they had been fixed in dreamy immobility.|$|E
60|$|A sigh {{coming from}} the bottom of her heart, flew out into the world through her parted lips. A sigh faint, profound, and broken; a sigh full of pain and fear, like the sigh of those who are about to face the unknown: to face it in loneliness, in doubt, and without hope. She let go her hair, that fell {{scattered}} over her shoulders like a funeral veil, and she sank down suddenly by the door. Her hands clasped her ankles; she rested her head on her <b>drawn-up</b> knees, and remained still, very still, under the streaming mourning of her hair. She was thinking of him; of the days by the brook; she was thinking of all that had been their love--and she sat in the abandoned posture of those who sit weeping by the dead, of those who watch and mourn over a corpse.|$|E
6000|$|Once off, {{she did not}} care; {{she should}} be sure of at least seeing Sylvia, and telling her uncle her troubles. She had one great start, when the door was opened, and a gentleman peered in; but it was merely {{to see if there}} was room, for she heard him say, [...] "Only a child," [...] and in came a lady and two gentlemen, who at least filled up the window so that nobody could see her, while they talked a great deal to someone on the platform. And then after some bell-ringing, whistling, sailing {{backwards}} and forwards, and stopping, they were fairly off--getting away from the roofs of London--seeing the sky clear of smoke and fog--getting nearer home every moment; and Countess Kate relaxed her shy, frightened, <b>drawn-up</b> attitude, gave a long breath, felt that the deed was done, and began to dwell on the delight with which she should be greeted at home, and think how to surprise them all! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And indeed {{all that}} huge extent of {{mushroom}} ground was, I found, peppered with these prostrate figures sleeping under an opiate until the moon had need of them. There were scores of them of all sorts, {{and we were}} able to turn over some of them, and examine them more precisely than I had been able to previously. They breathed noisily at my doing so, but did not wake. One, I remember very distinctly: he left a strong impression, I think, because some trick the light and of his attitude was strongly suggestive a <b>drawn-up</b> human figure. His fore-limbs were long, delicate tentacles--he was some kind of refined manipulator--and the pose of his slumber suggested a submissive suffering. No doubt it was a mistake for me to interpret his expression in that way, but I did. And as Phi-oo rolled him over into the darkness among the livid fleshiness again I felt a distinctly unpleasant sensation, although as he rolled the insect in him was confessed.|$|E
6000|$|They adjourned to {{the hall}} now, {{to wait for the}} bride's departure. Her face as she came down the stairs was impassive, gay, with a furtive trouble in the eyes, and once more Shelton had the odd {{sensation}} of having sinned against his manhood. Jammed close to him was her old nurse, whose puffy, yellow face was pouting with emotion, while tears rolled from her eyes. She was trying to say something, but in the hubbub her farewell was lost. There was a scamper to the carriage, a flurry of rice and flowers; the shoe was flung against the sharply <b>drawn-up</b> window. Then Benjy's shaven face was seen a moment, bland and steely; the footman folded his arms, and with a solemn crunch the brougham wheels rolled away. [...] "How splendidly it went off!" [...] said a voice on Shelton's right. [...] "She looked a little pale," [...] said a voice on Shelton's left. He put his hand up to his forehead; behind him the old nurse sniffed.|$|E
60|$|One by one {{the clocks}} in hall and kitchen struck out the hours, and, the wind being in the East, borne on it came the chimes of St Peter's. Automatically I counted the strokes, turning this way and that, as if my life {{depended}} on this foolish arithmetic, yet ready, like Job, to curse the day I was born. What had my existence been but a blind futility, my thought for others but a mask of egotism and selfishness? Yet, in all this turmoil of mind, I must have slept, for suddenly I found myself stiff, <b>drawn-up,</b> and wideawake--listening to a cautious, reiterated tapping against my window-pane. A tallow night-light burned beside me in a saucer of water. For {{the first time in}} my life--at least since childhood--I had been afraid to face the dark. Why, I know not; but I at once leapt out of bed and blew out that light. The night was moonless, but high and starry. I peered through the curtains, and a shrouded figure became visible in the garden--Fanny's.|$|E
60|$|It had {{not been}} an exhilarating evening. Small {{children}} were not much to Lucilla's taste, and her nephew was not a flattering specimen. He had the whitened <b>drawn-up</b> appearance {{of a child who}} had {{spent most of his life}} in a London cellar, with a pinched little visage and preternatural-looking black eyes, a squeaky little fretful voice, and all the language he had yet acquired decidedly cockney. Moreover, he had the habits of a spoilt child, and that a vulgar one, and his grandmother expected his aunt to think him a prodigy. There was a vacant room where Lucilla passed as much of her time as she could without an assumption of superiority, but she was obliged to spend the evening in the small furniture-encumbered parlour, and hear by turns of her nephew's traits of genius, of the merits of the preachers in Cat-alley, and the histories of the lodgers. The motherly Mrs. Murrell had invited any of the young men whose 'hearts might be touched' to attend her 'simple family worship;' and to Lucilla's discomfiture and her triumph, a youth appeared in the evening, and the young lady had her doubts whether the expounding were the attraction.|$|E
6000|$|... "These {{are most}} small circumstances; but {{happening}} just now to me, become indices to all immensities. For now am I hate-shod! On these I will skate to my acquittal!

6000|$|... "What's {{the matter}} now?" [...] said a seldom-heard voice.--"Fall back, men! Fall back, there!" [...] {{repeated}} Mr. Creighton, sternly, pushing through.--"Here's the old man," [...] whispered some.--"The cook's in there, sir," [...] exclaimed several, backing away. The door clattered open; a broad stream of light darted out on wondering faces; a warm whiff of vitiated air passed. The two mates towered {{head and shoulders}} above the spare, grey-haired man who stood revealed between them, in shabby clothes, stiff and angular, like a small carved figure, and with a thin, composed face. The cook got up from his knees. Jimmy sat high in the bunk, clasping his <b>drawn-up</b> legs. The tassel of the blue night-cap almost imperceptibly trembled over his knees. They gazed astonished at his long, curved back, while the white corner of one eye gleamed blindly at them. He was afraid to turn his head, he shrank within himself; and there was an aspect astounding and animal-like in the perfection of his expectant immobility. A thing of instinct--the unthinking stillness of a scared brute. [...] "What are you doing here?" [...] asked Mr. Baker, sharply.--"My duty," [...] said the cook, with ardour.--"Your... what?" [...] began the mate. Captain Allistoun touched his arm lightly.--"I know his caper," [...] he said, in a low voice. [...] "Come out of that, Podmore," [...] he ordered, aloud.|$|E
6000|$|She {{turned into}} the lane; dimly, a hundred or more yards away, {{she could see the}} willows, the width of lighter grey that was the river. The river--"Away, my rolling river!"--the river--and the happiest hours of all her life! If he were anywhere, she would find him there, where he had sung, and lain with his head on her breast, and swum and splashed about her; where she had dreamed, and seen beauty, and loved him so! She reached the bank. Cold and grey and silent, swifter than yesterday, the stream was flowing by, its dim far shore {{brightening}} slowly in the first break of dawn. And Gyp stood motionless, drawing her breath in gasps after her long run; her knees trembled; gave way. She sat down on the wet grass, clasping her arms round her <b>drawn-up</b> legs, rocking herself to and fro, and her loosened hair fell over her face. The blood beat in her ears; her heart felt suffocated; all her body seemed on fire, yet numb. She sat, moving her head up and down--as the head of one moves that is gasping her last--waiting for breath--breath and strength to let go life, to slip down into the grey water. And that queer apartness from self, which is the property of fever, came on her, so that she seemed to see herself sitting there, waiting, and thought: 'I shall see myself dead, floating among the reeds. I shall see the birds wondering above me!' And, suddenly, she broke into a storm of dry sobbing, and all things vanished from her, save just the rocking of her body, the gasping of her breath, and the sound of it in her ears. Her boy--her boy--and his poor hair! [...] "Away, my rolling river!" [...] Swaying over, she lay face down, clasping at the wet grass and the earth.|$|E
6000|$|He let go the {{revolver}} altogether, stood hesitating, then throwing his hands out, strode forward--and everything passed from his sight. He {{could not see}} the man, the woman, the earth, the sky--saw nothing, as if in that one stride he had left the visible world behind to step into a black and deserted space. He heard screams round him in that obscurity, screams like the melancholy and pitiful cries of sea-birds that dwell on the lonely reefs of great oceans. Then suddenly a face appeared within a few inches of his own. His face. He felt something in his left hand. His throat [...] . Ah! the thing like a snake's head that darts up and down [...] . He squeezed hard. He was back in the world. He could see the quick beating of eyelids over a pair of eyes that were all whites, the grin of a <b>drawn-up</b> lip, a row of teeth gleaming through the drooping hair of a moustache [...] . Strong white teeth. Knock them down his lying throat [...] . He drew back his right hand, the fist up to the shoulder, knuckles out. From under his feet rose the screams of sea-birds. Thousands of them. Something held his legs [...] . What the devil [...] . He delivered his blow straight from the shoulder, felt the jar right up his arm, and realized suddenly that he was striking something passive and unresisting. His heart sank within him with disappointment, with rage, with mortification. He pushed with his left arm, opening the hand with haste, {{as if he had just}} perceived that he got hold by accident of something repulsive--and he watched with stupefied eyes Willems tottering backwards in groping strides, the white sleeve of his jacket across his face. He watched his distance from that man increase, while he remained motionless, without being able to account to himself for the fact that so much empty space had come in between them. It should have been the other way. They ought to have been very close, and [...] . Ah! He wouldn't fight, he wouldn't resist, he wouldn't defend himself! A cur! Evidently a cur! [...] .

60|$|A draught of air, fanned from {{forward by}} {{the speed of the}} ship, passed {{steadily}} through the long gloom between the high bulwarks, swept over the rows of prone bodies; a few dim flames in globe-lamps were hung short here and there under the ridge-poles, and in the blurred circles of light thrown down and trembling slightly to the unceasing vibration of the ship appeared a chin upturned, two closed eyelids, a dark hand with silver rings, a meagre limb draped in a torn covering, a head bent back, a naked foot, a throat bared and stretched as if offering itself to the knife. The well-to-do had made for their families shelters with heavy boxes and dusty mats; the poor reposed side by side with all they had on earth tied up in a rag under their heads; the lone old men slept, with <b>drawn-up</b> legs, upon their prayer-carpets, with their hands over their ears and one elbow {{on each side of the}} face; a father, his shoulders up and his knees under his forehead, dozed dejectedly by a boy who slept on his back with tousled hair and one arm commandingly extended; a woman covered from head to foot, like a corpse, with a piece of white sheeting, had a naked child in the hollow of each arm; the Arab's belongings, piled right aft, made a heavy mound of broken outlines, with a cargo-lamp swung above, and a great confusion of vague forms behind: gleams of paunchy brass pots, the foot-rest of a deck-chair, blades of spears, the straight scabbard of an old sword leaning against a heap of pillows, the spout of a tin coffee-pot. The patent log on the taffrail periodically rang a single tinkling stroke for every mile traversed on an errand of faith. Above the mass of sleepers a faint and patient sigh at times floated, the exhalation of a troubled dream; and short metallic clangs bursting out suddenly in the depths of the ship, the harsh scrape of a shovel, the violent slam of a furnace-door, exploded brutally, as if the men handling the mysterious things below had their breasts full of fierce anger: while the slim high hull of the steamer went on evenly ahead, without a sway of her bare masts, cleaving continuously the great calm of the waters under the inaccessible serenity of the sky.|$|E
60|$|With {{the return}} of consciousness, I at first had a vague {{impression}} that I was lying somewhere, injured, and incapable of motion; that it was night, and necessary for me to keep my eyes fast shut {{to prevent them from}} being blinded by almost continuous vivid flashes of lightning. Injured, and sore all over, but warm and dry--surely dry; nor was it lightning that dazzled, but firelight. I began to notice things little by little. The fire was burning on a clay floor a few feet from where I was lying. Before it, on a log of wood, sat or crouched a human figure. An old man, with chin on breast and hands clasped before his <b>drawn-up</b> knees; {{only a small portion of}} his forehead and nose visible to me. An Indian I took him to be, from his coarse, lank, grey hair and dark brown skin. I was in a large hut, falling at the sides to within two feet of the floor; but there were no hammocks in it, nor bows and spears, and no skins, not even under me, for I was lying on straw mats. I could hear the storm still raging outside; the rush and splash of rain, and, at intervals, the distant growl of thunder. There was wind, too; I listened to it sobbing in the trees, and occasionally a puff found its way in, and blew up the white ashes at the old man's feet, and shook the yellow flames like a flag. I remembered now how the storm began, the wild girl, the snake-bite, my violent efforts to find a way out of the woods, and, finally, that leap from the bank where recollection ended. That I had not been killed by the venomous tooth, nor the subsequent fearful fall, seemed like a miracle to me. And in that wild, solitary place, lying insensible, in that awful storm and darkness, I had been found by a fellow creature--a savage, doubtless, but a good Samaritan all the same--who had rescued me from death! I was bruised all over and did not attempt to move, fearing the pain it would give me; and I had a racking headache; but these seemed trifling discomforts after such adventures and such perils. I felt that I had recovered or was recovering from that venomous bite; that I would live and not die--live to return to my country; and the thought filled my heart to overflowing, and tears of gratitude and happiness rose to my eyes.|$|E
