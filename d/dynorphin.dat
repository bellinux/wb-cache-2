25|$|<b>Dynorphin</b> acts through κ-opioid receptors, and {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in the CNS, including in the spinal cord and hypothalamus, including in particular the arcuate nucleus and in both oxytocin and vasopressin neurons in the supraoptic nucleus.|$|E
25|$|Oxytocin {{is known}} to be metabolized by the oxytocinase, leucyl/cystinyl aminopeptidase. Other oxytocinases are also known to exist. Amastatin, bestatin (ubenimex), leupeptin, and {{puromycin}} have been found to inhibit the enzymatic degradation of oxytocin, though they also inhibit the degradation of various other peptides, such as vasopressin, met-enkephalin, and <b>dynorphin</b> A.|$|E
25|$|Oxytocin and {{vasopressin}} are {{the only}} known hormones released by the human posterior pituitary gland to act at a distance. However, oxytocin neurons make other peptides, including corticotropin-releasing hormone and <b>dynorphin,</b> for example, that act locally. The magnocellular neurosecretory cells that make oxytocin are adjacent to magnocellular neurosecretory cells that make vasopressin. These are large neuroendocrine neurons which are excitable and can generate action potentials.|$|E
40|$|Neuropeptides induce signal {{transduction}} across the plasma membrane by acting through cell-surface receptors. The <b>dynorphins,</b> endogenous ligands for opioid receptors, are an exception; they also produce non-receptor-mediated effects causing pain and neurodegeneration. To understand non-receptor mechanism(s), we examined interactions of <b>dynorphins</b> with plasma membrane. Using {{fluorescence correlation spectroscopy}} and patch-clamp electrophysiology, we demonstrate that <b>dynorphins</b> accumulate in the membrane and induce a continuum of transient increases in ionic conductance. This phenomenon is consistent with stochastic formation of giant (similar to 2. 7 nm estimated diameter) unstructured non-ion-selective membrane pores. The potency of <b>dynorphins</b> to porate the plasma membrane correlates with their pathogenic effects in cellular and animal models. Membrane poration by <b>dynorphins</b> may represent a mechanism of pathological {{signal transduction}}. Persistent neuronal excitation by this mechanism may lead to profound neuropathological alterations, including neurodegeneration and cell death...|$|R

40|$|The {{hallmark}} of Parkinson’s disease {{is the death}} of nigral dopaminergic neurons, and inflammation in the brain has been increasingly associated with the pathogenesis of this neurolog-ical disorder. <b>Dynorphins</b> are among the major opioid peptides in the striato-nigral pathway and are important in regulating dopaminergic neuronal activities. However, {{it is not clear}} whether <b>dynorphins</b> play a role in the survival of nigral dopa-minergic neurons. We have recently demonstrated that lipo-polysaccharide (LPS) activates the brain immune cells micro-glia, in vitro and in vivo, to release neurotoxic factors to degenerate dopaminergic neurons. The purpose of this study was to explore the neuroprotective effect of <b>dynorphins</b> in the inflammation-mediated degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in rat midbrain neuron-glia cultures. LPS-induced neurotoxicit...|$|R
25|$|Activation of {{both the}} GHB {{receptor}} and GABA(B) {{is responsible for the}} addictive profile of GHB. GHB's effect on dopamine release is biphasic. Low concentrations stimulate dopamine release via the GHB receptor. Higher concentrations inhibit dopamine release via GABA(B) receptors as do other GABA(B) agonists such as baclofen and phenibut. After an initial phase of inhibition, dopamine release is then increased via the GHB receptor. Both the inhibition and increase of dopamine release by GHB are inhibited by opioid antagonists such as naloxone and naltrexone. <b>Dynorphin</b> {{may play a role in}} the inhibition of dopamine release via kappa opioid receptors.|$|E
25|$|Akil {{continued}} {{research in}} the area of opioid peptides and their receptors at the University of Michigan Mental Health Research Institute where she was employed as a basic scientist. Her group combined their research efforts with those of her husband, who was also employed at the University of Michigan as a biological psychiatrist. After characterizing the anatomy of four opioid peptides, beta-endorphin, <b>dynorphin,</b> methionine enkephalin, and leucine enkephalin, and their receptors, the two groups cloned two types of receptors and performed structure-function analyses in order to determine the molecular basis of high affinity and selectivity towards endogenous ligands. Over the years the two laboratories have conducted extensive research in a variety of molecular and neural mechanisms associated with stress reactivity and their relation to anxiety and depression, focusing on the link of opioids and their receptors in stress induced analgesia as well as the role of steroid stress hormone receptors in emotionality. Furthermore, Akil and Watson were the first to demonstrate that there is an abnormal, decreased sensitivity to glucocorticoid fast feedback that occurs at the level of the brain, rather than the pituitary in depressed patients.|$|E
2500|$|The {{basal ganglia}} {{contains}} many afferent glutamatergic inputs, with predominantly GABAergic efferent fibers, modulatory cholinergic pathways, significant dopamine in the pathways {{originating in the}} ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra, as well as various neuropeptides. [...] Neuropeptides found in the basal ganglia include substance P, neurokinin A, cholecystokinin, neurotensin, neurokinin B, neuropeptide Y, somatostatin, <b>dynorphin,</b> enkephaline. [...] Other neuromodulators found in the basal ganglia include nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, and phenylethylamine.|$|E
5000|$|The human {{gene for}} <b>dynorphins</b> (originally called the [...] "Enkephalin B" [...] gene because of {{sequence}} similarity to the enkephalin gene) was isolated and its sequence described in 1983.|$|R
25|$|Endogenous opioid peptides, {{produced}} {{naturally in}} the body, such as endorphins, enkephalins, <b>dynorphins,</b> and endomorphins. Morphine, {{and some other}} opioids, which are produced in small amounts in the body, are included in this category.|$|R
25|$|Opioid receptors are a {{group of}} G protein-coupled receptors with opioids as ligands. The {{endogenous}} opioids are <b>dynorphins,</b> enkephalins, endorphins, endomorphins, and nociceptin. The opioid receptors are ~40% identical to somatostatin receptors (SSTRs). Opiate receptors were discovered in 1972 by the American neuroscientist and pharmacologist named Candace Pert.|$|R
2500|$|Stimulation of the periaqueductal gray {{matter of}} the {{midbrain}} activates enkephalin-releasing neurons that project to the raphe nuclei in the brainstem. 5-HT (serotonin) released from the raphe nuclei descends to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord where it forms excitatory connections with the [...] "inhibitory interneurons" [...] located in Laminae II (aka the substantia gelatinosa). When activated, these interneurons release either enkephalin or <b>dynorphin</b> (endogenous opioid neurotransmitters), which bind to mu opioid receptors on the axons of incoming C and A-delta fibers carrying pain signals from nociceptors activated in the periphery. The activation of the mu-opioid receptor inhibits the release of substance P from these incoming first-order neurons and, in turn, inhibits the activation of the second-order neuron {{that is responsible for}} transmitting the pain signal up the spinothalamic tract to the ventroposteriolateral nucleus (VPL) of the thalamus. The nociceptive signal was inhibited before it was able to reach the cortical areas that interpret the signal as [...] "pain" [...] (such as the anterior cingulate). This is sometimes referred to as the Gate control theory of pain and is supported by the fact that electrical stimulation of the PAG results in immediate and profound analgesia. The periaqueductal gray is also activated by viewing distressing images associated with pain.|$|E
2500|$|The {{striatum}} {{is composed}} mostly of medium spiny neurons. [...] These GABAergic projection neurons project {{to the external}} (lateral) globus pallidus and internal (medial) globus pallidus {{as well as the}} substantia nigra pars reticulata. [...] The projections into the globus pallidus and substantia nigra are primarily dopaminergic, although enkephalin, <b>dynorphin</b> and substance P are expressed. [...] The striatum also contains interneurons that are classified into nitrergic neurons (due to use of nitric oxide as a neurotransmitter), tonically active [...] cholinergic interneurons, parvalbumin-expressing neurons and calretinin-expressing neurons. [...] The dorsal striatum receives significant glutamatergic inputs from the cortex, as well as dopaminergic inputs from the substantia nigra pars compacta. [...] The dorsal striatum is generally considered to be involved in sensorimotor activities. [...] The ventral striatum receives glutamatergic inputs from the limbic areas as well as dopaminergic inputs from the VTA, via the mesolimbic pathway. The ventral striatum is believed {{to play a role in}} reward and other limbic functions. [...] The dorsal striatum is divided into the caudate and putamen by the internal capsule while the ventral striatum is composed of the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle. The caudate has three primary regions of connectivity, with the head of the caudate demonstrating connectivity to the prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex and amygdala. [...] The body and tail show differentiation between the dorsolateral rim and ventral caudate, projecting to the sensorimotor and limbic regions of the striatum respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Dynorphins exert {{their effects}} {{primarily}} through the κ-opioid receptor (KOR), a G-protein-coupled receptor. Two subtypes of KORs have been identified: K1 and K2. [...] Although KOR {{is the primary}} receptor for all dynorphins, the peptides do have some affinity for the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), δ-opioid receptor (DOR),and the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)-type glutamate receptor. Different dynorphins show different receptor selectivities and potencies at receptors. Big <b>dynorphin</b> and <b>dynorphin</b> A have the same selectivity for human KOR, but <b>dynorphin</b> A is more selective for KOR over MOR and DOR than is big <b>dynorphin.</b> Big <b>dynorphin</b> is more potent at KORs than is <b>dynorphin</b> A. Both big <b>dynorphin</b> and <b>dynorphin</b> A are more potent and more selective than <b>dynorphin</b> B.|$|E
25|$|Endogenous opioids include endorphins, enkephalins, <b>dynorphins,</b> {{and even}} {{morphine}} itself. Morphine appears to mimic endorphins. Endorphins, a contraction {{of the term}} endogenous morphines, are responsible for analgesia (reducing pain), causing sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or excitement.|$|R
50|$|Opioid receptors are a {{group of}} {{inhibitory}} G protein-coupled receptors with opioids as ligands. The endogenous opioids are <b>dynorphins,</b> enkephalins, endorphins, endomorphins and nociceptin. The opioid receptors are ~40% identical to somatostatin receptors (SSTRs). Opioid receptors are distributed widely in the brain, and are {{also found in the}} spinal cord and digestive tract.|$|R
50|$|The receptors for enkephalin are {{the delta}} opioid receptors and mu opioid receptors. Opioid receptors are {{a group of}} G-protein-coupled receptors, with other opioids as ligands as well. The other {{endogenous}} opioids are <b>dynorphins</b> (that bind to kappa receptors), endorphins (mu receptors), endomorphins, and nociceptin/orphanin FQ. The opioid receptors are ~40% identical to somatostatin receptors (SSTRs).|$|R
50|$|Big <b>dynorphin</b> {{is a form}} of <b>dynorphin</b> {{consisting}} of <b>dynorphin</b> A and <b>dynorphin</b> B. It has nociceptive and anxiolytic-like properties, as well as effects on memory in mice. It binds to the kappa-opioid receptor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dynorphin</b> {{has been}} implicated as an {{appetite}} stimulant. A {{number of studies}} in rats have shown that increasing the <b>dynorphin</b> levels stimulates eating. Opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, can reverse the effects of elevated <b>dynorphin.</b> This inhibition is especially strong in obese animals or animals that have access to particularly appealing food. Inui et al. found that administering <b>dynorphin</b> to dogs increased both their food and water intake. <b>Dynorphin</b> {{plays a role in}} the eating behavior of hibernating animals. Nizeilski et al. examined <b>dynorphin</b> levels in the ground squirrel, which undergoes periods of excessive eating and periods of starvation before winter. They found that <b>dynorphin</b> levels increased during the starvation periods. Berman et al. studied the levels of <b>dynorphin</b> during periods of food restriction. The group found that while food did not alter the expression of <b>dynorphin</b> B, it increases <b>dynorphin</b> A levels in several rat brain regions (hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis).|$|E
50|$|A {{study by}} Lai et al. found that <b>dynorphin</b> might {{actually}} stimulate pain. The group {{found that it}} acts on the bradykinin receptor as well as KOR. The N-terminal tyrosine of <b>dynorphin</b> A is necessary to activate opioid receptors such as KOR, but is unnecessary in binding to bradykinin receptors. Lai et al. studied the effects of <b>dynorphin</b> A2-13 that did not contain the N-terminal tyrosine. Based {{on the results of}} <b>dynorphin</b> A2-13, the authors proposed a mechanism in which <b>dynorphin</b> A activates bradykinin receptors and thus stimulates pain response.|$|E
40|$|The {{endogenous}} opioid peptides <b>dynorphins</b> and enkephalins {{may be involved}} in brain-area specific synaptic adaptations relevant for different stages of an addiction cycle. We compared the levels of prodynorphin (PDYN) and proenkephalin (PENK) mRNAs (by qRT-PCR), and <b>dynorphins</b> and enkephalins (by radioimmunoassay) in the caudate nucleus and putamen between alcoholics and control subjects. We also evaluated whether PDYN promoter variant rs 1997794 associated with alcoholism affects PDYN expression. Postmortem specimens obtained from 24 alcoholics and 26 controls were included in final statistical analysis. PDYN mRNA and Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe, a marker of PENK were downregulated in the caudate of alcoholics, while PDYN mRNA and Leu-enkephalin-Arg, a marker of PDYN were decreased in the putamen of alcoholics carrying high risk rs 1997794 C allele. Downregulation of opioid peptides in the dorsal striatum may contribute to development of alcoholism including changes in goal directed behavior and formation of a compulsive habit in alcoholics...|$|R
50|$|Through {{activation}} of the KOR, <b>dynorphins,</b> opioid peptides that are the endogenous ligands of the KOR and that can, in many regards, be figuratively thought of as functional inverses of the morphine-like, euphoric and stress-inhibiting endorphins, induce dysphoria and stress-like responses in both animals and humans, as well as psychotomimetic effects in humans, and {{are thought to be}} essential for the mediation of the dysphoric aspects of stress. In addition, <b>dynorphins</b> are believed to be critically involved in producing the changes in neuroplasticity evoked by chronic stress that lead to the development of depressive and anxiety disorders, increased drug-seeking behavior, and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In support of this, in knockout mice lacking the genes encoding the KOR and/or prodynorphin (the endogenous precursor of the <b>dynorphins),</b> many of the usual effects of exposure to chronic stress are completely absent, such as increased immobility in the forced swimming test (a widely employed assay of depressive-like behavior) and increased conditioned place preference for cocaine (a measure of the rewarding properties and addictive susceptibility to cocaine). Accordingly, KOR antagonists show robust efficacy in animal models of depression, anxiety, anhedonia, drug addiction, and other stress-related behavioral and physiological abnormalities. As such, there has been great interest in developing KOR antagonists for the treatment of these and other psychiatric conditions in humans. Progress has been limited until recently however, due to difficulty in finding selective KOR antagonists with suitable drug profiles (e.g., good pharmacokinetic parameters, short-acting (non-"inactivating") KOR inhibition, lack of toxicity, etc.) for clinical development and use in humans.|$|R
50|$|The μ-opioid receptors (MOR) are a {{class of}} opioid receptors with a high {{affinity}} for enkephalins and beta-endorphin, but a low affinity for <b>dynorphins.</b> They are {{also referred to as}} μ-opioid peptide (MOP) receptors. The prototypical μ-opioid receptor agonist is morphine, the primary psychoactive alkaloid in opium. It is an inhibitory G-protein coupled receptor that activates the Gi alpha subunit, inhibiting adenylate cyclase activity, lowering cAMP levels.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dynorphin</b> A {{is a form}} of <b>dynorphin</b> and an {{endogenous}} opioid peptide with the amino acid sequence: Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu-Arg-Arg-Ile-Arg-Pro-Lys-Leu-Lys.|$|E

5000|$|Han and Xie found <b>dynorphin</b> to be 6-10 {{times more}} potent than {{morphine}} {{on a per}} mole basis. In addition, morphine tolerance did not reduce dynorphin-induced analgesia. [...] Ren et al. demonstrated some of the complexities related to <b>dynorphin</b> induced analgesia. The authors found that combining subanalgesic levels of morphine and <b>dynorphin</b> A1-13, a version of <b>dynorphin</b> A containing only the first 13 amino acids of the peptide, in the rat spinal cord had additive effects. However, when <b>dynorphin</b> A1-13 was injected into the intracerebroventriulcar (ICV) region of the brain, it had an antagonist effect on morphine-induced analgesia.|$|E

50|$|These drugs mimic {{three classes}} of endorphins, such as endomorphins, enkephalins, and <b>dynorphins.</b> All {{three of these}} classes each have their own {{receptor}}-mu, kappa, and delta. Opioids will bind to the receptor for the endorphin they are most chemically similar to. Tolerance to some effects occurs with regular use, {{a result of the}} downregulation of the stimulated opioid receptors. Cross tolerance to analgesia may develop incompletely and less rapidly, allowing rotation between opioid medications be used to compensate somewhat for tolerance. This phenomenon is called incomplete cross-tolerance.|$|R

50|$|Dynorphins (Dyn) are a {{class of}} opioid {{peptides}} that arise from the precursor protein prodynorphin. When prodynorphin is cleaved during processing by proprotein convertase 2 (PC2), multiple active peptides are released: <b>dynorphin</b> A, <b>dynorphin</b> B, and α/β-neo-endorphin. Depolarization of a neuron containing prodynorphin stimulates PC2 processing, which occurs within synaptic vesicles in the presynaptic terminal. Occasionally, prodynorphin is not fully processed, leading {{to the release of}} “big dynorphin.” This 32-amino acid molecule consists of both <b>dynorphin</b> A and <b>dynorphin</b> B.|$|E
50|$|Land et al. first {{described}} a mechanism of dysphoria in which corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) provokes <b>dynorphin</b> release. While control mice displayed aversive behaviors {{in response to}} forced swim tests and foot shocks, mice lacking <b>dynorphin</b> did not show any such signs of aversion. They noted that injecting CRF led to aversive behaviors in mice with functional genes for <b>dynorphin</b> {{even in the absence}} of stress, but not in those with <b>dynorphin</b> gene deletions. Place aversion was eliminated when the receptor CRF2 was blocked with an antagonist.|$|E
5000|$|Leumorphin, {{also called}} <b>dynorphin</b> B-29, is a {{naturally}} occurring, endogenous opioid peptide. Derived as a proteolytic cleavage product of residues 226-254 of prodynorphin (preproenkephalin B), leumorphin is a nonacosapeptide (29 amino acids in length) {{and has the}} sequence Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu-Arg-Arg-Gln-Phe-Lys-Val-Val-Thr-Arg-Ser-Gln-Glu-Asp-Pro-Asn-Ala-Tyr-Ser-Gly-Glu-Leu-Phe-Asp-Ala. It can be further reduced to <b>dynorphin</b> B (<b>dynorphin</b> B-13) and <b>dynorphin</b> B-14 by pitrilysin metallopeptidase 1 (formerly referred to as [...] "dynorphin-converting enzyme"), an enzyme of the endopeptidase family. Leumorphin behaves as a potent and selective κ-opioid receptor agonist, similarly to other endogenous opioid peptide derivatives of prodynorphin.|$|E
50|$|Endogenous opioids are {{types of}} opioids {{produced}} by the body specifically to modulate pain. They include endorphins, enkephalins, <b>dynorphins</b> and endomorphins. These peptides are especially important for modulating pain {{in response to the}} environment. These can be released in response to a number of things, including increased blood pressure, pain and danger. It has been found that endogenous opioids are at least partially responsible for phenomena like “Runner's high”, hypoalgesia in the fight-or-flight response, and even for the analgesic effects of acupuncture therapy. In all these cases, there is a certain level of signal processing that occurs in the CNS which leads to the release of these chemicals.|$|R
