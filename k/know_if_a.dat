Smith rejects agnosticism as a third alternative to theism and atheism and promotes terms such as agnostic atheism (the view {{of those who do}} not believe in the existence of any deity, but do not claim to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> deity does or does not exist) and agnostic theism (the view of those who do not claim to know of the existence of any deity, but still believe in such an existence).|$|E

25|$|The {{first known}} {{suggestion}} for viewing randomness {{in terms of}} complexity was made by Leibniz in an obscure 17th-century document discovered after his death. Leibniz asked how one could <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> set of points {{on a piece of}} paper were selected at random (e.g. by splattering ink) or not. Given that for any set of finite points there is always a mathematical equation that can describe the points, (e.g. by Lagrangian interpolation) the question focuses on the way the points are expressed mathematically. Leibniz viewed the points as random if the function describing them had to be extremely complex. Three centuries later, the same concept was formalized as algorithmic randomness by A. N. Kolmogorov and Gregory Chaitin as the minimal length of a computer program needed to describe a finite string as random.|$|E
25|$|Piaget {{argued that}} {{children}} and adults used speech for different purposes. In order to confirm his argument, he experimented analyzing a child’s interpretation of a story. In the experiment, the child listened to a story and then told a friend that same story in his/her/their own words. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine how children verbalize and understand each other without adult intervention. Piaget wanted to examine the limits of naturalistic observation, in order to understand a child’s reasoning. He realized the difficulty of studying children's thoughts, as it is hard to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> child is pretending to believe their thoughts or not. Piaget was the pioneer researcher to examine children’s conversations in a social context – starting from examining their speech and actions – where children were comfortable and spontaneous (Kose, 1987).|$|E

In addition, the party needs to react to the changing situation dynamically; to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> certain policy is obsolete or not, the party had to [...] "seek truth from facts" [...] and follow the slogan [...] "practice is the sole criterion for the truth". At the 14th National Congress, Jiang reiterated Deng's mantra that it was unnecessary to ask if something was socialist or capitalist, since the important factor was whether it worked.|$|E

Maria Theresa, desperate and burdened by pregnancy, wrote plaintively to her sister: [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> town will remain to me for my delivery." [...] She bitterly vowed to spare nothing and no one to defend her kingdom when she wrote to the Bohemian chancellor, Count Philip Kinsky: [...] "My mind is made up. We must put everything at stake to save Bohemia." [...] On 26October, the Elector of Bavaria captured Prague and declared himself King of Bohemia. Maria Theresa, then in Hungary, wept on learning {{of the loss of}} Bohemia. Charles Albert was unanimously elected Holy Roman Emperor on 24January 1742. The Archduchess, who regarded the election as a catastrophe, caught her enemies unprepared by insisting on a winter campaign; the same day he was elected emperor, Austrian troops under Ludwig Andreas von Khevenhüller captured Munich, Charles Albert's capital.|$|E
500|$|In 1973, Górecki {{approached}} the Polish folklorist Adolf Dygacz {{in search of}} traditional melodies to incorporate in a new work. Dygacz presented four songs which had been recorded in the [...] Silesia region in south-western Poland. Górecki {{was impressed by the}} melody [...] "Where has he gone, my dear young son?" [...] (Kajże się podzioł mój synocek miły?), which describes a mother's mourning for a son lost in war, and probably dates from the Silesian Uprisings of 1919–21. Górecki had heard a version of the song in the 1960s and had not been impressed by the arrangement, but the words and the melody of Dygacz's new version made a lasting impression on him. He said [...] "for me, it is a wonderfully poetic text. I do not <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> 'professional' poet would create such a powerful entity out of such terse, simple words. It is not sorrow, despair or resignation, or the wringing of hands: it is just the great grief and lamenting of a mother who has lost her son." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{order for}} {{physicians}} to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> mutation {{is connected to}} a certain disease, researchers often do a study called a “genome-wide association study” (GWAS). A GWAS study will look at one disease, and then sequence the genome of many patients with that particular [...] disease to look for shared mutations in the genome. Mutations that are determined {{to be related to}} a disease by a GWAS study can then be used to diagnose that disease in future patients, by looking at their genome sequence to find that same mutation. The first GWAS, conducted in 2005, studied patients with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD). It found two different mutations, each containing only a variation in only one nucleotide (called single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs), which were associated with ARMD. GWAS studies like this have been very successful in identifying common genetic variations associated with diseases. As of early 2014, over 1,300 GWAS studies have been completed.|$|E
2500|$|Further {{empirical}} {{work has}} highlighted the impact transaction costs {{have on the}} concept of market efficiency, with much evidence suggesting that any anomalies pertaining to market inefficiencies are the result of a cost benefit analysis made by those willing to incur the cost of acquiring the valuable information in order to trade on it. Additionally the concept of liquidity is a critical component to capturing [...] "inefficiencies" [...] in tests for abnormal returns. Any test of this proposition faces the joint hypothesis problem, where it is impossible to ever test for market efficiency, since to do so requires the use of a measuring stick against which abnormal returns are compared —one cannot know if the market is efficient if one does not <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> model correctly stipulates the required rate of return. Consequently, a situation arises where either the asset pricing model is incorrect or the market is inefficient, but one has no way of knowing which is the case.|$|E

One long chapter, book I chapter 27, is also found in another manuscript, Rh. 95 at the Zürich Zentralbibliothek; this is another witness to the c-text and appears to be independent of c2, and so is useful as a further cross-check on the c-text.|$|E

2500|$|Goozee was {{released}} again in 1993, aged 70, and relocated to Chatham, Kent {{where he was}} provided with sheltered housing. It was here, on 25 December 1995, that Goozee lured two girls aged 12 and 13 into his home where he gave them alcohol and then indecently assaulted them. The attacks came to light after the girls contacted ChildLine, a telephone counselling service for children provided by the NSPCC. Goozee was tried at Maidstone Crown Court in December 1996 where the jury cleared him of the rape {{of one of the}} girls but found him guilty of indecent assault. Mr. Justice Gower sentenced him to 6 years imprisonment and said that Goozee's [...] "horrifying" [...] record should be considered if it was felt he should be released in the future. Predating the newspaper's July 2000 campaign for Sarah's Law, the News of the World highlighted the case as an example of why the government should allow controlled access to the Sex Offenders Register, so parents with young children could <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> sex-offender was living in their area. One of the girls' mothers said: [...] "He was put into the community by the authorities, and none of the parents around here knew that he was a child killer.

2500|$|In 1964, Schneemann began {{production}} of her film Fuses, eventually finishing it in 1967. [...] Fuses portrayed Schneemann and her then-boyfriend James Tenney having sex as recorded by a 16 mm Bolex camera. [...] Schneemann then altered the film by staining, burning, and directly {{drawing on the}} celluloid itself, mixing the concepts of painting and collage. [...] The segments were edited together at varying speeds and superimposed with photographs of nature, which she juxtaposed against her and Tenney's bodies and sexual actions. [...] Fuses was motivated by Schneemann's desire to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> woman's depiction of her own sexual acts was different from pornography and classical art {{as well as a}} reaction to Stan Brakhage's Loving (1957), Cat's Cradle (1959) and Window Water Baby Moving (1959). [...] She showed the film to her contemporaries as she worked on it in 1965 and 1966, receiving mostly positive feedback from her peers. [...] Many critics though described it as [...] "narcissistic exhibitionism" [...] and described it as self-indulgent. [...] She received an especially strong reaction regarding the cunnilingus scene of the film. [...] While Fuses is viewed as a [...] "proto-feminist" [...] film, Schneemann feels that it was largely neglected by feminist film historians. [...] The film lacked the fetishism and objectification of the female body as seen in much male-oriented pornography. [...] Two years after its completion, it won a Cannes Film Festival Special Jury Selection prize. [...] Pop artist Andy Warhol, with whom Schneemann was acquainted, having spent time at The Factory, drolly remarked that Schneemann should have taken the film to Hollywood. Fuses became the first in Carolee Schneemann's Autobiographical Trilogy. [...] Though her works of the 1960s such as this shared many of the same ideas with the concurrent Fluxus artists, she remained independent of any specific movement. [...] They did, however, form the groundwork for the feminist art movement of the late 1960s and 1970s. [...] Schneemann points out that the sexuality of the film overrides its formal and structural aspects to many viewers.|$|E

To <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> policy was obsolete or not, the party had to [...] "seek truth from facts" [...] and follow the slogan [...] "practice is the sole criterion of the truth". At the 6th plenum of the 11th Central Committee, the [...] "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China" [...] was adopted. The resolution separated Mao the person from Mao Zedong Thought, claiming that Mao had contravened Mao Zedong Thought during his rule. While the document criticized Mao, it clearly stated that he was a [...] "proletarian revolutionary" [...] (i.e. not all of his views were wrong), and that without Mao {{there would have been no}} new China. Su Shaozi, a party theoretician and the head of the Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought, argued that the CPC needed to reassess the New Economic Policy introduced by Vladimir Lenin and ended by Stalin, as well as Stalin's industrialization policies and the prominent role he gave to class struggle. [...] Su claimed that the [...] "exploiting classes in China had been eliminated". Dong Fureng, a Deputy Director at the Institute of Economics, agreed with the reformist discourse, first by criticizing Marx and Friedrich Engels' view that a socialist society had to abolish private property, and secondly, accusing both Marx and Engels for being vague on what kind of ownership of the means of production was necessary in socialist society. While both Su and Dong agreed that it was the collectivization of agriculture and the establishment of People's Communes which had ended rural exploitation, neither of them sought a return to collectivized agriculture.|$|E
