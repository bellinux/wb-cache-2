40|$|The {{response}} of most neurons <b>in</b> <b>area</b> 21 a to {{stimulation of the}} classical receptive field (CRF) with a grating patch is suppressed by the simultaneous presentation of a grating surrounding the CRF, similar to many neurons <b>in</b> <b>area</b> 17 (1 - 4).

40|$|This {{work had}} as {{objective}} {{to compare the}} communities of Sminthuroidea and Onychiuridae (Collembola) among no-tillage in three fertility levels, conventional tillage and a natural ecosystem (native grassland).

The no-tillage <b>in</b> <b>area</b> of high fertility presented a populational pick in the autumn; the no-tillage <b>in</b> <b>area</b> of low fertility, in the spring; and, the natural ecosystem, in the summer.

5|$|Collected and {{described}} by Robert Brown {{in the early}} 19th century, Banksia speciosa is classified in the series Banksia within the genus. Its closest relative is B. baxteri. Banksia speciosa plants are killed by bushfire, and regenerate from seed. The flowers attract nectar- and insect-feeding birds, particularly honeyeaters, {{and a variety of}} insects. In cultivation, Banksia speciosa grows well in a sunny location on well-drained soil <b>in</b> <b>areas</b> with dry summers. It cannot be grown <b>in</b> <b>areas</b> with humid summers, though it has been grafted onto Banksia serrata or B.integrifolia.|$|E
30|$|In {{contrast}} with Case 2, {{the case with}} the proposed method (Case 3) is faster in settling the oscillations of the tie-line power, and results in smaller frequency deviation <b>in</b> <b>Area</b> 1. Case 2 results in larger than 0.022  Hz maximum frequency deviation <b>in</b> <b>Area</b> 1. However, as for Case 3, the frequency drop <b>in</b> <b>Area</b> 1 is limited to 0.012  Hz, and the maximum frequency deviation of all the three areas does not exceed 0.016  Hz. It indicates that the proposed method (Case 3) has better comprehensive performance than the methods [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] in stabilizing the system frequency <b>in</b> all the <b>areas.</b> When there’s disturbance <b>in</b> <b>Area</b> 1, the DR resources <b>in</b> <b>Area</b> 2 and Area 3 can also provide strong support for frequency control <b>in</b> <b>Area</b> 1 (Fig.  4 h, i), so that the maximum frequency deviation can be reduced.|$|R

30|$|For example, if the {{required}} steering force falls <b>in</b> <b>area</b> 1 (<b>in</b> {{which there is}} no pad), then <b>area</b> 4 (<b>in</b> which there must be a pad) is an unfavorable area.

If the steering force falls <b>in</b> <b>area</b> 2 (<b>in</b> which there is a pad), then area 2 is the favorable <b>area.</b> <b>In</b> this case, a favorable force should be assigned to pad 2 : F 2 [*]=[*]F f, which gives an additional equation. If the steering force is <b>in</b> <b>area</b> 3, then area 6 is the unfavorable area and F 3 [*]=[*]Fuf becomes an additional equation. If the steering force is <b>in</b> <b>area</b> 4, then area 4 is the favorable area and F 1 [*]=[*]Ff gives as an additional equation. If the steering force is <b>in</b> <b>area</b> 5, then area 2 is the unfavorable area and F 3 [*]=[*]Fuf becomes an additional equation.
