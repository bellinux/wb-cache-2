50|$|Acrylic acid {{undergoes}} {{the typical}} reactions of a carboxylic acid. When reacted with an alcohol, it forms the corresponding ester. The esters and salts of acrylic acid are collectively known as acrylates (or propenoates). The most common alkyl <b>esters</b> <b>of</b> <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid</b> are methyl, butyl, ethyl, and 2-ethylhexyl acrylate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Esters</b> <b>of</b> <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid</b> {{contain a}} {{carbon-carbon double bond}} which is {{conjugated}} to an ester group. This allows the possibility of both types of polymerization mechanism. An acrylic ester by itself can undergo chain-growth polymerization to form a homopolymer with a carbon-carbon backbone, such as poly(methyl methacrylate). Also, however, certain acrylic esters can react with diamine monomers by nucleophilic conjugate addition of amine groups to acrylic C=C bonds. In this case the polymerization proceeds by step-growth and the products are poly(beta-amino ester) copolymers, with backbones containing nitrogen (as amine) and oxygen (as ester) as well as carbon.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Hildebrand {{solubility}} {{parameters are}} pre-dicted from molecular simulations using the transferable potentials for phase equilibrium-united atom (TraPPE-UA) and Dreiding force fields for the n-alkyl acrylate and methacrylate esters (n 10), {{as well as}} the 2 -ethyl-hexyl acrylate, 2 -hydroxyethyl acrylate, isooctyl <b>esters</b> <b>of</b> <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid,</b> and the 2 -hydroxyethyl ester of methacrylic acid. The TraPPE-UA force field yields very accurate sol-ubility parameters (with a mean unsigned percent error of 2 % or 0. 2 Hildebrand units), whereas the Dreiding force field overpredicts the solubility parameter in every case examined. Correlations based on the normal boiling point or the refractive index do not yield satisfactory results for this monomer set with the former overestimat-ing the magnitude and the latter yielding the incorrect sign for the decrease in the solubility parameter with chain length. Simulations with the TraPPE-UA force field yield solubility parameters for binary mixtures of methyl methacrylate with 2 -ethylhexyl or isooctyl acrylate, which are very well described by a linear interpolation using the pure compound cohesive energies and molar vol-umes, whereas those for mixtures with 2 -hydroxyethyl acrylate or methacrylate small positive deviations due to structural microheterogeneity.

This thesis is aimed at expanding and improving upon the current knowledge in order to unlock new applications. Four esterification techniques were applied {{to the formation of}} cellulose nanocrystal <b>esters</b> <b>of</b> <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid</b> and methacrylic acid. The degree of surface substitution reached two to three surface hydroxyl groups (the maximum number) available for functionalization and this degree of substitution is very much dependent on the chosen esterification methodology. Two new fluorescently modified cellulose esters based on carbazole- 9 -yl-acetic acid and coumarin- 3 -carboxylic acid were synthesised using p-toluenesulfonyl chloride/pyridine and carbodiimide esterifications methods. Absorption and fluorescent properties were also measured and showed fluorescence proportional to the extent of surface functionalization. The maximum theoretically attainable degree of substitution could be reached while still maintaining the crystal structure of cellulose. Cationic cellulose nanocrystals were produced with a high positive surface charge when compared with the literature. The synthesis procedure was attempted in two steps and in a single step. The degree of modification for pyridinium acetate cellulose and methyl imidazolium acetate cellulose was found to depend significantly on the selected pathway. The cationic nature of the modifications was verified using zeta potential measurements and through adsorption of an anion dye. Synthesised cellulose acrylates and methacrylates were used in Thiol-Ene click reactions in which very mild and environmentally friendly reaction conditions proved to work from 10 min reaction times. Four different thiols were added, with and without hexylamine catalyst.

30|$|Lubricating oils {{play a very}} {{important}} role in automobile industry. It keeps the moving parts lubricated and protects them against rust and corrosion. Lubricating oils alone cannot satisfy all the requirements of modern engines. Some additives are to be blended with lube oil to improve the overall performance of the lubricant [1]. The role of additives in lubricant is very significant. They optimize the performance of lubricant and generally fall into two major categories viz. surface active additive and performance enhancing additive [2]. The first one protects the metal surfaces of the engine from corrosion, such as antiwear, anti-rust and extreme pressure additives [3]. The second type reinforces the base stock performance, such as viscosity index improver (VII) [4, 5], pour point depressant (PPD) [6, 7], antioxidant [8], and detergent–dispersant [9]. Generally, in the formulation of a high performance lubricant, different types of additives at different percentages are blended with the base stocks. This increases the overall cost of the furnished lubricant. The addition of additives having multifunctional character to the base fluid may lead to formulate a cost effective as well as better performing lubricant. Therefore, research in this area has attracted much attention. In this work we have synthesized multifunctional additives which showed excellent VII and PPD performances. Lot of works in this direction has carried out so far. Kamal and his group [10] in their work have shown the application of copolymers of vinyl acetate (VA) and <b>esters</b> <b>of</b> <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid</b> as viscosity index improver for lubricating oil. They also studied the rheological properties of lube oil with and without polymeric additives. Al-Sabagh and his group [11] have mentioned the application of copolymers of VA with n-alkyl itaconate as pour point depressants in lubricating oil. The rheological properties were also studied by the same research team. Abdel-Azim et al. [12] has synthesized the copolymers of dialkyl fumarate with vinyl acetate and recognized that the copolymer of didodecyl fumarate with VA is the most effective as PPD for lubricating oil. In 2008, Nassar [13] had prepared six polymers at different molar ratios of 2 -ethylhexyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate and studied the VI property of the lubricants. He reported that most efficient VI property is obtained when the ratio of acrylate and vinyl acetate is 1 : 0.2. The potential application of copolymer of vinyl acetate (VA) as pour point depressant for crude oil is also well documented. VA—α olefin copolymers [14] and VA—methacrylate copolymers [15] were used as pour point depressant for crude oil. The copolymers of vinyl acetate, styrene and n-butyl acrylate having different monomer ratios were used to study the rheological behaviours of Mexican crude oil [16]. Borthakur and his group [17] have shown the application of alkyl fumarate and vinyl acetate copolymer in combination with alkyl acrylate as a flow improver for high waxy Borholla crude oil. Machado et al. [18] studied the influence of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers on viscosity and pour point of a Brazilian crude oil. Al-Shafy and Ismail prepared an ester of polyethylene acrylic acid with 1 -docosanol and finally it was grafted with vinyl acetate to produce graft ester. The grafted product was used as flow improver for Egyptian waxy crude oils [19].|$|E
