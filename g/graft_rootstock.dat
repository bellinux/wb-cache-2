40|$|A aplicação de nitrogênio via foliar antes da senescência das folhas da videira pode ser uma estratégia para aumentar as reservas deste nutriente nas partes perenes, uma vez que as mesmas são disponibilizadas no início do crescimento vegetativo dos órgãos anuais. O objetivo deste trabalho foi de estimar a absorção e a redistribuição do N adicionado via foliar em videiras jovens. O experimento foi instalado em casa de vegetação na EMBRAPA-Uva e Vinho, no município de Bento Gonçalves (RS). Foram utilizadas as variedades Chardonnay e Riesling Itálico com porta-enxerto 101 - 14 Mgt. Foi cultivada uma planta por vaso contendo 10 kg de solo Neossolo Litólico. A aplicação do N via foliar foi parcelada em três vezes, durante três dias sucessivos. Foram aplicados 84, 84 mg N planta- 1 na forma de (15 NH 4) 2 SO 4. As plantas foram colhidas em sete épocas diferentes. Após a colheita, as plantas foram fracionadas em folhas, enxerto, porta-enxerto, raízes grossas (> 2 mm) e raízes finas (The foliar {{application}} of nitrogen before the leaves senescence {{may be a}} strategy to increase the nutrient reserves in the perennial parts, being available {{in the beginning of}} the vegetative growth of the annual parts.

25|$|Because of {{this most}} of the {{vineyards}} in Argentina are planted on ungrafted rootstock. There are many theories about why phylloxera has not yet reach {{this part of the}} world. The centuries-old tradition of flood irrigation where water is allowed to deeply saturate the soil may be one reason, as is the high proportion of sand present in the soil. The relative isolation of Argentina is also cited as a potential benefit against phylloxera with the country's wine regions being bordered by mountains, deserts and oceans that create natural barriers against the spread of the louse.

Five commercial cucurbit rootstocks (Ace, Shintozwa, ShintoHongto, Zuktozwa and Ferro) were used as rootstocks. Ace, Shintozwa and ShintoHongto were used as rootstocks for Saveh and Samsori, and Zuktozwa and Ferro were applied as rootstocks just for Samsori. Non-grafted plants were used as control. The results showed that the rootstock had a significant effect on total fruit and marketable fruit number, marketable fruit yield and total soluble solids of Samsori accession.
