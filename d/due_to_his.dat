5|$|A complete, {{tenacious}} {{and consistent}} two-footed player, Nedvěd frequently played as a left-sided, offensive wide midfielder or as a left-winger throughout his career, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> crossing ability {{with his left}} foot, as well as <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> ability to cut inside and shoot with his right foot, although {{he was capable of}} playing anywhere in midfield <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> offensive and defensive work-rate. He was also deployed as a central midfielder on occasion, as well as in an attacking midfield and playmaking role, or as a supporting striker, where he excelled as an assist-man <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> excellent dribbling ability, passing range and vision. Primarily known for his powerful shots and volleys from distance, as well as his stamina, he was also noted for his speed, endurance, technique and goal-scoring ability.

5|$|Allen became Jamaica's sixth {{appointed}} governor-general (eighth overall, {{including two}} acting governors-general). He replaced Sir Kenneth O. Hall, who resigned for health reasons.
