And that fused a mobile authentication protocol based on Hash function to realize security access and privacy protection, which can improve security and reduce the complexity of calculation and the implementation cost compared with the typical authentication protocols. The experiment results show that the ratio of relative network delay is below 35 %. The system has strong real-time, high security, more comprehensive data, and lower cost of computation and communication. It can satisfy the requirements of health monitoring <b>for</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes...</b>|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the success of}} a programme of Advance Care Planning education <b>for</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> by examining the effect on staff knowledge, Advance Care Planning practice within the home and end-of-life hospital admission rates. METHOD: Three longitudinal questionnaires assessing staff knowledge, Advance Care Planning Practice and hospital deaths completed before and after the initiation of the Advance Care Planning education programme by homes that had completed the training and those yet to undergo the training. RESULTS: Superior Advance Care Planning knowledge was evident in those staff that had completed the training. There was an increase of 85 % in the number of Advance Care Plans completed in the training homes and an overall reduction in hospital deaths of 25 % for residents from training homes.

Methods: This study is a secondary analysis of a descriptive research study using data from development and validation of the Korean patient safety culture scale <b>for</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes.</b> A total of 982 cases were analyzed using the SPSS Statistics 20 program. Results: For the safety culture of the patient, there was a significant difference based on the size and location of the facility. For the degree of patient safety, age, education, occupation, marital status, and the size of the <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> were significant factors. Patient safety culture and the degree of patient safety had a positive correlation.
