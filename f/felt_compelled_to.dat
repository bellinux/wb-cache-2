Routine rule breaking frustrated camp directors. The most difficult cases were given to the federal court system and the men imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|The {{area that}} is now Providence was first settled in June 1636 by Roger Williams {{and was one of}} the {{original}} Thirteen Colonies of the United States. Williams and his company <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> withdraw from Massachusetts Bay Colony. Providence quickly became a refuge for persecuted religious dissenters, as Williams himself had been exiled from Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|As {{required}} by Mexican federal law for property ownership in Coahuila y Tejas, Houston had been baptized into the Catholic {{faith in the}} Adolphus Sterne House in Nacogdoches prior to Texas independence. By 1854, when Houston told Reverend Samson he <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> make a public profession of faith, perhaps {{on the floor of}} the United States Senate, Margaret and her family had spent 14 years influencing her husband's faith. Ultimately, he decided to make the profession among those who knew him best in Texas.|$|E

5|$|Concerned that {{allegations}} of communists in the SCLC, if made public, would derail the administration's civil rights initiatives, Kennedy warned King to discontinue these associations, and later <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> issue the written directive authorizing the FBI to wiretap King and other SCLC leaders. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover feared the Civil Rights movement and investigated the {{allegations of}} communist infiltration. When no evidence emerged to support this, the FBI used the incidental details caught on tape {{over the next five}} years in attempts to force King out of his leadership position, in the COINTELPRO program.|$|E
5|$|Despite the title, St. John the Baptist Preaching did {{not have}} an {{obviously}} religious theme. The model, an Italian peasant who presented himself at Rodin's studio, possessed an idiosyncratic sense of movement that Rodin <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> capture. Rodin thought of John the Baptist, and carried that association into the title of the work. In 1880, Rodin submitted the sculpture to the Paris Salon. Critics were still mostly dismissive of his work, but the piece finished third in the Salon's sculpture category.|$|E
5|$|Libyan {{involvement}} with Chad {{can be said}} to have started in 1968, during the Chadian Civil War, when the insurgent Muslim National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT) extended its guerrilla war against the Christian President François Tombalbaye to the northerly Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Prefecture (BET). Libya's king Idris I <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> support the FROLINAT because of long-standing strong links between {{the two sides of the}} Chadian-Libyan border. To preserve relations with Chad's former colonial master and current protector, France, Idris limited himself to granting the rebels sanctuary in Libyan territory and to providing only non-lethal supplies.|$|E

5000|$|This {{imagery of}} love and loss {{captured}} Katie's imagination immediately and she says, [...] "As a woman and mother I <b>felt</b> deeply <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> explore these stories.

"I assure you, sir," [...] {{answered}} Peveril, who now <b>felt</b> himself <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> turn about, and reply with civility, [...] "that it {{was with}} difficulty I could prevail on my landlady to add my cover to yours, though she seems now such a zealot for the consumption of eggs and bacon." ...|$|R
5|$|Prime Minister Suzuki <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> {{meet the}} Japanese press, {{to whom he}} reiterated his government's {{commitment}} to ignore the Allies' demands and fight on. The Japanese government did not react. Emperor Hirohito, the government, and the war council considered four conditions for surrender: {{the preservation of the}} kokutai (Imperial institution and national polity), assumption by the Imperial Headquarters of responsibility for disarmament and demobilization, no occupation of the Japanese Home Islands, Korea, or Formosa, and delegation of the punishment of war criminals to the Japanese government.|$|E
5|$|The Jugurthine War of 111–104 BC {{was fought}} between Rome and Jugurtha of the North African kingdom of Numidia. It {{constituted}} the final Roman pacification of Northern Africa, after which Rome largely ceased expansion {{on the continent}} after reaching natural barriers of desert and mountain. Following Jugurtha's usurpation of the throne of Numidia, a loyal ally of Rome since the Punic Wars, Rome <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> intervene. Jugurtha impudently bribed the Romans into accepting his usurpation. Jugurtha was finally captured not in battle but by treachery.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} adapted by the writer Nick Dear, who {{considered}} the story more mature than Austen's other novels. He characterised {{it as one}} of realism and truthfulness, particularly in telling the story of two people separated and then reunited. As Austen's narrative style conveys Anne's thoughts internally, Dear and Root <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> express the character's emotions using comparatively little dialogue. Persuasion was shot in chronological order, allowing the actress to portray Anne's development from being downtrodden to happy and blossoming.|$|E
5000|$|Poirier {{claims that}} [...] "Scrutiny had earned more respect and more {{denunciation}} {{than any other}} quarterly in English". Grant, in responding to Poirier's review of Scrutiny, found that [...] "Scrutiny specialized in being right—half the time. In order <b>to</b> praise, it <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> also <b>to</b> damn, and then found it easy to do so because it possessed [...] "standards" [...] against which all works could be judged." ...|$|R
60|$|Third (and wherein he soars {{far above}} Daniel) the sinewy {{strength}} and originality of single lines and paragraphs: the frequent curiosa felicitas of his diction, of which I need not here give specimens, having anticipated {{them in a}} preceding page. This beauty, and as eminently characteristic of Wordsworth's poetry, his rudest assailants have <b>felt</b> themselves <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> acknowledge and admire.|$|R
50|$|Not {{long after}} the death of Landra (the {{original}} Starshine), Rom left Clairton to continue seeking out Wraiths elsewhere. Brandy <b>felt</b> strangely <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> dig up Starshine's body. A Wraith sorcerer called Doctor Dredd then magically transplanted Brandy's body into the Starshine armor as part of an evil plan. This was something she had secretly yearned for; and afterwards, she left Clairton and accompanied Rom as he traveled the Earth.|$|R
5|$|The oldest {{documented}} {{description of}} hare coursing {{is the work}} known in English as On Coursing. It was written by Arrian a Greek historian of the Roman period, circa 180AD and is known in Anicent Greek as Kynegetikos and in Latin as Cynegeticus. Arrian <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> describe the sight hunt and sighthounds because the Ancient Greeks only knew the scent hunt; On Coursing complements Xenophon's classic work on that subject, Cynegeticus (On Hunting). William Dansey, an English clergyman, translated On Coursing in 1831.|$|E
5|$|When {{the book}} edition of The Vicar of Bullhampton {{appeared}} in April 1870, it bore a preface; Trollope, who ordinarily scorned prefaces and dedications, <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> justify {{the presentation of}} a character like Carry Brattle. He reiterated the points he had made regarding Formosa: that while depicting a fallen woman as glamourous or noble might lead impressionable readers to vice, a true depiction of such a woman's misery might deter readers from yielding to temptation; and might soften the hearts of parents whose daughters have fallen, and thus afford an opportunity of returning to decency.|$|E
5|$|Considering that he {{majored in}} {{political}} science and economics, Kanō's family thought that after graduating from university, he would pursue a career in some government ministry. Indeed, through influential friends of his father's, he was initially offered a position with the Ministry of Finance. However, his love for teaching led him instead to accept a position teaching at Gakushuin. The students of Japan's elite attended Gakushuin and were of higher social positions than their teachers. The students were allowed to ride in rickshaws (jinrikisha) right to {{the doors of the}} classes, whereas teachers were forbidden. The teachers often <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> visit the homes of these students whenever summoned to give instruction or advice. In effect, the teachers were treated as servants.|$|E
50|$|He {{inherited}} a marquistate impoverished {{by the recent}} civil war, and in bad relationships with the neighbouring Duchy of Savoy. Therefore, he <b>felt</b> himself <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> seek help to France, swearing loyalty to Charles, Dauphin of France in April 1375. In the following forty years the margraves repeatedly asked the French help against Savoy: in 1376, for example, Thomas went to Paris, asking to King Charles V that the quarrel with Savoy could be debated at the Paris Parliament.|$|R
2500|$|Hillquit <b>felt</b> himself <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> {{get a job}} to help {{alleviate}} the family's difficult financial situation. Since his English was poor and his body frail, employment options were limited. He joined other young intellectual émigrés from Tsarist Russia a shirt-maker, repetitiously stitching cuffs of garments. In his posthumously-published memoirs, Hillquit recalled that cuff-making was [...] "the simplest part and required least skill and training," [...] involving the simple stitching of square pieces of cut cloth. The young Hillquit never progressed past that entry-level task as a shirtmaker.|$|R
60|$|All {{not only}} felt {{the truth of}} this, but all felt that the speaker, by his consanguinity, had a clear right to interfere, in the manner he had. Still Sir Gervaise Oakes had great {{reluctance}} in yielding to this remonstrance; for, to the distrust he had imbibed of Tom Wychecombe, was added an impression that his host wished to reveal something of interest, in connection with his new favourite, the lieutenant. He <b>felt</b> <b>compelled,</b> notwithstanding, <b>to</b> defer to the acknowledged nephew's better claims, and he refrained from interfering. Fortunately, Sir Wycherly was yet in a state to enforce his own wishes.|$|R
5|$|However, one {{particular}} incident in Kasi {{had a profound}} impact on E.V. Ramasamy's ideology and future work. At the worship site there were free meals offered to guests. To E.V. Ramasamy's shock, he was refused meals at choultries, which exclusively fed Brahmins. Due to extreme hunger, E.V. Ramasamy <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> enter one of the eateries disguised as a Brahmin with a sacred thread on his bare chest, but was betrayed by his moustache. The gatekeeper at the temple concluded that E.V. Ramasamy was not a Brahmin, as Brahmins were not permitted by the Hindu shastras to have moustaches. He not only prevented Periyar's entry but also pushed him rudely into the street.|$|E
5|$|Klein had {{the power}} to make or break {{academic}} careers, so Born <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> atone by submitting an entry for the prize. Because Klein refused to supervise him, Born arranged for Carl Runge to be his supervisor. Woldemar Voigt and Karl Schwarzschild became his other examiners. Starting from his paper, Born developed the equations for the stability conditions. As he became more interested in the topic, he had an apparatus constructed that could test his predictions experimentally. On 13 June 1906, the rector announced that Born had won the prize. A month later, he passed his oral examination and was awarded his PhD in mathematics magna cum laude.|$|E
5|$|Smith said he {{understood}} this would irk the British, but {{insisted that he}} and his government were no longer willing to wait. He had repeatedly offered to respect the judgement of an impartial arbitration team, he reminded Johnston, but the British had shot this idea down each time. He therefore <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> follow the advice given by his own legal team, which was that the appointment was legitimate. His government would not accept a lesser appointment in Lisbon than in Pretoria and Lourenço Marques. He dismissed Johnston's threat to expel the Rhodesian representatives in West Germany, Japan and America; relations with Portugal and South Africa were far more important, he said, as they were Rhodesia's two closest neighbours geographically.|$|E
50|$|During {{his seventh}} {{year at the}} gymnasium, Preobrazhensky <b>felt</b> himself <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> choose which revolutionary {{organisation}} to support, being torn between the competing strategies of the peasant-oriented Socialist-Revolutionary Party (PSR) and the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). Influenced by the Communist Manifesto and another work by Frederick Engels, Preobrazhensky cast his lot with the latter organisation, believing its approach to be scientifically based. Together with two friends, Preobrazhensky declared his formal allegiance to the RSDLP late in 1903 and was accepted into the illegal organisation {{two or three months}} later.|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that a recent article by Z. -D. Zhang is in error and violates {{well-known}} theorems. After receiving an electronic reprint of Zhang’s recent paper [1] some time ago, I have had an email exchange with the author pointing {{out a number of}} errors in the paper, which unfortunately invalidate all its main results. As now also follow-up papers [2, 3] have appeared using Zhang’s erroneous results, I <b>felt</b> finally <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> write down some of my criticism.

When {{she thought of}} that one strongest reason, fully as she agreed with it, {{she was unable to}} tell the father of the girl that she did so. She sat looking at him, wanting words with which she might express her full {{concurrence}} with Marion without plunging a dagger into the other's heart. [...] "Then thou didst agree with her?" [...] There was something terrible in the intensity and slowness of the words as he repeated the question.|$|R
5|$|Bowling {{for long}} periods caused McCool to {{continually}} tear a callus on his third finger, which he used to impart spin on the ball. As a result, Bradman <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> leave {{him out of the}} Test matches, feeling that his finger {{would not be able to}} handle the necessarily long bowling spells. This decision was aided by England and Australia’s agreement to allow a new ball to be used every 55 overs, instead of the incumbent regulation of permitting a new ball for every 200 runs scored, which usually took longer than 55 overs. This meant the ball was in a shiny state more often, and therefore more conducive to fast and swing bowling, so Bradman relied heavily on his pacemen. For the rest of his career, McCool was troubled by the skin rubbing off his spinning finger.|$|E
5|$|Dow {{continued}} to promote prohibition after leaving office, but also added {{his voice to}} the growing chorus advocating the abolition of slavery. Several slaveholding states seceded after the election of Republican presidential candidate Abraham Lincoln, and formed the Confederate States of America; even before {{the outbreak of the}} Civil War, Dow called for the rebellion to be crushed and slavery abolished. He was 57 years old at the outbreak of the war, and determined to stay home and tend to his business and care for his aging father. After the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter, however, Dow <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> join the Union cause. Governor Israel Washburn appointed him Colonel of the 13th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment on November 23, 1861. Many of the officers Dow recruited to the cause were his associates from the prohibition movement.|$|E
5|$|In November 1793, Shelby {{received}} a letter from another of Genêt's agents, Charles Delpeau. He confided to Shelby that he had been sent to secure supplies for an expedition against Spanish holdings, and inquired whether Shelby had been instructed to arrest individuals associated with such a scheme. Three days later Shelby responded by letter, relating Jefferson's warning against aiding the French. Despite having no evidence that Shelby was party to Genêt's scheme, both Jefferson and Knox <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> warn him a second time. Jefferson provided names and descriptions of the French agents believed to be in Kentucky and encouraged their arrest. Knox went a step further by suggesting Kentucky would be reimbursed for any costs incurred resisting the French by force, should such action become necessary. General Anthony Wayne informed him that his cavalry was at the state's disposal. Arthur St. Clair, governor of the American Northwest Territory, also admonished Shelby against cooperation with Genêt.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{downfall}} of SD-6 and his resentment at Sydney for not apparently trusting him, Dixon was pressured by his wife Diane who was now angered by the many years of lies from her husband. He initially <b>felt</b> <b>compelled</b> not <b>to</b> take a position within the CIA. However, following Sydney's capture, Vaughn persuades him to help save Sydney as Dixon {{was the only person}} to have successfully infiltrated the location where she was captured, and eventually he decides to join the CIA. However, he initially finds that he does not wish to make her worry about him coming home at night, and decides to request at transfer to intelligence, which would mean a desk job in analysis.|$|R
60|$|The Dominie was habitually obedient {{to any one}} {{who chose}} to impose {{commands}} upon him: he sunk back into his chair, spread his chequered handkerchief over his face, to serve, as I suppose, for the Grecian painter's veil, and, from the action of his folded hands, appeared for a time engaged {{in the act of}} mental thanksgiving. He then raised his eyes over the screen, as if to be assured that the pleasing apparition had not melted into air; then again sunk them to resume his internal act of devotion, until he <b>felt</b> himself <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> give attention to the Counsellor, from the interest which his questions excited.|$|R
60|$|Isabel {{looked at}} him with a puzzled look, and <b>felt</b> almost <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> laugh, the {{situation}} was so supremely ridiculous. It took a moment to think it all out rationally. Yet, after all, though the letter came from the other brother, Ernest, it was this particular brother, Harold, she had been talking to and admiring all the day; it was this particular brother, Harold, who had gained her consent, and whom she had promised to love and to marry. And at that moment it would have been doing Isabel Walters an injustice not to admit that in her own soul she did then and there really love Harold Carnegie.|$|R
