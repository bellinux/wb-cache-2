[...] And the singing, the organ, the Queen, just everything and everybody. [...] It's really been out of this world. [...] Just to hear Zadok the Priest, I think, has lifted me to Cloud Nine, because it's something that I love. [...] And to hear that and to have the Queen pass so close to me. [...] And yes, she smiled. [...] She smiled at me.|$|E
500|$|TJ of Neon Limelight gave a mixed review, {{calling it}} [...] "sassy" [...] but [...] "would work better {{for an artist}} {{at least a decade}} younger than Aguilera", with its [...] "painfully {{adolescent}} lyrics". Becky Bain of Idolator wrote, [...] "It's one of those pandering songs that will no doubt have young girls singing along, particularly the chorus, but it's a lazy one that leaves rubs us the wrong way." [...] Bradley Stern from MuuMuse named it a [...] "filler, including the noisy, childish chant." [...] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune commented that [...] "it's the kind of trite glitter-disco might've dispensed", while comparing it to Spice Girls' songs. Eric Henderson gave to the song a negative review, writing, [...] "Considering 'I Hate Boys' is closer than <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> Christina would ever come to recording a Daphne Aguilera track, it's ironically also one of many tracks on Bionic that sound tailor-made to accompany the opening credits of Johnny Weir's forthcoming reality show." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 1926, Churchill's {{political}} colleague Sir Samuel Hoare {{described a}} visit {{in a letter}} to the press baron Lord Beaverbrook; [...] "I have never seen Winston before in the role of landed proprietor,... the engineering works on which he is engaged consist of making a series of ponds in a valley and Winston appeared to be a great deal more interested in them than in anything else in the world". In January 1928, James Lees-Milne stayed as a guest of Churchill's son Randolph. He described an evening after dinner; [...] "We remained at that round table till after midnight. Mr Churchill spent a blissful two hours demonstrating with decanters and wine glasses how the Battle of Jutland was fought. He got worked up like a schoolboy, making barking noises in imitation of gunfire, and blowing cigar smoke across the battle scene in imitation of gun smoke". On 26 September 1927 Churchill composed the first of his Chartwell Bulletins, which were lengthy letters to Clementine, written to her while she was abroad. In the bulletins, Churchill described in great detail the ongoing works on the house and the gardens, and aspects of his life there. The 26 September letter opens with a report of Churchill's deepening interest in painting; [...] "Sickert arrived on Friday night and we worked very hard at various paintings... I am really thrilled... I see my way to paint far better pictures than <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> possible before".|$|E

500|$|Supervising {{animator}} Glen Keane designed Rapunzel {{under the}} tutelage of veteran animator Ollie Johnston, one of Disney's Nine Old Men. Johnston advised Keane to attempt to capture what Rapunzel is thinking as opposed to simply animating what the character is doing after reviewing one of his early pencil tests. Keane compared receiving this advice to receiving a [...] "slap that I never forgot, so when I was drawing over people's work, I really tried to get into the head of the thinking of the character". Co-director Byron Howard was inspired by the appearance of Ariel from Disney's The Little Mermaid (1989), a character who was also animated by Keane. Howard elaborated that [...] "Ariel was the first character that <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> there was a soul behind her eyes ... We hoped to do that with Rapunzel to find some sort of soul and depth that people could relate to". Meanwhile, Keane observed that Ariel and Rapunzel also share [...] "irrepressible" [...] spirits while encountering barriers that prevent them from pursuing their dreams. Keane was inspired by a book about the idea of feminine beauty; the book cited [...] "strangeness" [...] as [...] "the key to beauty ... in a woman's face." [...] Taking this into consideration, Keane maintained a sense of asymmetry while drawing Rapunzel, incorporating into her face several subtle imperfections, specifically her bucked teeth. The character was also drawn with freckles, making her the first Disney princess to have this feature. Keane designed Rapunzel with large eyes in order to convey her [...] "irrepressible quality", a trait her also discovered in Mandy Moore's voice. The animators created nine different versions of Rapunzel before finally settling on a design with which they were satisfied. Although Moore has observed some physical similairites between the character and herself, she maintains that Rapunzel's appearance was developed long before she became involved with the project, dismissing any similarities as [...] "coincidental".|$|E

2500|$|Television critic Andrew Dansby compares Parsons's {{physical}} comedy {{to that of}} Buster Keaton {{and other}} silent film stars. Lorre praises Parsons' instincts, saying that [...] "You can't teach that." [...] Lorre describes Parsons' [...] "great sense of control over every part of his body, the way he walks, holds his hands, cocks his head, the facial tics as 'inspired'." [...] Reviewer Lewis Beale describes Parsons' performance as [...] "so spot-on, {{it seems as if}} the character and the actor are the same person." [...] Parsons admits that the work is [...] "more effort than <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> a sitcom would take. And that's really the fun of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|After obtaining his BA, Jackman {{completed}} the one-year course [...] "The Journey" [...] at the Actors' Centre in Sydney. About studying acting full-time, he stated, [...] "It wasn't until I was 22 that <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> about my hobby being something I {{could make a}} living out of. As a boy, I'd always {{had an interest in}} theatre. But the idea at my school was that drama and music were to round out the man. It wasn't what one did for a living. I got over that. I found the courage to stand up and say, 'I want to do it'." [...] After completing [...] "The Journey", he was offered a role on the popular soap opera Neighbours but turned it down to attend the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts of Edith Cowan University in Perth, Western Australia, from which he graduated in 1994.|$|E
2500|$|Gloria Foster, {{instead of}} searching for fame by trying to be in many {{different}} productions, searched for roles in which {{she would be able}} to perform at the best of her ability. [...] She once said, [...] "Young people today, I think, are thinking in terms of stepping stones.â€¦I don't know that <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>thought</b> that way. [...] It sounds ridiculous, but I was always thinking in terms of a more difficult role". [...] She won fame by performing her roles magnificently, not by performing the maximum number of roles that she could. [...] She read many scripts, but only chose the ones that spoke truly to her. [...] By the end of her acting career, she was rewarded with three Obie awards, for In White America (1963) and A Raisin In the Sun, and was in the Broadway production of Having Our Say (1995).|$|E
