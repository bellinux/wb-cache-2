Almost everything in this section generalizes mutatis mutandis to the case of local sections of a <b>fibre</b> <b>bundle,</b> a Banach bundle over a Banach manifold, a fibered manifold, or quasi-coherent sheaves over schemes. Furthermore, these examples of possible generalizations are certainly not exhaustive.|$|E
25|$|This section {{begins by}} {{introducing}} {{the notion of}} jets of functions from the real line to a manifold. It proves that such jets form a <b>fibre</b> <b>bundle,</b> analogous to the tangent bundle, which is an associated bundle of a jet group. It proceeds {{to address the problem}} of defining the jet of a function between two smooth manifolds. Throughout this section, we adopt an analytic approach to jets. Although an algebro-geometric approach is also suitable for many more applications, it is too subtle to be dealt with systematically here. See jet (algebraic geometry) for more details.|$|E

2500|$|Connections are {{of central}} {{importance}} in modern geometry {{in large part}} because they allow a comparison between the local geometry at one point and the local geometry at another point. [...] Differential geometry embraces several variations on the connection theme, which fall into two major groups: the infinitesimal and the local theory. [...] The local theory concerns itself primarily with notions of parallel transport and holonomy. [...] The infinitesimal theory concerns itself with the differentiation of geometric data. [...] Thus a covariant derivative is a way of specifying a derivative of a vector field along another vector field on a manifold. [...] A Cartan connection is a way of formulating some aspects of connection theory using differential forms and Lie groups. [...] An Ehresmann connection is a connection in a <b>fibre</b> <b>bundle</b> or a principal bundle by specifying the allowed directions of motion of the field.

2500|$|The Sudanese Möbius {{band in the}} three-sphere S3 is geometrically a <b>fibre</b> <b>bundle</b> over a great circle, whose fibres {{are great}} semicircles. [...] The most {{symmetrical}} image of a stereographic projection of this band into R3 is obtained by using a projection point that lies on that great circle {{that runs through the}} midpoint of each of the semicircles. Each choice of such a projection point results in an image that is congruent to any other. But because such a projection point lies on the Möbius band itself, two aspects of the image are significantly different from the case (illustrated above) where the point is not on the band: 1) the image in R3 is not the full Möbius band, but rather the band with one point removed (from its centerline); and 2) the image is unbounded – and as it gets increasingly far from the origin of R3, it increasingly approximates a plane. [...] Yet this version of the stereographic image has a group of 4 symmetries in R3 (it is isomorphic to the Klein 4-group), as compared with the bounded version illustrated above having its group of symmetries the unique group of order 2. (If all symmetries and not just orientation-preserving isometries of R3 are allowed, the numbers of symmetries in each case doubles.) ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} a {{thorough}} analysis {{of physical and}} fine structure of hemp <b>fibre</b> <b>bundles,</b> namely surface topography, diameter, cellulose content and crystallinity index, have been presented. The <b>fibre</b> <b>bundles</b> have been alkalised and physical and mechanical properties analysed. Alkalisation was found to change the surface topography of <b>fibre</b> <b>bundles</b> and the diameter decreased with increased concentration of caustic soda. Cellulose content increase slightly at lower NaCH concentrations and decrease at higher NaOH concentrations. The crystallinity index decrease with increase in caustic soda concentration up to 0. 24 % NaOH beyond which, it decreases with increase in NaOH concentration. It was {{also found that the}} tensile strength and stiffness increases with increase in the concentration of NaOH up to a limit. Tensile strength and Young's modulus increase with decrease in cellulose content, while crystalline cellulose decreases slightly but with improved crystalline packing order resulting in increased mechanical properties. Similar observations are elucidated by the crystallinity index. Alkalised hemp <b>fibre</b> <b>bundles</b> were found to exhibit a similar specific stiffness to steel, E-glass and Kevlar 29 fibres. The results also show that crystallinity index obtained following alkalisation has a reverse correlation to the mechanical properties. Stiffer alkalised hemp <b>fibre</b> <b>bundles</b> are suitable candidates as reinforcements to replace synthetic fibres. The improvement in mechanical properties of alkali treated hemp <b>fibre</b> <b>bundles</b> confirms their use as reinforcement materials. (c) 2006 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an initial computational multiscale modelling of the fibre-reinforced composite materials. This study will constitute an initial building block of the computational framework, {{developed for the}} DURCOMP (providing confidence in durable composites) EPSRC project, {{the ultimate goal of}} which is the use of advance composites in the construction industry, while concentrating on its major limiting factor " durability ". The use of multiscale modelling gives directly the macroscopic constitutive behaviour of the structures based on its microscopically heterogeneous representative volume element (RVE). The RVE is analysed using the University of Glasgow in-house parallel computational tool, MoFEM (Mesh Oriented Finite Element Method), which is a C++ based finite-element code. A single layered plain weave is used to model the textile geometry. The geometry of the RVE mainly consists of two parts, the <b>fibre</b> <b>bundles</b> and matrix, and is modelled with CUBIT, which is a software package for the creation of parameterised geometries and meshes. Elliptical cross sections and cubic splines are used respectively to model the cross sections and paths of the <b>fibre</b> <b>bundles,</b> which are the main components of the yarn geometry. In this analysis, transversely isotropic material is introduced for the <b>fibre</b> <b>bundles,</b> and elastic material is used for the matrix part. The directions of the <b>fibre</b> <b>bundles</b> are calculated using a potential flow analysis across the <b>fibre</b> <b>bundles,</b> which are then used to define the principal direction for the transversely isotropic material.
