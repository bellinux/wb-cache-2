5000|$|The {{boat was}} {{designed}} with amas {{connected to the}} main hull by rigid decks. The outer hulls and decks could fold down for trailering. Accommodations included seating for up to eight on benches that convert to 4 single bunks, one bunk extending to a double, galley, dining table, and a marine toilet in the <b>forecabin.</b> The estimated top speed was 15 knots.|$|E
50|$|Following {{this period}} of fleet {{modernisation}} were ten years of stability, with the two 'castles' on the Dartmouth-Totnes run, the Dolphin on the Kingswear ferry, and the three screw steamers assisting. At this time the single fare to Totnes was one shillingin the saloon, or ninepence in the <b>forecabin.</b> In 1893 the Dart was sold, and a new paddle steamer: the first PS Totnes Castle entered service. Designed for the winter run, this vessel was smaller than the other paddle steamers, and was flush-decked. The Hauley was sold in 1898.|$|E
50|$|Substantial guard rails are {{constructed}} from 316 marine grade stainless steel and are through-bolted for security. Stainless steel self stowing stemhead fitting, housing a 16 kg Delta anchor with 30m of 8mm calibrated chain. Manual anchor winch. 6 substantial cleats. Stainless steel grab rails {{on the side}} of the flybridge. Stainless steel/teak bathing platform access ladder. A full set of IMCO navigation lights. Twin electric horns. Fuel and water filters. Hatch for gas bottle stowage (2 bottles). Hatch access to chain locker with stowage space. Hatch to <b>forecabin.</b> Stainless steel guard wires to access openings in side deck guard rails. Bathing ladder.|$|E
5000|$|Unusually {{for such}} a {{relatively}} short hull, the Corvette has 2 heads - forward, between the two <b>forecabin</b> berths, and aft, in the double master cabin. Although this might seem extravagant on such a relatively short boat, the arrangement works extremely well for guests, having their own private [...] "en-suite" [...] totally separate from the master cabin. Much has been said of the beam, but this also is of benefit in creating a good impression of space in the cabins. The unfashionably large windows by contemporary standards also provide excellent visibility and light. The saloon is a little compromised by incorporating the galley, which itself could be better equipped ergonomically, but boat design is always a compromise.|$|E
50|$|Fairlie {{brought a}} number of other {{innovative}} and highly effective features to the design. For instance, the forestay is bolted right through the hull and secured with a bolt hidden at the centre of a bronze casting of a thistle which becomes a feature of the bow. The shrouds and backstay are secured to u-bolts through the deck, eliminating the need for rigging screws. The u-bolts provide a compression packing that can be screwed down tight, and owners report that they seldom leak. The deck is moulded with a lip that turns up to fit inside the hull moulding, and after being glued and glassed in, the join is covered with a custom-designed vinyl moulding that eliminates the common problem of deck/hull leaks, and also serves as a practical rubbing strake. The mast is deck-stepped on an aluminium channel that sits above the two main internal bulkheads - a solution that allows easy passage below decks to the <b>forecabin,</b> while ensuring a solid base for the mast. Many of the boats were delivered with an outboard engine that was mounted in a cutout in the rear cockpit bench seat and could be removed and stowed below the cockpit - a configuration that was later adopted in other production yachts. These models were also delivered with an arch in the companionway cutout instead of a sliding hatchway, thus simplifying construction, retaining bulkhead strength and removing another possible source of leaks.|$|E
