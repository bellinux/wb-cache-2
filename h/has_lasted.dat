5|$|The highly {{decorative}} Sicilian Baroque period lasted barely fifty years, {{and perfectly}} reflected {{the social order}} of the island at a time when, nominally ruled by Spain, {{it was in fact}} governed by a wealthy and often extravagant aristocracy into whose hands ownership of the primarily agricultural economy was highly concentrated. Its Baroque architecture gives the island an architectural character that <b>has</b> <b>lasted</b> into the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|Exercise {{appears to}} be useful for {{preventing}} low back pain. Exercise is also probably effective in preventing recurrences in those with pain that <b>has</b> <b>lasted</b> more than six weeks. Medium-firm mattresses are more beneficial for chronic pain than firm mattresses. There is little to no evidence that back belts are any more helpful in preventing low back pain than education about proper lifting techniques. Shoe insoles do not help prevent low back pain.|$|E

Jerry is a very good influence on the dressing room as well and I'm delighted that he will be staying with us.|$|E

During the next 150 years, England would fight with Spain, the Netherlands, and France {{for control of the}} continent, while religious division in Ireland between Protestant and Catholic <b>has</b> <b>lasted</b> for 400 years.

5|$|Complaints of {{low back}} pain {{are one of the}} most common reasons people visit doctors. For pain that <b>has</b> <b>lasted</b> only a few weeks, the pain is likely to subside on its own. Thus, if a person's medical history and {{physical}} examination do not suggest a specific disease as the cause, medical societies advise against imaging tests such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs. Individuals may want such tests but, unless red flags are present, they are unnecessary health care. Routine imaging increases costs, is associated with higher rates of surgery with no overall benefit, and the radiation used may be harmful to one's health. Fewer than 1% of imaging tests identify the cause of the problem. Imaging may also detect harmless abnormalities, encouraging people to request further unnecessary testing or to worry. Even so, MRI scans of the lumbar region increased by more than 300% among United States Medicare beneficiaries from 1994 to 2006.|$|E

5|$|Recruited {{by several}} firms in 1975, Romney joined the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), {{reasoning}} that {{working as a}} management consultant {{for a variety of}} companies would better prepare him for a future position as a chief executive. Part of a 1970s wave of top graduates who chose to go into consulting rather than join a large company directly, he found his legal and business education useful in his job. He applied BCG principles such as the growth-share matrix, and executives viewed him as having a bright future there. At the Boston Consulting Group, he was a colleague of Benjamin Netanyahu, with whom he formed a friendship that <b>has</b> <b>lasted</b> for more than forty years.|$|E
5|$|The player kills enemies {{by firing}} daggers from their fingers. There are two firing options: {{clicking}} the left-mouse button fires a shotgun-like blast of daggers {{with a wide}} spread, and holding the mouse button down fires a precise, continuous stream of daggers. Some enemies have weak spots indicated by red crystals on their bodies. Once dead, the red crystals are dropped and can be gathered by the player to obtain attack upgrades, such as increased damage and homing daggers. The player dies when coming into physical contact with an enemy or falling off the stage. At {{the top of the}} screen, a timer displays how long the playthrough <b>has</b> <b>lasted.</b> The player's best survival time is published on a global leaderboard. Accessed via the leaderboard, replays of playthroughs can be downloaded and watched from either a first-person view or a top-down perspective.|$|E
5|$|Vortigaunts {{are very}} {{intelligent}} and social creatures. In Half-Life, {{they serve as}} basic ground units for the Xen forces, often supporting heavier troops fighting the player and the humans in the Black Mesa Research Facility. They are capable of developing intelligent strategies and tactics to take on their enemies. Initially, Vortigaunts are enslaved to the Nihilanth, a large creature on Xen, who, in turn, claims it is a slave to unknown superiors. On Xen, the Vortigaunts are used as factory workers and drones. In Half-Life 2, Vortigaunts indicate that this slavery <b>has</b> <b>lasted</b> for generations. Despite this, Vortigaunts are shown to have developed an intellectual culture, valuing poetry, music and philosophy. In addition, Vortigaunts practise the husbandry of antlions, large insectoids that live in underground hives, as an ancestral tradition. The death of the Nihilanth {{at the hands of}} Gordon Freeman at the end of Half-Life frees the Vortigaunts from their slavery; consequently the Vortigaunts see Freeman as a messianic figure.|$|E

5|$|The most cycles hit by {{a player}} in Nippon Professional Baseball is three, {{accomplished}} by Bobby Rose. Playing for the Yokohama BayStars, Rose hit his first cycle on May 2, 1995, the next on April 29, 1997, and his final cycle on June 30, 1999. Other than Rose, only three other NPB players have hit multiple cycles: Fumio Fujimura with the Osaka Tigers and Hiromi Matsunaga with the Hankyu/Orix Braves and Kosuke Fukudome with the Chunichi Dragons and the Hanshin Tigers, all with two. Fujimura is also the only player to have hit a cycle during both the single league era and the current dual league era. The 2003 NPB season saw the most cycles hit in a single season—five. That season also saw the only instance of cycles occurring in two different games on the same day: on July 1, hit by Atsunori Inaba of the Yakult Swallows and Arihito Muramatsu of the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks. The next day, Shinjiro Hiyama became the third player to hit for the cycle in two days. Conversely, the longest period of time between two players hitting for the cycle is one day shy of 6years. The drought <b>has</b> <b>lasted</b> from Michihiro Ogasawara's cycle in 2008 until Rainel Rosario's in 2014.|$|E

After {{his first marriage}} to Julia Newman (Meg Bennett), he formed a romance with stripper Nikki Reed (Melody Thomas Scott). Their union developed into a supercouple pairing, which <b>has</b> <b>lasted</b> over three decades. He shares two children with Nikki, Victoria (Amelia Heinle) and Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow). During his first marriage to her, he cheated with Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson). He has also had a long-standing romantic history with Ashley, and they share a child together, Abby Newman (Melissa Ordway). He was briefly married to a woman named Hope Wilson (Signy Coleman) {{and they had a}} son together, Adam Newman (Justin Hartley), who grew up without knowledge of Victor being his father. He is also known for his long-standing business rivalry with Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman). Victor has had several other romantic relationships, including one with his former daughter-in-law Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), which was poorly received by the actors and public.|$|E

40|$|SummaryWe {{examined}} {{activity in}} the frontal cortex as monkeys performed a duration-discrimination task. Two stimuli, one red and the other blue, appeared sequentially on a video screen—in either order. Later, both stimuli reappeared, and to receive a reward the monkeys had to choose the stimulus that <b>had</b> <b>lasted</b> longer during its initial presentation. Some neurons encoded stimulus duration, but {{a larger number of}} cells represented their relative duration, which was encoded in three ways: whether the first or second stimulus <b>had</b> <b>lasted</b> longer; whether the red or blue stimulus <b>had</b> <b>lasted</b> longer; or, less commonly, as {{the difference between the two}} durations. As the monkeys' choice approached, the signal encoding which stimulus (red or blue) <b>had</b> <b>lasted</b> longer increased as the order-based signal dissipated. By representing stimulus durations and relative durations—both bound to stimulus features and event order—the frontal cortex could contribute to both temporal perception and episodic memory...|$|R
