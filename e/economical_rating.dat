40|$|The {{ability of}} wind {{generation}} to remain {{connected to the}} grid {{in the event of}} system faults and dynamic reactive power compensation are two aspects of grid integration, which have received particular attention. The wind driven, fixed-speed induction generator (FSIG) on its own fails to fulfil these requirements of grid integration. The application of a unified power quality conditioner (UPQC) to overcome the grid integration problems of the FSIG is investigated. The role of the UPQC in enhancing the fault ride-through capability of the generator is also investigated under both full and partial terminal voltage restoration. A realistic estimation of the rating requirements of UPQC for this type of application is carried out. A general principle is presented to choose the most practical and <b>economical</b> <b>rating</b> of the UPQC. The performance comparison of a UPQC and a static synchronous compensator to aid fault ride-through capability of a 2 MW FSIG under Irish grid code requirements has been carried out and the UPQC is found to be more economical in relation to device rating...|$|E

The recent novel development in membrane processes have made it possible to use various different purposes at <b>economical</b> <b>rates</b> with additional flexibility and improved efficiencies. Regarding the membrane separation processes, concentration polarization {{is one of the biggest}} problem. It causes reduction of permeate flux and deterioration of permeate quality. Accumulation of rejected species can be suppressed by creating back mixing from the membrane to the bulk of the liquid. Various hydrodynamic approaches have been developed for that purpose. Feed spacers can provide higher shear rates at the membrane surface, which, promote the mixing between the bulk of the fluid and the fluid element adjacent to the membrane surface. As a result concentration polarization and membrane fouling can be reduced. The present work is devoted to investigate the hydrodynamics in two dimensional single spacer filled channels. Two different configurations of the cylindrical spacers are investigated with different channel Reynolds number.

The signal is transmitted through the channel and it is received at the receiver end. Then the receiver removes these additional bits {{in order to minimize}} the inter symbol interference, to improve the bit error rate and to reduce the power spectrum.

These include low index, high transmittance, good adhesion, and environmental durability. The deposition of the material from solid discs or granular forms using an electron beam gun tends to have a fluctuating angular distribution.

40|$|Abstract: Carbon {{nanomaterials}} {{are getting}} importance in various {{applications such as}} hydrogen storage, fuel cell, electron field emitter etc. In {{order to make the}} cost of the gadgets utilizing carbon nanomaterials economical, efforts are being made to synthesize them at lowest possible cost. In addition, most of the processes which are being developed use precursors which are derived from petroleum products, which is destined to get depleted one day. Hence, synthesis of carbon nanomaterials based on such precursors will also get depleted and the technology based on carbon nanomaterials will come to a halt. Considering these two factors, we are making efforts to search for precursors which are plant derived and could give the desired type of products at an <b>economical</b> <b>rate.</b> Another advantage of using precursors derived from plant based materials like oil seeds, plant fibers (coconut fiber or bagasse etc) is that these materials possesses different types of morphology e. g. channel type hollow cylindrical fibers, or various types of structures having various orientation of pores etc. These varied morphologies may have some useful properties like storing of hydrogen gas, intercalating of lithium etc. Moreover, such type of structure would be extremely difficult to synthesize in laboratory.

The main objective of this Project {{is to reduce the}} cost of the required steam, per Barrel of Oil produced. This is made possible by a combination of Patented new technologies with several known methods. The best known method for increasing the production rate from oil wells is to use horizontal drainholes, which provide a much greater flow area from the oil zone into the well. A recent statistic based on 344 horizontal wells in 21 Canadian Oil fields containing Heavy Oil shows that these are, on the average six times more prolific than vertical wells. The cost of horizontal wells, however, is generally two to three times that of a vertical well, in the same field, so our second goal is to reduce the net cost of horizontal wells by connecting two of them to the same vertical casing, well head and pumping system. With such a well configuration, it is possible to get two horizontal wells for the price of about one and a half times the price of a single vertical well...|$|R
