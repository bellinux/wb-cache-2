Luke Smith of NBC Sports wrote that Pahkala's penalty was [...] "deeply embarrassing <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who looked to make the inaugural eRace such a success" [...] and likened it to [...] "Balance of Performance on steroids." [...] He {{went on to say}} that although the event had not been as smooth as organizers wished, he noted that Formula E had made progress towards an eSports series that could grow in popularity in the future. The Checkered Flags Scott Douglas was more critical, writing that as a competition, the race was [...] "a disappointment" [...] since it had been expected to be dominated by sim racers, and its problems hurt the race result's credibility: [...] "This undermined the race as a competition, and also did nothing to help the reputation of Formula E itself as its best drivers were so resoundingly beaten. It lacked any sense of real weight or drama, and tied in with the glitches effecting some of the drivers it didn’t come anywhere near to producing the excitement of real racing." [...] Writing for Ars Technica, Jonathan M. Gitlin felt short-changed as a result of spectating the eRace and noted the large number of complaints about the quality of the graphics in the Twitch stream.|$|E
