50|$|Boritzer gained {{national}} {{critical acclaim}} after <b>What</b> <b>is</b> God? {{was published in}} 1989 although the book has caused controversy from religious fundamentalists for its universalist views. The other current books in the <b>What</b> <b>is?</b> series include <b>What</b> <b>is</b> Love?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> Death?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> Beautiful?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> Funny?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> Right?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> Peace?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> Money?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> Dreaming?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> a Friend?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> True?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> a Family?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> a Feeling? The series is now also translated into 15 languages. Boritzer {{was first published in}} 1963 at the age of 13 when he wrote an essay in his English class at Wade Junior High School in the Bronx, New York on the assassination of John F. Kennedy. His essay was included in a special anthology by New York City public school children compiled and published by the New York City Department of Education.|$|R

5|$|Non-reductive Physicalism is {{the view}} that mental {{properties}} form a separate ontological class to physical properties: mental states (such as qualia) are not reducible to physical states. The ontological stance towards qualia {{in the case of}} non-reductive physicalism does not imply that qualia are causally inert; this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> distinguishes it from epiphenomenalism.|$|E
5|$|Some eye defects may {{naturally}} {{change for}} the better with age or in cycles (ophthalmologist Stewart Duke-Elder suggested that this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> happened with Aldous Huxley). A cataract when first setting in sometimes results in much improved eyesight for a short time. One who happens to have been practicing the Bates method will likely credit it for any improvement experienced regardless of the actual cause.|$|E

5|$|Weather, {{seen from}} an anthropological perspective, is {{something}} all humans {{in the world}} constantly experience through their senses, at least while being outside.

5|$|Another key {{aspect of}} SIM Lite's mission was {{determining}} {{the upper and}} lower limits of star's masses. Today, scientists understand that there are limits to the how small or large a star can be. Objects that are too small lack the internal pressure to initiate thermonuclear fusion, which <b>is</b> <b>what</b> causes a star to shine. These objects are known as brown dwarfs and represent {{the lower end of the}} stellar mass scale. Stars that are too large become unstable and explode in a supernova.|$|E
5|$|I was in Russia, then Germany, {{and spent}} a lot of time in Eastern Europe. There is this amazing German house-techno music, so I wanted to make a pop {{experimental}} record. I kind of wanted to leave the '80s a little bit, so the chorus is a '90s melody, which <b>is</b> <b>what</b> the inspiration was. There was certainly some whisky involved in the writing of the record. It's about being in love with your best friend.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{contentious}} issues amongst islanders {{in the 21st century}} <b>is</b> <b>what</b> to do about the rodent situation.

There is a plan to drop 42 tonnes of rat bait across the island but the community is heavily divided.|$|E

5000|$|For Aristotle, logos is {{something}} more refined than the capacity to make private feelings public: it enables the human being to perform as no other animal can; it {{makes it possible for}} him to perceive and make clear to others through reasoned discourse the difference between <b>what</b> <b>is</b> advantageous and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> harmful, between <b>what</b> <b>is</b> just and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> unjust, and between <b>what</b> <b>is</b> good and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> evil.|$|R
5|$|Sexual {{encounters}} at bathhouses are frequently, but not always, anonymous.

Bathhouses are still used by {{men who have sex}} with men and do not identify as gay or bisexual, including those that are closeted or in heterosexual relationships.|$|E
5|$|The {{apparent}} {{brightness of}} a star is {{expressed in terms of}} its apparent magnitude.

Intrinsic or absolute magnitude is directly related to a star's luminosity, and <b>is</b> <b>what</b> the apparent magnitude a star would be if the distance between the Earth and the star were 10 parsecs (32.6 light-years).|$|E
5|$|The {{land that}} the Glidden House stands on <b>is</b> <b>what</b> remains of Joseph Glidden's once large DeKalb County farm.

The Glidden Farm went as far north as today's Lucinda Avenue. The farm's south border, near where Glidden would grant the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad right-of-way through DeKalb in the early 1990s was near present-day Taylor Street.|$|E
