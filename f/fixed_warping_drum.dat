Even a small difference in link size or consistency can cause undue wear on the chainwheel and/or cause the chain to jump off the windlass when the winch is operating, particularly during payout, a runaway condition sometimes referred to as [...] "water spouting" [...] should it occur at high speed. Nowadays, especially on large tankers and cruise ships, the windlass may be split into independent port and starboard units. In these cases they are frequently coupled with <b>warping</b> <b>drums</b> (as distinct from warping heads).

By supposing that the slab loss of planarity is described by a <b>fixed</b> <b>warping</b> function, the vertical and longitudinal displacements of the generic cross section {{and the intensity of}} the warping (shear-lag function) are assumed as unknowns of the problem. Integrating by parts the global balance condition obtained by the virtual work principle, three linear integral differential equations (expressing local equilibrium) with the relevant boundary conditions are obtained.

40|$|Taking {{into account}} the {{long-term}} behavior of the concrete, a model for analyzing the shear-lag effect in composite beams with flexible shear connection is proposed. By assuming the slab loss of planarity described by a <b>fixed</b> <b>warping</b> function, the linear kinematics of the composite beam is expressed by means of four unknown functions: the vertical displacement of the whole cross section; the axial displacements of the concrete slab and of the steel beam; {{and the intensity of}} the warping (shear-lag function). A variational balance condition is imposed by the virtual work theorem for three-dimensional bodies, from which the local formulation of the problem, which involves four equilibrium equations with the relevant boundary conditions, is achieved. The assumptions of linear elastic behavior for the steel beam and the shear connection and of linear viscoelastic behavior for the concrete slab lead to an integral-differential type system, which is numerically integrated. The numerical procedure, based on the step-by-step general method and the finite-difference method, is illustrated and applied to an example of practical interest...|$|R
40|$|The inner {{region of}} the {{accretion}} disk around a magnetized star (T Tauri star, white dwarf or neutron star) is subjected to magnetic torques that induce warping and precession of the disk. These torques arise from {{the interaction between the}} stellar field and the induced electric currents in the disk. We carry out numerical simulations of the nonlinear evolution of warped, viscous accretion disks driven by the magnetic torques. We show that the disk can develop into a highly warped steady state in which the disk attains a <b>fixed</b> (<b>warped)</b> shape and precesses rigidly. The warp is most pronounced at the disk inner radius (near the magnetosphere boundary). As the system parameters (such as accretion rate) change, the disk can switch between a completely flat state (warping stable) and a highly warped state. The precession of warped disks may be responsible for a variety of quasi-periodic oscillations or radiation flux variabilities observed in many different systems, including young stellar objects and X-ray binaries.

40|$|Time series {{classification}} is a {{supervised learning}} problem aimed at labeling temporally structured multivariate sequences of variable length. The most common approach reduces time series classification to a static problem by suitably transforming {{the set of}} multivariate input sequences into a rectangular table composed by a fixed number of columns. Then, one of the alternative efficient methods for classification is applied for predicting the class of new temporal sequences. In this paper, we propose a new classification method, based on a temporal extension of discrete support vector machines, that benefits from the notions of warping distance and softened variable margin. Furthermore, in order to transform a temporal dataset into a rectangular shape, we also develop a new method based on <b>fixed</b> cardinality <b>warping</b> distances.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a unified {{framework}} for computing atlases from manually labeled data at {{various degrees of}} “sharpness ” and the joint registration-segmentation of a new brain with these atlases. In non-rigid registration, the tradeoff between warp regularization and image fidelity is typically set empirically. In segmentation, {{this leads to a}} probabilistic atlas of arbitrary “sharpness”: weak regularization results in well-aligned training images and a “sharp” atlas; strong regularization yields a “blurry” atlas. We study the effects of this tradeoff in the context of cortical surface parcellation by comparing three special cases of our framework, namely: progressive registration-segmentation of a new brain to increasingly “sharp” atlases with increasingly flexible warps; secondly, progressive registration to a single atlas with increasingly flexible warps; and thirdly, registration to a single atlas with <b>fixed</b> constrained <b>warps.</b> The optimal parcellation in all three cases corresponds to a unique balance of atlas “sharpness ” and warp regularization that yield statistically significant improvements over the previously demonstrated parcellation results...|$|R

We show that the requirements of a vanishingly small cosmological constant on the visible brane along with non-hierarchical moduli, each with scale close to Planck length, lead to a scenario where the 3 -branes can not have any intermediate scale and have energy scales either close to Tev or close to Planck scale. Such a scenario can address both the gauge hierarchy as well as fermion mass hierarchy problem in standard model. Thus simultaneous resolutions to these problems are closely linked with the near flatness condition of our universe without any intermediate hierarchical scale for the moduli.

The border therefore appears as separately woven and then stitched to the body of the sari. Some times a separate pallu warp is twisted on the body. The end piece has fine silk. Warp threads are only of zari forming a golden ground upon which angular, brightly coloured silk designs are woven in the interlocked weft, producing a tapestry effect.|$|R

40|$|Graphics {{processing}} units, or GPUs, {{have gradually}} increased in computational {{power from the}} small, job-specific boards of the early 1990 s to the programmable powerhouses of today. Compared to more common central processing units, or CPUs, GPUs have a higher aggregate memory bandwidth, much higher floating-point operations per second (FLOPS), and lower energy consumption per FLOP. Because {{one of the main}} obstacles in exascale computing is power consumption, many new supercomputing platforms are gaining much of their computational capacity by incorporating GPUs into their compute nodes. Since CPU-optimized parallel algorithms are not directly portable to GPU architectures (or at least not without losing substantial performance), transport codes need to be rewritten to execute efficiently on GPUs. Unless this is done, reactor simulations cannot take full advantage of these new supercomputers. WARP, which can stand for ``Weaving All the Random Particles,'' is a three-dimensional (3 D) continuous energy Monte Carlo neutron transport code developed in this work as to efficiently implement a continuous energy Monte Carlo neutron transport algorithm on a GPU. WARP accelerates Monte Carlo simulations while preserving the benefits of using the Monte Carlo Method, namely, very few physical and geometrical simplifications. WARP is able to calculate multiplication factors, flux tallies, and fission source distributions for time-independent problems, and can run in both criticality or <b>fixed</b> source modes. <b>WARP</b> can transport neutrons in unrestricted arrangements of parallelepipeds, hexagonal prisms, cylinders, and spheres. WARP uses an event-based algorithm, but with some important differences. Moving data is expensive, so WARP uses a remapping vector of pointer/index pairs to direct GPU threads to the data they need to access. The remapping vector is sorted by reaction type after every transport iteration using a high-efficiency parallel radix sort, which serves to keep the reaction types as contiguous as possible and removes completed histories from the transport cycle. The sort reduces the amount of divergence in GPU ``thread blocks,'' keeps the SIMD units as full as possible, and eliminates using memory bandwidth to check if a neutron in the batch has been terminated or not. Using a remapping vector means the data access pattern is irregular, but this is mitigated by using large batch sizes where the GPU can effectively eliminate the high cost of irregular global memory access. WARP modifies the standard unionized energy grid implementation to reduce memory traffic. Instead of storing a matrix of pointers indexed by reaction type and energy, WARP stores three matrices. The first contains cross section values, the second contains pointers to angular distributions, and a third contains pointers to energy distributions. This linked list type of layout increases memory usage, but lowers the number of data loads that are needed to determine a reaction by eliminating a pointer load to find a cross section value. Optimized, high-performance GPU code libraries are also used by WARP wherever possible. The CUDA performance primitives (CUDPP) library is used to perform the parallel reductions, sorts and sums, the CURAND library is used to seed the linear congruential random number generators, and the OptiX ray tracing framework is used for geometry representation. OptiX is a highly-optimized library developed by NVIDIA that automatically builds hierarchical acceleration structures around user-input geometry so only surfaces along a ray line need to be queried in ray tracing. WARP also performs material and cell number queries with OptiX by using a point-in-polygon like algorithm. In the initial testing where 10 ^ 6 source neutrons per criticality batch are used, WARP is capable of delivering results that are anywhere from 4 to 800 pcm away from MCNP 6. 1 and Serpent 2. 1. 18, but with run times that are 11 - 82 times lower, depending on problem geometry and materials. On average, WARP's performance on a NIVIDIA K 20 is equivalent to approximately 45 AMD Opteron 6172 CPU cores. Larger batches are typically perform better on the GPU, but memory limitations of the K 20 card restricted batch size to $ 10 ^ 6 $ source neutrons. WARP has shown that GPUs are an effective platform for performing Monte Carlo neutron transport with continuous energy cross sections. Currently, WARP is the most detailed and feature-rich program in existence for performing continuous energy Monte Carlo neutron transport in general 3 D geometries on GPUs, but compared to production codes like Serpent and MCNP, WARP has limited capabilities. Despite WARP's lack of features, its novel algorithm implementations show that high performance can be achieved on a GPU despite the inherently divergent program flow and sparse data access patterns. WARP is not ready for everyday nuclear reactor calculations, but is a good platform for further development of GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo neutron transport. In it's current state, it may be a useful tool for multiplication factor searches, i. e. determining reactivity coefficients by perturbing material densities or temperatures, since these types of calculations typically do not require many flux tallies...|$|R
