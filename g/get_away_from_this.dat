2500|$|Variety: [...] "You can't <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> Clara Bow girl. She {{certainly}} has that certain 'It'...and she just runs {{away with the}} film." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, to the West, or to England, or to Germany, where {{father came}} from--anywhere to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> Valley of Fear!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I'd do {{anything}} to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this.</b> You'll never regret what you've done, Philip, never. When can I come, Philip?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you have}} any plan of escape in mind, do not tell me of it," [...] {{continued}} the captain. [...] "I shall order the launches guarded carefully. I shall do all {{in my power to}} prevent your <b>getting</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> ship." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{left that}} unanswered. She had a curious {{feeling that there}} was no <b>getting</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> splashing, {{babbling}} pool, that she was fixed there until Mr. Magnet chose to release her, and that he didn't mean to release her yet. In which case she would go on refusing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now we must lose {{no time in}} <b>getting</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> place, and {{covering}} {{as much of the}} desert as we can during the night," [...] said Miles, [...] "for it strikes me that we'll have to lie quiet during the day, for fear of being seen and chased." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O Cassy! do tell me,--couldn't we <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> place? I don't care where,--into {{the swamp}} among the snakes,--anywhere! Couldn't we get somewhere away from here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was hard}} to deal with such ravings. [...] "The thing we have to think of now," [...] said I, [...] "is how to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> island." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{permit me}} to say you're no judge," [...] {{declared}} Cap'n Bill. [...] "But you haven't answered my question, friend Ork. How are we to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> mountain?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We can {{go after}} a fortune that is coming to Roger Morr's mother. It's the Landslide Mine, and it's lost. Haskers, if we can locate that mine, our {{fortunes}} are made! Come on, and I'll {{tell you all about}} it while we are <b>getting</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> place. We must go West just as fast as we can make it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you see how}} {{intolerable}} {{all that}} is going to be for me?" [...] he asked, with bitter gravity. [...] "I can see that she isn't exactly human even to you. She's just a sort of a freak. No one loves her or seeks her for herself alone, only for what she can do. That's another reason why I must insist on her <b>getting</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this.</b> I will not have her treated like a wireless telephone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am quite}} sure, Guert, I am as little {{disposed}} to brag of my share in this affair, as you or any one can possibly be; {{but it is}} much easier to talk about <b>getting</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> confused crowd than really to do the thing. I doubt if any of these boats will take us in; for an Englishman, flogged, is not apt to be very good-natured; and all our friends seem to be killed or wounded." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Unless they {{understood}} what damage {{might be done}} by such storms they must be, and it stands us in hand to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> spot before others can arrive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well;--I fancy {{there is}} {{something}} amiss. I can't move my arms; and I catch my breath. My legs are all right if I could <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> accursed brute." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Haul him {{in by the}} ear if he won't come!" [...] roared Captain Hannock. [...] "We can't {{afford to}} waste time on him. The sooner we <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> harbor the better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "it's now or never, Miss Rose. If the brig once <b>gets</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> {{anchorage}} without me, I {{may never}} lay {{eyes on her}} ag'in. Her time is nearly up, for wood and iron wont hold together always, any more than flesh and blood. Consider how many years I've been busy in huntin' her up, and how hard 't will be to lose that which has given me so many weary days and sleepless nights to find." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are left," [...] I said, [...] "without {{the means}} of <b>getting</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> place. In two hours more the tide will be in my favor, and I shall sail at once on the return voyage. We part, this time, never to meet again. Before I go I am {{resolved}} to leave you properly provided for. My money is in my traveling-bag in the cabin. For that reason, I am obliged {{to ask you to}} go with me as far as the boat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think, governor, {{that there}} is any great danger of a mutiny; though, many men, many minds, as I said before. But, my {{business}} here is forgotten all this time; and I know it isn't with your honour now {{as it used to be}} with us both, when we had nothing to think of but the means of <b>getting</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> place, into some other that we fancied might be better. I wish you joy, sir, in having got the two new brigs into the water." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh--Bronx Park--gee! Gertie, I can't get up much {{excitement}} over that. I want to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> tame city, {{and forget}} all about offices and parks and people and everything like that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will never}} {{do to stop}} here to boil our pot," [...] cried Roswell to the mate. [...] "We must <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this,</b> Mr. Hazard, {{as fast as the}} good craft can travel!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, please don't say {{anything}} more, Mr. Ashford," [...] interrupted the young lady, [...] "but let us <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> horrid place at once. Do get the horses in. I can't stand it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then King Angus meditated {{upon this}} for a while, and he said: [...] "Tristram, what thou sayest is very well said, but how shall I <b>get</b> you <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> place in safety?" ...|$|R
5000|$|As {{with the}} first Hoodwinked film, many reviews were {{critical}} of the film's animation. In his review for The New York Times, Andy Webster criticized the film's animation, stating [...] "the images don't remotely approach the nuance of, say, Ice Age, let alone anything from the mack daddy, Pixar. And while it seems there's no <b>getting</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> marketing aesthetic, the resemblance at times to a video game is far, far too acute. The Shrek films — in visual terms — have done {{this kind of thing}} better." [...] Michael O’Sullivan of The Washington Post said that the film “suffers from a stylistic stiffness" [...] and called the characters “clunky and ungainly”.|$|R
50|$|Without qualifications, {{he found}} {{work as a}} technician. He would later marry Michelle whom he met in the company where he worked. Both of them harboured the dream of <b>getting</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> urban life {{and thought about the}} {{possibility}} of working in farming. He met a doctor called Pierre Richard, an ecologist and visionary involved at the time {{in the creation of the}} Cévennes National Park, who encouraged them in the steps they took. They then decided to move to the Ardèche department where they have been since 1960. In those years, this was quite an original move to make, because they went well before the French neo-rural movement of the late 1960s.|$|R
6000|$|... "Save me!" [...] he begged. [...] "Help me to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> house! You don't {{belong to}} the police. I'll give you every penny I have {{in the world to}} let me go!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{too much}} luck! Let's <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> side." [...] He almost dragged her on through that too thoughtfully {{regulated}} Park, {{to find some}} cover where they could sit and hold each other's hands.|$|E
6000|$|Some of {{the nearest}} {{drinkers}} at the bar looked round and laughed. Amelius tenderly drew the shawl over the girl's cold bosom. [...] "For God's sake, let us <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> place!" [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{mind about}} that, dear," [...] Chebron said; [...] "we {{will talk about}} all this afterward. The first thing is to <b>get</b> you <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> place. Jethro and Amuba will soon decide what is best to be done. Are there any others in the house?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You and I {{never liked}} each other," [...] she said. [...] "I wrote you a pert letter <b>from</b> <b>this</b> place. I have always taken Anne's part against you. I have shown you plainly--rudely, I dare say--that I {{was glad to}} be married and <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> you. <b>This</b> is not your revenge, is it?" ...|$|R
50|$|The single {{register}} scenes show {{three large}} scenes {{from one side}} of a corridor. The arena of shields is shown, with a crowd of people either climbing a wooded hill for a good view, or <b>getting</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> dangerous activity. At {{the top of the hill}} is a small building carrying a scene showing the king lion-hunting. The king makes ready in his chariot, the horses held by grooms. Huntsmen with large mastiff dogs and spears wait within the arena for any lion that comes too close to the shield-wall. In the large scene with the king hunting in his chariot, a total of 18 lions is shown, mostly dead or wounded. The other side of the corridor had similar scenes with the royal chariot in action shown twice.|$|R
60|$|She {{was alone}} in a maze of narrow, silent streets that ended always in a high blank wall. It seemed {{impossible}} to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> blank wall. Whatever way she turned she was always coming back to it.|$|E
6000|$|She {{tried to}} think of {{something}} else, and to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> talk of a sail to Leyden, but she fatally answered, [...] "I saw your boat this afternoon. I had n't noticed before that it was still here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} could go to them, Kea," [...] I cried earnestly. [...] "Whatever they think and feel now, they couldn't help liking you and loving you when they saw you. I {{wish you could}} <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> dreadful Hawaii!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{see how it}} is, Pigeonswing; I see how it is, {{and thank}} you for this hint, while I honor your good faith to your own people. But I cannot go to Detroit, in the first place, for that town and fort have fallen {{into the hands of the}} British. It might be {{possible}} for a canoe to get past in the night, and to work its way through into Lake Erie, but I cannot quit my friends. If you can put us ALL in the way of <b>getting</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> spot, I shall be ready to enter into the scheme. Why can't we all get into the canoe, and go down stream, as soon as another night sets in? Before morning we could be twenty miles on our road." ...|$|R
5000|$|Supermen of Malegaon {{revolves}} around the passion which residents of Malegaon, a city in Maharashtra India, have for film making. The town is fraught with communal tensions, poverty and hardship. To <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> all <b>this,</b> residents of Malegaon take to making spoofs on Bollywood movies. This documentary is a journey through that movie making process.|$|R
60|$|I had {{to bring}} him, I suppose; there's no <b>getting</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> him in <b>this</b> life. But, as I have already observed, the happy ancients went to their Utopias without this sort of company.|$|R
