50|$|Due to an {{interplay of}} the forces of {{adhesion}} and surface tension, water exhibits capillary action whereby water rises into a narrow tube against the force of <b>gravity.</b> <b>Water</b> adheres to the inside wall of the tube and surface tension tends to straighten the surface causing a surface rise and more water is pulled up through cohesion. The process continues as the water flows up the tube until there is enough water such that gravity balances the adhesive force.|$|E
