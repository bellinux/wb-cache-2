5|$|Khalifa {{has also}} said that <b>her</b> parents have stopped {{speaking}} to <b>her</b> because of <b>her</b> career choice. In a statement, <b>her</b> parents disassociated themselves from <b>her</b> actions, saying that <b>her</b> decision to enter the porn industry was born of <b>her</b> residence {{in a foreign country}} which had a different culture than theirs, and that <b>her</b> actions did not reflect <b>her</b> upbringing. They {{also said that}} they hoped that she would leave pornography, saying that <b>her</b> image did not honor <b>her</b> family or <b>her</b> home country.|$|E
5|$|A pimp rapes Number 18 in a bar, then enslaves <b>her</b> sexually. Number 18's {{father died}} when she was young and <b>her</b> family {{struggled}} to support <b>her</b> thereafter. Strangers took <b>her</b> from <b>her</b> home in Cambodia as a child, replaced <b>her</b> name with a number, and prostituted <b>her</b> in various countries. Number 18 ends up in the Thai child prostitution industry. Most of <b>her</b> clients are rich men, many of them foreign tourists. In a brothel and bar called The Pearl, Number 18 is kept in a dark room containing only a table and a dilapidated bed. Whenever she fails to follow the orders of Mama, the brothel-keeper, Mama shouts at <b>her</b> and beats <b>her.</b> Number 18 prays for a man to come and save <b>her</b> from these ordeals. At the same time she becomes the most elegant and highly sought-after prostitute at The Pearl and <b>her</b> pimp's favourite. She becomes very proficient in pleasing men sexually but also remains childlike—she dries <b>her</b> face with <b>her</b> skirt and plays with its hem.|$|E
5|$|A {{week before}} <b>her</b> death, Mary went through <b>her</b> papers, weeding out some which were burnt, but <b>her</b> journal survives, as do <b>her</b> letters to William and to Frances Apsley. The Jacobites lambasted <b>her,</b> but the {{assessment}} of <b>her</b> character that came down to posterity was largely the vision of Mary as a dutiful, submissive wife, who assumed power reluctantly, exercised it with considerable ability when necessary, and willingly deferred it to <b>her</b> husband.|$|E

5|$|After <b>her</b> parents' {{separation}} in 1976, Jolie and <b>her</b> brother {{lived with}} their mother, who had abandoned <b>her</b> acting ambitions to focus on raising <b>her</b> children. <b>Her</b> mother raised <b>her</b> Catholic, but did not require <b>her</b> to go to church. As a child, she often watched films with <b>her</b> mother and it was this, rather than <b>her</b> father's successful career, that inspired <b>her</b> interest in acting, though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982). When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and <b>her</b> live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York; they returned to Los Angeles five years later. Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained {{for two years and}} appeared in several stage productions.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Ono's {{family moved}} without <b>her</b> to Scarsdale, New York, an {{affluent}} town 25 {{miles north of}} mid-town Manhattan. When she later rejoined <b>her</b> family in the U.S., she enrolled at nearby Sarah Lawrence College. While <b>her</b> parents approved of <b>her</b> college choice, Ono said that they disapproved of <b>her</b> lifestyle and chastised <b>her</b> for befriending people they felt were beneath <b>her.</b> In spite of <b>her</b> parents' disapproval, Ono loved meeting artists, poets, and others who represented the bohemian lifestyle to which she aspired. She visited galleries and art happenings in the city; this whetted <b>her</b> desire to publicly display <b>her</b> own artistic endeavors. American avant-garde artist, composer, and musician La Monte Young was <b>her</b> first important contact in the New York art world; he helped Ono start <b>her</b> career by using <b>her</b> Chambers Street loft in Tribeca as a performance space. After Ono set a painting on fire at one performance, <b>her</b> mentor John Cage advised <b>her</b> to treat the paper with flame retardant.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Douglas {{was very}} close with <b>her</b> mother after <b>her</b> parents' separation.

5|$|As a spouse, surgeon, and mother, Meredith has cited {{a number}} times {{that she did}} not want to be like either of <b>her</b> parents: <b>her</b> father had {{followed}} <b>her</b> mother around pathetically before leaving to be happy, while <b>her</b> mother valued <b>her</b> career over <b>her</b> family. Meredith is frequently conflicted trying to balance between the two, and fears <b>her</b> family are hindering <b>her</b> medical aspirations, as much as she fears becoming like <b>her</b> mother whenever she's tempted to choose surgery over family. Meredith and Cristina have a huge rift when Cristina confirms Meredith's fears by stating that Meredith's skills have fallen behind Cristina's due to <b>her</b> familial obligations taking <b>her</b> away from OR time.|$|E

5|$|Assigned male at birth, she {{was given}} the name Joshua Alcorn and raised in Ohio by a family {{affiliated}} with the Churches of Christ movement. At age 14, she came out as transgender to <b>her</b> parents, Carla and Doug Alcorn, who refused to accept <b>her</b> female gender identity. When she was 16, they denied <b>her</b> request to undergo transition treatment, instead sending <b>her</b> to Christian-based conversion therapy {{with the intention of}} convincing <b>her</b> to reject <b>her</b> gender identity and accept <b>her</b> gender as assigned at birth. After she revealed <b>her</b> attraction toward males to <b>her</b> classmates, <b>her</b> parents removed <b>her</b> from school and revoked <b>her</b> access to social media. In <b>her</b> suicide note, Alcorn cited loneliness and alienation as key reasons for <b>her</b> decision to end <b>her</b> life and blamed <b>her</b> parents for causing these feelings.

5|$|At 16, {{the aging}} Lad befriends Sonya, a seven-year-old girl whose father {{works at the}} Place. <b>Her</b> father forces <b>her</b> to assist him with his work, then brutally mistreats <b>her</b> if she is slow.

The next day, while the Master and Mistress are at a show and the other workers are off on holiday, Sonya's father starts to beat <b>her</b> for accidentally dropping a heavy basket. Lad comes to <b>her</b> rescue and they retreat to the veranda where she pets him while he sleeps. When Sonya goes to the barn, <b>her</b> father is waiting for <b>her</b> and closes the door. Somehow she senses Lad beside <b>her,</b> which gives <b>her</b> the courage {{to stand up to}} <b>her</b> father. The man imagines he sees Lad beside <b>her</b> and runs away in fear. Unknown to both, Lad had died in his sleep and the Master and Mistress were crying over his body on the veranda.|$|E
5|$|At Velfarre, she was {{introduced}} to <b>her</b> future producer, Max Matsuura, through a friend. After hearing Hamasaki sing karaoke, Matsuura offered <b>her</b> a recording deal, but Hamasaki suspected ulterior motives and turned the offer down.

When she confessed this to Matsuura, he sent <b>her</b> to New York to train <b>her</b> vocals under another method. During <b>her</b> foreign sojourn, Hamasaki frequently corresponded with Matsuura and impressed him with <b>her</b> style of writing. On <b>her</b> return to Japan, he suggested that she try writing <b>her</b> own lyrics.|$|E
