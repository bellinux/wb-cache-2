40|$|Appeal Boards {{serve as}} one {{mechanism}} for promoting administrative or social justice in public assistance. The Canada Assistance Plan (1966) required {{each of the}} provinces to establish welfare review tribunals and consequently each of the provinces and territories have Welfare Appeal Systems. The Canada Assistance Plan is the Federal Act that enables a province to receive reimbursement for one-half its annual expenditure on social welfare by entering into {{an agreement with the}} federal government. [...] This study was undertaken to specifically examine the Appeal process from the following perspectives: (1) the characteristics of the original decisions made by the social service employee that prompted the appeal; (2) the characteristics of the clients that decided to appeal; (3) the characteristics of the appeals and (4) the outcome of the appeals. [...] The review of the literature revealed that appeal systems have developed {{as an integral part of}} income-maintenance programs as a means to ensure that individuals receive their appropriate entitlement. The criticism of local agency practices reached its peak in 1970 with the United States Supreme Court's decision in Goldberg vs. Kelly, that AFDC recipients must be provided an opportunity to evidentiary hearings before termination of their benefits (O'Neil, cited in Hammer & Hartley, 1978). The relationship of legal representation on the outcome of appeals has been examined and while the findings indicate the need for Social Workers to be informed about the appeal procedures, it also found that petitioners without legal counsel were able to use the procedural safeguard of evidence presentation (Hagan, 1983). However, in order to utilize appeal opportunities more effectively, citizens must know that they exist and know the laws and regulations that constrain administrative practice. The need for expertise in pursuing grievances was also evident. [...] This descriptive study involves an <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeals</b> for the entire province of Newfoundland and Labrador for the period April 1, 1983, to March 31, 1986. A total of 293 appeals were examined. Case files for each of the 293 cases were examined and the relevant data was coded and transferred to a master list for review and analysis. Interviews were also conducted with the three members who comprise the Appeal Board. [...] The findings revealed that the Appeal Board and employees have considerable discretion within the Social Assistance Act and Regulations and even within policy in making its decisions. The use of advocates to assist with the Appeal did not seem to have a significant overall difference on the outcome of the Appeal, however, the use of family relatives and legal aid lawyers did seem to positively impact upon the outcome of the hearing. [...] According to the members of the Appeal Board, there are a number of barriers to the appeal process for Social Assistance recipients. They include not being aware of the appeal process; inability to attend hearings in central locations due to the distance from the hearings; clients not having the money to enable them to attend the hearings and the perception on the part of some clients that the Appeal Board is not independent...|$|E

40|$|In three recent decisions, Hudson v. Michigan, Herring v. United States, {{and last}} Term 2 ̆ 7 s Davis v. United States, the Supreme Court has {{indicated}} {{a desire to}} severely restrict the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule. A majority of the Justices wants to limit its application to cases where the police have violated the Fourth Amendment purposely, knowingly, or recklessly, but not where they have engaged in 2 ̆ 2 simple, isolated negligence 2 ̆ 2 or where negligence is 2 ̆ 2 attenuated 2 ̆ 2 from {{the discovery of the}} evidence. They have further suggested that evidence should not be excluded where the police have behaved as reasonable policemen, using the approach from United States v. Leon. The Court 2 ̆ 7 s new approach, based on the culpability of the police, is subjective, yet the Court insists that it does not probe the police 2 ̆ 7 s mind. The new approach seems to reject negligence as the basis of exclusion, yet Leon is a negligence-based approach. The new approach assumes that 2 ̆ 2 reckless 2 ̆ 2 behavior can be deterred more readily than negligent behavior, but that is not obvious. This Article reviews Hudson, Herring, and Davis, as well as the court <b>of</b> <b>appeals</b> cases that have applied Herring. It suggests that the Supreme Court has not eliminated the exclusionary rule and argues that the rule should still be applied in cases of 2 ̆ 2 substantial 2 ̆ 2 as opposed to 2 ̆ 2 simple isolated 2 ̆ 2 negligence-that is, when negligence has substantially interfered with a suspect 2 ̆ 7 s privacy rights, such as through an illegal arrest or an illegal search of his car or house. It notes that none of the three cases decided by the Court involved such a substantial intrusion. It concludes, through a careful reading of the three cases, as well as <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> successful defense <b>appeals</b> in the courts <b>of</b> <b>appeals,</b> that the exclusionary rule, though limited, is neither dead nor unacceptably constrained...|$|R

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} fill a major gap in modern First Amendment {{scholarship}} by providing a comprehensive <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> {{a new form of}} doctrinal analysis that has emerged {{over the past two decades}} in free speech law: the “intermediate scrutiny” test. This is the first major scholarly <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> this area of law in over twenty years, and identifies a number of important and problematic developments that have occurred during that time. The article proceeds in three phases. First, I provide a historical description of the emergence of the new “intermediate scrutiny” test since the mid- 1980 s, through a careful <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> the caselaw in both the Supreme Court and in the Courts <b>of</b> <b>Appeals.</b> My essential argument here is that so-called “intermediate scrutiny” arose through the almost inadvertent, and to this date still somewhat incomplete, merger of a number of previously distinct strands of First Amendment jurisprudence in the Supreme Court. Despite the uncertainties that still exist in the Supreme Court, however, at the appellate level it is clear that a distinct body of “intermediate scrutiny” free speech jurisprudence has in fact emerged, and that the Courts <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> now generally recognize “intermediate scrutiny” as a well-established First Amendment test. Second, I turn to an examination, including some empirical analysis, of how the intermediate scrutiny test has in fact been applied in the Courts <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> since its emergence twenty years ago. In this section I provide numerical analyses of the 111 relevant appellate cases, as well as descriptions of some of the most significant ones. Finally, in the third part of the article I articulate some lessons that emerge from the analysis provided in the second part, and provide recommendations for the future. In particular, I argue that the emergence of the 2 ̆ 2 intermediate scrutiny 2 ̆ 2 test has severely limited the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s ability to control the consistency or quality of lower court decisionmaking in this area, and has in aggregate had a substantial, negative impact on freedom of speech. For that reason, the Court should seriously consider disaggregating the various strands of intermediate scrutiny jurisprudence...|$|R
