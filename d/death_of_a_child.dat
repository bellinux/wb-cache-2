5|$|In North India, Shashthi is worshipped at {{childbirth}} and puberty, {{and during}} marriage rites. When the pregnant woman is isolated during childbirth in the lying-in chamber, a cow-dung {{figure of the}} goddess is traditionally kept in the room. The birth of a living child is considered the blessing of Shashthi, while {{the birth of a}} stillborn infant or the early <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> are considered manifestations of her wrath. Before childbirth, Shashthi is worshipped to protect the welfare of the expecting mother. She is also invoked after childbirth on the sixth day of each month until the child reaches puberty, especially when the child is sick.|$|E

5|$|The only area {{in which}} Keela and Eddie gave alerts was {{apartment}} 5A. Both dogs alerted behind the sofa in the living room, and on and under the veranda in the bedroom Madeleine's parents had used. The Polícia Judiciária obtained search warrants to search the house the McCanns had rented on Rua das Flores, and the silver Renault Scénic the couple had hired 24 days after Madeleine went missing. The house and grounds were searched on 2 August. The only alert was from Eddie when he encountered Cuddle Cat, which was lying in the living room; Keela did not give an alert. The police left with boxes of the McCanns' clothes, Cuddle Cat, a pair of latex gloves, suitcases, a notepad, two diaries, including one that Kate had started after the disappearance, and a friend's Bible she had borrowed. A passage the Bible's owner had marked from 2 Samuel, about the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> was copied into the police case file along with a Portuguese translation. The items were taken to another location, where Eddie alerted {{to one of the}} boxes of clothes.|$|E
25|$|Social {{networking}} {{can also}} be a risk to child safety in another way; parents can get addicted to games and neglect their children. One instance in South Korea resulted in the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> from starvation. Law enforcement agencies have published articles with their recommendations to parents about their children's use of social networking sites.|$|E
25|$|Rotavirus A, which {{accounts}} for more than 90% of rotavirus gastroenteritis in humans, is endemic worldwide.

25|$|Sudden {{infant death}} {{syndrome}} (SIDS), also known as cot death or crib death, is the sudden unexplained <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> {{less than one year}} of age. Diagnosis requires that the death remains unexplained even after a thorough autopsy and detailed death scene investigation. SIDS usually occurs during sleep. Typically death occurs between the hours of 00:00 and 09:00. There is usually no evidence of struggle and no noise produced.|$|E

25|$|Bereavement, while {{a normal}} part of life, carries a degree of risk when severe. Severe {{reactions}} affect approximately 10% to 15% of people. Severe reactions mainly occur in people with depression present before the loss event. Severe grief reactions may carry over into family relations. Some researchers have found an increased risk of marital breakup following the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> for example. Others have found no increase. John James, author of the Grief Recovery Handbook and founder of the Grief Recovery Institute, reported that his marriage broke up {{after the death of his}} infant son.|$|E
25|$|<b>Death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> {{can take}} the form of a loss in infancy such as {{miscarriage}} or stillbirth or neonatal death, SIDS, or the death of an older child. In most cases, parents find the grief almost unbearably devastating, and it tends to hold greater risk factors than any other loss. This loss also bears a lifelong process: one does not get 'over' the death but instead must assimilate and live with it. Intervention and comforting support can make all the difference to the survival of a parent in this type of grief but the risk factors are great and may include family breakup or suicide.|$|E
25|$|There is one {{additional}} theory {{that explains the}} occurrence of the reminiscence bump: the life script account. A life script refers to the series of culturally important transitional events {{that are expected to}} occur in a certain order at various points during the life span. During early adulthood one starts to make important decisions and have influencing experiences on his or her identity. The memories during this time period are therefore more significantly remembered because they are what has essentially determined and influenced their life script (Habernas & Bluck, 2000). A life script typically has the majority of expected transitional experiences occur during early adulthood (Gluck & Bluck, 2007), and usually include includes positive experiences such as marriage, the birth of a baby, or buying a house. Events that deviate from the life script are typically sad and traumatic. These events, such as the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> are not culturally expected and often do not show a peak of recall at any specific point during the life span. Life scripts act as a way to structure memory and lead to the expectation that the happiest and the most important life events form the reminiscence bump. Contrary to the recall of happy events, the recall of sad events remains stable across the life span and does not exhibit a bump in recall.|$|E

500|$|A restless youth, Breckinridge was {{suspended}} from Princeton University for fighting, and following his graduation from Union College in 1819, {{was prone to}} engage in a lifestyle of partying and revelry.

A serious illness and the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> in 1829 prompted him to turn to religion, and he became an ordained minister in 1832.|$|E
500|$|Although {{hinted at}} {{indirectly}} in some poems, Riley wrote very little on serious subject matter, and actually mocked attempts at serious poetry. Only {{a few of}} his sentimental poems concerned serious subjects. [...] "Little Mandy's Christmas-Tree", [...] "The Absence of Little Wesley", and [...] "The Happy Little Cripple" [...] were about poverty, the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> and disabilities. Like his children's poems, they too contained morals, suggesting society should pity the downtrodden and be charitable.|$|E

She weaves her life story among the other tales, describing her three marriages, [...] "motherhood and the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> each turning point marked by a particular item of clothing". Her life is represented beginning with experiences in a Brownies uniform and extending through her full life. Another character serves as the vixen, another plays a vulnerable gang member from Chicago, a third portrays a brave cancer patient, and the last serves as a mature woman pierced by vivid memories.

500|$|A foetus, {{even at a}} late {{stage of}} pregnancy, is not {{protected}} by the law of homicide (rather, other offences have been created to prevent the proscribed harm). To qualify, the victim must have an [...] "independent existence". This was confirmed in 1998 in Attorney General's Reference (No. 3 of 1994), even where the foetus is viable and could have survived if born before the offence was committed. The confused rationale appears to match the complicated moral and biological distinction on which it is based; there is huge social significance placed upon birth and thus the law is unlikely to change [...] Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights {{has not yet been}} interpreted to conflict with the English law. Instead, in Vo v France, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that most definitions were within the margin of appreciation set aside to national law. The <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> after birth from injuries sustained before birth would only constitute murder if the requisite intent [...] that the child would die after birth [...] was present. Other forms of homicide would also be applicable.|$|E
500|$|A {{major theme}} in Traveling Shoes, one that many critics overlook, is Angelou's {{love for her}} son. [...] The theme of {{motherhood}} is one of Angelou's most consistent themes throughout her series of autobiographies, although it does not overwhelm this book {{as it does in}} Gather Together in My Name and Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas. [...] Motherhood is present in many of the book's subthemes—her relationship with her houseboy Kojo, her delight in being called [...] "Auntie" [...] by many African children, and her feelings toward [...] "Mother Africa". [...] Traveling Shoes begins with Guy's accident, his long recovery, and his mother's reaction to it, thus universalizing the fear of every parent—the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> [...] The main character is a mother of a grown son, so liberation from the daily responsibilities of motherhood is emphasized, but it is complicated by the recognition that part of motherhood is letting go, something Angelou struggles with. [...] Confrontations between Angelou and Guy are minimal, consisting of their conflict over his choice of dating a much-older woman and of his demands for autonomy after she returns from the Genet tour. [...] Angelou seems to vacillate between wanting to supervise him and wanting to let go throughout this book. [...] In this way, as Lupton says, the motherhood theme, like the identity theme, is [...] "dual in nature".|$|E
