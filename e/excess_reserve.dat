Monetary survey data for the period 1 st June 2011 – 13 th September 2013 (i. e. inflation targeting lite period) is used. Results show no correlation between <b>excess</b> <b>reserves</b> and interbank rate movements, even though a Granger causality test shows that in the absence of money market intervention, the level of <b>excess</b> <b>reserves</b> may determine both the level of and changes in the interbank rate. There is also highly significant causality from Central Bank intervention to the target interbank rate, but no correlation between the two. Furthermore, {{there is no evidence of}} correlation or causation between <b>excess</b> <b>reserves</b> and interbank rates when the interbank rate falls outside of the target.

50|$|The Working Monetary Base {{is defined}} as the Monetary Base minus the <b>excess</b> <b>reserves</b> and should be conceptually {{understood}} as the fact that (at least as this instant in time) the <b>excess</b> <b>reserves</b> are not doing anything sort of like deep frozen money and that the working monetary base is only in use. Before the 2008 financial crisis, since <b>excess</b> <b>reserves</b> were small or unimportant; the working monetary base was essentially equivalent to the monetary base. Much recent economic work seems to indicate that the inflationary impact of the working monetary base is normal while the <b>excess</b> <b>reserves</b> have little current inflationary impact as general fears of hyper inflation have plagued economic columns since the balance sheet explosion. See the chart in this article showing that the actual working monetary base has appreciated much more normally than the traditional monetary base since 2008. <b>Excess</b> <b>reserves,</b> instead of being wasted, may contribute to the overall stability of the banking system since they are a more than legally required buffer against losses sudden and unexpected.|$|R

40|$|This article {{assesses the}} extent to which government-administered {{financial}} shocks and lower interest rates can account for the massive accumulation of bank <b>excess</b> <b>reserves</b> in the Great Depression. Both factors are shown to be statistically significant. Financial shocks did exert astatistically detectable influence on the demand for <b>excess</b> <b>reserves</b> but those shocks at best can account for a step-like increase in the level of reserves held, an increase which was completed in less than a year. Financial shocks can explain no more than 1 percent of the variation in <b>excess</b> <b>reserves</b> during the Great Depression. We demonstrate that the most statistically appropriate form of the demand function is one which flattened rapidly as interest rates fell. The fall in interest rates can account for 80 percent of the movement of <b>excess</b> <b>reserves</b> during the Great Depression. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the financial and}} real effects of <b>excess</b> <b>reserves</b> in a New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model with monopoly banking, credit market imperfections and a cost channel. The model explicitly accounts {{for the fact that}} banks hold <b>excess</b> <b>reserves</b> and they incur costs in holding these assets. Simulations of a shock to required reserves show that although raising reserve require- ments is successful in sterilizing <b>excess</b> <b>reserves,</b> it creates a procyclical e¤ect for real economic activity. This result implies that financial stability may come at a cost of macroeconomic stability. The findings also indicate that using an augmented Taylor rule in which the policy interest rate is adjusted in response to changes in excess re- serves reduces volatility in output and inflation but increases fluctuations in financial variables. To the contrary, using a countercyclical reserve requirement rule helps to mitigate fluctuations in <b>excess</b> <b>reserves,</b> but increases volatility in real variables. ...|$|R

40|$|High {{levels of}} <b>excess</b> <b>reserves</b> {{have been a}} {{persistent}} feature of Jamaica’s commercial banking system within the past two decades. These reserves provide a positive impact {{in terms of the}} institutions’ ability to respond to liquidity shocks. Notwithstanding this, questions have been raised {{as to whether or not}} such high levels of <b>excess</b> <b>reserves</b> present challenges to the Central Bank in its pursuit of price stability. For example, banks have been able to easily find the wherewithal to extend credit, even when the Central Bank adopts an extremely tight monetary policy stance. In this context, this paper examines the trends in <b>excess</b> <b>reserves</b> of commercial banks in Jamaica during the period 1998 to 2010 and the challenges encountered by the Central Bank in the implementation of monetary policy. The paper estimates the demand for <b>excess</b> <b>reserves</b> using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test approach developed by Pesaran et al. (2001). The empirical results show that the major determinants of the <b>excess</b> <b>reserves</b> of commercial banks in Jamaica in the long-run and short-run are the reserve requirements, fluctuations in the currency-to-deposit ratio, the deviation of income from trend, the volatility of income, the deficit of the Central Government and the interest rate offered on the BOJ’s 180 -day security. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract <b>Excess</b> <b>reserves,</b> the {{indication}} of a bank’s opportunity to invest, have historically been quite predictable and low for many years. From early sixties to August of 2008, the percentage of <b>excess</b> <b>reserves</b> in relation to required reserves has been between 1 % to 9 %. In September 2008, shortly prior to the tipping point of the 2008 financial crisis, the level of <b>excess</b> <b>reserves</b> began to rise dramatically and has stayed quite high even four years later. The watershed moment of Lehman Brothers and AIG failing precipitated a banking panic that involved drastic policy changes by the Fed and financial firms scrambling to find liquidity {{in anticipation of a}} credit crunch and drawdowns of credit lines. In less than six months, <b>excess</b> <b>reserves</b> ballooned to over $ 900 billion, which accounts to 2, 063 % of required reserves. Surprisingly, the large amount of <b>excess</b> <b>reserves</b> did not return to the previous levels. Instead, it has increased even more to nearly $ 2 trillion. This paper thus investigates the determinants for banks to hoard liquidity. The data reveals that high losses in loans and investments have caused banks to prognosticate higher levels of precautionary reserves. Furthermore, the very low federal funds rate and high unemployment rate have given banks limited opportunities to use the reserves in other alternative investment vehicles. Finally, the Federal Reserve’s decision to pay interest on <b>excess</b> <b>reserves</b> provided incentives for banks and made holding reserves above the required amount no longer a cost for the bank...|$|R
