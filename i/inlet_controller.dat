40|$|A brief {{description}} of the NASA F- 15 research aircraft propulsion system is given. The F- 15 is powered by two PW 1128 afterburning turbofan engines which are growth versions of the F 100 -PW- 100 engine. The PW 1128 is controlled by a full-authority digital electronic engine control (DEEC). The F- 15 inlet is a two-dimensional, three-ramp, external compression design with partially cut back side plates. Each inlet is independently controlled by an electronic air <b>inlet</b> <b>controller</b> (EAIC) ...|$|E
40|$|The Highly Integrated Digital Electronic Control (HIDEC) {{development}} program conducted at NASA-Ames/Dryden will use an F- 15 test aircraft for flight demonstration. An account is presently given of the HIDEC Inlet Integration mode's design concept, control law, and test aircraft implementation, {{with a view}} to its performance benefits. The enhancement of performance {{is a function of the}} use of Digital Electronic Engine Control corrected engine airflow computations to improve the scheduling of inlet ramp positions in real time; excess thrust can thereby be increased by 13 percent at Mach 2. 3 and 40, 000 ft. Aircraft supportability is also improved through the obviation of <b>inlet</b> <b>controllers...</b>|$|R
40|$|This work {{concerns}} {{the implementation of}} a new control system for hybrids with solid oxide fuel cell and micro gas turbines. It is based on a complete hybrid system emulator test rig developed at the University of Genoa (Savona laboratory) by the Thermochemical Power Group (TPG). The plant is mainly composed of a 100 kW recuperated micro gas turbine coupled with both anodic and cathode vessels for high temperature fuel cell emulation and a complete real time model which purpose is to simulate the fuel cell and its electrochemical behavior. The model and the connected physical plant represent a full hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) facility. Temperature, pressure and air mass flow rate at the recuperator outlet (downstream of the compressor) and rotational speed of the machine are inputs from the plant to the model. The turbine outlet temperature (TOT) calculated by the model is fed into the machine control system and the turbine electric load is moved to match the model TOT values. A new revised stack <b>inlet</b> temperature <b>controller</b> has been extensively tested and showed to be very stable and robust. It is capable to contain temperature deviation against a fixed set point within a band of 3 °C when a fuel cell load ramp occurs. The controller is a standard PID (proportional-integral-derivative) plus a feed forward contribution. The PID is protected against wind up...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The maximum {{performance}} of a supersonic inlet will be achieved when operating {{as close as possible}} to its buzz boundary. In order to maintain high performance without crossing the buzz boundary, an active buzz margin predictor and controller is necessary. The goal of a control system is to acquire inlet buzzmargin andmaintain it as the designated value and predict inlet buzz before it occurs and then take some measures to buzz mitigation or inlet restart. The inlet buzz boundary and themargin of ducted rocketswere first discussed and analysed. Then the dynamic mathematical model of a gas flow control system was established. Lastly, the <b>inlet</b> buzz margin <b>controller</b> of a ducted rocket was designed. Simulation results show that there exist anti-regulation characteristics for gas flow control for ducted rockets, and it leads to the particularity of inlet buzz margin control for ducted rockets in contrast to liquid ramjet. The designed inlet buzz margin has to be bigger to avoid the appearing of inlet buzz because of anti-regulation characteristics; otherwise, the inlet buzz phenomenon probably appears. If the inlet buzz of the ducted rocket appears, the command of decreasing fuel flow could not be given immediately; otherwise, the inlet buzz will aggravate...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Biological and Agricultural EngineeringWenqiao YuanGasification is an {{efficient}} way to produce energy from biomass, which has significant positive impacts on the environment, domestic economy, national energy security, and the society in general. In this study, a lab-scale updraft biomass gasifier was designed, built, and instrumented for stable gasification using low-bulk density biomass. Related accessories, such as a biomass feeder, <b>inlet</b> air temperature <b>controller,</b> air injection nozzle, and tar cracking system, were also developed to enhance gasifier performance. The effect of operation parameters on gasifier performance was studied. Two operational parameters, including air flow rate and feed-air temperature, were studied on three sources of biomass: prairie hay, sorghum biomass, and wood chips. Results showed that higher air flow rate increased tar contents in syngas for all three types. It was also found that different biomasses gave significantly different tar contents, in the order of wood chips>sorghum biomass>prairie hay. Feed-air temperature did not {{have a significant effect on}} tar content in syngas except for prairie hay, where higher feed air temperature reduced tar. A statistical model was implemented to study differences on syngas composition. Results showed that different biomasses produced syngas with different high heating value, e. g., wood chips > prairie hay > sorghum biomass. CO composition also showed differences by feed air temperature and biomass, e. g. prairie hay>wood chips>sorghum biomass, but H[subscript] 2 did not show significant differences by either biomass type or operating conditions. Moreover, because of the downstream problems caused by tars in syngas such as tar condensation in pipelines, blockage and machinery collapse, an in-situ tar cracking system was developed to remove tars in syngas. The tar cracking device was built in the middle of the gasifier’s combustion using gasification heat to drive the reactions. The in-situ system was found to be very effective in tar removal and syngas enhancement. The highest tar removal of 95 % was achieved at 0. 3 s residence time and 10 % nickel loading. This condition also gave the highest syngas HHV increment of 36 % (7. 33 MJ/m[superscript] 3). The effect of gas residence time and Ni loading on tar removal and syngas composition was also studied. Gas residence of 0. 2 - 0. 3 s and Ni loading of 10 % were found appropriate in this study...|$|R
