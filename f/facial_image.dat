25|$|The {{additional}} obligations imposed by European law on national border authorities {{when it comes}} to processing travellers who are third-country nationals (e.g. the obligation to stamp their travel documents) should not prevent the development of automated border control systems which are made available to such travellers. As shown by the examples listed above of automated border control systems which have been developed at external border crossing points of the Schengen Area, national border authorities have been able to adapt the design of their automated border control systems to allow third-country nationals to make use of them. One solution is to have a border guard physically positioned next to the automated border gates who can stamp travel documents where required: this approach has been adopted by the Finnish Border Guard at the automated border gates in Helsinki Airport, where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include holders of Australian, Canadian, Japanese, New Zealand, South Korean and United States biometric passports, {{as well as by the}} Portuguese Servi√ßo de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras at the automated border gates in Lisbon Airport where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include holders of Angolan and Brazilian passports and holders of diplomatic/service passports. A similar but slightly different solution has been adopted by the Dutch Royal Marechaussee at the Privium iris recognition automated border gates at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport (where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens, US citizens who are Global Entry members, and all nationals who are holders of diplomatic passports), as well as by the German Federal Police at the ABG Plus iris recognition automated border gates at Frankfurt Airport (where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and US citizens who are Global Entry members): when eligible third-country nationals use Privium/ABG Plus, after their iris is scanned and verified, a different gate opens to that for EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and the third-country national is directed to a lane which leads them to the front of the queue for manual passport checks at immigration desks, where the border officer stamps the user's passport. Another possible solution would be to design the automated border gates to print a paper slip with an entry or exit stamp on it, as well as the traveller's name and travel document number, whenever the user is a traveller who is subject to the requirement to have his or her travel document stamped. At the Port of Helsinki, the Finnish Border Guard has adapted the design of the automated border gates there to widen eligibility to include Russian citizens (who, as Annex I nationals, are required to have a visa) by requiring them to scan both the biodata page and the visa inside their passport, then to step into the gate for a <b>facial</b> <b>image</b> and fingerprint recognition, and after the gate opens to approach a border officer to have their passport stamped.|$|E

Instead, they can go through an e-gate by scanning their e-passport and finger(s) all by themselves with the whole process taking only 10 seconds at most. Entry information and their <b>facial</b> <b>image</b> will be stored automatically in a database. (No entry stamps will be left in their e-passport, but any passport holder could request gratis entry or exit records.) E-gates are not only used for fast entry for Chinese e-passport holders, but they have also [...] been tested for fast-exit in Beijing Capital Airport Terminal 2. In the future, Chinese e-passport holders can both exit and enter China by e-gate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Emotion {{recognition}} from <b>facial</b> <b>images</b> {{is a very}} active research topic in human computer interaction (HCI). However, most of the previous approaches only focus on the frontal or nearly frontal view <b>facial</b> <b>images.</b> In contrast to the frontal/nearly-frontal view images, emotion {{recognition from}} non-frontal view or even arbitrary view <b>facial</b> <b>images</b> {{is much more difficult}} yet of more practical utility. To handle the emotion recognition problem from arbitrary view <b>facial</b> <b>images,</b> in this paper we propose a novel method based on the regional covariance matrix (RCM) representation of <b>facial</b> <b>images.</b> We also develop a new discriminant analysis theory, aiming at reducing the dimensionality of the facial feature vectors while preserving the most discriminative information, by minimizing an estimated multiclass Bayes error derived under the Gaussian mixture model (GMM). We further propose an efficient algorithm to solve the optimal discriminant vectors of the proposed discriminant analysis method. We render thousands of multi-view 2 D <b>facial</b> <b>images</b> from the BU- 3 DFE database and conduct extensive experiments on the generated database to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. It is worth noting that our method does not require face alignment or facial landmark points localization, making it very attractive. ...|$|R

30|$|SHR is {{developed}} for low-resolution images. Because {{there are no}} large low-resolution face databases, we used the FRGCv 2 database and created low-resolution <b>facial</b> <b>images</b> by low-pass filtering and subsequent downsampling.

40|$|Abstract: The authors {{describe}} their experiences creating technology to automatically capture <b>facial</b> <b>images</b> from patients during triage and registration for {{integration into the}} electronic medical record (EMR) to reduce data retrieval and data entry errors. The prototype system was tested {{across a variety of}} ethnicities with <b>facial</b> <b>images</b> captured successfully in 100 % of cases with a median time to capture of 0. 75 seconds. Objective: Despite the use of electronic medical record (EMR) technology and computerized physician order entry (CPOE) systems, medical error remains pervasive. In particular, patient-identity errors are particularly persistent (i. e. technically accurate orders written for the wrong patient). Patient identity errors can account for as many as 35 % of all medical errors [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Augmenting existing EMR textual identifiers with patient <b>facial</b> <b>images</b> may decrease patient identification errors. <b>Facial</b> <b>images</b> could be captured through manual, volitional processes- however, automated methods have several potential advantages including: faster throughput during triage or registration, consistency of image resolution and capture quality, and enhanced compliance by triage personnel.

When estimating <b>facial</b> <b>images</b> of different nationalities, the variance generally tended to be larger, although the average was similar. This study suggests that the underestimation of age occurs despite differences in Japanese and American societies and cultures; however, the tendency of underestimation of age is not related to <b>facial</b> <b>images</b> but to social and cultural factors that influence the participants...|$|R
