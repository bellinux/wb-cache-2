40|$|Previous {{research}} has documented the prevalent effects of message order on message persuasiveness. Based on the Belief Updating Model (Hogarth and Einhorn, 1992), response mode {{has been found}} as one moderator of primacy versus recency effects. The present study considers additionally the role of culture as a moderator. Because internalized cultural values and norms affect how messages are processed and interpreted, we propose that cultural differences in cognitive processing styles will impact whether primacy or recency effects are stronger under different message order conditions in for Easterners and Westerners. Results from the current work offer evidence that both culture and cognitive style (holistic versus analytical thinking) serve as moderators to explain message order effects. Results replicate prior studies showing a primacy effect with <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sequence</b> response mode and a recency effect with Step-by-Step response mode. Further, we found that Easterners were more influenced by the primacy effect when compared to Westerners. However, the effect of primacy was attenuated by response mode.

40|$|In {{this study}} the authors {{examined}} the sequences of the ribosomal 18 S rRNA of Drosophila and man and 16 mRNA sequences coding for different {{members of the}} family of the mammalian formyl peptide receptors (FPRs). The positions in the sequences of all >or= 7 -base oligonucleotide identities occurring in {{at least one of the}} 18 S rRNAs and one of the FPR mRNAs were recorded. On the basis of the positional data, the Drosophila 18 S-FPR and human 18 S-FPR distances (in nucleotides) were determined for each identity. Then the actual frequency distribution of the distances (grouped into 200 -unit classes) was derived. The theoretical frequency distribution of distances was also calculated under the assumption of non-relatedness between the 18 S and FPR sequences. Comparison between the theoretical and the actual distributions showed that at class - 500 (range from - 400 to - 600) of the 18 S-FPR values the actual frequency was significantly (p < 0. 01) higher than the theoretical frequency, in both Drosophila and man, suggesting that the second section of the FPR genes (approximately from nucleotide 400 to the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>sequence)</b> may be structurally related to the first section of the ribosomal 18 S genes (approximately nucelotides 1 - 650).

40|$|Next-generation {{sequencing}} (NGS) is {{a powerful}} tool for analyzing environmental DNA and provides the comprehensive molecular view of microbial communities. For obtaining the copy number of particular sequences in the NGS library, however, additional quantitative analysis as quantitative PCR (qPCR) or digital PCR (dPCR) is required. Furthermore, number of sequences in a sequence library does not always reflect the original copy number of a target gene because of biases caused by PCR amplification, making it difficult to convert the proportion of particular sequences in the NGS library to the copy number using the mass of input DNA. To address this issue, we applied stochastic labeling approach with random-tag sequences and developed a NGS-based quantification protocol, which enables simultaneous sequencing and quantification of the targeted DNA. This quantitative sequencing (qSeq) is initiated from single-primer extension (SPE) using a primer with random tag adjacent to the 5 ' end of target-specific sequence. During SPE, each DNA molecule is stochastically labeled with the random tag. Subsequently, first-round PCR is conducted, specifically targeting the SPE product, followed by second-round PCR to index for NGS. The number of random tags is only determined during the SPE step and is therefore not affected by the two rounds of PCR that may introduce amplification biases. In the case of 16 S rRNA genes, after NGS sequencing and taxonomic classification, the absolute number of target phylotypes 16 S rRNA gene can be estimated by Poisson statistics by counting random tags incorporated at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>sequence.</b> To test the feasibility of this approach, the 16 S rRNA gene of Sulfolobus tokodaii was subjected to qSeq, which resulted in accurate quantification of 5. 0 × 103 to 5. 0 × 104 copies of the 16 S rRNA gene. Furthermore, qSeq was applied to mock microbial communities and environmental samples, and the results were comparable to those obtained using digital PCR and relative abundance based on a standard sequence library. We demonstrated that the qSeq protocol proposed here is advantageous for providing less-biased absolute copy numbers of each target DNA with NGS sequencing at one time. By this new experiment scheme in microbial ecology, microbial community compositions can be explored in more quantitative manner, thus expanding our knowledge of microbial ecosystems in natural environments...|$|E

40|$|The middle Eocene Tamet Formation on {{the eastern}} side of the Sirte Basin, is largely shallow-marine {{carbonate}} platform-to-basin transition formed along passive margin. The stratigraphy and deposition of this formation were largely controlled by eustatic processes of superimposed short-term and long-term of relative sea-level fluctuations. Tamet sediments were mostly deposited in subtidal environments, which ranged from above fairweather- to below storm wave-base. Intrinisic processes such as storm and wave redeposition and reworking may have acted to inhibit aggradation into the zone of peritidal sedimentation. Estimates of water depth during deposition range from a few metres to a few tens metres maximum. There are three major plat formal facies associations in the transition from deep subtidal to hypersaline deposits. These facies associations are defined and interpreted on the basis of their constituent microfacies and depend on their palaeogeographic setting on the platform. The spatial distribution of the complete spectrum of the facies associations suggest that deposition took place under low-energy conditions, as a stacked prograding homoclinal ramp. Ten microfacies types have been distinguished, and their vertical interrelationships reflect metre-scale, shallowing-upward subtidal cycles, which are considered as the basic building blocks of the Tamet ramp. Two different types of subtidal cycle have recognised in the study area. Open-marine subtidal cycles are present along the outer through inner ramp within the transgressive and most of the highstand deposits. They are characterised by relatively deep subtidal microfacies at the base, gradationally overlain by shallow subtidal microfacies. Hypersaline subtidal cycles are present only upon the Cyrenaica Platform and predominated during the late phase of highstand deposition; they are composed of dolomitised shallow subtidal microfacies, capped by anhydrite. The middle Eocene across this area is not a single carbonate ramp but rather an amalgamation of stacked ramps. Facies associations and cycles within the Tamet Formation have allowed the recognition of three depositional sequences separated by stratigraphic transitional zones. Each sequence represents a prograded ramp. The development of a sequence framework is based on the metre-scale cycle architecture and maintaining microfacies interpretations. Most of the sequences are interpreted as transgressive-highstand deposits. Each transgressive ramp is typically characterised by an aggradational patterns of relatively deep subtidal mud-rich carbonates deposited in a catch-up depositional system and episodically affected by storm events. Away from the ramp-margin, the transgressive facies change and stratigraphically thin into lagoonal facies deposited under keep-up conditions. The subsequent highstand ramp begins with an aggradational geometry but finally shifts into a distinct progradational pattern. The highstand cycles cover a broader area than that occupied by the transgressive sediments and are made up of mud-poor packstones reflecting a keep-up depositional system. The Cyrenaica Platform at this time was occupied by a very shallow and hypersaline sea. Carbonate sedimentation was shut off and replaced by precipitation of shallow-water evaporites; associated with this was dolomitisation, marking the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>sequence.</b> Several lines of evidence suggest that the magnitude of the middle Eocene sea-level fluctuations {{on the eastern}} Sirte Basin were relatively low. First, if the magnitude of the oscillations had been greater, then the sea-level falls would potentially have lead to formation of major sequence boundaries on the Tamet sequence upper surfaces. Second, if the magnitude was larger, then the rapid sea-level rises would have caused drowning of the ramp or domination by "catch-up" style of subtidal deposits. However, the Haq et al. (1987) sea-level chart in some circumstances may require modification, at least in terms of magnitudes and eustatic sea-level rises...|$|E
