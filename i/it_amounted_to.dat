However, at the medal ceremony he walked off the podium and dropped his medal on the mat in protest of the judging in his event.

5|$|By {{executive}} order, Bevin required {{all state}} agencies to reduce spending {{in their current}} budgets by 4.5 percent. House Speaker Greg Stumbo argued that Bevin {{did not have the}} authority to order such reductions without legislative approval, but Senate President Robert Stivers defended Bevin's action, saying <b>it</b> <b>amounted</b> <b>to</b> simply not spending money that was previously allocated. Bevin later compromised with the state's public college and university presidents to reduce the cuts to 2 percent, but Attorney General Andy Beshear sued to stop the cuts entirely. On May 18, 2016, a Franklin Circuit Court judge ruled Bevin did have the authority to make the cuts. The Kentucky Supreme Court accepted the case on appeal, granting Beshear's request to bypass the Kentucky Court of Appeals for expediency. A hearing before the Supreme Court occurred on August 18. On September 21, 2016, the Supreme Court issued a 5–2 decision reversing the Franklin Circuit Court ruling and agreeing with Beshear that Bevin did not have the authority to make mid-year budget cuts without the approval of the General Assembly.|$|E

25|$|In the Dutch fishery, a {{last was}} a {{measurement}} of the fish loaded into {{the various types of}} fishing boat in use (e.g. a bomschuit, buis, sloep or logger).

A cran (kantje) held about 900 to 1,000 herring. In Flanders a last was about 1,000kg of herring. The term fell out of use when the herring fishery disappeared.|$|E

25|$|The Court of Appeal {{decided the}} matter in Coughlan's favour.

In the circumstances, the Court was of the view that for the Authority to frustrate Coughlan's legitimate expectation was so unfair that <b>it</b> <b>amounted</b> <b>to</b> an abuse of power.

25|$|The {{decision}} {{to establish a}} republic in 1919, rather than {{any other form of}} government, was significant because <b>it</b> <b>amounted</b> <b>to</b> a complete repudiation of all constitutional ties with Great Britain, and set the party against any compromise that might involve initial self-government under the Home Rule Act 1914 or continued membership of the British Empire. One obstacle to this decision—that the Unionists of the north-east had long indicated that they would never participate in any form of a republic—was left unresolved, the six north-eastern counties remaining part of the United Kingdom under the Government of Ireland Act 1920, and later the Anglo-Irish Treaty.|$|E
25|$|The {{disease is}} spread {{primarily}} by {{two species of}} psyllid insects.

Generalist predators such as the ladybird beetles Curinus coeruleus, Olla v-nigrum, Harmonia axyridis, and Cycloneda sanguinea, and the lacewings Ceraeochrysa spp. and Chrysoperla spp. make significant contribution to the mortality of the Asian citrus psyllid, which results in 80–100% reduction in psyllid populations. In contrast, parasitism by Tamarixia radiata, a species-specific parasitoid of the Asian citrus psyllid, is variable and generally low in southwest Florida: in 2006, <b>it</b> <b>amounted</b> <b>to</b> a reduction of less than 12% from May to September and 50% in November.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} World War II, much of Europe was devastated. Sustained aerial {{bombardment}} {{during the}} war had badly damaged most major cities, and industrial facilities were especially hard-hit. The region's trade flows had been thoroughly disrupted; millions were in refugee camps living on aid from United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and other agencies. Food shortages were severe, especially in the harsh winter of 1946–47. From July 1945 through June 1946, the United States shipped 16.5 million tons of food, primarily wheat, to Europe and Japan. <b>It</b> <b>amounted</b> <b>to</b> one-sixth of the American food supply, and provided 35 trillion calories, enough to provide 400 calories a day for one year to 300 million people.|$|E

25|$|The {{reason for}} {{choosing}} Partridge for this role is unclear. Although he was, by then, {{one of the}} more eminent British surgeons, he never achieved the fame of his colleague, Sir William Fergusson. The Royal College of Surgeons' biography characterises him as 'a painstaking but not a brilliant surgeon; minute in detail and hesitating in execution'. More importantly, he had no experience with gunshot injuries. The contemporary medical press attacked the mission for its serious breach in medical etiquette in presuming to consult on a patient without having been invited to do so by the attending medical practitioners. <b>It</b> <b>amounted</b> <b>to</b> patient stealing, and was an affront to the dignity of the profession (newly self-regulating since the creation of the General Medical Council in 1858). The Lancet was also scathing about the 'new manifestation of the proverbial insular pride which is ever insisting upon the immense superiority of everything British'.|$|E
25|$|Gamergate {{supporters}} were {{critical of the}} wave of articles calling for diversity that followed the initial outbreak of the controversy; interpreting them as an attack on games and gamer culture.

Intel reacted to this by withdrawing an ad campaign from Gamasutra in October 2014.
