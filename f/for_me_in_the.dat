5|$|Before I {{had become}} {{familiar}} with my surroundings the President sent <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> interview that followed he told me what he wanted, and what the failures and his disappointments had been, and proceeded to advise me as to what I should do to accomplish the purpose determined upon {{in the way of}} the new coinage. In this talk he suggested some details of action of a drastic character for my guidance, which he was positive were necessary to be adopted before success could be had. All this was delivered in his usual vigorous way, emphasizing many points by hammering on the desk with his fist.|$|E
25|$|The {{day before}} {{yesterday}} I was present at an operation performed by Dr. George McClellan, on a gentleman from Virginia. It consisted in {{the removal of the}} whole of the parotid gland in a scirrhous and much enlarged state, from {{the left side of the}} face. Nothing could exceed the combined coolness and skill manifested by Dr. M. throughout this terrible operation, which he has now performed for the eleventh time, and hitherto with remarkable success. On this occasion, however, he was doomed to disappointment, for the patient died last night, about thirty-six hours after the operation. McClellan sent <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evening, to see the dying man with him, and we met in the chamber of death between ten and eleven o'clock. I had sometimes heard McClellan spoken of as a heartless surgeon, devoid of feeling or sympathy for those who came under his knife; but I can solemnly aver that I have seldom witnessed more unaffected sorrow than he manifested on this occasion. He walked the room incessantly, and repeatedly clasped my hands in his, while he expressed, in emphatic language, the feelings that preyed upon his mind. He moreover assured me, that he seldom performed one of his severer operations without first asking the blessing of God on his undertaking; and that days and nights of painful anxiety, often preceded those great professional efforts which have justly placed his name on the pinnacle of surgical fame. The gurgling respiration of the unfortunate patient announced the near approach of death, and I withdrew, full of sympathy for the agonized emotions of my friend.|$|E

500|$|Blue Dragon {{was first}} {{revealed}} on February 24, 2005 {{as one of}} two unnamed role-playing games in development by Mistwalker Studios for the console which later {{came to be known}} as the Xbox 360.

[...] Contributors to Blue Dragon include a number of well known Japanese figures in the gaming industry.

500|$|Although forty-eight {{drivers were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier; {{according}} to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only forty-three could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Reutimann clinched his second pole position in the Sprint Cup Series, {{with a time of}} 28.344. He was joined on the grid's front row by Jeff Gordon. Matt Kenseth qualified third, Ragan took fourth, and Paul Menard started fifth. Kahne, Tony Stewart, Kyle Busch, Johnson and Joey Logano rounded out the top ten qualifiers. The five drivers who failed to qualify were Joe Nemechek, Scott Speed, Jeremy Mayfield, Todd Bodine and Scott Riggs. After the qualifier Reutimann said, [...] "We had a great car all day, right off the truck.

500|$|Auden's clipped, satiric, and ironic {{style in}} the 1930s was widely imitated by younger poets such as Charles Madge, who wrote in a poem [...] "there waited <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer morning / Auden fiercely. I read, shuddered, and knew." [...] He was widely {{described}} {{as the leader of}} an [...] "Auden group" [...] that comprised his friends Stephen Spender, Cecil Day-Lewis, and Louis MacNeice. The four were mocked by the poet Roy Campbell as if they were a single undifferentiated poet named [...] "Macspaunday." [...] Auden's propagandistic poetic plays, including The Dog Beneath the Skin and The Ascent of F6, and his political poems such as [...] "Spain" [...] gave him the reputation as a political poet writing in a progressive and accessible voice, in contrast to Eliot; but this political stance provoked opposing opinions, such as that of Austin Clarke who called Auden's work [...] "liberal, democratic, and humane", and John Drummond, who wrote that Auden misused a [...] "characteristic and popularizing trick, the generalized image", to present ostensibly left-wing views that were in fact [...] "confined to bourgeois experience." ...|$|E

O'Donnell also introduced a distinctive piano theme which had never been heard before, and first made its appearance in the Halo 3 announcement teaser. In an interview, O'Donnell stated that he has always approached music from the keyboard, and that at the Electronic Entertainment Expo—where the trailer would first be shown—he had a feeling that, [...] "no [...] would start with a piano." [...] O'Donnell planned on composing the music [...] "at the last minute", saying {{he had no intention of}} producing a large amount of music that would never be used.

500|$|Class {{inequality}} in Swedish society {{was a strong}} and recurring theme in the Commission's findings. It appeared as a major motivator in the 289 personal narratives included in the report. These documents, of great research value and human interest today, were submitted by Swedes in Canada and the U.S. in response to requests in Swedish-American newspapers. The great majority of replies expressed enthusiasm for their new homeland and criticized conditions in Sweden. Bitter experiences of Swedish class snobbery still rankled after sometimes 40–50 years in America. Writers recalled the hard work, pitiful wages, and grim poverty {{of life in the}} Swedish countryside. One woman wrote from North Dakota of how in her Värmland home parish, she had had to earn her living in peasant households from the age of eight, starting work {{at four in the morning}} and living on [...] "rotten herring and potatoes, served out in small amounts so that I would not eat myself sick".

Aphrodite marked the first time Minogue enlisted an executive producer; discussing the process, she said [...] "It was just the best experience, and funnily enough I think it's the most cohesive album I've had since the beginning of my career, back in the PWL days, where by its very nature made it cohesive. There's a lot to be said for working with different producers and trying different stuff which has worked really well <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past but I definitely wanted someone to tie this together as Stuart has done so beautifully [...] so that it existed as a real body of work". Minogue and Price subjected songs on Aphrodite to a [...] "Parton Test", as they [...] "knew a song would work if it made sense when sung in the style of Dolly Parton". Shears also contributed to the album, while two of Pallot's collaborations with Minogue were kept. Additional collaborators on the album include Scottish disc jockey Calvin Harris, Swedish disc jockey Sebastian Ingrosso and Belgian musician Pascal Gabriel.|$|E

2500|$|The aerial {{campaign}} for Singapore {{began at the}} outset of the invasion of Malaya. Early on 8 December 1941, Singapore was bombed for the first time by long-range Japanese aircraft, such as the Mitsubishi G3M2 [...] "Nell" [...] and the Mitsubishi G4M1 [...] "Betty", based in Japanese-occupied Indochina. The bombers struck the city centre as well as the Sembawang Naval Base and the island's northern airfields. After this first raid, throughout the rest of December, there were a number of false alerts and several infrequent and sporadic hit-and-run attacks on outlying military installations such as the Naval Base, but no actual raids on Singapore City. The situation had become so desperate, that one British soldier took to the middle of a road to fire his Vickers machine gun at any aircraft that passed. He could only say: [...] "The bloody bastards will never think of looking <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open, and I want to see a bloody plane brought down." ...|$|E

His second film appearance was as a deaf-mute mob hitman in The Long Goodbye (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film Stay Hungry (1976), for which he was awarded a Golden Globe for New Male Star of the Year. Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career: [...] "It was very difficult <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> beginning– I was told by agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird', that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long.

Colonel Richardson, too, lauded him. He wrote in his after-action report, [...] "Meigs carried my orders promptly, and a braver and more gallant young man was never in service." [...] He also praised John {{in a letter to}} General Meigs, saying, the [...] "gallant conduct of your son, and his exertions in carrying orders <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field" [...] "recommended him to be immediately made a Lieut. in the regular Army."

George Perry for BBC.com found her to be [...] "extraordinary" [...] as an [...] "adoring mute who suffers [...] She uses her eyes to convey meaning, reviving techniques of silent cinema". Morton earned Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for Best Supporting Actress for her role, which was especially notable, considering the fact that she does not utter a single word of dialogue in the film.
