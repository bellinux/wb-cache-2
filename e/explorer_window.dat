25|$|The Windows Desktop Search {{functionality}} {{is exposed}} via a Windows Taskbar mounted deskbar. It provides a text field to type the query {{and the results}} are presented in a flyout pane. It also integrates as a Windows <b>Explorer</b> <b>window.</b> On selecting a file in the <b>Explorer</b> <b>window,</b> a preview of the file is shown in the right hand side of the window, without opening the application which created the file. Web searches can be initiated from both interfaces, but that will open the browser to search the terms using the default search engine.|$|E
25|$|Content is {{considered}} to be Unknown if the content sniffing process finds no categorisable content. This does not mean that there are no files present, just no files falling into {{one or more of the}} above three content types. In this case AutoPlay opens an <b>Explorer</b> <b>window</b> on the root directory of the medium and the process flow finishes here.|$|E

50|$|Any 32-bit <b>Windows</b> <b>Explorer</b> shell {{extensions}} fail to {{work with}} 64-bit <b>Windows</b> <b>Explorer.</b> However, <b>Windows</b> XP x64 Edition also ships with a 32-bit <b>Windows</b> <b>Explorer.</b> It is possible {{to make it the}} default Windows Shell.|$|R
25|$|There {{is also a}} Search Explorer, {{which is}} an {{integrated}} Windows <b>Explorer</b> <b>window</b> that is used for searches. It presents the user interface to specify the search parameters, including locations and file types that should be searched, and certain operators, without crafting the AQS queries by hand. With Windows Vista SP1, third party applications {{will be able to}} override the Search Explorer as the default search interface so that the registered third party application will be launched, instead of bringing up the Search Explorer, when invoked by any means.|$|E
25|$|Windows Explorer's task {{panel has}} been removed, {{integrating}} the relevant task options into the toolbar. A Favorites pane {{on the left}} contains commonly accessed folders and prepopulated Search Folders. Seven different views are available to view files and folders, namely, List, Details, Small icons, Medium icons, Large icons, Extra large icons or Tiles. File and folder actions such as Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo, Redo, Delete, Rename and Properties are built into a dropdown menu which appears when the Organize button is clicked. It is also possible to change {{the layout of the}} <b>Explorer</b> <b>window</b> by using the Organize button. Users can select whether to display Classic Menus, a Search Pane, a Preview Pane, a Reading Pane, and/or the Navigation Pane. Document Properties are available from the common 'Open' and 'Save' dialog boxes, so it is easier to add metadata (such as author or subject) to a document. The metadata can be viewed and edited in the Details Pane that shows up at the bottom of an <b>Explorer</b> <b>window.</b> The Navigation Pane contains a list of most common folders (the Favorites) for quick navigation. It can also show the folder layout of the entire hard drive or a subset of it. It can contain both real folders as well as virtual ones. By default it contains links to folders such as Documents and the publicly shared folder, as well as virtual folders that search and present the saved virtual folders and that lists the recently changed documents. The Preview Pane can be used to preview the contents of a document, including viewing pictures in a size larger than the thumbnails shown in the folder listing, and sampling contents of a media file, without opening any additional program. Explorer can show a preview for any image format if the necessary codec authored using the Windows Imaging Component is installed. Also, if an application installs Preview handlers (like Office 2007 does), then the documents can be edited in the preview pane itself.|$|E

50|$|AQT allows {{multiple}} database {{connections to}} be made. The connection {{can be made}} to any ODBC database defined. For each connection there is a database <b>explorer</b> <b>window.</b> The database explorer panel allows the user to display information about the database objects in that database. This is where AQT uses catalog queries rather than ODBC definition calls, which makes exploring database meta data very fast.|$|E
50|$|BitComet's chief {{features}} include an embedded Internet <b>Explorer</b> <b>window</b> to let users search for torrents. Along with the features typical of contemporary BitTorrent clients, it supports UPnP gateway configuration, bandwidth scheduling, Webseeding, selecting only certain files for download inside a torrent package, NAT traversal (removed in v.1.03), Peer Exchange (in older versions, using a proprietary protocol and starting with v.1.19 also {{by using the}} Extension Protocol, implementing a PEX mechanism compatible with µTorrent / Mainline PEX), Initial-Seeding (Super-Seeding) and support for Magnet Links.|$|E
5000|$|Moralityware is {{a subset}} of malware which infects a PC with the {{intention}} of imposing morality upon the user (for example, by blocking pornographic websites). The first cited example appeared in eWeek. [...] In the example cited, the trojan deemed Yusufali-A by Sophos is said to monitor Internet Explorer title bars for content potentially relating to pornography. Upon triggering, the Internet <b>Explorer</b> <b>window</b> will be minimized and a window will take its place, with a quote from the Koran translated into several languages.|$|E
50|$|With {{the release}} of Windows Vista & Server 2008 and <b>Windows</b> Internet <b>Explorer</b> 7 for <b>Windows</b> XP, Internet <b>Explorer</b> is no longer {{integrated}} with <b>Windows</b> <b>Explorer.</b> In <b>Windows</b> Vista and Server 2008 (and in Windows XP as well if IE7 or 8 is installed), <b>Windows</b> <b>Explorer</b> no longer displays web pages, and IE7 does not support use as a file manager, although one will separately launch the other as necessary.|$|R
50|$|There are {{significant}} changes made to <b>Windows</b> <b>Explorer</b> in <b>Windows</b> XP, both visually and functionally.

5000|$|ScrptExec {{is a free}} {{command line}} utility {{designed}} to execute simple scripts.
