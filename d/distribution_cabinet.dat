50|$|On Monday 23 January 2006 {{there was}} an {{explosion}} accident at the National Museum in the Silver Room, which was caused by methane leaking into a broom cupboard from the drainage through dried floor drain and lit by a spark from the power <b>distribution</b> <b>cabinet</b> in the cleaning closet. There were two possible sources for the methane; a leak from a gas pipe under the nearby Museokatu street, or gas that developed on its own in the sewer. Later, police investigations found the cause to be a gas pipe leak. http://www.hs.fi/uutiset/tuoreet/artikkeli/Kansallismuseon+r%C3%A4j%C3%A4hdyksen+syyn%C3%A4+maakaasuvuoto/1135218807492. Most display cases and only 49 pieces out of more than 200 silver objects in the museum's Silver Room were damaged in the explosion, although most of them only mildly. Nobody was hurt. All objects have been repaired during 2006. The Silver Room was re-opened to the public in early 2007.|$|E

40|$|What motivates {{political}} parties in the legislative arena? Existing legislative bargaining models stress parties’ office and policy motivations. A particularly important question concerns how parties in coalition government agree the <b>distribution</b> of <b>cabinet</b> seats. We add to this portfolio allocation literature by suggesting that future electoral considerations affect bargaining over the allocation of cabinet seats in multi-party cabinets. Some parties are penalized by voters for participating in government, increase the attractiveness of staying in opposition. This “cost of governing” shifts their seat reservation price– the minimum cabinet seats demanded in return for joining the coalition. Results of a randomized survey experiment of Irish legislators support our expectation, demonstrating that political elites are sensitive to future electoral losses when contemplating the <b>distribution</b> of <b>cabinet</b> seats.

40|$|Government {{formation}} in multiparty systems is of self-evident substantive importance, {{and the subject}} of an enormous theoretical literature. Empirical evaluations of models of government formation tend to separate government formation per se from the distribution of key government pay-offs, such as cabinet portfolios, between members of the resulting government. Models of government formation are necessarily specified ex ante, absent any knowledge of the government that forms. Models of the <b>distribution</b> of <b>cabinet</b> portfolios are typically, though not necessarily, specified ex post, taking into account knowledge of the identity of some government ‘formateur’ or even of the composition of the eventual cabinet. This disjunction {{lies at the heart of}} a notorious contradiction between predictions of the <b>distribution</b> of <b>cabinet</b> portfolios made by canonical models of legislative bargaining and the robust empirical regularity of proportional portfolio allocations – Gamson’s Law. This article resolves this contradiction by specifying and estimating a joint model of cabinet formation and portfolio distribution that, for example, predicts ex ante which parties will receive zero portfolios rather than taking this as given ex post. It concludes that canonical models of legislative bargaining do increase the ability to predict government membership, but that portfolio distribution between government members conforms robustly to a proportionality norm because portfolio distribution follows the much more difficult process of policy bargaining in the typical government formation process...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of {{the relations between the}} Executive and Legislative Federal, in Brazil, relate the support of the partisan coalition to government initiatives in Congress with the parties'representation of the base in the ministries. These approaches suppose an understanding that the <b>distribution</b> of <b>cabinet's</b> role in Executive branch fulfills the function of coordinating the actions of partisan coalition to government interests. It is intended in this study precisely qualify this coordination. How, in the exercise of their terms, presidents mobilize and organize their government to interact with the legislature and their partisan coalition? This is the starting point of this work. Under an analytical perspective that emphasizes organizational structure and attributions of the Presidency, precisely at the Civil House, the text discusses how, particularly, Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Luiz In 1 cio Lula da Silva managed the political coordination of their government. Under an institutional approach, introduced in the field of presidential studies by Terry Moe, the work intends to analyze the president's levels of control on political coordination structures project in the Presidency. It is argued that in some periods, to galvanize the support of their coalition, the presidents not only expand the representation of their partisan base in cabinet's role in Executive branch, but grant spaces in their own power structure, the Presidency, {{to the members of the}} coalition.

40|$|European Centre for Minority Issues, Flensburg, Germany Abstract. This article {{examines}} how presidential {{involvement in the}} cabinet formation process affects cabinet formation outcomes in the semi-presidential regimes of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. It analyzes whether the formal distribution of appoint-ment-dismissal powers allows {{for the development of}} useful indicators for predicting a prime minister’s location on the continuum between the ideal points of the president and the leg-islature. First, to derive theoretical expectations about a prime minister’s identity in the dif-ferent types of semi-presidential regimes, the article discusses constitutional variation in the formal <b>distribution</b> of <b>cabinet</b> appointment-dismissal powers across semi-presidential con-stitutions. Second, the empirical outcomes of cabinet formation are then compared with the theoretical predictions. Empirical tests, while providing substantial support for the hypoth-esized effect of variation in cabinet appointment-dismissal powers, indicate the importance of other variables. Qualitative and quantitative differences in the character of the party system {{and the nature of the}} electoral cycle also have a systematic effect on cabinet for-mation outcomes. Variations in constitutional design have the potential to explain important political outcomes in the analysis of cabinet formation under different types of constitutional regimes. Most literature on cabinet formation in parliamen-tary regimes with indirectly elected presidents assumes that the presidential role in nominating of the prime minister is not strategic (Laver & Schofield 1990; Laver & Shepsle 1996). At the same time, academic scholarship on semi-presidential regimes describes presidential participation in cabinet formation as highly significant. Since Duverger’s (1980) seminal article on semi-presidentialism, presidential involvement in cabinet formation matters has been considered to be of great importance for understanding how semi...|$|R

The BVP refused to accept Koch-Weser as minister of the interior, arguing he was too much in favour of a unitary rather than a federal state. On 19 January, Hindenburg called on the party leaders to put the interests of the fatherland above their doubts and send him a list of ministers. Luther was able to do so, after the DDP had agreed to Koch-Weser remaining out of the cabinet and to being represented by Wilhelm Külz (Interior) and [...] (Finance) instead.

40|$|Why {{and under}} what {{conditions}} do governments borrow before elections? This thesis aims {{to shed light on}} this question by exploring governments' incentives that give rise to political budget cycles, i. e. fluctuations in the budget balance during election times, under different political, institutional, and economic contexts. The argument will be developed in three stages. First, the thesis will explain why politicians may choose to use debt strategically to win elections and discuss and evaluate different models that can explain political budget cycles. One model, a moral hazard type competence model is, as will be shown, particularly suited for this study. It will be extended in stages two and three. The second stage will look at the benefits and costs from public debt, with a particular emphasis on the likelihood of re-election (government popularity), party system polarisation, and sovereign risk. Sovereign risk increases the cost of borrowing and thus dampens the magnitude of political budget cycles; the effect of government popularity on strategic debt is conditional on the degree of polarisation. The third stage will take the motives to borrow as given and examine the effectiveness of debt as a strategic instrument. The less voters attribute responsibility for fiscal policy to governments, the less effective debt is as a strategic instrument. Economic volatility, regulatory density, and economic openness, this thesis argues, reduce this effectiveness and in turn the political budget cycle. Similarly, coalition government reduces responsibility associated with individual coalition partners, and thus the strategic value of public debt - yet this effect is moderated by the <b>distribution</b> of <b>cabinet</b> portfolios. The argument in this thesis is based both on formal models and on empirical, time series-cross sectional, analyses. It is arguably the most comprehensive treatment of political budget cycles and adds to an increasing literature on the contextual determinants of fiscal policy.
