25|$|Fluids are {{commonly}} given, either orally by nasogastric tube or by intravenous catheter, to restore proper hydration and electrolyte balance. In cases of strangulating obstruction or enteritis, the intestine will have decreased absorption and increased secretion of fluid into the intestinal lumen, making oral fluids ineffective and possibly dangerous if they cause gastric distention and rupture. This process of secretion into the intestinal lumen leads to dehydration, and these horse require {{large amounts of}} IV fluids to prevent hypotension and subsequent cardiovascular collapse. Fluid rates are calculated by adding the fluid lost during each collection of gastric reflux to the daily maintenance requirement of the horse. Due {{to the fact that}} horses absorb water in the cecum and colon, the <b>IV</b> <b>fluid</b> requirement of horses with simple obstruction is dependent on the location of the obstruction. Those that are obstructed further distally, such as at the pelvic flexure, are able to absorb more oral fluid than those obstructed in the small intestine, and therefore require less <b>IV</b> <b>fluid</b> support. Impactions are usually managed with fluids for 3â€“5 days before surgery is considered. Fluids are given based on results of the physical examination, such as mucous membrane quality, PCV, and electrolyte levels. Horses in circulatory shock, such as those suffering from endotoxemia, require very high rates of <b>IV</b> <b>fluid</b> administration. Oral fluids via nasogastric tube are often given in the case of impactions to help lubricate the obstruction. Oral fluids should not be given if significant amounts of nasogastric reflux are obtained. Access to food and water will often be denied to allow careful monitoring and administration of what is taken in by the horse.|$|E

40|$|Clinical Issue Health Canada {{recommends}} exclusive breastfeeding for {{the first}} 6 months post birth and then the addition of complementary foods with breastfeeding extending to {{a minimum of two}} years. Breastfeeding initiation rates in Canada are currently at around 87 % but, by one month, about 21 % of women have stopped breastfeeding. Engorgement and edema in breast tissue can lead to breastfeeding challenges which may contribute to early weaning. Purpose The purpose of this pilot research study was to explore the relationship between intravenous (<b>IV)</b> <b>fluids</b> given to mothers during the peripartum period and postpartum breast or nipple swelling in the first ten days postpartum and determine if a larger study was warranted and feasible. The research question for this pilot study was, "What is the relationship between the amount of <b>IV</b> <b>fluids</b> given to labouring women and edema of the breast and areola complex experienced by breastfeeding women in the first 10 days postpartum?" Methods It is a prospective, longitudinal, observational cohort pilot study with repeated measures and a within-subjects design. Participants are first time mothers who planned to exclusively breastfeed and gave birth to a single, healthy newborn by means of a spontaneous vaginal birth, Mother and baby were discharged home together with no contraindications to exclusive unrestricted breastfeeding. Descriptive statistics are reported and linear regression analysis is used to model the relationship between IV therapy and postpartum breast edema. Results Women who received <b>IV</b> <b>fluids</b> during labour had higher levels of edema postpartum and rated their breasts as firmer as and more tender than women who did not receive <b>IV</b> <b>fluids.</b> Participants who had <b>IV</b> <b>fluids</b> appeared to be less aware of the fullness associated with lactogenesis II, and the pattern of fullness they described appeared to be related to edema noted. Participants who did not have <b>IV</b> <b>fluids</b> appeared to have unrelated patterns of fullness and edema, and therefore appeared more aware of the onset of lactogenesis II. The results support a larger study about the relationships between maternal perinatal <b>IV</b> <b>fluids</b> and breast or nipple changes...|$|R

2500|$|Infiltration {{occurs when}} an <b>IV</b> <b>fluid</b> or {{medication}} accidentally enters the surrounding tissue {{rather than the}} vein. It may occur when the vein itself ruptures (the elderly are particularly prone to fragile veins due to a paucity of supporting tissues), when the vein is damaged during insertion of the intravascular access device, when the device is not sited correctly, from increased vein porosity or when the entry point of the device into the vein becomes {{the path of least}} resistance (e.g. if a cannula is in a vein for some time, the vein may scar and close and the only way for fluid to leave is along the outside of the cannula where it enters the vein). Infiltration is an inadvertent administration of a nonvesicant solution/drug into the tissue, which happens so often when the tourniquet isn't removed in a timely fashion. [...] Infiltration is characterized by coolness and pallor to the skin as well as localized swelling or edema. It is treated by removing the intravenous access device and elevating the affected limb so that the collected fluids can drain away. Sometimes injections of hyaluronidase can be used to speed the dispersal of the fluid/drug. Infiltration is one of the most common adverse effects of IV therapy and is usually not serious unless the infiltrated fluid is a medication damaging to the surrounding tissue, most commonly a vesicant or chemotherapeutic agent, in which case it is called extravasation and extensive necrosis can occur.|$|E
