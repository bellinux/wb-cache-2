40|$|Cervical necrotizing {{fasciitis}} {{is an unusual}} infection characterized by necrosis of the subcutaneous tissue and fascial layers. Risk factors {{for the development of}} {{necrotizing fasciitis}} include diabetes mellitus, chronic renal disease, peripheral vascular disease, malnutrition, advanced age, obesity, alcohol abuse, intravenous drug use, surgery, and ischemic ulcers. This report presents a case of necrotizing fasciitis in the cervical area caused by dental extraction in a 73 -year-old woman. Cervical necrotizing fasciitis in geriatric patient is rare, and even when establishing the diagnosis and having <b>it</b> timely <b>treated,</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> can suffer irreversible damage or even death. Clinical manifestations {{in the head and neck}} usually have an acute onset characterized by severe pain, swelling, redness, erythema, presence of necrotic tissue, and in severe cases obstruction of the upper airways.

40|$|AIM: We are {{presenting}} {{an uncommon}} case of pulmonary embolism, followed with an acute myocardial infarction, {{in a patient}} with progressive systemic sclerosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A female 40 years of age was admitted with signs of pulmonary embolism, confirmed with CT scan, which also reviled a thrombus in the right ventricle. <b>The</b> <b>patient</b> had medical history of systemic sclerosis {{since the age of}} 16 years. She suffered an ischemic stroke 6 years ago, but she was not taking any anticoagulant or antithrombotic medications ever since. She received a treatment with thrombolytic therapy, and subsequent UFH, but, on the second day after receiving fibrinolysis, she felt chest pain accompanied with ECG changes consistent for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Urgent coronary angiography was undertaken, which reviled cloths causing total occlusion in 4 blood vessels, followed with thromboaspiration, but without successful reperfusion. Several hours later <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> developed rapid deterioration with letal ending. During the very short hospital course, blood sampling reviled presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. CONCLUSION: The acquired antiphospholipid syndrome is common condition in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases, but relatively rare in patients with systemic sclerosis.

Presentation of caseA 73 -year-old man {{was admitted to}} our hospital with bloody feces. He was diagnosed with synchronous triple cancers of the esophagus, colon, and liver. We selected a two-stage operation to safely achieve curative resection for all three cancers. The first stage of the operation comprised a laparoscopy-assisted sigmoidectomy and partial liver resection via open surgery. <b>The</b> <b>patient</b> was discharged without complications. Thirty days later, he was readmitted and thoracoscopic esophagectomy was performed.

DiscussionEsophagectomy is a highly invasive procedure; thus, simultaneous surgery for plural organs, including the esophagus, may induce life-threatening, severe complications. Two-stage surgery is useful in reducing surgical stress in high-risk patients.

40|$|Parsonage-Turner {{syndrome}} (PTS) is {{a distinct}} clinical syndrome, characterized by acute and severe (mostly) unilateral shoulder pain, followed by paresis and atrophy of the shoulder girdle, while the pain decreases. Most authors consider it as an immune-mediated disorder. PTS is notoriously unrecognised and is usually diagnosed with delay. A PTS may also occur following a surgical procedure. Postsurgical PTS is an under-recognised and challenging clinical entity, as illustrated in the case reported here of a 59 -year-old man, 4 weeks after anterior discectomy and fusion C 5 C 7. In such cases, the differential diagnosis must be made with a complication of surgery, such as postoperative C 5 palsy due for instance to a migrated bone graft. Arguments for PTS are: a certain delay between surgery and symptoms, intolerable pain followed by weakness and improvement of pain complaints, divergent distribution of weakness, sensory deficit and pain, which may be confirmed by electrodiagnosis. Early recognition of postsurgical PTS may avoid unnecessary investigations or surgical exploration. <b>It</b> allows to <b>treat</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> properly, leading to greater satisfaction of both surgeon and patient; pain management, physical therapy and reassurance are the cornerstones. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} how nurses in Kerala experience the caring of terminally ill <b>patients</b> and how <b>the</b> nurses provide care to promote the wellbeing among these patients. Being terminally ill is threatening for the quality of life and palliative care is important to promote the wellbeing of <b>the</b> <b>patient.</b> <b>The</b> number of immigrants in Sweden is increasing which makes it relevant to study various cultures to acknowledge patients’ different needs and wishes. Six registered nurses in one hospital in Kerala, India, were interviewed. All the nurses had experience of palliative care. The interviews were recorded and analyzed using an inductive approach. Three categories emerged from the analyzed material and they were; loneliness, wellbeing and dealing with work related emotions. It was evident in the result that the nurses found it important to care for <b>the</b> <b>patient’s</b> physical and psychological needs to promote the wellbeing. The result also showed that encountering patients like a fellow human being is essential when treating terminally ill patients, which is especially important to prevent feelings of loneliness.

40|$|The {{most common}} {{malignant}} brain tumor in adults is a glioma called glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). About 300 persons are diagnosed with GBM {{every year in}} Sweden. Unfortunately, {{it is also the}} most aggressive brain tumor and as of today, {{it is not possible to}} cure <b>it.</b> Despite <b>treating</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, the median survival is only 15 months. The main problem with GBM is its infiltrative growth. As the tumor cells leave the tumor bulk and migrate into the normal brain parenchyma, it is impossible to reach them with the current standard treatments. Hence, even after treatment, some tumor cells will remain in the brain and eventually give rise to a new tumor. To be able to reach the migrating cells, new treatment strategies need to be developed. One such strategy is to use stem cells as drug delivery vehicles. It has been shown that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) derived from the bone marrow (BM) have the ability to specifically migrate throughout a glioma. Upon intratumoral transplantation, they spread within the tumor, along its extensions and toward migrating tumor cells that has left the main tumor bulk, making BM-MSCs ideal as transporters of anti-tumoral substances. However, several safety concerns have been raised as MSCs also have shown to mediate tumor growth by acting immunosuppressive and contribute to the tumor stroma and vascularization. This thesis will discuss 1) the role of endogenous MSCs in malignant glioma and 2) the use of transplanted BM-MSCs as glioma treatment. We have shown that human malignant gliomas harbor two distinct cell populations that resemble BM-MSCs. We have characterized the cells and conclude that they most likely play an important role in tumor angiogenesis and immunosuppression. Further on, we have seen that MSC-like pericytes within the normal mouse brain are activated by, and migrate into, an orthotopic glioma model. The cells align perivascularly and contribute the majority of all pericytes within the tumor. To evaluate their tumor-tropism, MSCs were derived from rat bone marrow and transplanted into, and adjacent to, orthotopic rat gliomas. We conclude that even though they show strong tumor-tropic migration capabilities upon intratumoral transplantation they do not migrate when transplanted into the normal brain of tumor bearing animals. We also report that intratumorally transplanted BM-MSCs potentiate the effect of peripheral immunotherapy against malignant gliomas, demonstrating their use in a therapeutic setting...|$|R
