5|$|The {{death of}} El-Sherbini {{immediately}} resulted in international reactions, {{with the most}} vocal responses coming from predominantly Muslim nations. The Egyptian public and media focused attention on the religious and racial hatred aspect of the killing, especially as the initial confrontation between the victim and perpetrator had happened because she wore an <b>Islamic</b> <b>headscarf.</b> In response to anti-German sentiments and public protests in Egypt and other countries, the German government issued a statement of condolence nine days after the incident. Wiens's trial for murder and attempted murder occurred under strict security measures and was observed by national and international media, diplomats and legal experts.|$|E
5|$|On 15 February 2002, {{while at}} Speakers' Corner, Singapore Democratic Party chief Chee Soon Juan {{attacked}} the Government's decision to suspend four Muslim girls for wearing the tudung (<b>Islamic</b> <b>headscarf)</b> to public schools. Contrary to police advice, {{he chose not}} to apply for a public entertainment licence, arguing he did not need one. Chee's speech sparked heated exchanges involving the Sikh practice of wearing turbans. In July, Chee was convicted and fined S$3,000 for speaking without the required licence. In his judgment, District Judge Kow Keng Siong emphasized the twin considerations of public order and national security in multi-racial and multi-religious Singapore, finding that Chee's speech had bred social unrest. Under the Constitution of Singapore, a person who has been fined at least $2,000 cannot stand for election to Parliament for five years. As a result of the incident, Chee was barred from contesting the 2006 general elections.|$|E
5|$|The Government's {{adherence}} to secularism {{has been criticized}} in that the unwritten principle of secularism has trumped the constitutional protection of freedom of religion. For instance, in 2002 a controversy arose upon the suspension of four Muslim girls from school when their parents insisted that they wear the tudung (<b>Islamic</b> <b>headscarf)</b> to national schools. Section 61 of the Education Act empowers the Minister for Education to regulate schools, including prohibiting students from wearing anything not forming part of an official school uniform. The parents of the schoolgirls took {{the view that the}} Ministry of Education's school uniform policy was unconstitutional as it violated the girls' freedom of religion under Article 15(1). While the parents eventually did not pursue legal proceedings against the Ministry, the controversy showed the Singapore Government's steadfastness in insisting on secularism and the difficulties in reconciling secularism and freedom of religion in Singapore.|$|E
5000|$|Al-Ghul {{was born}} in 1982 in Rafah, a Gazan city {{bordering}} Egypt whose population is mainly Palestinian refugees. In 2003, she married an Egyptian poet and moved to Abu Dhabi. She and her husband later divorced, and she returned to Gaza with their son. In 2006, al-Ghul permanently took off her <b>Islamic</b> khimār (<b>headscarf).</b>|$|R
50|$|An ongoing {{topic of}} {{controversy}} {{is whether the}} separation of Church and State should be weakened so {{that the government would}} be able to subsidize Muslim prayer rooms and the formation of imams. Advocates of such measures, such as Nicolas Sarkozy at times, declare that they would encourage the Muslim population to better integrate into the fabric of French society. Opponents contend that the state should not fund religions. Furthermore, the state ban on wearing conspicuous religious symbols, such as the <b>Islamic</b> female <b>headscarf,</b> in public schools has alienated some French Muslims, provoked minor street protests and drawn some international criticism.|$|R
25|$|The {{issue of}} Muslim hijabs has sparked {{controversy}} after several girls refused to uncover {{their heads in}} class, as early as 1989. In October 1989, three Muslim schoolgirls wearing the <b>Islamic</b> <b>headscarf</b> were expelled from the collège Gabriel-Havez in Creil (north of Paris). In November, the First Conseil d'État ruling affirmed that the wearing of the <b>Islamic</b> <b>headscarf,</b> {{as a symbol of}} freedom of religious expression, in public schools was not incompatible with the French school system and the system of laïcité. In December, a first ministerial circular (circulaire Jospin) was published, stating teachers had to decide on a case-by-case basis whether to ban the wearing of <b>Islamic</b> <b>headscarf.</b>|$|E
25|$|Williams {{objected to}} a {{proposed}} French law banning {{the wearing of}} the hijab, a traditional <b>Islamic</b> <b>headscarf</b> for women, in French schools. He said that the hijab and any other religious symbols should not be outlawed.|$|E
25|$|On 25 April when {{inquired about}} his wife's <b>Islamic</b> <b>headscarf,</b> Gül responded by saying his wife's {{decision}} should be respected and {{treated as a}} personal right. The same day there was an assassination attempt on the YÖK president Dr. Erdoğan Teziç {{who is known for}} his secularist remarks. Three rounds were fired by a 30-year-old man identified as Nurullah İlgün. İlgün was arrested the same day.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, many Muslim women {{experience}} significant barriers to sports participation. These barriers include bans on the <b>Islamic</b> <b>headscarf,</b> {{commonly known as}} the hijab, cultural and familial barriers, and the lack of appropriate sports programs and facilities. Many Muslim female athletes have overcome these obstacles and used sports to empower themselves and others, such as through education, health and wellbeing, and a push for women's rights.|$|E
25|$|In January 1990, three schoolgirls were {{expelled}} from the collège Pasteur in Noyon, north of Paris. The parents of one expelled schoolgirl filed a defamation action against {{the principal of the}} collège Gabriel-Havez in Creil. As a result, the teachers of a collège in Nantua (eastern part of France, just to the west of Geneva, Switzerland) went on strike to protest the wearing of the <b>Islamic</b> <b>headscarf</b> in school. A second ministerial circular was published in October, to restate the need to respect the principle of laïcité in public schools.|$|E
500|$|On 21 August 2008, Wiens and El-Sherbini met at {{a public}} {{playground}} in Dresden's Johannstadt district, where Wiens's niece and El-Sherbini's son were playing. During a quarrel over whose child should be using the playground's swing, Wiens began shouting verbal abuse at El-Sherbini. El-Sherbini who was wearing an <b>Islamic</b> <b>headscarf,</b> was called [...] "Islamist", [...] "terrorist" [...] and (according to one report) [...] "slut". Other people present tried to intervene, but Wiens vehemently continued the verbal abuse for several minutes, directing epithets in Russian and German at the Russian-speaking bystanders who attempted to reason with him. El-Sherbini called the police on a bystander's mobile phone {{and within a few}} minutes four police officers arrived in two vehicles at the scene. El-Sherbini and Wiens were questioned; El-Sherbini was subsequently driven away in one of the police vehicles.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 July 2009, Marwa El-Sherbini {{was stabbed}} {{to death in a}} {{courtroom}} in Dresden, Germany. She had just given evidence against her attacker who had used insults against her because she wore an <b>Islamic</b> <b>headscarf.</b> El-Sherbini was called [...] "Islamist", [...] "terrorist" [...] and (according to one report) [...] "slut".|$|E
2500|$|In September 1994, a third ministerial {{circular}} (circulaire Bayrou) was published, {{making a}} distinction between [...] "discreet" [...] symbols to be tolerated in public schools, and [...] "ostentatious" [...] symbols, including the <b>Islamic</b> <b>headscarf,</b> to be banned from public schools. In October, some students demonstrated at the lycée Saint Exupéry in Mantes-la-Jolie (northwest of Paris) to support the freedom to wear Islamic headscarves in school. In November, approximately twenty-four veiled schoolgirls were expelled from the lycée Saint Exupéry in Mantes-la-Jolie and the lycée Faidherbe in Lille.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2008 Ebadi {{released}} a statement saying: [...] "Threats against my life and security and those of my family, which began some time ago, have intensified," [...] and that the threats warned her against making speeches abroad, and defending Iran's minority Baha'i community. In August 2008, the IRNA news agency published an article attacking Ebadi's links to the Bahá'í Faith and accused her of seeking support from the West. It also criticized Ebadi for defending homosexuals, appearing without the <b>Islamic</b> <b>headscarf</b> abroad, questioning Islamic punishments, and [...] "defending CIA agents." [...] It accused her daughter, Nargess Tavassolian, of conversion to the Bahá'í faith, a capital offense in the Islamic Republic. Her daughter believes [...] "the government wanted to scare my mother with this scenario." [...] Ebadi believes the attacks are in retaliation for her agreeing to defend {{the families of the}} seven Baha’is arrested in May.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 April {{after these}} weeks of debate over who would {{run for the}} presidency, foreign {{minister}} Abdullah Gül was put forward as the only candidate. Jonathan Rugman, a British reporter in Turkey for the Guardian, had published an article on 27 November 1995 following an interview with Abdullah Gül, who was then {{a member of the}} Welfare Party and made remarks such as [...] "the Republican Era is over" [...] Immediately following the announcement, a group of 14 people was arrested for gathering to protest his candidacy in front of the Çankaya Palace (the presidential complex). After the arrest, smaller groups also gathered, chanting [...] "if carrying the Turkish flag is a crime, take us too" [...] (...) [...] Drivers passing by reportedly showed support by waving flags from their cars. A similar protest took place in Kuğulu park. When asked about this at a reception, General Ergin Saygun responded by quoting the [...] 12 April speech of Yaşar Büyükanıt. When further inquired what he thought about the new commander-in-chief's wife having an <b>Islamic</b> <b>headscarf,</b> Saygun replied by saying that {{the answer to the question}} was inside it.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Islamic</b> <b>headscarf,</b> worn by {{more than}} 20% of Turkish women, is allowed to women working in public offices during the {{practice}} of their functions. Girl students in primary and secondary education also are allowed to use headscarf.|$|E
50|$|Şahin (born in Istanbul in 1973) {{came from}} a {{traditional}} family of practising Muslims and considered it her religious duty to wear the <b>Islamic</b> <b>headscarf.</b> After studying in Vienna, in 1998 she was a fifth-year student at the faculty of medicine of the University of Istanbul. On 23 February of that year the Vice-Chancellor of the University issued a circular directing that students with beards and students wearing the <b>Islamic</b> <b>headscarf</b> would be refused admission to lectures, courses and tutorials. In March Şahin was denied access to a written examination {{on one of the}} subjects she was studying because was wearing the <b>Islamic</b> <b>headscarf.</b> Subsequently the university authorities refused, on the same grounds, to allow her to enrol her in a course, or to admit her to various lectures and a written examination. The university also issued her with a warning for contravening the university's rules on dress and suspended her from the university for a term for taking part in an unauthorised assembly that had gathered to protest against them. All the disciplinary penalties imposed on the applicant were revoked under an amnesty law.|$|E

50|$|Still, Muslim {{women are}} {{underrepresented}} in athletic arenas, {{from school and}} amateur sports to international competitions.

50|$|The {{biggest issue}} that caused deep {{fissures}} between {{the army and}} the government was the midnight e-memorandum posted on the military’s website objecting to the selection of Foreign Minister Abdullah Gül as the ruling party’s candidate for the Presidency in 2007. The military argued that the election of Gül, whose wife wears an <b>Islamic</b> <b>headscarf,</b> could undermine the laicistic order of the country.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, 86% of {{respondents}} {{in a poll}} for i-Télé were in favour of a ban for headscarfs and other religious and political symbols in {{both public and private}} institutions for children.

5000|$|The alleged {{reasoning}} for {{the murder}} of Mustafa Yücel Özbilgin and wounding of four of his fellow judges was that they had previously voted against a Turkish school teacher being allowed to wear a traditional <b>Islamic</b> <b>headscarf</b> outside work.
