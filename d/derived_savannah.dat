The climate is sub-humid tropical with a longtime average annual rainfall of 1,909.30mm. Ayetoro is about 35 km northwest of Abeokuta, a town in south-west part of Nigeria and the capital of Ogun State. The town is the administrative seat/headquarters of Yewa (formally known as Egbado) North Local Government Area. It is connected to Lagos by road and rail and serves as the shipping centre for {{an area in which}} cocoa, cassava, cowpea and maize are produced. It is located in the Derived savanna agro ecological zone. Ayetoro lies between 90 and 120-m above sea-level. The entire area is made up of an undulating surface drained mainly by Rori and Ayinbo rivers. The landform is that of eroded pediment plain with well-incised valleys forming a trellis pattern. The soils are developed over a deeply weathered layer of sedimentary rocks consisting of false bedded sandstones which underlies the area. The sediments are of lower cretaceous rocks or Abeokuta formation (Smyth and Montgomery, 1962) which spread monotonously in northwest and southwest directions.

40|$|In {{reference}} 1 {{the authors}} described {gamma}-ray holdup assay of a Mossbauer spectroscopy instrument where they utilized two axial symmetric cylindrical shell acquisitions and two disk source acquisitions to determine Am- 241 and Np- 237 contamination. The measured {{contents of the}} two species were determined using a general detector efficiency calibration taken from a 12 -inch point source. 2 The authors corrected the raw spectra for container absorption {{as well as for}} geometry corrections to transform the calibration curve to the applicable axial symmetric cylindrical source - and disk source - of contamination. The authors derived the geometry corrections with exact calculus that are shown in equations (1) and (2) of our Experimental section. A cylindrical shell (oven source) acquisition configuration is described in reference 3, where the authors disclosed this configuration to gain improved sensitivity for holdup measure of U- 235 in a ten-chamber oven. The oven was a piece of process equipment used in the Savannah River Plant M-Area Uranium Fuel Fabrication plant for which a U- 235 holdup measurement was necessary for its decontamination and decommissioning in 2003. 4 In reference 4 the authors calibrated a bare NaI detector for these U- 235 holdup measurements. In references 5 and 6 the authors calibrated a bare HpGe detector in a cylindrical shell configuration for improved sensitivity measurements of U- 235 in other M-Area process equipment. Sensitivity was vastly improved compared to a close field view of the sample, with detection efficiency of greater than 1 % for the 185. 7 -keV {gamma}-ray from U- 235. In none of references 3 - 7 did the authors resolve the exact calculus descriptions of the acquisition configurations. Only the empirical efficiency for detection of the 185. 7 -keV photon from U- 235 decay was obtained. Not until the 2010 paper of reference 1 did the authors derive a good theoretical description of the flux of photons onto the front face of a detector from an axially symmetric cylindrical shell. Subsequent to publication of 1, the theoretical treatment of the cylindrical shell and disk source acquisition sources was recognized by the Los Alamos National Laboratory as suitable for including in the Safeguards Training Program. 8 Therefore, we felt it was important to accurately demonstrate the calculus describing the cylindrical shell configuration for the HpGe detector and to theoretically account for the observed bare-detector efficiencies measured in references (3 - 6). In this paper we demonstrate the applicability of the cylindrical shell derivation to a flexible planar sheet of known Am- 241, Eu- 152, and Cs- 137 activity that we rolled into a symmetrical cylindrical shell of radioactivity. Using the geometry correction equation of reference 1, we calculate geometry correction values using the known detector and source dimensions combined with source to detector distances. We then compare measured detection efficiencies from a cylindrical shell of activity for the 185. 7 -keV photon (U- 235) and for the 414. 3 -keV photon (Pu- 239) with those determined for a 12 -inch point source(2, 7) to demonstrate agreement between experiment and the theoretically calculated values <b>derived</b> by the <b>Savannah</b> River National Laboratory (SRNL) authors of reference 1. We demonstrate this geometry correction first for the 185. 7 - and 414. 3 -keV {gamma}-rays. But because the detector was point source calibrated at 12 inches for the energy range (60 - 1700) keV (using two distinct sources) to map its intrinsic efficiency, the geometry correction for any acquisition configuration holds for all photon energies. 2 We demonstrate that for ten photon energies in the range 121 keV to 967 keV. The good agreement between experiment and calculation is demonstrated at five source to detector distances using the identical shielded HpGe detector of references 4 - 7 as well as with a separate HpGe detector. We then extend the measurement to include a single acquisition where the flexible source is wrapped around the bare detector in a symmetrical cylinder that radiates on both faces of the detector as well as on to the detector's cylindrical sides of known dimensions. We derive the exact calculus to calculate the flux of the source on to the cylindrical sides of the detector. We then demonstrate outstanding agreement between the measured efficiency for the two primary U- 235 and Pu- 239 photons in this oven source configuration compared to the point source of activity for which the detector was originally calibrated...|$|R

Seven Musa genotypes comprising five plantain hybrids, one cooking banana hybrid and a local check were evaluated in three agro-ecologies in southern Nigeria, for two crops cycles. The MET sites were Onne (rain forest ecology), Ibadan (Forest-Savannah transition zone) and Nsukka (<b>Derived</b> <b>savannah</b> ecology). Data on growth, yield components and disease response traits were subjected to the analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test the main and interaction effects of sites, genotypes and crop cycles. Yield stability and adaptation pattern of genotypes were examined with AMMI, GGE biplot, YSi and linear regression models. Results indicated that the effects of sites and genotypes were significant (P < 0. 05) on most traits studied, except fruit length and circumference. However, crop cycle did not have any significant effect on components of yield. Second order interaction significantly (P< 0. 05) influenced growth traits, number of fruits and fruit weight.

The reproductive traits like number of staminate flowers per plant, number of pistillate flowers per plant, fruit length, fruit girth, fruit weight per plant, number of fruits per plant, average fruit weight and total fruit yield per hectare were also recorded. Obtained data was subjected to analysis of variance in randomized complete block design and path analysis. The results showed a highly significant difference (p< 0. 01) among the genotypes in all the traits studied in both seasons. ‘Beit Alpha’ genotype gave the highest fruit yield/ha in early season planting, while in the late season, the highest yield producer was ‘Ashely’.

Based on the conflict severity the two agro-ecological zones were stratified into core and outside conflict areas. Using farmers register as sampling frame work 60 and 67 farmers were randomly selected in core and outside violent conflict areas of rainforest and savannah zones respectively. Interview schedule instrument was used to collect data while frequency count, percentage t-test and ANOVA were statistical tools used for data analysis. The findings revealed that in Core Violent Conflict Area (CVCA) of rainforest and <b>derived</b> <b>savannah</b> areas 72. 1 % and 23. 8 % of the farmers were displaced from their farms respectively. Consequently tree (cocoa) crops production level were severely affected as reflected in lower (  295) and higher mean (  697) cocoa production level in tons recorded in CVCA and Outside Violent Conflict Areas (OVCA) respectively in rainforest areas.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} at the Teaching and Research farm of the University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, located between longitude 7015 ’N and latitude 3025 ’E, a <b>derived</b> <b>savannah</b> in south western Nigeria. The study was carried out between April to September 2009 and March to August 2010 to investigate the effect of varying populations of two local cowpea varieties of contrasting growth habits on green manure production, using maize as test crop. Three population densities each of cowpea varieties Oloyin and Drum, and the control plots were arranged in a Randomized Complete Block Design and replicated three times. Six weeks after planting, the green manure was uprooted and incorporated in situ. The incorporated green manure was left for a week after which maize variety- SUWAN-IY was planted on all plots. All populations of cowpea variety Oloyin gave significantly higher biomass than all the populations of Drum in 2009; the highest significant fresh biomass was produced at 111, 111 plants/ha. In 2010, Drum at 160, 000 plants/ha and Oloyin at 111, 111 plants/ha produced similar plant biomass (p> 0. 05) and {{were significantly higher than}} all other treatments. However...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This study {{examined}} the comparative utilization of 30 % inclusion levels of three vegetable protein sources [Groundnut Cake (GNC); Soybean Meal (SBM) and Cotton Seed Cake (CSC) ] in the diets of growing and laying Japanese quails. The findings showed no significant variations (P> 0. 05) on feed intake, weight gain and feed/gain ratio during the growing period among the vegetable protein sources fed. Attainment of sexual maturity (age at first egg laid) was 60, 61 and 62 days for SBM, CSC and GNC based diets, respectively while weight of first egg laid was 9. 95, 9. 25 and 9. 40 g, respectively. At the laying period, results indicated no significant differences among the treatment means for the performance and egg quality parameters measured. However, laying performance and egg quality traits were in general, numerically better (P> 0. 05) in quails fed SBM compared to CSC and GNC diets. The results suggested that the three vegetable protein sources could be used interchangeably in the diets of growing and laying Japanese quails reared in the <b>derived</b> <b>Savannah</b> zone of Nigeria.

40|$|Nitrogen (N) rhizodeposition by {{grain legumes}} such as soybean is {{potentially}} a large but neglected source of N in cropping systems of Sub-Saharan Africa. Field studies {{were conducted to}} measure soybean N rhizodeposition in two environments of the Guinean savannah of Nigeria using 15 N leaf labelling techniques. The first site was located in Ibadan in the humid <b>derived</b> <b>savannah.</b> The second site was in Zaria in the drier Northern Guinean savannah. Soybean N rhizodeposition in the top 0. 30 m of soil varied from 7. 5 kg ha- 1 on a diseased crop in Ibadan to 33 kg ha- 1 in Zaria. More than two-thirds of soybean belowground N was contained in the rhizodeposits at crop physiological maturity, while the rest {{was found in the}} recoverable roots. Belowground plant-derived N was found to constitute 16 – 23 % of the total soybean N. Taking rhizodeposited pools into account led to N budgets close to zero when all residues were removed. If residues were left in the field or recycled as manure after being fed to steers, soybean cultivation led to positive N budgets of up to + 95 kg N ha- 1. The role and potential of grain legumes as N purveyors have been underestimated in the past by neglecting the N contained in their rhizodeposits...|$|E
30|$|The {{study area}} enjoys a warm {{tropical}} climate with relatively high temperatures {{throughout the year}} and two seasons. Generally, temperatures are high throughout the {{year because of the}} tropical climatic conditions with mean monthly value of about 27  °C, while daily maximum temperatures range between 25 and 30  °C depending on the location and season (Iloeje 1981). The seasonal pattern is characterized by long wet season between mid-March and July which is characterized by heavy rainfall and high humidity followed by a short dry season between July and August and a short wet season (September–October) before the commencement of the dry season in November (Oyenuga 1967; Iloeje 1981). The total annual rainfall decreases from the south to the northern parts of the study area with annual rainfall in the range of 1, 000 – 1, 400  mm. However, about 80  % of the rains fall within the wet months of April–September (Iloeje 1981). Soil types are influenced by and follow very broadly the climatic and vegetational zones of the study area, as the degree of available moisture in the soil {{is an important factor in}} soil reactions, fertility and productivity (Oyenuga 1967). The soils range from that of humid tropical forests zone in the south to that of <b>derived</b> <b>savannah</b> in the north of the study.|$|E

Supplying nutrients to crop as required enforces realization of yield potential of field crop. Field study was carried out between 2009 and 2010 planting seasons to investigate the response of upland rice cultivars to split application of compost at varying growth phases in <b>derived</b> <b>savannah</b> agro-zone. Cattle dung + maize stover compost was applied in two splits of different growth phases (Pre-planting, tillering and panicle exertion, tillering and booting, panicle exertion and booting) to three upland rice cultivars - NERICAI, NERICA II and Ofada. The study was laid out in randomized complete block design with three replicates. Data were collected on growth, dry matter, nutrient uptake concentrations and grain yield. Data were analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and the significant means were compared with Least Significant Difference (LSD) at p = 0. 05. The results showed that compost application at active vegetative periods (Tillering to booting) promoted better LAI (1027. 89), number of leaves (23. 94) and tillers (5. 11). The response of the three upland rice cultivars to varying time of compost application revealed that split application of compost had significant effect on yield components of upland rice cultivars. Uptake concentration of N (11. 49 mg/kg) and P (8. 65 mg/kg) were significantly highest in rice field fertilized at panicle exertion and booting growth...|$|E
40|$|There {{is ample}} {{evidence}} that much of Africa fails to meet basic criteria of agricultural sustainable development and environmental preservation. The objective {{of this study was}} to explore the management of natural resources by self-help farmer cooperatives. The study was carried out in five local government areas of Southwest Nigeria. These local government areas are forest zones covered by <b>derived</b> <b>savannah.</b> The raining season normally starts around April and ends in October/November, followed by a dry season. Agriculture is the main occupation of the people. Several methods were used to collect information. These included group discussions and questionnaires. Results from the study show that women have played a major role in almost every aspect of agriculture. Farmers possess valuable knowledge of the natural resources in their environment. They have made use of changes in soils and topography, which have resulted in planting patterns in the scattered farms around the villages and distant farm plots. With the help of cooperatives, farmers are taught how to develop innovatory regenerative techniques to conserve the tree stock on the farm. These techniques focus around the preservation of forest species. This study has shown that given the opportunity, local farmers can face the environment and tackle the problems when given the required support. farmers, cooperative and natural resources management, Farm Management, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the economics of plantain production in Iwo and Osogbo zones in the <b>derived</b> <b>savannah</b> zone of Osun State, in Nigeria. The objectives were to identify the characteristics of plantain farms, forecast the trend in farm size and analyze the costs and returns to production of plantains in order to determine its performance and how it can be improved. A multistage sampling technique involving purposive and random sampling was used in the study. Primary data collected {{with the aid of a}} structured questionnaire in 2009 on production inputs and output were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Markov chain process and budgetary technique. Descriptive analysis showed that all farms in the study area grew more than one variety of plantain, a majority (72 %) of the farms adopted the recommended spacing of 3 m 2, all the farms were small scale and more than half of them followed the recommended desuckering policy of 4 - 5 plantain suckers per stool. Markov chain analysis showed an upward trend in the sizes of plantain farms in the area of study until the year 2027 when equilibrium would be attained with mean farm size of about 1960. 5 plantain stands. Budgetary analysis results revealed that plantain production was profitable in the zone. The results further showed that the net return accruing to an average plantain farmer was N 65, 781. 67 per ha per annum. In order to improve production of plantain, farmers require to access finance in order to acquire farm inputs, hire labour, and acquire suitable farmland...|$|E
40|$|Maize {{samples were}} {{collected}} during a survey in three agro-ecological zones in Nigeria to determine the distribution and aflatoxin-producing potential of members of Aspergillus section Flavi. The three agro-ecological zones were, <b>Derived</b> <b>Savannah</b> (DS) and Southern Guinea Savannah (SGS) in the humid south and North Guinea Savannah (NGS) in the drier north. Across agro-ecological zones, Aspergillus was the most predominant fungal genera identified followed by Fusarium with mean incidences of 70 and 24 %, respectively. Among Aspergillus, A. flavus was the most predominant and L-strains constituted > 90 % of the species identified, while {{the frequency of the}} unnamed taxon SBG was < 3 %. The incidence of atoxigenic strains of A. flavus was higher in all the districts surveyed except in the Ogbomosho and Mokwa districts in DS and SGS zones, respectively, where frequency of toxigenic strains were significantly (P < 0. 05) higher than that of atoxigenic strains. The highest and lowest incidence of aflatoxin positive samples was recorded in the SGS (72 %) and NGS (20 %), respectively. Aflatoxin contamination in grain also followed a similar trend and the highest mean levels of B-aflatoxins were detected in maize samples obtained from Bida (612 ng g− 1) and Mokwa (169 ng g− 1) districts, respectively, in the SGS. Similarly, the highest concentrations of G-aflatoxins were detected in samples from Akwanga district in the SGS with a mean of 193 and 60 ng g− 1, respectively. When agro-ecological zones were compared, B-aflatoxins were significantly (P < 0. 05) higher in SGS than in NGS, and intermediate in maize samples from the DS agro-ecological zone.

40|$|Abstract: Growth performance, {{haematological}} {{characteristics and}} serum parameters of organically raised broiler chickens were determined in a twelve-week feeding and management trial. Conventional birds (control) and organically raised birds (groups X, Y and Z from which organic millet, sorghum and wheat have been excluded from their diets respectively) were produced in a 2 x 4 factorial arrangement of a completely randomized design (CRD) experiment. One {{hundred and eighty}} days old broiler chicks of Ross breed were randomly allocated to four dietary and management treatments in triplicates of 15 birds per replicate. The conventional birds were raised on deep litters, vaccinated, given mediations and were fed premixes along with the ad libitum diet supply. Organic birds were allowed a three hour foraging daily on experimental quadrants, although they were th th also raised on deep litter system. Data collated were taken at both the 8 and 12 weeks. Results of growth performance, haematological characteristics and serum parameters were significantly different (p< 0. 05) at both th th 8 and 12 weeks, except for haemoglobin and total protein. It was demonstrated that diet, days of slaughter and management practices had significant effects on the growth, haematology and serum parameters of organic broiler chickens. It was concluded that in <b>derived</b> <b>savannah</b> zone Nigeria, safe organic broiler chickens can be produced with diets of CP value of 24. 67 - 27. 24 % and metabolizable energy of between 3002. 45 - 30067. 63 kcal/kg, if allowed outdoor access, forages and exclusion of vaccines and synthetic medications.
