40|$|Provision of an {{adequate}} mineral {{supply in the}} diets of ruminants fed mainly on grassland herbage can present a challenge if mineral concentrations are suboptimal for animal nutrition. <b>Forage</b> <b>herbs</b> may be included in grassland seed mixtures to improve herbage mineral content, although there is limited information about mineral concentrations in <b>forage</b> <b>herbs.</b> To determine whether herbs have greater macro- and micromineral concentrations than forage legumes and grasses, we conducted a 2 -year experiment on a loamy-sand site in Denmark sown with a multi-species mixture comprised of three functional groups (grasses, legumes and herbs). Herb species included chicory (Cichorium intybus L.), plantain (Plantago lanceolata L.), caraway (Carum carvi L.) and salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor L.). We also investigated the effect of slurry application on the macro- and micromineral concentration of grasses, legumes and herbs. In general, herbs had greater concentrations of the macrominerals P, Mg, K and S and the microminerals Zn and B than grasses and legumes. Slurry application indirectly decreased Ca, S, Cu and B concentrations of total herbage because {{of an increase in}} the proportion of mineral-poor grasses. Our study indicates that including herbs in forage mixtures is an effective way of increasing mineral concentrations in herbage...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{located within the}} {{framework}} of research on temperate agricultural grasslands. Plant diversity in temperate agricultural grasslands is impoverished today. Many conventional grasslands in Europe consist of simple grass mixtures, sometimes monocultures. Organic and increasingly conventional grasslands are sown as mixtures of grasses and legumes {{and from time to time}} as multi-species mixtures that include <b>forage</b> <b>herbs.</b> Temporary grasslands are regularly resown or incorporated in a crop rotation and produce ruminant fodder. Some studies indicate that various <b>forage</b> <b>herbs</b> have traits that may complement grass-legume mixtures; among others, increased macro- and micromineral concentration. Hence multi-species grassland mixtures, comprising grasses, legumes and herbs, may have a potential to improve common grasslands consisting of low plant diversity. The legume component of a grass-legume mixture contributes to nitrogen (N) self-sufficiency of the grassland because of its ability for symbiotic N 2 fixation, which allows reduced fertilizer application. Several studies present a positive plant diversityproductivity relationship for temporary European grasslands. Increased soil nutrient use in grasslands with higher plant diversity may be one explanation, where, for example, deep-rooted plant species enable nutrient uptake from deep soil layers. In a state of limbo between ecological hypotheses and agricultural needs, and with the background of limited information on <b>forage</b> <b>herbs</b> and multi-species grassland mixtures, the objective of this Ph. D. study was to quantify the performance of multi-species grassland mixtures in terms of three nutrient processes: 1) mineral accumulation, 2) nitrogen transfer and 3) nitrogen uptake. Three field experiments were conducted in Denmark: two on a loamy-sandy site and one on a sandy-loamy site. The four <b>forage</b> <b>herbs</b> – chicory (Cichorium intybus L.), plantain (Plantago lanceolata L.), salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor L.) and caraway (Carum carvi L.) – grown in a nine-species grass-legume-herb mixture showed in my first field experiment, potential in increasing the macro- and micromineral quality of ruminant fodder derived from grasslands. In a second experiment, legumes, which were confirmed to be the N-richest forage plants of the multi-species mixture, donated N to all nine neighboring plants. Grasses (xFestulolium and Lolium perenne L.) received the largest amount of N among the receiver plants, mainly from white clover (Trifolium repens L.), and slurry application mainly stimulated N transfer from legumes towards grasses. The third experiment confirmed the strong N absorption characteristic of perennial ryegrass when grown in a multispecies mixture. When deep-rooted chicory and lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) were added to a shallow-rooted perennial ryegrass-white clover mixture, total N uptake from three vertical soil layers of this four-species grass-legume-herb mixture did not increase. Chicory, however, took up greater proportions of N from deeper soil layers compared with the other plant species. This study showed that multi-species grassland mixtures have the potential to improve the common simple grass or grass-legume mixtures by reducing the need for external mineral supplementation and by more efficient N use. Yet to use varying plant diversity as a management tool in an agricultural system based on grasslands, more knowledge from grass-legume-herb mixtures to animal performance is needed. Ecologists, agronomists and seed companies may work together to develop improved sustainable grasslands which to a certain extent may mimic natural grasslands...|$|E

However, the mechanisms of salt stress tolerance in A. splendens remain unknown. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies can be used for global gene expression profiling. In this study, we examined sequence and transcript abundance data for the root/leaf transcriptome of A. splendens obtained using an Illumina HiSeq 2500. Over 35 million clean reads were obtained from the leaf and root libraries. All of the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) reads were assembled de novo into a total of 126, 235 unigenes and 36, 511 coding DNA sequences (CDS). We further identified 1663 differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) between the salt stress treatment and control. Functional annotation of the DEGs by gene ontology (GO), using Arabidopsis and rice as references, revealed enrichment of salt stress-related GO categories, including “oxidation reduction”, “transcription factor activity”, and “ion channel transporter”.

From 2009 to 2014, in one of the first long-term and replicated studies of seeding Northern California's Mediterranean annual rangeland, we compared the cover of 22 diverse forages to determine their establishment and survivability over time. Among the annual <b>herbs,</b> <b>forage</b> brassica (Brassica napus L.) and chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) proved viable options. Among the annual grasses, soft brome (Bromus hordeaceus) and annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) performed well. However, these species will likely require frequent reseeding to maintain dominance. Long-term goals of sustained dominant cover (> 3 years) are best achieved with perennial grasses. Perennial grasses that persisted with greater than 50 % cover were Berber orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata), Flecha tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum) and several varieties of hardinggrass (Phalaris aquatica L., Perla koleagrass, Holdfast, Advanced AT).

40|$|To {{enhance our}} {{understanding}} of dietary adaptations and socioecological correlates in colobines, we conducted a 20 -mo study of a wild group of Rhinopithecus bieti (Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys) in the montane Samage Forest. This forest supports a patchwork of evergreen broadleaved, evergreen coniferous, and mixed deciduous broadleaved/coniferous forest assemblages {{with a total of}} 80 tree species in 23 families. The most common plant families by basal area are the predominantly evergreen Pinaceae and Fagaceae, comprising 69 % of the total tree biomass. Previous work has shown that lichens formed a consistent component in the monkeys’ diet year-round (67 %), seasonally complemented with fruits and young leaves. Our study showed that although the majority of the diet was provided by 6 plant genera (Acanthopanax, Sorbus, Acer, Fargesia, Pterocarya, and Cornus), the monkeys fed on 94 plant species and on 150 specific food items. The subjects expressed high selectivity for uncommon angiosperm tree species. The average number of plant species used per month was 16. Dietary diversity varied seasonally, being lowest during the winter and rising dramatically in the spring. The monkeys consumed bamboo shoots in the summer and bamboo leaves throughout the year. The monkeys also <b>foraged</b> on terrestrial <b>herbs</b> and mushrooms, dug up tubers, and consumed the flesh of a mammal (flying squirrel). We also provide a preliminary evaluation of feeding competition in Rhinopithecus bieti and find that the high selectivity for uncommon seasonal plant food items distributed in clumped patches might create the potential for food competition. The finding is corroborated by observations that the subjects occasionally depleted leafy food patches and stayed at a greater distance from neighboring conspecifics while feeding than while resting. Key findings of this work are that Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys have a much more species-rich plant diet than was previously believed and are probably subject to moderate feeding competition...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A lot {{of studies}} have been {{performed}} on demographic changes in ungulate population due to density dependence, but little is done on density dependent changes in foraging behaviour {{which can be a}} mechanism of such demographic changes. This study presents results of density dependency and annual variation (linked to weather) on sheep grazing behaviour over three years and is the first study to experimentally test for density effects on lamb body mass. In a fully replicated, landscape-scale experiment on mountain pastures in southern Norway sheep were grazing at two density levels. Results of the analyses showed annual variation and density-dependence, but the latter always occurred in interaction with other variables. The use of the altitudinal gradient by sheep depended on density and year as well as prevailing weather. A clear sky and high temperatures made the animals to seek to higher elevations especially when resting. This might be an adaptation to avoid insect harassment or to keep an optimal body temperature. There was no effect of density on the selection of vegetation types. Sheep selected meadow first both in 2003 and 2004, while ranking of other vegetation types differed between years. The comparison between low quality (Deschampsia flexuosa) and high quality (<b>herbs)</b> <b>forage</b> showed effects of density, year and age. The use of D. flexuosa varied slightly between years and due to density, while there was a marked effect of age. Ewes ate more grass than lambs did and sheep at high density increased their intake of low quality forage over the season likely due to higher competition. Lambs ate more herbs than ewes in 2003 and 2004 than in 2002 and sheep at low density were able to utilize herbs for a longer time throughout the season. One main result was that lamb body mass showed increased density-dependence from 2002 to 2004. Further, the difference in mass between triplet lambs and singleton lambs was more pronounced at high than at low density. Since triplet lambs growth rates are more sensitive to population density, this suggests monitoring their mass can be used for managing sheep densities on mountain pastures in Norway...|$|R
