5|$|Despite his {{constant}} {{attention to the}} business, the poor supply and insufficient supply of free-labor products proved to be insurmountable, {{making it impossible for}} Coffin to find a replacement to run the company so that he could return to Indiana. The company remained in business primarily through the financial support of wealthy benefactors. Coffin sold the business in 1857, after deciding <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> to maintain a profitable business.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the project}} had neither a budget nor a script. On the former issue, Universal head Lew Wasserman thought the film {{could be made}} for $12 million; the filmmakers wanted $20 million. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> to settle on a {{specific}} amount without a screenplay to review, and after Mitch Glazer declined to help him, Aykroyd wrote one on his own.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before her}} {{scheduled}} Missouri trial date, Kinne's Missouri counsel {{filed a motion}} to change the venue of any eventual fourth trial {{in the death of}} James Kinne, claiming that news coverage of Kinne's cases had so prejudiced residents of Jackson County against her that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> for her to get a fair trial there.|$|E

5|$|As a {{harpsichord}}ist, Pinnock toured Europe {{with the}} Academy of St. Martin in the Fields. While {{a student at}} the RCM, he was told by the registrar, John Stainer, that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> to make a living as a harpsichordist. He made his London debut at the Royal Festival Hall in 1966 with the Galliard Harpsichord Trio, which he co-founded with Stephen Preston, flute, and Anthony Pleeth, cello. At this stage, they were playing baroque music on modern instruments. His solo harpsichord debut was in 1968 at the Purcell Room in London.|$|E
5|$|Hitler's {{motivation}} for authorising Himmler's speeches was {{to ensure that}} all party leaders were made aware of these plans and actions. Thus, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> for them to later deny knowledge of the killings. Because the Allies had indicated {{that they were going to}} pursue criminal charges for German war crimes, Hitler tried to gain the loyalty and silence of his subordinates by making them all parties to the planned genocide.|$|E
5|$|Neither U-10 {{nor any of}} {{her sister}} boats were {{complete}} when World War I began in August 1914. With the boats under construction at Kiel, the Austrians became convinced that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> to take delivery of the boats, which {{would need to be}} towed into the Mediterranean past Gibraltar, a British territory. As a result, U-10 and her four sisters were sold to the Imperial German Navy on 28 November 1914.|$|E

As a result, the five boats of the class were transferred to the Imperial German Navy on 28 November 1914 after the advance payment of 2 million Kronen had been returned. Germaniawerft was then awarded Kriegsauftrag D, hence the type was known as UD.|$|E
5|$|A PPF (production {{possibility}} frontier) typically {{takes the}} form of the curve illustrated above. An economy that is operating on the PPF is said to be efficient, meaning that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> to produce more of one good without decreasing production of the other good. In contrast, if the economy is operating below the curve, it is said to be operating inefficiently because it could reallocate resources in order to produce more of both goods or some resources such as labor or capital are sitting idle and could be fully employed to produce more of both goods.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Jack, {{responding}} to audience research, starts cleaning out green {{clothes from the}} set. He asks Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), {{one of the stars}} of TGS, how old she is, and she tells him that she is 29. As a result of this exchange, Jenna gets botox and collagen injections that go terribly wrong. Later, during a sketch rehearsal—involving impersonations of Condoleezza Rice, Laura Bush, and John Kerry—the various mishaps of Tracy, Jenna, and Josh prompt Liz and Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> for the three to perform on the show. Fortunately, the power in the NBC Studios goes out, canceling the show.|$|E

It's impossible {{for us to do}} that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{remained}} in New York City until March, when the Continental Congress {{sent him to}} South Carolina; the defenses' construction was left to General William Alexander (Lord Stirling). Troops were in limited supply, so Washington found the defenses incomplete, but Lee had concluded that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> to hold the city with the British commanding the sea. He reasoned that the defenses should be located {{with the ability to}} inflict heavy casualties upon the British if any move was made to take and hold ground. Barricades and redoubts were established in and around the city, and the bastion of Fort Stirling across the East River in Brooklyn Heights, facing the city. Lee also saw that the immediate area was cleared of Loyalists.|$|E
5|$|Only 4.46% of the {{recreational}} diving fatalities in a 1997 study were attributable {{to a single}} contributory cause. The remaining fatalities probably arose {{as a result of}} a progressive sequence of events involving two or more procedural errors or equipment failures, and since procedural errors are generally avoidable by a well-trained, intelligent and alert diver, working in an organised structure, and not under excessive stress, it was concluded that the low accident rate in professional scuba diving is due to this factor. The study also concluded that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> to completely eliminate all minor contraindications of scuba diving, as this would result in overwhelming bureaucracy and bring all diving to a halt.|$|E

5|$|The German High Command fully {{expected}} Italy to surrender and, in preparation, had secretly established a new Army group headquarters commanded by Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel at Munich. Rommel would have six divisions {{transferred from the}} Eastern Front, two divisions from France that had just been reformed, and two parachute divisions based in Germany in his new command. However, a Russian offensive in the east prevented the release of all the units promised. Adolf Hitler {{came to the conclusion}} that, without the backing of the Italian Army, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> for the Germans to defend the whole of Italy.|$|E
5|$|U-9 {{was laid}} down on 31 December 1913, {{the third of}} the U-7 boats. Her {{construction}} was slated to be complete within 29 to 33 months. Neither U-9 nor any of her sister boats were complete when World War I began in August 1914. With the boats under construction at Kiel, the Austrians became convinced that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> to take delivery of the boats, which {{would need to be}} towed into the Mediterranean past Gibraltar, a British territory. As a result, U-9 and her four sisters were sold to the Imperial German Navy on 28 November 1914.|$|E
5|$|A {{bigger problem}} was the {{resistance}} of the Shipbuilding Commissariat which said <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> to lay down any ships of new design until about 1950 and that only incremental changes could be made to the designs currently in production. The Navy saw no reason why new ships, reflecting wartime experience, could not be laid down beginning in 1948. To resolve the dispute a special commission was appointed, led by Lavrentiy Beria, which mostly sided with the Shipbuilding Commissariat in that most ships of the program would be improved versions of current designs. Four of the large cruisers were to begin construction, two each at Shipyard 402 in Molotovsk and Shipyard 444 at Nikolayev with another three planned to be laid down in 1953 and 1955. This compromise was approved on 27 November 1945 and detailed design work began in 1946 for designs equipped with both the 220mm and 305mm guns.|$|E

5|$|Famicom's owner, Nintendo, once {{claimed that}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> for their console to be decoded. Using the {{information}} the Ultimate Play the Game team learnt from Rare, the team prepared several tech demos {{and showed them}} to the Nintendo executive Minoru Arakawa in Kyoto. Impressed with their efforts, Nintendo decided to grant the Ultimate Play the Game team an unlimited budget for them to work on games for the Famicom platform. After they returned to England, they moved from Ashby-de-la-Zouch to Twycross, and established a new studio through Rare. They set their headquarters in a Manor Farmhouse. Rare also set up another company known as Rare, Inc., in Miami, Florida. Headed by Joel Hochberg, the American company was involved in maintaining Rare's operation in the US and contacting major US publishers. Famicom was eventually released in the UK under the name Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).|$|E
5|$|Of {{the four}} British {{divisions}} mentioned above, Gillespie's {{was the first}} to penetrate the enemy's frontier. The Nepalese had anticipated that Dehra Dun would be the first place of assault, and had tasked Captain Balbhadra Kunwar with the fortification of the place. When Balbhadra Kunwar, commander of the Nepalese defence army at Dehradun, heard of the approach of the British Army and its size, he realised that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> to defend the city. He withdrew from Dehradun and moved his force of about 600, including dependents, to a hill north-east of the city. He subsequently took up a position in the small fort of Nalapani, Khalanga. His force was ethnically diverse, consisting of Magar soldiers belonging to the Purano Gorakh Battalion and soldiers that had been recruited from Garhwal and nearby areas. On 22 October, before the British declaration of war on 1 November 1814, Gillespie seized the Keree Pass leading into the Dun Valley. He then proceeded to Dehra unchallenged.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnamese {{leadership}} {{expected to}} reach these targets with economic aid from the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) and loans from international agencies of the capitalist world. The 4th National Congress {{made it clear that}} agriculture would be socialised; however, during the Second Five-Year Plan the socialisation measures went so badly that Võ Chí Công, a Politburo member and Chairman of the Committee for the Socialist Transformation of Agriculture, claimed <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> to meet the targets set by the plan by 1980. An estimated 10,000 out of 13,246 socialist cooperatives, established during the plan, had collapsed in the South by 1980. Politburo member Lê Thanh Nghị attacked lower-level cadres for the failure of the socialist agriculture transformation. The collectivisation process led to an abrupt drop in food production in 1977 and 1978, leading the 6th Plenum of the Central Committee to completely overhaul the Party's agricultural policies.|$|E
