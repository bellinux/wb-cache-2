5|$|A team of {{researchers}} discover remains of a crashed spaceship in the Arctic Circle, finding several humanoids with cybernetic implants frozen in the wreckage. Two bodies are taken to a nearby compound to be studied. The scientists marvel at the nanoprobes that begin to repair the long dead aliens. Suddenly one of the seemingly dead subjects attacks the scientists, assimilating them.

5|$|At dawn on 25 March, while {{crossing}} the Tyrrhenian Sea, the French squadron was spotted, having {{been reduced to}} ten ships by a storm the previous night. Ganteaume turned his ships to the south-east and Warren gave chase. Gibraltar and Athenienne began to lag behind, and Warren, fearing his force would become fragmented, ordered his faster ships to slow down. The French were thus able to <b>escape</b> <b>into</b> the night, the British continuing on a south-east course while they quietly turned north, back to Toulon.|$|E

On 14 August, Belfast took part in her first exercise, Operation Hipper, in which she played the role of a German commerce raider attempting to <b>escape</b> <b>into</b> the Atlantic. By navigating the hazardous Pentland Firth, Belfast successfully evaded the Home Fleet.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas where}} the least weasel is {{sympatric}} with the stoat, the two species {{compete with each other}} for rodent prey. The weasel manages to avoid too much competition by living in more upland areas, feeding on smaller prey and being capable of entering smaller holes. It actively avoids encounters with stoats, though female weasels are less likely to stop foraging in the presence of stoats, perhaps because their smaller size allows them to quickly <b>escape</b> <b>into</b> holes.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of October 16, more allied guns were in line and the fire intensified. In desperation, Cornwallis {{attempted}} to evacuate his troops across the York River to Gloucester Point.

Harry sees a vision of Voldemort interrogating and killing the wand-maker Gregorovitch, who claims that a teenage boy had once stolen the legendary Elder Wand from his shop. While Ron is wearing the locket, he is overcome by negative feelings and argues with Harry before leaving him and Hermione behind. Hermione deduces that the sword of Gryffindor can destroy Horcruxes and decides with Harry to go to Godric's Hollow. They visit Harry's parents' graves and the house where they were killed. They encounter Bathilda Bagshot, who they believe may have the sword. Bathilda lets Harry and Hermione into her house, and is revealed to actually be Nagini, controlling Bathilda's reanimated corpse from inside of her. Hermione and Harry <b>escape</b> <b>into</b> the Forest of Dean, but Hermione accidentally breaks Harry's wand whilst fighting Nagini. Hermione is then {{able to identify the}} mysterious thief seen in Harry's vision as Gellert Grindelwald.|$|E

5|$|Large wolf populations {{limit the}} numbers of small to {{medium-sized}} felines. Wolves encounter cougars along portions of the Rocky Mountains and adjacent mountain ranges. Wolves and cougars typically avoid encountering each other by hunting on different elevations. In winter, however, when snow accumulation forces their prey into valleys, interactions between the two species become more likely. Wolves in packs usually dominate cougars and can steal kills. They have been reported killing mothers and their kittens. Wolves hunt steppe cats, and may scavenge from snow leopard kills. Wolves may also reduce Eurasian lynx populations. Wolves may kill lynxes by running them down, or killing them before they can <b>escape</b> <b>into</b> trees. Similar reports of encounters between wolves and bobcats have been documented.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April 1942, 10 Norwegian ships at Gothenburg made {{an attempt}} to <b>escape</b> <b>into</b> Allied-controlled waters, {{where they would be}} met and {{protected}} by a group of British warships. However, Sweden would not allow the Norwegian ships to use their neutral waters for this, and Swedish ships steered the escapees towards waiting German warships. Of the 10, two made it through to the British, six were sunk by the Germans or scuttled by their crew, of which Skytteren was one, two turned back to Gothenburg. Skytteren was scuttled in the waters off Måseskär, Sweden. Her crew were taken as prisoners of war. The wreck of Skytteren remains in those waters, with her bow facing to the west.|$|E

Marshal Georgy Zhukov {{concentrated}} his 1st Belorussian Front, which had been deployed along the Oder river from Frankfurt {{in the south to}} the Baltic, into an area in front of the Seelow Heights. The 2nd Belorussian Front moved into the positions being vacated by the 1st Belorussian Front north of the Seelow Heights. While this redeployment was in progress, gaps were left in the lines; and the remnants of General Dietrich von Saucken's German II Army, which had been bottled up in a pocket near Danzig, managed to <b>escape</b> <b>into</b> the Vistula Delta.
