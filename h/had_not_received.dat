5|$|Back at home, {{the family}} is happy to see Meg, who admits remembering nothing between the {{proposal}} and being in a French hospital. Lois tells Meg that they found Ruth with her tongue cut out. Peter states that he has saved Meg's mail then reveals {{that to be a}} joke as Meg <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> any mail.|$|E
5|$|On May 20, Charles Cornwallis {{arrived at}} Petersburg with 1,500 men after {{suffering}} heavy casualties at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse. He immediately assumed command, as Phillips had recently {{died of a}} fever. Cornwallis <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> permission to abandon the Carolinas from his superior, Henry Clinton, but he believed that Virginia {{would be easier to}} capture, feeling that it would approve of an invading British army.|$|E
5|$|This {{was denied}} by Deutsche Bahn, and the bi-national Channel Tunnel Safety Authority {{confirmed}} that it <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> such an application. The plan was delayed by safety regulations as Deutsche Bahn's fleet of ICE 3M high-speed trains {{could not be}} divided in the tunnel in an emergency.|$|E

5|$|Yuriy Lutsenko {{was fired}} by the Ukrainian Parliament on January 28, 2010. The same day he was {{appointed}} by the Cabinet as first deputy Interior minister and acting Interior Minister. The Kiev District Administrative Court suspended the government's decision {{until the end of}} an investigation into his appointment, but the Cabinet claimed it <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> any court ruling on the matter.|$|E
5|$|As {{the case}} {{expanded}} beyond his jurisdiction, Curto recused {{himself from the}} trial {{and was replaced by}} Javier Beltramone, who released García from prison. Litoral Gas demanded Beltramone's recusal for expressing an opinion about the case to the press. The appeal court agreed in a 2–1 vote to remove Beltramone, and the case was transferred to Patricia Bilotta. García had claimed that he was following instructions received {{in the days before the}} explosion, so Bilotta summoned the technical officers of Litoral Gas to clarify that point. Litoral Gas said that García <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> any instructions prior to the explosion.|$|E
5|$|By mid-July, Maximilian and the Swabian leaders {{suddenly}} {{were under}} pressure from their own troops. In the west, where there lay an army {{under the command of}} count Heinrich von Fürstenberg, a large contingent of mercenaries from Flanders and many knights threatened to leave as they <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> their pay. The foot soldiers of the Swabian troops also complained: most of them were peasants and preferred to go home and bring in the harvest. Maximilian was forced to act.|$|E

5|$|Drusus {{had little}} time to mourn or {{celebrate}} {{the death of his}} grandfather or the ascendance of Tiberius: the legions in the Rhine and Illyricum were in mutiny. They <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> the bonuses promised to them by Augustus, and when it became clear a response from Tiberius was not forthcoming, they revolted. On 17 or 18 September, Drusus was sent to deal with the troops in Illyricum, and a delegation was sent to confer proconsular imperium maius upon Germanicus, who dealt with the situation on the Rhine. Drusus did not require proconsular powers because he was consul designate.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, American guitarist Ry Cooder {{had been}} invited to Havana by British world music {{producer}} Nick Gold of World Circuit Records to record a session in which African musicians from Mali were to collaborate with Cuban musicians. On Cooder's arrival (via Mexico to avoid the ongoing U.S. trade and travel embargo against Cuba), it transpired that the musicians from Mali <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> their visas and were unable to travel to Havana. Cooder and Gold changed their plans and decided to record an album of Cuban son music with local musicians.|$|E
5|$|In middle school, Seo was {{the student}} class {{president}} and {{was offered the}} opportunity to attend an entrance competition for the Sunhwa Arts School. She had been dancing for six months but <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> any formal ballet training. She entered into the competition and was awarded a scholarship to attend the Sunhwa. Initially her parents were against her leaving due to her young age but were persuaded otherwise by one of her teachers. Seo enrolled for one year before leaving to study ballet in a professional training program in the United States.|$|E

5|$|More {{was indicted}} by the Grand Inquest for the County of Washington, during its July term, for taking {{unlawful}} fees {{for his services}} as a justice of the peace. The indictment charged More with having taken the fees on July 17 and 24. A capias, returnable at the December 1802 term, was issued. The members of the Inquest included five other D.C. justices of the peace: Daniel Carrol, Daniel Reintzell, Joseph Sprigg Belt, Thomas Corcoran, and Anthony Reintzell. Another member of the Inquest was Thomas Beall, a confirmed Adams appointee who <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> a commission from Jefferson.|$|E
5|$|Sanders, a bachelor, died without {{knowledge}} of the award of a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his actions on 12 June 1917. The emergence of correspondence with his first Q-ship commander, A.D Blair, {{makes it clear that}} he at least knew of his VC prior to his death, even if he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> it. In June 1918, Sanders' father received his son's VC and DSO from the Governor-General of New Zealand. Sander's VC, the only one awarded to a New Zealander serving in the navy, and DSO are on display at the Auckland War Memorial Museum.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} made Rogers {{a national}} hero, but {{his brother was}} killed and Rogers was badly wounded in fights in the Pacific. On his return, he was successfully sued by his crew {{on the grounds that}} they <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> their fair share of the expedition profits, and Rogers was forced into bankruptcy. He wrote of his maritime experiences in the book A Cruising Voyage Round the World, which sold well, in part due to public fascination at Selkirk's rescue.|$|E

5|$|The federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration was {{requested}} {{to provide all}} records regarding the internal inspection of Line 901 conducted in 2012 and details of all other inspections since 2013 such as maintenance data, monitoring information, incident reports and repair logs. The Environmental Defense Center of Santa Barbara (EDC), who had requested {{the release of the}} records along with the Santa Barbara Channelkeepers, filed a lawsuit against the agency in December 2015 since it had been over six months and they <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> any of the requested documents.|$|E
5|$|The games {{received}} generally favorable reviews. Most critics {{praised the}} addition of Wi-Fi features and felt that the gameplay, though it <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> much updating from previous games, was still engaging. Reviewers were divided on the graphics, however, and the audio was criticized as being primitive. The games enjoyed more commercial success than their Game Boy Advance predecessors: with around 18 million units sold worldwide, Diamond and Pearl have sold over 2 million more units than Ruby and Sapphire and almost 6 million more units than FireRed and LeafGreen, while outselling their successors, Black and White, by over 2 million copies.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{argued that}} Bamber <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> {{a telephone call}} from his father, that Nevill was too badly injured after the first shots to have spoken to anyone, that there was no blood on the kitchen phone that had been left off the hook, and that Nevill would have called the police before calling Bamber. They also argued that, had Bamber really received such a call, he would have dialled 999, alerted the farm workers, then made his way quickly there himself.|$|E

5|$|The {{report of}} the journey, which {{included}} sharp criticism of the governor of Saratov, was not well received at court. The Forsters claimed they <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> fair payment for their work and had to move house. They chose to settle in England in 1766. The father took up teaching at the Dissenter's Academy in Warrington and also translation work. At the age of only thirteen, the young Forster published his first book: an English translation of Lomonosov's history of Russia, which was well received in scientific circles.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks before}} her mother's death in 1967, 16-year-old Jayne Marie accused Sam Brody, her mother's boyfriend at that time, of beating her. The girl's {{statement}} to {{officers of the}} Los Angeles Police Department the following morning implicated her mother in encouraging the abuse, and days later a juvenile court judge awarded temporary custody of Jayne Marie to Paul's uncle William W. Pigue and his wife Mary. Following her 18th birthday, Jayne Marie complained that she <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> her inheritance from the Mansfield estate or heard from her father since her mother's death.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after his}} inauguration, Jefferson {{instructed}} his Secretary of State, James Madison, to stop delivery on all outstanding commissions. Further, {{an act of}} March 8, 1802 the abolished the circuit court judgeships created by the Midnight Judges Act (15 of which had already been filled), restoring the system created under the 1789 and 1793 acts. Federalists viewed this as unconstitutional and looked to the then-pending case of Marbury v. Madisonconcerning a confirmed D.C. {{justice of the peace}} who <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> his commissionas a test case for the constitutionality of the repeal. The next session of the Supreme Court was in June, one month before the repeal would take effect. But, the Judiciary Act of 1802 delayed the Court's next session until February 1803, and made other changes to the structure of the judicial system.|$|E
