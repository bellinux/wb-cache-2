40|$|The {{production}} function {{approach has been}} one of the two main ex-post procedures used to estimate the rate of return to agricultural research. A critical part of estimating the marginal internal rate of return (MIRR) is the procedure adopted to spread the benefits of research through time. Past studies using this approach have given only brief consideration to this <b>computational</b> <b>procedure.</b> The objective in this study was to review the different <b>computational</b> <b>procedures</b> used and, then, using cross-section {{production function}} estimates for U.

40|$|International audienceThe thermal {{resistance}} of an interface between two materials, conceptualized by Kapitza, {{is an important}} physical phenomenon encountered in many situations of practical interest. The numerical treatment of this phenomenon has up to now run into difficulties due to the temperature discontinuity. In this work, a general and efficient <b>computational</b> <b>procedure</b> for modelling the Kapitza {{thermal resistance}} is proposed, {{which is based on}} the extended finite element method (XFEM) in tandem with a level-set method. The steady thermal conduction in a two-phase material with the Kapitza thermal resistance at the interface is first formulated in a variational way and then numerically treated with the proposed <b>computational</b> <b>procedure.</b> Different three-dimensional numerical examples with known analytical solutions show the high accuracy and robustness of the proposed <b>computational</b> <b>procedure</b> in capturing the temperature jump across an interface...|$|R

40|$|The time-optimal control {{functions}} for sample control systems were computed using the iterative <b>computational</b> <b>procedure</b> proposed by L. W.

Adaptation for differential analyzer solution required that finite sized steps be taken during the ascent vice the infinitely small sized steps permissible in theory. This presented {{one of the problems}} of the <b>computational</b> <b>procedure.</b> No optimization of the step size was attempted in this work, however, several criteria for the selection of the step size were used with success on the two-dimensional systems. The optimal control {{functions for}} two-dimensional systems were readily computed using Neustadt' s iterative <b>computational</b> <b>procedure.</b> Analytic work was performed to verify some computer solutions. Agreement of computer and analytic solutions was favorable. The optimal control function for the three-dimensional system investigated was not obtained.
