5|$|The Weather Bureau {{had issued}} {{the first of}} its twice-daily reports at {{approximately}} 8:00a.m.; it did not send another report to Washington, D.C. until 8:00p.m. This proved to be a serious problem: the storm would have {{the better part of a}} day to build up hurricane forces before the Bureau <b>headquarters</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C., would have detailed information.|$|E

5|$|Until 1864, {{communications}} between Fort Greble {{and its neighbors}} had to be routed through departmental <b>headquarters</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington.</b> After {{a test of the}} system completely failed, efforts were made to establish signaling points between the forts, and the forts themselves were connected to Washington via telegraph wire. Signal detachments were present at Fort Stanton, near Uniontown, and sometimes visited Fort Greble as part of training efforts.|$|E
5|$|Early on September14, {{the storm}} {{weakened}} to a tropical depression. It weakened slowly while moving northeastward across the Deep South, before dissipating near Athens, Georgia on September15. Operationally, {{it was considered}} the third tropical cyclone of the season. A telegraph from the Weather Bureau <b>headquarters</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C. warned vessels to remain in port for portions of the Gulf Coast of the United States. Strong gales were experienced along the coast from eastern Louisiana to western Florida and severely disrupted telegraph services in the region. The remnants brought heavy rains from Virginia to New England. Rough seas {{along the coast of}} New Jersey washed the schooner Willie ashore.|$|E

5|$|On 1 January 1944, the Army {{decentralized}} counterintelligence to {{the service}} commands. Lansdale attempted to have his group exempted from this, but when he failed, Groves had Lansdale's unit reassigned to the Manhattan Project, creating a new Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) unit within the Project. Groves had Lansdale transferred to the Manhattan District, but instead of placing him {{in charge of the}} new CIC unit, Groves made Lansdale his special assistant for security at Manhattan Project <b>headquarters</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C.

5|$|After the ASTP {{mission was}} completed, Lunney became {{manager of the}} Shuttle Payload Integration and Development Program. During this period, it was {{anticipated}} that NASA's space shuttle fleet would be flying very frequent missions, and carrying commercial payloads as well as flying missions for government {{organizations such as the}} Department of Defense and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The payload integration program was responsible for determining how the various demands of these customers could be satisfied, and how mixed payloads could best be physically accommodated within the cargo bay of the shuttle. During these years Lunney also spent time working at NASA <b>Headquarters</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C., as Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Flight and later as Acting Associate Administrator for Space Transportation Operations.|$|E

5|$|At 9:42a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{grounded}} all civilian aircraft {{within the}} continental U.S., and civilian aircraft already in flight {{were told to}} land immediately. All international civilian aircraft were either turned back or redirected to airports in Canada or Mexico, and were banned from landing on United States territory for three days. The attacks created widespread confusion among news organizations and air traffic controllers. Among the unconfirmed and often contradictory news reports aired throughout the day, {{one of the most}} prevalent said a car bomb had been detonated at the U.S. State Department's <b>headquarters</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C. Another jet—Delta Air Lines Flight 1989—was suspected of having been hijacked, but the aircraft responded to controllers and landed safely in Cleveland, Ohio.|$|E

Deciding to thank Limbaugh for his newfound conservatism, Brian is taken by Limbaugh to the National Republican Party <b>headquarters</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C., in order to meet former President of the United States George W. Bush and United States Senator John McCain from Arizona. McCain then recalls when he and Limbaugh solved mysteries together. A parody of the animated television series Scooby-Doo is then shown, including McCain and Limbaugh capturing United States Congressman Barney Frank from Massachusetts, disguised as a mummy.|$|E
5|$|B-29s {{began to}} arrive over Yawata at 00:38 local {{time and the}} attack on the city lasted almost two hours. Only 15 of the American {{aircraft}} were able to aim their bombs visually as the city was blacked out and obscured by smoke or haze; the other 32 bombed by radar. Two further B-29s bombed Laoyao harbor and another five struck targets of opportunity; overall 107 tons of bombs were dropped during the raid. After the first bombs were released regular updates on the operation were transmitted to the Twentieth Air Force's <b>headquarters</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> from where they were relayed to Arnold who was in London at the time. The raiders were met with heavy but inaccurate anti-aircraft fire and the searchlights stationed around Yawata were not effective. The 4th Air Regiment achieved the only kill of the night when one of its fighters shot down a B-29. The Regiment's other aircraft struggled to make contact with the bombers and achieved few interceptions.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle was}} a {{disaster}} for the Japanese. Out of 6,900 troops who were badly needed in New Guinea, only about 1,200 made it to Lae. Another 2,700 were saved by destroyers and submarines and returned to Rabaul. About 2,890 Japanese soldiers and sailors were killed. The Allies lost 13 aircrew, 10 of whom were lost in combat while three others died in an accident. There were also eight wounded. Aircraft losses were one B-17 and three P-38s in combat, and one B-25 and one Beaufighter in accidents. MacArthur issued a communiqué on 7 March claiming that 22 ships, including 12 transports, three cruisers and seven destroyers, had been sunk along with 12,792 troops. Army Air Force <b>Headquarters</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C. looked into the matter in mid-1943 and concluded that there were only 16 ships involved, but GHQ SWPA elected to stick to its original story.
