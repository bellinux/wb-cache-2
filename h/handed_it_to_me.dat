25|$|You may be {{too young}} to remember, but in 1971, during a Test match, I {{collided}} with England fast bowler John Snow and lost my bat. Snow {{picked it up and}} <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> But at the time, many papers wrote that Snow had flung the bat at me. It all depends on your point of view, or what you are trying to portray...|$|E
2500|$|One {{afternoon}} of November, 1868, in the Park at Hawarden, I {{was standing by}} Mr. Gladstone holding his coat on my arm while he, in his shirt sleeves, was wielding an axe to cut down a tree. Up came a telegraph messenger. He took the telegram, opened it and read it, then <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> speaking only two words, namely, 'Very significant', and at once resumed his work. The message merely stated that General Grey would arrive that evening from Windsor. [...] This, of course, implied that a mandate {{was coming from the}} Queen charging Mr. Gladstone with the formation of his first Government. [...] I said nothing, but waited while the well-directed blows resounded in regular cadence. [...] After a few minutes the blows ceased and Mr. Gladstone, resting on the handle of his axe, looked up, and with deep earnestness in his voice, and great intensity in his face, exclaimed: My mission is to pacify Ireland. He then resumed his task, and never said another word till the tree was down.|$|E
2500|$|According to his {{acceptance}} speech for the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1998, Ron's interest in writing mathematics textbooks started the summer after his sophomore year in college. [...] "In my sophomore year I decided to switch to math. I wasn't prepared for it. I had forgotten my high school algebra and trig, and I had to spend my sophomore year taking those courses over again. After I was accepted to Lewis & Clark, I made an appointment {{to talk with the}} math department chair, Elvy Fredrickson. That was in June 1964. I asked Elvy if she would let me squeeze four years of math into my junior and senior years at Lewis & Clark. To imagine her thoughts, {{you have to remember that}} I had not even taken a course in freshman calculus. I didn't then know what Elvy was thinking. I only knew what she said and what she did. She went to a bookshelf in her office in the old math building, scanned the titles, took down a calculus text, <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and said, 'Study this book during the summer. The week before classes start in the fall, I will give you a test. If you pass, I will let you take your sophomore and junior mathematics courses concurrently. By the time you reach your senior year, you will be on track.' [...] Years later, Elvy told me that she had no idea I would actually do it. But, I had no idea that she had no ideaand so I took her up on her offer. I read the calculus book, passed the test, and started taking third-semester calculus and linear algebra in the fall of 1964." ...|$|E

"Well you gotta say something, Saxon. <b>Hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> good or bad; {{but anyway}} <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> An' just take into {{consideration}} that I love you. Why, I love you like the very devil, Saxon. I must, because I'm askin' you <b>to</b> marry <b>me,</b> an' I never asked any girl that before." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I don't believe I {{read that}} section of the {{newspaper}} on the floor there by your foot. Would you <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> please?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it is here," [...] she said, quickly, {{taking it}} out of the folds of a light shawl which covered her shoulders--the gift of Jessie--and <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{wrote on}} a sheet of his notebook, and, tearing it out, <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then with a self-satisfied smirk he half-cocked {{the rifle}} and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> ready for action.|$|E
60|$|He {{opened the}} letter, and marking a certain passage {{in it with}} a pencil, <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Fling it at him," [...] {{suggested}} Bumpus, getting cautiously up. [...] "Here, <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I've seed a heavy horse-pistol {{like that}} do great execution when well aimed by a stout arm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Else what," [...] he asked, [...] "would {{make him}} <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> so solemn-like, and tell <b>me</b> <b>to</b> pass <b>it</b> on <b>to</b> her {{if he was}} drowned? I didna think o' that at the time, but <b>it</b> has come <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> Gavinia; <b>it</b> has come." ...|$|R
60|$|Having perfected his arrangements, {{he would}} get my pipe, and, {{lighting}} <b>it,</b> would <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Often he was obliged to strike a light for the occasion; and as the mode he adopted was entirely different from what I had ever seen or heard of before, I will describe it.|$|R
60|$|He drew a {{card from}} his pocket, and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I read it with ill-concealed curiosity.|$|E
60|$|He <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and I tore it open. It {{contained}} {{only a few}} lines, in a large sprawling hand-writing.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{handed him}} both. After several futile efforts {{he succeeded in}} writing a few words. Then he folded up the note, and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, I'll let you go. When {{you return}} we'll see about the college." [...] Then he {{surprised}} me by drawing {{a letter from}} his pocket and <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "My friend, Mr. White, got this letter from the department at Washington. It may be of use to you out there." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{ran away}} from me, taking the path which would lead her home again. The deaf man and I were left together. He looked after her until {{she was out of}} sight. Then he {{produced}} his book of blank leaves. But, instead of <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as usual, he began <b>to</b> write in <b>it</b> himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not {{completely}} gather your meaning," [...] he said. [...] "I fear I must ask you <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> with still more breezy frankness. Do you speak from purely friendly motives? Are you advising <b>me</b> <b>to</b> discontinue the series because you {{fear that it}} will damage the literary reputation of the paper? Do you speak solely as a literary connoisseur? Or are there other reasons?" ...|$|R
6000|$|When Mr. Selby {{had read}} the {{telegram}} from Sir John he <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> saying, [...] "It is only fair that you should see this." ...|$|E
6000|$|He <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> It was so remarkably humorous and short, that I {{remember}} {{every word}} of it at this distance of time. It began in this way: ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and I tore it open as I {{stepped on}} to the pavement. It was written from Feltham Court, Norfolk, and dated the {{previous}} day.|$|E
60|$|When {{we reached}} Cologne, the Cantankerous Old Lady {{overwhelmed}} {{me with the}} warmth of her thanks and praises. Nay, more; after breakfast next morning, before we set out by slow train for Schlangenbad, she burst like a tornado into my bedroom at the Cologne hotel with a cheque for twenty guineas, drawn in my favour. 'That's for you, my dear,' she said, <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and looking really quite gracious.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here it is," [...] said Banker, {{drawing the}} letter he had {{prepared}} from his pocket, and {{holding it in}} such a position that she could read the address. [...] "You see, it is marked, 'by private hand,' and this is the private hand that has brought <b>it</b> <b>to</b> you. Now, if you will count out the money, and will <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I will give you the letter. That is perfectly fair, isn't it?" ...|$|R
60|$|She read <b>it,</b> and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> back <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{without a}} word. We were all {{watching}} her eagerly. She {{looked at me}} appealingly.|$|R
60|$|Jones and I toiled laboriously upward. He {{had brought}} my lasso, and he <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> with the {{significant}} remark that I would soon have need of it.|$|E
60|$|With that reply {{she opened}} the note. Her face flushed deeply while she read it--her eyes brightened with anger as she <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to read in my turn.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was with}} Mr. Cole on {{business}} {{an hour and}} a half ago. He had just read Elton's letter as I was shewn in, and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> directly." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Hudson had {{appeared}} with a lady's card upon her salver. Holmes glanced at it, raised his eyebrows, and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> over <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|Poor Lady Verinder (reclining thoughtlessly {{on her own}} sofa cushions) {{glanced at}} the book, and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> back <b>to</b> <b>me</b> looking more {{confused}} than ever.|$|R
60|$|His {{face grew}} a shade paler as he glanced it through. Then he folded <b>it</b> up and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> back <b>to</b> <b>me</b> with a polite gesture.|$|R
6000|$|My visitor fumbled in his raiment, drew forth a soiled card, and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Upon it was written, {{in plain}} but unsteadily formed characters, the name [...] "Michob Ader." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{jumped up}} {{in a state}} of ecstasy. Just as I had thrown my arms round Mrs. Staveley's neck, the servant came in with a letter, and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|He dived {{into his}} breast-pocket, became {{motionless}} for ten seconds, then woke {{up again and}} produced her letter. He drew it clumsily from its envelope, and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> silently.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We took a drive yesterday,' Linda said; <b>'and</b> <b>it</b> seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that <b>it</b> is {{the worst}} smelling and most {{unhealthy}} sort of place I was ever in.' ...|$|R
60|$|I walked {{towards him}} serenely {{confident}} that he would <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> over <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and that all was for {{the best in the}} best of all possible worlds.|$|R
6000|$|She {{sank into}} a chair beyond the table and {{stretched}} a <b>hand</b> across <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> inviting the clasp of mine. [...] "But if this is so, why leave us?" ...|$|R
