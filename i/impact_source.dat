40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Journal of Strategic Information Systems and the definitive published version is available at [URL] sourcing – the practice of bringing digitally-enabled outsourcing jobs to marginalized individuals – is an important emerging social innovation in the outsourcing industry. The <b>impact</b> <b>sourcing</b> model of delivering Information Technology and Business Process Outsourcing (IT–BPO) services not only seeks to deliver business value for clients, but is also driven by an explicit social mission to help marginalized communities enjoy the benefits of globalization. This dual focus {{has led to the}} ambitious claim that social value creation can be integral to (and not always by-products of) innovative IT–BPO models. Given the relative newness of the <b>impact</b> <b>sourcing</b> business model there is scarce research about how <b>impact</b> <b>sourcing</b> companies emerge and the process through which entrepreneurs build and operate such companies. This paper draws on a qualitative study of seven Indian <b>impact</b> <b>sourcing</b> companies and develops a process model of the individual-level motivational triggers of <b>impact</b> <b>sourcing</b> entrepreneurship, the entrepreneurial actions underpinning different phases of venture creation and the positive institutional-level influences on <b>impact</b> <b>sourcing.</b> The paper argues that since deeply personalized values are central to the creation and development of <b>impact</b> <b>sourcing</b> companies, the business model may not be easy to replicate. The analysis highlights an intensive period of embedding and robust alliances with local partners as crucial for the scalability and sustainability of the <b>impact</b> <b>sourcing</b> business model.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the use of}} four embedded fiber optic acoustic emission sensors (FOAESs) to identify the <b>impact</b> <b>source</b> of the carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) plate. The optical waveguide method and computer simulation were both applied to explain the principle of FOAES, which proved that {{any one of the}} two output terminals of FOAES was able to reveal frequency response characteristics of stress waves. The response characteristics of the FOAES to the stress waves were calibrated and discussed for comparisons of before-and-after embedded in the CFRP plate.

40|$|International audiencePrevious {{research}} on the standard tapping machine {{has shown that the}} impact on a floor depends strongly on the combined system of floor and tapping hammers.

Conversion from one <b>impact</b> <b>source</b> to another has to be made for each floor individually, provided there is a sufficient knowledge of the dynamic properties of the source and floor. So, if the standard tapping machine is to be used to characterise a floor with respect to walking noise, the only simple way out of the problem is to make it 'behave like a walker'. That means it should have the same source impedance. Investigations at the Fraunhofer-Institut für Bauphysik Stuttgart showed that this could be achieved by small modifications to the standard tapping machine.

40|$|Abstract. A {{technique}} to localize an <b>impact</b> <b>source</b> for an elastic spherical shell is proposed. The conventional source localization techniques when the source {{is located on}} a dispersive medium, require both the time-of-arrival differences (TOADs) between the transducer signals and the group velocities. In practice, the material properties or the geometry of the medium are not fully informed, therefore the group velocity is not available. Furthermore, they are only applicable {{if we have a}} high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we propose a method that can be applicable in practice, which does not need to know the group velocity, when we have a relatively small SNR. The scanning procedure over the structure to acquire a minimum variance point of the estimated group velocities is suggested. To reduce the noise effect, an exponential function is asymmetrically weighted in smoothed Wigner-Ville distributions (WVDs). Experiments have been conducted to confirm the validity of this method. As a result, the proposed technique is found to be effective for an <b>impact</b> <b>source</b> localization for a spherical shell without prior information on the group velocity, even in a noisy environment...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT VLSI Implementation of Digital Circuits by OPINDER SHARMA May 2011 Advisor: 	Dr. Harpreet Singh Major: 	Computer Engineering Degree:	Master of Science Digital design {{circuits}} have {{applications in}} many fields, {{such as the}} communication, automotive and entertainment industries. The applications of digital circuits are becoming increasingly frequent in daily use such as computers, cell phones, televisions and remote control devices, etc. Consequently, a need arises to have a procedure to design chips from the digital circuits. There {{are a number of}} softwares, which are currently used for designing a chip from the digital circuits. Verilog and VHDL are a hardware description languages, which have attracted the attention {{of a large number of}} digital designers. In this thesis, unformed procedures to use different software for FPGA implementation and chip designing are developed. These procedures are discussed using real time applications, which are <b>impact</b> <b>source</b> determination and crack detection. The problem of crack detection is important in the army, aircraft and automotive industries. In this type of problem, there is an increasing interest in finding out the source for the determination of the crack. We are interested in determining the source of impact. The idea of <b>impact</b> <b>source</b> determination is to identify the source from which the impact originates. There are various algorithms to determine the source of impact and crack detection. In this thesis, we have suggested a fuzzy logic approach for the determination of the source of impact and crack detection. This thesis also suggests a procedure to develop a chip for <b>impact</b> <b>source</b> determination and crack detection. It is hoped that such an <b>impact</b> <b>source</b> determination chip will be useful in the hand-held devices. This thesis also proposes the development of a chip for the password protected system. The password protected system is used to stop the unauthorized access to any vehicle or building. Unauthorized access is a big concern for the army and automotive industries. Consequently, there is a great need for the password-protected system. That system can be installed in vehicles and buildings to stop unlawful activities. The password-protected system uses the network with the base station to give the access to vehicles and buildings. This thesis also proposes a procedure for the FPGA implementation for the password protected system. The approach used is to write a program in hardware description language (using HLSM) which can be used for the FPGA implementation. It is hoped that these techniques will helps in the development of new chips for a large number of application...|$|E

Prior to impact monitoring, the plate is calibrated (or characterized) by transfer functions at discrete locations on the plate surface. Both impact location and impact loading time-history are identified using T-R technique and associated signal processing algorithms. Numerical verification for finite-size isotropic plates under low velocity impacts is performed to demonstrate the versatility of T-R method for <b>impact</b> <b>source</b> identification. The tradeoff between accuracy of the impact location detection and calibration spacing is studied in detail. In particular, the effect of plate thickness on calibration spacing has been examined. A number of parameters selected for determining the impact location, approximated transfer functions and steps taken for reconstructing the impact loading time-history are also examined. Two types of noise with various intensities contaminated in strain response and/or transfer functions are investigated for demonstrating the stability and reliability of the T-R method. The results show that T-R method is robust against noise in impact location detection and force reconstruction in circumventing the inherent ill-conditioned inverse problem.

40|$|This article {{presents}} an in situ imaging method {{able to detect}} in real-time the <b>impact</b> <b>source</b> location in reverberant complex composite structures using only one passive sensor. This technique {{is based on the}} time reversal acoustic method applied to a number of waveforms stored in a database containing the impulse response (Green's function) of the structure. The proposed method allows achieving the optimal focalization of the acoustic emission source in the time and spatial domain as it overcomes the drawbacks of other ultrasonic techniques. This is mainly due to the dispersive nature of guided Lamb waves as well as the presence of multiple scattering and mode conversion that can degrade the quality of the focusing, causing poor localization. Conversely, using the benefits of a diffuse wave field, the imaging of the source location can be obtained through a virtual time reversal procedure, which does not require any iterative algorithms and a priori knowledge of the mechanical properties and the anisotropic group speed. The efficiency of this method is experimentally demonstrated on a stiffened composite panel.

Floor vibrations induced by human walking were analysed using peak acceleration, root-mean-square (r. m. s.) acceleration, and the vibration dose value (VDV), with four frequency weighting functions (Wb, Wk, Wg, and Wm). Significant differences in the measured floor vibrations were found across the floor structures with greater floor vibration leading to greater perceived vibration intensity, lower acceptability, and lower serviceability. The VDV was correlated with perceptions of floor vibration when used with all four frequency weighting functions.
