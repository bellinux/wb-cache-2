2500|$|<b>Estoppel</b> <b>by</b> {{convention}} as {{understood in}} English law (also known as <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> agreement) occurs where two parties negotiates or operates a contract {{based on a}} shared assumption or mutual understanding of a legal effect (or interpretation) of that contract, they are bound by that belief, assumption or understanding if (i) they both knew the other operated under the same, and (ii) they both regulated their subsequent dealings on the same.

50|$|Legal {{estoppel}} is {{a principle}} of law, particularly United States patent law, that an assignor or grantor is not permitted subsequently to deny the validity of title to {{the subject matter of}} the assignment or grant. Originally {{a principle of}} real property law, applicable to deeds of land and called <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> <b>deed,</b> the Supreme Court extended legal estoppel to patents in Westinghouse Elec. & Mfg. Co. v. Formica Insulation Co.|$|E
50|$|There {{seems to}} be no reason why the {{principles}} of <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> <b>deed</b> should not apply to assignment of a patent right….The grantor purports to convey the right to exclude others, in the one instance, from a defined tract of land, and in the other, from a described and limited field of the useful arts. The difference between the two cases is only the practical one of fixing exactly what is the subject matter conveyed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Estoppel</b> <b>by</b> <b>deed</b> is {{a rule of}} {{evidence}} arising from {{the status of a}} contract signed under seal—such agreements, called deeds, are more strictly enforced than ordinary contracts and the parties are expected to take greater care to verify the contents before signing them. Hence, once signed, all statements of fact (usually found in the opening recital which sets out the reason(s) for making the deed) are conclusive evidence against the parties who are estopped from asserting otherwise.|$|E

50|$|British Leyland Motor Corp. v Armstrong Patents Co. is a 1986 {{decision}} of the House of Lords concerning the doctrine of non-derogation from grants. This doctrine is comparable to, but somewhat broader than, the doctrine of legal estoppel, assignor estoppel, or <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> <b>deed</b> in U.S. law. Under the doctrine of non-derogation from grants, a seller of realty or (after this decision) goods is not permitted to take any action (such as bringing an infringement action) that would lessen the value to the buyer of the thing sold.|$|E
50|$|Estoppel is {{a common}} law {{doctrine}} which, when it applies, prevents a litigant from denying {{the truth of what}} was said or done. The doctrine of <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> <b>deed</b> (also known as after-acquired title) is a particular estoppel doctrine in the context of real property transfers. Under the doctrine, the grantor of a deed (generally the seller of a piece of real property) is estopped (barred) from denying the truth of the deed. The doctrine may only be invoked in a suit arising out of the deed, or involving a particular right arising out of the deed.|$|E

5000|$|The {{status of}} <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> {{representation}} of fact is less clear in Australia. Two seminal decisions purport to fuse common law and equitable estoppels into a single unified doctrine, but the New South Wales Court of Appeal continues to treat <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> representation at common law as distinct from equitable estoppel. [...] This can be significant in deciding which court has jurisdiction to adjudicate on the issue.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Estoppel</b> <b>by</b> {{representation}} of fact and promissory estoppel are mutually exclusive: [...] the former is based on {{representation of}} existing fact (or of mixed fact and law), while the latter {{is based on a}} promise not to enforce some pre-existing right (i.e., an intention as to the future).

50|$|It is {{debatable}} whether <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> convention {{is a separate}} estoppel doctrine, or merely a case of reliance-based <b>estoppel</b> (<b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> representation would be its most frequent form), or {{of the rule of}} interpretation that, where words in a contract are ambiguous, one always interprets those words so as to give effect to the actual intentions of the parties even if that would not be the usual legal outcome (see Amalgamated Investment and Property Co.

50|$|A {{representation}} {{can be made}} by statement or conduct. Although {{the representation}} must be clear and unambiguous, a representation can be inferred from silence where there is a duty to speak or from negligence where a duty of care arises. Under English law, <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> representation of fact is not a cause of action, though it may be a defence or acts in support of a cause of action. There is some debate whether under English law courts will take into account unconscionability under <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> representation of fact, although Australian courts clearly do.|$|R
50|$|The {{common law}} {{doctrine}} of <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> acquiescence is applied when one party gives legal notice {{to a second}} party of a fact or claim, and the second party fails to challenge or refute that claim within a reasonable time. The second party {{is said to have}} acquiesced to the claim, and is estopped from later challenging it, or making a counterclaim. The doctrine is different from <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> laches to the extent that a lache may be involuntary but acquiescence involves an intentional act of the party who is accused of aquiescence.|$|R

2500|$|Under English law, <b>estoppel</b> <b>by,</b> {{promissory}} <b>estoppel</b> and {{proprietary estoppel}} {{are regarded as}} reliance-based <b>estoppels</b> <b>by</b> Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol 16(2), 2003. [...] Both Halsbury's and Spencer Bower (see below) describe all three estoppels collectively as <b>estoppels</b> <b>by</b> representation. [...] These estoppels can be invoked when a promisee/representee wishes to enforce a promise/representation when no consideration was provided by him. [...] The court will only enforce this lack-of-consideration promise {{if and only if}} it would be [...] "unconscionable" [...] for the promisor/representor to rescind from his promise/representation ("it's not fair!"). [...] Estoppel when invoked in such a manner is often considered a rival or alternative to the doctrine of consideration under contract law. [...] Only proprietary estoppel can create a cause of action in English law, though the other two can act in support of a cause of action or a reply to a defence. [...] Under American jurisprudence, equitable estoppel is available only as a defense, while promissory estoppel can be used as the basis of a cause of action.|$|R
