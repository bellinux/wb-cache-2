British lesbians followed with the publication of Arena Three beginning in 1964, with a similar mission.|$|E
5|$|The spotted {{green pigeon}} or Liverpool pigeon (Caloenas maculata) is {{a species of}} pigeon which is most likely extinct. It was first {{mentioned}} and described in 1783 by John Latham, who had seen two specimens of unknown provenance and a drawing depicting the bird. The taxonomic relationships of the bird were long obscure, and early writers suggested many different possibilities, though the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> related to the Nicobar pigeon (C. nicobarica) prevailed, and it was therefore placed in the same genus, Caloenas. Today, the species is only known from a specimen kept in World Museum, Liverpool. Overlooked {{for much of the}} 20th century, it was recognised as a valid extinct species by the IUCN Red List only in 2008. In 2014 a genetic study confirmed it as a distinct species related to the Nicobar pigeon, and showed that the two were the closest relatives of the extinct dodo and Rodrigues solitaire.|$|E

The <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> preceded by a period of pastoralism and that agriculture only became dominant {{in the course of the}} Archaic period is not supported by the archaeological or literary evidence. No technological innovations in agriculture appear to have occurred, except possibly the increased use of iron tools and more intensive use of manure.|$|E
25|$|Except for {{alluvial}} fans of impermeable clay {{the rock}} is highly porous {{due to a}} network of small faults, which dips into the warmer regions below the surface. Warm springs and vapors are common, giving the appearance of volcanic activity. The ancients cross-culturally viewed these phenomena as being caused by divinities, which rock-paintings indicate they worshipped. The north slopes of Latmus are subject to heavy and damaging mudslides, which also would {{have contributed to the}} <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a god.|$|E

Since dreams were usually prophetic, this {{depressed}} him, so his mother Frigg made every object on earth vow never to hurt Baldr. All objects made this vow except mistletoe—a detail which has traditionally been explained with the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too unimportant and nonthreatening to bother asking it to make the vow, but which Merrill Kaplan has instead argued echoes the fact that young people were not eligible to swear legal oaths, which could make them a threat later in life.|$|E
25|$|In its decision, {{the court}} first {{established}} the legal question {{with the use}} of precedents. It first stated that “Any system of prior restraints of expression comes to this Court bearing a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity”. The purpose of this statement was to make the presence of the inherent conflict between the Government’s efforts and the First Amendment clear. The decision then stated that the government “thus carries a heavy burden of showing justification for the imposition of such a restraint”. This reinforced the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the Nixon Administration's responsibility to show sufficient evidence that the newspapers’ actions would cause a “grave and irreparable” danger.|$|E
25|$|Indeed, {{the very}} {{title of the}} Malleus Maleficarum is feminine, {{alluding}} to the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> women who were the villains. Otherwise, {{it would be the}} Malleus Maleficorum (the masculine form of the Latin noun maleficus or malefica, 'witch'). In Latin, the feminine maleficarum would only be used for women, while the masculine maleficorum could be used for men alone or for both sexes if together. The Malleus Maleficarum accuses male and female witches of infanticide, cannibalism and casting evil spells to harm their enemies as well as having the power to steal a man's penis. It goes on to give accounts of witches committing these crimes.|$|E

25|$|Although {{ritualism}} had {{an aesthetic}} and ideological appeal {{for many in}} the cultural elite, and had a cognate relationship with the Gothic Revival, the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> inextricably linked with an inclination towards political despotism was a misapprehension. Ritualism had an appeal for many who were politically conservative and had supporters highly placed in the establishment (e.g. Viscount Halifax and the 4th Marquess of Bath). However, the outlook of many of the ritualist clergy themselves, many of whom inevitably operated {{in some of the most}} deprived communities in England, resulted in their becoming politically radicalised by the experience – some became ardent Christian Socialists.|$|E
25|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, {{a number of}} {{scholars}} began to study the history and origins of the Society. The first of these, J.M. McPherson, published his findings and theories in his Primitive Beliefs in the North-East of Scotland (1929), in which he outlined the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a survival of an ancient pagan cult that had been persecuted in the witch trials in the Early Modern period. Such ideas were supported by the folklorist Thomas Davidson in an article of his published {{on the subject of}} the Horseman's Word (1956), and then by George Ewart Evans, who purported the theory in four books of his published in the 1960s and 1970s. Neither Davidson nor Evans had examined the Horseman's Word through the original Scottish sources, while McPherson had only relied upon observations made in the late nineteenth century.|$|E
25|$|Based on a mark in an {{interior}} chamber naming the work gang and {{a reference to}} fourth dynasty Egyptian Pharaoh Khufu, Egyptologists believe that the pyramid was built as a tomb over a 10 to 20-year period concluding around 2560 BC. Initially at , the Great Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure {{in the world for}} more than 3,800 years. Originally, the Great Pyramid was covered by casing stones that formed a smooth outer surface; what is seen today is the underlying core structure. Some of the casing stones that once covered the structure can still be seen around the base. There have been varying scientific and alternative theories about the Great Pyramid's construction techniques. Most accepted construction hypotheses are based on the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> built by moving huge stones from a quarry and dragging and lifting them into place.|$|E

25|$|Manifest Destiny was the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> God’s {{will for}} the United States to expand {{because it is}} Protestant, democratic, and white. It {{promoted}} the notion of American racial superiority, casting all nonwhites, including Native Americans, Mexicans, and blacks, as inferior beings. John L. O'Sullivan coined the phrase in 1845, first using it in his newspaper, the United States Democratic Review. Manifest destiny soon became {{an important element of}} American political rhetoric. It called for the expansion of the United States and was a justification used by southerners for extending slavery. An example of this was the annexation of Texas. President James K. Polk used the argument of manifest destiny to support his intentions of claiming Texas. In 1845, Texas entered the United States as the fifteenth slave state. Since whites were seen as superior beings, slavery didn’t seem like such a brutal practice. The whites were not the ones suffering, and that is all that mattered.|$|E
25|$|During the Third Doctor's tenure, {{producer}} Barry Letts {{was adamant}} that the device {{not become a}} cure-all for the series, and limited its use to avoid writers becoming over-reliant on it. During this time, the device underwent significant design changes. In The Sea Devils, the Doctor used it to detonate landmines; Michael E. Briant explains that this was feasible, stating that the sonic waves shook the mines. In The Three Doctors the sonic screwdriver is almost unrecognisable, being a unique, one-use prop with a plastic red spherical head. In the DVD commentary, Letts himself remarks on {{the thickness of the}} prop {{and the fact that it}} belies the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the regular one, prompting Katy Manning to question whether it was indeed a sonic screwdriver. This was due to the serial being produced out of transmission order: the original sonic screwdriver prop went missing during the recording of Carnival of Monsters, requiring a new prop to be built for the rest of the season; The Three Doctors was recorded after Carnival, but set before it, so the screwdriver could be seen to revert to its previous appearance for one story after The Three Doctors before receiving a more permanent redesign thereafter.|$|E

At the annual conference of 1908, Crumpler was re-elected president of the body; however, with a majority of the delegates having experienced tongues, he permanently disaffiliated himself from the church. After Crumpler's departure, the conference added an article to the statement of faith, recognizing tongues as the initial evidence: ...|$|E

500|$|Moore has {{expressed}} dismay that [...] "he gritty, deconstructivist postmodern superhero comic, {{as exemplified by}} Watchmen [...] became a genre". He said in 2003 that [...] "to some degree there has been, in the 15 years since Watchmen, {{an awful lot of}} the comics field devoted to these grim, pessimistic, nasty, violent stories which kind of use Watchmen to validate what are, in effect, often just some very nasty stories that don't have a lot to recommend them". Gibbons said that while readers [...] "were left with the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a grim and gritty kind of thing", he said in his view the series was [...] "a wonderful celebration of superheroes as much as anything else".|$|E
500|$|Philip {{was known}} to be in the Berkshires in western Massachusetts that winter, and New Englanders accused Andros of {{sheltering}} him. [...] Historian John Fiske suggests that Philip's purpose was not to draw the Iroquois into the conflict, but instead to draw the Mahicans into the conflict with a view toward attacking Albany. [...] An offer by Andros to send New York troops into Massachusetts to attack Philip was rebuffed, based on the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> covert ploy to again assert authority to the Connecticut River. [...] Instead, Mohawks from the Albany area did battle with Philip, driving him eastward. [...] When Connecticut authorities later appealed to Andros for assistance, Andros replied that it was [...] "strange" [...] that they would do so, considering their previous behavior, and refused to help.|$|E
500|$|Much of Stelmach's term as Premier was {{dominated}} by questions related to the Athabasca Oil Sands. The rapid development of these reserves was fuelling the Alberta economy's strong growth, but also raised environmental questions. After winning the Premiership, Stelmach emphasized {{that he had no}} intention of taking measures that would slow down oilsands development and suggested that the economy would find its own appropriate growth rate. He aggressively defended Alberta's oil at home and abroad, and called the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> extracted at an unacceptably high environmental cost [...] "a myth". When Liberal Party of Canada leader Stéphane Dion proposed a federal carbon tax to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, Stelmach rejected the policy on the basis that it would hurt the economy and would unfairly penalize the western provinces. Instead, he championed the development of carbon capture technology. In July 2008, Stelmach announced $2billion worth of funding for carbon capture initiatives, for which he was applauded by industry groups. However, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business called it [...] "a huge amount of money to spend on something that isn't proven", and Mike Hudema of Greenpeace suggesting that there were better environmental uses of the money available.|$|E
