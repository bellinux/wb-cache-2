The effect of a semi-annular shield on <b>jet</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>noise</b> was investigted with the rationale that such a configuration would eliminate or reduce the multiple reflection mechanism. Noise measurements for a 10 cm conical nozzle with a semi-annular acoustic shield are presented in terms of lossless free field data at various angular locations with respect to the nozzle. Measurements were made on both the shielded and unshielded sides of the nozzle. The results are presented parametrically, showing the effects of various shield and central system velocities and temperatures.

Some of these results do not agree with projections based on classical jet noise theories nor with experimental results from model jet simulated flight tests. It has been shown that in some of the cases reported, the proper corrections were not made to account for the distributed nature of the jet noise sources. It is shown herein that the remaining discrepancies can be reconciled by considering the combined effects of jet-mixing <b>noise,</b> internally-generated engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>noise,</b> and shock noise.

40|$|Flight {{and wind}} tunnel noise tests were {{conducted}} using a J 85 turbojet engine {{as a part of}} comprehensive programs to obtain an understanding of forward velocity effects on <b>jet</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>noise.</b> Nozzle configurations of primary interest were a 104 -tube suppressor with and without an acoustically-treated shroud. The installed configuration of the engine was as similar as possible in the flight and wind tunnel tests. Exact simultaneous matching of engine speed, exhaust velocity, and exhaust temperature was not possible, and the wind tunnel maximum Mach number was approximately 0. 27, while the flight Mach number was approximately 0. 37. The nominal jet velocity range was 450 to 640 m/sec. For both experiments, background noise limited the jet velocity range for which significant data could be obtained.

The conventional profile coaxial nozzle jet noise is compared to the current NASA Lewis coaxial jet noise prediction and after applying an adjustment to the predicted levels based on {{the ratio of the}} kinetic energy of the primary and secondary flows, the prediction is within a standard deviation of 0. 9 dB of the measured data. The mass average (mixed flow) prediction is also compared to the noise data for the three mixer nozzles with a reasonably good fit after applying another kinetic energy ratio adjustment (standard deviation of 0. 7 to 1. 5 dB with the measured data).

The effects of water parameters such as mass flow rate, injection location, and spray patterns on suppression of dominant noise sources in both subsonic and supersonic jets were determined, and extrapolations to full-scale engine noise reduction were made. Water jets and sprays were injected in to the shear layers of cold and hot circular jets operating at both subsonic and supersonic exhaust conditions. Use of convergent-divergent and convergent nozzles (2. 7 ”D) allowed for simulations of all major jet noise sources. The experimental results show that water injection clearly disrupts shock noise sources within the jet plume, with large reductions in radiated shock noise. There are smaller reductions in jet mixing noise, resulting in only a small decrease in effective perceived noise level when projections are made to full scale. The fact that the measured noise reduction in the direction upstream of the nozzle was consistently larger than in the noisier downstream direction contributed to keeping effective perceived noise reductions small. Variations in the operation of the water injection system clearly show that injection at the nozzle exit rather than further downstream is required for the largest noise reduction.

40|$|A {{critical}} part of the NASA High-Speed Research (HSR) program is the demonstration of satisfactory suppression of the jet noise present at low airspeeds. One scheme for reducing <b>jet</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>noise</b> generated by a future High-Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) {{is the use of}} a mixer/ ejector system which would entrain large quantities of ambient air into the exhaust flow from the powerplant in order to cool and slow the jet exhaust before it leaves the tailpipe. Of the variety of factors which can affect the noise suppression characteristics of the mixer/ejector system, the influence of the wing flow field and high-lift devices is not well understood. The effectiveness of the noise suppression device must be evaluated {{in the presence of the}} wing/high-lift system before definitive assessments can be made concerning HSCT noise. Of nearly equal importance is the evaluation of the performance of the high-lift system(s) in the presence of realistic propulsion units which feature high ambient flow entrainment rates and jet thrust coefficients. These noise suppressors must provide the required acoustic attenuation while not overly degrading the thrust efficiency of the propulsion system or the lift enhancement of the high-lift devices on the wing. The overall objective of the NASA High-lift Engine Aeroacoustics Technology program is to demonstrate satisfactory interaction between the jet noise suppressor and the high-lift system at airspeeds and angles of attack consistent with takeoff, climb, approach, and landing. In support of this program, an isolated aeroacoustic test of a 13. 5 %-scale, candidate mixer/ejector nozzle was performed in the Ames' Research Center 40 - by 80 -Foot Wind Tunnel. The purpose of the test was to measure the baseline aeroacoustic performance characteristics of this nozzle in isolation from the aerodynamic flowfield induced by an HSCT airframe. The test documented the acoustic signature of the nozzles with treated and hardwall ejector surfaces and with changes in the ratio of ejector-duct-to-jet-area over a wide range range of nozzle pressure ratios and freestream Mach numbers. The test also measured the thrust performance, ambient-flow aspiration ratio, and internal and external static pressures on the nozzles. The isolated aeroacoustic performance data has been compared with results obtained with this nozzle installed on a 13. 5 % Boeing Reference H HSCT configuration, semi-span model. The semi-span, aeroacoustics integration test documented the first-order effects of the airframe flowfield on the acoustic performance of the nozzle and the effect of the nozzle secondary inlet flows on the aerodynamic performance of the wing high-lift systems. This investigation is critical to understanding the mutual installation effects of mixer/ejector nozzles and wing high-lift systems...|$|E

40|$|The {{recent efforts}} to develop {{accurate}} numerical schemes for transition and turbulent flows are motivated, among other factors, by the need for accurate prediction of flow noise. The success of developing high speed civil transport plane (HSCT) is contingent upon our understanding and suppression of the <b>jet</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>noise.</b> The radiated sound can be directly obtained by solving the full (time-dependent) compressible Navier-Stokes equations. However, this requires computational storage that is beyond currently available machines. This difficulty can be overcome by limiting the solution domain to the near field where the jet is nonlinear and then use acoustic analogy (e. g., Lighthill) to relate the far-field noise to the near-field sources. The later requires obtaining the time-dependent flow field. The other difficulty in aeroacoustics computations is that at high Reynolds numbers the turbulent flow has a large range of scales. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) cannot obtain all the scales of motion at high Reynolds number of technological interest. However, {{it is believed that}} the large scale structure is more efficient than the small-scale structure in radiating noise. Thus, one can model the small scales and calculate the acoustically active scales. The large scale structure in the noise-producing initial region of the jet {{can be viewed as a}} wavelike nature, the net radiated sound is the net cancellation after integration over space. As such, aeroacoustics computations are highly sensitive to errors in computing the sound sources. It is therefore essential to use a high-order numerical scheme to predict the flow field. The present paper presents the first step in a ongoing effort to predict jet noise. The emphasis here is in accurate prediction of the unsteady flow field. We solve the full time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations by a high order finite difference method. Time accurate spatial simulations of both plane and axisymmetric jet are presented. Jet Mach numbers of 1. 5 and 2. 1 are considered. Reynolds number in the simulations was about a million. Our numerical model is based on the 2 - 4 scheme by Gottlieb & Turkel. Bayliss et al. applied the 2 - 4 scheme in boundary layer computations. This scheme was also used by Ragab and Sheen to study the nonlinear development of supersonic instability waves in a mixing layer. In this study, we present two dimensional direct simulation results for both plane and axisymmetric jets. These results are compared with linear theory predictions. These computations were made for near nozzle exit region and velocity in spanwise/azimuthal direction was assumed to be zero...|$|E
