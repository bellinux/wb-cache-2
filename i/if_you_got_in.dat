500|$|Frank Orr, a {{columnist}} in the Toronto Star, suggested that Hextall's aggressive nature, {{which resulted in}} three suspensions of six or more games during his NHL career, was an intentional part of his game designed to protect him. He theorized that because Hextall's style of play frequently took {{him out of his}} goal crease, the threat of physical violence lessened the chances of him being challenged by an attacker when out of position. In the 1993 playoff series between the Montreal Canadiens and Hextall's Nordiques, the Canadiens' coach Jacques Demers designed a plan to disrupt Hextall's play after Montreal had lost its two first games to Quebec. He noted that Hextall would be off his game if he were disturbed or bumped. Montreal then won four straight games to win the series in six games. Demers felt that Hextall's emotional play lessened his effectiveness; while acknowledging him as a [...] "great competitor", he felt that [...] "he didn't reach the level of a Grant Fuhr or a Martin Brodeur [...] he lost his cool <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> his face." ...|$|E

The post proved to be a baptism of fire for the new director - although the company started out with classic works by Molière, Buchner and Strindberg, the season was disrupted when the theatre's main financier and manager gave up and vanished overnight, forcing the cast and crew to form a collective to keep the theatre going, and the program soon changed to comedies and melodramas - [...] "things that made money". Although Sirk later recalled the period as [...] "a pretty terrible time", it was here that he learned his craft, and how to handle actors in [...] "the most strained circumstances". This was during the period of runaway inflation in Germany, and Sirk remembered that after distributing money to the company, they would have to run to the bank with their takings just before midday, because at 12pm the banks would close their shutters and post the new dollar rate - [...] "... <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> too late, you had just a small percentage left of what you had earned ..." ...|$|E

6000|$|For the sea {{which each}} of us is sailing over is this world, and the ship in which {{each of us}} sails, is our own nature and character; what St Paul, like a truly {{scientific}} man, calls our flesh; and what modern scientific men, and rightly, call our organisation. And the land to which we are sailing is eternal Life. Shall we make a prosperous voyage? Shall we fail, or shall we succeed? Shall we founder and drown at sea, and sink to eternal death? Or shall we, as the clergyman prayed for us when we were baptized, so pass through the waves of this troublesome world, that finally we may come to the land of everlasting life? Which shall it be, my friends? Shall we sink, or shall we swim? Certain is one thing--that we shall sink, and not swim, if we do not learn and keep the law, and commandments, and testimonies, and judgments of God, concerning this our mortal life. If we do not, then we shall go through life, without knowing how to go through life, ignorantly and blindly; and the end of that will be failure, and ruin, and death to our souls. If we do not know and keep the Laws of God, the Laws of God will keep themselves, in spite of us, and grind us to powder. Do not fancy that you may do wrong without being punished; and break God's Law, because you are not under the law, but under grace. You are only under grace, as long as you keep clear of God's Law. The moment you do wrong you put yourself under the Law, and the Law will punish you. Suppose that you went into a mill; and that the owner of that mill was your best friend, even your father. Would that prevent your being crushed by the machinery, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> entangled <b>in</b> it through ignorance or heedlessness? I think not. Even so, though God be your best of friends, ay, your Father in heaven, that will not prevent your being injured, it may be ruined, not only by wilful sins, but by mere folly and ignorance. Therefore your only chance for safety in this life and for ever, is to learn God's laws and statutes about your life, that you may pass through it justly, honourably, virtuously, successfully. And the man who wrote the 119th Psalm knew that, and said, [...] "Oh that my ways were made so direct, that I might keep thy statutes." ...|$|R
