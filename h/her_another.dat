In 2009, after petitioning the Press Complaints Commission in the UK about being lied {{about in the}} press, five British tabloids (The Sun, The Daily Express, News of the World, Sunday Mirror and Daily Mirror) publicly apologised to Mills about printing false, hurtful or defamatory stories about <b>her.</b> <b>Another</b> tabloid (the Daily Mail), sent a private letter of apology. Mills has complained that over 4,400 abusive articles about her have been published.|$|E

5|$|A judge banned all filming {{but this}} ruling was {{overturned}} by an injunction. Although officials were angry, the residents were not and Jackson {{was surrounded by}} crowds of enthusiastic onlookers during filming. One woman managed to push through security to hug Jackson who continued dancing while hugging <b>her.</b> <b>Another</b> woman appeared and hugged him from behind. He then {{fell to the ground}} as police pulled the two women off him and escorted them away. After the director helped Jackson get up off the street, he continued to sing and dance. This incident made it into the music video. 1,500 policemen and 50 residents acting as security guards effectively sealed off the Dona Marta favela. Some residents and officials found it offensive that Jackson's production team had negotiated with drug dealers in order to gain permission to film in one of the city's shantytowns.|$|E
5|$|Later in 2004, Trisha {{played the}} role of a {{helpless}} girl a kabaddi player tries to save from a corrupt politician who wants to marry her in Ghilli. It was a major commercial success. She appeared in Mani Ratnam's political drama Aaytha Ezhuthu (2004), starring as part of an ensemble cast that included Siddharth, R. Madhavan and Suriya. The Telugu romantic comedy Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana (2005) featured Trisha as a village girl and was a commercial success. It earned <b>her</b> <b>another</b> Filmfare Award and her first Nandi Award for Best Actress. She reprised the role in the Tamil remake Unakkum Enakkum (2006) which was also successful. Selvaraghavan's Telugu film Aadavari Matalaku Arthale Verule (2007) won Trisha her third Filmfare Award. The same year she featured opposite Ajith Kumar in A. L. Vijay's Kireedam, a box office success. In 2008, her releases Bheemaa and Kuruvi both failed commercially, while Abhiyum Naanum and Krishna earned her Filmfare nominations for Best Actress in the Tamil and Telugu categories respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Streep starred {{opposite}} Clint Eastwood as an unhappily {{married woman}} in The Bridges of Madison County, her biggest critical and commercial {{success of the}} decade. Although her dramas of the late 1990s received a mixed reception overall, she was praised {{for her role as}} a cancer patient in One True Thing (1998). She had acclaimed roles in the 2002 films Adaptation and The Hours, and won a second Emmy Award for the television miniseries Angels in America a year later, though she failed to replicate her earlier success. This changed in 2006, with an Academy Award-nominated role as a ruthless fashion magazine editor in the comedy-drama The Devil Wears Prada. This late-period success led to starring roles in several high-profile films, including the US$609 million-grossing romantic comedy Mamma Mia! (2008), her highest-grossing release, and the comedy-drama Julie & Julia (2009), in which she played Julia Child. These roles re-established Streep's stardom in Hollywood. Her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher in the biopic The Iron Lady (2011) earned <b>her</b> <b>another</b> Academy Award for Best Actress. The starring role of Florence Foster Jenkins in the 2016 comedy-drama film of the same name garnered Streep her 20th Oscar nomination, more than any actor or actress in history.|$|E

5|$|Trisha {{starred in}} two films {{released}} in 2009: Sarvam and Sankham. The former was commercially unsuccessful, {{while the latter}} was critically derided. The following year, she played a Syrian Christian in Gautham Menon's romance Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa. It was a major commercial success and, {{as well as being}} a breakthrough film in her career, earned <b>her</b> <b>another</b> Filmfare nomination. The same year, she made her Hindi cinema debut with Khatta Meetha. Although a critical and commercial failure, it earned her nomination for a Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut. Her sole Telugu release that year was Namo Venkatesa. Both her 2011 releases– Teen Maar and Mankatha– were successful. She had two releases in 2012: Bodyguard (a Telugu remake of the 2010 Malayalam film of the same name) and Dammu. She appeared in two Tamil films in 2013: the mystery thriller Samar, and Endrendrum Punnagai, which earned her a Filmfare nomination. Her sole release in 2014 was Power, which marked her debut in Kannada cinema. Trisha's 2015 films included the crime drama Yennai Arindhaal, the comedy Sakalakala Vallavan, the Tamil-Telugu bilingual thriller Thoongaa Vanam / Cheekati Rajyam, and the sports drama Bhooloham. In 2016, she appeared in the comedy horror films Aranmanai 2 and the Tamil-Telugu bilingual Nayaki (spelt Nayagi in Tamil), followed by the political thriller Kodi, which earned her the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress– Tamil.|$|E

25|$|Religious {{concepts}} {{were tied}} {{into all of}} these symbols and titles. By the time of Hatshepsut's reign, the merger of some aspects of these two goddesses provided that they would both have given birth to, and were the protectors of, the pharaohs. They became interchangeable at times. Hatshepsut also traced her lineage to Mut, a primal mother goddess of the Egyptian pantheon, which gave <b>her</b> <b>another</b> ancestor who was a deity {{as well as her}} father and grandfathers, pharaohs who would have become deified upon death.|$|E
25|$|The narrator's {{standards}} for {{what constitutes a}} cliffhanger seem broader than in modern literature. While in many cases a story is cut off with the hero {{in danger of losing}} his life or another kind of deep trouble, {{in some parts of the}} full text Scheherazade stops her narration in the middle of an exposition of abstract philosophical principles or complex points of Islamic philosophy, and in one case during a detailed description of human anatomy according to Galen—and in all these cases turns out to be justified in her belief that the king's curiosity about the sequel would buy <b>her</b> <b>another</b> day of life.|$|E

25|$|According {{to certain}} fabulous reports of ancient writers, Plato's mother became {{pregnant}} from a divine vision: Ariston {{tried to force}} his attentions on Perictione, but failed of his purpose; then the ancient Greek god Apollo appeared {{to him in a}} vision, and, as a result of it, Ariston left Perictione unmolested. When she had given birth to Plato, only then did her husband lie with <b>her.</b> <b>Another</b> legend related that, while he was sleeping as an infant on Mount Hymettus in a bower of myrtles (his parents were sacrificing to the Muses and Nymphs), bees had settled on the lips of Plato; an augury of the sweetness of style in which he would discourse philosophy.|$|E
