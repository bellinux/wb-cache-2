5|$|Brooding {{species are}} most often ahermatypic (not reef-building) in areas of high current or wave action. Brooders release only sperm, which is {{negatively}} buoyant, sinking on to the waiting egg carriers who harbor unfertilized <b>eggs</b> <b>for</b> weeks. Synchronous spawning events sometimes occurs even with these species. After fertilization, the corals release planula that are ready to settle.|$|E

The precocial downy chicks are then led by the female to the nearest body of water, where they feed on dead insects on the water surface.

5|$|The loggerhead {{sea turtle}} {{is found in the}} Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, as well as the Mediterranean Sea.

The {{loggerhead sea turtle}} has a low reproductive rate; females lay an average of four egg clutches and then become , producing no <b>eggs</b> <b>for</b> two to three years. The loggerhead reaches sexual maturity within 17–33 years and has a lifespan of 47–67 years.|$|E
5|$|The nests, built {{entirely by}} the female, are mud {{plastered}} to cave entrances or rocky outcrops in forest ravines. The nests are often constructed from the saliva {{of the females}} mixed in with vegetable matter and mud. The nest is shaped like a concave cup. The female typically lays two white eggs. The females incubates these <b>eggs</b> <b>for</b> about 25 to 28 days.|$|E

5|$|Bacteria can {{be grown}} in the {{laboratory}} on nutrient culture media, but viruses need living cells in which to replicate. Many vaccines to infectious diseases {{can be grown}} in fertilised chicken eggs. Millions of eggs are used each year to generate the annual flu vaccine requirements, a complex process that takes about {{six months after the}} decision is made as to what strains of virus to include in the new vaccine. A problem with using <b>eggs</b> <b>for</b> this purpose is that people with egg allergies are unable to be immunised, but this disadvantage may be overcome as new techniques for cell-based rather than egg-based culture become available. Cell-based culture will also be useful in a pandemic when {{it may be difficult to}} acquire a sufficiently large quantity of suitable sterile, fertile eggs.|$|E
5|$|Both species {{typically}} {{breed in}} small groups: the Mascarene martin builds a shallow cup nest of twigs and coarse plant material {{with a soft}} inner lining, whereas Brazza's martin makes a small heap of soft material such as feathers or dry grass {{at the end of}} a typically 50-cm (20-in) tunnel in a riverbank. The normal clutch is three <b>eggs</b> <b>for</b> Brazza's martin, two for Mascarene martins on Madagascar and Mauritius, and two or three for those on Réunion. As with other swallows, both martins feed on flying insects, hunting in single-species groups or with other swallows and swifts.|$|E
5|$|The clutch is {{two to five}} {{eggs that}} are white with brownish, ruddy or grey blotches {{particularly}} at the wide end. The egg size ranges from an average 20.2x14.0mm (0.80x0.55in) with a weight of 2.08g (0.073oz) for the Eurasian crag martin to 17.7x13.0mm (0.70x0.51in) with a weight of 1.57g (0.06oz) for the dusky crag martin. Both adults incubate the <b>eggs</b> <b>for</b> 13–19 days to hatching, and feed the chicks at least ten times an hour until they fledge 24–27 days later. The fledged young continue to be fed by the parents for some time after they can fly.|$|E

5|$|Breeding occurs {{from late}} August through to January, though heavy rain in August may delay this. The nest is {{built by the}} female; it is a round or domed {{structure}} made of loosely woven grasses and spider webs, with an entrance in one side {{close to the ground}} and well-concealed in thick and often thorny vegetation, such as Acacia pulchella or a species of Hakea. One or two broods may be laid during the breeding season. A clutch of two to four dull white eggs with reddish-brown splotches and spots, measuring 12 × 16mm (½×⅝in), are laid. Incubation takes about two weeks. The female incubates the <b>eggs</b> <b>for</b> 14 or 15days; after hatching, nestlings are fed and their fecal sacs removed by all group members for 10–13days, by which time they are fledged. Young birds remain in the family group as helpers {{for a year or more}} before moving to another group, usually an adjacent one, or assuming a dominant position in the original group. In this role they feed and care for subsequent broods.|$|E
5|$|Female {{cockroaches}} {{are sometimes}} seen carrying egg cases {{on the end}} of their abdomens; the German cockroach holds about 30 to 40 long, thin eggs in a case called an ootheca. She drops the capsule prior to hatching, though live births do occur in rare instances. The egg capsule may take more than five hours to lay and is initially bright white in color. The eggs are hatched from the combined pressure of the hatchlings gulping air. The hatchlings are initially bright white nymphs and continue inflating themselves with air, becoming harder and darker within about four hours. Their transient white stage while hatching and later while molting has led to claims of albino cockroaches. Development from eggs to adults takes three to four months. Cockroaches live up to a year, and the female may produce up to eight egg cases in a lifetime; in favorable conditions, she can produce 300 to 400 offspring. Other species of cockroaches, however, can produce far more eggs; in some cases a female needs to be impregnated only once to be able to lay <b>eggs</b> <b>for</b> the rest of her life.|$|E
5|$|Some of Aristotle's {{observations}} were not taken seriously by science {{until they were}} independently rediscovered in the 19th century. For example, he recorded that male octopuses have a hectocotylus, a tentacle which stores sperm and which can transfer it into the female's body; sometimes it snaps off during mating. The account was dismissed as fanciful until the French naturalist Georges Cuvier described it in his 1817 Le Règne Animal. Aristotle {{also noted that the}} young of the dogfish grow inside their mother's body attached by a cord to something like a placenta (a yolk sac). This was confirmed in 1842 by the German zoologist Johannes Peter Müller. Aristotle noted, too, that a river catfish which he called the glanis cares for its young, as the female leaves after giving birth; the male guards the <b>eggs</b> <b>for</b> forty or fifty days, chasing off small fish which threaten the eggs, and making a murmuring noise. The Swiss American zoologist Louis Agassiz found the account to be correct in 1890.|$|E

5|$|The clutch {{is usually}} {{two or three}} buff-white eggs blotched with sepia or grey-brown, {{particularly}} at the wide end. The average egg size for Asian birds was 19.3x12.9mm (0.76x0.51in) with a weight of 1.7g (0.06oz). Both adults incubate the <b>eggs</b> <b>for</b> 16–19 days prior to hatching and feed the chicks about ten times an hour until they fledge and for several days after they can fly. The fledging time can vary from 22–24days to 25–30days, though the latter estimates probably take into account fledged young returning to the nest for food. If a nest is destroyed, or the breeding attempt otherwise fails, a replacement clutch may be laid, typically with fewer eggs. Two nests in Arabia were used in spring {{and again in the}} autumn, but it is not known if the same pair were involved.|$|E
5|$|Some frogs {{protect their}} {{offspring}} inside their own bodies. Both {{male and female}} pouched frogs (Assa darlingtoni) guard their eggs, which are laid on the ground. When the eggs hatch, the male lubricates his body with the jelly surrounding them and immerses himself in the egg mass. The tadpoles wriggle into skin pouches on his side, where they develop until they metamorphose into juvenile frogs. The female gastric-brooding frog (Rheobatrachus sp.) from Australia, now probably extinct, swallows her fertilized eggs, which then develop inside her stomach. She ceases to feed and stops secreting stomach acid. The tadpoles rely on the yolks of the <b>eggs</b> <b>for</b> nourishment. After six or seven weeks, they are ready for metamorphosis. The mother regurgitates the tiny frogs, which hop away from her mouth. The female Darwin's frog (Rhinoderma darwinii) from Chile lays up to 40 eggs on the ground, where they are guarded by the male. When the tadpoles are about to hatch, they are engulfed by the male, which carries them around inside his much-enlarged vocal sac. Here they are immersed in a frothy, viscous liquid that contains some nourishment to supplement what they obtain from the yolks of the eggs. They remain in the sac for seven to ten weeks before undergoing metamorphosis, after which they move into the male's mouth and emerge.|$|E
