Materials and Methods: The participants in this cross-sectional study were 330 individuals, including 300 nurses and 30 managers, working in hospitals affiliated to Tehran university of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran during 2008 - 2009. Data were collected using a valid self-administered questionnaire containing 30 questions designed by the investigator. The SPSS software was used for data analysis. Results: The data show that 178 of the staff (59 %) and 14 of the managers (47 %) were of the opinion that avoidance is not utilized <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>management.</b> The proportions of the staff and managers believing that problem solution is not utilized <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>management</b> were 60 % and 60 %, respectively; the corresponding proportions as regards not utilizing avoidance were 178 % and 14 %.

The “ideal ” goal <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>management</b> is to achieve positive changes and avoid unnecessary escalation to destructive levels. While {{it has been argued}} that the role of local institutions <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>management</b> is central, little is known about how these institutions could actually deal with <b>conflict.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, we highlight how local institutions respond to the various inter-settlement conflicts over the issue of unclear resource boundaries in Danau Sentarum National Park (DNSP). We discuss <b>conflict</b> <b>management</b> approaches taken by the Dayak and the Malay ethnic groups in response to forestry and fishery conflicts and consider their effectiveness. We also demonstrate how customary laws are used <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>management.</b> We identify gaps in these approaches and discuss several possible ways forward. We argue that enhancing communication and developing a mechanism of exchange among various ethnic groups will allow better understanding of different and often contradicting customary laws. We also propose a kind of co-management arrangement among stakeholders (e. g., park management, local people, governments and NGOs) to ensure the sustainability of the park and to constructively manage the ever increasing conflict among these stakeholders...|$|R

40|$|Keywords: natural {{resource}} conflict, power, actor-empowerment, Ghana Increasingly, conflicts over {{natural resource}} (NR) use and management have {{attracted the attention}} of both scholars and professionals. While the recognition that conflict has both constructive and destructive capabilities have dawn on us, the negative outcomes have been prominent in many cases, calling for innovations <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>management.</b> The question of 'power' has been observed as crucial to any such innovations <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>management.</b> However, it has been noted that current approaches to the study of conflict and power do not offer in-depth understanding of power and how it plays itself out <b>in</b> NR <b>conflicts.</b> Besides, the role of power <b>in</b> NR <b>conflicts</b> has not been well studied. The aim {{of the study was to}} enlighten current understanding of the role of power <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>management</b> interventions by investigating the patterns of strategies and resources that conflict actors used to empower themselves and others to manage impairments. The study established that actor-empowerment is highly context bound and conflict interventions cannot benefit from any predictive patterns such as strategy reciprocity. Thus, instead of relying on predictions of reciprocity from game models, it has been argued that intervention will benefit from understanding actor and systemic factors that constrain the mobilisation of specific resources for mutual influence. It has also been pointed out that our understanding of the role of power <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> can be enhanced using chronological reconstruction of conflicts and studying conflicts as a two-actor game model...|$|R

Although many Chinese corporations have showed great {{power in the}} last few years, not many of them expanded successfully compared to western multinational corporations.

These differences are linked to Ruble and Thomas’s <b>conflict</b> <b>management</b> model <b>in</b> order to find out the difference in preferred approaches used <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>management</b> and how they influence the performance of Chinese corporations in internationalisation. Findings from this research show that the differences between Chinese culture and western culture lead to a different preference in terms of the approaches used <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>management.</b> Moreover, the different approaches have some negative impact on the internationalisation of Chinese corporations. However, the lack of Cultural Intelligence is also concerned as a negative factor in the discussion.

The main question was whether young children’s use of psychologically complex strategies <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>management</b> depends on language development. It is hypothesized that 2 -year-olds rely on verbal adaptive modification strategies less often than 3 -year-olds; and that children with a home language different from the dominant one in the childcare center also use verbal modification strategies less often. The overall conclusion is that the use of psychologically complex strategies <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>management</b> does not totally depend on language development.

The descriptive survey research design was used. The population of the study comprised 1602 teachers in 89 public boarding secondary schools in Western Province, Kenya. The respondents comprised teachers in public boarding secondary schools in Western Province.

The population was divided into homogeneous subgroups and a simple random sampling in each subgroup was done. Data was collected by use of questionnaires, document analysis and interviews. In order to ascertain content and face validity, the questionnaires and interview schedules were given to experts who matched all the items with the research questions to ascertain whether the instrument actually measured all that it was supposed to measure. The reliability of the instruments was determined through the test retest reliability of the instruments. Data was analyzed by the use of descriptive statistics of frequencies and percentage.

40|$|During {{the past}} 30 years, IR Scholars have {{underlined}} {{the increase of}} IGO's involvement <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>management</b> processes {{as well as the}} emergence of new forms of intervention such as partnerships (Bah and Jones, 2008), simultaneous peace operations (Balas, 2010) or collective <b>conflict</b> <b>management</b> (Crocker and al 2011). Besides these new forms of intevention caracterized by ad hoc and non stable interactions between IGOs, there is another kind of interaction, networked forms of intervention, that have been understudied so far by IR scholars. Contrary to the others, these new kinds of intervention are caraterized by recurrent, relatively stable, non ad-hoc forms of co-operation between two or more IGOs in the same policy domain. This article adresses two questions. The first deals with the caracteristics of networked forms of intervention <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>management.</b> So far, the main typologies intend to compare institutional arrangements with respect to degree of institutionalization or degree of coordination. In this article, we suggest that structural criteria, such as degree of segmentation, degree of centralization and degree of redundancy may also provide very useful insights about the design of these networked forms of <b>conflict</b> <b>management.</b> Secondly, this article focuses on the effect(s) of inter-organizational relations (IOR) among IGO. Using the new Database of Inter-organizational Relations <b>in</b> <b>conflicts</b> (DIORc), this article aims at comparing, with a social network perspective, the effects of IOR in the cases of Kosovo and South-Ossetia, two violent and highly internationzalised conflict where the same group of IGOs have been jointly involved for years. Whereas the question of institutional performance remains central in the field of international institutional, collective legitimacy and structural power seems to be the more important effects of networked forms of intervention <b>in</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>management.</b> Finally, this article aims at illustrating the added value of social network analysis to study IGO's interactions...|$|R
