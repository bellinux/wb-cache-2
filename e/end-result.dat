The primary objective of this aim was to transform Germany into a complete economic autarky, the <b>end-result</b> of which would be a state of continent-wide German hegemony over Europe. This was to be accomplished through the enlargement of the territorial base of the German state and the expansion of the German population, and the wholesale extermination of the indigenous Slavic inhabitants and the Germanisation of Baltic inhabitants.|$|E

25|$|Al Jazeera: Was {{approved}} by the CRTC in 2004 as an optional cable and satellite offering, but {{on the condition that}} any carrier distributing it must edit out any instances of illegal hate speech. Cable companies declared that these restrictions would make it too expensive to carry Al Jazeera. Although no cable company released data as to what such a monitoring service would cost, the <b>end-result</b> was that no cable company elected to carry the station, either, leaving many Arabic-speaking Canadians using free-to-air satellite dishes to watch the station. The Canadian Jewish Congress has expressed its opinion over possible anti-Semitic incitement on this station and that the restrictions on Al Jazeera are appropriate, while the Canadian B'nai Brith is opposed to any approval of Al Jazeera in Canada.

25|$|If herd {{immunity}} {{has been established}} and maintained in a population for a sufficient time, the disease is inevitably eliminated—no more endemic transmissions occurs. If elimination is achieved worldwide {{and the number of}} cases is permanently reduced to zero, then a disease can be declared eradicated. Eradication can thus be considered the final effect or <b>end-result</b> of public health initiatives to control the spread of infectious disease. The benefits of eradication include ending all morbidity and mortality caused by the disease, financial savings for individuals, health care providers, and governments, and enabling resources used to control the disease to be used elsewhere. To date, two diseases have been eradicated using {{herd immunity}} and vaccination: rinderpest and smallpox. Eradication efforts that rely on herd immunity are currently underway for poliomyelitis, though civil unrest and distrust of modern medicine have made this difficult. Voluntary vaccination, for a variety of reasons, may be an obstacle to eradication if not enough people become immune to a disease.|$|E

2500|$|In 1969, Nobel Prize-winning {{economist}} Thomas Schelling published [...] "Models of Segregation", a {{paper in}} which he demonstrated through a [...] "checkerboard model" [...] and mathematical analysis, that even when every agent prefers {{to live in a}} mixed-race neighborhood, almost complete segregation of neighborhoods emerges as individual decisions accumulate. In his [...] "tipping model", he showed that members of an ethnic group do not move out of a neighborhood as long as the proportion of other ethnic groups is relatively low, but if a critical level of other ethnicities is exceeded, the original residents may make rapid decisions and take action to leave. This tipping point is viewed as simply the <b>end-result</b> of domino effect originating when the threshold of the majority ethnicity members with the highest sensitivity to sameness is exceeded. If these people leave and are either not replaced or replaced by other ethnicities, then this in turn raises the level of mixing of neighbors, exceeding the departure threshold for additional people.|$|E
2500|$|Teaching is {{a highly}} {{specialized}} aspect of learning in which the [...] "teacher" [...] (demonstrator) adjusts their behaviour to increase the probability of the [...] "pupil" [...] (observer) achieving the desired <b>end-result</b> of the behaviour. For example, killer whales are known to intentionally beach themselves to catch pinniped prey. Mother killer whales teach their young to catch pinnipeds by pushing them onto the shore and encouraging them to attack the prey. Because the mother killer whale is altering her behaviour to help her offspring learn to catch prey, this is evidence of teaching. Teaching {{is not limited to}} mammals. Many insects, for example, have been observed demonstrating various forms of teaching to obtain food. Ants, for example, will guide each other to food sources through a process called [...] "tandem running," [...] in which an ant will guide a companion ant to a source of food. It has been suggested that the pupil ant is able to learn this route to obtain food in the future or teach the route to other ants.This behaviour of teaching is also exemplified by crows, specifically New Caledonian crows. The adults (whether individual or in families) teach their young adolescent offspring how to construct and utilize tools. For example; Pandanus branches are used to extract insects and other larvae from holes within trees.|$|E
2500|$|After the war, {{two studies}} of the {{repatriation}} of American prisoners of war by Robert Lifton and by Edgar Schein concluded that brainwashing (called [...] "thought reform" [...] by Lifton and [...] "coercive persuasion" [...] by Schein) had a transient effect. Both researchers found that the Chinese mainly used coercive persuasion to disrupt {{the ability of the}} prisoners to organize and maintain morale and hence to escape. By placing the prisoners under conditions of physical and social deprivation and disruption, and then by offering them more comfortable situations such as better sleeping quarters, better food, warmer clothes or blankets, the Chinese did succeed in getting some of the prisoners to make anti-American statements. Nevertheless, the majority of prisoners did not actually adopt Communist beliefs, instead behaving as though they did {{in order to avoid the}} plausible threat of extreme physical abuse. Both researchers also concluded that such coercive persuasion succeeded only on a minority of POWs, and that the <b>end-result</b> of such coercion remained very unstable, as most of the individuals reverted to their previous condition soon after they left the coercive environment. In 1961 they both published books expanding on these findings. Schein published Coercive Persuasion and Lifton published Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism. More recent writers including Mikhail Heller have suggested that Lifton's model of brainwashing may throw light on the use of mass propaganda in other communist states such as the former Soviet Union.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSchistosoma-associated bladder {{cancer was}} believed, for several decades, to be a {{completely}} unique entity of disease, different from urothelial cancer. This was {{probably due to}} its distinct clinicopathologic and demographic features that varied from those of urothelial entity. The carcinogenesis is an extremely complex process resulting from the accumulation of many genetic and epigenetic changes leading to alterations in the cell proliferation regulation process. In bladder cancer, many of these carcinogenic cascades were not fully documented or somewhat conflicting. Inspite of the efforts performed, much is still needed to explore {{the presence or absence}} of the carcinogenic difference with a different etiology. The control of schistosomiasis in certain countries and the subsequent decrease in the intensity of infestation showed changing of features approaching that of urothelial tumors. However the schistosoma-associated bladder cancer presented in more advanced stages than schistosoma-non associated urothelial cancer. More recently, data are gathered that, upon applying the same treatment protocol and management care, stage by stage comparison of the treatment <b>end-results</b> were found to be similar in bladder cancer patients with a different etiology. All treatment options; including radical cystectomy with or without adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemo- or radiotherapy or trimodality bladder preserving treatment seem to lead to similar <b>end-results</b> regardless of etiologic factor(s) implicated in bladder cancer development...|$|R
