5000|$|The {{show has}} courted a massive {{controversy}} as it depicts a 9 year old boy following and wooing {{a girl who}} is double his age. An online petition to ban the show was initiated which was signed by many people who wrongly believed that the show was promoting child marriage. The case reached the BCCC, who have asked the makers of the show to change the time slot so the kids shouldn't watch it and air it to 10pm slot along with a <b>disclaimer</b> <b>message</b> {{that it does not}} promote child marriage.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} hypothesizes {{and tests}} {{a model of}} how children process {{and make sense of}} disclaimers in television advertisements. An experimental design is employed to examine the effect of disclaimer explicitness on preschool children 2 ̆ 7 s understanding of <b>disclaimer</b> <b>messages</b> while controlling for other potentially influential factors such as prior familiarity with products advertised, level of cognitive development and attention to disclaimers. This study also examines the degree to which children use their understanding of <b>disclaimer</b> <b>messages</b> to update their expectations of the capabilities or limitations of products advertised. A causal model is tested and the results suggest that disclaimer wording influences attention to disclaimers, but that more simply worded disclaimers do not guarantee better understanding of <b>disclaimer</b> <b>messages</b> as prior research has suggested. Instead, level of cognitive development has a greater impact on understanding of disclaimers than does disclaimer explicitness. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{found no}} {{evidence}} that consumers benefit from government-mandated disclaimers in advertising. Experiments and common experience show that admonishments to change or avoid behaviors often have effects opposite to those intended. We found 18 experimental studies that provided evidence relevant to mandatory <b>disclaimers.</b> Mandated <b>messages</b> increased confusion in all, and were ineffective or harmful in the 15 studies that examined perceptions, attitudes, or decisions. We conducted an experiment on the effects of a government-mandated disclaimer for a Florida court case. Two advertisements for dentists offering implant dentistry were shown to 317 subjects. One advertiser had implant dentistry credentials. Subjects exposed to the disclaimer more often recommended the advertiser who lacked credentials. Women and less-educated subjects were particularly prone to this error. In addition, subjects drew false and damaging inferences about the credentialed dentist. ...|$|R
50|$|In contrast, some {{messages}} are often accompanied with a discounting cue (e.g., a <b>message</b> <b>disclaimer,</b> a low-credibility source) that would arouse a recipient’s suspicion {{of the validity}} of the message and suppress any attitude change that might occur by exposure to the message alone. Furthermore, when people are exposed to a persuasive message followed by a discounting cue, people tend to be more persuaded over time; this {{is referred to as the}} sleeper effect (Hovland & Weiss, 1951; Cook & Flay, 1978).|$|R
