50|$|In men, {{the most}} common {{symptoms}} of <b>hyperprolactinaemia</b> are decreased libido, sexual dysfunction (in both men and women), erectile dysfunction, infertility, and gynecomastia. Because men have no reliable indicator such as menstruation to signal a problem, many men with <b>hyperprolactinaemia</b> being caused by a pituitary adenoma may delay going to the doctor until they have headaches or eye problems caused by the enlarged pituitary pressing against the adjacent optic chiasm. They may not recognize a gradual loss of sexual function or libido. Only after treatment do some men realize they {{had a problem with}} sexual function.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hyperprolactinaemia</b> or hyperprolactinemia is the {{presence}} of abnormally high levels of prolactin in the blood. Normal levels are less than 500 mIU/L ng/mL or µg/L for women, and less than 450 mIU/L for men.|$|E
50|$|People with {{a history}} of ADHD, restless legs syndrome, <b>hyperprolactinaemia,</b> and Parkinson's disease should be closely {{monitored}} when using dopamine antagonists for treatment of emesis. People who take antipsychotics are recommended not to take metoclopramide.|$|E

Ahumada-Del Castillo syndrome) of <b>hyperprolactinaemia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pericyazine is {{a rather}} sedating and {{anticholinergic}} antipsychotic, and despite being classed with the typical antipsychotics, its risk of extrapyramidal side effects is comparatively low. It has a relatively high risk of causing <b>hyperprolactinaemia</b> and a moderate risk of causing weight gain and orthostatic hypotension.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of moderately raised prolactin levels (up to 5000IU/mL) are {{not due to}} microprolactinomas but other causes. The effects of some prescription drugs are the most common. Other causes are other pituitary tumours and normal pregnancy and breastfeeding. This is discussed more under <b>hyperprolactinaemia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Apart from {{diagnosing}} <b>hyperprolactinaemia</b> and hypopituitarism, prolactin {{levels are}} often checked by physicians in patients that {{have suffered a}} seizure, when there is doubt {{as to whether they}} have had an epileptic seizure or a non-epileptic seizure. Shortly after epileptic seizures, prolactin levels often rise, whereas they are normal in non-epileptic seizures.|$|E
5000|$|Remoxipride # has a risk {{of causing}} aplastic anaemia and, hence, has been {{withdrawn}} from the market worldwide. It has also been found to possess relatively low (virtually absent) potential to induce <b>hyperprolactinaemia</b> and extrapyramidal symptoms, likely attributable to its comparatively weak binding to (and, hence, rapid dissociation from) the D2 receptor.|$|E
50|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) {{associated with}} metoclopramide therapy include restlessness (akathisia), and focal dystonia. Infrequent ADRs include hypertension, hypotension, <b>hyperprolactinaemia</b> leading to galactorrhea, constipation, depression, headache, and extrapyramidal effects such as oculogyric crisis. Rare but serious ADRs associated with metoclopramide therapy include agranulocytosis, supraventricular tachycardia, hyperaldosteronism, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, akathisia and tardive dyskinesia.|$|E
50|$|Prolactin is a {{peptide hormone}} {{produced}} by the anterior pituitary gland that is primarily associated with lactation and plays {{a vital role in}} breast development during pregnancy. <b>Hyperprolactinaemia</b> may cause galactorrhea (production and spontaneous flow of breast milk) and disruptions in the normal menstrual period in women and hypogonadism, infertility and erectile dysfunction in men.|$|E
50|$|Prochlorperazine is {{analogous}} to chlorpromazine, both of these agents antagonize dopaminergic D2 receptors in various pathways of the central nervous system. This D2 blockade results in antipsychotic, antiemetic and other effects. <b>Hyperprolactinaemia</b> is {{a side effect of}} dopamine antagonists as blockade of D2 receptors within the tuberoinfundibular pathway results in increased plasma levels of prolactin due to increased secretion by lactotrophs in the anterior pituitary.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hyperprolactinaemia</b> may {{be caused}} by either {{disinhibition}} (e.g., compression of the pituitary stalk or reduced dopamine levels) or excess production from a prolactinoma (a type of pituitary adenoma). A blood serum prolactin level of 1000-5000 mIU/L could be from either mechanism, but >5000 mIU/L (>200 µg/L) is likely due to the activity of an adenoma; macroadenomas (large tumours over 10 mm diameter) have levels of prolactin up to 100,000 mIU/L.|$|E
50|$|Prolactin {{secretion}} in the pituitary {{is normally}} suppressed by the brain chemical dopamine. Drugs that block {{the effects of}} dopamine at the pituitary or deplete dopamine stores in the brain may cause the pituitary to secrete prolactin. These drugs include the major tranquillizers (phenothiazines), trifluoperazine (Stelazine), and haloperidol (Haldol); antipsychotic medications, such as risperidone and quetiapine; metoclopramide (Reglan), domperidone, cisapride used to treat gastro-oesophageal reflux; medication-induced nausea (such as cancer drugs); and, less often, alpha-methyldopa and reserpine, used to control hypertension; and estrogens and TRH. The sleep drug ramelteon (Rozerem) also {{increases the risk of}} <b>hyperprolactinaemia.</b> A benzodiazepine analog, etizolam, can also increase the risk of <b>hyperprolactinaemia.</b> In particular, the dopamine antagonists metoclopramide and domperidone are both powerful prolactin stimulators and have been used to stimulate breast milk secretion for decades. However, since prolactin is antagonized by dopamine and the body depends on the two being in balance, the risk of prolactin stimulation is generally present with all drugs that deplete dopamine, either directly or as a rebound effect.|$|E
5000|$|Today, {{the term}} [...] "phenothiazines" [...] {{describes}} {{the largest of}} the five main classes of antipsychotic drugs. These drugs have antipsychotic and, often, antiemetic properties, although they may also cause severe side effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms (including akathisia and tardive dyskinesia), <b>hyperprolactinaemia,</b> and the rare but potentially fatal neuroleptic malignant syndrome, as well as substantial weight gain. [...] Use of phenothiazines has been associated with antiphospholipid syndrome, but no causal relationship has been established.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hyperprolactinaemia</b> {{results from}} {{antagonism}} of the D2 receptors {{located on the}} lactotrophic cells found in the anterior pituitary gland. Amisulpride has a high propensity for elevating plasma prolactin levels {{as a result of}} its poor blood-brain barrier penetrability and hence the resulting greater ratio of peripheral D2 occupancy to central D2 occupancy. This means that to achieve the sufficient occupancy (~60-80%) of the central D2 receptors in order to elicit its therapeutic effects a dose must be given that is enough to saturate peripheral D2 receptors including those in the anterior pituitary.|$|E
50|$|Other {{forms of}} therapy (psychotherapy, {{occupational}} therapy/ergotherapy, or social rehabilitation) should be instituted properly.PET imaging {{studies have suggested}} low doses are preferable. Clinical response was associated with at least 65% occupancy of D2 receptors, while greater than 72% was likely to cause <b>hyperprolactinaemia</b> and over 78% associated with extrapyramidal side effects. Doses of haloperidol greater than 5 mg increased the risk of side effects without improving efficacy. Patients responded with doses under even 2 mg in first-episode psychosis. For maintenance treatment of schizophrenia, an international consensus conference recommended a reduction dosage by about 20% every 6 months until a minimal maintenance dose is established.|$|E
5000|$|Undiagnosed and {{untreated}} coeliac disease (CD). Coeliac men {{may have}} reversible infertility. Nevertheless, CD can present with several non-gastrointestinal symptoms that can involve nearly any organ system, {{even in the}} absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Thus, the diagnosis may be missed, leading to a risk of long-term complications. In men, CD can reduce semen quality and cause immature secondary sex characteristics, hypogonadism and <b>hyperprolactinaemia,</b> which causes impotence and loss of libido. The giving of gluten free diet and correction of deficient dietary elements can lead to a return of fertility. [...] It is likely that an effective evaluation for infertility would best include assessment for underlying celiac disease, both in men and women.|$|E
