5|$|In 2012, {{during the}} {{contract}} {{negotiations between the}} city the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), compromise {{could not be reached}} over issues like health insurance increases, teacher evaluations, and seniority pay increases. On August 8, 2012, the CTU voted 90% to authorize a strike. On September 10, the CTU began a strike after CTU President Lewis declared that negotiations with the city were not succeeding. On September 14, the CTU reached a tentative agreement with the city which included preferences for teachers who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> due to a school closing to be hired in another school and student test scores having less of a role in teacher evaluations than the city had originally planned. This tentative agreement did not hold, and the strike continued, after which Emanuel announced his intention to seek a legal injunction, forcing teachers back to work. On September 17, Emanuel's efforts to end the strike stalled as the walkout went into the second week. Delegates from the CTU voted to end the strike on September 18, 2012, and students began their return to the schools the following day.|$|E
2500|$|A {{group called}} FACE Intel (Former and Current Employees of Intel) claims that Intel weeds out older employees. FACE Intel claims {{that more than}} 90 {{percent of people who}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> or fired from Intel are over the age of 40. [...] Upside {{magazine}} requested data from Intel breaking out its hiring and firing by age, but the company declined to provide any.

[...] Hamidi was blocked in a 1999 court decision from using Intel's email system to distribute criticism of the company to employees, which overturned in 2003 in Intel Corp. v. Hamidi.|$|E

Pareto optimality, with costly monitoring, will entail some unemployment, since unemployment plays a socially valuable role in creating work incentives.
