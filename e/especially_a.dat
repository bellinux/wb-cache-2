During a pope's visit, the national flag is usually flown together with yellow and white Church flags, and white and blue Marian flags. It is uncommon to fly the national flag on personal occasions, such as birthdays or weddings.|$|E

5|$|A {{group of}} cats is {{referred}} to as a clowder or a glaring, a male cat is called a tom or tomcat (or a gib, if neutered), an unaltered female is called a queen, and a juvenile cat {{is referred to}} as a kitten. The male progenitor of a cat, <b>especially</b> <b>a</b> pedigreed cat, is its sire, and its female progenitor is its dam. In Early Modern English, the word kitten was interchangeable with the now obsolete word catling.|$|E

5|$|As {{the most}} {{successful}} early adaptation of Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Sullivan's play influenced subsequent versions. Later adaptations followed his simplification of the narrative, addition of women characters (<b>especially</b> <b>a</b> romance for Jekyll) and highlighting of the moral contrast between Jekyll and Hyde. Most versions retain the practice of having one actor play Jekyll and Hyde, with the transformation seen by the audience. Several early film versions relied more on Sullivan's play than Stevenson's novella.|$|E
5|$|Body adaptations, <b>especially</b> <b>a</b> paddle-like tail, help banded sea kraits to swim. These adaptations {{are also}} found in more distantly related sea snakes (Hydrophiinae) because of {{convergent}} evolution. However, because {{of the differences in}} motion between crawling and swimming, these same adaptations impede the snake's terrestrial motion. On dry land, a banded sea krait can still move, but, on average, at only slightly more than a fifth of its swimming speed. In contrast, most other non-Laticauda sea snakes are virtually stranded on dry land.|$|E
5|$|For some time, {{there had}} been concern {{about the power of}} the railroads and the way they charged {{different}} rates for different customers. In 1885, a bill to regulate the practice, authored by John Henninger Reagan, of Texas passed the House. The Reagan bill forbade discrimination in railroad or pipeline freight rates, required that rates be reasonable, and fixed maximum charges allowed. Sherman agreed with the general idea of the law, but objected to certain portions, <b>especially</b> <b>a</b> provision that gave state courts jurisdiction over enforcement disputes. Sherman believed the law should allow for more nuance as well, insisting that competition against other forms of transit be considered. These changes were adopted in the conference committee and the result, the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, owed much to Sherman's influence. Cleveland signed it into law on February 4, 1887, and appointed members to the new Interstate Commerce Commission. The act displeased the railroad industry, but was a boon to farmers and the oil industry.|$|E

5|$|In the 9th {{century the}} Polish lands {{were still on}} the {{peripheries}} of medieval Europe as regards its major powers and events, but a measure of progress did take place in levels of civilization, as evidenced by the number of gords built, kurgans raised and movable equipment used. The tribal elites must have been influenced by the relative closeness of the Carolingian Empire; objects crafted there have occasionally been found. Poland was populated by many tribes of various sizes. The names of some of them, mostly from {{the western part of the}} country, are known from written sources, <b>especially</b> <b>a</b> Latin document written in the mid-9th century by the anonymous Bavarian Geographer. During this period, smaller tribal structures were disintegrating while larger ones were being established in their place.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} since its release, modern film {{scholars}} {{have noted the}} possible homosexual reading of the film. Director James Whale was openly gay, {{and some of the}} actors in the cast, including Ernest Thesiger and Colin Clive, were believed to be gay or bisexual. Although James Curtis, Whale's biographer, rejects the notion that Whale would have identified with the Monster from a homosexual perspective, scholars have perceived a gay subtext suffused through the film, <b>especially</b> <b>a</b> camp sensibility, particularly embodied in the character of Pretorius and his relationship with Henry.|$|E
5|$|John Shaw {{and other}} historians, {{military}} and civilian, have based {{the conclusions of}} their work on the incursion {{on the premise that}} the North Vietnamese logistical system in Cambodia had been so badly damaged that it was rendered ineffective. The next large-scale North Vietnamese offensive, the Nguyen Hue Offensive of 1972 (called the Easter Offensive in the West) would be launched out of southern North Vietnam and western Laos, not from Cambodia, was cited as proof positive that the Cambodian operations had succeeded. The fact that PAVN forces were otherwise occupied in Cambodia and had no such offensive plan (so far as is known) was seemingly irrelevant. The fact that logistically, a northern offensive (<b>especially</b> <b>a</b> conventional one backed by armour and heavy artillery) would be launched closer to its source of manpower and supply also seemed to be of little consequence.|$|E

She listened to the song with Madonna a number of times and together decided to include the ecstasy part. A sub-plot about Madonna as a homicide witness was included, which became the trigger for the sexual and religious ecstasy. Actor Leon Robinson was hired {{to play the role of}} a saint; the part was inspired by Martin de Porres, the patron saint of mixed-race people and all those seeking interracial harmony.|$|E
5|$|Other {{problems}} faced by the ZNG included a shortage of trained officers, inadequate troop training, a shortage of weapons and <b>especially</b> <b>a</b> shortage of ammunition. Mobilisation proved particularly successful, however, and troops were plentiful; in Zagreb, approximately 80 percent of those called up in September and October reported for service. The ZNG were short of uniforms; 20 percent of those drafted in Zagreb during this period received uniforms, while the remainder fought in civilian clothes. The ZNG also relied on the civilian infrastructure for food, fuel and medical care.|$|E

5|$|The coffeehouse {{became a}} popular place to debate ideas, with growing {{literacy}} {{and the development}} of the printing press making news widely available; and Fleet Street became the centre of the British press. Following the invasion of Amsterdam by Napoleonic armies, many financiers relocated to London, <b>especially</b> <b>a</b> large Jewish community, and the first London international issue was arranged in 1817. Around the same time, the Royal Navy became the world leading war fleet, acting as a serious deterrent to potential economic adversaries of the United Kingdom. The repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 was specifically aimed at weakening Dutch economic power. London then overtook Amsterdam as the leading international financial centre.|$|E
5|$|The {{music of}} Saint Lucia {{is home to}} many vibrant oral and folk traditions {{and is based on}} {{elements}} derived from the music of Africa, especially rhythmically, and Western Europe, dances like the quadrille, polka and waltz. The banjo and cuatro are iconic Lucian folk instruments, <b>especially</b> <b>a</b> four-stringed banjo called the bwa poye. Celebratory songs called jwé show lyricism, and rhythmic complexity. The most important of the Afro-Lucian Creole folk dances is the kwadril. Music {{is an integral part of}} Lucian folk holidays and celebrations, as well as the good-natured rivalry between the La Rose and La Marguerite societies. There is little Western classical music on Saint Lucia, and the country's popular music industry is only nascent. There are few recording opportunities, though live music and radio remain a vital part of Lucian culture. Popular music from abroad, especially Trinidadian styles like calypso and soca, is widespread.|$|E

5|$|The name Crewkerne {{is thought}} to be derived from Cruc-aera; from the British cruc - a spur of a hill, and the Old English aera - a house, <b>especially</b> <b>a</b> storehouse. The town was known as Crocern, or Cruaern in the 899 will of Alfred the Great when he left it to his younger son Æthelweard, and by 1066 the manor was held by Edith Swanneck {{mistress}} of King Harold. After the Norman conquest it was held by William the Conqueror and the church estate was given to the Abbaye-aux-Hommes in Caen, Normandy. In the Domesday Survey of 1086 it was described as a royal manor.|$|E
5|$|With {{knowledge}} of his sexuality becoming more common beginning in the 1970s, some film historians and gay studies scholars have detected homosexual themes in Whale's work, particularly in Bride of Frankenstein in which {{a number of the}} creative people associated with the cast, including Ernest Thesiger and Colin Clive, were alleged to be gay or bisexual. Scholars have identified a gay sensibility suffused through the film, <b>especially</b> <b>a</b> camp sensibility, particularly embodied in the character of Pretorius (Thesiger) and his relationship with Henry Frankenstein (Clive).|$|E
5|$|De Broglie's {{prediction}} {{of a wave}} nature for electrons led Erwin Schrödinger to postulate a wave equation for electrons moving {{under the influence of}} the nucleus in the atom. In 1926, this equation, the Schrödinger equation, successfully described how electron waves propagated. Rather than yielding a solution that determined the location of an electron over time, this wave equation also could be used to predict the probability of finding an electron near a position, <b>especially</b> <b>a</b> position near where the electron was bound in space, for which the electron wave equations did not change in time. This approach led to a second formulation of quantum mechanics (the first by Heisenberg in 1925), and solutions of Schrödinger's equation, like Heisenberg's, provided derivations of the energy states of an electron in a hydrogen atom that were equivalent to those that had been derived first by Bohr in 1913, and that were known to reproduce the hydrogen spectrum. Once spin and the interaction between multiple electrons were describable, quantum mechanics made it possible to predict the configuration of electrons in atoms with atomic numbers greater than hydrogen.|$|E
