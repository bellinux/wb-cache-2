5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s Chatwin {{had an affair}} with James Ivory, a film director. He pitched stories to him for {{possible}} films, which Ivory did not take seriously. In 1972 Chatwin tried <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> film-making and travelled to Niger to make a documentary about nomads. The film was lost while Chatwin was trying to sell it to European television companies.|$|E

Washington returned to New York City {{after only a}} period of about a year in Guatemala, and then began pursuing the main part of his career in coffee manufacture. His father remained in Guatemala and died there in 1912.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{majority}} of his works were in Polish, he tried <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> several works in French language (Le roi de Landawa, Beatrice Cenci). Many of his works were published only posthumously, often under arbitrary titles, as Słowacki never named them himself. He also left notes on works that he never began or never completed. Słowacki is also considered the father of modern Polish drama.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, Miloš's {{descendant}} King Alexander visited Jovanović at his Vienna {{studio and}} requested {{a painting of}} the revolt to commemorate its 75th anniversary. With his rise in stature, the artist had found himself producing numerous replicas of his earlier Orientalist works. According to biographer Nikola Kusovac, Jovanović grew bored with painting replicas and considered taking up a different genre. Alexander's request presented Jovanović {{with an opportunity to}} deviate from Orientalism and try <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> history painting. The Takovo Uprising was his first historical composition.|$|E
5|$|Living {{alone in}} Mysore, Narayan {{developed}} {{an interest in}} agriculture. He bought an acre of agricultural land and tried <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> farming. He was also prone to walking to the market every afternoon, {{not so much for}} buying things, but to interact with the people. In a typical afternoon stroll, he would stop every few steps to greet and converse with shopkeepers and others, most likely gathering material for his next book.|$|E

5|$|Sherman's San Francisco branch {{closed in}} May 1857, and he {{relocated}} to New York {{on behalf of}} the same bank. When the bank failed during the financial Panic of 1857, he closed the New York branch. In early 1858, he returned to California to wrap-up the bank's affairs there. Later in 1858, he moved to Leavenworth, Kansas, where he tried <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> law practice and other ventures without much success.|$|E
5|$|The Serbian {{poet and}} writer Desanka Maksimović wrote {{a poem about}} the {{massacre}} titled Krvava bajka ("A Bloody Fairy Tale"). The poem was later included in the Yugoslav secondary school curriculum and schoolchildren were required to memorise it. In 1965, the Belgian poet Karel Jonckheere wrote the poem Kinderen met krekelstem ("Children with Cricket Voices"), also about the massacre. The Blue Butterfly, a book of poetry by Richard Berengarten, {{is based on the}} poet's experiences while visiting Kragujevac in 1985, when a blue butterfly landed on <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> the entrance to the memorial museum.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{resignation}} in 1926 to allow Margaret Bondfield {{to take a}} seat in Parliament, Hastings returned to {{his work as a}} barrister, and was even more successful than before his entry into the House of Commons. His cases included the Savidge Inquiry and the Royal Mail Case, and before his full retirement in 1948 {{he was one of the}} highest paid barristers at the English Bar. As well as his legal work, Hastings also tried <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> writing plays. Although these had a mixed reception, The River was made into a silent film in 1927 named The Notorious Lady. Following strokes in 1948 and 1949, his activities became heavily restricted, and he died at home on 26 February 1952.|$|E
5|$|He practiced at the Bhiwani Boxing Club, where former national-level boxer and Jagdish Singh {{recognised}} his talent. Working part-time, he {{even tried}} <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> modelling to financially support his coaching. The first recognition for Vijender {{came when he}} won a bout in the state level competition. Vijender won a silver medal in his first sub-junior nationals in 1997 {{and went on to}} bag his first gold medal at the 2000 Nationals. In 2003, he became the all-India youth boxing champion. The turning point, however, came in the 2003 Afro-Asian Games. Despite being a junior boxer, Vijender took part in the selection trials and was picked for the meet where he fought valiantly to win a silver medal.|$|E
5|$|In America, {{he again}} tried <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> journalism, but a brief stint {{as editor of}} the New Yorker Yiddishe Ilustrirte Zaitung {{resulted}} only in getting the paper suspended and landing himself a rather large fine. On March 31, 1905, he recited poetry at a benefit performance at Cooper Union to raise a pension for Yiddish poet Eliakum Zunser, even worse off than himself because he had found himself unable to write since coming to America in 1889. Shortly afterwards, he met a group of young people who had a Hebrew language association at the Dr. Herzl Zion Club, and wrote a Hebrew-language play David ba-Milchama (David in the War), which they performed in March 1906, the first Hebrew-language play to be performed in America. Repeat performances in March 1907 and April 1908 drew successively larger crowds.|$|E

5|$|James and comedian Jimmy Kimmel co-{{hosted the}} 2007 ESPY Awards. In other comedic pursuits, he hosted the 33rd-season premiere of Saturday Night Live. He has also tried <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> acting, {{appearing}} in a cameo {{role on the}} HBO series Entourage. In 2015, he played himself in the Judd Apatow film Trainwreck, receiving positive reviews for his performance. That same year, James' digital video company, Uninterrupted, raised $15.8 million from Warner Bros. Entertainment and Turner Sports to help expand the company's efforts to bring athlete-created content to fans. It is hosted on Bleacher Report and is used by several other athletes including New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski and Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy was {{admitted}} to the Massachusetts Bar in 1959. In 1960, his brother John ran for President of the United States and Ted managed his campaign in the Western states. Ted learned to fly and during the Democratic primary campaign he barnstormed around the western states, meeting with delegates and bonding with them by trying <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> ski jumping and bronc riding. The seven weeks he spent in Wisconsin helped his brother win the first contested primary of the season there and a similar time spent in Wyoming was rewarded when a unanimous vote from that state's delegates put his brother over the top at the 1960 Democratic National Convention.|$|E
5|$|Miles, {{who just}} wants a normal life, is unhappy about having these abilities, and {{initially}} nauseated {{at the idea}} of risking his life to engage in superheroics, a reaction that Bendis wrote to further contrast Miles with Parker. However, after witnessing Spider-Man's death {{at the hands of the}} Green Goblin, the guilt-ridden Miles realizes he could have helped. After Ganke suggests he assume the mantle of Spider-Man, and learns from Gwen Stacy why Parker did what he did, Miles is inspired to try <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> costumed crimefighting. During his first foray into costumed superheroics, he is confronted not only by those who feel his use of the Spider-Man costume is in bad taste, but also by Spider-Woman, a member of the government superhuman team, the Ultimates, over his use of the Spider-Man identity.|$|E

5|$|Partly from Cowper's {{literary}} influence, {{and partly}} because learned vicars were expected to write verses, Newton began to try <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> hymns, which had become popular through the language, made plain for common people to understand. Several prolific hymn writers were at their most productive in the 18th century, including Isaac Watts whose hymns Newton had grown up hearing and Charles Wesley, with whom Newton was familiar. Wesley's brother John, the eventual founder of the Methodist Church, had encouraged Newton {{to go into the}} clergy. Watts was a pioneer in English hymn writing, basing his work after the Psalms. The most prevalent hymns by Watts and others were written in the common meter in 8.6.8.6: the first line is eight syllables and the second is six.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{his work}} as a barrister, Hastings also tried <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> writing plays. His first play was The Moscow Doctor, based on a novel by Seton Merriman which he had rewritten; it ran for over a week in Brighton. He desired to have an {{original}} work performed, however, and to this end wrote The River over a period of 20 years before taking it to St James's Theatre, where it was accepted and performed in June 1925. The play starred Owen Nares and initially went well, but foundered in the second act due to the plot requiring the most popular actors to be taken off stage - the character played by Nares, for example, broke his leg. Reviews compared the plot to something out of the Boy's Own Paper. The play lasted only a month before being cancelled, but Hastings was able to sell the film rights for £2,000, and it was turned into a Hollywood film called The Notorious Lady starring Lewis Stone and Barbara Bedford.|$|E
5|$|Bolstered {{by some of}} his successes, in 1940 Narayan tried <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> a journal, Indian Thought. With {{the help}} of his uncle, a car salesman, Narayan managed to get more than a {{thousand}} subscribers in Madras city alone. However, the venture did not last long due to Narayan's inability to manage it, and it ceased publication within a year. His first collection of short stories, Malgudi Days, was published in November 1942, followed by The English Teacher in 1945. In between, being cut off from England due to the war, Narayan started his own publishing company, naming it (again) Indian Thought Publications; the publishing company was a success and is still active, now managed by his granddaughter. Soon, with a devoted readership stretching from New York to Moscow, Narayan's books started selling well and in 1948 he started building his own house on the outskirts of Mysore; the house was completed in 1953. Around this period, Narayan wrote the screenplay for the Gemini Studios film Miss Malini (1947), which remained the only screenplay by him that was successfully adapted into a feature film.|$|E
