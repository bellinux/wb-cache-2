40|$|This thesis {{aimed to}} gain more {{insights}} into <b>works</b> <b>council</b> effectiveness in two ways: 1. studying the influence of <b>works</b> <b>council</b> presence on organizational outcomes; and, 2. studying the determinants of <b>works</b> <b>council</b> effectiveness. We found that productivity increases {{with the presence of}} a <b>works</b> <b>council.</b> <b>Works</b> <b>councils</b> in smaller organizations (less than 50 employees), have a positive effect in reorganizations without layoffs. Creating acceptance for reorganizations, can lead to understanding among employees. In reorganizations with layoffs, <b>works</b> <b>council</b> presence is negatively related to productivity in small organizations. Layoffs may signal to employees that the <b>works</b> <b>council</b> did not do its best to prevent bad consequences for the employees, and that it is siding with management. Our study of <b>works</b> <b>council</b> effects on labor turnover revealed that in good times, <b>works</b> <b>council</b> presence does not affect voluntary quits, and is associated with more hires and layoffs. In bad times, in organizations with a <b>works</b> <b>council,</b> more voluntary quits are reported, hires are not affected, and less involuntary quits occur. <b>Works</b> <b>councils</b> might thus place the organizational interests above employee interests in good economic times, and the other way around in bad economic times. We employed an experimental design {{to gain more}} insights into the fundamental processes underlying <b>works</b> <b>council</b> advice. Managers had to choose to set a low or high price for their products. Part of the managers received an advice from a <b>works</b> <b>council,</b> advising high or low. Managers only follow the <b>works</b> <b>council</b> advice when it is in line with playing Nash (choosing “low”). This reflects the conflict of interests that exists between management and works councils; if the goals are more aligned, cooperation is more likely to occur. Furthermore, prosocial managers tended to follow the advice of <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> more often. They even chose a high price when the <b>works</b> <b>council</b> advised to play a low price. These results support earlier research, suggesting that a favorable attitude towards the <b>works</b> <b>council</b> often leads to more effective <b>works</b> <b>councils.</b> We found that the position in the organizational social network did not show positive effects for the <b>works</b> <b>council</b> members. Influence tactics used by the works councilors were more important, and mostly regarding influence towards management. These influence tactics for example include behaving rationally, and searching for support from persons higher in the organization. To come to a more integrative model of <b>works</b> <b>council</b> effectiveness, combining determinants and outcomes, we conducted case study research. We found support for some of our earlier findings, and we identified new important determinants of <b>works</b> <b>council</b> influence. Management attitude was again identified as one of the crucial elements affecting <b>works</b> <b>council</b> influence. Further, influence tactics are important. Relations with management, as well as relations with employees and internally, are important determinants of <b>works</b> <b>council</b> influence.

40|$|German <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> have {{experienced}} a growing importance in recent years. They are endowed with numerous opportunities of participation ranging from simple information rights to extensive codetermination rights according to the Works Constitution Act (WCA). Since they are mandatory but not automatic, the initiative of the employees is necessary to install a <b>works</b> <b>council</b> in firms with five or more permanent employees. <b>Works</b> <b>councils</b> are committed to improve working relationships and thus they may also increase firm performance. Not without reason <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> {{can be regarded as}} a central element of the industrial democratization. Due to their direct contact with the employees of a firm, they seem to be better suited to represent employees’ interests towards the management of a firm. Nevertheless, most of the previous studies with regards to works councils’ economic effects examine issue such as productivity, innovations or profitability which are of particular interest for the management of a firm. This dissertation aims to counter this problem by providing comprehensive analyses concerning the employee level. At first, the focus is laid on the relationship between <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> and the incidence of both overtime work and working time accounts. Based on the GSOEP, a yearly representative longitudinal survey of individuals living in Germany, the main results show that <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> are negatively correlated with the existence of overtime work. This can in particular be pronounced for men and unskilled and semi-skilled blue collar workers. In addition, <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> are negatively related to the number of overtime hours. Concerning subgroups of employees, <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> are associated with a reduced number of overtime hours of both men and white collar workers. While both paid and unpaid overtime work is less likely for employees with a <b>works</b> <b>council,</b> time-off or a combination of time-off and paid overtime work is more likely in such firms. Turning to flexible working time accounts as an important instrument of flexibility within a workplace, empirical results show a positive correlation between a <b>works</b> <b>council</b> and such accounts. But the incidence of long-term working time accounts is negatively associated with the presence of a <b>works</b> <b>council.</b> Taking the problem of unobserved heterogeneity and additional selection issues into account, women moving to a firm with a <b>works</b> <b>council</b> actually <b>work</b> fewer hours than in their previous position. However, further difference-in-differences estimations do not find a <b>works</b> <b>council’s</b> effect on overtime work or overtime hours as well as on individual working time accounts for both stayer and mover. Then, the association between <b>works</b> <b>councils,</b> wages and job satisfaction is investigated. This study provides empirical evidence that <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> are associated with higher wages and a reduced gender wage differential. Moreover, <b>works</b> <b>council</b> are not correlated with employees’ job satisfaction in general. While they are negatively associated with job satisfaction of white collar workers, <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> are positively associated with job satisfaction of blue collar workers. Taking the issue of causality into account, a significant effect of a change in the <b>works</b> <b>council</b> status on wages cannot be shown. However, further difference-in-difference estimations hint at a positive effect on job satisfaction. This result is more pronounced for women than for men. The effect is rather driven by employees who move to a different firm during the observation period. Particular effects of an introduction of a <b>works</b> <b>council</b> for individuals who stay at their firm are not observable. Particular effects for blue collar workers compared to white collar employees cannot be found, either. Finally, the relation between <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> and employment separations as well as severance payments is focused on. Empirical results show that the existence of a <b>works</b> <b>council</b> is negatively associated with both individual dismissals and voluntary quits. Hence, results from previous studies can be confirmed. <b>Works</b> <b>councils</b> particularly favor men as well as qualified employees. In contrast, results with respect to <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> and severance payments are not as expected. <b>Works</b> <b>councils</b> are negatively associated with severance payments for dismissed employees. Dismissed men as well as white collar worker with simple tasks are affected in particular. These results indicate that the behavior of both <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> and employees due to a dismissal may be a crucial factor in explaining who receives a severance payment at all...|$|R

Moreover, <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> are challenged by a partial decentralisation of collective bargaining towards the establishment level dissolving the established division of labour between <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> and trade unions. These new challenges confront <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> with risks of structural overcharge endangering their institutional stability. Institutional learning may increase the institutional capabilities and competences required to <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> in order to meet new challenges. It could focus on a critical reflection of established practises in interest representation, utilising workforce diversity as a social resource of interest representation and promote co-operation between <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> in network companies or multinationals. However, <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> are not capable of meeting new challenges self-destined, rather they still depend on a supportive infrastructure of advice and consultancy provided by trade unions. In order to offer support tailored to the needs of <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> and to overcome their crisis in respect to social legitimacy trade unions will as well have to undergo processes of institutional learning to enhance their regional capacities of action, to promote innovative ideas or social issues and to utilise the increased workforce diversity as a starting point to attract new target groups of potential union members.

On the other hand, strong effects of relational predictors would lend support to trust as a relational phenomenon. The data show that trust in management among <b>works</b> <b>council</b> members is related to relational rather than instrumental antecedents...|$|R
30|$|German MNCs global CPS adoption, {{globalization}} induced internal {{shifts in}} competence allocation and new lower wage capacity subcontractors inside Germany all pose interesting {{challenges for the}} German co-determination and industrial relations systems, on the one hand, and for regional and national industrial policy players on the other. Take first co-determination and industrial relations. In the large firms Herrigel et al. (2014) studied, the degree of <b>works</b> <b>council</b> involvement in the CPS system varied significantly. The large south German Truck and Omnibus Transmission producer had the most elaborate <b>works</b> <b>council</b> integration model. The company established an independent and whole concern agreement with the <b>works</b> <b>council</b> that mandated <b>works</b> <b>council</b> participation in relevant stakeholder teams. In other words, <b>works</b> <b>council</b> social and training expertise was directly solicited in the team deliberations within the firm regarding process optimization, product development, knowledge transfer, and recursive competence shifts induced by globalization. Similarly, at a Southwest German power drive manufacturer, a CIT team pioneer, CIT team members were active participants in the company <b>works</b> <b>council,</b> and the <b>works</b> <b>council</b> was a stakeholder in numerous CPS structured deliberation processes involving product development and production optimization.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} differences in employment growth between firms {{with and without}} <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> by separating introduction effects from potential selectivity effects. Using a difference in differences framework, we show that firms with <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> have higher employment growth before establishing a <b>works</b> <b>council.</b> However, employment growth declines after introduction. We identify the reason for lower employment growth in reduced hiring rates but constant dismissal rates...|$|R
