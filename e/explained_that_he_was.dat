Jackalow protested his innocence to the reporter and <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> Japanese, from the Ryukyu Islands.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Del Arco had {{no concept}} of what a Borg was prior to the audition. He {{received}} his script on the evening prior to meeting with the producers and felt that {{it gave him a}} decent sense of the character. Instead, Del Arco later <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> deliberately anti-social towards the other actors at the audition in order to get into Hugh's mindset. When he performed for the producers, someone else read the lines assigned to Picard and La Forge, and he felt like he immediately got a positive result. He received a call back, and returned to audition once more.|$|E

5|$|KFC popularized {{chicken in}} the fast food industry, diversifying the market by {{challenging}} the established dominance of the hamburger. In 1960 the company had around 200 franchised restaurants; by 1963 this had grown to over 600, making it the largest fast food operation in the United States. In 1963, Sanders met John Y. Brown, Jr, a young Kentucky encyclopaedia salesman, who <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> keen to join the company. Sanders instead proposed {{the sale of the}} company, as business skills did not come naturally to him, and he lacked an obvious or willing heir among his relatives.|$|E
5|$|Similarities between House and {{the famous}} fictional detective Sherlock Holmes appear in the pilot; Shore <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> always a fan of Holmes, and found the character's traits of {{indifference}} to his clients unique. House and Holmes have only one real friend (Wilson and Watson, respectively) who connects the cerebral hero to human concerns. This Holmes and Watson dynamic was something the producers were looking for in the characters of House and Wilson, {{especially in terms of}} chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Curtis, {{with the}} backing of Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, {{rejected}} the Storrow Commission's proposal. He proceeded with department trials of the 19 and on September 8 found them guilty of union activity. Rather than dismiss them from the police force, he extended their suspensions. He later <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> giving them an opportunity to reconsider their actions and avoid discharges, which would have been irrevocable. The police union members responded that same day by voting 1134 to 2 in favor of a strike and scheduled it to start at evening roll call the next day. Their stated grounds omitted wages and working conditions. They said the strike's rationale was to protest the Commissioner's denial of their right to ally themselves with the AFL.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Manheim recovers {{long enough}} to <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing {{experiments}} involving time, gravity, and funnels to other universes, and suspects his last experiment {{is running out of}} control. Manheim <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> trapped between two dimensions and Data determines that the experiment must be shut down during a time fluctuation or else it will simply grow larger. Manheim provides the crew with the correct coordinates to beam down to avoid the security fields. Picard admits to Jenice <b>that</b> <b>he</b> worried about losing her again after he left her in Paris, and vows to correct Dr. Manheim's experiment.|$|R
5|$|Smith gave an {{interview}} to the Columbia newspaper The State about his book and his interest in researching {{the history of the}} Central Intelligence Agency. He <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> long interested in researching military history, and was initially asked by the American Society of Journalists and Authors to put together a monograph on the 1944 Invasion of Normandy by Western Allied forces during Operation Overlord in World War II. His literary representative later telephoned him to ask if he would instead be interested in writing an encyclopedia detailing the history of the CIA. Smith agreed as he felt the CIA was highly relevant to military history.|$|E
5|$|Skelton was a Freemason, {{a member}} of Vincennes Lodge No. 1, in Indiana. He also was {{a member of}} both the Scottish and York Rite. He was a {{recipient}} of the Gold Medal of the General Grand Chapter, Royal Arch Masons, for Distinguished Service in the Arts and Sciences. On September 24, 1969, he received the honorary 33rd degree in the Scottish Rite and was a Gourgas Medal recipient in 1995. Skelton became interested in Masonry as a small boy selling newspapers in Vincennes, when a man bought a paper from him with a five dollar bill and told him to keep the change. The young Skelton asked his benefactor why he had given him so much money; the man <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a Mason and Masons are taught to give. Skelton decided to become one also when he was grown. He was also member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, as well as a Shriner in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|The prompt {{accomplishments of}} the Allied Translator and Interpreter Section and Mashbir's {{executive}} ability resulted in Mashbir being promoted to full colonel by General Douglas MacArthur after only one month. Mashbir then joined the forefront of MacArthur's intelligence activities and Japanese surrender negotiations, remaining the Commandant of ATIS until December 1945. He was made famous {{at the time in}} the motion picture and still photograph of the preliminary surrender negotiations at Manila, as the man who pushed the ink-well, indicating that General Richard K. Sutherland should correct the Japanese Instrument of Surrender; and also as the man who thumbed the Japanese Lieutenant General Torashir≈ç Kawabe along as he attempted to shake hands. The second incident provoked some mixed feelings, including sentiment that it could have damaged surrender talks. Mashbir also played a critical role retrieving and translating the Z Plan and in organizing the final surrender of Japan. In his autobiography, Mashbir <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not permitted to shake hands, and {{that it would have been}} rude to point, which ultimately lead to the awkward thumbing motion that was photographed.|$|E

5|$|The second main feud {{heading into}} the event was between Kane and Shawn Michaels. This feud began the night after Bad Blood, when Michaels lost a Hell in a Cell match to Triple H. Raw {{commentator}} Jim Ross tried making amends between Michaels and Triple H by making them to shake hands. Michaels and Triple H extended their hands to shake, however, Kane came out and attacked Michaels, which resulted in Kane, in storyline, crushing Michaels' throat with a wedged chair. Michaels was then taken out in an ambulance for medical attention. On the June 28, 2004 edition of Raw, Ross interviewed Kane {{and asked him to}} explain his actions towards Michaels; Kane <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> robbed of the World Heavyweight Championship at Bad Blood against Chris Benoit, as Michaels got in his way, which angered him. On the August 30 edition of Raw, Kane revealed that Eric Bischoff's wedding gift to him and Lita, who married the week before, was to name any match he wanted for the September pay-per-view, Unforgiven. Lita then informed Kane that Bischoff's present was for both of them, where they were able to pick Kane's opponent for Unforgiven, which resulted in Michaels being picked.|$|E
5|$|Uttanka {{wanted to}} give the sage his gurudakshina. The guru told him to meet his wife Ahalya and inquire as to her wish. Ahalya {{suggested}} that he bring her the divine earrings of Madayanti, King Mitrasaha Saudasa's wife, as gurudakshina. The king had turned into a cannibalistic rakshasa by a curse and was known as Kalmashapada. Uttanka met Kalmashapada, who approached Uttanka to eat him, but Uttanka stopped him and <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> duty-bound to get Madayanti's earrings as gurudakshina and that he, Uttanka, would return to Kalmashapada after fulfilling his obligation. Kalmashapada agreed and directed him to his wife, who refused to part with her earrings until Uttanka brought some token from Kalmashapada as proof of his consent. Upon returning from Kalmashapada with a token, Madayanti gave him the earrings. The queen warned Uttanka that her earrings were coveted by Nagas, Yakshas, rakshasas and the gods, who would try to steal them. Uttanka was therefore advised not to allow the earrings to touch the ground to prevent the snakes from taking possession of them.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} weeks {{of the year in}} Albania, there was no {{fighting}} since the Ottomans did not normally engage in battle during the winter. But Kruj√´ was still under siege and Ottoman garrisons in other areas remained. Life became harder for the population after the destruction of crops and villages and the masses of refugees. By November 22, news came to Venice about the campaigns of Sinan bey against Albania Veneta in order to pressure the Republic to accept a peace or a ceasefire. The Signoria was slow {{to come to terms with}} Mehmed due to the pressure put on it by Pope Paul, Hungary, and Naples to remain at war. The attempt to sway the Venetians failed and the campaign was cancelled. This had an adverse effect for the Ottomans since Lek√´ Dukagjini, Skanderbeg's ally in northern Albania, decided to work without reservation with Skanderbeg against the Ottomans. In Rome, the pope continued to hold Skanderbeg and would only give him 300 ducats to support his stay. On Christmas Eve, Paul invited Skanderbeg to a ceremony where he was awarded with a sword and helmet and referred to him as Alexander, king of the Epirotes. By 7 January 1467, a consistory convened where Skanderbeg and the pope were present. According to Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga, the pope's appeal to fund Skanderbeg with only 5,000 ducats was heard and when the Cardinals responded that the fund was minimal, Paul explained that he would send more once Italy was pacified. Paul's decision led to a fierce debate on Italy's future which left Albania's fate undiscussed. A second consistory was called on 12 January but did not result in anything favorable for Skanderbeg. Contemporaries were critical of the pope's delays but he <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> waiting to see what Ferdinand of Naples was willing to offer before offering anything himself, in order not to waste funds.|$|E

5000|$|Leonard Pine is Hap's best friend, a gay {{black man}} from Texas (later novels {{explicitly}} reveal <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a Republican, {{which is only}} hinted at in this novel). His backstory is not touched upon in Savage Season, except to <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{a veteran of the}} Vietnam War. Later novels <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> raised alternately by his grandmother (who taught him various social values) and his uncle (who taught him how to fight and [...] "be a man", and later rejected him for revealing his homosexuality). Leonard has few friends other than Hap because of his violent temper, preferring the company of his many dogs.|$|R

25|$|Some of {{the early}} manuals about mental {{disorders}} were created by the Greeks. In the 4th century BCE, Hippocrates theorized that physiological abnormalities may be the root of mental disorders. In 4th to 5th Century B.C. Greece, Hippocrates wrote that he visited Democritus and found him in his garden cutting open animals.

That was the last thing Tobares said to Ver√≥nica.|$|E
