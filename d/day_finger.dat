G×E interaction analysis of grain yield in AMMI (Additive Main and Multiplicative Interaction) model showed differential interaction of the genotypes in the 3 planting conditions. IPCA- 1 explained 93 % of G×E interaction. AMMI G×E interaction study showed that OEB 56, OEB 71 and VR 822 had high mean and positive interaction, while PES 110 had high mean and very low interaction. On basis of AMMI II predicted yield, the genotypes OEB 56 and OEB 71 were better suited for early transplanting at Bhubaneswar and early direct-sown condition at Berhampur indicating that the genotype would be suitable for early cropping, but not late cropping. The genotype PES 110 showed better adaptation to both early and late transplanting conditions at Bhubaneswar, indicating that the genotype is suitable for transplanting condition and not for direct-sown condition. Six other genotypes showed specific adaptation to single environment only, of which Chilika ranked first under late transplanting at Bhubaneswar and VR 822 ranked first under early directsown condition at Berhampur, indicating specific adaptation.

40|$|Almost {{half of the}} world’s {{population}} {{are at risk of}} malaria infection, and the disease kills more than one million people each year, mainly {{children under the age of}} five years living in sub-Saharan Africa. More than one-quarter of the world’s {{population are}} affected by schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis and approximately 300 million people suffer from associated morbidity. Recent estimates suggest that each year schistosomiasis alone causes more than 200, 000 deaths due to kidney dysfunction and haematemesis in sub- Saharan Africa. Amoebiasis, a disease caused by the intestinal protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica, kills 40, 000 - 100, 000 people each year. An estimated 200 million people are currently infected with Giardia duodenalis, another intestinal protozoan infection, which can cause severe disease especially in children. The above-mentioned diseases are particularly prevalent in developing countries, especially in the poorest segments of rural communities. Underlying risk factors are lack of access to clean water and improved sanitation, inadequate hygiene behaviour, and lack of access to sound preventive measures and effective treatment. Because several of these parasitic infections are often prevalent in the same regions, it follows that people can harbour multiple parasite species infections concurrently. Individuals with multiple parasite infections are at an elevated risk of morbidity, hence the appraisal of the extent of this phenomenon and the underlying risk factors of single and multiple infections is important for the design and implementation of control strategies. The overarching goal of this thesis was to enhance our understanding of demographic, ecological, environmental and socio-economic factors that influence disease distribution in space in the region of Man, western Côte d’Ivoire. This knowledge base will facilitate the creation of risk maps and predictions of parasitic infections. For this purpose two different studies, namely (i) a community-based study in a single village with participants of all age groups and (ii) a regional school-based study with more than 4, 000 schoolchildren, were carried out. The community-based survey was conducted in May-June 2002 in the village of Zouatta II. There, we first conducted a demographic survey among 561 individuals of 75 randomly selected households. Name, age and sex of household members were recorded, as well as the geographical coordinates of their houses. Then, we carried out a rigorous parasitological survey. From each study participant, stool samples were collected on three consecutive days. On the third <b>day,</b> <b>finger</b> prick blood samples were collected from each participant and thin and thick blood films were prepared. Stool and blood samples were analysed with standardized quality-controlled, methods for diagnosis of parasitic infections. The stool samples were processed with the Kato-Katz technique for the identification of Schistosoma mansoni and soil-transmitted helminth eggs (hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura). The formalin concentration method was employed for the identification of intestinal protozoa cysts or trophozoites, including E. histolytica/E. dispar and G. duodenalis. Thin and thick blood films were stained with Giemsa and analysed by light microscopy for Plasmodium infections. In parallel, a questionnaire survey for the appraisal of perceived morbidity indicators was carried out among the same household members. In the regional school-based study, demographic data, i. e. age and sex of all schoolchildren attending grades 3 - 5, were obtained from official class lists in the school year of 2001 / 2002. First, a cross-sectional parasitological survey was carried out among more than 4, 000 schoolchildren from 57 rural schools. From each child single stool and blood samples were collected and processed according to the same standardized, quality-controlled, methods mentioned above. Subsequently, a questionnaire survey was carried out for appraisal of selfreported morbidity indicators and schoolchildren’s socio-economic status. Questionnaires included 17 morbidity indicators and 12 household assets. Finally, a comprehensive geographical information system for the region of Man, including environmental data obtained from satellite imagery and digitised maps, was established. The results of the community-based parasitological survey confirmed that several parasitic diseases were common among rural dwellers of western Côte d’Ivoire, with all age groups concerned. The prevalences of P. falciparum, hookworm, E. histolytica/E. dispar and S. mansoni were 76. 4...|$|E

30|$|All {{participants}} were asked to refrain from physical exercise, alcohol, and supplement consumption 24  h before blood retrieval [18, 29]. All women were enrolled randomly with respect to menstrual cycle, but menstruation bleeding days were avoided (days 1 – 7 of menstrual cycle), because contraceptive pill dosage consists of discontinuation of drug or placebo use in these <b>days.</b> <b>Finger</b> capillary blood samples were obtained in duplicate (within 20  min apart) for each measured parameter from seated and 12  h fasting subjects in the morning (between 8 and 10 am) [30]. Personnel performing the collection and measurement of samples were blinded to clinical, demographic, and habit data. Reactive oxygen species, in the form of hydroperoxides (considered to represent blood lipid hydroperoxides [30]), were determined as previously described [30] in 20  μL of capillary blood using the free oxygen radical test (FORT assay; Callegari, Parma, Italy), a 6 -min long colorimetric assay based on the ability of transition metals to catalyze the breakdown of hydroperoxides (ROOH) into radicals, according to the Fenton reaction. Results were expressed as FORT units, whereby 1 FORT unit corresponded to 0.26  mg/L H 2 O 2 [30]. The intra- and inter-assay variations were < 4.5 and < 5.0  %, respectively. Detection limits of the assay were ≤ 160 and ≥ 600 FORT units. Stratification of hydroperoxides was performed by the threshold of 310 FORT units as high level, and of 400 FORT units attesting very high levels of oxidative stress [31].|$|R

After many studies, they found a new and high potential plant-based drug named stevia that is able to reduce diabetic patients’ blood glucose. This study aimed {{to determine the effect}} of stevia on blood glucose of healthy subjects. The study was carried out by comparing the glycemic response between sucrose and stevia (500 and 1000 mg) among 32 subjects aged between 18 and 23 years old. Subjects were required to fast 8 to 10 h prior to each test which was done on different <b>days.</b> <b>Finger</b> prick test were done on 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min to construct a blood sugar response curve for 2 h period. There is {{a significant difference between the}} glycemic response of sucrose and stevia 500 mg. Sucrose significantly increased the post prandial blood glucose while stevia 500 mg reduced blood glucose after 30 min of consumption. Sucrose also produced higher glycemic response at min- 30 when compared with stevia 1000 mg. There is no significant difference between the glycemic response of stevia of different dose, 500 and 1000 mg. No dose-dependent effect was observed in this study. In conclusion, stevia does not raise blood glucose significantly when consumed in short period. Stevia is effective to be used by healthy people to maintain blood glucose even when consumed in short length of time...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION HIV-infected {{patients}} require antiretroviral {{treatment for}} life. To improve access to care, CD 4 enumeration and viral load tests have been redesigned {{to be used}} as point-of-care techniques using finger-stick blood. Accurate CD 4 counting in capillary blood requires a free flowing blood drop that is achieved by blade incision. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the attitude of the patients toward blade-based finger-stick blood donation. METHODS Four hundred and ninety-nine patients were included (299 patients from South Africa and 200 from Belgium). They completed a questionnaire to express their preference for finger stick or venipuncture, after undergoing both. The South African patient cohort was divided in two groups, receiving either single or multiple finger stick for CD 4 and other HIV-related tests. The Belgian patients received a single finger stick for CD 4 testing, and were asked to respond directly and again after two days. RESULTS The majority of the patients preferred the finger stick to the venipuncture. The perceived pain using the blade was superior to a small needle, but similar to a large needle. They preferred up to three finger sticks over one venipuncture. Up to 30 % of the patients changed their mind over two days. The main reason for choosing a finger stick was continued bleeding after venipuncture. The most cited objection to finger stick was pain/soreness. CONCLUSION Patient perceptions support the implementation of donating capillary blood with bladebased finger stick during CD 4 point-of-care testing. S 1 File.

40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} finger {{pressure}} applied by dentists during cementation {{and to examine}} the effect of gender and time of <b>day</b> on <b>finger</b> pressure. Methods: Fifteen dentists (9 males, 6 females) formed a study group and 10 master dies in premolar shape and Turcom Cera all-ceramic crowns were prepared to measure the maximum finger pressure applied by dentists during cementation. The dentists performed a total of 300 cementation processes. One-way analysis of variance and independent t tests were used to evaluate the results. Results: A statistically significant difference was found in the amount of pressure applied during cementation (P<. 005). However, {{there was no significant difference}} for time of day or gender according to one-way analysis of variance. Conclusions: Our results show that finger pressure varies by dentist. For this reason, the optimum pressure should be determined exactly. Special equipment or an apparatus could be developed to apply that pressure. (Eur J Dent 2010; 4 : 383 - 388...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This study compares {{malt quality}} {{parameters}} of finger millet and sorghum. The quality of malt consequently affects {{the quality of}} opaque beer produced. Certain parameters are analyzed before the malt is accepted for beer brewing. Grain samples of finger millet and sorghum were tested for germination energy before malting. The resultant malts were analyzed for moisture, diastatic power and free amino nitrogen. Finger millet achieved 100 % germination while sorghum attained 99 % germination in 3 days. After 5 <b>days</b> malting <b>finger</b> millet had higher moisture content (44 %) than sorghum (48 %). In terms of free amino nitrogen, finger millet {{had an average of}} 114. 3 mg/L whilst sorghum had an average of 138. 6 mg/L.

40|$|For diabetics, {{continuous}} glucose monitoring, and {{the resulting}} tighter control of glucose levels, ameliorates serious complications from hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Today, diabetics measure their blood glucose levels multiple times a <b>day</b> by <b>finger</b> pricks, or use implantable monitoring devices. Still, glucose and other analytes in the blood fluctuate throughout {{the day and the}} current monitoring methods are invasive, immunogenic, and/or present biodegradation problems. Using carrier erythrocytes loaded with a fluorescent sensor, we seek to develop a biodegradable, efficient, and potentially cost effective method for long-term monitoring of blood analytes. We aim to reintroduce sensor-loaded erythrocytes to the bloodstream and conserve the erythrocytes lifetime of 120 days in the circulatory system. Here, the efficiency of two loading procedures is compared. Hypotonic dilution employs hypotonic buffer to create transient pores in the erythrocyte membrane, allowing dye entrance and a hypertonic buffer to restore tonicity. Electroporation relies on controlled electrical pulses that results in reversible pores formation to allow cargo entrance. As part of the cellular characterization of loaded erythrocytes, size and hemoglobin content was evaluated. Cell recovery and fluorescence per cell measurements also render optimal loading conditions. Furthermore, AFM and confocal microscopy protocols were implemented to evaluate morphological changes induced by hypotonic dilution. The development of a suitable protocol to engineer carrier erythrocytes has profound and lasting implications in the erythrocytes? lifespan and sensing capabilities...|$|R
