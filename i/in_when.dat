5|$|A {{small number}} of Ju 87s were also {{retained}} for anti-shipping operations in the Black Sea, a role it had proved so successful <b>in</b> <b>when</b> operating in the Mediterranean. In October 1943, this became evident again when StG 3 carried out several attacks against the Soviet Black Sea Fleet. On 6 October 1943 the most powerful flotilla in the fleet comprising the Leningrad class destroyers Kharkov, Besposhchadny and Sposobny were caught and sunk by dive -bombing. After the disaster, Josef Stalin decreed that no more ships were to pass within range of German aircraft without his personal permission.|$|E

5|$|Data {{is written}} to the flash memory in units called pages (made up of {{multiple}} cells). However, the memory can be erased only in larger units called blocks (made up of multiple pages). If the data {{in some of the}} pages of the block are no longer needed (also called stale pages), only the pages with good data in that block are read and rewritten into another previously erased empty block. Then the free pages left by not moving the stale data are available for new data. This is a process called garbage collection (GC). All SSDs include some level of garbage collection, but they may differ <b>in</b> <b>when</b> and how fast they perform the process.

5|$|Ferraro's first {{full-time}} political job came <b>in</b> , <b>when</b> she {{was appointed}} Assistant District Attorney for Queens County, New York, by her cousin, District Attorney Nicholas Ferraro. At the time, women {{prosecutors in the}} city were uncommon. Grumblings {{that she was the}} beneficiary of nepotism were countered by her being rated as qualified by a screening committee and by her early job performance in the Investigations Bureau. The following year, Ferraro was assigned to the new Special Victims Bureau, which prosecuted cases involving rape, child abuse, spouse abuse, and domestic violence. She was named head of the unit in 1977, with two other assistant district attorneys assigned to her. In this role, she became a strong advocate for abused children. She was admitted to the U.S. Supreme Court Bar in 1978.|$|E
5|$|For the Chemical Troops (Nebeltruppen) each {{decontamination}} battery (Entgiftungs-Batterie) {{was authorized}} six Sd.Kfz. 10/1 and six Sd.Kfz. 10/2.

If necessary they could be substituted for Sd.Kfz. 11s of the appropriate type. When the decontamination units were authorized to be re-equipped with heavy rocket launchers in November 1941 seven Sd.Kfz. 10/1s were used to tow the 28/32 cm Nebelwerfer 41 launchers and another {{was used by the}} platoon leader to tow an anti-tank gun.

Crosetti comforts Thormann's wife Eva (Edie Falco), but is privately told by Dr. Eli Devilbiss (Sean Whitesell) that Thormann may be blind or mentally disabled, even if he survives. Crosetti begs Gee to give him the case and, even though Gee believes he is too emotionally involved, he gives <b>in</b> <b>when</b> Crosetti tries to make him feel guilty by showing him his previous gunshot wounds.

5|$|Having survived {{until the}} end of the time stop, the LEP is bound by law and leaves the {{remaining}} gold and departs. At the end, Butler demands an explanation as to how Artemis came up with the idea of using sleeping pills. Artemis explains that he had gotten the idea from old fairy tales, in which human characters never wake up at an inopportune moment for the fairies, and had guessed that time-stops were the reason. Concluding that the time-stop forces a being to stay in whichever state of consciousness they were <b>in</b> <b>when</b> the time-stop is started, Artemis uses sleeping pills to break out of the time-stop.

In 1948–49, Harvey remained outside the first-choice team, and played in only two first-class matches against Tasmania when Victoria fielded a second-string team. He retired {{at the end of}} the season, having played only 22 first-class matches in an interrupted career.

McQueen objected to the depressing ending and Thompson was replaced by screenwriter Walter Hill. Hill had been recommended by Polly Platt, Bogdanovich's wife, who was then still attached to direct; Platt had been impressed by Hill's work on Hickey & Boggs (1972). Hill said Bogdanovich wanted to turn the material into a more Hitchcock-type thriller, but he had only gotten twenty-five pages <b>in</b> <b>when</b> McQueen fired the director.

5|$|Narrowing of the airways occurs due to {{inflammation}} and scarring within them. This {{contributes to the}} inability to breathe out fully. The greatest reduction in air flow occurs when breathing out, as the pressure in the chest is compressing the airways at this time. This can result in more air from the previous breath remaining within the lungs when the next breath is started, resulting {{in an increase in}} the total volume of air in the lungs at any given time, a process called hyperinflation or air trapping. Hyperinflation from exercise is linked to shortness of breath in COPD, as it is less comfortable to breathe <b>in</b> <b>when</b> the lungs are already partly full.
