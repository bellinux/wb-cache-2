25|$|Kalman filtering, {{also known}} as linear {{quadratic}} estimation (LQE), is an algorithm that uses a series of measurements observed over time, containing statistical noise and other inaccuracies, and produces estimates of unknown variables that {{tend to be more}} accurate than those based on a single measurement alone, by using Bayesian inference and estimating a <b>joint</b> <b>probability</b> distribution over the variables for each timeframe. The filter is named after Rudolf E. Kálmán, one of the primary developers of its theory.|$|E

40|$|This paper extends our {{probabilistic}} {{framework for}} two-player quantum games to the mutliplayer case, while giving a unified perspective for both classical and quantum games. Considering <b>joint</b> <b>probabilities</b> {{in the standard}} Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm (EPR-Bohm) setting for three observers, we use this setting in order to play general three-player non-cooperative symmetric games. We analyze how the peculiar non-factorizable <b>joint</b> <b>probabilities</b> provided by the EPR-Bohm setting can change {{the outcome of a}} game, while requiring that the quantum game attains a classical interpretation for factorizable <b>joint</b> <b>probabilities.</b> In this framework, our analysis of the three-player generalized Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) shows that the players can indeed escape from the classical outcome of the game, because of non-factorizable <b>joint</b> <b>probabilities</b> that the EPR setting can provide. This surprising result for three-player PD contrasts strikingly with our earlier result for two-player PD, played in the same framework, in which even non-factorizable <b>joint</b> <b>probabilities</b> do not result in escaping from the classical consequence of the game.

25|$|The {{difference}} between two models is that hierarchical model can explicitly make causal inference to predict certain stimulus while non-hierarchical model can only predict <b>joint</b> <b>probability</b> of stimuli. However, hierarchical model {{is actually a}} special case of non-hierarchical model by setting joint prior as a weighted average of the prior to common and independent causes, each weighted by their prior probability. Based on the correspondence of these two models, we can also say that hierarchical is a mixture modal of non-hierarchical model.|$|E
25|$|A {{probability}} distribution whose sample space is {{the set of}} real numbers is called univariate, while a distribution whose sample space is a vector space is called multivariate. A univariate distribution gives the probabilities of a single random variable taking on various alternative values; a multivariate distribution (a <b>joint</b> <b>probability</b> distribution) gives the probabilities of a random vector—a list {{of two or more}} random variables—taking on various combinations of values. Important and commonly encountered univariate {{probability distribution}}s include the binomial distribution, the hypergeometric distribution, and the normal distribution. The multivariate normal distribution is a commonly encountered multivariate distribution.|$|E

Like all forms of regression analysis, linear regression focuses on the conditional probability distribution of y given X, rather than on the <b>joint</b> <b>probability</b> distribution of y and X, which is the domain of multivariate analysis.|$|E

In this paper we introduce two methods, minAB and prodAB, to estimate <b>joint</b> <b>probabilities.</b> Both methods are based on a light-weight structure, partition support. The core idea is to maintain the partition support of itemsets over logically disjoint partitions and then use it to estimate <b>joint</b> <b>probabilities</b> of itemsets of higher cardinalitiess. We present extensive mathematical analyses on both methods and compare their performances on synthetic datasets. We also demonstrate a case study of using the estimation methods in Apriori algorithm for fast association mining. Moreover, we explore the usefulness of the estimation methods in other mining/learning tasks [9]. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the estimation methods...|$|R

40|$|A {{statistical}} analysis of optimal universal cloning shows {{that it is possible}} to identify an ideal (but non-positive) copying process that faithfully maps all properties of the original Hilbert space onto two separate quantum systems. The <b>joint</b> <b>probabilities</b> for non-commuting measurements on separate clones then correspond to the real parts of the complex <b>joint</b> <b>probabilities</b> observed in weak measurements on a single system, where the measurements on the two clones replace the corresponding sequence of weak measurement and post-selection.

Using dense, multi-target votes, not only produces good keypoint predictions, but also enables us to compute image-dependent <b>joint</b> keypoint <b>probabilities</b> by looking at consensus voting. This differs from most previous methods where <b>joint</b> <b>probabilities</b> are learned from relative keypoint locations and are independent of the image.
