25|$|In 1994, the National Institutes of Health {{established}} policy (Public Law 103-43) for {{the inclusion}} of women, children, and members of minority groups and their subpopulations in biomedical and behavioral clinical studies. Overcoming challenges to cultural competence in research also means that <b>institutional</b> <b>review</b> <b>board</b> membership should include representatives of large communities and cultural groups as representatives.|$|E

25|$|As {{with other}} kinds of drugs, the FDA regulates the quality and safety of gene therapy {{products}} and supervises how these products are used clinically. Therapeutic alteration {{of the human genome}} falls under the same regulatory requirements as any other medical treatment. Research involving human subjects, such as clinical trials, must be reviewed and approved by the FDA and an <b>Institutional</b> <b>Review</b> <b>Board.</b>|$|E
25|$|In December 2013, the FDA issued two warning letters, {{one to the}} Burzynski <b>Institutional</b> <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> and one to Burzynski, the {{subjects}} of the investigations in February. The FDA found that Burzynski and the IRB had largely failed to address the concerns identified in the initial observation reports. The letter to Burzynski noted serious problems with patient medical files {{with respect to a}} pediatric patient who died while treated by Burzynski and whose death apparently initiated the investigation.|$|E
25|$|To {{protect the}} rights and {{well-being}} of research participants, {{and at the same}} time discover meaningful results and insights into human behavior, virtually all social psychology research must pass an ethical review process. At most colleges and universities, this is conducted by an ethics committee or <b>Institutional</b> <b>Review</b> <b>Board.</b> This group examines the proposed research to make sure that no harm is likely to be done to the participants, and that the study's benefits outweigh any possible risks or discomforts to people taking part in the study.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the problem}} may well extend beyond the FDA to the entire {{research}} oversight system, which depends heavily on a network of <b>Institutional</b> <b>Review</b> <b>Boards</b> to protect subjects. Critics argue that <b>Institutional</b> <b>Review</b> <b>Boards</b> are understaffed and under-qualified, that they are excessively bureaucratic, and that they attempt to restrict research outside their mandate and expertise. Many <b>Institutional</b> <b>Review</b> <b>Boards,</b> {{such as the one}} at the University of Minnesota, are staffed by colleagues of clinical investigators whose studies are being evaluated, raising concerns about personal conflicts of interest. Others, known as “independent” or “commercial” <b>Institutional</b> <b>Review</b> <b>Boards,</b> are funded by research sponsors themselves, an arrangement that arguably presents a financial conflict of interest. Two separate sting operations have found commercial IRBs willing to approve phony research studies deliberately designed to be risky or fraudulent.|$|R

25|$|The most {{important}} contemporary standards are informed and voluntary consent. After World War II, the Nuremberg Code was established because of Nazi abuses of experimental subjects. Later, most countries (and scientific journals) adopted the Declaration of Helsinki. In the U.S., the National Institutes of Health established the <b>Institutional</b> <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> in 1966, and in 1974 adopted the National Research Act (HR 7724). All {{of these measures}} encouraged researchers to obtain informed consent from human participants in experimental studies. A number of influential studies led {{to the establishment of}} this rule; such studies included the MIT and Fernald School radioisotope studies, the Thalidomide tragedy, the Willowbrook hepatitis study, and Stanley Milgram's studies of obedience to authority.|$|E
25|$|After the {{publication}} of the paper, other researchers were unable to reproduce Wakefield's findings or confirm his hypothesis of an association between the MMR vaccine and autism, or autism and gastrointestinal disease. A 2004 investigation by Sunday Times reporter Brian Deer identified undisclosed financial conflicts of interest on Wakefield's part, and most of his co-authors then withdrew their support for the study's interpretations. The British General Medical Council (GMC) conducted an inquiry into allegations of misconduct against Wakefield and two former colleagues. The investigation centred on Deer's numerous findings, including that children with autism were subjected to unnecessary invasive medical procedures such as colonoscopies and lumbar punctures, and that Wakefield acted without the required ethical approval from an <b>institutional</b> <b>review</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E

2500|$|According to Dreger, whether federal {{regulations}} required professors to obtain formal approval from a university <b>Institutional</b> <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> (IRB) before interviewing people was uncertain at the time; {{she points out}} that shortly after publication of this book, the US Department of Health and Human Services, in conjunction with the Oral History Association and American Historical Association, issued a formal statement that taking oral histories, conducting interviews, collecting anecdotes, and similar activities do not constitute IRB-qualified research, and were never intended to be covered by clinical research rules, when such work is [...] "neither systematic nor generalizable in the scientific sense." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, the FDA {{issued a}} warning {{letter to the}} Burzynski Research Institute, stating that an {{investigation}} had determined the Burzynski <b>Institutional</b> <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> (IRB) [...] "did not adhere to the applicable statutory requirements and FDA regulations governing the protection of human subjects." [...] It {{identified a number of}} specific findings, among them that the IRB had approved research without ensuring risk to patients was minimized, had failed to prepare required written procedures or retain required documentation, and had failed to conduct required continuing reviews for studies, among others. [...] The Institute was given fifteen days to identify the steps it would take to prevent future violations.|$|E
2500|$|Another partial {{replication}} {{of the experiment}} was conducted by Jerry M. Burger in 2006 and broadcast on the Primetime series Basic Instincts. Burger noted that [...] "current standards {{for the ethical treatment}} of participants clearly place Milgram's studies out of bounds." [...] In 2009, Burger was able to receive approval from the <b>institutional</b> <b>review</b> <b>board</b> by modifying several of the experimental protocols. Burger found obedience rates virtually identical to those reported by Milgram found in 1961–62, even while meeting current ethical regulations of informing participants. In addition, half the replication participants were female, and their rate of obedience was virtually identical to that of the male participants. Burger also included a condition in which participants first saw another participant refuse to continue. However, participants in this condition obeyed at the same rate as participants in the base condition.|$|E

2500|$|CEAUSSIC's 74-page report {{argued that}} the [...] "goals" [...] and [...] "basic identity" [...] of HTS were {{characterized}} by [...] "confusion", and that the program was designed to simultaneously perform multiple tasks that were [...] "potentially irreconcilable"; e.g., serving as research function whilst also operating as [...] "a source of intelligence" [...] and a [...] "tactical function in counterinsurgency warfare". It added that this confusion would make it unclear to anthropologists whether they could follow the Code of Ethics or not. The commission further maintained that HTS personnel {{would be unable to}} [...] "maintain reliable control" [...] over the information they collected, and that there was a [...] "significant likelihood" [...] that HTS data would be used [...] "as part of military intelligence", which would place [...] "researchers and their counterparts in the field in harm's way". It also noted that if HTS were a research organization, [...] "it would be required to comply with federal law for subject protection" [...] and suggested that it was [...] "unusual" [...] that the program had avoided oversight by an <b>Institutional</b> <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> (IRB). In conclusion, the report stated: [...] "When ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions, not subject to external review, where data collection occurs in the context of war, integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency, and in a potentially coercive environment – all characteristic features of the HTS concept and its application – it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology". It recommended that the AAA emphasize the incompatibility of HTS with anthropological disciplinary ethics and practice.|$|E
