40|$|The {{performance}} {{and reliability of}} radio communication, navigation and remote sensing systems {{become more and more}} important in the modern society. To maintain and further develop <b>European</b> <b>expertise</b> and capabilities in enhancing accuracy and safety of these vulnerable modern technologies, integrated services must be established. Thus, a project is proposed that mobilizes the <b>European</b> scientific <b>expertise</b> in radio science, ionospheric and space weather research, innovative monitoring and imaging techniques, modern operational data processing and networking to establish novel models, tools and near-real-time services matching present and future needs. Ionospheric perturbations such as radio scintillations caused by diffraction of radio waves at small scale time-varying plasma density irregularities, Travelling Ionospheric Disturbances (TID’s), and steep ionization gradients generated in the course of severe ionospheric storms may cause serious performance degradation. To reduce the impact of these phenomena on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), ionospheric monitoring services already existing or planned to be established on national level, shall be integrated in a ‘European Ionospheric Perturbation Detection and Monitoring (IPDM) - Network’ to provide the required complex information in a timely and reliably manner. The European countries have the expertise and capabilities to realize this task at a high scientific and technological level by integrating interdisciplinary resources via enforced coordination of their work and closer cooperation. ...|$|R

40|$|Professional {{associations}} (PAs) are normative institutions whose {{tasks are}} to support members’ activities and use social obligation requirements to induce socially accepted behaviours within business networks (Grewal and Dharwadkar, 2002, p. 85).

This paper proposes a conceptual model of organisational members’ commitment to professional associations. Three dimensions of commitment – continuance, normative, and affective – are identified as mediators between organisational member’s characteristics (<b>expertise,</b> <b>service</b> consumption, formal participation, and social embeddedness) and relational outcomes (acquiescence, retention, coproduction, and advocacy). 7 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{survival}} rates in young cancer patients, new reproductive techniques {{and the growing}} interest in quality of life after gonadotoxic cancer therapies have placed fertility preservation as an important issue to oncologists, fertility specialists and patients. Several techniques are now available for fertility preservation in these patients. A new promising method is cryopreservation and transplantation of ovarian cortex. Ovarian tissue can be extracted by laparoscopy without any significant delay of gonadotoxic therapy. The tissue can be cryopreserved by specialised centres of reproductive medicine and transplanted in case the women experience premature ovarian failure (POF). This review summarises the <b>European</b> <b>expertise</b> on cryopreservation and transplantation of ovarian tissue, following around 30 reported transplantations globally, resulting in six live births and several ongoing pregnancies.
