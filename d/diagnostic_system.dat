Specifically the taxonomies system solo is studied, which {{that can be applied}} {{in a wide range of}} fields of diagnostic science. The intelligent system that is developed based on the presented modeling can make easier the use of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>systems</b> in education since the test correction is extremely hard and demands experts that are not always available. Additionally, the rate of the extraction of results is a reason for using and distributing such tools (<b>diagnostic</b> <b>systems)</b> in the educational process.

25|$|The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is {{the other}} {{commonly}} used manual for mental disorders and actually the official system for the US. It is distinguished from the DSM in that it covers health as a whole. While the DSM {{is the most popular}} <b>diagnostic</b> <b>system</b> for mental disorders in the US, the ICD is used more widely in Europe {{and other parts of the}} world. The DSM-IV-TR (4th. ed.) contains specific codes that allows for comparisons between the DSM and the ICD manuals, which may not systematically match because revisions are not simultaneously coordinated.|$|E
25|$|The ICD is {{published}} by the WHO and used worldwide for morbidity and mortality statistics, reimbursement systems, and automated decision support in health care. This system is designed to promote international comparability in the collection, processing, classification, and presentation of these statistics. Like the analogous Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (which is limited to psychiatric disorders), the ICD is a major project to statistically classify all health disorders, and provide diagnostic assistance. The ICD is a core statistically based classificatory <b>diagnostic</b> <b>system</b> for health care related issues of the WHO Family of International Classifications (WHO-FIC).|$|E
25|$|The CASI {{began as}} two {{separate}} measures that {{were developed to}} assist clinicians in obtaining information about youths from their caregivers. Although a variety of checklists were already available, most were not clearly connected to the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>system</b> used by psychiatry and many other professions. The authors saw this need and began to create a symptom checklist in 1984 {{that was based on}} the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Their goal was to obtain information about children who were receiving special education services so that they could assign them into groups based on their learning and behavioral problems that were more relevant to conventional psychiatric diagnoses (need citation). In this way, the measures helped gather information that helped the clinician form a diagnostic impression. The items also rated the severity of the symptoms. Adding them created a severity score that help guide selection of treatment targets. The original motivation for developing the checklist was to aid with research and gathering of fairly large amounts of data in schools; however, the creators soon saw the possible application of these symptom inventories in clinical settings. To that end, they began work in 1986 on an instrument that would be used by teachers and parents to give a comprehensive look at a youth's emotional and behavioral symptoms. This led to the earliest measure related to the CASI- the Stony Brook Child Symptom Inventory-3 (CSI-3). In 1987 this was followed by the CSI-3R based on the revised third edition of the DSM (DSM-III-R). The CSI-3R included both teacher and parent checklists. The teacher checklist focused on youth behaviors more likely take place in a school setting. In 1990, Dr. Gabrielle Carlson adapted the parent checklist from the CSI-3R for use with adolescents, which became the first version of the Adolescent Symptom Inventory (ASI-3R). After the fourth edition of the DSM was published in 1994, the CSI-4 was developed in response to those changes. The CSI-4 was available in both Spanish and English. In 1995, the ASI was also updated to the ASI-4 to account for modifications in the DSM.|$|E

There is also an auxiliary three-phase power supply which powers the compressor, pumps, ventilators and other auxiliary equipment, operated by four separate inverters.

500|$|Duke's faculty {{is among}} the most {{productive}} in the nation. Throughout the school's history, Duke researchers have made breakthroughs, including the biomedical engineering department's development of the world's first real-time, three-dimensional ultrasound <b>diagnostic</b> <b>system</b> and the first engineered blood vessels and stents. In 2015, Paul Modrich shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 2012, Robert Lefkowitz along with Brian Kobilka, who is also a former affiliate, shared the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their work on cell surface receptors. [...] In the mechanical engineering department, Adrian Bejan developed the constructal theory, which explains the shapes that arise in nature. Duke has pioneered studies involving nonlinear dynamics, chaos, and complex systems in physics. In May 2006 Duke researchers mapped the final human chromosome, which made world news as the Human Genome Project was finally complete. Reports of Duke researchers' involvement in new AIDS vaccine research surfaced in June 2006. The biology department combines two historically strong programs in botany and zoology, while one of the divinity school's leading theologians is Stanley Hauerwas, whom Time named [...] "America's Best Theologian" [...] in 2001. The graduate program in literature boasts several internationally renowned figures, including Fredric Jameson, Michael Hardt, and Rey Chow, while philosophers Robert Brandon and Lakatos Award-winner Alexander Rosenberg contribute to Duke's ranking as the nation's best program in philosophy of biology, according to the Philosophical Gourmet Report.|$|E
