5|$|The History of Animals {{contains}} many accurate eye-witness observations, in particular {{of the marine}} biology around the island of Lesbos, such as that the octopus had colour-changing abilities and a sperm-transferring tentacle, that the young of a dogfish grow inside their mother's body, or that the male of a river catfish guards the eggs after the female has left. Some of these were long considered fanciful before being rediscovered in the nineteenth century. Aristotle {{has been accused of}} making errors, but some are due to misinterpretation of his text, and others may have been based on genuine observation. He did however make somewhat uncritical use of evidence <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>people,</b> such as travellers and beekeepers.|$|E

5|$|The UMWA {{tried to}} focus the strikers on civil disobedience and often stepped in to stop the wildcat strikers. The union members used many {{different}} nonviolent strike tactics. These acts included standing and blocking the roads that the coal trucks would travel, mass sit down strikes, and large groups of people picketing outside of the Pittston coal mines. This method of protesting helped the UMWA gain support <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> around the country.|$|E
5|$|Digital: A Love Story is {{a visual}} novel, or {{interactive}} fiction game, where the game's {{story is told}} primarily through text. The game is presented {{as if on a}} computer from the late 1980s running the Amie operating system (the name and visual appearance a reference to 1.x versions of AmigaOS). The player logs into bulletin board systems, or BBSs, where they read and reply to messages <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>people.</b> Messages received from other characters in the game are displayed through a different program on the computer screen. Accessing a BBS requires the knowledge of the telephone number for that board, which the player must type in manually. Boards that require a long-distance telephone number to reach require the player to use illegally obtained long-distance calling card numbers found online. Accessing boards also requires the player to either set up a user account for that board or to know the password necessary to enter the system.|$|E
5|$|Reports were sketchy {{initially}} â€“ television pictures {{broadcast on}} ITV showed Stein, {{who appeared to}} be both conscious and alert, being carried down the tunnel by a number of police officers, with commentator Brian Moore speculating that he had been overcome with the emotion of the result. BBC Radio commentator Peter Jones (who had no access to the television pictures and was relying on information <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> in the press box) also speculated that the tension of the result and the night had led to Stein's collapse. Willie Miller, the Scottish captain on the night in the absence of Graeme Souness, was informed by Martin Tyler of ITV Sport during the post-match interview that Stein had collapsed, with Alex Ferguson entering the dressing room to tell them that Stein had suffered a heart attack.|$|E

25|$|Additive manufacturing, {{starting}} with today's infancy period, requires manufacturing firms to be flexible, ever-improving users of all available technologies to remain competitive.

25|$|Girard's {{fundamental}} ideas, {{which he}} had developed throughout his career and provided the foundation for his thinking, were that desire is mimetic (i.e. all of our desires are borrowed <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>people),</b> that all conflict originates in mimetic desire (mimetic rivalry), that the scapegoat mechanism is the origin of sacrifice and the foundation of human culture, and religion was necessary in human evolution to control the violence that can come from mimetic rivalry, and that the Bible reveals these ideas and denounces the scapegoat mechanism.|$|E
