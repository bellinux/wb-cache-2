Otherwise, a papal bull to his son Canute <b>I</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>that</b> {{he was killed by}} unspecified enemies. The short chronicle in the Västgötalagen from c. 1240 says: [...] "The twelfth king was Eric. He was rashly killed in an unhappy moment. He always gave a good example while he lived, and God rewarded him well. Now his soul is at rest with God and his angels, and his bones rest in Uppsala. And he has, with God's help, made and manifested many precious miracles." [...] In a letter from 1172, Pope Alexander III complains that some people in Sweden had begun worshiping [...] "a man who had been killed in debauchery and feasting". Some scholars have assumed that King Eric is alluded to, and that the celebration of the Ascension Day was accompanied by feasting which enabled the surprise rebel attack. The identification is very uncertain, however.|$|E

40|$|Edwin Powel Hubble is {{regarded}} as one of the most important astronomers of 20 th century. In despite of his great contributions to the field of astronomy, he never received the Nobel Prize because astronomy was not considered as the field of the Nobel Prize in Physics at that era. There is an anecdote about the relation between Hubble and the Nobel Prize. According to this anecdote, the Nobel Committee decided to award the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1953 to Hubble as the first Nobel laureate as an astronomer (Christianson 1995). However, Hubble was died just before its announcement, and the Nobel prize is not awarded posthumously. Documents of the Nobel selection committee are open after 50 years, thus this anecdote can be verified. <b>I</b> <b>confirmed</b> <b>that</b> the Nobel selection committee endorsed Frederik Zernike as the Nobel laureate in Physics in 1953 on September 15 th, 1953, which is 13 days before the Hubble's death in September 28 th, 1953. <b>I</b> also <b>confirmed</b> <b>that</b> Hubble and Henry Norris Russell were nominated but they are not endorsed because the Committee concluded their astronomical works were not appropriate for the Nobel Prize in Physics.

30|$|Direct {{observation}} (additional experiment <b>I)</b> <b>confirmed</b> <b>that</b> these {{periods of}} inactivity {{that lasted for}} ca. 2  days were due to ecdysis. Figure  5 shows the process of ecdysis of a middle instar larva. Three instances of ecdysis were directly confirmed for three different larvae in middle or later instars. These larvae underwent ecdysis 1.1  days after they became inactive on average. They did not consume their skins. Two other instances of ecdysis of two first instar larvae were also captured, although both larvae died after ecdysis, probably because of the disturbance. Based on the direct observation, {{it was revealed that}} an active period corresponded to an instar period and the number of inactive periods represented the number of ecdysis events.|$|R

The anti-CL antibody reacted with L-form of bacteria and bacterial membrane fractions, but it did not react with the vegetative form of bacteria other than S. aureus nor with DNA. On the basis of these findings, I considered that the L-form of bacteria or fragments of bacterial membranes can be detected by immunofluorescence antibody technique or nitrocellulose membrane-enzyme immunoassay using the anti-CL antibody...|$|R
