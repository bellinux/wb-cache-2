40|$|Purpose: This {{paper is}} {{intended}} as {{a contribution to the}} performance evaluation of Third Sector organisations. The Italian experience on the development and adoption of <b>harmonised</b> <b>indicators</b> is considered here as an example of problems and possible solutions. Design/methodology/approach: Preliminary analysis shows that, in the Italian situation, two main gaps exist. The first one relates to the incomplete statistical information on the magnitude and performance of Third Sector organisations; the second is related to the lack of a set of <b>harmonised</b> <b>indicators.</b> To address these problems, two initiatives have been recently set up in Italy. On the one hand, the newly presented "National Strategy on Social Corporate Responsibility - 2012 - 2014 " has been oriented to fill the statistical gap, by extending the compilation of socio-economic and environmental accounts to Third Sector organisations; on the other hand, a joint initiative of the Italian Statistical Institute (Istat) and the CSR Manager Network Italia (CMN) towards the harmonization of the “Global Reporting Initiatives (GRI) -quantitative performance indicators” and the standards of the Italian statistical system. Within the second initiative, a specific sub-set of performance indicators for Third Sector organisations is proposed and presented in this paper. Findings: The Italian experiences reported here, together with the set of proposed indicators, can be used to improve data collection and to move towards a common framework for performance evaluation in the Third Sector organisations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Used in {{conjunction}} with biological surveillance, behavioural surveillance provides data allowing for a more precise definition of HIV/STI prevention strategies. In 2008, mapping of behavioural surveillance in EU/EFTA countries was performed {{on behalf of the}} European Centre for Disease prevention and Control. Method Nine questionnaires were sent to all 31 member States and EEE/EFTA countries requesting data on the overall behavioural and second generation surveillance system and on surveillance in the general population, youth, men having sex with men (MSM), injecting drug users (IDU), sex workers (SW), migrants, people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), and sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics patients. Requested data included information on system organisation (e. g. sustainability, funding, institutionalisation), topics covered in surveys and main indicators. Results Twenty-eight of the 31 countries contacted supplied data. Sixteen countries reported an established behavioural surveillance system, and 13 a second generation surveillance system (combination of biological surveillance of HIV/AIDS and STI with behavioural surveillance). There were wide differences as regards the year of survey initiation, number of populations surveyed, data collection methods used, organisation of surveillance and coordination with biological surveillance. The populations most regularly surveyed are the general population, youth, MSM and IDU. SW, patients of STI clinics and PLWHA are surveyed less regularly and in {{only a small number of}} countries, and few countries have undertaken behavioural surveys among migrant or ethnic minorities populations. In many cases, the identification of populations with risk behaviour and the selection of populations to be included in a BS system have not been formally conducted, or are incomplete. Topics most frequently covered are similar across countries, although many different indicators are used. In most countries, sustainability of surveillance systems is not assured. Conclusion Although many European countries have established behavioural surveillance systems, there is little harmonisation as regards the methods and indicators adopted. The main challenge now faced is to build and maintain organised and functional behavioural and second generation surveillance systems across Europe, to increase collaboration, to promote robust, sustainable and cost-effective data collection methods, and to <b>harmonise</b> <b>indicators.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{understand}} why European countries show a very different picture of female employment (in their fertile ages) {{which is not the}} case for men of the same age. We shed light on the various positions of countries in this framework of earner-carer models, in analysing policy designs, policy outcomes and policy determinants. That is, respectively, family policy indicators, employment of mothers and childless women, gender role attitudes and their interacting effect with policies and employment outcomes. We have used a wide range of primary or secondary quantitative and qualitative data to carry out our comparative analysis, mixing approaches, techniques and methods, from micro-econometric models to macro-level <b>harmonised</b> <b>indicators,</b> supplemented with a case study.

The present paper presents a model performed through SUNET (System for Urban Noise and Eco-Traffic) system, including data collection equipment (Sound Metter Level UC 2010 - 2, Weather Station (Tehno Line WS 550), software to process them (SoundPLAN) and <b>harmonised</b> <b>indicators</b> (Lden and Lnight – A-weighted long-term average sound level as defined in ISO 1996 - 2 : 1987) in order to validate the results. The study refers to a major road section in agglomeration Cluj-Napoca and considers all aspects regarding the urban area (type of road, architecture, buildings etc.) and traffic (speed, traffic composition, traffic density flow etc.). Measurements made in major roads in Cluj-Napoca reveal overcoming of limit values for almost all intervals of day. Even if for the road network from Cluj-Napoca, many actions were taken, like lower speed limits, heavy traffic prohibited, improved surface course, the maximum values allowed for 2012 are exceeded and more actions are needed in order to achieve these targets. Monitoring noise levels on the urban road network through the equipment and methods according to the law leads to actual results and an appropriate implementation of action plans...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the marginal effects of traditional determinants of {{exports and imports}} {{with a focus on}} the role of price competitiveness in restoring external balances. It is a first attempt to compare marginal effects of various <b>harmonised</b> competitiveness <b>indicators</b> (HCIs) on both exports and imports of both goods and services across individual euro area countries. We find evidence that HCIs based on broader cost and price measures have a larger marginal effect (with some exceptions) on exports of goods. Exports of services are sensitive to HCIs in big euro area countries and Slovakia, where exports of services are also found more sensitive to competitiveness indicators based on broader price measures. Imports of goods and imports of services are quite insensitive to changes in relative prices. Finally, in some cases measures of fit indicate that a large unexplained residual part is present, implying that other non-price related factors might {{play an important role in}} driving foreign trade...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} digital skills, and its {{aim is to}} empirically assess the Matthew effect in Italy. Thus, {{following}} an empirical point of view, microdata from Italian official statistical sources (Istat, Istituto Nazionale di Statistica) and <b>harmonised</b> European <b>indicators</b> have been used. The chapter is structured as follows: Section 2 overviews the various measurement approaches suggested in the literature. Section 3 presents the European framework that is the operating procedures – and the recent changes – proposed by the European Commission to detect and measure eSkills. Using Istat microdata, Sections 4 and 5 focus on the Italian context, to identify the synthetic indices of e-skills and an Internet user’s typology based on digital competence and socio-demographic characteristics. Finally, in Section 6 the main results are summarized and new lines of research are proposed. This chapter highlights the relation between e-inclusion and e-skills, starting with the complexity of these concepts, which are often applied with different semantic dimensions and different modalities of measurement. The different approaches to establishing indicators of e-skills inevitably introduce elements of diversification. To obviate this problem, setting up shared indicators, used in periodical extensive surveys, {{makes it possible to}} compare the results in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Thus, it seems appropriate to use <b>indicators</b> <b>harmonised</b> in the European Union. The results of this study, which was based on using data collected by the Italian official statistical sources (Istat), reveals the convergence of skills pertaining to computer use with those linked to the Internet use. A diversification of skills in terms of complexity and the different types of ability is clear, depending on a prevalently instrumental or prevalently relational use of the technology. Digital inequalities are thus reiterated, also within a segment of the population that represents the youngest, better qualified subgroup, better positioned in terms of the labour market and which can consider itself “included”, {{on the basis of the}} simple criterion of net access. Even within the connected group, the dynamics of the Matthew effect can be seen: those with the "richest" personal resources activate a cumulative multiplication of advantages that follows the logic of “those who have, will be given more”. Instead the “poorest” are victims of a cumulative multiplication of disadvantages according to the logic of “those who have nothing, will have even that taken away”. Thus, there are categories of subjects who are “richer” and “poorer” in e-skills, who again present the customary inequalities of gender (men/women), generations (young/old), and culture (low/high education). These elements reiterate the old, but not negligible, inequalities, heightened by the new technologies: "the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer"...|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} <b>harmonised</b> {{epidemiological}} <b>indicators</b> are proposed for food-borne biological hazards {{to public health}} {{that are related to}} bovine animals and meat thereof and that can be addressed within meat inspection. These hazards include Salmonella, pathogenicverocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli, Cysticercus (Taenia saginata) and mycobacteria. An epidemiological indicator is defined as the prevalence or the concentration of the hazard at a certain stage of the food chain or an indirect measure of the hazard that correlates with the human health risk caused by the hazard. The indicators can be used by the European Commission and the Member States to consider when adaptations to meat inspection methods may be required, and to carry out risk analysis to support such decisions. It is foreseen that the indicators will be used in the bovine carcase meat safety assurance system outlined in the EFSA Scientific Opinion, particularly to help categorise farms/herds and slaughterhouses according to the risk related to the hazards as well as setting appropriate specific hazard-based targets in/on bovine carcases and, when appropriate, in bovine farms/herds. Depending on the purpose and the epidemiological situation risk managers should decide on the most appropriate indicator(s) to use, either alone or in combination, at national, regional, slaughterhouse or farm/herd level. It is recommended that risk managers should define the harmonised requirements for controlled husbandry conditions of farms, and the requirements for food chain information. Member States are invited to organise training regarding the implementation of the indicators and the reporting of data generated by the implementation in accordance with Directive 2003 / 99 /EC. The proposed indicators should be regularly reviewed in the light of new information and the data generated by their implementation...|$|R

40|$|In October 2009, the Council of the European Union {{adopted the}} Directive on Sustainable Use of Pesticides (EU 128 / 2009 /EC). This {{directive}} establishes a framework {{to achieve the}} sustainable use of pesticides by reducing the risk and impacts of pesticide use on both {{human health and the}} environment, and promoting the use of integrated pest management and of alternative approaches or techniques. These risks thus need to be assessed using appropriate risk indicators. The OPERA Research Centre organised an expert working group and has had several consultations with stakeholders in order to identify a common way of thinking in evaluating and identifying the factors that should be considered in selecting each <b>indicator.</b> <b>Harmonised</b> criteria have been suggested to allow the selection of the most appropriate indicators, focusing on the use phase of pesticide, as requested by the sustainable use directive.

40|$|A single {{solution}} to promote higher animal welfare {{across the whole}} EU is unlikely due to significant regional differences and because what is most appropriate for each region depends on many factors. Based on analyses of eight member and candidate EU countries, this paper provides a conceptual framework, an 'animal welfare roadmap', {{which can be used}} to assess the stage of maturity of a country in farm animal welfare policy development and identify appropriate policy instruments and indicators to monitor progress towards higher animal welfare. The 'roadmap' consists of five sequential stages: increasing compliance with legislation; raising awareness; product development; mainstreaming; and integration of animal welfare with other issues. For each stage, specific policy instruments are identified alongside the category of stakeholders most likely to be influential in the implementation of each instrument. The policy instruments used to achieve these stages are those used by government departments/agencies, private enterprises, academic bodies or non-governmental organisations who formulate standards for animal welfare. These are supported by indicators best suited to document their effectiveness. Although we have emphasised how different situations and contexts within the EU mean that there is no single optimal policy instrument for the EU as a whole, but rather appropriate policy instruments should be selected according to the stage of development of a country or sector, we do propose a <b>harmonised</b> choice of <b>indicators</b> to allow benchmarking of changes at the EU level with regard to progress towards animal welfare...|$|R
40|$|SMART {{indicators}} {{were developed}} using the AFI structure and method for relatively extensive dry-stock, and relatively intensive dairy farming {{in the northwest}} and south of Ireland, respectively. Both these farming contexts {{are subject to the}} same multi-objective Irish Rural Environment Protection Scheme. The rationale and detailed structure of four indicators are presented; these relate to: organic nutrient application, organic nutrient storage, the biodiversity value of intensive grass husbandry, and the aesthetic landscape value of grass husbandry practice. Sixteen other indicators are detailed in supplementary material. The majority of the indicators developed are proxy indicators based on farm management practice, and provide an indirect measure or estimate of likely environmental quality, or relative environmental risk. In many cases, the complexities of environmental concerns required the development of integrative multi-metric indicators with corresponding transformation functions. Wherever possible, these functions were based on known (evidence-based) regional or national impact models. Such models (including quantification of relevant environmental quality levels) were frequently unavailable, in which case a participatory process of stakeholder and expert engagement was essential to fill knowledge gaps. Despite their customisation to the farming contexts studied, the basic structure and underlying logic of many of the developed indicators may be of much wider use in similar livestock-based agro-ecosystems. A common, georeferenced spatial framework built on contextual indicators that takes into account climate and farming type, would represent a significant advance in the <b>harmonised</b> development of <b>indicators</b> relevant to analysis of agri-environmental policy.

40|$|Innovation is {{fundamental}} for economic catching-up and raising living standards. Evidence demonstrate a virtuous circle in which R&D spending, innovation, productivity, and {{per capita income}} mutually reinforce each other and lead to long-term, sustained growth rates and may foster job creation. Previous evidence highlights that Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) has great potential to benefit from investment and policies that foster innovation. However, one important limitation of previous research on innovation in LAC {{is the absence of}} <b>harmonised</b> and comparable <b>indicators</b> across the different countries. This seriously limits the possibility to infer policy conclusions that are not affected by country specificities with respect to data quality and coverage. Also, most of this research is focused on estimating firm level correlations without attempting to identify market failures or other limitations which harm innovation investment or which could guide policy. In this paper, a wide range of innovation indicators are analysed in order to describe the innovation behaviour of manufacturing firms in LAC using the Enterprise Survey (ES) database. Our objective is to understand the main characteristics of innovative firms in LAC and to gather new evidence with regard {{to the nature of the}} innovation process in the region. In this paper we apply a structural model based on Crepon, Duget and Mairesse (1998), to estimate the determinants of innovation (R&D) and its impact on total factor productivity. We pay special attention to whether there is heterogeneity in the effects of investments in innovation on productivity and whether there is any evidence of spillovers that could guide policy design. We found strong evidence concerning the relationships between innovation input and output, and innovation output and productivity. We found that private returns to innovation depend on the type of innovation, being larger for product than process innovation. Furthermore, we found some evidence that spillovers are stronger in the case of product than process innovation. It was also found that innovation returns are higher for the most productive firms. This increasing relationship between returns and productivity is not consistent with an interpretation that financial constraints cause more harm to low productivity firms. However, it is consistent with alternative interpretations about the lack of innovation opportunities in the case of low productivity firms or that low private returns are the results of poor appropriability...|$|R
