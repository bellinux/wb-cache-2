5|$|Manga-News {{reviewed}} the story arc positively. They praised {{several aspects of}} the story arc: the plot and narration for being captivating and for including famous London settings, references to Sherlock Holmes, and the Wimbledon competition; the characterization for the antagonist Sabara Hades; and the romance between Shinichi and Ran which was described as an event readers <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for.</b> Manga-News however criticized how Shinichi and Ran's interaction were covered by flashbacks instead of happening chronologically. AnimeLand reviewed volume 71 and called it the best since volume 59.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1996, Deal {{changed the}} name of the group back to the Breeders, {{originally}} with almost the same line-up as the Amps. Until then, Deal <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> Wiggs and Kelley to rejoin the Breeders and record a new album together, and had held back from reforming the Breeders out of respect for them. In May 1996, Wiggs revealed that she would not be involved in any immediate Breeders activity; Kelley also chose to stay in Saint Paul, to be close to her rehabilitation facility. Deal then decided that {{she did not want to}} wait any longer to reform the group, partly because the Breeders' repertoire was larger than the Amps', thereby allowing longer concerts. Deal added violinist Carrie Bradley (who had played on the Breeders' Pod album), and with Macpherson, Lerma, and Farley, played some shows in 1996 with Primus.|$|E

Unable to sustain their relationship, the two break up; two years later, Haruto is transferred back to Tokyo and reunites with Yuzuki, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> his return.

25|$|The {{game was}} washed out. Heavy rain poured {{in the day}} before, and the ground could not be dried {{sufficient}} enough for the game to start. Finally the game was called off by the Umpires' decisions without a ball being bowled due to a soggy outfield, an outcome that angered the fans who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the game to start for five hours and they eventually started showing their frustration by hurling stones and setting fire to objects in the stands.|$|E

25|$|Karlo Štajner, a Croatian {{communist}} who {{was active}} in the former Kingdom of Yugoslavia and the manager of the Comintern Publishing House in Moscow 1932–39, was arrested one night and taken from his Moscow home after being accused of anti-revolutionary activities. He spent the next 20 years in camps from Solovki to Norilsk. After USSR–Yugoslavian political normalization he was re-tried and quickly found innocent. He left the Soviet Union with his wife, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> him for 20 years, in 1956 and spent {{the rest of his life}} in Zagreb, Croatia. He wrote an impressive book titled 7000 days in Siberia.|$|E
25|$|In July 2011, the House Ethics Committee {{announced}} that it was investigating accusations that Schmidt had accepted roughly $500,000 in free legal services from a Turkish-American interest group (the Turkish Coalition of America). Schmidt said that she hadn't received a bill for the legal services in question, and that she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> more than a year for guidance from the ethics committee on the proper procedure to pay the bill. In August 2011, the Ethics Committee rendered its decision, holding that the interest group's payment for legal services in connection with her proceedings against Krikorian had been improper, and ordering Schmidt to repay the group $500,000.|$|E

25|$|Many Catholics and nationalists {{believed}} that the IRA {{had been unable to}} defend them during the August 1969 riots. However, it is argued that the IRA's defence of Short Strand redeemed it {{in the eyes of many}} Catholics and nationalists. Prior to the gun battle, the IRA <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> an opportunity to portray themselves as defenders of the Catholic community, which was only made possible by the over-stretching of British Army forces dealing with rioting throughout Belfast and thus unable to provide protection to the Short Strand. Among republicans, the battle is seen as a key event in the growth of the Provisional IRA.|$|E
25|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the vote, the DUP had printed and {{distributed}} over 40,000 leaflets in East Belfast, with help from the UUP. The leaflets attacked Alliance and called on people to protest against its proposal. Alliance accused the unionists of trying to raise tensions. In the May 2010 general election, Naomi Long of Alliance had defeated Peter Robinson of the DUP to win the East Belfast seat. This was the first time that a non-unionist party had won the seat. It is thought that many unionists voted for Alliance as a protest at Robinson's financial misdealings. Some commentators believed that the DUP <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> a chance to weaken the Alliance Party and win back their former voters in East Belfast.|$|E
25|$|In May 2002, the Guardian Media Group made a bid of £41 {{million to}} Jazz FM plc at 180p a share. The bid {{came on the}} day when the draft Communication Bill was {{published}} Jazz FM plc's largest shareholder, Clear Channel <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> a 220p a share bid, but agreed to the 180p a share bid in late May. Herald Investment Management who had a 7.7% stake in the company and Aberforth Partners were not happy with the 180p a share bid. On 6 June, GMG raised its bid to 195p a share to secure the institutional shareholders who were holding out for a better bid. Richard Wheatly announced that he would leave Jazz FM once the takeover was complete. The offer was declared wholly unconditional on 5 July. In December 2002, GMG moved its sales operation from Clear Channel Radio Sales to the Chrysalis Group, inline with the sales operation for other GMG Radio stations.|$|E
