40|$|Taxing {{wealth is}} an {{important}} part of tax policy debates today. The prospect though <b>for</b> <b>taxing</b> wealth seems to be bleak. But does the financial crisis create opportunities <b>for</b> <b>taxing</b> wealth? The financial crisis might change debates by acting as a shock to the tax policy process and boost political arguments <b>for</b> <b>taxing</b> wealth. This article explores whether the financial crisis has such an impact by looking at tax policy debates in the United Kingdom. The article looks at examples of three main ways of taxing wealth, namely, proposals <b>for</b> an inheritance <b>tax,</b> mansion tax and capital gains tax. This article argues that the financial crisis has an impact on political debates but that its impact is uneven. The financial crisis provides a greater boost <b>for</b> a mansion <b>tax</b> idea over inheritance tax or capital gains tax. However, political arguments <b>for</b> <b>taxing</b> wealth are refracted by other factors such as lobbying by vested interests...|$|R

5|$|Crucial to the {{attractiveness}} to investors of all MIS schemes is their taxation treatment.

Great Southern managed the woodlot, and the investor could deduct the cost of the lease from the income they declared that year <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> assessment purposes.
