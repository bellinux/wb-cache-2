These days it can seem ubiquitous: from the rhetorical mobilizations of one war after the other, to the ideological pressures of austerity, to the "necessary" disruptions of life in neoliberal democracies, to the urgent adjustments demanded (and ignored) for a changing climate. Everywhere you turn, it seems, some form of sacrifice is rearing its head, demanding tribute. The history of the concept runs deep, open to many readings.

She went clear of the field and won by six lengths from My Happy Face, with Unlimited Budget finishing last of the five runners. Pletcher felt that the filly had not been given credit for her previous win saying: [...] "I think everyone kind of lost sight of the fact that going into the Kentucky Oaks, it was billed as the best Oaks we've seen in 25 years; this filly wins it and gets virtually no respect. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>today</b> she put herself at the top of the leader board, and now everyone understands that the Kentucky Oaks was a real race." ...|$|E

5000|$|Detroit's tight 90-degree {{turns and}} short {{straight}} sections {{had given the}} underpowered [...] "atmo" [...] cars a chance at {{several times during the}} turbo era, and some teams were hoping the quirky circuit might give them a bit of a chance. Senna took the twenty-second pole of his career by more than eight-tenths, but the Ferraris of Gerhard Berger and Michele Alboreto both lined up ahead of Prost, who was fourth and openly admitted that he simply did not like the circuit. The teams were all hoping for cooler temperatures for the race on Sunday, after the track had begun to break up during qualifying (expedited by a Trans-Am race on Saturday). Predictably there was a push from the F1 teams to have the Trans-Am race cancelled, but with that series having guaranteed television coverage of each round (of which Detroit was a part), the race went ahead and as feared, the powerful, heavy saloons tore the track up surface even more. Hasty concrete repairs made the surface extremely abrasive for the soft compound tires most teams had brought, and teams were forced to reconsider their plans for a non-stop race. On Sunday morning, Berger said, [...] "Really, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>today</b> is a lottery...."

5000|$|Osteen {{says that}} he chooses {{to focus more on}} the {{goodness}} of God and on living an obedient life rather than on sin. He {{says that he}} tries to teach Biblical principles in a simple way, emphasizing the power of love and a positive attitude. When asked why he does not focus more on sin, the devil and hell in detail, Osteen stated in an interview with CBN News: When I grew up, the devil was a reason why I had a headache or the devil was the reason I got mad today. We always blamed the devil. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>today</b> when I say the enemy, I like to make it broader. Sometimes the enemy can be our own thoughts. We've trained ourselves the wrong way. Or the enemy can be our own lack of discipline. Some people preach about hell like you're already going there, and to me the Gospel means 'Good News.' I'd rather say God is a God of mercy. So I think the people already know what they're doing wrong, and I certainly believe in hell. But to me, when I see thousands of people before me, it just doesn't come out of me to say, 'You guys are terrible, and you're going to hell.' I'd rather say that God is a God of mercy. You've got to live an obedient life, but for every mistake you’ve made, there's mercy there, and I believe we can do better.|$|E
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} my brief remarks this {{afternoon}} {{is to use}} {{the life and times of}} Shirley Graham Du Bois as a vehicle for trying to understand how and why we need to think about revitalizing the radical tradition through the means of revisioning and rewriting our history, our past. I argue in these remarks that like other historians - for Shirley Graham Du Bois was among other things an historian - she tended to stress in her history writing, like most of the writers of her generation, the [...] "Crispus Attucks" [...] aspect of our history, I'm sure you're familiar with Crispus Attucks, he goes down in history as the first person to be slain in the uprising against British rule in then-British North America and a symbol of how black people have shed their blood to help to construct this country. Which of course is true and is accurate. But it only begins to tell part of the story, as I'll try to elaborate on in my remarks. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>today</b> it's particularly important to talk about revitalizing our past so that we can reinvigorate the radical tradition in light of this precipitous downturn that we see in the capitalist economy. Newsweek has been amongst the many journals that have told us [...] "We're All Socialists Now", which some might be surprised to hear. In Latin America, certainly in the most recent election in El Salvador, and in Latin American generally, one can easily espy a shift to the left. The quipsters are suggesting that the recently departed Pres. George W. Bush entered office in 2001 as a social conservative but then after being compelled to nationalize various enterprises he leaves office as a conservative socialist. When you note that in South Africa you have a Communist Party minister sitting in office in Pretoria, and perhaps the same will take place in New Delhi, after the elections that take place in the late spring, it's time to revive that aspect it seems to me reality is shouting at us, time to revitalize that aspect of black history that stresses our ancestors who as early as the 18th century were actually trying to overthrow the government of the United States of America, as opposed to shedding their blood to help to create the government of the United States of America.|$|E

40|$|Why, {{what and}} how do we treat the {{linguistic}} aspects of idiographic science? What is the theoretical and methodological status of language within idiographic science? Our contribute move from the perspective of clinical psychology, a perspective that try to connect theoretical principles with an intervention praxis.

As clinical psychologist we are interested to the single case as part of a general category of cases, cases with characteristics that can be gradually identified and classified, at the same time <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>today</b> ideographic science let us accept the challenge of finding methodological criterion to understand how psychological phenomenon which interest the psychologist are strictly interdependent with the contextual dynamics that generated the intervention request. This logic is based on the principle that the relationship between the dynamics of the psychological process and the occurrences of this dynamics as phenomenon is always and however mediated by a contextual condition...|$|R
