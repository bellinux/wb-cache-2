The objective of this {{research is}} to determine the relationship between factors and people involvement in drug mule. There are three factors that influence people to <b>involve</b> <b>in</b> drug mule which are money, family’s influence, and peer’s influence. These factors as independent variable while people involvement in drug mule as dependent variable on this study. The all factors have association significant relationship with people involvement in drug mule. This is due to result of chi-square that has been used. The most factors that influence people to <b>involve</b> <b>in</b> drug mule are peer’s influence followed by money and family’s influence. In conclusion, peer’s influence, money, and family’s influence can influence people to <b>involve</b> <b>in</b> drug mule...|$|R
