5000|$|On January 19, 2007, Duncan {{accepted}} the NDP nomination in Edmonton-Strathcona, by acclamation, to again seek election to Parliament in the 40th Canadian federal election. The election campaign began in September 2008. To make environmental protection an election issue, Duncan and Jack Layton {{flew over the}} tar sands area noting environmentally damaging practices. Duncan made support for public health care, enforcement of environmental laws, and driving the economy with 'green jobs' priorities in her campaign. She drew upon support from a large volunteer network built since the last election and strategic voting from Liberal supporters. With the polls showing a close race, incumbent Conservative candidate launched an attack ad against Duncan. On election night, October 14, the results showed Jaffer as the leader, by 1,000 votes with over half the polls reporting. Jaffer delivered his victory speech around 10 p.m. and several people were calling the election a win for Jaffer. However, late polls, which included residences around the University of Alberta, put Duncan ahead. Following {{a few days of}} silence and after his fiancee, fellow Conservative Member of Parliament Helena Guergis, flew to Edmonton and quietly married him, Jaffer conceded defeat to Duncan. With a 463-vote margin, Duncan became the only non-Conservative MP in Alberta.During the ensuing 40th Canadian Parliament Duncan was appointed to the position of NDP critic on the Environment. In the Parliament's aborted first session she strongly opposed the government's proposed fiscal update, especially the proposed changes to pay <b>equity</b> <b>claims,</b> four-year wage cap, and suspension of the right to strike for federal employees. She supported the proposed coalition government and condemned the Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, for labeling the coalition government as [...] "treasonous" [...] and [...] "criminal". When Parliament resumed in January 2009, Duncan sat {{as a member of the}} House Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development. She supported Ecojustice and the Sierra Club's lawsuit against the government's waiver of federal environmental assessment reviews on infrastructure projects arguing that it required an act of Parliament, rather than the Conservative government's Order in Council. She vocally supported the opposition's Corporate Accountability of Mining, Oil and Gas Corporations in Developing Countries Act that would hold Canadian companies accountable in Canadian courts for human rights and environmental abuses committed in other countries. Duncan introduced three bills into during the second and third sessions: the first proposing that the third Friday of February be declared National Hockey Day, the second establishing an Environmental Bill of Rights, and the third would have amended the Criminal Code to restrict the use of hand-held telecommunications devices while driving. On a private member's bill to abolish the federal gun registry, Linda Duncan was the only MP from Alberta who voted against abolishing the gun registry.|$|E

40|$|With the {{increased}} sophistication of financial markets and financial instruments, {{the use of}} hybrid investments {{has been on the}} rise in recent decades. This article considers the question of how Canadian courts have drawn the border between debt and equity in the context of bankruptcy proceedings. The basic argument is that Canadian courts should allow the recent reforms to bring about their intended clarity on the border between debt and equity by not departing from the bright line test set out in the legislation. The article compares the pre and post-amendment case law and uses two case studies to illustrate the undue complexity that has been created by layering a contextual analysis on top of the new bright line tests. Simply put, in the context of investment classification decisions for the purposes of bankruptcy proceedings, Canadian courts should limit the scope of their analysis to an inquiry of whether the investment in question falls within the scope of the 2 ̆ 2 <b>equity</b> <b>claim</b> 2 ̆ 2 definition provided under Canadian bankruptcy legislation.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} motivations for and {{consequences}} of including a broad group of employees in leveraged buyouts by comparing employee buyouts (EBOs) to transactions where only top level managers participate, or management buyouts (MBOs).

A major finding is that employee participation helps to finance the buyout. The EBO allows firms {{to gain access to}} excess pension assets by converting employees' defined benefit pension capital into <b>equity</b> <b>claims,</b> thus freeing the excess assets in the pension plan to help fund the buyout. Also, employee participation substitutes <b>equity</b> <b>claims</b> for cash labor compensation costs and therefore allows the firm to borrow more than otherwise would be possible.

40|$|There is {{a secret}} paradox {{at the heart of}} social {{contract}} theories. Such theories assume that, because personal security and private property are at risk in a state of nature, subjects will agree to grant Leviathan a monopoly of violence. But what is to prevent Leviathan from turning on his subjects once they have lain down their arms? If Leviathan has the same incentives as his subjects in the Hobbesian state of nature, he will plunder them more thoroughly than ever they plundered themselves in the state of nature. Thus the social contract always leaves subjects worse off, unless Leviathan can fetter himself. And how can Leviathan bind himself, if he can always impose confiscatory taxes or choke off trade through inefficient regulations? This Article suggests that schemes of progressive taxation, in which marginal tax rates increase with taxable income, may be seen as a useful incentive strategy to bribe Leviathan from imposing inefficient regulations. Income taxes give Leviathan an <b>equity</b> <b>claim</b> in his state's economy, and progressive taxes give him a greater residual interest in upside payoffs. Leviathan will then demand a higher side payment from interest groups to impose value- destroying regulations. Of course, progressive taxation imposes its own incentive costs, by reducing the subject's private gains. However, these costs must be balanced against the gains from correcting Leviathan's misincentives, and it may that such gains exceed the costs of progressive taxation. flat tax, Hobbes, political economy, Leviathan, regulation,mandates, constitutions, progressive taxation...|$|R
