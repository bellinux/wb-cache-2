5|$|Although Dutch forces {{conquered the}} {{towns and cities}} in Republican heartlands on Java and Sumatra, they could not control villages and the countryside. Republican troops and militia led by Lt. Colonel (later President) Suharto {{attacked}} Dutch positions in Yogyakarta at dawn on 1 March 1949. The Dutch were expelled from the city <b>for</b> <b>six</b> <b>hours</b> but reinforcements were brought in from the nearby cities of Ambarawa and Semarang that afternoon.

5|$|By 17 August the encirclement was incomplete. The 1st Polish Armoured Division, {{part of the}} First Canadian Army, {{was divided}} into three battlegroups and ordered to make a wide sweep to the {{south-east}} to meet American troops at Chambois. Trun fell to the 4th Canadian Armoured Division on 18 August. Having captured Champeaux on 19 August, the Polish battlegroups converged on Chambois, and with reinforcements from the 4th Canadian Armoured Division, the Poles secured the town and linked up with the US 90th and French 2nd Armoured divisions by evening. The Allies were not yet astride the 7th Army escape route in any great strength, and their positions were attacked by German troops inside the pocket. An armoured column of the 2nd Panzer Division broke through the Canadians in St. Lambert, took half the village and kept a road open <b>for</b> <b>six</b> <b>hours</b> until nightfall. Many Germans escaped, and small parties made their way through to the Dives during the night.|$|E
5|$|By 1916, Peeler {{was living}} in the Melbourne suburb of Richmond with his wife and three daughters.

The battalion arrived in Plymouth seven weeks later. During the three months Peeler's unit spent in England undergoing additional training, he was charged with being absent without leave <b>for</b> <b>six</b> <b>hours</b> on 3 July, and fined a day's pay.

5|$|Sudirman ordered Hutagalung {{to begin}} {{planning}} a full-scale assault, in which TNI soldiers– in uniform– would attack the Dutch and show their strength {{in front of}} foreign reporters and United Nations investigative teams. Hutagalung, together with officers under his commander Colonel Bambang Sugeng and government officials under Governor Wongsonegoro, spent several days discussing ways to ensure the attack could be successful. The discussion may {{have resulted in the}} General Offensive of 1March 1949, which saw TNI soldiers attack Dutch outposts throughout central Java. Troops under Lieutenant Colonel Suharto retook Yogyakarta <b>for</b> <b>six</b> <b>hours</b> before withdrawing, a successful show of force which caused the Dutch to lose face internationally; they had previously declared the TNI eradicated. However, who truly ordered the offensive remains uncertain: Suharto and HamengkubuwanaIX claimed responsibility, while Bambang Sugeng's brother reportedly overheard him ordering the assault.|$|E
5|$|The French ships {{followed}} Swiftsure by tacking {{into the}} wind and a complicated chase developed, with Jean Bart and Constitution maintaining {{the pressure on the}} slow moving British vessel, while the rest of Ganteaume's squadron used the prevailing wind to push far ahead of the ongoing chase before tacking at 08:00 across Hallowell's intended course. Unless Hallowell could escape the trap, his ship would be caught between the two French divisions and overwhelmed. <b>For</b> <b>six</b> <b>hours</b> Hallowell continued his efforts to escape, but the French ships were too fast, Ganteaume's force passing some distance ahead of the British ship and then turning back towards him so that by 14:00 Swiftsure was at serious risk of being surrounded. Hallowell determined that his only option was to attempt to drive though those ships of Ganteaume's division that blocked his passage to leeward, the ships of the line Indivisible (under Pierre-Paulin Gourrège) and Dix-Août (under Louis-Marie Le Gouardin) and the frigate Créole.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish fleet arrived off Roatán at 6am on March 13, {{and after}} its {{defenders}} fired several ineffectual cannon shots, the Santa Maltilda {{and the other}} ships anchored out of range.

The defenders asked <b>for</b> <b>six</b> <b>hours</b> to consider their options, which Gálvez granted. After that time had elapsed MacDonell came back with word that the defenders refused to surrender and were prepared to stand their ground 'to the death'. The Spanish were not surprised as their sailors had noticed the English appeared to be preparing defenses during grace period. An Immediate attack was not possible due to high winds and rough seas, so Gálvez then held council of his eleven officers, and a plan of attack was formulated.|$|E
