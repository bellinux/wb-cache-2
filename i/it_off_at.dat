5|$|In 1902, Warner {{played one}} {{professional}} football {{game for the}} Syracuse Athletic Club during the first World Series of Football at Madison Square Garden. In the first professional indoor football game, Syracuse defeated the heavily favored New York team. During the series, Warner was seriously cut {{on the side of}} his head. Although he laughed <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> first, the injury turned out to be more serious and he was replaced with Blondy Wallace for the rest of the series. For the tournament, Warner and the other team members earned $23 (approximately $816 in 2016), although the expected share was $300 (approximately $8,000 in 2016) per player; it was a financial failure.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, {{aspiring}} musician Govind (Shahid Kapoor) {{and popular}} Bollywood superstar Ruksar (Priyanka Chopra) meet {{on a train}} heading to Bombay, India. Ruksar had run away from her home Lucknow with her best friend to become a film star. The two bond over their careers but part ways after arriving in Bombay. Govind befriends Radhika (Prachi Desai), a confident and modern girl, who is charmed by his simplicity. Ruksar and Govind meet again and hit <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> a party, but Govind notices a photo journalist following them. He holds Radhika's hand to mislead the journalist, unaware that Radhika has {{fallen in love with}} him. Radhika is the best friend Ruksar had run away with, and the two tell each other about the man they've fallen in love with, not realising he is the same person. When Ruksar, Radhika and Govind all meet, the three realise what happened and brokenheartedly part ways.|$|E
25|$|Returning {{to active}} naval service with a lucrative posting as commodore, he cruised with success off Portugal, and was then {{entrusted}} {{with a secret}} mission to capture the Cape Colony from the Dutch Republic. While {{en route to the}} Cape, he was surprised by a French force sent to thwart his goal, and though he fought <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> the Battle of Porto Praya, he allowed the French to push on and reinforce the Cape. Thwarted in his mission, he had some consolation in discovering a valuable fleet of Dutch merchants, and capturing most of them. Returning to politics in England after the war he spoke on a number of issues, but was not asked to join an administration. He became a director of the East India Company towards the end of his life, before illness forced him to retire from business and politics shortly before his death in 1787.|$|E

25|$|On the July 26 {{episode of}} Raw, Kane was denied a World Heavyweight Championship match at The Great American Bash leading him to attack {{commentators}} Michael Cole and Jerry Lawler turning heel in the process. At The Great American Bash, Kane interfered and attacked both the champion CM Punk and the challenger Batista. In September, Kane began a feud with Rey Mysterio that lasted through Survivor Series. On the March 2 episode of Raw, Kane pinned Mike Knox in a triple threat match, also involving Rey Mysterio, {{to earn a}} spot in the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania XXV, a match ultimately won by CM Punk. During the 2009 draft Kane beat The Brian Kendrick for a draft pick and, later in the night, was drafted back to SmackDown. There, Kane feuded with CM Punk and defeated him to cap <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> Backlash. He then took a break to tour India and also heal injuries, returning at The Bash to assist Dolph Ziggler in his match with The Great Khali by hitting Khali with a steel chair, allowing Ziggler to win. This started a feud with Khali, whom he defeated at SummerSlam and in a Singapore Cane match at Breaking Point. Alongside Chris Jericho, Kane was co-captain for the victorious Team SmackDown at Bragging Rights. Kane then unsuccessfully challenged Jericho in a number one contender's match for an opportunity to face World Heavyweight Champion The Undertaker and Big Show in a triple threat match at Survivor Series. In November, Kane reunited with The Undertaker to feud with Big Show and Jericho, thus becoming a face.|$|E

Stone said Cohn gave him a suitcase that Stone avoided opening and, as instructed by Cohn, dropped <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> the office of a lawyer influential in Liberal Party circles. Reagan carried the state with 46 percent of the vote. Speaking after the statute of limitations for bribery had expired, Stone said, [...] "I paid his law firm. Legal fees.

The experienced Pequeño Black Warrior, a smaller version of Black Warrior started to target the tecnico Eléctrico during a number of matches, stating after one of the matches that he wanted the young, much less experienced Eléctrico to [...] "pay his dues" [...] in the ring. The feud started out during a six-man tag team match where Pequeño Warrior began targeting Eléctrico, often tearing his young opponent's mask open, at times even pulling <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> times to gain an unfair advantage in the match. After being the victim for a number of weeks Eléctrico fought back, at least once winning the match by pulling Pequeño Black Warrior's mask off.

2500|$|The Thomas H. Gale House is one {{of three}} houses along Chicago Avenue in Oak Park, two of which belong to a group known as American {{architect}} Frank Lloyd Wright's [...] "Bootleg Houses". This trio of houses, also including the Robert P. Parker House and the Walter Gale House, were designed by Wright independently while he was still employed by Adler and Sullivan. Architect Louis Sullivan loaned Wright money during the construction of his own home and studio, and Wright was working <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> the firm; independent work was forbidden by Sullivan. The Thomas Gale house is especially similar to the Robert P. Parker House. In all, Wright designed at least eight [...] "bootleg houses" [...] moonlighting while still under contract with Sullivan. When Sullivan found out about the side projects, in late 1892 or early 1893, Wright was dismissed. The Thomas Gale House {{is one of}} at least four which still stand; sources vary as to the exact numbers.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, a {{year after}} Halliwell {{performed}} in the dress, she auctioned <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> the London branch of Sotheby's for £41,320. The buyer was Peter Morton, {{on behalf of the}} Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas, who displayed the piece of clothing as pop memorabilia. Morton bid via telephone, and beat other bidders such as The Sun. Halliwell herself watched the [...] "frenzied bid", and rapped the gavel after the final bid. The dress was originally valued at £12,000, but eventually it netted £36,200 (which, with the 15% commission, totalled it to £41,320). Halliwell gave the proceeds of the dress sale to a children's cancer care charity. The BBC commented on the sale, saying it [...] "marks the end of Geri's links with the Girl Power image of the past". It holds the Guinness World Record for the most expensive piece of popstar clothing dealt at auction. The dress was one of many items of Spice Girls memorabilia sold at the auction, where total sales reached £146,511 for charity.|$|E

2500|$|Marshall Heights {{was slow}} to develop. Much of the {{neighborhood}} remained forested countryside in 1900, {{with only a few}} dirt tracks providing access to it. [...] There was no city-provided drinking water; the neighborhood's few residents used a local stream for drinking, cooking, and cleaning water. Most streets were not actually graded by the city until 1918, with District engineers using heavy cuts through hilly areas and extensive, deep fills in valleys to complete the street grid. The grid-like street design created significant problems for homebuilders here: Some homes were constructed on the edge of steep banks in order to have access to the street, while others were as much as [...] below street level. By 1915, much of the area had been illegally settled by poor African Americans, who built shacks out of scavenged and discarded building materials. This led the area to be nicknamed [...] "Shantytown" [...] by D.C. residents. After World War I, the real estate developers who had inherited or purchased various blocks of land in Marshall Heights began selling <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> low prices. Since there were no housing covenants excluding blacks from owning property there, large numbers of African Americans began purchasing lots in Marshall Heights.|$|E
2500|$|Deputy Enos Strate (Sonny Shroyer) (1979–1980, 1982–1985, 1997, 2000) is {{a friend}} of the Dukes, but, while working for Rosco and Boss is often forced into {{pursuing}} the Dukes and/or arresting them on trumped-up charges. In the early episodes, Enos is shown to be a rather good driver (and respected as such by Bo and Luke), {{but by the end of}} the first season, he is shown to be as incompetent a driver as Rosco. When he returns from his stint in Los Angeles, he seems to be able to stand up to Boss and Rosco slightly more, and sometimes refuses to participate in their schemes. In the early episodes, Rosco frequently calls him [...] "jackass", which soon evolved into the more family-friendly [...] "dipstick" [...] as the show became a hit with younger viewers (though Boss Hogg, who would also use the term [...] "jackass" [...] of Sheriff Rosco, would occasionally return to calling Enos this in later seasons). Enos has a crush on Daisy Duke that she often uses to the Dukes' advantage in unraveling Hogg and Rosco's schemes. Enos is very much in love with Daisy, and although Daisy seems to love him back, it is supposedly only as a close friend. In the penultimate episode, [...] "Enos and Daisy's Wedding", the two plan on getting married, only to have Enos call <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> the last minute due to an attack of hives, brought on by the excitement of possibly being married to Daisy. Later, in the , Enos and Daisy become a pair again and plan to get married, but this time Daisy backs out at the last minute, upon the unexpected sight of her ex-husband.|$|E
