5|$|Galileo {{observed}} the planet Saturn, {{and at first}} mistook its rings for planets, thinking it was a three-bodied system. When he {{observed the}} planet later, Saturn's rings were directly oriented at Earth, causing him to think {{that two of the}} bodies <b>had</b> <b>disappeared.</b> The rings reappeared when he observed the planet in 1616, further confusing him.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the attacks, some news reports mistakenly reported Shehri as a trained pilot and son of a Saudi diplomat, who was still alive and well.

5|$|The Perm {{authorities}} distributed a concocted {{cover story}} that Michael was abducted by unidentified men and <b>had</b> <b>disappeared.</b> Chelyshev and Borunov were arrested. Shortly before his own arrest, Colonel Peter Znamerovsky, a former Imperial army officer also exiled to Perm, managed to send Natalia a brief telegram saying that Michael <b>had</b> <b>disappeared.</b> Znamerovsky, Chelyshev and Borunov were all {{killed by the}} Perm Bolsheviks. Soviet disinformation about Michael's disappearance led to unfounded rumours that he had escaped and was leading a successful counter-revolution. In the ultimately forlorn hope that Michael would ally with Germany, the Germans arranged for Natalia and her daughter to escape to Kiev in German-controlled Ukraine. On {{the collapse of the}} Germans in November 1918, Natalia fled to the coast, and she and her daughter were evacuated by the British Royal Navy.|$|E

5|$|A story {{tells of}} a ninth-century Rajput king, Nahar Rao Parihar of Mandore, chasing a white boar to the lake shore on a hunting expedition. In order to quench his thirst, he dipped his hand into the lake and was {{astonished}} {{to see that the}} Leukoderma marks on his hand <b>had</b> <b>disappeared.</b> Impressed with the sacred curative nature of the lake, he got the lake restored to its glory. After discovering the curative characteristics of the lake water, people have since visited the lake to take a holy dip and cure themselves of skin problems.|$|E
5|$|After 9600 BCE, the area's {{environment}} grew {{warmer and}} drier, {{a change that}} brought to central Mesa Verde pine forests and the animals that thrive in them. Paleo-Indians began inhabiting the mesa in increasing numbers , though {{it is unclear whether}} they were seasonal occupants or year-round residents. Development of the atlatl during this period made it easier for them to hunt smaller game, a crucial advance {{at a time when most}} of the region's big game <b>had</b> <b>disappeared</b> from the landscape.|$|E
5|$|As it {{was easy}} to find and kill, the quagga was hunted by early Dutch {{settlers}} and later by Afrikaners to provide meat or for their skins. The skins were traded or used locally. The quagga was probably vulnerable to extinction due to its limited distribution, and it may have competed with domestic livestock for forage. The quagga <b>had</b> <b>disappeared</b> from much of its range by the 1850s. The last population in the wild, in the Orange Free State, was extirpated in the late 1870s. The last known wild individual died in 1878.|$|E

5|$|Both serials were {{promptly}} {{released on}} iTunes, with DVD releases following {{over the next}} few months. Both on the iTunes and the DVD release, episode 3 of The Web of Fear was represented by a tele-snap reconstruction, edited by John Kelly. Episode 3 {{had been part of the}} same find, but by the end of protracted negotiations for the return of the film cans, the episode <b>had</b> <b>disappeared</b> from the cache, with the presumption that it was sold to a private collector.|$|E
5|$|By 1851, {{however, the}} {{reduction}} {{system of the}} missions <b>had</b> <b>disappeared.</b> Mestizos who {{had moved to the}} area in their quest for land began to outnumber the original indigenous population. Starting with the creation of the Province of José Miguel de Velasco in 1880, the Chiquitania was split into five administrative divisions. With the rubber boom {{at the turn of the}} century, more settlers came to the areas and established large haciendas, moving the economic activities together with the native peoples out of the towns.|$|E
5|$|During {{the twentieth}} century the Doom Bar was {{regularly}} dredged to improve access to Padstow. By the 1930s, when Commander H.E.

By 2010 the original channel <b>had</b> <b>disappeared.</b> The estuary is regularly dredged by Padstow Harbour Commission's dredgers, Sandsnipe and Mannin.|$|E

5|$|Following its cinema release, {{the film}} was {{transferred}} to VHS in 1991 in a pan and scan edition. However, when Glyn Watkins, a poet who had been encouraged by J.L.

5|$|In 1929, Walter Lowenfels jokingly {{suggested}} that Aldington should {{produce a new}} Imagist anthology. Aldington, by now a successful novelist, took up the suggestion and {{enlisted the help of}} Ford and H.D. The result was the Imagist Anthology 1930, edited by Aldington and including all the contributors to the four earlier anthologies with the exception of Lowell, who had died, Cannell, who <b>had</b> <b>disappeared,</b> and Pound, who declined. The appearance of this anthology initiated a critical discussion of the place of the Imagists in the history of 20th-century poetry.|$|E
5|$|Melvin's {{first problem}} {{was that there was}} no {{forensic}} evidence. Senior officers had not allowed the estate to be sealed off immediately after the attack, which meant that the crime scene had not been secured. Witnesses and those directly involved were able to leave without giving their names. Objects that might have held fingerprints were not collected. Police were not allowed into the estate in great numbers until 4am, by which time much of the evidence <b>had</b> <b>disappeared.</b> Whatever remained was removed during Haringey Council's clean-up operation.|$|E

5|$|The Tora {{hartebeest}} {{is listed}} as Critically Endangered; the IUCN has ascertained that fewer than 250 mature individuals survive as of 2008.

There have been unconfirmed reports of sightings by locals of the Tora hartebeest southeast of the Dinder National Park, from where it <b>had</b> <b>disappeared</b> before 1960.|$|E
5|$|The {{fate of the}} D-21 that <b>had</b> <b>disappeared</b> on {{the first}} {{operational}} flight was finally revealed in February 1986 when an official from the CIA returned a panel to Ben Rich {{that he had been}} given by a Soviet KGB agent.
