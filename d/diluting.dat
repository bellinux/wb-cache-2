5|$|Dunstan pursued similar reforms {{with respect}} to Indigenous Australians. In 1962, the Aboriginal Affairs Bill was {{introduced}} to liberalise constraints that had been placed on Indigenous Australians {{in the past and}} had effectively resulted in segregation. The initial proposal still retained some restrictions, placing more controls over full-blooded Aborigines. Dunstan was prominent in Labor's opposition to the double standards, and called for abolition of race-based restrictions, saying that social objectives could be achieved without explicit colour-based schemes. He was successful in forcing amendments to liberalise controls on property and the confinement of Indigenous Australians to reserves. However, his attempt to remove the different standards required of part and full-blooded Aborigines failed, as did his proposal to ensure that {{at least half of the}} members of the Aboriginal Affairs Board be Indigenous Australians. Despite the passage of the bill, restrictions remained in place and Dunstan questioned the policy of assimilation of Aborigines, which he saw as the <b>diluting</b> of their distinctive cultures.|$|E
5|$|During this period, royalist forces made {{advances}} into New Granada, {{which they}} controlled from 1815 to 1819, and into Chile, which they controlled from 1814 to 1817. Except for royalist {{areas in the}} northeast and south, the provinces of New Granada had maintained independence from Spain since 1810, unlike neighboring Venezuela, where royalists and pro-independence forces had exchanged control of the region several times. To pacify Venezuela and to retake New Granada, Spain organized in 1815 the largest armed force it ever sent to the New World, consisting of 10,500 troops and nearly sixty ships. (See, Spanish reconquest of New Granada.) Although this force was crucial in retaking a solidly pro-independence region like New Granada, its soldiers were eventually spread out throughout Venezuela, New Granada, Quito, and Peru and were lost to tropical diseases, <b>diluting</b> their impact on the war. More importantly, the majority of the royalist forces were composed, not of soldiers sent from the peninsula, but of Spanish Americans.|$|E

Eidos marketing manager David Burton oversaw marketing efforts, which attempted {{to portray the}} character as attractive and pleasant. However, interaction with the press, especially those in Europe, resulted in less clothing depicted in promotional images. Concerned with <b>diluting</b> Croft's personality, Eidos avoided products it felt did not fit the character. Ian Livingstone, Eidos's product acquisition director, commented that the company declines most merchandising proposals. He stated that Eidos primarily focused on game development and viewed such promotion outside video games as exposure for the character. Following Square Enix's acquisition, Eidos's marketing duties were transferred to the Square Enix Europe subsidiary.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} order to study the possibility of compensatory growth by changing dietary nutrients concentration in the female Arian broiler chicks using a completely randomized design by means of standard and <b>diluted</b> diets.

Feed consumption and feed conversion ratio of these treatments were statistically lower than other treatment groups. Furthermore, production index and percentage of mortality was better than other treatment groups. Likewise, viscera% and abdominal fat% remained significantly constant in all treatment groups.

5|$|Retrospective {{coverage}} of Burnout 3: Takedown has been overwhelmingly favourable, with many publications considering {{it to be}} among the best games released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox consoles, as well {{as one of the greatest}} racing games ever made. Edge magazine called the game a pivotal moment for the series and reflected positively on the fundamental changes that had Criterion made in designing it. They praised the game for being balanced all round while noting that later instalments like Revenge and Dominator had pushed the series too far in a particular direction, consequently <b>diluting</b> a lot of what Burnout 3 had accomplished. IGN reaffirmed these thoughts in 2015, by declaring the game as the most perfect arcade racer ever conceived and the peak of the series.

5|$|As Lucas' {{business}} prospers, {{he makes}} a point of operating quietly and dressing with a modest conservatism both as a sign of strength and to avoid attracting police attention. Also, he stays away from the drugs to avoid making hard decisions under the influence. However, Lucas violates these principles when he attends the Fight of the Century with Eva, sporting gaudy clothes that were a present by Eva; Roberts attends the fight, notices the previously unknown Lucas with even better seats than the Italian mobsters, and investigates him. Meanwhile, Lucas needs to deal with Lucchese mafia boss Dominic Cattano, who threatens to destroy Lucas' family unless he gets in on a deal, and corrupt NYPD detectives led by Nick Trupo, who attempts to extort and blackmail him to give them a cut. Lucas must also compete with local crime figure Nicky Barnes, a young gun trying to take over Harlem who has been <b>diluting</b> Lucas' Blue Magic and selling it under the same brand name.

40|$|AbstractThree {{proteins}} {{have been}} described in humans and mice as being essential for even distribution, transport, and translocation of pigment granules, with defects in these molecules giving rise to lighter skin/coat color. The <b>dilute</b> phenotype in domestic cats affects both eumelanin and phaeomelanin pigment pathways; for example, black pigmentation combined with <b>dilute</b> appears gray and orange pigments appear cream. The <b>dilute</b> pigmentation segregates as a fully penetrant, autosomal recessive trait. We conducted classical linkage mapping with microsatellites in a large multigeneration pedigree of domestic cats and detected tight linkage for <b>dilute</b> on cat chromosome C 1 (θ= 0. 08, LOD= 10. 81). Fine-mapping identified a genomic region exhibiting conserved synteny to human chromosome 2, which included {{one of the three}} <b>dilute</b> candidate genes, melanophilin (MLPH). Sequence analysis in <b>dilute</b> cats identified a single base pair deletion in exon 2 of MLPH transcripts that introduces a stop codon 11 amino acids downstream, resulting in the truncation of the bulk of the MLPH protein. The occurrence of this homozygous variant in 97 unrelated <b>dilute</b> cats representing 26 cat breeds and random-bred cats, along with 89 unrelated wild-type cats representing 29 breeds and random-bred cats, supports the finding that <b>dilute</b> is caused by this single mutation in MLPH (p< 0. 00001). Single-nucleotide polymorphism analyses in <b>dilute</b> individuals identified a single haplotype in <b>dilute</b> cats, suggesting that a single mutation event in MLPH gave rise to <b>dilute</b> in domestic cats...|$|R

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{aimed to}} investigate the effects of early dietary energy and protein dilution on growth performance, nutrient utilization and internal organs of broilers. Of Arbor Acres, 1200 day-old male chicks were selected and randomly distributed to 16 experimental groups with factorial arrangement (4 × 4) including 4 levels of energy dilution and 4 of protein dilution (8 to 14 d of age). Birds were fed the same diets during the other period. Experiment of nutrient utilization was carried out 11 to 14 d of age. At 14 d, 1 bird/pen was slaughtered to determine internal organs. From 8 to 14 d, average daily feed intake (ADFI) of treatments protein <b>diluted</b> 10 % was significantly less than of treatments protein <b>diluted</b> 20 % (P< 0. 05). Feed conversion ratio (FCR) of treatments protein <b>diluted</b> 30 % and energy <b>diluted</b> 15 % was significantly less than other treatments (P< 0. 05).
