The investigation described attempts to enlarge current knowledge on the high-temperature behaviour of <b>grey</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> in view of requirements highlighted by high thermal ratings. A general considera-tion of the problem showed that the often quoted Eichelberg material-quality factor is largely irrelevant and an alternative assessment formula is proposed. This is broadly confirmed by a systematic examination of the mechanical and physical properties of 166 plain and alloyed <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> and a limited number of engine com-ponents. Different engine components impose different demands upon the material properties but for economic reasons a single cast-iron melt capable of meeting most of the requirements of all components is needed. It is shown that this situation is best met with an alloyed iron containing 1. 3 per cent of copper-nickel and 0. 4 per cent of molybdenum. The scatter in properties obtained from production casts was found to be typical for such irons. For components having safety factors of 2 or less, a prerequisite of economic engineering design, the service reliability is crucially dependent upon the scatter of material properties. Thus, there are advantages in reducing this scatter and it is shown that th is can be achieved by attention to the cleanliness of the matrix and tight control of the chemistry of the melt. In general, the absolute values of mechanical and physical properties of flake-graphite <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> appear to be governed mainly by the form and size of the graphite flakes and the chemistry of the matrix (i. e.

40|$|Abstract. In this {{experimental}} study, six pearlitic <b>grey</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> {{with different}} Cu and Cr content, different section thicknesses and different eutectoid cooling {{rates have been}} examined. The eutectoid cooling rate was approximated by casting simulation analysis. The purpose of the experiments was to study {{the effect of the}} matrix structure on the overall mechanical properties. An emphasis is put on the pearlite interlamellar spacing because this controls the resulting mechanical properties to a large extent. By keeping the graphite structure constant, the effect of the matrix structure was able to be studied. This was achieved by shake-out at temperatures above the eutectoid transformation range followed by subsequent cooling in air, mould or in a furnace. The pearlite interlamellar spacing ranged from 90 to 330 nm for the matrices studied. Comparing the strength of the fine structured and coarse structured materials, the tensile and yield strength was reduced by almost 50 %. Regarding the elastic deformation, a weak increase in the tangent modulus with increasing alloying content was observed. It was also observed that lower cooling rate decreased the tangent modulus. The tangent modulus ranged between 70 and 110 GPa. Analysing the plastic deformation of the materials, in terms of strain hardening exponent, n, and strength coefficient, K, a strong dependence on the pearlite coarseness was observed. It was concluded that the effect of graphite particle length on tensile strength was negligible and the major improvement on the strength was due to refinement of the pearlite...|$|R

High power, medium frequency coreless induction furnaces are commonly used in electric melting grey iron foundries. This has resulted in low sulphur (1, 500 °C), contributing to unfavourable conditions for graphite nucleation. Thin wall castings are increasingly produced by these electric melt shops with a risk of greater eutectic undercooling during solidification. The paper focused on two groups of <b>grey</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> and their specific problems: carbides and graphite morphology control in lower carbon equivalent high strength irons (CE= 3. 4 %- 3. 8 %), and austenite dendrite promotion in eutectic and slightly hypereutectic irons (CE= 4. 1 %- 4. 5 %), {{in order to increase}} their strength characteristics. There are 3 stages and 3 steps involving graphite formation, iron chemistry and iron processing that appear to be important. The concept in the present paper sustains a threestage model for nucleating flake graphite [(Mn,X) S type nuclei]. There are three important groups of elements (deoxidizer, Mn/S, and inoculant) and three technological stages in electric melting of iron (superheat, pre-conditioning of base iron, final inoculation). Attention is drawn to a control factor (%Mn) x (%S) ensuring it equals to 0. 03 – 0. 06, accompanied by 0. 005 wt. %– 0. 010 wt. % Al and/or Zr content in inoculated irons. It was found that iron powder addition promotes austenite dendrite formation in eutectic and slightly eutectic, acting as reinforcement for the eutectic cells. But, there is an accompanying possible negative influence on the characteristics of the (Mn,X) S type graphite nuclei (change the morphology of nuclei from polygonal compact to irregular polygonal, and therefore promote chill tendency in treated irons).
