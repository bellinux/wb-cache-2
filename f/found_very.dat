5|$|During {{the postwar}} era, Indiana became a {{critical}} swing state that often helped decide which party controlled the presidency. Elections were very close, {{and became the}} center of frenzied attention with many parades, speeches and rallies as election day approached; voter turnout ranging over 90% to near 100% in such elections as 1888 and 1896. In remote areas, both sides paid their supporters to vote, and occasionally paid supporters of the opposition not to vote. Despite allegations, historians have <b>found</b> <b>very</b> little fraud in national elections.|$|E
5|$|In August 1969, Canadian Forces Maritime Command divers {{made more}} dives during {{scientific}} {{studies by the}} Fisheries Research Board of Canada. They <b>found</b> <b>very</b> dense shoals of rockfish floating over Bowie's flat-topped summit {{and a variety of}} bottom life. A number of monochrome photographs were taken and a few seaweeds were collected, but no species record was created for other types of oceanic life around Bowie Seamount.|$|E
5|$|Around Storybrooke, {{residents}} {{notice the}} clock tower's hands moving. Regina (Lana Parrilla) {{looks through the}} book of fairy tales and discovers that the last few pages are torn out. She confronts Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), who lies and says that the pages are missing {{because it is an}} old book. Regina learns Emma is still in town when the clock's hands move forward. Believing that Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) will try to take Henry away from her, Regina encourages Emma to leave town. Regina meets with The Daily Mirror editor, Sidney Glass (Giancarlo Esposito), who has run a front-page story about Emma's auto accident which portrays Emma in a poor light, but tells Regina that he has <b>found</b> <b>very</b> little of interest in Emma's past.|$|E
5000|$|Given {{the fact}} that Arabs <b>founded</b> <b>very</b> few cities in the regions they conquered, {{a large portion of}} cities in Arab {{countries}} have non-Arab etymologies. Many places, however, have had their names changed and [...] "Arabized." [...] The following toponymic elements are common in place names in the Maghreb: ...|$|R
30|$|Helium is {{the second}} element in the universe, after hydrogen. It is <b>found</b> in <b>very</b> high amounts in the stars. In the earth, helium can be <b>found</b> in <b>very</b> low {{quantities}} in the atmosphere and in natural gas fields, {{or it can be}} extracted from cleveite, a mineral found in uranium deposits.|$|R
50|$|The town of Chrastava {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in 1351 as Craczauia. It was <b>founded</b> <b>very</b> {{probably in the}} end of the 13th century on the site of an older village of the West Slavic Milceni tribe by German settlers, having been invited by King Ottokar II of Bohemia. They came mainly from the city Pirna in Saxony.|$|R
5|$|The {{length of}} time taken for the {{extinction}} to occur is a controversial issue, because some theories about the extinction's causes require a rapid extinction over {{a relatively short period}} (from a few years to a few thousand years) while others require longer periods. The issue is difficult to resolve because of the Signor–Lipps effect; that is, the fossil record is so incomplete that most extinct species probably died out long after the most recent fossil that has been found. Scientists have also <b>found</b> <b>very</b> few continuous beds of fossil-bearing rock that cover a time range from several million years before the K–Pg extinction to a few million years after it. The sedimentation rate and thickness of K-Pg clay from three sites suggest short duration of event, perhaps less than ten thousand years.|$|E
5|$|Chopra saw {{the deal}} as an {{opportunity}} to represent South Asians and break Indian stereotypes in Hollywood and the United States in general. In the process, she became the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series. She revealed that when she was in school , she never saw anyone on television who looked like her, and she found it really weird because she thought there were so many people of South Asian descent in America and {{in other parts of the}} world. She also revealed that she did not want to be a stereotype of what Indians were usually seen as in global pop culture, saying that Indians never talk like Apu from The Simpsons. After signing the deal and being given all the 26 pilot scripts that ABC was developing for the 2015–2016 television season, Chopra chose Quantico. Having appeared in over fifty films at that time, the series was also Chopra's first ever audition, which she <b>found</b> <b>very</b> new and nerve-wracking at the same time.|$|E
25|$|A 2016 review <b>found</b> <b>very</b> little {{evidence}} supporting {{any of the}} claims of Fast ForWord and other commercial products, as their task-specific effects fail to generalise to other tasks.|$|E

25|$|He {{sought to}} avoid {{mistakes}} by gathering as many manuscripts {{as he could}} for checking the texts. He claimed to have corrected 5000 mistakes between two editions of Pliny the Elder's Naturalis historia, a work he <b>found</b> <b>very</b> similar to Materia Medica, for which he used at least two editions as well.|$|E
25|$|The Five-Star Quality Rating System for Medicare Advantage Plans rates Medicare Advantage (MA) {{plans on}} a scale of 1 - 5 stars. There are {{different}} domains for MA plans versus Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs). Health economist Uwe Reinhardt reviewed the academic literature and <b>found</b> <b>very</b> little solid information on which to compare traditional Medicare to Medicare Advantage.|$|E

The section has been, since it was <b>founded,</b> <b>very</b> active on all levels - Local, National and International, having had several National Representatives {{representing}} Finland on the international level, and also having had board members in the ESN International board, the most prestige duties within the ESN organization.|$|R
25|$|The {{description}} given {{above is}} taken from males and females of wet-season broods. Specimens of the dry-season broods are paler on the upperside with, in the male only anticiliary black lines to the wings. On the underside the markings on the wings will, on careful examination, be <b>found</b> <b>very</b> similar but paler brown and all very much reduced in width so that a greater extent of the white ground colour is visible.|$|E
25|$|The main {{criticism}} {{applied to}} the yeast two-hybrid screen of protein–protein interactions are {{the possibility of a}} high number of false positive (and false negative) identifications. The exact rate of false positive results is not known, but earlier estimates were as high as 70%. This also, partly, explains the often <b>found</b> <b>very</b> small overlap in results when using a (high throughput) two-hybrid screening, especially when using different experimental systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{rediscovery of}} the Nepōhualtzintzin {{was due to}} the Mexican {{engineer}} David Esparza Hidalgo, who in his wanderings throughout Mexico found diverse engravings and paintings of this instrument and reconstructed several of them made in gold, jade, encrustations of shell, etc. There have also been <b>found</b> <b>very</b> old Nepōhualtzintzin attributed to the Olmec culture, and even some bracelets of Mayan origin, as well as a diversity of forms and materials in other cultures.|$|E

25|$|There {{are quite}} regular records of live and {{stranded}} leatherback turtle {{in and around}} the Irish Sea. This species travels north to the waters off the British Isles every year following the swarms of jellyfish that form its prey. Loggerhead turtle, Ridley sea turtle and green turtle are <b>found</b> <b>very</b> occasionally in the Irish Sea but are generally unwell or dead when discovered. They have strayed or been swept out of their natural range further south into colder waters.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, the DoD IG {{produced}} a final report of its investigation {{that had been}} prompted by Roark & the others in 2002. The report basically agreed with their assertions and <b>found</b> <b>very</b> serious flaws at NSA. For a time, the NSA was even banned from starting projects over a certain size, for fear it would waste the money. However, there were no plans to release this DoD IG report {{to the public at}} the time.|$|E
25|$|Other {{completely}} {{different approach to}} microscopy is electron microscope (EM), which gives a beam of electrons {{in order to be}} focused onto the desired specimen with a design capable of giving a magnifying power up to 100,000 times.6 Electron microscopes are also used but very little when compared to light microscopes. (TEM) transmission electron microscope is more difficult to use and requires more sample preparation than scanning electron microscope (SEM) and thus have <b>found</b> <b>very</b> few applications in forensic science.|$|E

But then it was {{completely}} out of sorts and I <b>found</b> that <b>very</b> difficult as far as Timeless was concerned. Timeless was made first and then [...] "Inner City Life" [...] came out of it and I always <b>found</b> it <b>very</b> difficult that no one wanted to play it on radio and didn't want to give it the air time." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{mention of}} the existence of Manneken Pis can be found in an administrative text, dating from 1451–1452, about the water lines supplying the fountains of Brussels. From the beginning, the fountain played an essential role in the distribution of drinking water. It stood on a column and poured water into a double rectangular basin of stone. The only representations of this first statue can be <b>found,</b> <b>very</b> schematically, in a painting by Denis Van Alsloot, representing the Brussels' Ommegang of 1615 and in a preparatory drawing to this painting.|$|E
25|$|L. quietus {{is found}} growing {{exclusively}} {{at the base}} of oak trees, solitarily or in scattered groups, in soil. It can be <b>found</b> <b>very</b> commonly throughout autumn months. It is ectomycorrhizal, feeding symbiotically exclusively with oak, though studies have suggested it is also able to feed saprotrophically, growing from organic soil matter. L. quietus can be found only in Europe; in the United Kingdom, {{it is one of the}} one hundred most commonly encountered mushroom species. L. quietus var. incanus is found commonly in eastern North America.|$|E
25|$|Brown then {{considers}} the biogeographic affinities of the region, emphasising the {{close relationship between}} the Swan River Colony flora and that of King George Sound and Lucky Bay on the south coast. On the other hand, he <b>found</b> <b>very</b> few species {{in common with the}} east coast at similar latitudes. Focussing on Proteaceae, he reiterates the assertion first made in his 1814 General remarks, geographical and systematical, on the botany of Terra Australis, that the flora of the west coast of Australia has a strong South African element, whereas the flora of the east coast has a strong South American element.|$|E
