If X is a Riemann {{surface and}} P {{is a point}} on X with local {{coordinate}} z, there is a unique holomorphic differential 1-form ω with a <b>double</b> <b>pole</b> at P, so that the singular part of ω is z−2dz near P, and regular everywhere else, such that ω is square integrable on the complement of a neighbourhood of P and the real part of ω is exact on X \ {P}.
