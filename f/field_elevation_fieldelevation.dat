40|$|Several factors {{contribute}} {{to the need for}} sprinkler flow rate regulators. This NebGuide discusses them. Many center pivot irrigation systems operate on undulating terrain. Systems operated on undulating terrain experience large pressure differences in the pivot pipeline. Since water distributed by each sprinkler is determined by the pressure in the pipeline, water applied by these systems can be non-uniform. Pressure regulating devices that equalize the flow of water from individual sprinklers have become more common since uniform water application may save water and increase overall crop production. When installing a sprinkler package on a new system or replacing sprinklers on an existing system, it is important to evaluate the impact of <b>field</b> <b>elevation</b> changes on sprinkler flow rate...|$|R

Most countries (Far East, North and South America, all of Europe, Africa, Australia) use the airport's AMSL (above mean sea level) elevation as a reference. During approaches to landing, there are several other references that are used, including AFE (above <b>field</b> <b>elevation)</b> which is height referencing the highest point on the airfield, TDZE (touchdown zone elevation) or TH (threshold height) which both refer to the elevation of the landing end of the runway measured AMSL and AGL respectively.|$|R
50|$|GRU has two {{parallel}} runways. Runway 09R/27L is 9843 ft long and 148 ft wide, while runway 09L/27R is 12140 ft long and 60 m wide, after being widened in 2015 to better receive the Airbus A380. The <b>field</b> <b>elevation</b> {{at the airport}} is 2459 ft above mean sea level. Runway 09R/27L is used preferentially for landings and runway 09L/27R preferentially for takeoffs, but the Airbus A380 uses the longer and wider latter runway for both landing and taking off. There are high-speed exit taxiways on both runways that allow for traffic to depart the runway at higher speed to allow better efficiency for landing and takeoff traffic. As of 2014, there was an average of 650 takeoff and landing operations per day at the airport.|$|R
