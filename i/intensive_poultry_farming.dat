40|$|Intensification {{of animal}} {{production}} {{can be an}} important factor in the emergence of infectious diseases because changes in production structure influence disease transmission patterns. In 2004 and 2005, Thailand was subject to two highly pathogenic avian influenza epidemic waves and large surveys were conducted of the poultry sector, providing detailed spatial data on various poultry types. This study analysed these data with the aim of establishing the distributions of extensive and <b>intensive</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>farms,</b> {{based on the number of}} birds per holder. Once poultry data were disaggregated into these two production systems, they were analysed in relation to anthropogenic factors using simultaneous autoregressive models. Intensive chicken production was clustered around the capital city of Bangkok and close to the main consumption and export centres. Intensively-raised ducks, mainly free-grazing, showed a distinct pattern with the highest densities distributed in a large area located in the floodplain of the Chao Phraya River. Accessibility to Bangkok, the percentage of irrigated areas and human population density were the most important predictors explaining the geographical distribution of intensively-raised poultry. The distribution of extensive poultry showed a higher predictability. Extensive <b>poultry</b> <b>farms</b> were distributed more homogeneously across the country and their distribution was best predicted by human population density.

As these drugs are also important in treating infections in humans, their use in poultry has been restricted in some countries to avoid the development of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. In this work, a novel simple and efficient LC-MS/MS method using solid phase extraction (SPE), ESI ionization and multiple reaction mode (MRM) has been developed and validated to determine the two most common FQ residues: enrofloxacin (ENR) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) in chicken target tissues (muscle, liver, kidney, fat and skin) and in plasma. The method is shown to be sensitive, with limits of quantification (LOQ) between 1 ng g(- 1) and 5 ng g(- 1), recoveries 93 - 115 % and correlation coefficients greater than 0. 99. This novel methodology allows faster and simpler sample workflow compared to previously reported methodologies, making it ideal for high-throughput screening and confirmation of both ENR and CIP meeting the international regulation levels...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the consequences of}} the spatial heterogeneity of atmospheric ammonia (NH 3) by measuring and modelling NH 3 concentrations and deposition at 25 m grid resolution for a rural landscape containing <b>intensive</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>farming,</b> agricultural grassland, woodland and moorland. The emission pattern gave rise to a high spatial variability of modelled mean annual NH 3 concentrations and dry deposition. Largest impacts were predicted for woodland patches located within the agricultural area, while larger moorland areas were at low risk, due to atmospheric dispersion, prevailing wind direction and low NH 3 background. These high resolution spatial details are lost in national scale estimates at 1 km resolution due to less detailed emission input maps. The results demonstrate how the spatial arrangement of sources and sinks is critical to defining the NH 3 risk to semi-natural ecosystems. These spatial relationships provide the foundation for local spatial planning approaches to reduce environmental impacts of atmospheric NH 3...|$|E

Pathogen contamination of farming environments can be prevented using proper health care products such as disinfectants. This study evaluated the efficiency of commonly used disinfectants against bacteria occurring in <b>intensive</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>farming</b> environments in Imo State, Nigeria. The efficacy of six commercial disinfectants namely; Izal ®, Z-germicide ®, Diskol ®, Virkon ®, Vox ® and CID 20 ® in reducing the number of micro-organisms was assessed. Among the tested disinfectants, Virkon ® (oxidizing agents) was the most efficient, reducing the micro-organisms by 95 %. The in vitro test carried out to verify the effectiveness of disinfectants did not consider the adverse conditions found in the poultry farms. Therefore, the evaluation of the efficacy of on-farm reconstituted disinfectants over time was also carried out.

This paradigm is used to infer epidemiological interactions {{in the context of}} Avian Influenza Virus (AIV) maintenance and spread at the interface between wild and domestic birds in a southern African ecosystem. We counted and sampled waterfowl community every two months during two years in the Chivero-Manyame catchment, an important wetland of Zimbabwe. We used the overlap in space and time of bird communities combined with ecological dynamic and non-dynamic risk factors to evaluate a risk of AIV maintenance in waterfowl and a risk of transmission of AIV to the domestic populations (backyard and <b>intensive</b> <b>poultry,</b> <b>farmed</b> ostriches) through the identification of potential ''bridge species''. We tested the validity of this risk model using: 1) AIV prevalence data in the waterfowl community estimated in parallel with counting; 2) AIV prevalence data in bridge species identified. The waterfowl risk identified is related to the AIV prevalence but with time lag. Prevalence in the potential bridge species indicates that some of them can play a role as bridge species in the ecosystem. We believe this protocol is a) reproducible using available bird census data and useful to explore AIV risk and identify wild bird species potentially acting as reservoir or spreader of pathogens at a local scale; b) {{can be used as a}} management tool to improve surveillance at a local level.

40|$|ABSTRACT Ventilation {{systems are}} {{incorporated}} at <b>intensive</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>farms</b> to control environment conditions and thermal comfort of broilers. The ventilation system operates based on environmental data, particularly measured by sensors of temperature and relative humidity. Sensors are placed at different {{positions of the}} facility. Quality, number and positioning of the sensors are critical factors to achieve an efficient performance of the system. For this reason, a strategic positioning of the sensors associated to controllers could support the maintenance {{and management of the}} microclimate inside the facility. This research aims to identify the three most representative points for the positioning of sensors in order to support the ventilation system during the critical period from 12 h 00 to 15 h 00 on summer days. Temperature, relative humidity and wind speed were measured in four different tunnel ventilated barns at the final stage of the production cycle. The descriptive analysis was performed on these data. The Temperature and Humidity Index (THI) was also calculated. Then, the geostatistical analysis of THI was performed by GS+ and the position of sensors was determined by ordinary kriging. The methodology was able to detect the most representative points for the positioning of sensors in a case study (southeastern Brazil). The results suggested that this strategic positioning would help controllers to obtain a better inference of the microclimate during the studied period (the hottest microclimate), considered critical in Brazil. In addition, these results allow developing a future road map for a decision support system based on 24 h monitoring of the ventilation systems in broiler houses...|$|R
40|$|Since {{its recent}} {{discovery}} in November 2015, the mcr- 1 gene has been detected {{in a variety}} of Enterobacteriaceae from humans, animals and the environment. In Italy, only a few reports describing the presence of mcr- 1 gene in pathogenic and commensal Escherichia coli isolates from humans and poultry have been published to date. Mcr- 1 is a plasmid-borne gene encoding for the phosphoethanolamine transferase conferring resistance to colistin, which is considered a life-saving antibiotic for humans. In poultry, colistin is widely used for treating or preventing bacterial infections. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the presence of the mcr- 1 gene in Avian Pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) isolated from <b>intensive</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>farms.</b> The screening was carried out on a collection of non-repetitive APEC isolated from organs and tissues collected from commercial poultry, showing lesions suggestive of colibacillosis. A total of 229 APEC strains, collected between 2008 and 2012, were screened to detect the presence of the mcr- 1 gene. In detail, strains were isolated from turkeys (n= 109), broilers (n= 98), and layer hens (n= 22). To detect the presence of the mcr- 1 gene, a PCR to amplify an internal fragment of 308 bp was performed. Afterwards, the whole mcr- 1 gene was sequenced using a different set of primers amplifying a fragment of 1, 600 bp. PCR protocols were carried out according to the publication of Liu and colleagues (2016). Finally, strains with a confirmed presence of the mcr- 1 gene were analysed by Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing guidelines (EUCAST, 2016).

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the impact of land use system and N loadings to the environment estimated from N budgets on quality of stream water in Hokkaido, Japan. A case study was carried out in three towns of southern Hokkaido, which are Shiraoi, Yakumo, and Shizunai, characterized by <b>intensive</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>farming</b> (IPF), dairy cattle farming (DCF), and race horse farming (RHF), respectively. The estimation of N budgets using an N flow model indicated that the highest disposal N (880 Mg N yr- 1) was generated in the IPF town and it resulted in 250 kg ha- 1 yr- 1 surplus N in croplands. The disposal N was much lower in the DCF and the RHF town (102 and 71 Mg N yr- 1, respectively) than that of the IPF town. Cropland surplus N in DCF town was 31 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1, whereas RHF town had negative N balance. The linear regression analysis indicated that NO 3 -N concentration in stream water was significantly correlated with the proportion of upland field in drainage basins. The regression slopes varied among the towns, and it was the highest for IPF (0. 040), intermediate for DCF (0. 023) and the lowest for RHF town (0. 006). The multiple regression analysis showed that regression slopes were significantly correlated (R 2 = 0. 77 at 5 % level) with livestock disposal N and cropland surplus N. Therefore, we assumed that these regression lines were the baselines for non-point source pollution, and the regression slopes were determined to act as impact factors of stream water quality. However, two sampling sites in the IPF area were scattered above the baseline. This fact strongly suggests that the area was affected by point source pollution...|$|E
40|$|The {{main source}} of {{atmospheric}} ammonia (NH 3) in Scotland is livestock agriculture, which accounts for 85 % of emissions. The local magnitude of emissions therefore depends on livestock density, type, and management, with major differences occurring {{in various parts of}} Scotland. Local differences in agricultural activities therefore result {{in a wide range of}} NH 3 emissions, ranging from less than 0. 2 kg N ha− 1 year− 1 in remote areas of the Scottish Highlands to over 100 kg N ha− 1 year− 1 in areas with <b>intensive</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>farming.</b> Scotland can be divided loosely into upland and lowland areas, with NH 3 emission being less than and more than 5 kg N ha− 1 year− 1, respectively. Many semi-natural ecosystems in Scotland are vulnerable to nitrogen deposition, including bogs, moorlands, and the woodland ground flora. Because NH 3 emissions occur in the rural environment, the local deposition to sensitive ecosystems may be large, making it essential to assess the spatial distribution of NH 3 emissions and deposition. A spatial model is applied here to map NH 3 emissions and these estimates are applied in atmospheric dispersion and deposition models to estimate atmospheric concentrations of NH 3 and NH 4 +, dry deposition of NH 3, and wet deposition of NHx. Although there is a high level of local variability, modelled NH 3 concentrations show good agreement with the National Ammonia Monitoring Network, while wet deposition is largest at high altitude sites in the south and west of Scotland. Comparison of the modelled NHx deposition fields with estimated thresholds for environmental effects (“critical loads”) shows that thresholds are exceeded across most of lowland Scotland and the Southern Uplands. Only in the cleanest parts of the north and west is nitrogen deposition not a cause for concern. Given that the most intense effects occur within a few kilometres of sources, it is suggested that local spatial abatement policies would be a useful complement to traditional policies that mitigate environmental effects based on emission reduction technologies...|$|E
40|$|Poultry farming {{may provide}} {{an answer to}} the problem of nourishing the rapidly {{increasing}} populations in developing countries, especially those with mushrooming urban areas. To help meet the food needs of city dwellers, battery farms modelled on those in industrialized countries have been developed over the last twenty years with considerable success. Poultry farming in rural areas, however, remains highly traditional and has hardly been improved {{despite the fact that it}} still provides the bulk of production. Although most farming households in Africa generally keep a few chickens, poultry breeding remains for them only a secondary activity. It simply enables some ready cash to be brought in when needed by selling off a little of the capital that such birds represent for most farmers. Of more importance is the social significance of such flocks, given the fact that chickens are traditionally used as presents or tokens of exchange and make up the main dish that is served during certain festivities. Poultry consumption in rural areas is however, generally limited to such festive occasions and is estimated to be no more than one or two chickens per person per year. As for eggs, their consumption is severely limited by food habits and certain taboos. Under these conditions, poultry farming remains a supplementary source of income and thus must not incur any additional costs. It is almost like having a flock of wild birds as there are no breeding costs and they maintain themselves on readily available resources. These free-range chickens feed on kitchen waste, crop leftovers, grain residues, insects and some grass in the rainy season. Farmers occasionally trap termites for young chickens, but it is extremely rare to feed them grain. The birds are left to roam during the day, either within or around the yard. At night, they are kept inside wattle or straw roosts which are often very small, badly aired and rarely cleaned or repaired. Birds of different species and ages are bunched together indiscriminately under conditions favouring the spread of diseases. Furthermore, eggs are hatched without supervision and are seldom collected. Under these conditions poultry farmers suffer high losses. The birds are attacked by predators, eggs get broken or lost, and chicks often die before they are two months old. Their numbers are regularly reduced by parasites and respiratory diseases. Viral infections such as Newcastle disease are particularly common during the dry season. Their numbers also fluctuate considerably, being higher during the rainy season when climatic conditions are more favourable, and lower during the dry season when mortality is higher and more of them are sold. Most of these flocks consist of native chickens which have long interbred with European breeds. They are generally known as 'African chickens','running chickens' or 'country chickens'. They are usually small and of various colours, and they weigh approximately one kilo when they are sold at the age of six to eight months. A hen lays between 50 and 90 eggs a year. Although such production is relatively low, these birds have the advantage of being very sturdy, resistant to tough climatic conditions and good breeders. Apart from chickens, one also finds guinea fowl that have been domesticated from the various wild strains of the savannah regions. Their genetic adaptation to the local environment is very important under such farming conditions. In order to improve productivity attempts have been made to replace local cocks with improved western breeds, such as Rhode Island or Plymouth Rock. Such initiatives, which began in French-speaking Africa over a decade ago, have not always lived up to expectations. It has not been easy to reach all poultry farmers and thus to eliminate all the local strains of cocks, especially as farmers often prefer to keep birds of different types and colours to meet particular social requirements. In fact, genetic improvement alone will not bring about a substantial increase in production. It must be combined with effective sanitation measures and improvements in feeding and health care. Closer supervision, especially during and after incubation, would also cut losses. The use of better and regularly cleaned hen roosts, the isolation or elimination of sick birds, and the quarantine of new arrivals, would also considerably reduce the incidence of disease. Some NGOs are thus promoting more appropriate roost designs that are easy to build with local materials. Regular vaccination is also necessary to fight epidemics which can destroy entire flocks almost overnight. If farmers are going to increase their poultry production significantly, they must drastically change their feeding methods. This will require educational campaigns to convince them that it is in their interest to feed their chickens. But this is only possible if their other operations provide enough surplus grain or if they can afford to buy commercial feed. This is a feasible proposition as such chickens generally sell well, either directly on local markets or to middlemen who buy on behalf of urban merchants. In fact, free-range chickens are highly valued by urban consumers who prefer them for traditional, stewed dishes. In Dakar, for example, demand often exceeds supply and free-range chickens fetch a higher price than battery chickens. But if poultry farming is to be profitable, transportation methods will have to be improved. Live hens in exposed cages stacked on the roofs of taxis, or hanging by their feet from bicycles or motorcycles, are often the worse for wear, if not dead, on arrival. Those that do survive must then face the poor handling conditions of the markets. Nevertheless, local breeds still account for the bulk of poultry production in Africa, varying from 70 % to 90 % depending on the region. Production in large, modern battery farms is now increasing rapidly in many countries, notably in Cote d'lvoire and Cameroon. This sharp growth in battery farming, supported by governments anxious to supply urban areas and to reduce meat shortages, has been stimulated by numerous financial incentives. Battery chickens differ from local breeds not only in taste, but even more so in their cultural requirements which are similar to those used in Europe. Such <b>intensive</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>farming</b> is most often located on the outskirts of large cities. In Cote d'lvoire, for example, 90 % of this type of farming is concentrated around Abidjan with practically none in rural areas. The smallest of these battery farms have only a few hundred birds, use improved breeds and buy part of their feed. They are owned by city dwellers, merchants or state employees who use them to supplement their incomes. Intensive poultry farms are hardly ever owned by small farmers, except where charitable organizations or NGOs have provided financial assistance. Since few of the operators have been specifically trained for the job, feeding and sanitation standards are often DOor. Huge battery farms also exist, housing thousands or tens of thousands of birds. These are sometimes known as 'chicken cathedrals' and have been set up by large European firms. The largest of these operate as completely integrated concerns with the same company taking care of everything from hatching to sale, including feed and medecine supply slaughtering and marketing. Others are only partially integrated feed stuff, chicks and training are provided, but the farmer is in charge of everything else, including market~ng. All of these farms use improved genetic strains. Chicks are provided from breeds which have been especially selected for egg or meat production. Other commercial criteria, often of a psychological nature, such as the colour of the eggs or feet, are also taken into consideration. Rhode Island hens, which produce coloured eggs, are highly valued in West African countries. A more important factor is the use of breeds that are adapted to both the climate and the type of feed provided. Those that come from the few major world breeders often do not have characteristics appropriate to tropical environments. Large goodlaying hens, for example, suffer from the heat. Much better are small hens, such as the 'Vedette' with its dwarfism gene, or bare neck hens, which adapt more easily to high temperatures. It is also advisable to choose birds with a sound appetite that will ensure an adequate food intake even when hot weather reduces the desire to eat. Although the use of incubators has spread recently in most countries, there are often still not enough to be able to provide battery farms with adequate supplies of day-old chicks. They thus have to be flown in from abroad which is very expensive and risky. Those chicks that do survive the stressful journey often arrive in such a state that their initial growth is severly compromized. These battery farms use feed which is prepared locally but consists of a large proportion of imported ingredients to which locally available raw materials are added wherever possible. The use of soya and maize cakes, minerals and vitamins from Europe or the United States results in a considerable drain on foreign reserves and problems of storage and supply interruptions. Imported raw materials account for nearly 50 % of the cost of a chicken. The same is true for medicines, which are rarely produced entirely in the country. On the other hand, local resources are often under-exploited and little work has been done on how to make better use of them or how to ensure a higher and more consistent quality. Many products nevertheless deserve to be more widely used: cassava, molasses, rice by-products, copra and palm cakes and, of course, cotton or ground-nut cakes Many of these products go to waste, yet they could, to a large extent, replace imported products and increase the much needed self-sufficiency in feed stocks. African battery poultry farming thus remains highly dependent on foreign supplies and technical expertise. The building designs used are often copied from European models which are obviously not always appropriate for hot countries. It would be preferable to construct buildings which are better ventilated, have better heat protection, more drinking troughs and less densely-populated hen houses. Although African battery farms are considerably more productive than poultry farming in the countryside, they do not achieve the levels of productivity of European chicken factories as the birds fatten less quickly and lay fewer and smaller eggs. Heat and the rapid spread of microbial infections in humid regions are the main reasons for this. Productivity would be improved if battery farms were located in cooler areas such as uplands. In spite of some negative results, <b>intensive</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>farming</b> has developed spectacularly over the last decade as it remains the only way of rapidly meeting demand. However, prices are still high for the consumer and the commercial market, serving essentially Europeans and wellto-do Africans, is likely to become saturated unless prices come down. Moreover frozen chicken imported directly from industrialized countries is beginning to make considerable inroads on this same rich man's market. These products, heavily subsidized by the exporting countries, are often less expensive in ACP countries than locally-produced chicken. There has also been an increase in the production and consumption of eggs but their market does not extend beyond urban areas. Although modern poultry farming is capable of providing high protein food for towns, it is still too expensive and dependent on external factors. Applied research on the food value of local raw materials and the training of competent personnel are needed if self-sufficiency is to be ensured. At some time, traditional poultry farming, relying solely on local resources, is a potential source of considerable production. But it has so far been underestimated. increased information and extension programmes, improved sanitation, and better marketing and distribution networks would enable traditional poultry farming to make a more significant contribution to both the village and the national economy Such chicken production will never be able to meet urban needs, but the towns can become a real market for small producers who could obtain considerable extra income without competing with battery farms. What then is the solution ? Should one increase production in order to develop the market? Or develop the market in order to increase production ? It really isn't a question of which comes first, the chicken or the egg, but rather of the willingness to ensure that poultry farming is given a major role in projects and aid.

40|$|Abstract: High Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) {{may pose}} {{a major threat}} for the Belgium poultry sector, as an {{outbreak}} of HPAI results in tremendous economic losses. In {{order to reduce the}} economic damage for an outbreak, different strategies to control HPAI are evaluated. In a first stage the structure of the Belgium poultry sector is described and risks are analysed. The actual risks are dependent of the <b>intensive</b> character of <b>poultry</b> <b>farming</b> in Belgium, the large number of transport movements of living poultry, the presence of sensitive nature areas and the border with the Netherlands where the poultry density is even larger. In a second stage the possible intervention strategies are evaluated. Starting from the current regulation, two strategies are worked out: stamping out and emergency vaccination. The success of emergency vaccination is associated with the correct identification of compartments at risk, prompt deployment of emergency vaccines, rapid enforcement of appropriate complementary control measures and also the level of being ready. In a third stage an economic analysis of control strategies for HPAI outbreaks is made. Results suggest that from an economic point of view, stamping-out is at farm level a better option then emergency vaccination within the current context.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{salmonella}} in poultry and salmonellosis {{in our country}} became a rather topical one with {{the latest developments in}} industrial poultry farming. Against the expectations, {{it turned out that the}} <b>intensive</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>farming</b> and the relevant intensive methods of farming and feeding do foster development and spread of pathogenic micro-organisms, especially salmonellas. Gyurov et al. (2006) outline that the dominant types of salmonella in poultry are S. enteritidis, S. gallinarum and S. typhimurium are present in 80 % of all the isolates, thus justifying the necessity of regular monitoring of such targeting. Everywhere in diagnostic units countrywide, there is well identified trend of more and more decreasing number of incoming biological samples for pathological examination and microbiological testing and it requires appropriate efforts to be overcome. This study place the focus of analyses on microbiological tests performed on diagnostic materials in laboratories of National Diagnostic & Research Veterinary Medical Institute (NDRVMI) and in others in the country, and also on the trials carried out to achieve a more comprehensive monitoring of flocks of identified salmonella infections. Furthermore, it explores the isolates of the Salmonella strains and summarises the results generated by all the National Programmes for Control of Salmonellosis in Poultry (NPCSP), which cover flocks of breeding stock, laying hens, broilers and turkeys. Subject to analyses are also the methods applied for testing for salmonella and salmonellosis in poultry-breeding and the results collected from testing for salmonella bacteria in feed. Laboratory data on poultry cover the five-year period since 2007 till 2011 and are generated by the tests performed in the laboratory named ‘Bacterial Diseases in Poultry’ with the NDRVMI, where a total of 11269 samples have been tested as taken from fallen poultry and their environment in accordance with the requirements laid down in the NPCSP. This total is broken by years, as follows: • Year 2007 : 636 samples tested for S. enteritidis in day-old and six-day broiler chickens (the 2 positive ones were taken from two flocks of no link between each other). Furthermore, under additional programme there were 3 cases (1 + 1 + 1) of three different salmonella species (S. manchester, S. chester and S. typhimurium) found in one poultry farm of broilers, and other two other isolates of Salmonella gr. C were isolated from samples of laying hens of two flocks. • Year 2008 : There were 2233 samples taken under the surveillance provided for in the Programme for detection of Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp., all being also tested (as all others subject to this report) in the above mentioned laboratory. These samples yielded 86 isolates of Salmonella spp. (ref. the NPCS in broilers for 2008); • Year 2009 : There were 1970 samples tested to yield (in March) 2 cases of Salmonellas of gr. OC in broiler chickens and a total of 10 isolates; • Year 2010 : The number of samples tested was 3124 to yield 7 isolates, these including 2 cases of S. typhimurium in fallen herons in January, 2 cases of S. gallinarium (samples taken in backyards) and 1 isolate of Salmonellas of gr. OC of egg-shell samples of broiler chickens; • Year 2011 : a total of 3306 samples tested to have isolates of Salmonellas in laying hens, all being delivered under the self-control requirements applicable to poultry farms. The yield was of only isolate of Salmonella gr. OC. Briefly, there were 11269 samples tested during the whole aforementioned period to yield isolate(s) of S. gallinarum, S. enteritidis, S. typhimurium, S. manchester, S. chester and Salmonella gr. OC. The NDRVMI Sector named ‘Bacteriology and bacterial diseases in animals, compound feed and raw materials therefor’ have testing activities in feed to detect Salmonella spp. therein. The summary here is as follows: o 2007 – 242 feed samples of two cases of salmonella isolation (one of S. munchen in compound feed for pigs and one of S. ????? in food for home pets); o 2008 - 206 feed samples tested to yield one case of isolation of Salmonella OE in compound feed for poultry; o 2009 - 204 feed samples tested and not a single Salmonella isolate; o 2010 - 148 feed samples tested and not case of S. isolate yielded; o 2011 - 296 feed samples tested to yield one case of S. isolate (S. hadar). The brief summary for the whole period is a total of 1094 feed samples tested to yield a total of 4 S. isolates. In Bulgaria, official control of Salmonella spp. in breeding flocks, laying hens, broilers (Gallus gallus) and turkey is completely encompassed within respective National Plans for Control of Salmonellas (NPCS) broken in respective industrial categories of poultry. The NPCS in breeding flocks has delivered the following laboratory results: Ø Year 2008 : A total of 85 breeding flocks subject to respective NPCS, the number of poultry therein, being 997, 101. A total of total of 1168 samples tested as faecal ones and such taken from hatcheries (egg-shells). No S+ result confirmed; Ø Year 2009 : The number of flocks under controls was 143 of 1, 205, 575 poultry and 452 tests performed under these official controls. Five (5) flocks were proven as S+ for the year, as follows: one flock of S. infantis, one of S. bareilly, two flocks of S. senftenberg and one of S. agona. This makes the percentage of the S+ flocks compared to all flocks included in the programme to be 3, 49 %; Ø Year 2010 : The official samples taken from breeding flocks were 368, all these being taken from 151 flocks in 35 farms and a total of 1, 569, 702 poultry. The total number of tests performed was 2302 (including the samples taken under the self-control plans of poultry farmers). The overall results were: 3 flocks found positive for S. infantis, 2 flocks positive for S. hadar, 1 flock positive for S. covalis, 1 flock positive for S. glostrup and 1 flock positive for S. Seftenberg. This makes 5, 3 % of positive of all the flocks tested. Ø Year 2011 : the official controls in breeding flocks involved 253 samples taken from 127 flocks (of 37 farms) encompassing 1, 319794 poultry The samples tested under the farmers’ self-control were 2247. The output was 4 positive flocks for Salmonella spp. (i. e. 3, 15 %), one flock being positive for S. typhimurium, 1 flock positive for S. agona and 2 flocks positive for S. livingstone. It should be outlined here, that the case of S. typhimurium (of sero-group OB) has given also reaction for concomitant infection of S. derby throughout the process of isolate confirmation. The 2011 percentage of positive animals is 0, 55 % – the prevalence of sero-types included in the programme. There was one flock of 7230 breeding poultry which was positive for S. typhimurium, which is rather good one, if compared with the data of previous years, in which the percentage of positive poultry (i. e. the spread/prevalence) was substantially higher. The NPCS in laying hens sector has delivered the following laboratory results: ü Year 2008 : A total of 115 farms of laying hens (yielding table eggs), involving 228 flocks of 3, 400, 784 layers. A total of 222 flocks have proven to be negative (-) for S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis, while 2 flocks (of 6100 layers) were proven as positive for S. enteritidis. ü Year 2009 : A total of 246 flocks have been involved within the NPCS in laying hens. There were 244 flocks proven negative for S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis, while 2 flocks (of 2303 layers) were proven as positive for S. enteritidis. Four other flocks were positive of other Salmonella types, i. e. one flock was positive for S. abovy, one flock for S. Corvallis, one flock for S. Agona and 1 flock for S. virchov. Percentage of flocks positive for S. enteritidis was 0, 81 % (i. e. below 1 %). ü Year 2010 : A total of 275 flocks of 3, 173, 906 poultry were subjected to sampling and testing under the official Salmonellas detection programme. Two (2) flocks have been proven to be positive for S. enteritidis and seven (7) for other Salmonella spp., as follows: 6 flocks positive for S. infantis and 1 flock positive for S. parkroyal. The official samples tested were 460 of 104 farms, while the self-controls samples were 725, all the latter being Salmonellas negative (-). All this making the year of 1 % infection by S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis in the whole sector of laying hens. ü Year 2011 : A total of 228 laying hens flocks of 2, 893, 951 poultry were subjected to sampling and testing under the official Salmonellas detection programme (the NMCSP). Four (4) flocks have been proven to be positive for S. enteritidis and 11 were proven as positive for other Salmonella spp., the latter including 2 positive for S. agona, 1 flock positive for S. hadar, 3 flocks positive for S. kottbus, 4 flocks positive for S. barely and 1 flock positive for S. infantis. This year official samples tested were 325 (of 104 farms), while the self-controls ones were 715. The 2011 data show an increase in the percentage (%) of Salmonellas positive (+) cases and higher level of prevalence of the serotypes provided for in the NCPS in this laying hens sector. Percentage (%) of positive poultry was 1, 31 % for the targeted Salmonella serotypes demonstrated by 4 flocks (of 37800 poultry) of laying hens positive for S. enteritidis. This could be compared with the same indicator (prevalence) for 2010 which was then 0, 88 %. The NPCS for Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. within the broiler sector has yielded the following laboratory results: Ø Year 2008 : The number of samples tested was 327 samples taken in 13 broiler fattening farms (Gyurov, B. I. et al. 2011 and in more details Valcheva R et al. 2011). Here, laboratory results has identified 86 salmonella strains of 16 different serovars that are, as follows: S. infantis – 14; S. enteritidis – 18; S. montevideo – 22; S. virchov – 5; S. menden – 4; S. thompson – 3; S. kottbus – 2; S. typhimurium - 1, S. give - 1; S. concord – 1; S. newport - 1; S. bonariensis – 1; S. kiss - 1; S. irumu – 1; S. parkroyal - 1 and S. Group C 1 (6, 7 : - :-) – 10. Ø Year 2009 : A total of 1069 flocks tested for Salmonella spp. under official control represented by 1471 samples tested to cover an array of over 22085874 broiler chickens. Three (3) flocks were positive for S. enteritidis, one for S. virchov, two (2) flocks were positive for S. kottbus and one (1) for S. agona. The test results give grounds to consider the objective of the programme achieved, without any technical difficulties. The percentage of positive flocks (prevalence) for the whole 2009 was 0, 37 %, which is well below 1 %. Ø Year 2010 : More than 18, 916, 348 broilers were covered by official controls by a total of 1094 official samples taken from 1088 flocks of 159 broiler farms. Only one (1) flock was proven as positive for S. typhimurium, while 14 flocks have demonstrated other serovars of Salmonella spp., but none of them all was S. enteritidis. These 14 isolates of Salmonella spp. were as follows: 10 flocks of S. infantis; 1 flock of S. newport, 2 flocks of S. tennessee and 1 flock of S. mbandaka. The tests performed on self controls covered all the 2077 samples taken by broiler farmers, but all were proven as negative for the targeted Salmonella spp. Ø Year 2011 : Official samples from broiler flocks were 513 taken from 1867 flocks in 171 farms (29, 277, 987 broilers). Within this whole year period there have not been any flocks of detected (positive) cases of S. typhimurium or S. enteritidis. Twelve (12) flocks were positive for other Salmonella serotypes. These are as follows: 3 flocks were positive for S. infantis, 4 flocks were positive for S. livingstone and 5 flocks were positive for S hadar. In the year there were also 1865 tests performed on samples taken under the self control of broiler farmers, but these have not yielded any positive (S+) for the targeted Salmonella spp. There are very few farmers keeping turkeys for fattening, this making the results of this ‘fattening turkey’ sector very brief. In 2010 there were 8 pooled samples taken and tested as negative, the same being the case of 2011, in which the number of samples tested was four (4). Usage of vaccines is not prohibited for poultry flocks. Vaccinations take place in breeding flocks (Gallus gallus) and in flocks of laying hens. Vaccines (live or inactivated) should and are all involved in the registrar of veterinary medicinal products (VMPs). Only the vaccine authorised by the only national Competent Authority, i. e. Bulgarian Food Safety Agency (BFSA) may be used in Bulgaria. Vaccination against Salmonella spp. is targeted at the three main serovars of importance in poultry farming, i. e. farmed poultry are subject to vaccination against S. gallinarum, S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium. The situation with breeding flocks covered by vaccination during recent years is as follows: 2008 – of 85 flocks (of 1, 205, 575 poultry) the vaccinated ones were 54 flocks (of 204 000 growing up parents); 2009 – of 143 flocks (of 1, 205, 575 poultry) the vaccinated ones were 104 (of 747, 750 growing up parents) plus 101 flocks (of 565 500 parents); 2010 – of 156 flocks (of 1, 569, 702 poultry) there were 116 vaccinated flocks (of 936, 884 growing up parents) plus 87 flocks (of 373, 560 parents); 2011 – of 127 flocks (of 1, 319, 794 poultry), there were 111 vaccinated flocks (of 1, 310, 136. parents) and another 77 flocks (of 480, 545 growing up parents). As for the laying hens sector the situation demonstrates progressively increasing number of vaccinated flocks between 2008 and 2011. The 2011 total gives 1088 flocks (of 130, 797, 780 layers), of which 283 were the vaccinated flocks (of 4, 275, 665). The annual developments and implementation of National Programmes for Control of Salmonella (NPCS) in poultry has proven its disciplining effect on both official controls bodies and the self-control activities applied by poultry farmers. However, a pending necessity it ensure improvement of sampling performed under the self-control plans of poultry farmers or making it incorporated within official controls plans and actions. Furthermore, there is a need to conduct well planned observations and tests on the effectivenes...|$|E

Seven studies were undertaken with the following objectives: · Assess the types of zoonotic pathogens in waste · Assess the transfer of pathogens during re-use both within the shed and externally in the environment · The potential for movement of pathogens via aerosols In the first and second studies the extent of zoonotic pathogens was evaluated in both piggery effluent and chicken litter and Salmonella and Campylobacter were detected in both wastes. In the third study the dynamics of Salmonella during litter re-use was examined and results showed a trend for lower Salmonella levels and serovar diversity in re-used litter compared to new litter. Thus, re-use within the <b>poultry</b> <b>farming</b> system posed no increased risk. The fourth study addressed the direct risks of pathogens to farm workers due to reuse of piggery effluent within the pig shed. Based on air-borne Escherichia coli (E. coli) levels, re-using effluent did not pose a risk. In the fifth study high levels of Arcobacter spp. were detected in effluent ponds and freshly irrigated soils with potential food-safety risks during the irrigation of food-crops and pasture. The sixth and seventh studies addressed the risks from aerosols from mechanically ventilated sheds. Staphylococci were shown to have potential as markers, with airborne levels gradually dropping and reaching background levels at 400 m distance. Salmonella was detected (at low levels) {{both inside and outside the}} shed (at 10 m). Campylobacter was detected only once inside the shed during the 3 -year period (at low levels).

40|$|Newcastle disease (ND), {{caused by}} Newcastle disease virus, is an acute, {{contagious}} and pathogenic infection of pet, free living and domestic birds. ND is an epidemic disease {{and it is}} responsible for high economic losses due to up to 100 % mortality. The control of ND in the <b>intensive</b> commercial <b>poultry</b> <b>farms</b> is largely dependent on prophylactic immunisation using conventional vaccines. The ND V 4 vaccine and its derivative ND V 4 -HR vaccine were selected originally for use in village chickens, due to their immunogenicity, thermostability, transmissibility and ease of administration. The efficacy of V 4 and V 4 HR vaccines have been established in many Asian and African countries {{in their ability to}} challenge a wide range of recognised and local velogenic NDV. Therefore, ND V 4 was tested for efficacy against B 1172 challenge NDV isolated in south Africa in 1993. Twenty-eight one day-old replacement pullets were vaccinated by eye-drop route at 21 and 49 days old. Chickens vaccinated by eye-drop route were left to mingle with the unvaccinated in-contact chickens. At 63 days all chickens including the unvaccinated control group were individually challenged with B 1172 NDV. Serological monitoring of NDV antibody response was done using HI and ELISA tests. The ND V 4 vaccine induced full protection against B 1172 NDV in chickens vaccinated by eye-drop vaccination and in 55 % of chickens vaccinated by the in-contact method. No association was seen between NDV antibody titer at pre-challenge and the ability to withstand B 1172 challenge NDV. A fair to good agreement was seen between the HI and ELISA test in monitoring NDV antibody response during the experiment. Although, the ELISA showed a higher sensitivity and specificity than the HI test, further studies are required using this method of comparison.

However, despite {{a huge amount of}} published material and many available techniques, doubts over the success of national and European initiatives remain. Uptake of the more cost-effective and environmentally-friendly farming methods (such as dietary control, building design and good manure management) is already widespread but unlikely to be enough in itself to ensure that current environmental targets are fully met. Some of the abatement options available for <b>intensive</b> pig and <b>poultry</b> <b>farming</b> are brought together under the European IPPC/IED directive where they are listed as Best Available Techniques (BAT). This list is far from complete and other methods including many treatment options are currently excluded. However, the efficacies of many of the current BAT-listed options are modest, difficult to regulate and in some cases they may even be counterproductive with respect to other objectives ie pollution swapping. Evaluation of the existing and new BAT technologies is a key to a successful abatement of pollution from the sector and this in turn relies heavily on good measurement strategies.

40|$|In 1950 poultry {{was a rare}} luxury in Britain, {{only one}} per cent of the total meat {{consumption}}. But over the next thirty years chicken consumption grew at the remarkable (compound) rate of 10 per cent per annum, while the overall consumption of meat remained stagnant from the 1950 s to the 1980 s. By then poultry had become {{the single most important}} source of meat, with a quarter of the total share of the market, replacing former favourites like beef, mutton and bacon in the British diet. This transformation was made possible by the emergence of <b>intensive</b> rearing in <b>poultry</b> <b>farming.</b> This was a dramatic change in production, dependent on technological innovations across several otherwise unrelated sectors: in pharmaceuticals and feedstuffs production, in refrigeration, slaughtering and packaging. The widespread distribution of cheap chicken led to its mass adoption throughout the country. But such a transformation in meat eating habits was not without its controversies. Contemporary concerns emerged from the late 1950 s over the possible long term dangers to human health from the technological transformation inherent in intensive rearing regimes. The paper emphasises that it was the leading retailers, in particular J. Sainsbury, who acted as a key intermediary in this contested market, reconciling consumer uncertainty by attaching their own reputation to product quality, and then furthermore by intervening in the quality standards employed in its supply chain. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Air {{pollution}} {{has been}} shown to increase the susceptibility to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Previously, we observed an increased incidence of CAP in adults living within 1 km from <b>poultry</b> <b>farms,</b> potentially related to particulate matter and endotoxin emissions. We aim to confirm the increased risk of CAP near <b>poultry</b> <b>farms</b> by refined spatial analyses, and we hypothesize that the oropharyngeal microbiota composition in CAP patients may be associated with residential proximity to <b>poultry</b> <b>farms.</b> Methods: A spatial kernel model was used to analyze the association between proximity to <b>poultry</b> <b>farms</b> and CAP diagnosis, obtained from electronic medical records of 92, 548 GP patients. The oropharyngeal microbiota composition was determined in 126 hospitalized CAP patients using 16 S-rRNA-based sequencing, and analyzed in relation to residential proximity to <b>poultry</b> <b>farms.</b> Results: Kernel analysis confirmed a significantly increased risk of CAP when living near <b>poultry</b> <b>farms,</b> suggesting an excess risk up to 1. 15 km, followed by a sharp decline. Overall, the oropharyngeal microbiota composition differed borderline significantly between patients living < 1 km and ≥ 1 km from <b>poultry</b> <b>farms</b> (PERMANOVA p = 0. 075). Results suggested a higher abundance of Streptococcus pneumoniae (mean relative abundance 34. 9 % vs. 22. 5 %, p = 0. 058) in patients living near <b>poultry</b> <b>farms,</b> which was verified by unsupervised clustering analysis, showing overrepresentation of a S. pneumoniae cluster near <b>poultry</b> <b>farms</b> (p = 0. 049).
