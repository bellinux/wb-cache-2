5|$|Adderall is {{generally}} well-tolerated and effective in treating {{the symptoms of}} ADHD and narcolepsy. At therapeutic <b>doses,</b> Adderall causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. At these <b>doses,</b> it induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. In contrast, much larger <b>doses</b> of Adderall can impair cognitive control, cause rapid muscle breakdown, or induce a psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia). The side effects of Adderall vary widely among individuals, but most commonly include insomnia, dry mouth, and loss of appetite. The risk of developing an addiction is insignificant when Adderall is used as prescribed at fairly low daily <b>doses,</b> such as those used for treating ADHD; however, the routine use of Adderall in larger daily <b>doses</b> poses a significant risk of addiction due to the pronounced reinforcing effects that are present at higher <b>doses.</b> Recreational <b>doses</b> of Adderall are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic <b>doses,</b> and carry a far greater risk of serious adverse effects.|$|E

40|$|SummaryAimThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the influence of high <b>dose</b> rate (HDR) brach-ytherapy source step size, source dwell position, <b>dose</b> prescription depth, <b>dose</b> specification points and optimization technique on <b>dose</b> distribution around Microselectron HDR brachytherapy vaginal cylinders and to evaluate the influence of distal dwell position and optimization technique on rectal and bladder <b>dose</b> of patients treated for vaginal cuff irradiation. Materials/MethodsOrthogonal radiographs of vaginal cylinders of diameter 2. 0, 2. 5, 3. 0 and 3. 5 cm form the basis of the study. <b>Dose</b> distribution using the PLATO brachytherapy treatment planning system (version 14. 1) was generated. Two different HDR cylinder models, namely the non-curved dome model (NCDM) and curved dome model (CDM), were studied. To evaluate bladder and rectum <b>dose</b> in the patients NCDM was used. ResultsCDM gives more uniform <b>dose</b> distribution around the cylinder than NCDM. <b>Dose</b> prescription at 5 mm depth from the surface results in very high <b>dose</b> to apex and dome as compared with the surface <b>dose</b> prescription. <b>Dose</b> prescription depth and dwell positions influence the length of prescription isodose. Optimization method and dwell positions affect the bladder and rectal <b>dose</b> of the studied patients. ConclusionsUniform <b>dose</b> distribution can be obtained for HDR vaginal cylinders by appropriately selecting <b>dose</b> specification points and optimization method. <b>Dose</b> distribution can be configured to provide a uniform <b>dose</b> on the surface, if the apex and curved surface of the cylinder are considered for <b>dose</b> specification and optimization. Appropriate HDR parameters are identified to minimize the <b>dose</b> to the apex of the vaginal cylinder, essential to reduce the <b>dose</b> to overlying small bowel and reduce the <b>dose</b> to rectum and bladder...|$|R
30|$|Radiation {{protection}} {{is an important}} pillar of the safety culture in radiology. Besides optimisation, justification, clinical audits and education, diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) are valuable tools. The ESR wishes to promote establishment of <b>dose</b> repositories to support <b>dose</b> management and clinical audit to document improvement. Technology holds the key to developments in patient and staff radiation safety [7], and thus developing and utilising <b>dose</b> management tools has the greatest potential.

40|$|Background: <b>Dose</b> banding is a {{recently}} suggested <b>dosing</b> method that uses predefined ranges (bands) of {{body surface area}} (BSA) to calculate each patients <b>dose</b> by using a single BSA-value per band. Thus, drugs with sufficient long-term stability can be prepared in advance. The main advantages of <b>dose</b> banding are to reduce patient waiting time and improve pharmacy capacity planning; additional benefits include reduced medication errors, reduced drug wastage, and prospective quality control. This study compares <b>dose</b> banding with individual BSA <b>dosing</b> and fixed <b>dose</b> according to pharmacokinetic criteria. Methods:Three BSA bands were defined: BSA 1. 7 m 2, 1. 7 m 2 BSA 1. 9 m 2, BSA 1. 9 m 2 and each patient <b>dose</b> was calculated based on a unique BSA-value per band (1. 55, 1. 80, and 2. 05 m 2, respectively). By using individual clearance values of six drugs (cisplatin, docetaxel, paclitaxel, doxorubicin, irinotecan, and topotecan) from 1012 adult cancer patients in total, the AUCs corresponding to three <b>dosing</b> methods (BSA <b>dosing,</b> <b>dose</b> banding, and fixed <b>dose)</b> were compared with a target AUC for each drug. Results:For all six drugs, the per cent variation in individual <b>dose</b> obtained with <b>dose</b> banding compared with BSA <b>dosing</b> ranged between 14 % and 22 %, and distribution of AUC values was very similar with both <b>dosing</b> methods. In terms of reaching the target AUC, {{there was no significant}} difference in precision between <b>dose</b> banding and BSA <b>dosing,</b> except for paclitaxel (32. 0 % vs 30. 7 %, respectively; P= 0. 05). However, precision was significantly better for BSA <b>dosing</b> compared with fixed <b>dose</b> for four out of six drugs. Conclusion:For the studied drugs, implementation of <b>dose</b> banding should be considered as it entails no significant increase in interindividual plasma exposure...|$|R
5|$|Colchicine is an {{alternative}} for those unable to tolerate NSAIDs. At high <b>doses,</b> side effects (primarily gastrointestinal upset) limit its usage.

5|$|In United States practice, {{intravenous}} (IV) {{and oral}} administration {{are considered to}} be equally effective and safe if given within 8hours of ingestion. However, IV is the only recommended route in Australasian and British practice. Oral acetylcysteine is given as a 140mg/kg loading dose followed by 70mg/kg every four hours for 17 more <b>doses,</b> and if the patient vomits within 1 hour of dose, the dose must be repeated. Oral acetylcysteine may be poorly tolerated due to its unpleasant taste, odor, and its tendency to cause nausea and vomiting. If repeated <b>doses</b> of charcoal are indicated because of another ingested drug, then subsequent <b>doses</b> of charcoal and acetylcysteine should be staggered.|$|E
5|$|In {{modern times}} {{dosimetry}} is done very differently. Equivalent <b>doses</b> {{would not be}} reported in roentgen; they would be calculated with different weighting factors, {{and they are not}} considered as relevant to acute radiation syndrome as absorbed <b>doses.</b> Recent documents have made various interpretations of Slotin's dose, ranging from 287rad to 21sievert. Based on citations and supporting reasoning, the most reliable estimate may be a 1978 Los Alamos memo which suggested 10Gy(n) + 1.14 Gy(γ) for Slotin and 2 Gy(n) + 1.1 Gy(γ) for Daghlian. These <b>doses</b> are consistent with the symptoms they experienced.|$|E
30|$|In RNT, <b>dose</b> rate is {{inversely}} proportional to the radionuclide half-life for a given total <b>dose.</b> Therefore, a longer half-life radionuclide such as 90 Y delivers <b>dose</b> at a relatively lower rate for a fixed total <b>dose.</b> Equation 11 implies that for a similar absorbed <b>dose,</b> radionuclides with a shorter half-life could potentially result in better <b>dose</b> response for RNT. Since radionuclides with shorter half-lives deliver <b>dose</b> at much higher initial rate, the DNA damage process can compete with DNA repair rate and thus result in better <b>dose</b> response.|$|R

5|$|Its effects, {{depending}} on dosage, include {{an increase in}} sodium excretion by the kidneys, an increase in urine output, an increase in heart rate, {{and an increase in}} blood pressure. At low <b>doses</b> it acts through the sympathetic nervous system to increase heart muscle contraction force and heart rate, thereby increasing cardiac output and blood pressure. Higher <b>doses</b> also cause vasoconstriction that further increases blood pressure. Older literature also describes very low <b>doses</b> thought to improve kidney function without other consequences, but recent reviews have concluded that <b>doses</b> at such low levels are not effective and may sometimes be harmful. While some effects result from stimulation of dopamine receptors, the prominent cardiovascular effects result from dopamine acting at α1, β1, and β2 adrenergic receptors.|$|E

40|$|The {{degradation}} of the LM 193 dual voltage comparator has been studied at different TID <b>dose</b> rate profiles, including several different constant <b>dose</b> rates and a variable <b>dose</b> rate that simulates {{the behavior of a}} solar flare. A comparison of results following constant <b>dose</b> rate vs. variable <b>dose</b> rates is made to explore how well the constant <b>dose</b> rates used for typical part testing predict the performance during a simulated space-like mission. Testing at a constant <b>dose</b> rate equal to the lowest <b>dose</b> rate seen during the simulated flare provides an extremely conservative estimate of the overall amount of degradation. A constant <b>dose</b> rate equal to the average <b>dose</b> rate is also more conservative than the variable rate. It appears that, for this part, weighting the <b>dose</b> rates by the amount of total <b>dose</b> received at each rate (rather than the amount of time at each <b>dose</b> rate) results in an average rate that produces an amount of degradation that is a reasonable approximation to that received by the variable rate...|$|R

5|$|The {{toxic dose}} of {{paracetamol}} is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4grams. Higher <b>doses</b> lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single <b>doses</b> above 10grams or 200mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, {{have a reasonable}} likelihood of causing toxicity. Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller <b>doses</b> within 24hours exceed these levels. Following a normal dose of 1gram of paracetamol {{four times a day}} for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in alanine transaminase in their liver to typically about three times the normal value. It is unlikely that this dose would lead to liver failure. Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal <b>doses</b> over 3 to 4 days. In adults, a dose of 6grams a day over the preceding 48hours could potentially lead to toxicity, while in children acute <b>doses</b> above 200mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity. Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal <b>doses</b> being the major cause of toxicity in children.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe primary {{objective}} of a Phase I cancer clinical trial {{is to determine}} the maximum tolerated <b>dose</b> of a drug.
