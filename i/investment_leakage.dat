40|$|Investment in {{productive}} sector is the precondition for achieving {{the economic growth}} from a country perspective. Capital formation positively supports this investment function. Once a satisfactory level of capital is formed, the option of sound investment comes that ultimately leads to flow additional capital in future. The financial institutions, mainly banks, do these functions. In countries like ours, <b>investment</b> <b>leakage</b> {{in the form of}} non-functionalities poses a great threat on the sound running of this ‘capital formation – investment – capital formation’ process. This paper deals with non performing loan situations, basically the causes and consequences of this economic devil that is very much embedded in current economic structure. The possible steps are also pointed out to handle such situation. ...|$|E
40|$|Focusing on the {{industrial}} sector of the EU ETS, this study identifies and analyses the entries and the exits of installations into and from the system over the period 2005 - 2013. The overall number of exits was notable relative {{to the number of}} installations, and significantly greater than that of the entries. Further, we estimate a hazard model for the risk of an installation exiting the EU ETS, which identifies a number of different factors referring to the installation, the firm, and the economy, explaining the occurrence of this event. In addition to these, an “end-of-phase effect” is found, whereby the chances of exit were significantly higher in the final years of the EU ETS Phases I and II. This effect, related to the rules concerning the closure of an installation and the withdrawal of the relative allowances, is detrimental to the allocative efficiency of the system and, therefore, to its cost-effectiveness in emissions abatement. The evidence provided by the study and some of its methodological aspects may be useful for future attempts to identify <b>investment</b> <b>leakage</b> in the EU ETS...|$|E
40|$|As {{the world}} largest carbon dioxide (CO 2) emitter, China is under {{pressure}} to develop policies to mitigate carbon emissions, with market-based approaches under consideration. Emissions trading is theoretically the most efficient approach but some countries are starting with carbon/energy taxes. This research examines these two options through literature and practice in order to evaluate which might be most suitable for China and then to estimate the major economic impacts of the selected option. The thesis first looks at the limited cases of emissions trading, with a particular focus, using official reports and data and interviews, on the example of SO 2 control in Taiyuan city. It is found that the Taiyuan SO 2 emissions trading program {{does not seem to}} be functioning anything like the ideal emissions trading model and cannot be judged as a successful scheme in terms of emissions reductions, cost savings, innovation and investment in clean energy, and <b>investment</b> <b>leakage.</b> When combined with concerns about the limited development of truly free markets and the weak law basis in China, it is concluded that emissions trading may not be the best policy option at this stage and that a carbon tax might be the most practical interim measure. Next, the impacts of a carbon tax are considered through a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model for China. The simulation results show that overall the introduction of a carbon tax will have a negative impact on the economy, but this negative impact is relatively gentle if considered against the emissions reductions. After a carbon tax is imposed, carbon intensive sectors will suffer most seriously and there will be a shift away from high-carbon factors toward low-carbon or non-carbon factors. Moreover, the adverse effects of the tax on economy could be relieved to some extent by subsidizing households, through transfers of the tax revenue. From the experience of Australia, China could also use carbon tax as a transitional policy and then move to carbon emissions trading system when the market mechanism becomes mature. ...|$|E

50|$|When applications, {{such as a}} 3D game engine or a 3D {{computer}} graphics software, shunt calculations from the CPU to the GPU, they usually use a special purpose API, like OpenGL or Direct3D, and do not address the hardware directly (see also Cell (microprocessor)). Because all translation from API calls to actual GPU opcodes {{is done by the}} device driver, it will contain a considerable amount of specialized knowledge and be the constant object of optimization. This takes time and involves significant financial <b>investment.</b> Thus <b>leakage</b> of device driver source code, whether published under a free license or not, can give competitors an advantage — especially newcomers to the business of graphic acceleration, who would gain a considerable amount of know-how without bearing the costs of developing that knowledge.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe optimal {{economic}} {{level in}} leakage reduction must be defined when reaching equilibrium between marginal costs of saved water and marginal costs of achieving additional reduction in leakage (Farley and Trow, 2003). This concept {{is used to}} deal with the question of what the target in reducing leakage should be and how related costs can be justified. Nevertheless, when negotiating for optimal decisions considering complex multi-centre (or multi-district) supply systems, subject to reduced water resources and reduced funds, the problem could be much more difficult to define and analyze. Mainly, in this situation, the optimal economic problem can be modified in finding the priorities in <b>investment</b> for <b>leakage</b> reductions between the centres in the supply network. This paper is related to these aspects; it mainly focuses on finding a reliable and correctly justified cost- function attribution for the water in multi-source and multi-centre systems...|$|R
40|$|Carbon leakage {{is central}} to the {{discussion}} on climate policy, given the confluence of issues that are currently being debated, including the 2030 Energy and Climate Framework and the review of the EU carbon leakage list by 2014. Carbon leakage is the result of asymmetrical carbon policies, especially carbon pricing, and the resulting carbon cost, which affects the international competitive position of some EU industry and could displace production and/or investment, and the emissions of the activities displaced. This paper identifies the difference between carbon price and carbon cost to leakage exposed industry as one of two fundamental issues to be understood and addressed; lack of visibility on future climate policies and anti-leakage provisions is the other key issue. While this is a global issue, most of the experience has been accumulated in the EU. Carbon leakage {{is only one of the}} factors that could affect the competitive position of sectors, but it is difficult to attribute the impact of carbon costs versus other variables such as energy costs, labour, etc. Studies have predicted the risk of a significant amount of production leakage in a number of energy-intensive industries. To address the danger, they were included in the EU ETS carbon leakage list, which gave them access to free allowances. However, a limited number of studies undertaken after the end of the second trading period (2012) show little evidence of production leakage and asks the question whether the issue has not been blown out of proportion. The paper argues that the past may not be a good representation of the future, as it was heavily influenced by a high level of free allocation, the exceptional economic downturn, CO 2 prices significantly below what was anticipated, as well as the potential for changes in some fundamental variables such as the shrinking pool of allowances available for free allocation. It emphasises the need for a well-informed debate in the EU on measures to address carbon leakage post- 2020, underpinned by a number of options, and objective criteria to evaluate those options. It emphasises that the debate should cover both <b>investment</b> and production <b>leakage,</b> caused by both direct and indirect carbon costs...|$|R
