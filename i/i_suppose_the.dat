25|$|Yes, <b>I</b> <b>suppose.</b> <b>The</b> {{violence}} {{served a}} therapeutic purpose. It's unsettling {{to think that}} at any moment life can flare up into senseless violence. But it can and does, and {{people need to be}} ready for it. What you make for others is first of all what you make for yourself. If I’m persuaded that our life is predicated upon violence, that the entire structure of what we call civilization, the scaffolding that we’ve built up over the millennia, can collapse at any moment, then whatever I write is going to be affected by that assumption. The process of life presupposes violence, in the plant world the same as the animal world. But among the animals only man can conceptualize violence. Only man can enjoy the idea of destruction.|$|E
500|$|Kirchherr is {{credited}} with inventing the Beatles' moptop haircut although she disagrees, saying: [...] "All that rubbish people said, that I created their hairstyle, that's rubbish! Lots of German boys had that hairstyle. Stuart [...] had {{it for a long}} while and the others copied it. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>the</b> most important thing I contributed to them was friendship." [...] In 1995, Kirchherr told BBC Radio Merseyside: [...] "All my friends in art school used to run around with this sort of what you call Beatles haircut. And my boyfriend then, Klaus Voormann, had this hairstyle, and Stuart liked it very very much. He was the first one who really got the nerve to get the Brylcreem out of his hair and asking me to cut his hair for him. Pete [...] has really curly hair and it wouldn't work." [...] Kirchherr says that after she cut Sutcliffe's hair, Harrison asked her to do the same when she was visiting Liverpool, and Lennon and McCartney had their hair cut in the same style while they were in Paris, by Kirchherr's friend, Vollmer, who was living there at the time as an assistant to photographer William Klein.|$|E

500|$|Michell {{attempted}} {{to be as}} faithful to the novel as possible, in particular avoiding what he felt was the polished, artificial feel of other period dramas set in the 19th-century. The director explained, [...] "I was desperately {{trying to make it}} feel like it could be happening in the next room. I tried to make it something which is absolutely about real people and not about dressing or hairstyles or carpet". Consequently, because he felt the realistic look of the age would make the film more dramatic, Michell chose to depict the actors without make-up, and disallowed them from looking too hygienic. Root commented about the film's natural look in an interview, [...] "I basically didn't wear any makeup , and my hair was obviously set in a very unflattering way... <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>the</b> lighting was quite harsh, as well. None of us looked good". She said in a separate interview, [...] "I wanted to make Anne Elliot a somewhat plain woman who was not really miserable but had found a way to be content somehow, and yet emotions are buzzing around her all the time". Root believed the film's realistic depiction of the age was a key aspect of its appeal.|$|E
500|$|American {{musician}} Shawn Colvin guest {{starred in}} the episode as Rachel Jordan, a character that she would later return to voice in the episode [...] "I'm Goin' to Praiseland" [...] (2001) from season twelve. In that episode, she stays at the Flanders' house with Ned, and leaves briefly after he attempted to mold her {{in the image of}} his deceased wife. At the end of the episode, however, she returns and has a date with him. Colvin told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer that being raised in Carbondale, Illinois meant she did not have to do much research for the guest appearance: [...] "It's just very isolated [...] There was church music and that was about it. [...] I didn't have to dig too deep for the role. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>the</b> whole 'Simpsons' thing is kind of like a hick town." [...] Colvin has shown a segment of her guest role on The Simpsons during some of her concerts, including one at Cape Cod Melody Tent in 2007. She has also performed the song that she sings in [...] "Alone Again, Natura-Diddily" [...] in concert. The Wisconsin State Journal reported that during her 2001 concert at Barrymore Theatre, the [...] "loudest audience response came after she sang a ditty that she performed as a character on The Simpsons." [...] The song, called [...] "He's the Man", later appeared on the 2007 soundtrack album [...]|$|E
500|$|The Beatles flew to India in February 1968, {{to visit}} the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram (after first meeting him on 24 August 1967, at the London Hilton hotel). Evans arrived in India {{a few days earlier}} to inspect the ashram, but as soon as Starr got off the plane, he demanded that Evans find a doctor, as his {{inoculation}} shots were causing him pain. Evans: “When we arrived at the local hospital, I tried to get immediate treatment for him , to be told curtly by the Indian doctor, 'He is not a special case and will have to wait his turn.' So off we go to pay a private doctor ten rupees for the privilege of hearing him say 'It will be all right'." [...] Evans wrote in his diary on 17 February 1968: [...] "The press really tried kicking down the gates into the Ashram, the Indian people on the Ashram called me half way through, but as soon as an Indian reporter told me [...] "No bloody foreigner is going to stop me in my own country", I cooled it." [...] Evans' diary says that he enjoyed his time in India: [...] "It's hard to believe that a week has already passed. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>the</b> peace of mind and the serenity one achieves through meditation makes the time fly," [...] and that he also enjoyed the food, unlike Starr, who had brought a suitcase full of baked beans with him. After leaving India, Harrison and Evans flew to New York, visiting Bob Dylan and The Band, who were rehearsing at their Big Pink house/studio, in Woodstock.|$|E

2500|$|The Russian intelligentsiya {{also was}} a mixture of messianism and {{intellectual}} élitism, whom the philosopher Isaiah Berlin described as: “The phenomenon, itself, with its historical and literally revolutionary consequences, is, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> <b>the</b> largest, single Russian contribution to social change in the world. The concept of intelligentsia must not be confused with the notion of intellectuals. Its members thought of themselves as united, by something more than mere interest in ideas; they conceived themselves as being a dedicated order, almost a secular priesthood, devoted to the spreading of a specific attitude to life.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Frankel {{received}} many accolades following his victory. His trainer Sir Henry Cecil said: [...] "I think it's a facetious thing to say, but he's the best I've ever seen. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>the</b> only ones I could compare would be Shergar and Blushing Groom at his best.

[...] During the interview Cecil also said that he had expected the colt to win easily, despite having ample respect for his horse's rival Canford Cliffs.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a letter}} to his mother from prison, Rudolph has written, [...] "Many good people {{continue}} to send me money and books. Most of them have, of course, an agenda; mostly born-again Christians looking to save my soul. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>the</b> assumption is made that because I'm in here I must be a 'sinner' in need of salvation, and they would be glad to sell me a ticket to heaven, hawking this salvation like peanuts at a ballgame. I do appreciate their charity, but I could really do without the condescension. They have been so nice I would hate to break it to them that I really prefer Nietzsche to the Bible." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{his time}} in Oxford, John Wesley often {{attended}} the university sermon, and later, as a fellow of Lincoln College preached sermons in the church, including the university sermon on [...] "Salvation by Faith" [...] on 18 June 1738 [...] and the [...] "Almost Christian" [...] sermon [...] on 25 July 1741. Following his denunciation of the spiritual apathy and sloth of the {{senior members of the}} University in his sermon [...] "Scriptural Christianity" [...] on 24 August 1744, he was never asked to preach there again — [...] "I preached, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> <b>the</b> last time at St Mary's," [...] he wrote in his journal, [...] "Be it so; I have fully delivered my soul." ...|$|E

2500|$|Marjorie Barnard's writing career spanned four decades, {{from the}} 1920s to the 1960s, with the {{majority}} of her works being written in the 1930s-1940s, a period in Australia noted for its flowering of women writers. Despite this, in an interview in 1986, she stated that {{there was no such thing}} as a [...] "woman writer", that [...] "there are writers good and bad. Only the work counts". In the same interview, she also said, [...] "I never achieved what I set out to do; I never achieved the goals I set myself for each book. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>the</b> only exception to that would be The Persimmon Tree". She wrote little in the last twenty years of her life.|$|E
2500|$|Many of Takahashi's {{works have}} been {{translated}} into English, {{as well as other}} European languages. Takahashi said that she did not know why her works are relatively popular with English speakers. Takahashi said [...] "Sure, there are cultural differences in my work. When I see an American comedy, even though the jokes are translated, there's always a moment when I feel puzzled and think, 'Ah, Americans would probably laugh at this more'. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>the</b> same thing must happen with my books. It's inevitable. And yet, that doesn't mean my books can't be enjoyed by English-speaking readers.

"Now Judas {{celebrated the}} festival of the {{restoration}} of the sacrifices of the temple for eight days, and omitted no sort of pleasures thereon; but he feasted them upon very rich and splendid sacrifices; and he honored God, and delighted them by hymns and psalms. Nay, they were so very glad at the revival of their customs, when, after a long time of intermission, they unexpectedly had regained the freedom of their worship, that they made it a law for their posterity, that they should keep a festival, on account of {{the restoration of}} their temple worship, for eight days. And from that time to this we celebrate this festival, and call it Lights. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>the</b> reason was because this liberty beyond our hopes appeared to us; and that thence was the name given to that festival. Judas also rebuilt the walls round about the city, and reared towers of great height against the incursions of enemies, and set guards therein. He also fortified the city Bethsura, that it might serve as a citadel against any distresses that might come from our enemies." ...|$|E
