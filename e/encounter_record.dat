50|$|Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (commonly {{referred}} to as AHLTA) is the clinical documentation engine for the Physicians to write their notes, put in orders, document procedures performed and provide the basis of medical coding information. This information is then sent into CHCS and its subsystems (ADM - ambulatory data module) provide the official repository of the medical coding information and handle the transmission of those encounters via the Comprehensive Ambulatory Patient <b>Encounter</b> <b>Record</b> (CAPER) interface. The clinical data is brought into the M2 DataMart for use in research, operational metrics, trend analysis, and many other business intelligence processes/products. AHLTA information is also contained in a Central Data Repository (CDR). This CDR contains information from AHLTA, CHCS, and AHLTA-Theater.

40|$|We {{describe}} a prototype system {{to capture and}} interpret data in a perioperative environment in order to construct an Electronic Medical <b>Encounter</b> <b>Record</b> (EMR). The EMR records and correlates significant medical data and video streams with an inferred higher-level event model of the surgery. Information from Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags provides basic context information including the presence of medical staff, devices, instruments and medication {{in the operating room}} (OR). Patient monitoring systems and sensors such as pulse oximeters and anesthesia machines provide continuous streams of physiological data. These low level data streams are processed by the TelegraphCQ adaptive dataflow system to generate higher-level primitive events, such as a nurse entering the OR. A hierarchical knowledge-based event detection system correlates primitive events, patient data and workflow data to infer high-level events, such as the onset of anesthesia.

40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} {{morbidity}} patterns {{in public and}} private primary care clinics; determine patients' reasons for encounter (RFE) and diagnoses using the ICPC- 2, and compare ten commonest diagnoses and RFEs. Methods: A cross-sectional study on randomly selected clinics was conducted nationwide. Doctors completed the Patient <b>Encounter</b> <b>Record</b> (PER) for systematically selected encounters for a week. Results: Response rate was 82. 0 (public clinic) and 33 (private clinic) with 4262 encounters and 7280 RFE. Overall, the three commonest disease categories encountered were respiratory (37. 2), general and unspecified (29. 5), and cardiovascular diseases (22. 2). Public and private clinics handled 27 versus 50 acute cases and 20. 0 versus 3. 1 chronic cases i. e. 33. 7 and 5. 6 chronic diseases/ 100 RFE respectively. Conclusion: Doctors in public clinics saw more chronic and complex diseases as well as pregnancy related complaints and follow-up cases while in private clinics more acute and minor illnesses were seen. Health services should be integrated and support given to co-manage chronic diseases in both sectors. Â© Academy of Family Physicians of Malaysia...|$|E

The EMR records and correlates significant medical data and video streams with an inferred higher-level event model of the surgery.

40|$|Abstract- The {{importance}} of sharing {{and integration of}} patient health records that are dispersed and distributed on many healthcare organizations has pushed many countries to work hard towards achieving this objective. In this paper, a model of integration has been proposed, to share at least a brief summary of important information about the patient health record from many healthcare providers. The challenges of this integration are numerous, although the focus in this paper is on three; integration issues, security, and uniqueness of the patient identifier. In this regard, a centralized summary healthcare record has been proposed. That summary will contain an integrated summary of the patient health record collected from all <b>encounters</b> <b>records</b> at different hospitals and clinics...|$|R
