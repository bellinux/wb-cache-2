50|$|Keyword {{density is}} the {{percentage}} of times a keyword or phrase appears on a web page compared to {{the total number of}} words on the page.

50|$|By extension, {{another form}} of keyword {{stuffing}} involves placing trademarks within the anchor text of third party websites, then pointing the website address within the linked text back to an infringing website. An anchor link signals to Internet users that the link points to a website address relating to the trademark. Additionally, search engines are widely known to use anchor text linking data within their search engine ranking algorithms. Thus, trademark-stuffed anchor links signal relationship information to the search engines, thereby increasing the chance that an infringing website could achieve higher organic search rankings for a trademark <b>keyword</b> <b>phrase.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{variety of}} methods can {{increase}} the prominence of a webpage within the search results. Cross linking between pages of the same website to provide more links to important pages may improve its visibility.Writing content that includes frequently searched <b>keyword</b> <b>phrase,</b> {{so as to be}} relevant {{to a wide variety of}} search queries will tend to increase traffic. Updating content so as to keep search engines crawling back frequently can give additional weight to a site. Adding relevant keywords to a web page's meta data, including the title tag and meta description, will tend to improve the relevancy of a site's search listings, thus increasing traffic. URL normalization of web pages accessible via multiple urls, using the canonical link element or via 301 redirects can help make sure links to different versions of the url all count towards the page's link popularity score.|$|E

With this expressiveness came increasingly complex constructions. Having these facts in mind, we present an efficient and generic searchable symmetric encryption construction for phrase queries.

To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} encrypted phrase search system that achieves CQA 2 security. Moreover, we demonstrate that our document collection preprocessing algorithm allows us to extend a dynamic SSE construction so that it supports phrase queries.

We examine a log file with data comprised of nearly 7, 000, 000 records spanning 33 consecutive months of a search engine marketing campaign from a major US retailer. We classify key phrases selected for the campaign with a probability of being targeted for a specific gender and then compare the consumer actions using the critical sponsored search metrics of impressions, clicks, cost-per-click, sales revenue, orders, and items sold. Findings from our analysis show that the gender-orientation of the key phrase is a significant determinant in predicting behaviors and performance, with statistically different consumer behaviors for all attributes as {{the probability of a}} male or female <b>keyword</b> <b>phrase</b> changes. However, gender neutral phrases perform the best overall, calling into question the benefits of demographic targeting.

40|$|INTERSPEECH 2006 : the 9 th International Conference on Spoken Language Processing (ICSLP), September 17 - 21, 2006, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. We {{propose a}} speaker {{verification}} method using non-audible murmur (NAM) segments, which {{are different from}} normal speech and hard for other people to catch them. To use NAM, we therefore take a text-dependent verification strategy in which each user utters her/his own <b>keyword</b> <b>phrase</b> and utilize not only speaker-specific but also keyword-specific acoustic information. We expect this strategy to yield a relatively high performance. NAM segments, which consist of multiple short-term feature vectors, are used as input vectors to capture keyword-specific acoustic information well. To handle segments {{with a large number}} of dimensions, we use the support vector machine (SVM). In experiments using NAM data of 19 male and 10 female speakers recorded in three different sessions, we achieved equal error rates of 0. 04 % (male) and 1. 1 % (female) when using 145 -ms-long NAM segments. These rates are half or less those obtained with 25 -ms-long input vectors...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This {{investigation}} {{sought to}} identify the common manifestations of KBG syndrome in the literature and to determine the major oral abnormalities in a 12 -year-old Chinese boy. Methods: PUBMED search, using the <b>keyword</b> <b>phrase</b> "KBG syndrome," produced 20 articles. Due to the disparities {{in the quality of}} evaluations in the reports, any physical feature that was not discussed was assumed to be absent. Results: Of the 54 cases, including the present case, 36 (67 %) were males. Mental retardation or global developmental delay was reported in 42 (78 %) cases, while 46 (85 %) exhibited shortness of stature. Oral features occurred in 53 (98 %) cases; macrodontia was present in 49 (96 %) cases; the present case was the only one with hyperdontia and a talon cusp. Other features were craniofacial anomalies, followed by abnormalities of the nose, hand, mouth, eyes, eyebrows, philtrum, costovertebrae, ears, and, less frequently, low hairline and lower extremity abnormalities. Conclusions: Cardinal features of KBG syndrome include facial dysmorphism, short stature, skeletal anomalies, and mild developmental delay; intraorally, macrodontia of the maxillary central incisors occurs in most cases. This is the first known report of KBG syndrome in a Chinese subject and the only case with hyperdontia and a talon cusp. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{systematic}} literature review paper which aims to present an overview {{over the last years}} research in the EU, Norway and Switzerland that deals with workplace parking. This has been done with a systematic search through the scientific search engines Scopus and Google Scholar. The <b>keyword</b> <b>phrase</b> used was “workplace AND parking”. Ten peer reviewed articles were found using predetermined criterias and two articles were qualified from reference lists. The theoretical framework used has been about sustainable development, sustainable mobility and five categories of management control measures. The results show that regulation of workplace parking supply and fees are the most discussed methods. Within these two, supply management is most effective by itself but combining the two might be even more effective. When using parking fees, what matters a lot is how often you have to pay. Paying every day or by the hour is a lot more effective in reducing car use than if monthly payment is used. The category of instruments that was discussed the most was “taxes and fees” while only one article was about “technical solutions”. An important conclusion is that combining different interventions is preferable to reach sustainable mobility. The last years research comes from a very concentrated part of Europe and is made mostly using quantitative method which is why focus now should lie on diversifying research to reach more accurate conclusions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesCongenital {{heart disease}} in {{pregnancy}} is {{a leading cause of}} maternal death in developed countries while rheumatic fever is the commonest cause of valvular disease in pregnancy in developing countries. Improvement in neonatal and paediatric cardiac surgery has increased the incidence of congenital {{heart disease in}} pregnancy worldwide. Published data regarding heart disease in pregnancy (HDP) in KSA are scant and relatively old. This study examines the current status of HDP in KSA and describes the rationale and design of the suggested plan for HDP in KSA, i. e., the Registry Of Saudi Heart Disease And Pregnancy (ROSHDAP). MethodsA systematic search was conducted through the ProQuest MEDLINE® database using the <b>keyword</b> <b>phrase</b> “cardiovascular disease in pregnancy”. An extensive literature review about heart disease in pregnancywas performed. ResultsThere are only 4 available Saudi studies of HDP. The ROSHDAP study is expected to establish a foundation for Saudi research in this field and will create an extensive database that will enrich knowledge about HDP. All Saudi women with HDP who wish to participate are eligible for enrolment in the registry. Five phases are planned for the registry, and data will be collected prospectively, confidentially, and electronically. The data will be transmitted from participating centres to a central coordinating office for data management and analysis. ConclusionThe ROSHDAP study suggested in this article will provide contemporary data on HDP in KSA that will promote research and encourage evidence-based medical care of pregnant women with heart disease...|$|E
