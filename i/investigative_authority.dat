50|$|An {{academic}} {{study on}} the means of proliferation of child pornography {{on the internet is}} the initial point to start a discussion based on facts and to develop specific counter-measures. The study was realised by Bernd-Dieter Meier, professor at the Kriminalwissenschaftliches Institut (Institute for Criminology) at the University of Hanover. The study was based on the analysis of court records in Lower Saxony. The study showed that the World Wide Web just plays a minor role in the proliferation of child pornography. Based on this result the initiative focuses on the effective detection of abusive material, especially to facilitate the screening work material seized by the policy. The use of signatures (so to say the digital fingerprints) of already classified abusive material plays a pivotal role the development of further solutions.
