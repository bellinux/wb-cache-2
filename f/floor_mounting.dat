5|$|The FIA {{introduced}} {{more stringent}} {{tests on the}} cars at the Malaysian race to ensure <b>floor</b> <b>mounting</b> systems used by Ferrari and BMW Sauber were not in breach of the regulations. After the first race {{of the season in}} Australia, the McLaren team had requested clarification of the rules regarding systems that allowed the front of the car's undertray to move upwards under aerodynamic loading at high speed. Autosport magazine reported that this movement would potentially increase straight line speed. Massa and Räikkönen said the performance of the Ferrari F2007 car would not be compromised in any way by the required modifications.|$|E
2500|$|Long {{baseline}} systems {{get their}} {{name from the}} fact that the spacing of the baseline transponders is long or similar to the distance between the diver or vehicle and the transponders. [...] That is, the baseline transponders are typically mounted in the corners of an underwater work site within which the vehicle or diver operates. This method yields an ideal geometry for positioning, in which any given error in acoustic range measurements produce only about an equivalent position error. [...] This compares to SBL and USBL systems with shorter baselines where ranging disturbances of a given amount can result in much larger position errors. Further, the mounting of the baseline transponders on the sea floor eliminates the need for converting between reference frames, as is the case for USBL or SBL positioning systems mounted on moving vessels. Finally, sea <b>floor</b> <b>mounting</b> makes the positioning accuracy independent of water depth. [...] For these reasons LBL systems are generally applied to tasks where the required standard of positioning accuracy or reliability exceeds the capabilities of USBL and SBL systems.|$|E
50|$|A four-speed all-synchromesh manual {{gear box}} came as {{standard}} feature. The gear box was controlled with a column-mounted lever in the lower-priced models, but <b>floor</b> <b>mounting</b> of gear levers was by now {{seen as a}} preferred location, and the more expensive models provided this. The automatic gear box, where specified, was also controlled using a floor-mounted level positioned between the two separate front seats.|$|E

5000|$|The {{center of}} {{octagonal}} concrete mounting pad on the eight floor of 131-1A (which {{was meant to}} support a depression position finder) was usually the surveyed point {{at the end of}} the baseline (and thus the precise location of the base end station). A survey marker embedded in the tower's roof directly above this pad defined this point. Other observing instruments on lower floors of the tower were usually lined up directly beneath the eighth <b>floor</b> <b>mounting</b> pad and the rooftop marker, so they shared the same latitude and longitude. The pipe stands shown on floors six and seven of the Nahant Site 131-1A tower probably held azimuth scopes, which were less complex telescopes that determined bearings to a target but not its range from the tower.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of construction materials and models. Bar stools are often made of wood or metal. Bar stools are made with and without armrests, backs, and padding or upholstery on the seat surface. Bar stools can range from basic wooden designs to more complex ones with adjustable height. Extra tall and extra short are common features, as well as indoor bar stools and outdoor bar stools. In commercial settings, swivel and floor mounted bar stools are common. <b>Floor</b> <b>mounting</b> renders the stool immovable, so it cannot be stolen or used as a weapon in a bar fight. Floor-mounted stools are generally mounted on a column, but stools with legs can also be secured to the floor using metal brackets.|$|E

40|$|Increasingly, {{urban and}} high speed trains are {{incorporating}} tables (workstations) as common railway vehicle interior furniture because passengers prefer seating by bay tables. Among table design characteristics, {{the most challenging}} is meeting crashworthiness requirements. Past accident data and sled test results have shown that {{in the event of}} railway vehicle frontal impact, occupants located in the bay seating are exposed to chest and abdominal injuries upon contact with tables resulting from secondary collision. In some cases tables have tended to be structurally weak; they easily detach from the side walls and/or <b>floor</b> <b>mounting.</b> Subsequently these become unguided missiles that strike occupants, resulting in injuries. This paper presents an analysis of the crash performance of a typical bay table. The results provide some understanding of the table’s crash safety, giving an indication of its impact aggression. Table materials are characterised using quasi-static compressive tests. In addition, experimental dynamic (impact) tests are conducted using a pendulum representing a body block (mass). The results provide information about the possible loading of the table on the occupant {{in the event of a}} crash. Contact forces are compared with chest and abdominal injury tolerance thresholds to infer the collision injury potential. Recommendations are then made on design of bay tables to meet the “functional-strength-and-safety balance”. ...|$|E
