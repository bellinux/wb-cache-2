40|$|We {{have studied}} the finite-size effect on the dynamic {{behavior}} of graphene resonators and their applications in atomic mass detection using a continuum elastic model such as modified plate theory. In particular, we developed a model based on von Karman plate theory with including the <b>edge</b> <b>stress,</b> which arises from the imbalance between the coordination numbers of bulk atoms and edge atoms of graphene. It is shown that as {{the size of a}} graphene resonator decreases, the <b>edge</b> <b>stress</b> depending on the edge structure of a graphene resonator plays a critical role on both its dynamic and sensing performances. We found that the resonance behavior of graphene can be tuned not only through <b>edge</b> <b>stress</b> but also through nonlinear vibration, and that the detection sensitivity of a graphene resonator can be controlled by using the <b>edge</b> <b>stress.</b> Our study sheds light on the important role of the finite-size effect in the effective design of graphene resonators for their mass sensing applications...|$|E

KENSLAB, an elaborate finite element program is {{used to determine the}} concrete pavement responses: stresses and deflection under the defined parameters. The results obtained using this software is relatively close to known theoretical Westergaard solutions. Several other findings related to pavement performance and behavior are made through this study. Multiple axle configurations is less damaging than single axle configuration in terms of fatigue life. Increasing the thickness is very effective in reducing the <b>edge</b> <b>stress.</b> Using concrete with higher modulus of elasticity brings only a small increase to the <b>edge</b> <b>stress.</b> Increasing the slab thickness is {{the most effective way to}} increase the fatigue life. Increasing subgrade modulus is more effective in reducing corner deflection than decreasing <b>edge</b> <b>stress.</b> The availability of tied shoulder construction gives significant impact in both reducing <b>edge</b> <b>stress</b> and corner deflection.

40|$|We have {{performed}} first-principles calculations of graphene edge stresses, which display two interesting quantum manifestations {{absent from the}} classical interpretation: the armchair <b>edge</b> <b>stress</b> oscillates with a nanoribbon width, and the zigzag <b>edge</b> <b>stress</b> is noticeably reduced by spin polarization. Such quantum stress effects in turn manifest in mechanical edge twisting and warping instability, showing features not captured by empirical potentials or continuum theory.

In the case of end-supported suspended nanoribbons that we study here, past experiments and computations have identified a range of equilibrium morphologies, in particular for graphene flakes, yet a unified understanding of their relative stability remains elusive. Here, we employ atomic-scale simulations and a composite framework based on isotropic elastic plate theory to chart out the morphological stability space of suspended nanoribbons with respect to intrinsic (ribbon elasticity) and engineered (ribbon geometry) parameters, and the combination of edge and body actuation. The computations highlight a rich morphological shape space that can be naturally classified into two competing shapes, bending-like and twist-like, depending {{on the distribution of}} ripples across the interacting edges. The linearized elastic framework yields exact solutions for these rippled shapes. For compressive <b>edge</b> <b>stresses,</b> the body strain emerges as a key variable that controls their relative stability and in extreme cases stabilizes co-existing transverse ripples. Tensile <b>edge</b> <b>stresses</b> lead to dimples within the ribbon core that decay into the edges, a feature of obvious significance for stretchable nanoelectronics.

However, zigzag edge reconstruction produces graphene flakes with a six-fold symmetry, but with rounded edges. This shape is dominated by near zigzag edges.
