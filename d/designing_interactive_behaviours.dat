40|$|Augmented Reality (AR) {{has been}} {{recognised}} {{as one of}} the promising technologies for the gaming industry. In this study, the authors intend to apply AR technology to develop an interactive educational game. This paper presents an AR featured educational game specifically designed for 4 - 7 years old pre-school children. The principal objective of this game is to enable children to learn various abstract concepts, such as colour mixing, mathematics and 2 D- 3 D geometrical shape recognition. This game allows users to interact with both onscreen (intangible) and physical objects (tangible) at the same time; different interaction forms including the touch screen (click) and AR game (rotate) are designed for better interaction with the real world and learning. This paper focuses on the details of the <b>design</b> and <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Furthermore, beyond the needs of children, this game also serves for parents through the Token Economy method; parents can control the kids’ contacting time with portable devices, and track and modify their everyday learning patterns. A pilot study implementing mix method was used to gather user’s feedback is also described in this paper...|$|R

The physiotherapist-patient interaction is the medium through which physiotherapy is practiced. However, to date little physiotherapy research literature reports on physiotherapists' <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviours</b> in clinical practice. The objectives {{of this study}} were to explore, interpret and describe experienced cardiorespiratory physiotherapists' understandings of their <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviours</b> when treating chronically breathless patients and to make recommendations for practice. The study is located in the interpretive research paradigm. It has adopted a hermeneutic phenomenological approach underpinned by a relativist ontological stance and Gadamerian philosophy (1975 / 2004). Five experienced cardiorespiratory physiotherapists' were video recorded in a natural treatment setting with a chronically breathless patient. Data were generated through a video-cued recall and reflection, and a follow-up interview with each physiotherapist. Three themes were derived from the physiotherapists' accounts: 'Creating a facilitative space', 'Accessing and attending to your world' and 'Sharing my world'. These were considered to be key dimensions of physiotherapists' understandings of their <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviours.</b> The concept of 'Merging Worlds - facilitating the journey to a shared understanding and purpose, and safe achievement of purpose' draws together these key dimensions and represents the nature of the interactional behaviours of experienced physiotherapists when managing chronically breathless patients. The challenge of explicating tacit practice knowledge was observed during the process of data generation. This issue was considered alongside the thematic interpretation and the concept of 'Merging Worlds' to inform {{the development of a new}} model of physiotherapy practice: Mindful, Reciprocal Interaction. A series of questions to facilitate explication of, and critical reflection on <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviours</b> were developed for use by physiotherapists to enhance their <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviours</b> during encounters with patients. The findings of this study provide new knowledge for physiotherapy practice. 2 EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Designing {{domestic}} {{user interfaces}} for broad user populations means designing {{for the average}} user. To design for more personally intuitive interfaces detailed <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviours</b> need to be captured and described {{in order to better}} inform the design process. By utilising technologies such as interface skins, log file analysis and user interface description languages, the PROSKIN project is developing an empirical tool for quantitative capture, description and analysis of <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviour</b> in a non-invasive and situated context. The purpose of the tool is to identify user groups by distinguishing behaviour or trait which will allow designers to develop more personally relevant user interfaces. The tool itself facilitates the analyses of large datasets of users and their <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviours.</b> This will allow designers to produce interface skins for user groups of similar interactive profile and subsequently providing a less average user experience. ...|$|R

The <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviour</b> of Indonesian mothers was found to be more similar to that of Dutch and Surinam-Dutch mothers than to that of Japanese mothers. Mothers’ supportive behaviour in the structured play session was significantly related to their sensitivity at home.

40|$|Background Relationships between {{support staff}} and clients with {{intellectual}} disability (ID) {{are important for}} quality of care, especially when dealing with challenging behaviour. Building upon an interpersonal model, this study investigates the influence of client challenging behaviour, staff attitude and staff emotional intelligence on <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviour</b> {{of one of these}} relationship partners, being support staff. Method A total of 158 support staff members completed a questionnaire on staff <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviour</b> for 158 clients with ID and challenging behaviour, as well as two questionnaires on staff interpersonal attitude and emotional intelligence. Results Confronted with challenging behaviour as opposed to no challenging behaviour, staff reported less friendly, more assertive control and less support-seeking interpersonal behaviour. Also, staff used more proactive thinking and more self-reflection in dealing with challenging behaviour. Staff interpersonal attitude in general, mainly a harsh-dominant-resentful attitude, had a significant influence on most staff <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviours</b> towards an individual client with challenging behaviour. The influence of staff emotional intelligence, specifically intrapersonal abilities, on staff <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviour</b> towards an individual client with challenging behaviour was somewhat limited. Conclusions This research supports the necessity for training staff in general interpersonal attitudes towards clients as well as training in intrapersonal emotional intelligence, when confronted with challenging behaviour. Future research should focus more on the bidirectional dynamics of staff and client interactions...|$|R

40|$|Causally {{uncertain}} (CU) people {{struggle to}} understand the causes of events in their social world. This struggle creates difficulties in their social interactions with others, as well as driving them to seek out social information {{in order to reduce}} their uncertainty (Boucher & Jacobson, 2012; Weary & Edwards, 1996). Social Network Sites (SNSs) provide ideal platforms for acquiring social information, as well as new ways to communicate with others. People generally engage in either passive or <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviours</b> on these sites. Engaging in <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviours</b> is generally beneficial for people, whereas engaging in passive behaviours is usually detrimental (Burke, 2011; Doodson et al., 2013). Given these differences, this paper was interested in what determines people’s SNS behaviours. It was predicted that due to the difficulties CU people have in their social interactions, that causal uncertainty would be associated with fewer <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Furthermore, {{as a result of these}} difficulties, it was predicted that CU people would prefer passive SNS behaviours and therefore engage in more of them. Two survey studies were conducted using Facebook as the SNS. Study 1 was correlational in design and examined the effect that trait causal uncertainty had on participants’ general Facebook use and attitudes. Study 2 was an experiment and was interested in people’s passive and <b>interactive</b> information seeking <b>behaviours</b> on Facebook and whether causal uncertainty would influence them. Study 2 primed participants with causal uncertainty, presented them with four hypothetical uncertain Facebook scenarios, and then asked participants to indicate the Facebook <b>behaviours</b> (passive or <b>interactive)</b> they would use to respond to these scenarios. Both studies hypotheses were unsupported, with Study 1 finding nothing and the primes failing to have an effect on participants’ behaviours in Study 2. However, Study 2 also included a measure of trait CU, which was found to be associated with more passive and <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Therefore, the paper still provides support found for the notion that causal uncertainty influences people’s SNS behaviours. The findings and their implications are discussed...|$|R
