5|$|Front-end loaders are {{commonly}} used to remove snow especially from sidewalks, parking lots, and other areas too small for using snowplows and other heavy equipment. They are sometimes used as snowplows with a snowplow attachment but commonly have a bucket or snowbasket, which {{can also be used}} to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplow or <b>dump</b> <b>truck.</b> Front end loaders with large box-like front end attachment are used to clear snow in parking lots in malls and other institutions.|$|E
5|$|Winter service {{vehicles}} are usually {{based on a}} <b>dump</b> <b>truck</b> chassis, which are then converted into winter {{service vehicles}} either by the manufacturer or an aftermarket third-party. A typical modification involves the replacement of steel components of the vehicle with corrosion resistant aluminium or fibreglass, waterproofing any exposed electronic components, replacement of the stock hopper with a specially designed gritting body, {{the addition of a}} plow frame, reinforcement of the wheels, bumpers to support the heavy blade, and the addition of extra headlamps, a light bar, and retroreflectors for visibility.|$|E

5|$|Blast Corps is a single-player action video game. The player {{controls}} {{vehicles to}} destroy buildings, farms, and other {{structures in the}} path of a runaway nuclear missile carrier. The player fails if the carrier collides with an object. The eight demolition vehicles vary in the way they clear structures: the bulldozer rams, the <b>dump</b> <b>truck</b> drifts, the lightweight buggy crashes from higher ground, the tricycle shoots missiles, another truck presses outwards from its sides, and robot mechs tumble and stomp from the land and the air. The player must transfer between vehicles and other machinery to solve puzzles. Objectives include transporting timed explosive crates and bridging gaps. The game's puzzles increase in difficulty as the player progresses through its 57 levels.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} that {{specially}} designed winter service vehicles are not available for plowing, other service or construction vehicles can be used instead: among those used by various authorities are graders, bulldozers, skid loaders, pickup trucks and rubbish trucks. Front-end loaders {{can also be used}} to plow snow. Either a snowplow attachment can be mounted on the loader's arm in place of the bucket, or the bucket or snowbasket can be used to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplow or <b>dump</b> <b>truck,</b> which then hauls it away. Snowplows are dangerous to overtake; often, the oncoming lane may not be completely free of snow. In addition, the plow blade causes considerable spray of snow on both sides, which can obscure the vision of other road users.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, York, Pennsylvania-based {{department}} store chain The Bon-Ton acquired the AM's chain, converting all outlets to The Bon-Ton. Later that year, on December 14, 17-year-old Cynthia Wiggins of Buffalo {{was struck by}} a <b>dump</b> <b>truck</b> while trying to get to her first day of work in the mall's food court from a NFTA Metro bus stop on Walden Avenue. The incident sparked allegations from Buffalo's African-American community that Pyramid did not want people from Buffalo's predominantly minority East Side to have easy access to the mall. In settling a wrongful death claim against Walden Galleria and NFTA Metro and to prevent a boycott of the mall, the bus stop was soon moved to a point inside the mall, where it remains today. Bonwit Teller closed off its upper level in 1996 as part of the chain's restructuring, with Old Navy soon opening in the store's former upper level. By the end of the year, Bonwit Teller had closed the rest of its store as well, with the lower level becoming the area's first Bed Bath & Beyond store in 1997. Also in 1996, sporting apparel retailer Finish Line opened what was then one of its largest stores, in the space vacated by Filene's Basement two years previous.|$|E
