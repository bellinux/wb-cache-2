40|$|<b>Craved</b> <b>foods</b> {{are thought}} to be those that are well liked but restricted. However, this claim has not been {{demonstrated}} empirically. Japanese female undergraduate students (n = 144) completed a questionnaire measuring their craving for, degree of liking, and frequency of restricting their eating of 47 widely consumed foods. The food with the highest mean craving score was rice. We plotted the craving scores as a function of restriction and liking scores for the 47 <b>foods.</b> The students’ <b>craving</b> scores were strongly correlated with their restriction scores and liking scores. Thus, <b>craved</b> <b>foods</b> are those that are restricted and liked. However, in both scatter plots, rice was an outlier. While it was the most <b>craved</b> <b>food,</b> neither the restriction nor liking score of rice was very high. These findings were consistent with the view that <b>craved</b> <b>foods</b> are generally liked, yet restricted, implying the generation of food related conflicts.

50|$|There are two hormones, leptin and ghrelin, {{that are}} {{important}} in appetite control. Leptin, released by adipose tissue, is a hormone that inhibits appetite and increases energy expenditure. Ghrelin, released from the stomach, is a hormone that increases appetite and reduces energy expenditure. Sleep deprivation can cause a 19% decrease in the level of leptin. Subjects were deprived of sleep for 2 nights (4 hours per night) and got compensation of sleep for the next 2 nights (10 hours per night). Leptin levels decreased by 18% and ghrelin levels increased by 28%. There was an increase in hunger level by 23 which is probably due to the reduction leptin level. Subjects also preferred high carbohydrate foods (sweets, salty food and starchy <b>food).</b> <b>Craving</b> for salty food increased by 45%. Sleep deprivation can cause people to intake food for emotional/psychological need rather than caloric need of the body.|$|E

50|$|Papadopoulos and Brennan (2015) {{recently}} found that across many reviewed studies, relationships emerged between experiencing weight stigma and both BMI and difficulty losing weight in weight loss treatment seeking adults. However {{the findings are}} somewhat mixed. They also report evidence that experiencing weight stigma is related to poor medication adherence. Among weight loss treatment-seeking adults, experiencing weight stigma might exacerbate weight- and health-related quality of life. This review along with reviews by Vartanian and Smyth (2013) and Puhl and Suh (2015) have also found that across several studies and in both adults and children, experiencing weight stigma is related to decreased exercise behavior overall, as well as decreased motivation to exercise, decreased exercise self-efficacy, and increased <b>food</b> <b>craving</b> and tendency to overeat. It {{is important to note}} that these effects of weight stigma on exercise and physical activity emerge independent of Body Mass Index, suggesting that weight stigma becomes a unique barrier to physical activity outside of barriers that may be associated with overweight and obesity in particular. Finally, across many studies, Puhl and Suh (2015) also found that experiencing weight stigma is related to many physiological consequences as well, including increased blood pressure, augmented cortisol reactivity, elevated oxidative stress, impaired glycemic control/elevated HbA1c, and increased systemic inflammation, all of which have notable consequences for physical health and disease.|$|E

40|$|<b>Food</b> <b>craving</b> {{refers to}} an intense desire or urge to consume a {{specific}} food. In Western or Westernized societies, these craved foods usually have high palatability and are energy dense, that is, they have high sugar and/or fat content. Accordingly, the most often craved food is chocolate. <b>Food</b> <b>craving</b> is a multidimensional experience as it includes cognitive (e. g. thinking about food), emotional (e. g. desire to eat or changes in mood), behavioral (e. g. seeking and consuming food), and physiological (e. g. salivation) aspects.

40|$|Abstract: Food cravings, aversions and pica {{are common}} during {{pregnancy}} {{and may have}} a significant input on pregnancy progress and outcome. A study was carried out to determine the frequency and duration of pronounced dietary cravings, aversions and pica during pregnancy among 204 pregnant and lactating women attending two health facilities in Dar es Salaam City, Tanzania. Nausea and vomiting were reported by 82. 8 % of all women of which 43. 2 % experienced severe nausea alone, 9. 5 % severe vomiting alone and 35. 5 % experienced severe vomiting and nausea. Mild cases {{of each of the}} symptoms either occurring alone or both of them occurring together were also reported. Both behaviours were observed more in < 3 months of pregnancy. The proportions of women with dietary cravings, aversions, and pica were 73. 5 %, 70. 1 % and 63. 7 % of all women respectively. More women (70. 1 %) experienced both food cravings and aversions than either symptom alone. <b>Foods</b> <b>craved</b> most were meat (23. 3 %), mangoes (22. 7 %), yoghurt (20. 0 %) oranges (20. 0 %), plantain (15. 3 %) and soft drinks (13. 3 %). Foods avoided most were rice (36. 4 %), meat (36. 4 %) and fish (30. 8 %). Eggs, beans, tea and stiff porridge were also avoided. Reasons given for avoiding foods were unpleasant smell/taste (10. 3 %), to reduce nausea (11. 8 %), no particular reason (58. 3 %) and dislike by foetus (belief) (3. 9 %). Pica was experienced by 63. 7 % % of the women and soil, ice and ash were the most commonly non-food substances eaten.

40|$|One of {{the most}} often used {{instruments}} {{for the assessment of}} food cravings is the Food Cravings Questionnaire (FCQ), which consists of a trait (FCQ-T; 39 items) and state (FCQ-S; 15 items) version. Scores on the FCQ-T {{have been found to be}} positively associated with eating pathology, body mass index (BMI), low dieting success and increases in state <b>food</b> <b>craving</b> during cognitive tasks involving appealing food stimuli. The current studies evaluated reliability and validity of a reduced version of the FCQ-T consisting of 15 items only (FCQ-T-r). Study 1 was a questionnaire study conducted online among students (N = 323). In study 2, female students (N = 70) performed a working memory task involving food and neutral pictures. Study 1 indicated a one-factorial structure and high internal consistency (α = 0. 94) of the FCQ-T-r. Scores of the FCQ-T-r were positively correlated with BMI and negatively correlated with dieting success. In study 2, participants reported higher state <b>food</b> <b>craving</b> after the task compared to before. This increase was positively correlated with the FCQ-T-r. Hours since the last meal positively predicted <b>food</b> <b>craving</b> before the task when controlling for FCQ-T-r scores and the interaction of both variables. Contrarily, FCQ-T-r scores positively predicted <b>food</b> <b>craving</b> after the task when controlling for food deprivation and the interaction term. Thus, trait <b>food</b> <b>craving</b> was specifically associated with state <b>food</b> <b>craving</b> triggered by palatable food-cues, but not with state <b>food</b> <b>craving</b> related to plain hunger. Results indicate high reliability of the FCQ-T-r. Replicating studies that used the long version, small-to-medium correlations with BMI and dieting success could be found. Finally, scores on the FCQ-T-r predicted cue-elicited <b>food</b> <b>craving,</b> providing further support of its validity. The FCQ-T-r constitutes a succinct, valid and reliable self-report measure to efficiently assess experiences of <b>food</b> <b>craving</b> as a trait...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Food</b> <b>craving</b> {{refers to}} an intense desire to consume a {{specific}} food. The Food Cravings Questionnaires (FCQs) assess food cravings on a trait and a state level. Method: The current study examined half-year retest-reliability of the Food Cravings Questionnaire-Trait-reduced (FCQ-T-r) and the Food Cravings Questionnaire-State (FCQ-S) and reports associations with current food deprivation in female students. Results: The FCQ-T-r had higher retest-reliability (rtt =. 74) than the FCQ-S (rtt =. 39). Although trait <b>food</b> <b>craving</b> was correlated with state <b>food</b> <b>craving,</b> it was unaffected by current food deprivation. Conclusions: Although state and trait <b>food</b> <b>craving</b> are interdependent, the FCQs are able to differentiate between the two. As scores of the FCQ-T-r represent a stable trait, but are also sensitive to changes in eating behavior, they may be useful for {{the investigation of the}} course of eating disorders and obesity...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the association between external eating style and <b>food</b> <b>craving</b> experienced during exposure to food cues in virtual reality (VR) environments in both clinical and non-clinical samples. According to the externality theory, people with external eating experience higher reactivity when exposed to food cues, which in turn increases the probability of overeating. Forty patients with eating disorders (23 with bulimia nervosa and 17 with binge eating disorder) and 78 undergraduate students were exposed to 10 different food cues in four VR environments (kitchen, dining room, bedroom, and café). After 30 seconds of exposure to each VR environment, <b>food</b> <b>craving</b> was assessed using a visual analog scale. External, emotional and restrictive eating styles were also assessed using the DEBQ. The results showed a strong association between external eating and cue-elicited <b>food</b> <b>craving.</b> After controlling for the presence of eating disorder diagnosis, external eating was the best predictor of reported <b>food</b> <b>craving.</b> The results lend support to the externality theory but highlight the need for further research in specific patterns of functioning in patients with bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder...|$|E

40|$|Reproductive {{disorders}} and psychological distress are common co-morbidities of obesity in young women. Psychological and reproductive disturbances {{may also be}} associated with increased food cravings but the relationships between these factors have not been explored. This study aimed to explore the pattern of food cravings and to determine the relationship between psychological distress, reproductive health and food cravings in overweight and obese young women using baseline data in a weight loss trial. A total of 198 young women were included in this analysis (BMI 33. 3 +/- 0. 3 kg/m(2), age 28 +/- 0. 3 years). The most frequently <b>craved</b> <b>food</b> item was chocolate (3. 9 +/- 0. 08 i. e., sometimes-often). The most frequently <b>craved</b> <b>food</b> categories were fast foods (2. 6 +/- 0. 07) and sweets (2. 5 +/- 0. 05). Psychological distress was significantly correlated with food cravings (R(2) = 0. 18, P 0. 05). Participants with menstrual disturbances had greater fast food cravings independent of age, BMI and PCOS status (P 0. 05). These results suggest that psychological distress, hyperandrogenemia and menstrual disturbances are associated with greater food cravings.
