25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{controversy}} concerning the capital, and public dissatisfaction of economic development, Uri party lost much of its popularity. When the Uri party was defeated in by-elections held on 30 April 2005, losing every one of the 23 electoral districts, Uri Party lost its majority in the National Assembly. Facing the outcome of his unpopularity, Roh took a rather strange measure to manage the government when he proposed a grand coalition with the opposition <b>Grand</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party.</b> Roh's rationale was that since it was impossible to continue his presidency with an approval rate of around 20 percent, a grand coalition comprising the Uri party and the <b>Grand</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> was desirable, and that the difference between both parties in terms of political agendas was actually minute. Roh promised he would yield much of his power and might even resign from office if a grand coalition was successfully launched.|$|E
25|$|Despite high {{expectations}} in the beginning, his presidency encountered strong {{opposition from the}} conservative <b>Grand</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> and media. They constantly accused him of incompetence, and insulting criticism was frequently published in the media. As a result, many of Roh's policies, including a plan to move the capital, and a plan to form a coalition with the opposition, were also attacked and made little progress.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a part of}} his {{balanced}} {{national development}} campaign to reverse the concentration of wealth in Seoul, Roh also pursued a plan to relocate the capital 100 miles away to Chungcheong, ostensibly to relieve congestion.

After much controversy, the Constitutional Court obviated Roh's plans by ruling that the relocation of the capital was unconstitutional because it 'opposes the custom that has to be considered as the constitution', thus inflicting a huge blow to Roh's political standing. Roh's plan was then amended to the creation of an [...] "administrative capital," [...] though this plan has also not yet seen completion.

40|$|AbstractThis paper scrutinizes the intra-party {{education}} of the political parties that hold a parliamentary group in the Turkish <b>Grand</b> <b>National</b> Assembly. These <b>parties</b> are the governing party Justice and Development Party (JDP), the major opposition party Republican Peoples Party (RPP), the ultra-nationalist party Nationalist Action Party (NAP) and the Kurdish Movement-Sympathetic/Corroborator Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP). Drawing on a critical interpretative analysis of regulations, by-Laws and curriculum, it conveys the impact of intra-party education to democracy. By attempting to position the parties within Duverger's political party system, it speculates on whether the political parties attitude in the organization, recruitment {{and content of the}} education programs reflect their attitude on democracy. It is argued that ideologically loaded parties may display democratic attitudes within the party whereas this attitude may not be found in the broader spectrum of Turkish political life as ideology curbs the latitude of constituency...|$|R

Many of the Uri party's supporters who identify as liberals were enraged at Roh holding that his party was not really different from the conservative opposition. The <b>Grand</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party,</b> enjoying relatively strong approval rate but still bent on revenge for the party's defeat in major elections, repeatedly declined to initiate a negotiation for the coalition.
