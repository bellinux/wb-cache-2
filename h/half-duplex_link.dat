Figure 1 is an overview of the WSMR water supply system. The WSCS provides water for approximately 90 square miles of the 3, 700 square mile missile range. The WSCS was designed and installed in 1990 and in need of upgrading and repair. The system was evaluated and found to be only moderately functional. The WSCS consists of an IBM compatible personal computer (PC) based user interface, located at the WSMR Water Plant and Fire Dept. and industrial-type computers called Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) based stations at the Water Plant, water wells and tanks. The stations communicate over a 400 MHz radio <b>half-duplex</b> <b>link.</b> The serial message utilizes the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) and Block Check Character (BBC) type of error checking. The Master station controls pumping by downloading pump settings to the slave stations. The slave stations upload data to the master such as tank level, pump status, energy usage, gallons of water pumped and various alarms. The system was analyzed and the design was found to be sound. The system did require improvements. These improvements include adding surge suppressors, software upgrades, absolute reading flow rate sensors, and providing adequate environmental cooling for the control system. Procedures for periodic maintenance and calibration of the sensors and schedules for radio equipment maintenance were also developed. Software modifications to reduce WSMR energy usage by reducing pumping during peak energy demand times are being integrated into the WSCS. The peak energy demand times are determined by historical energy usage data...|$|E

In this paper, we investigate {{the performance of a}} VLC network with full-duplex optical links. We propose two contention protocols, named U-ALOHA and FD-CSMA, to utilize the full-duplex capability effectively. Their performances in terms of channel utilization and network throughput are analyzed and simulated and compared with a protocol with <b>half-duplex</b> <b>links.</b> The results show that the proposed protocols can effectively exploit the full-duplex capability. U-ALOHA achieves high channel utilization on the downlink channel while FD-CSMA has good performance on both downlink and uplink channels.

40|$|Transmit {{precoding}} {{strategies in}} multiple-input multiple- output (MIMO) systems provide {{a mechanism for}} increasing the performance of point-to-point links and enable spatial division multiple access in multi-user networks. However, communication node mobility in such systems can lead to rapid channel variation which limits the quality of attainable channel state information (CSI). This work explores the performance loss of point-to-point and multi- user precoding and detection strategies based on CSI which goes out of date and channel distribution (correlation) information which provides a more average channel representation and ultimately stability in achievable performance. This correlation-based method is a linear beamforming precoding strategy based on channel distribution information {{in the form of}} a full spatial correlation matrix for each user. This algorithm is shown to provide highly stable communication, with a throughput that is higher than that for optimal precoders operating on outdated CSI, in a time-variant environment, indicating that this approach can operate with significantly reduced feedback frequency. Furthermore, the dissertation demonstrates the use of the well-known Kronecker and Weichselberger models to parameterize the full correlation matrix to enable further reduction in the amount of feedback data required for implementation of the new beamforming technique. Channel measurements based on an experimentally obtained MIMO channels in indoor and outdoor environments are used in defining the statistical nature of the wireless channel. Finally, the examined beamforming algorithms are extended to work for all possible scheduled, <b>half-duplex</b> <b>link</b> topologies using explicit channel state information or distribution information. Each type of derived beamformer, whether utilizing CSI or CDI, can provide additional scheduling tools for the medium access control and other network layers in optimizing the overall network throughput, in a cross-layer fashion, depending on the state of the network and available information at the node...|$|E

40|$|Cellular NetworksInternational audienceUsing {{additional}} antennas and {{signal processing}} techniques {{to build a}} full-duplex radio is becoming a popular topic in the networking research community. However, additional antennas are used for MIMO (multiple input multiple output) transmissions, traditionally, and it is well-known that {{increasing the number of}} antennas on either transmitter or receiver side increases the MIMO link capacity. Therefore, deployment of extra antennas on a transceiver has twofold applications, first increasing the capacity of <b>half-duplex</b> MIMO <b>link,</b> second providing full-duplex capability for the radio. In this work, we look at the performance comparison between using multiple-antennas for capacity enhancement in a <b>half-duplex</b> MIMO <b>link</b> with that of utilizing them to build a full-duplex radio.

We show that the permutation routing problem can be solved as efficiently on a linear array augmented with a <b>half-duplex</b> wrap-around <b>link,</b> as on a linear array with an augmented broadcast bus. We also present a routing algorithm for a two-dimensional (2 D) mesh with <b>half-duplex</b> wrap-around <b>links</b> whose run time is close to that of the best known algorithm for routing on a 2 D mesh with broadcast buses in each dimension.

40|$|In-band {{full-duplex}} {{wireless communication}} (FD), i. e. transmission and {{reception at the}} same time at the same frequency, is an emerging research topic, driven by the increasing demand for mobile data traffic in the crowded radio spectrum. Besides promising up to twice the spectral efficiency, additional advantages are being explored. The main issue in FD is strong self-interference (SI) from the transmitter (TX) into the local receiver (RX). In typical links, over 90 dB total SI-rejection is required to fully compete with <b>half-duplex</b> <b>links.</b> This rejection is achieved by combining SI-isolation and cancellation in different domains. This work shows that impairments in the radio components limit the achievable SI-cancellation in the digital domain, typically requiring at least 40 dB SI-rejection in the analog and RF domain. Implementing such analog cancellation paths to achieve competitive link budgets with CMOS integration potential, small form factor, limited complexity and low power consumption remains challenging. This work studies the feasibility of FD using a custom designed CMOS front-end. Full implementation details and analysis are presented of a 65 -nanometer mixer-first front-end with a vector modulator (VM) downmixer for SI-cancellation. Using this front-end, the impact of several transceiver impairments on its full-duplex operation were experimentally investigated, such as distortion, phase noise, image rejection and transmitter impairments. The receiver was found to have over 90 dB linear link budget potential in a 16. 25 MHz bandwidth, when combined with only 20 dB worst-case antenna isolation, thanks to its highly linear rejection of SI present at the receiver input. An improved second front-end was developed in 65 nm CMOS, targeting over 100 dB linear link budget, supporting a significantly higher transmit power, increased receiver linearity and reduced noise floor. Transistor-level simulations of the full system showed the reduced NF, increased linearity and expected cancellation behavior. Preliminary measurements on the stand-alone power amplifier are also presented. Complete measurements are outside the time span of this thesis work. Overall, this thesis demonstrates that vector-modulator downmixers are a promising building block for SI-cancelling full-duplex front-ends, enabling highly integrated full-duplex radios that can compete with relaxed <b>half-duplex</b> <b>links...</b>|$|R

40|$|The eXplicit Control Protocol (XCP) was {{released}} as an RFC draft on October 17, 2004. In this paper we have {{looked into the}} theory behind the development of XCP. In addition, we created a working Linux implementation of XCP {{as part of our}} investigation of the protocol. This paper also discusses the performance results we got by using our implementation of XCP, and compares them to TCP and other papers regarding XCP. The XCP protocol has been developed as a new way to improve the congestion control, bandwidth utilization and congestion avoidance algorithm in TCP. In contrast to most other enhancements of the TCP protocol, XCP does not try to be backward compatible with existing TCP implementations. XCP introduces a new layer in the TCP/IP stack, which is used to add an XCP header in front of the regular TCP packet. The main difference between TCP and XCP is that an XCP stream allows routers to explicit set how much bandwidth to allow in the XCP packets passing through them. By using explicit feedback from the network, XCP promises to prevent queue buildup in routers and packet drops caused by congestion. XCP allows the use of more aggressive algorithms, than in use by TCP, in order to quickly distribute any available bandwidth amongst XCP-enabled TCP-flows. Our Linux implementation was based on the original XCP RFC draft. We implemented XCP as a separate protocol, situated between TCP and IP in the Linux kernel. Our goal was to create an implementation of XCP that would run without the need to change the existing TCP or IP code. By creating the XCP protocol as a Linux kernel module, we managed to achieve this goal. However, the very nature of XCP made implementing it as a separate protocol difficult, as the XCP protocol needed intimate knowledge of various TCP concepts; such as the congestion window and TCP-flows. Simulations have shown XCP to be able to prevent queue buildup in routers, {{while at the same time}} maximizing throughput. Our tests managed to confirm these results, showing that XCP can be superior to TCP in some environments. However, our tests also show that XCP is vulnerable to a number of common scenarios, where it fails to work as intended. Scenarios such as <b>half-duplex</b> <b>links,</b> bursty applications and incorrect router setup make the XCP routers return invalid feedback back to the XCP hosts. Incorrect feedback from the XCP routers can lead to queue build-up, packet drops and oscillatory behavior, which are the same problems as XCP set out to solve...|$|R

Furthermore, in implanted systems with many neural recording electrodes, the data rate of the wireless link will need to be quite high since each recording electrode can produce about 120 kbps of data. For low-power operation, inductively-coupled near-field wireless links have shown great promise and were used to develop a power-efficient data link for biomedical implants. A prototype bi-directional, <b>half-duplex</b> wireless <b>link</b> based on inductive coupling was designed in a 0. 18 [mu]m process. The uplink (i. e. data transmission from the internal transceiver) was designed to use an impedance modulation strategy. Since this technique only requires a single local oscillator (LO) in the external transceiver, the energy expenditure of the implanted transceiver is minimized. Simulated uplink data transfer rates of up to 10 Mbps has been shown. A PWM based ASK coding strategy was used for the downlink (i. e. data transmission to the implanted device). The downlink is able to achieve a data transfer rate of up to 1. 5 Mbps. A technique to reduce BER of inductive coupling links due to pulse-width distortion effects by pre-distorting the transmitted data is also presented. A calibration technique to reduce the resonant frequency mismatch between the two magnetically coupled resonators is also shown. by Daniel Prashanth Kumar. Thesis (S. M.)

The convenience of hands-free links is invaluable in teleconferencing situations, automobiles and even in personal communications. The loud-speaker and microphone on a hands-free set are inherently coupled acoustically, producing an echo which degrades the quality of conversation over such a link. The conventional acoustic echo cancellation method is gain control which provides a <b>half-duplex</b> communication <b>link.</b> Research into adaptive filters which can provide a full-duplex communication link is intense but transparent transmission of speech over a hands-free link remains an elusive goal. Conventional acoustic echo cancellers are concerned with minimizing an objective measure of the level of echo. This thesis presents a study of two adaptive filtering structures which are based on the goal of providing the best subjective echo cancellation possible. The adaptive filtering algorithms attempt to give the echo the same spectral shape as the absolute hearing threshold curve, in order to minimize the echo's audibility. The filtered-E LMS algorithm, considered first, was found not to perform the kind of frequency weighting desired. A proposed subband adaptive filter with perceptually-based adaptive tap assignment, when trained with natural speech, is capable of providing a noticeable improvement in audible echo cancellation; however, when trained with bandlimited speech, the algorithm's performance was found to be only slightly better or comparable to the fixed tap assignment algorithm in terms of audible echo cancellation.

Each mobile station (MS) is either directly connected to a base station (BS) and/or con-nected to a relay station. We first derive closed-form solutions or upper-bound of the ergodic and outage capacities of four different downlink data relaying schemes: A direct scheme, a relay scheme, a selection scheme, and a cooperative scheme. The selection scheme selects the best access link between the BS and an MS. For all schemes, {{the capacity of the}} BS-RS link is assumed to be always larger than that of RS-MS <b>link.</b> <b>Half-duplex</b> channel use and repe-tition based relaying schemes are assumed for relaying operations.

The current activity in building Gigabit speed networks, growing network bandwidth and intensive network applications led to flow control and congestion control became a high priority in network design and research. Recently, the IEEE congestion management study group has been set up to deal with the congestion and flow control problems in Ethernet networks. They had standardized a method (IEEE 802. 3 x standard) to provide a pause-based flow control, which is applicable to all version of full-duplex Ethernet. The aim of this standard is to improve throughput, latency and packet loss. There are some problems for the IEEE 802. 3 x standard; for instance, pause-based flow control can potentially cause heal-of-line blocking and more congestion, and in some cases quality of service (QoS) can not operate properly due to equal punishment for different traffic priority.
