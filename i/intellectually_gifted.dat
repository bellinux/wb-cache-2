Members stress that intercollegiate athletic programs should operate in harmony with the educational mission of each institution. Schools are committed to maintaining common boundaries to keep athletics strong yet in proportion to their overall academic mission.

Conference tenets are usually more restrictive than those of the NCAA Division III regarding season length, number of contests and post-season competition.|$|E
25|$|A written {{document}} that addresses a student's specific individual needs. It may specify accommodations, materials, or classroom instruction. IEPs are often created {{for students with}} disabilities, who are {{required by law to}} have an IEP when appropriate.

Some students may be <b>intellectually</b> <b>gifted</b> in addition to having learning and/or attentional disabilities, and may have an IEP that includes, for instance, enrichment activities as a means of alleviating boredom or frustration, or as a reward for on-task behavior. In order to warrant such an IEP, a student needs to be diagnosed with a separate emotional or learning disability that is not simply the result of being unchallenged in a typical classroom. These are also known as Individual Program Plans, or IPPs.|$|E

While her husband busied himself with his military and governmental career, Grand Duchess Olga ruled her family with an iron hand. She demanded complete obedience from her children.

Her second son, Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich, who was not <b>intellectually</b> <b>gifted</b> (she called him a fool), was a constant source of disappointment for her. In 1879, Olga with Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna arranged the marriage between her only daughter, Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia, with Frederick Francis III, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Maria Pavlovna's brother. Anastasia carried some bitterness about her upbringing and relationship with her mother - her daughter Cäcilie recounts that at a party to celebrate her engagement, when she committed some infraction she was sent to bed by Olga like a naughty child. There was also an incident involving an apricot tree, which belonged to Anastasia but whose fruit she was not allowed to eat.|$|E

In the original Lee-Ditko stories, Spider-Man {{has the ability}} to cling to walls, superhuman strength, a sixth sense ("spider-sense") that alerts him to danger, perfect balance and equilibrium, as well as superhuman speed and agility. [...] The character was originally conceived by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko as <b>intellectually</b> <b>gifted,</b> but later writers have depicted his intellect at genius level. Academically brilliant, Parker has expertise in the fields of applied science, chemistry, physics, biology, engineering, mathematics, and mechanics. With his talents, he sews his own costume to conceal his identity, and he constructs many devices that complement his powers, most notably mechanical web-shooters. This mechanism ejects an advanced adhesive, releasing web-fluid in a variety of configurations, including a single rope-like strand to swing from, a net to snare or bind enemies, and a simple glob to foul machinery or blind an opponent. He can also weave the web material into simple forms like a shield, a spherical protection or hemispherical barrier, a club, or a hang-glider wing. Other equipment include a light beacon that can either be used as a flashlight or project a [...] "Spider-Signal" [...] design, a specially modified camera that can take pictures automatically, and spider-tracers, which are spider-shaped adhesive homing beacons keyed to his own spider-sense.|$|E
50|$|The PPVT-IV {{provides}} {{an estimate of}} the client's verbal intelligence and has been administered to groups who had reading or speech problems, had intellectual disability, or were emotionally withdrawn. Studies of earlier versions of the test suggested that it tended to underestimate full-scale IQ scores for both <b>intellectually</b> disabled and <b>gifted</b> test-takers. Because the manner of the individual's response to stimulus vocabulary is to point in any fashion to one of four pictures that best fits the stimulus work, these tests also apply to rehabilitation of individuals who have multiple physical impairments, but whose hearing and vision are intact. The PPVT-IV can also be used for assessing the English vocabulary of non-English-speaking individuals and assessing adult verbal ability.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of an accurate assessment paradigm that identifies students as capable of high performance {{in a variety of}} areas is urgently needed in education. Current strategies tend to identify only those students who are <b>intellectually</b> or academically <b>gifted.</b> Gifted students who possess other strengths or pupils who exhibit atypical behavior are often overlooked or misidentified in the process. A few educational theorists/practitioners, believe that current practice should be supplemented by some of the testing protocols typically associated with the field of neuropsychophysiology (i. e. neurology, psychology, physiology). This study develops a neuropsychophysiological paradigm that differentiates high average, gifted, and gifted students with perceived behavior problems. Sixty-six students, 10 [...] 12 years of age, participated in the study. After being screened for incidents of psychopathology, each student completed 14 timed/untimed relaxation and performance conditions while being monitored by EEG and biofeedback technology. The data were analysed quantitatively using three non-parametric tests. The results of the data analysis suggest that high average, gifted, and gifted students with perceived behavior problems can be differentiated using a neuropsychophysiological paradigm. Foremost in the conclusions is the suggestion that gifted students may excel in two domains intellectual and psychophysiological, and that gifted students with perceived behavior problems may be a legitimate subgroup of the larger population...|$|R

In 1987/1988 he tested 7000 third graders on a test based on the German version of the Cattell Culture Fair III test. Those who scored at least two standard deviations above the mean were categorised as gifted. A total of 151 gifted subjects {{participated in the study}} alongside 136 controls. [...] All participants in the study were tested blind with the result that they did not discover whether they were gifted or not. The study revealed that the gifted children did very well in school. The vast majority later attended a Gymnasium and achieved good grades. However, 15 percent, were classified as underachievers because they attended a Realschule (two cases) or a Hauptschule (one case), had repeated a grade (four cases) or had grades that put them in the lower half of their class (the rest of cases). The report also concluded that most gifted persons had high self-esteem and good psychological health. Rost said that he was not in favour of special schools for the gifted.
