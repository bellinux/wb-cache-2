The FMH is formed on the following parameter space: agents' <b>investment</b> <b>horizons.</b> A financial market is more stable when a fractal character in the structures of agent's <b>investment</b> <b>horizons</b> is adopted. For computer simulations, the classical model is modified. This adjusted model shows that various frequency distributions on agents' <b>investment</b> <b>horizons</b> lead to different returns behaviour. The FMH focuses on matching of demand and supply of agents' <b>investment</b> <b>horizons</b> in the financial market. The FMH asserts that investors have different information based on temporal attributes.

The decomposition of volatility into several <b>investment</b> <b>horizons</b> and jumps is possible due to a recently proposed jump wavelet two scale realized volatility estimator (JWTSRV). On exchange rate futures data covering the recent financial crisis, we moreover compare forecasts using sev-eral additional realized volatility measures. Our results show that inclusion of jumps and realized measures robust to noise improves forecasting ability of the model considerably. Thus for a forecaster, {{it is crucial to}} use proper high frequency measure. An interesting insight into the volatility process is also provided by its decomposition.

Numerical simulations reveal that under taxation traders abstain from short-term trading in favour of longer <b>investment</b> <b>horizons.</b> This change in behavior leads to less excess volatility and diminishing volatility clusters for small tax rates. When the tax rate exceeds a certain threshold, excess volatility and misalignments increase as also found in Westerhoff (Heterogeneous Traders and the Tobin Tax).

40|$|Purpose of the article: The {{focus of}} this article are lump sum and regular {{investments}} on selected world stock markets in the period from 1990 to 2010 for different <b>investment</b> <b>horizons.</b> Methodology/methods: The Methodology used in this Paper is based on the quantification of return and risk indicators for different <b>investment</b> <b>horizons.</b> As these horizonts were chosen: 1 year, 3 years, 5 years and 10 years. All Indices are used in total return form, i. e. dividends and their reinvesting on the same market are included. Standard deviation is used as the risk indicator and internal rate of return is used as the return indicator. Scientific aim: The aim of this Paper is to compare and evaluate lump sum and regular investments on world stock markets according to the return-risk profile in the period from 1990 to 2010 for different <b>investment</b> <b>horizons.</b> The following world stock markets were chosen: US stock market (S&P 500 Total Return index), European stock market (S&P Europe 350 Total Return index) and Japan stock market (S&P TOPIX 150 Total Return index). Findings: Lump sum investments brought better (higher) values of the return-risk profile than regular investment through the value averaging method made during the same period on the same market, mostly over long term <b>investment</b> <b>horizons.</b> Over shorter <b>investment</b> <b>horizons,</b> lump sum was still bringing better results, but risk was always higher than the return [...] Conclusions: As this Paper has shown, even when the results of the return-risk profile of regular investment with value averaging method were not better than for lump sum investment strategy, investments with this method can be still clearly recommended as a method reducing the timing risk for long-term growing stock markets...|$|R

Using smooth wavelets and Maximum Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform, we {{allow for the}} decomposition of the realized variance into several <b>investment</b> <b>horizons</b> and jumps.

The results reveal that our wavelet-based estimator is able to estimate and forecast the realized measures with the greatest precision.
