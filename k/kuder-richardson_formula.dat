40|$|The TaalVaST {{language}} test, {{developed at}} the Leuven Language Institute (University of Leuven) has been taken by more than 9000 first year students since September 2010. Its growing popularity shows that a well constructed and piloted language test can replace other screening methods that take {{up a lot of}} time and resources. The test has proved to be an efficient tool to, on the one hand, give students an early ‘warning signal’ during their academic education and on the other hand function as a starting point for language tutoring tailored to the needs of a defined target audience. The construct of the language test has been proved to be statistically valid and reliable. A pilot version of the test was used to determine the construct validity and reliability by means of the simple-item discrimination method, the calculation of the point-biserial correlation coefficient, item facility and the <b>Kuder-Richardson</b> 20 <b>formula.</b> By analyzing students’ secondary education and language use at home the group-differential validity of the test has been determined. Moreover, a study by Huyghe and Marx (2011) found a significant correlation between the language test scores and students’ academic success. That confirms other important studies in the field of language testing (Van Dyk 2010, McNamara 1996) and proves the concurrent validity of the test (Davies 1990, 23 - 24). Constructing the test, we deliberately did not start from the CEFR, but used a needs analysis as a basis for the construction of our test items. Essentially, the reading and writing requirements for first year university students were taken as a basis for the items and were only incorporated into the language test after they had proven to be valid.

METHODS The instrument was adapted and validated in a sample of 151 older adults from a geriatric reference center in the municipality of Belo Horizonte, State of Minas Gerais, in 2014. We collected sociodemographic, clinical, and abuse-related information, and verified reliability by reproducibility in a sample of 55 older people, who underwent re-testing of the instrument seven days after the first application. Descriptive and comparative analyses were performed for all variables, with a significance level of 5 %. The construct validity was analyzed by the principal components method with a tetrachoric correlation matrix, the reliability of the scale by the weighted Kappa (Kp) statistic, and the internal consistency by the <b>Kuder-Richardson</b> estimator <b>formula</b> 20 (KR- 20). RESULTS The average age of the participants was 72. 1 years (DP = 6. 96; 95 %CI 70. 94 – 73. 17), with a maximum of 92 years, and they were predominantly female (76. 2 %; 95 %CI 69. 82 – 83. 03). When analyzing the relationship between the scores of the Vulnerability to Abuse Screening Scale, categorized by presence (score > 3) or absence (score < 3) of vulnerability to abuse, with clinical and health conditions, we found statistically significant differences for self-perception of health (p = 0. 002), depressive symptoms (p = 0. 000), and presence of rheumatism (p = 0. 003). There were no statistically significant differences between sexes. The Vulnerability to Abuse Screening Scale acceptably evaluated validity in the transcultural adaptation process, demonstrating dimensionality coherent with the original proposal (four factors). In the internal consistency analysis, the instrument presented good results (KR- 20 = 0. 69) and the reliability via reproducibility was considered excellent for the global scale (Kp = 0. 92).

40|$|TRADITIONALLY, the {{reliability}} of a test {{is defined as the}} ratio of the variance of true test scores to the variance of the observed test scores. Numerous articles have been written on the concept of reliability and the ways of estimation. The three typical techniques of estimation are (1) the <b>Kuder-Richardson</b> <b>formula</b> 20 (Kuder and Richardson, 1937), (2) the Hoyt analysis of variance method (Hoyt, 1941), and (3) the Rulon split half method (Rulon, 1939). It has been shown that the <b>Kuder-Richardson</b> <b>formula</b> 20 and Hoyt’s method are algebraic equivalents. The reliabilities of many tests have been computed by these methods since their introduction some 30 years ago.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to develop a model for {{articulating}} selected courses between a two year vocational technical college and a four year academic university. More specifically, the study tested the feasibility of the use of locally developed competency instruments as a vehicle for administrative decisions about inter-institutional course articulation. One instructor in the electricity/electronics departments at Ball State University (BSU) and one at Indiana Vocational Technical College - Region 6 (IVTC) were asked to construct a competency based examination. Subject matter for the examination was identified as material taught at both institutions in an introductory course. An examination was developed using the format of domain-referenced instrument construction. A competency test was developed by defining tasks, and cognitive and psychomotor variables that a student must demcnstrate to perform the stated tasks. Students enrolled in the introductory electricity/ electronics course at each institution during spring quarter 1978 were asked to take the written examination. Thirty-eight students from Ball State University and forty-three from Indiana Vocational Technical College volunteered to participate. Six of the volunteers from each institution agreed to take the practical portion of the examination. The examinations were administered by the respective instructor. Answer sheets and rating sheets were coded to insure student anonymity. Tables were developed to show rank-order and frequency distribution of scores as well as the mean scores of all students by each institution. An item analysis was conducted and <b>Kuder-Richardson</b> <b>Formula</b> 20 was used to measure reliability. Scores were analyzed by: 1) cognitive and psychomotor competency on each task, 2) cognitive competency on each task, 3) psychomotor competency on each task, 4) cognitive competency on all tasks, 5) psychomotor competency on all tasks, and 6) cognitive and psychomotor competencies on all tasks. Reliability of the 92 item written examination was 0. 9234 using <b>Kuder-Richardson</b> <b>Formula</b> 20. Approximately 70 percent of the students from IVTC scored higher than all students from BSU on the written examination. The mean score on the written examination for students from IVTC was 66. 0, or 22. 1 points higher than the mean score of 43. 9 for students willing to participate in the practical as well as the written examination. The sum of the mean scores for students from IVTC was 78. 5 as compared to 55. 2 for students from BSU. Data were analyzed and the fo 1 lowing three conclusions were drawn:The data provided by the Kuder-Richardson estimate of reliability indicated that instructors from a separate college and university can jointly develop reliable competency measurement instruments. Locally developed reliable competency measurement instruments provide administrators with data regarding compatibility and incompatibility of selected courses with which administrators can feasibly make objective decisions about inter-institutional course articulation. Data from reliable competency measurement instruments provide administrators more quantifiable information than presently exists in college catalog descriptions, course objectives and oral descriptions of courses for making a more specific decision on course articulation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: High {{concomitant}} intolerance {{attributed to}} odorous/pungent chemicals, certain buildings, electromagnetic fields (EMF), and everyday sounds {{calls for a}} questionnaire instrument that can assess symptom prevalence in various environmental intolerances. The Environmental Hypersensitivity Symptom Inventory (EHSI) was therefore developed and metrically evaluated, and normative data were established. The EHSI consists of 34 symptom items, requires limited time to respond to, and provides a detailed and broad description of the individual's symptomology. METHODS: Data from 3406 individuals {{who took part in}} the Vasterbotten Environmental Health Study were used. The participants constitute a random sample of inhabitants in the county of Vasterbotten in Sweden, aged 18 to 79 years, stratified for age and gender. RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis identified five significant factors: airway symptoms (9 items; <b>Kuder-Richardson</b> <b>Formula</b> 20 coefficient, KR- 20, of internal consistency = 0. 74), skin and eye symptoms (6 items; KR- 20 = 0. 60), cardiac, dizziness and nausea symptoms (4 items; KR- 20 = 0. 55), head-related and gastrointestinal symptoms (5 items; KR- 20 = 0. 55), and cognitive and affective symptoms (10 items; KR- 20 = 0. 80). The KR- 20 was 0. 85 for the entire 34 -item EHSI. Symptom prevalence rates in percentage for having the specific symptoms every week over the preceding three months constitute normative data. CONCLUSIONS: The EHSI can be recommended for assessment of symptom prevalence in various types of environmental hypersensitivity, and with the advantage of comparing prevalence rates with normality...|$|E

The significance {{of this study was}} that it would stimulate creativity, discovery and enquiry oriented in students since {{at the end of each}} lesson, the student may fashion their notes according to their ability to facilitate their retention The study was carried out in two selected co-educational schools in Aguata Local government Area of Anambra State, South East of Nigeria. A sample size of 195 Senior Secondary school students two was used for the study. The two selected schools were assumed to possess similar characteristics. A pretest post-test non-equivalent control group design was adopted for the study. The treatments were assigned to the two coeducational schools respectively. Economics achievement test was used as an instrument for data collection. The instrument was validated and trial-tested and the responses from this exercise were used to determine the internal consistency of the items of the instrument using <b>Kuder-Richardson</b> <b>formula</b> 20. The reliability was found to be 0. 79. The two groups (experimental and control groups) were pre-tested before the treatment. After the treatment, the posttest was administered to the two groups.

40|$|Background : Violation of item-writing {{guidelines}} {{is still}} frequently encountered in assessments in medical colleges. Flawed multiple-choice (MC) items affect students′ performance and distort examinations′ results. Aims: The {{aim was to}} assess the frequency and impact of flawed MC items on students′ achievement in our setting. Settings and Design: This is a quantitative descriptive study conducted at the Faculty of Medicine in the University of Tabuk, Saudi Arabia. Methods: We evaluated a 100 single-correct answer MC questions summative surgical examination administered to 44 6 th year final medical students in November 2014. MC items, which contain one or more violation of item-writing guidelines, were classified as flawed, those with no violation, were classified as standard. The passing rates and median scores of high- and low-achieving students were calculated on both standard and flawed test scales. Item performance parameters (difficulty index, discrimination power and internal consistency reliability (<b>Kuder-Richardson</b> <b>formula</b> 20) were calculated for standard and flawed items. Descriptive and comparative statistics with the relevant tests of significance were performed using the  SPSS (IBM SPSS Inc. Chicago, Illinois) computer software version 16. Results: Thirty-nine flawed items were identified (39 %) which contain 49 violations of the item-writing guidelines. The passing rate was 93. 2 % and 91. 8 % on the total and standard scales, respectively. Flawed items benefited low-achieving students and disadvantaged the high-achieving students. Overall, flawed items were less difficult, less discriminating and less reliable than standard items. Conclusions: The frequency of flawed items in our examination was high and reflects the need for more training and faculty development programmes...|$|E
