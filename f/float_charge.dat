5000|$|The {{underlying}} {{fault with}} all {{lead acid batteries}} is the requirement for an excessively long charge time arising from a two-stage process: bulk charge and <b>float</b> <b>charge.</b> All lead acid batteries, irrespective of type, are quick to charge to 70% of capacity within 2 or 3 hours, but require another 9 to 10 hours to [...] "float charge" [...] after the initial charge. If users fail to <b>float</b> <b>charge,</b> battery capacity is dramatically reduced. All types of batteries have a [...] "memory" [...] in that every time a user charges to less than 100% charge, battery capacity is shortened. A lead acid battery could reach 4,600 cycles if it were kept on a shelf and kept at the right state of charge. To ensure a life of 8 years, a lead acid battery should be kept at full charge when stored (or dry), and, when working, kept at depth of discharge of less than 20%. In addition, its discharge rate should be not {{more than three hours}} and its charge rate should be not more than three hours (C0.333), and it should be float charged properly. With less careful use, a lifetime of two to three years or 700-800 cycles might be expected, dependent upon the use environment.|$|E

50|$|Batteries {{gradually}} self-discharge even if {{not connected}} and delivering current. Li+ rechargeable batteries have a self-discharge rate typically stated by manufacturers to be 1.5-2% per month. The rate increases with temperature and state of charge. A 2004 study found that for most cycling conditions self-discharge was primarily time-dependent; however, after several months of stand on open circuit or <b>float</b> <b>charge,</b> state-of-charge dependent losses became significant. The self-discharge rate did not increase monotonically with state-of-charge, but dropped somewhat at intermediate states of charge. Self-discharge rates may increase as batteries age.|$|E

50|$|With the {{exception}} of the PRC 349 and UK RT 350 which are 12 Volt (nominal), The Manpack and Portable sets and their chargers were almost all nominally rated 24V DC (Direct Current) to match the British Army's choice of 24 Volts to power its vehicle systems. The Direct Current Charging Units (DCCU) was used to <b>float</b> <b>charge</b> (provide a top up charge while the set was in use) the manpack battery, while it was mounted in a vehicle, using a clip in kit for example. It could also provide a full charge cycle over 4.5 Hours from flat, switching itself out of circuit when complete. (A clip-in kit locked the radio in a convenient frame for rapid deployment when dismounting, and had the charger as part of the installation.) There were a few exceptions where 24 Volts was not used in vehicles, such as in the General Service (GS) Landrover where a 12v system was used for example. A 12 Volt DCCU was provided. The Clansman 24V 4Ah Nickel Cadmium Battery was prolific and for convenience an Alternating Current Charging Unit (ACCU) was provided for use in barracks where up to sixteen batteries could be charged simultaneously or singularly. All of these chargers worked the same, basically providing an appropriate charging current while sensing the battery temperature to detect when charging was complete, achieved by measuring the voltage across two sets of a series pair of silicon diodes in the battery itself, one series pair would sense the internal temperature of the cells the other series pair fitted close to the outer case of the battery to sense ambient temperature, the difference in temperature being used to determine the state of charge. One drawback of the Clansman 24V 4Ah NICAD is that failure of these diodes makes batteries unserviceable. Also due to partial charge cycles due to the 'memory effect' of the Nicad cells. A discharge process could have prevented such failures, but was not provided for in either the DC or ACCU. Specialists can rebuild the unserviceable Clansman NICAD battery.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} <b>float</b> <b>charge</b> {{operation}} of Valve Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA) batteries in standby power applications. While the telecommunication standby power {{system is the}} targeted application, the results are applicable in any situation where VRLA batteries are subjected to long periods of <b>float</b> <b>charge.</b> The goals of <b>float</b> <b>charge</b> are identified and a test and analysis procedure is developed to provide a means of assessing {{the effectiveness of the}} applied <b>float</b> <b>charge.</b> The primary goal of <b>float</b> <b>charge</b> is to counteract the natural self-discharge of the battery and indefinitely maintain it in a fully charged state. A secondary goal of <b>float</b> <b>charge</b> is to maximise the life of the battery. This is achieved by ensuring that ageing mechanisms such as positive grid corrosion and gas venting are maintained at minimum levels. The problems associated with conventional <b>float</b> <b>charge</b> control are investigated and, in particular, the electrode imbalance problems associated with some long life VRLA cells are detailed. These electrode imbalance problems can result in the cell suffering a gradual discharge of the negative electrode while the cell appears healthy and on a <b>float</b> <b>charge.</b> This ultimately results in reduced cell capacity and is identified as a major cause of the premature failure of long life VRLA cells. <b>Float</b> <b>charge</b> analysis and the subsequent optimisation relies heavily on knowledge of the polarisation distribution between the positive and negative electrodes within a cell. Conventionally, this is determined {{with the aid of a}} reference electrode, although such testing is only possible in a well-controlled laboratory environment. By modelling the steady state and transient features of both the positive and negative electrodes, a test and analysis procedure is developed to estimate the polarisation distribution within a conventional 2 V VRLA cell, in effect creating a virtual reference electrode. The developed procedure exploits differences in the transient response of each electrode to estimate their polarisations at the applied float voltage. The polarisation estimations are typically accurate to within 10 mV, the window of polarisation relating to minimal positive grid corrosion is approximately 40 mV wide, and the total polarisation applied to a VRLA cell is around 130 mV. The test requires only a very low rate constant current discharge, and cell terminal voltage measurements. This test may be automated and applied to cells in field service, and provides the necessary measure to gauge <b>float</b> <b>charge</b> optimisation. The developed test is able to verify that a cell on <b>float</b> <b>charge</b> is indeed fully charged, and assists in determining the optimal float voltage for maximum cell life...|$|E

2500|$|A stricter regime {{exists for}} <b>floating</b> <b>charges</b> under IA 1986 section 245 that could {{prejudice}} other creditors in the {{run up to}} insolvency. Any <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> created up to one year {{before the onset of}} insolvency is avoidable at the company's instance if new money was not advanced to the company in return. So a company cannot grant a <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> to a creditor to secure past advances made by that creditor, unless given at least [...] "at the same time". In Re Shoe Lace Ltd Hoffmann J held that £350,000 advanced in April and May was not close enough to a <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> created in July to be considered [...] "at the same time". The <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> could not secure those amounts. Because the context of the legislation was a business one, and {{in view of the fact}} that <b>floating</b> <b>charges</b> can be registered up to 21 days after their creation, a few months was far too long. Second 245 only rescinds the charge, and not the debt itself, which remains in effect as before. Yet the creditor becomes unsecured and ranks alongside other creditors. Banks operating accounts for companies in overdraft have an advantage in this respect. Re Yeovil Glove Co Ltd held that if the overall level of debt remains the same, before and after a <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> is created, and if money turns over by payments of the company in and withdrawals out, the bank's continued extension of credit will continually [...] "harden" [...] their <b>floating</b> <b>charge.</b> Although Yeovil Glove Co LTd was always indebted to the bank before a <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> was created, and was indebted at the point of insolvency, because it had deposited and withdrawn a greater amount, the bank's <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> was considered secure. Finally, Companies Act 2006, section 874 stipulates that any <b>charge,</b> including a <b>floating</b> <b>charge,</b> that is not registered is considered void. This simple provision encourages a transparency of security interests, at least if creditors are in a position to check the register.|$|R
40|$|A {{rechargeable}} hybrid aqueous battery (ReHAB) {{system has}} recently been developed by our research group. In order to improve the anode material, electrowinning technique has been introduced to produce four different types of Zn anodes with various combinations of additives Bi, In, thiourea and gelatin (labeled as BG# 1, TG# 1, ITG# 1 and hBITG# 1). The resulting Zn anodes have been fully characterized for their electrochemical and battery performance. The results have been compared with commercial Zn. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern results indicate that during the electrowinning Zn has been deposited preferably along certain crystal directions. From scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images on relatively low magnification, commercial Zn foil shows cutting marks which might be caused by the cutting process with the manufacturer. While all anodes prepared by the electrowinning show relatively uniform surfaces. On relatively higher magnifications, the morphology of BG# 1 is flat hexagonal & non-porous, TG# 1 is fine-grained & porous, ITG# 1 has relatively medium grain size & porous, and hBITG# 1 is coarse-grained & porous. All anodes exhibit similar corrosion potentials and TG# 1 performs the lowest corrosion current at 723. 824 µA (per 1. 1 cm 2), follow by ITG# 1, commercial Zn, BG# 1 and hBITG# 1. It means that the anode TG# 1 possesses the best corrosion resistance. After 200 cycles for CC-CV protocol, batteries using commercial Zn anodes had capacity retention of 78. 2 %, yet batteries with BG# 1, TG# 1, ITG# 1 and hBITG# 1 anodes had 82. 6 %, 84. 3 %, 75. 0 %, and 71. 9 % capacity retention, respectively. While after 300 cycles, batteries with BG# 1, TG# 1, ITG# 1 and hBITG# 1 anodes had 73. 2 %, 77. 2 %, 66. 2 %, and 59. 8 % capacity retention respectively, yet batteries using commercial Zn anodes were all dead between 220 - 270 cycles. The {{results indicate that the}} TG# 1 is the best choice for preparing anode material for the ReHAB. And all electrowinning Zn anodes are relatively stable compare to commercial Zn. The polarization resistances of batteries measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for all kinds of Zn anodes after cycles didn’t have exactly the same trend. The battery with the BG# 1 anode has smallest polarization resistance which means it consumes the minimum energy during charge-discharge process, followed by the hBITG# 1, the commercial Zn, the ITG# 1 and the TG# 1. At room temperature (25 ℃), <b>float</b> <b>charge</b> current of commercial Zn and hBITG# 1 at 2. 1 V have largest values meaning more side reactions happening in the batteries, followed by TG# 1, BG# 1 and ITG# 1. At high temperature (60 ℃), the trend was the same. Elemental analysis results indicate that batteries with BG# 1 anode has the most carbon on cathode material after both room temperature <b>float</b> <b>charge</b> (RTFC) and high temperature <b>float</b> <b>charge</b> (HTFC) tests. This suggests those with BG# 1 anode are the most stable on cathode material with least structure collapse during <b>float</b> <b>charge</b> processes, followed by hBITG# 1, TG# 1, ITG# 1 and commercial Zn. Both BG# 1 and TG# 1 anodes show good overall performance. The advantages on battery performance of BG# 1 anodes could be attributed to the uniform deposits, preferable crystal orientations and high corrosion resistance, and which of TG# 1 anodes could be attributed to the porous and fine-grained deposits, preferable crystal orientations and high corrosion resistance. 4 month...|$|E
