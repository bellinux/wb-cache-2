40|$|Sustainable {{development}} includes environmental, {{social and}} economic dimension, which has become an accepted concept {{at all levels of}} society. There is also a need for these dimensions to integrate with each other. To attain a sustainable development it has {{to be seen as a}} whole. The <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives</b> were established by Swedish parliament in 1999; however these objectives are only one of the steps in achieving a sustainable society. Swedish municipality are forced to use the <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives</b> for guidance in planning society. Municipalities have a responsibility to integrate environmental issues into political processes and at the same time contribute to an increase of the awareness about these issues. There is no guidance in the work with the <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives</b> and municipality have to work on the basis of their own environment and conditions. The aim of this essay was to study the work of implementing <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives</b> in one municipality, with the focus on the objectives four and fifteen; towards an ecological sustainable development with support of the environmental work of another municipality. The focus of the work lays on the formulation of <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives</b> four and fifteen in order for them to be achieved without difficulty. One conclusion is that none of the chosen <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives</b> are reached. The theoretical discussion highlights the importance of a communicative work between different participants and also information about the environmental issues on the individual level.        This work was considered to contribute to future research concerning municipalities work with <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives.</b> ...|$|R

How the Swedish consumption pressures the global environment and methods to measure the affects was investigated. The pressure was divided into five main fields: climate, air, water, land and chemicals. The impacton humans and the biodiversity was also discussed, as well as differences between how men and women affect the environment and get affected when the environment changes. Chosen methods for calculating the impact {{had to be able}} to measure the pressure the Swedish consumption has on the environment, and thus humans and the biodiversity. The results show that the Swedish consumption has large internal and external impact on the environment. The methods that met the reports criteria and were analyzed were environmental input-output analysis, ecological footprint, water footprint, carbon footprint and environmental space. An earlier proposal for a seventeenth <b>environmental</b> <b>objective</b> was reviewed, called Restricted environmental pressure in other countries. In the discussion anew <b>environmental</b> <b>objective</b> was presented together with six stage goals. They were based o nthe main fields of environmental pressure. The measuring methods that were suitable and complete were suggested as indicators, namely ecological footprint and carbon footprint. To integrate the global aspect of the Swedish consumption with the environmental politics it’spossible to introduce a new <b>environmental</b> <b>objective.</b> Sustainable consumption is an attempt to do that...|$|R

Observations were grouped according to groups of eco-district areas. The observed concentrations were compared with <b>environmental</b> quality <b>objectives</b> for groundwater. The percentage of the surface with groundwater at concentrations <b>exceeding</b> the <b>environmental</b> quality <b>objectives</b> (%OBS) was calculated and depicted in maps for 2000. Maps showing the change in %OBS in the 1984 - 2000 period are also presented. In the sandy and loess areas, high OBS percentages (at least > 10 %) are shown for nitrate, potassium and aluminium that are {{the effect of a}} combination of over-fertilisation, acidification and aggravation of drought. The effects highly resemble each other and are therefore not discernible. The %OBS that is observed in the shallow groundwater is often found to be higher than the %OBS in the medium-deep groundwater. Specifically, increased concentrations for cadmium, nickel and zinc occurs in the sandy area of the southern Netherlands. It is most plausible that the elevated concentrations represents the effect of a combination of over-fertilisation, acidification, aggravation of drought and the properties of the subsoil (poor, pyrite-containing), and not the effect of transport due to the burdening of the subsoil (caused by direct burdening with trace elements from the metal industry or fertiliser/manure). In clay and peat areas, high %OBS's are found for chloride, sulphate, ammonium, phosphate and potassium as a result of marine deposits. Often the %OBS observed in medium-deep groundwater are higher than in shallow groundwater. The %OBS for arsenic is inherently high in the marine clay and peat areas. In general, the groundwater quality did not change much in the 1984 - 2000 period. Only the concentration of chloride shows a decrease. This corresponds with the observed decrease in the chloride load on the soil in the Netherlands...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{motivated}} by the outlook of climate changes, expectations of more stormwater in the future, and {{the potential impact of}} stormwater on receiving waters. The study set out to investigate how Danish municipalities balance stormwater management with <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives</b> as set out by the WFD and national law. The general aim was to understand if the current stormwater management practice could impede compliance with <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives.</b> After an outline of the legal frames for the practice, an interview study about the practice, with seven municipal water managers from four different municipalities, who process discharge permits, was carried out. The qualitative data was analysed through a practice theoretical perspective {{in order to understand the}} water managers’ way of reasoning and how they balance the need of stormwater discharge with <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives.</b> Some of the main impediments to compliance with <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives</b> were found to be lack of environmental data on receiving waters and a lack of knowledge about the pollution profile of stormwater. These two elements have created a practice where a low-tech treatment/delay facility is required in permits but no further consistent monitoring of the discharge is carried out. However, uncertainties remain about the efficiency of available technology and whether the use of the technologies perceived as Best Available Technology (BAT) is sufficient to comply with <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives...</b>|$|R

We present a methodology that addresses this need via the use of expert knowledge.

We used stakeholder consultations to weight the relative importance of the different <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives.</b> Multi-criteria analysis (MCA) techniques were used to produce an aggregated judgement of environmental effectiveness for single case studies or measures.

Assessments are often undertaken via indicators which measure progress towards <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives</b> and interim targets. This paper starts from the assumption that different types of environmental indicators have different implications for the public communication and the societal dialogue about the state of the environment and the measures needed to increase ecological sustainability. The paper concludes that it is important to evaluate environmental indicators on the basis of their communicative potential. It is demonstrated how science-based assessment of progress towards <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives</b> may fulfil different aims. Each of these aims may be linked to particular types of indicators, as well as to particular ideas of how to communicate uncertainties, and to particular views of the role of the public in the system of <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to examine}} why smaller municipalities[1] in Sweden experience difficulties when implementing the 16 <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives</b> {{that are designed to}} solve Sweden's environmental problems. The theoretical framework used for this dissertation is implementation theory which provides three conditions that need to be met {{in order to have a}} successful implementation.   These three conditions have shaped the research questions that examine if Torsby municipality has the "understanding," "ability" and "will" needed to implement the decision correctly.    The dissertation employs a case study method to examine why Torsby municipality has experienced difficulties implementating the target: programmes and strategies for planning, which is an interim target to <b>environmental</b> <b>objective</b> number 15 : A good built environment.   Qualitative text analysis and interviews with politicians and civil servants from Torsby municipality and the county administration board of Värmland have been conducted in order to answer the research questions.     The material used for this dissertation is mostly from the government bills that are the foundation of the Swedish environmental policy and the documents and reports about the <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives</b> that the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning (Boverket), the Swedish Environmental protection agency (Naturvårdsverket), and the <b>Environmental</b> <b>objectives</b> council (Miljörådet) have released. The result of this dissertation supports previous research which has shown that smaller municipalities have problems implementating the <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives</b> due to a lack of financial resources. This dissertation also shows that the problems can be due to a lack of understanding the purpose of the objectives.   This leads to a lack of political will to implement the objectives.   Since the municipalities do not have the political will to implement the objectives the appropriate resources needed for a successful implementation are not appointed and therefore the municipalities are not able to fully implement the <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives.</b>   [1] Municipalities with less than 20   000 inhabitants...|$|R

In addition to a number of interviews with people within the academy and government, a document analysis of detailed development plans has been done. As of today, you can not completely do planning based entirely on the <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives</b> and it is perhaps not desirable. In the study it emerges that there are uncertainties in what the <b>environmental</b> quality <b>objectives</b> really are and how they should be used, therefore, is also the implementation of the objectives to some extent different in the detailed development plans (if they are used at all). Within the <b>environmental</b> <b>objective</b> ‘a good built environment’ and its sub-goals one can find both concrete and more unsolid goals, as part of this, goal conflicts arise and problems with implementing the various goals within detailed development plans. Some conclusions are that short-term economic goals stands in the way for a change in perspectives that is needed, if goal achievement should be reached. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the long and complex process of {{integrating}} <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives</b> into the agricultural policy of the EU. The greening process was reinforced with the Cap reform in Agenda 2000, and especially with inclusion of agri-environmental measures in rural development plans {{and the introduction of}} horizontal regulation. The process has gained momentum on the strength of two sets of factors: i) the issue of potential health hazards in food; ii) the Agenda 2000 mid-term review. Altogether, the integration of <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives</b> with agricultural and rural development policies has been partial and incomplete so far, mainly because it is based on conditionality to sector-based tools with different goals. It would therefore be more effective to focus on specific <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives</b> and reinforce territory-based instruments, especially those already available in the EU policy tool set but currently subordinated to market and sector-based policies.
