50|$|Around 1980 (in the UK, at least), {{some new}} {{fluorescent}} fittings {{were designed to}} take only the newer, retrofit tubes (the <b>lamp</b> <b>holders</b> are designed not to take T12 tubes, except for 8 ft length). The earlier T12 halophosphate tubes still remained available as spares until 2012. They fit in older fittings and some modern fittings that employ twist lock <b>lamp</b> <b>holders,</b> even though the modern fittings were not electrically designed for them.|$|R
50|$|After obtaining {{an honorable}} {{discharge}} {{he went to}} work at the <b>Edison</b> <b>Lamp</b> Works in Harrison with his father and brothers as a glassblower. Around 1890 he moved to the Edison Laboratory in West Orange to assist in experiments with the incandescent lamp.|$|R
50|$|In 1924 Howell was a {{recipient}} of the IEEE Edison Medal for his contributions towards {{the development of the}} incandescent lamp. Howell later co-authored the book History of the Incandescent Lamp, the authoritative source for the identification and description of <b>Edison</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s Jones crafted his award-winning <b>Edison</b> <b>Lamp.</b> Using {{original}} Thomas Edison light bulbs, Jones {{created a}} lamp with steel and lucite {{to show the}} inner workings of Edison's original technology. It won him the California Design 11 Competition and special recognition from the German government.|$|R
50|$|The town's {{proximity}} to rail lines {{and a large}} waterfront made Harrison favorably situated for trade. Some of the industries which called Harrison home included the <b>Edison</b> <b>Lamp</b> Works, Worthington Pump and Machinery, the RCA Company, the Peter Hauck Brewery, Driver-Harris Company, Crucible Steel Company, Otis Elevator, Hartz Mountain, Remco Industries, Nopco Chemical and Hyatt Roller Bearing.|$|R
50|$|Some {{adapters}} {{for wall}} outlets use an Edison screw, allowing a light socket {{to become an}} ungrounded electrical outlet (such as to install Christmas lights temporarily via a porch light), or to make a pull-chain switch with two outlets, or to split it for two lamps. Another adapter can make a wall outlet into a <b>lamp</b> <b>holder</b> (<b>lamp</b> socket).|$|R

However, due to Arthur Holly Compton, a physics faculty member and later Chancellor, Eckart was influenced to continue his education in physics at Princeton, where he went in 1923 on an <b>Edison</b> <b>Lamp</b> Works Research Fellowship. Eckart was awarded his Ph.D. in 1925.|$|R
50|$|In 1911 GE {{was found}} to have {{acquired}} three quarters of the National Electric Light Association, an association of lighting product companies through which GE had licensed its patented products; this trading arrangement was the subject of an antitrust investigation, and as a result the association was dissolved. GE subsequently acquired several of the association's member companies. These were later consolidated with the <b>Edison</b> <b>lamp</b> division.|$|R
50|$|Many of Thomas Edison's {{companies}} had display booths at the exhibition. The Edison Electric Light Company showed in operation their system of house lighting as supplied from a central station. The Edison Company for Isolated Lighting exhibited their system of lighting factories, hotels, hospitals, {{and other places}} situated {{beyond the reach of}} a central lighting station. A full assortment of <b>Edison</b> <b>lamps</b> and dynamos also made up parts of other exhibits.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of its completion, the Exchange Building was the second-tallest {{reinforced}} concrete skyscraper in the United States. In addition to many of Seattle’s commodity market exchanges, early tenants included General Electric, Standard Oil, <b>Edison</b> <b>Lamp</b> Works, and Underwriters Laboratories. Later tenants included Pacific Northwest Bell and King County Metro (formally Seattle Metro). As of 2016 major tenants include the Slalom Consulting, Deloitte Digital, and Nuance Communications.|$|R

[...] Loosening this wing nut will free the lamp assembly from the cap housing. [...] The user can then push the entire adjustment screw and <b>lamp</b> <b>holder</b> up, down, left or right to center the hot spot in the beam. [...] It is this adjustment that most commonly needs to be made with lights that haven't been regularly serviced. [...] Sometimes it is helpful to use a screwdriver or wrench or other thin tool to reach between the body of the light and the cap to push up on the <b>lamp</b> <b>holder</b> assembly and hold it in place while you tighten the wing nut back down.|$|R
50|$|Diehl's {{invention}} of the induction lamp was used by George Westinghouse to force royalty concessions from Thomas Edison. The Westinghouse Company bought Diehl's patent rights for $25,000. Although Diehl's lamp could not be made and sold at a price {{to compete with the}} <b>Edison</b> <b>lamp,</b> the Westinghouse Company used the Diehl bulb to force the holders of the Edison patent to charge a more reasonable rate {{for the use of the}} Edison patent rights.|$|R
50|$|Edward H. Johnson was {{a partner}} in the <b>Edison</b> Electric <b>Lamp</b> Company, a {{partnership}} formed in early 1881. Other partners were Thomas Edison, Charles Batchelor, and Francis Upton. In May 1881 the company changed its name to the <b>Edison</b> <b>Lamp</b> Company. A year later it moved its factory from Menlo Park to East Newark (Harrison), New Jersey. The partnership became a corporation in 1884. The company merged with several other Edison companies in 1889 to become the Edison General Electric Company. The same year, it acquired the Sprague Electric Railway & Motor Company. On April 15, 1892, it merged with the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, another electrical manufacturer, in the consolidation forming the General Electric Company, which is today one of the largest Fortune 500 companies in the United States.|$|R
50|$|Electric {{lighting}} with {{incandescent lamps}} {{was one of}} key developments {{on display at the}} exposition, with up to 2500 lamps used to light the venue. The <b>lamps</b> of Thomas <b>Edison,</b> St. George Lane-Fox, Hiram Maxim, and Joseph Swan were compared in extensive tests by a committee, including exposition juror William Crookes, to establish the most efficient lamp design. The conclusion was the high resistance <b>Edison</b> <b>lamp</b> was the most efficient, followed by the Lane-Fox, Swan, and Maxim lamps.|$|R
5000|$|When {{properly}} tightened, {{the connections}} are physically and electrically secure because they firmly contact a large section of wire. The terminals are relatively low cost {{compared with other}} types of connector, and a screw terminal can easily be integrated into the design of a building wiring device (such as a socket, switch, or <b>lamp</b> <b>holder).</b>|$|R

That year, he joined the Research Laboratory of General Electric Company (GE). He would work at GE {{for the rest of}} his career except for a 1922-1925 stint as the Research Division director at <b>Edison</b> <b>Lamp</b> Works. His main research interests were quantum mechanics, electromotive force, atomic structure, electron emission, unimolecular force, and high vacuum, and he authored several standard science textbooks.|$|R
50|$|Geologist Scott Martin {{discovered}} {{fragments of}} alien crystals in an underground cave that housed a massive underground city. The city itself was {{powered by the}} massive Ko-Dan crystal. Scott defeated the city's ruler Tyrnos in a battle of wills to gain control over a shard of the crystal, Scott won and the crystal embedded itself in his hardhat's <b>lamp</b> <b>holder,</b> and he later became The Beacon.|$|R

50|$|Tealights are {{especially}} popular {{for use with}} candle holders. From small pockets of glass, metal, ceramic and other materials to larger, more elaborate tea light <b>lamps,</b> <b>holders</b> come {{in a wide range}} of styles, colours, and shapes. Holders have an appropriately sized cup to use a tealight candle, either scented or unscented. Discount stores, gift stores, and home decor stores often carry an array of holders for these small candles.|$|R
50|$|Ceramic {{infrared}} heating elements {{are used in}} a diverse range of industrial processes where long wave infrared radiation is required. Their useful wavelength range is 2-10 µm. They are often used {{in the area of}} animal/pet healthcare too. The ceramic infrared heaters (emitters) are manufactured with three basic emitter faces: trough (concave), flat, and bulb or Edison screw element for normal installation via an E27 ceramic <b>lamp</b> <b>holder.</b>|$|R

50|$|Edison screw (ES) is a {{standard}} socket for light bulbs in the United States. It was developed by Thomas Edison and was licensed in 1909 under the Mazda trademark. Normally, the bulbs have right-hand threaded metal bases (caps) which screw into matching threaded sockets (<b>lamp</b> <b>holders).</b> For bulbs powered by AC current, the thread is connected to neutral and the contact on the bottom tip of the base is connected to hot.|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{an early}} form of {{insulated}} cable, introduced in 1896, {{consisted of two}} impregnated-paper-insulated conductors in an overall lead sheath. Joints were soldered, and special fittings were used for <b>lamp</b> <b>holders</b> and switches. These cables were similar to underground telegraph and telephone cables of the time. Paper-insulated cables proved unsuitable for interior wiring installations because very careful workmanship was required on the lead sheaths to ensure moisture {{did not affect the}} insulation.|$|R
