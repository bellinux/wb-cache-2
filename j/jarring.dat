5|$|The Pixies {{achieved}} modest {{popularity in}} their home country, but were more successful in the United Kingdom, mainland Europe and Israel. Their <b>jarring</b> pop sound influenced bands such as Nirvana, Radiohead, the Strokes, Bush, Blur and Weezer. Their popularity grew {{in the years following}} their break-up, leading to sold-out world tours following their reunion in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Morris {{ended the}} {{first-class}} matches with 1,922 runs at 71.18 including seven centuries, ranking him second in runs only to Bradman (2,428 at 89.92) and substantially ahead of third-placed Hassett (1,563 at 74.42). He did so despite being troubled by a {{split between the}} first and second fingers of his left hand, caused by constant <b>jarring</b> from the bat as he played the ball. The wound often opened while he was batting, forcing him to undergo a minor operation which sidelined him from some matches in the latter part of the tour.|$|E

5000|$|In the Gungan city of Otoh Gunga, Chef Marshoo catches <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar</b> Binks in {{the kitchen}} trying to {{scavenge}} leftovers. Marshoo prepares to punch <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar</b> just as Captain Roos Tarpals comes in to arrest <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar</b> for the very same thing. He puts the handcuffs on <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar</b> and takes him away. Soon after, Tarpals tells <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar</b> that everyone down at the station is calling him [...] "The Death of Captain Tarpals." [...] Suddenly Tarpals is ambushed by Marshoo {{and some of his}} friends, who prepare to beat down <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar</b> as they'd planned. They throw a frying pan at <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar,</b> but he ducks, and it goes flying into his kaadu, who retaliates with a kick to Marshoo, sending him and his cohorts into a small fountain. <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar</b> revives Tarpals, and asks to be released after taking care of Marshoo. Roos ignores him and takes him to the surface of Naboo, where he shall live {{for a long time to}} come.|$|R
50|$|<b>Jar</b> <b>Jar</b> {{lands on}} Tatooine, {{crushing}} three Tusken Raiders as it falls. <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar</b> begins to vacuum toward Jabba the Hutt's Sail Barge. The camera then shows Boba Fett aiming at <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar</b> from the Sail Barge. He begins shooting at <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar,</b> but he misses. <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar</b> notices, horrified, and runs away. Boba flies {{out of the}} sail barge to get closer. He flies by a desert skiff where the battle from Return of the Jedi ensues. He gets too close, and gets knocked into the Pit of Carkoon and is devoured by the Sarlacc.|$|R
50|$|Star Wars - In {{honor of}} the release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Tom blends a figure of his {{favorite}} character, <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar</b> Binks (since nobody else likes him), by sticking him in the <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar</b> on the blender.|$|R
5|$|At the time, most British {{television}} drama {{was shot}} {{on a combination}} of film and videotape. Usually location shooting would be on film and studio work would be recorded on video. The effect of the change in medium from film to video (or vice versa) during a scene change in a programme could be <b>jarring</b> for some viewers. Boucher structured his scripts carefully so that all the Earth-based scenes would be shot on film on location and all the space scenes would be recorded on video in the studio hoping that the effect would give the space scenes a unique look. He was disappointed, therefore, to discover that Gridneff had decided to record the entire series on videotape.|$|E
5|$|M.I.A. {{made her}} North American live debut in February 2005 in Toronto where concertgoers already knew {{many of her}} songs. In March 2005, M.I.A.'s debut album Arular was {{released}} worldwide to critical acclaim after several months delay. The album title is the nom de guerre that M.I.A.'s father took {{when he joined the}} Tamil independence movement, and many of the songs acknowledge her and her father's experiences in Jaffna. While making Arular in her bedroom in west London, she built tracks off her demos, using beats she programmed on the Roland MC-505. The album experiments with bold, <b>jarring</b> and ambient sounds, and its lyrics address the Iraq War and daily life in London as well as M.I.A.'s past.|$|E
5|$|Full focus shifted onto The Missing Link when {{development}} {{ended on}} Human Revolution, {{with the main}} game's staff bringing their experience to bear upon the DLC when building its environments. The story was designed {{so that it would}} not spoil the events of the main narrative, but instead be a self-contained experience that would provide more context to the setting. The game's title referred to both its status as filling a narrative gap, and an in-game plot element. The DLC was developed as a stand-alone experience, accessible through the main menu independent of the player's place within the main game. This was due to technical problems related to the improvement work at transitioning {{from one to the other}} at its chronological point: the higher detail and polish would have made the experience <b>jarring</b> for players.|$|E
2500|$|Following the credits, {{there is}} a {{continuation}} of the [...] "Vader and <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar</b> Reunion" [...] sketch, where the ghost of <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar</b> is still annoying Vader.|$|R

5|$|His feet {{position}} were peculiar in {{that his}} front foot was {{parallel to the}} crease and his back foot perpendicular, {{the opposite of the}} conventional posture. This inhibited his follow through and put more stress on his ankles and shins. As a result, his right ankle had to be bound tightly in order to prevent <b>jarring</b> from his awkward delivery. He also followed the recommendation of Bill O'Reilly and tied a towel around his shins to cut off the circulation and to dull the pain. After the knee injury, he altered his action into a more conventional one so that his front foot pointed towards the batsman. This eased the pressure on his body, but his ability to move the ball diminished. Johnston was a keen student of the game, and although he did not see a state match until his debut, and watched only one Test before his debut, he supplemented his knowledge by reading cricket books. During his early first-class career, upon returning from matches, he would read articles by Bradman, Bert Oldfield and Arthur Mailey from a book given to him by his schoolteacher when he was a schoolboy.|$|E
5|$|Difficulty delaying {{gratification}} {{also plays}} a role in internalizing disorders like anxiety and depression. A hallmark behavior in anxiety is avoidance of feared or anxiety-provoking situations. By seeking the immediate relief that comes with avoidance, a person is succumbing to the pull of instant gratification over the larger reward from overcoming the fear and anxiety that caused the avoidance. Procrastination, which is often a reflection of anxiety, is a clear example: a person avoids a dreaded task by engaging in a more enjoyable immediate activity instead. Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a more <b>jarring</b> case of this anxiety-related struggle to delay gratification; someone with OCD is unable to resist compulsions that temporarily mitigate the torture of obsessive thoughts, even though these compulsions do not banish the obsessions in the long run. One experiment, however, did not find any significant differences between samples with OCD and healthy controls in delayed gratification, while finding substantially improved delayed gratification among those with obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. Depression is also associated with lower capacity to delay gratification, though the direction of cause and effect is not clear. A depressed person who has difficulty pushing him or herself to engage in previously enjoyed activities is (deliberately or not) prioritizing short-term comfort and is demonstrating an impaired ability to delay gratification. There is evidence that individuals who engage in deliberate self-harm (i.e., cut themselves) are less able to tolerate emotional distress but are more able to tolerate physical pain. Thus it is argued that they injure themselves because they cannot delay gratification and need a way to end emotional pain quickly.|$|E
25|$|On November 23, 1967, the Secretary General {{appointed}} Gunnar <b>Jarring</b> as Special Envoy {{to negotiate}} {{the implementation of the}} resolution with the parties, the so-called <b>Jarring</b> Mission. The governments of Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon recognized Jarring's appointment and agreed to participate in his shuttle diplomacy, although they differed on key points of interpretation of the resolution. The government of Syria rejected Jarring's mission on grounds that total Israeli withdrawal was a prerequisite for further negotiations. The talks under Jarring's auspices lasted until 1973, but bore no results. After 1973, the <b>Jarring</b> mission was replaced by bilateral and multilateral peace conferences.|$|E
50|$|Part 2 {{begins with}} <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar</b> and Boba Fett {{floating}} helplessly in space. <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar</b> lands on Hoth, traveling on the Death Star's debris. Rebel Troopers {{run by an}} Imperial AT-AT walker and Snowtroopers giving chase. As the AT-AT passes by, Luke Skywalker is seen hanging onto the back. <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar</b> is then {{picked up by the}} Wampa and thrown out to space.|$|R
50|$|Landing on the Death Star, Chewbacca {{can be seen}} {{taken away}} by stormtroopers. After they left, <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar</b> leaves the ship, unaware of Boba Fett. While {{vacuuming}} a corridor, Boba takes aim but is interrupted by Han Solo chasing two stormtroopers. Once again taking aim at <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar,</b> Boba is once again interrupted by a squad of stormtroopers chasing Han. Boba then sees Indiana Jones running by but is too slow and gets {{run over by a}} boulder. As <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar</b> starts playing with the vacuum like a guitar, he gets carried away and his hand is reaching {{closer and closer to the}} Self Destruct button for the Death Star. Boba yells, trying to get <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar's</b> attention but it is too late. <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar</b> presses the button and a Self Destruct display of the Death begins with a three-second countdown. In outer space, <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar's</b> music can be heard before the Death Star blows up.|$|R
5000|$|Antique canning <b>jars</b> {{are often}} sold through antique stores and auction {{sites such as}} eBay. The value of a <b>jar</b> is related to its age, rarity, color, and condition. A <b>jar's</b> age and rarity can be {{determined}} by the color, shape, mold and production marks of the glass, and the <b>jar's</b> closure. Mason <b>jars</b> usually have a proprietary brand embossed on the <b>jar.</b> Early <b>jars</b> embossed with [...] "Mason's Patent November 28th 1858" [...] that date from the late 1850s to early 1860s closely match the illustrations of Mason's 1858 patents. Mouth-blown <b>jars</b> embossed with a version of [...] "Mason's Patent November 28th 1858" [...] were made about 1857 to 1908. By 1908 semi-automatic machines manufactured the majority of these <b>jars.</b> Machine-made Mason <b>jars</b> that originated around 1909 have a sealing surface on a bead ledge below the threads. This type of <b>jar</b> dominated the market by the mid to late 1910s. Manufacturers continued to make <b>jars</b> with the beaded seal after the mid-twentieth century. Ball's [...] "Ideal" [...] canning <b>jar,</b> which first appeared around 1915 and was discontinued in 1962, is one of the company's best-known <b>jars</b> and is popular among collectors.|$|R
25|$|Bicycle {{suspension}} {{refers to}} the system or systems used to suspend the rider and {{all or part of}} the bicycle. This serves two purposes: to keep the wheels in continuous contact with the ground, improving control, and to isolate the rider and luggage from <b>jarring</b> due to rough surfaces, improving comfort.|$|E
25|$|Elbow {{and knee}} pads: Common among outdoor sports, players {{can choose to}} help protect knee, elbow and even hip joints from <b>jarring</b> impact {{with the use of}} pads. For paintball, these pads are {{generally}} soft foam worn inside a player's pants to prevent abrasion of the pad against the ground.|$|E
25|$|Hitchcock {{and costume}} {{designer}} Edith Head used color to heighten emotion. Grey {{was chosen for}} Madeleine's suit {{because it is not}} usually a blonde's colour, so was psychologically <b>jarring.</b> In contrast, Novak's character wore a white coat when she visited Scottie's apartment, which Head and Hitchcock considered more natural for a blonde to wear.|$|E
50|$|Obi-Wan {{appears at}} <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar's</b> residence; he draws a pistol on <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar,</b> robbing {{him and then}} {{shooting}} him before fleeing. <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar</b> later dies in a hospital with Ani being there for his final moments. Ani decides {{to give up on}} racing on the fear he may be targeted next but is convinced otherwise by Tarkin and Mara, who remind Ani of his dream.|$|R
5000|$|Colored <b>jars</b> were {{considered}} better for canning because the color blocked some light {{from reaching the}} food, which helps to retain flavor and nutritional value longer. Most antique <b>jars</b> that are not colorless are aqua or [...] "Ball blue," [...] a blue-green shade that was named for the Ball Corporation, a prevalent <b>jar</b> manufacturer. Most mouth-blown Mason <b>jars</b> embossed with some type of 1858 patent date were produced in aqua glass. The Ball brand of Mason <b>jars</b> were manufactured in several colors, but the most common color was the distinctive [...] "Ball blue," [...] which the Ball Corporation used in its <b>jars</b> from about 1910 to 1930. Mason <b>jars</b> with this particular color of glass {{may be attributed to}} Ball, since [...] "virtually no other bottle or <b>jar</b> was made in that color." [...] More rarely, <b>jars</b> will turn up in amber, and occasionally in darker shades of green. Rarer still are cobalt blue, black, and milk-glass <b>jars.</b> Some unscrupulous dealers will irradiate <b>jars</b> to bring out colors not original to the <b>jar.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{new type}} of Mason <b>jar</b> known as a [...] "bead" [...] <b>jar</b> was {{introduced}} around 1910 to 1915. These continuous screw-thread <b>jars</b> were designed with a bead between the screw threads and the shoulder as a sealing surface. The Ball Perfect Mason <b>jar,</b> {{one of the most}} common <b>jars</b> of this style, was introduced around 1913 and produced until the mid-twentieth century. It had several variations, including a square-shaped <b>jar.</b> During the twentieth century, bead <b>jars</b> were sealed with two-piece metal lids. The <b>jar</b> lid had a rubber or rubber-like sealing surface and was held in place by a separate metal band. This type of <b>jar</b> and closure, which first became popular in the late 1910s and 1920s, is still in use.|$|R
25|$|When {{trade and}} tourism produce a {{confluence}} of cultures, bringing differing sensibilities regarding blackface into contact with one another, {{the results can be}} <b>jarring.</b> When Japanese toymaker Sanrio Corporation exported a darky-icon character doll (the doll, Bibinba, had fat, pink lips and rings in its ears) in the 1990s, the ensuing controversy prompted Sanrio to halt production.|$|E
25|$|By 1992, Mustaine's vocal {{performance}} and style, along with Megadeth's bombastic aesthetic, were considered <b>jarring</b> by some music listeners, meaning {{they had not}} yet been exposed to more mainstream audiences. Partially due to the success and radio friendliness of this song and Countdown to Extinction, Megadeth was capable of reaching a higher level of public awareness and cultural relevance.|$|E
25|$|Understanding a {{particular}} musical style's treatment of dissonance—what is considered dissonant and what rules or procedures govern how dissonant intervals, chords, or notes are treated—is key in understanding that particular style. For instance, harmony is generally governed by chords, which are collections of notes defined as tolerably consonant by the style. (There is likely, however, to be {{a hierarchy of}} chords, with some considered more consonant and some more dissonant.) Any note that does not fall within the prevailing harmony is considered dissonant. A given style typically pays attention to how its musical structure approaches dissonance (in steps is less <b>jarring,</b> a leap is more <b>jarring),</b> and even more to how they resolve (almost always by step), to how they fit within the meter and rhythm (dissonances on strong beats are more emphatic, those on weaker beats less vital), and to how they lie within the phrase (dissonances tend to resolve at phrase's end).|$|E

25|$|Berendsen {{served as}} the country's first High Commissioner to Australia, from 1943 until 1944. He was then {{transferred}} to Washington, D.C., where he served as Minister to the United States between 1944 and 1952. In late 1967 he was appointed as {{member of the team}} headed by UN envoy Gunnar <b>Jarring</b> to establish peace in the Middle East following the Six Day War.|$|E
25|$|After the 1967 war Gunnar <b>Jarring</b> was {{appointed}} by the UN as a special envoy for the Middle East peace process, leading the <b>Jarring</b> Mission. The talks between Arab countries and Israel resulted in a deadlock. The stalemate led to renewed fears of another war between Arab countries and Israel. Worried that Jordan would be dragged into another war unprepared, Hussein sent Zaid Al-Rifai to Egyptian president Anwar Sadat in December 1972 to inquire. Sadat informed Al-Rifai {{that he had been}} planning a limited incursion in the Sinai that would allow some political manoeuvring. Sadat then invited Al-Rifai and Hussein to a summit on 10September 1973 with him and Hafez Al-Assad, who had become president of Syria. The summit ended with a restoration of ties between Jordan, Egypt, and Syria. Sadat disclosed to Assad and Hussein his intention to initiate military action. Hussein refused Sadat's request to allow the fedayeen's return to Jordan but agreed that in case of a military operation, Jordanian troops would play a limited defensive role in assisting the Syrians in the Golan Heights.|$|E
25|$|Another major {{complaint}} {{about the film}} was Bay's usage of the IMAX format. Instead of using IMAX for complete unbroken sequences similar to director Christopher Nolan's approach for The Dark Knight, Bay chose to use the format primarily on a shot-by-shot basis, combining conventional 35mm footage and IMAX shots in the same sequence. That approach, combined with rapid cutting, created a <b>jarring,</b> highly unpleasant experience for most moviegoers.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>jar</b> was {{an early}} unit of {{capacitance}} once used by the British Royal Navy. The term originated as the capacitance of a Leyden <b>jar.</b> Its value is such that one farad is [...] <b>jars</b> and one <b>jar</b> is 1111 picofarads.|$|R
5000|$|A Leyden <b>jar,</b> or Leiden <b>jar,</b> is {{a device}} that [...] "stores" [...] static {{electricity}} between two electrodes {{on the inside and}} outside of a glass <b>jar.</b> A Leyden <b>jar</b> typically consists of a glass <b>jar</b> with metal foil cemented to the inside and the outside surfaces, and a metal terminal projecting vertically through the <b>jar</b> lid to make contact with the inner foil. It was the original form of a capacitor (originally known as a [...] "condenser").|$|R
5000|$|The {{company would}} on {{occasion}} issue <b>jars</b> of Cocoa Marsh with a toy surprize {{hidden in a}} double top. The regular metal <b>jar</b> cover had an additional white top cover approx. 3/4" [...] tall attached with a white plastic strip. The toy surprise was located in this top cover.
