5000|$|Vitamins and {{minerals}} {{are required for}} normal metabolism but which the body cannot manufacture itself and which must therefore come from external sources.

Many minerals are also essential in small quantities including iron, calcium, magnesium, sodium chloride and sulfur; and in very small quantities copper, zinc and selenium.

40|$|During {{the past}} ten years the world demand for vitamin A has {{increased}} steadily. The increase is due partly to growing popularity of vitamin therapy and partly to the enormous rate at which vitamin A is being used in America for animal feeding. During the war years it has been used extensively for food fortification in England and Europe, and this will probably be continued for several years. It is very difficult to estimate the annual world consumption of vitamin A, but we know that in America 67 x 10 ¹² International Units (I. U.) were used in 1939. Approximately 60 % of this quantity was used for animal feeding. We also know that in England the fortification of margarine is compulsory and that the diet of all school children is supplemented with vitamin A. The distribution of the world production of vitamin A was seriously disrupted by the war, when the Norwegian and Japanese productions were cut off from their normal destinations. Under these circumstances {{it is no wonder that}} the United States, Canada, South Africa, India and Australia made serious and successful attempts to produce <b>fish</b> <b>liver</b> <b>oils,</b> the main source of vitamin A. Argentina produced 25 x 10 ¹² U. S. P. units in 1945 and the United States 9 x 10 ¹³ U. S. P. units in the same year. The South African production increased from 2 x 10 ¹² I. U., valued at £ 80, 000 in 1943, which year may be regarded as the birth of the South African industry, to 1 x l 0 ¹³ I. U., valued at £ 400, 000 in 1946 - 1947.

How-ever, there is considerable disagreement as to the amount of destruction or how rapid-ly such destruction takes place. Fraps and Treichler (1933) reported losses in vitamin A potency of 30 - 80 per-cent in 6 to 19 months in alfalfa leaf meal, dried black-eyed peas, dried green sweet peppers, yellow corn (whole or ground), and powdered whole milk.

40|$|Since the World Health Organizations subcomittee on Fat-Soluble Vitamins {{published}} {{their recommendations}} for the determination of vitamin A (21), new methods based on their recommendations have been adopted by U.

The present paper reports results from {{the investigation of the}} effects of these new methods on the evaluation of the vitamin A potency of <b>fish</b> <b>liver</b> <b>oils.</b> Further there have been included applications of the recently published corretion equations of Cama et al.

Since these data speak largely for themselves, only brief explanations and comments are given. The determination according to the WHO's method were carried out in ethanol, and the correction procedure of Morton & Stubbs (2) was applied to the absorption curves. The results show E (1 %) / 1 cm (325 mµ) -values agreeing within ± 3 % before application of corrections, compared to ± 12 % after. The corresponding figures for the U. S. P. XIV method were respectively ± 2 % and ± 6 %, and for the B. P. Add. - 51 method ± 2, 5 % and ± 15 %. These figures are in agreement with other reports from applications of the respective methods (10, 11, 19) ] When compared with the E-values from the chromatographic method, all the differently corrected E-values are lower. This is particularly the case were the correction equations are built on the new curves for all-trans-vitamin A (Cama et al., U. S. P. XIV, and B. P. Add. - 51) The B. P. Add. - 51 values of the unsaponifiable matter give a mean which is only 81 % of the >>Gridgeman values<<.

This can include food pathogens and toxic food components, alcohol, and dietary supplements such as vitamin A and potentially harmful pathogens such as listeria, toxoplasmosis, and salmonella. Dietary vitamin A is obtained in two forms which contain the preformed vitamin (retinol), that can be found in some animal products such as <b>liver</b> and <b>fish</b> <b>liver</b> <b>oils,</b> and as a vitamin A precursor in the form of carotene, which can be found in many fruits and vegetables. Intake of large amounts or, conversely, a deficiency, of retinol has been linked to birth defects and abnormalities. It is noted that a 100 g serving of liver may contain a large amount of retinol, so it is best that it is not eaten daily during pregnancy. Excessive amounts of alcohol have been proven to cause fetal alcohol syndrome. The World Health Organization recommends that alcohol should be avoided entirely during pregnancy, given the relatively unknown effects of even small amounts of alcohol during pregnancy.

40|$|Abstract Background Common warts (verruca vulgaris) are benign {{epithelial}} proliferations {{associated with}} human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Salicylic acid and cryotherapy {{are the most}} frequent treatments for common warts, but can be painful and cause scarring, and have high failure and recrudescence rates.

Case The subject is a healthy, physically-active 30 old female with a 9 year history of common warts on the back of the right hand. The warts resisted treatment with salicylic acid, apple cider vinegar and an over-the-counter blend of essential oils marketed for the treatment of warts. Daily topical application of natural vitamin A derived from <b>fish</b> <b>liver</b> <b>oil</b> (25, 000 IU) led to replacement of all the warts with normal skin.

40|$|THE use of {{fish liver}} oils and fish meals has {{presented}} {{a problem to}} poultry producers on account of fishy flavor im-parted to the meat.

Patients suffering from this genetic condition have progressive nyctalopia and eventually their daytime vision may also be affected. In X-linked congenital stationary night blindness, from birth the rods either do not work at all, or work very little, but the condition doesn't get worse.Another cause of night blindness is a deficiency of retinol, or vitamin A, found in <b>fish</b> <b>oils,</b> <b>liver</b> and dairy products.|$|R
40|$|Vitamin D is a {{micronutrient}} that {{is needed}} for optimal health throughout the whole life. Vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) can be either synthesized in the human skin upon exposure to the UV light of the sun, or it is obtained from the diet. If the photoconversion in the skin due to reduced sun exposure (e. g. in wintertime) is insufficient, intake of adequate vitamin D from the diet is essential to health. Severe vitamin D deficiency can lead to multitude of avoidable illnesses; among them are well known bone diseases like osteoporosis, a number of autoimmune diseases, many different cancers and some cardiovascular diseases like hypertension are being discussed. Vitamin D is found naturally in only very few foods. Foods containing vitamin D include some fatty <b>fish,</b> <b>fish</b> <b>liver</b> <b>oils,</b> and eggs from hens that have been fed vitamin D and some fortified foods in countries with respective regulations. Base on geographic location or food availability adequate vitamin D intake might not be sufficient on a global scale. The International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) has collected the 25 -hydroxy-vitamin D plasma levels in populations of different countries using published data and developed a global vitamin D map. This map illustrates {{the parts of the}} world, where vitamin D did not reach adequate 25 -hydroxyvitamin D plasma levels: 6. 7 % of the papers report 25 -hydroxyvitamin D plasma levels below 25 nmol/L, which indicates vitamin D deficiency, 37. 3 % are below 50 nmol/Land only 11. 9 % found 25 -hydroxy-vitamin D plasma levels above 75 nmol/L target as suggested by vitamin D experts. The vitamin D map is adding further evidence to the vitamin D insufficiency pandemic debate, which is also an issue in the developed world. Besides malnutrition, a condition where the diet does not match to provide the adequate levels of nutrients including micronutrients for growth and maintenance, we obviously have a situation where enough nutrients were consumed, but lacked to reach sufficient vita...|$|R
