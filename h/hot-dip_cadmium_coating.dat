Historically, {{there has not been}} a corrosion resistant alloy available that meets the strength requirements and provides adequate corrosion protection. Therefore, the use of cadmium coatings has been the preferred method of corrosion protection in landing gear systems for decades. In recent years, a new ultrahigh-strength corrosion resistant alloy has been developed (UNS S 10500) that has potential to reduce or eliminate the use of <b>cadmium</b> <b>coating</b> within landing gear systems. A comparison of various protection schemes (primer and paint only, zinc-nickel, and cadmium) for this new alloy were compared to other ultrahigh-strength steels (UNS G 43400, UNS K 44200, UNS K 92580, and UNS K 91973) using their currently recommended protection schemes for landing gear (primarily cadmium).

40|$|Electroplated cadmium is {{currently}} used as· an effective hydrogen diffusion barrier on ferrous based alloys. Many of these alloys {{are susceptible to}} hydrogen embrittlement, and cadmium electroplating {{has been shown to}} Be a very efficient method of reducing hydrogen induced failures. However, industrial cadmium plating wastes are toxic and expensive to process for proper disposal. Current government regulations regarding this waste disposal have encouraged commercial platers away from cadmium as an amphoteric coating. Zinc is frequently used and aluminum looks encouraging as an alternative to cadmium electroplates. In order to accurately assess the effectiveness of these alternative coatings to cadmium, it is first necessary to quantitatively determine the permeation rate of hydrogen through cadmium electroplated coatings. Hydrogen permeation experiments can be done in an electrochemical cell with electronically generated hydrogen using a technique known as the electrochemical hydro-gen permeation method. Previous work at th_e University of Rhode Island, using this method, has determined the necessity for a controlled sample preparation te technique in order to get reproducibility of data. It has also been determined {{that it is necessary to}} coat the inlet and exit surfaces of the sample membrane with an inert coating to prevent reaction of the test sample material or coating with either th. e inlet or exit electrolyte. Also, this inert coating must not be the rate determining step for the hydrogen permeation rate. In this project, an electroplating bath and technique was developed that would provide a thin flash of palladium over the inlet and exit surfaces of the sample membrane. Electron microscopy was used to check the integrity of these inert coatings. The base metal chosen for this project was a high purity 2 ̆ 2 Ferrovac E 2 ̆ 2 iron. The first phase of the tests was to replicate earlier experiments on a pure palladium-iron palladium membrane in order to confirm the proper functioning of the experimental technique. After this, it was necessary to determine the rate controlling step of the sample membrane with a cadmium electroplate just inside the palladium coating on the inlet side of the membrane. Cadmium should be rate controlling, and this is determined by varying the thickness of the iron substrate and observing the variations in steady state permeation rates. Finally, the effects of various thicknesses of cadmium electroplated coatings was determined by observing the changes in steady state permeation rates. The results of tests with samples without <b>cadmium</b> <b>coating</b> closely resembled those of earlier researchers at University of Rhode Island, which confirmed the proper function of the equipment. The tests per. for. med with a constant cadmium plating thickness and various iron substrate thicknesses showed a relatively small difference in steady state permeation rate, which proved the cadmium layer to be the rate controlling step. The tests with various thicknesses of cadmium on a constant iron substrate thickness proved again that the cadmium was rate controlling...|$|R

30|$|Nanocrystal {{surface defects}} such as {{dangling}} selenide bonds {{have been described}} as charge carrier trap sites, and have been associated with less than optimal optical (and device) performance [32]. The objective of increased brightness of photoluminescence (quantum yield) has led to efforts of passivating surface defects with organic or inorganic ligands, either during the synthesis or afterwards. For example, Talapin et al. showed that incorporation of alkylamines, particularly hexadecylamine (HDA), into the synthesis led to much improved quantum yields (as high as 50 %) [33]. This dramatic improvement was attributed to the passivation of the cadmium selenide surface defects with the HDA ligands. However, Alivisatos pointed out that it is generally very difficult to simultaneously passivate both anionic and cationic surface sites by organic ligands because there would always remain some dangling bonds [34]. For this reason, inorganic passivation is generally more effective for creating very bright quantum dots. An additional layer (shell) of higher band gap material grown around the surface of the nanocrystal (core) serves to passivate both the anionic and cationic surface dangling bonds in these “core/shell” or “capped” systems. In the case of zinc sulfide (CdSe/ZnS) [33, 35, 36] or cadmium sulfide (CdSe/CdS) [34, 37, 38] <b>coated</b> <b>cadmium</b> selenide quantum dots, much improved photoluminescence properties and photostability is observed with quantum yields of up to 85 % in solution [38]. However, this inorganic surface modification creates a new nanocrystal system with properties which are dependent on both core and shell materials. In addition, the shell can serve as an insulating medium that limits electronic communication with surface ligands or the environment.|$|R

However, these same properties entail new challenges in understanding, predicting, and managing potential adverse health effects following exposure. Cadmium and selenium, which are the major components {{of the majority of}} quantum dots, are known to be acutely and chronically toxic to cells and organisms. Protecting the core of nanoparticles can, to some degree, control the toxicity related to cadmium and selenium leakage. Results This study successfully synthesized and characterized maltodextrin <b>coated</b> <b>cadmium</b> sulfide semiconductor nanoparticles. The results show that CdS-MD nanoparticles are cytotoxic and embryotoxic. CdS-MD nanoparticles in low concentrations (4. 92 and 6. 56 nM) lightly increased the number of HepG 2 cell. A reduction in MDA-MB- 231 cells was observed with concentrations higher than 4. 92 nM in a dose response manner, while Caco- 2 cells showed an important increase starting at 1. 64 nM. CdS-MD nanoparticles induced cell death by apoptosis and necrosis in MDA-MD- 231 cells starting at 8. 20 nM concentrations in a dose response manner. The exposure of these cells to 11. 48 - 14. 76 nM of CdS-MD nanoparticles induced ROS production. The analysis of cell proliferation in MDA-MB- 231 showed different effects.

40|$|Critical {{materials}} represent mostly metals {{having a}} big importance {{for the future of}} the economy in the European countries. It is very difficult to replace these critical metals by other metals. Because of their wide application, the demand for these metals is increased, but the production cannot follow their growing consumption. Rare earth elements (REE) belong to critical materials. They include 17 elements, very similar in terms of their chemical and physical properties due to their mineralogical structure (the best-known are lanthanum and thorium, which is radioactive). REE are divided into elements with a lower atomic mass and elements with a higher atomic mass. Heavier metals show a significantly lower presence in the upper earth crust. In 2010, the share of the REE production in China in the global production amounted to 97 %, constituting a near-monopoly in the world market. In different studies, the term “Strategic” is often used instead “of “critical” materials. The materials for military application are called “Strategic” (nickel). In comparison to strategic metals, critical materials have a big importance for the national economies of European countries (platinum group of metals, rare earth elements, cobalt). The European Commission prepared a strategic development plan for critical materials in the next twenty years. The rare earth elements The rare earth elements include 15 elements (Z= 57 through 71) and Yttrium (Z= 39) and scandium. Because of their reactivity and similarity, the REEs were found to be difficult to obtain [...] Lanthanide elements with a low atomic number are generally more abundant in the earth crust than those with high atomic numbers. World demand for rare earth elements is estimated by Humphries (CRS Report for Congress) at 134. 000 tons per year, with the global production of around 114. 000 tons annually. Humphries has reported in 2010 that there is no rare earth mine production in the United States. The major uses for rare earth elements include applications in auto catalysts, petroleum refining, metal alloys, cell phones, portable DVDs, etc. Permanent magnets containing neodymium, gadolinium and dysprosium are used in numerous electrical components and generators for wind turbines. The primary defense application (underwater mine detection, satellite power and communication systems, radar systems,etc.) use new materials: Neodymium Iron Boron, Samarium Cobalt. REEs extraction from monazite is performed by dissolution in a hot concentrated base or acid solutions. After cooling, the hydroxides of REEs and thorium are recovered by filtration, and thorium is separated by dissolution and selective precipitation. Metallurgy of indium   Indium belongs to the group of rare earth elements with a low melting point. Some addition of indium increases the strength, hardness and corrosion resistance of alloys. The most known producers are situated in Belgium, Canada, Russia, France and Japan. Indium is used as coating on metals applied in difficult operation conditions, and in semiconductor techniques for the production of diodes. It is formed as a semi-product after pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical treatment of sulphidic raw materials. Indium can be used with other valuable metals such as vanadium, thallium, gallium, germanium, and <b>cadmium.</b> The <b>coating</b> process based on Indium is performed by an electrolytic treatment on the surface.   Metallurgy of yttrium Yttrium compounds found interesting application in many fields. In particular, yttrium is used in the manufacture of superconductors, in super alloys of nickel and cobalt, and solid oxide fuel cells. Yttrium oxide has a high melting point and is used in ceramics. The compounds of yttrium are also used as catalysts. The growing industrial application of the rare earth elements led to a growing interest in finding new technologies for their recoveries. The selective dissolution of yttrium from lanthanum is performed by ammonium carbonate leaching. Conclusion The EU Raw materials Initiative was decided to identify a list of critical raw materials at the EU level. The EU-report describes a selection of 41 minerals and metals. Then, 14 elements were chosen as critical materials fort the economy of the European countries in the next twenty years. The future use of REEs is expected to be increased in the European countries. About 90 % of metal alloys are produced in China. The price of rare earth elements is reduced for the consumers in China in comparison to some companies in the USA and Europe. Therefore, the European countries and the USA have protested against this situation. The selective winning of rare earth elements is the most important aim in the processing of raw materials. The combination of pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical methods might be a new way of solving this problem in the European countries. </div...|$|R
