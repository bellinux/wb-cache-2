40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} impact of HOPE VI (Housing Opportunities for People Everywhere), a Housing and Urban Development (HUD) program, on Tampa 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Greenwood</b> neighborhood. The program represents a policy shift away from traditional public housing toward a 2 ̆ 2 mixed income 2 ̆ 2 model that has effectively privatized public housing. Through a HOPE VI program implemented in Tampa in 2000, two public housing complexes were demolished and redeveloped in this way. While some former residents of public housing relocated to other public housing complexes, many moved to apartments and houses in the private rental market with Section 8 subsidized housing vouchers-many to Tampa 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Greenwood</b> neighborhood. In the dissertation, I examine how these policy changes affect both those relocated to the neighborhood and those already living in the neighborhood. The dissertation also examines the social dynamics of Greenwood {{in order to understand}} an actual mixed income neighborhood. In addition, the dissertation is concerned with the intersection of HOPE VI with other neoliberal trends in Greenwood-such as models for social order and particular discourses...|$|R

This hypothesis has been tested following a two-step research design.

LITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH HYPOTHESES Many scholars agree on the role played by a limited number of strategic relationships in order to achieve and maintain competitive advantages in domestic and international markets (Diericks, Cool, 1989; Morgan, Hunt, 1999; <b>Dyer,</b> <b>Sing,</b> 1996) and underline the critical role of trust in implementing lasting relationships among economic actors (Morgan, Hunt, 1994; Hakansson, Snehota, 1995). Indeed, these relationships require highly specific learning processes and idiosyncratic investments that will appear risky unless high commitment of participants, collaborative climate and trust reduce the chance of failure (Geyskens, Steenkamp, Kumar, 1998; Jap, 1999). Regarding trust, a number of topics are often debated in the marketing literature: the interpersonal...|$|R

40|$|Publisher's copy made {{available}} {{with the permission}} of the publisherIt has been suggested that the appropriate length of insertion for double-lumen tubes can be estimated by external measurement. This study examined the accuracy of external measurement in estimating the actual length of insertion required in 130 patients. It also examined the relationship between the length inserted and the patient’s height in 126 patients and their weight in 125 patients. Although there was a fair correlation between the measured external length and the final inserted length (r= 0. 61), the 95 % confidence intervals of slope and intercept allowed a large variation and the prediction was too wide to be clinically useful. Height was reasonably well correlated with the final length (r= 0. 51) but an equally wide 95 % confidence interval rendered it of little clinical value. There was no correlation between weight and final tube length. It is concluded that external measurement alone is not adequate to predict a clinically acceptable position of the double-lumen tube. R.

40|$|The {{provision}} of care is an increasingly pressing {{issue in the}} Global North. With an ageing population and policies encouraging women into the labour market, {{there is a growing}} need for workers to undertake paid caring. This poses important and urgent questions about the social organisation of labour markets. Care work typically is low paid and undertaken in precarious, informal, or temporary situations. Many posts are filled by economic migrants, raising concerns about a care deficit in sending countries. In this paper we examine the 'caring work' undertaken by migrant workers in a West London hospital. We employ a twofold characterisation of caring work. Like other bottom-end service sector work, this work is characterised by the face-to-face 'emotional labour'. However, it also requires 'body work': close and often intimate physical contact between carers and those they care for. We argue that both of these aspects are important in understanding how caring work is constructed as poorly regarded and low paid. We show how these features play out in particular ways for migrant workers employed in such caring work.

Placental insufficiency, {{resulting}} in restriction of fetal substrate supply, {{is a major}} cause of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and increased neonatal morbidity. Fetal adaptations to placental restriction maintain the growth of key organs, including the heart, but the impact of these adaptations on individual cardiomyocytes is unknown. Placental and hence fetal growth restriction was induced in fetal sheep by removing the majority of caruncles in the ewe before mating (placental restriction, PR). Vascular surgery was performed on 13 control and 11 PR fetuses at 110 – 125 days of gestation (term: 150 ± 3 days). PR fetuses with a mean gestational PO 2 135 days), fetal hearts were collected, and cardiomyocytes were isolated and fixed. Proliferating cardiomyocytes were counted by immunohistochemistry of Ki 67 protein. Cardiomyocytes were stained with methylene blue to visualize the nuclei, and the proportion of mononucleated cells and length and width of cardiomyocytes were measured. PR resulted in chronic fetal hypoxia, IUGR, and elevated plasma cortisol concentrations. Although {{there was no difference in}} relative heart weights between control and PR fetuses, there was an increase in the proportion of mononucleated cardiomyocytes in PR fetuses. Whereas mononucleated and binucleated cardiomyocytes were smaller, the relative size of cardiomyocytes when expressed relative to heart weight was larger in PR compared with control fetuses. The increase in the relative proportion of mononucleated cardiomyocytes and the relative sparing of the growth of individual cardiomyocytes in the growth-restricted fetus are adaptations that may have long-term consequences for heart development in postnatal life.

40|$|The flow {{of labor}} out of {{production}} agriculture is analyzed using a two-sector model of occupational choice. A migration equation is specified and tested empirically using aggregate data for the United States. The economic determinants of the migration of all farm workers and farm operators are established. Farm labor {{is found to be}} responsive to changes in the returns to agricultural labor relative to nonfarm labor returns. Given this responsiveness, policies intended to increase farm income will affect the level of agricultural employment. Key words: labor migration, occupational choice, two-sector model, U. S. agricultural labor. The quantity of labor employed in agricultural production in the United States has diminished dramatically over the past several decades; farm employment dwindled from over nine million workers in 1940 to just over three million per-sons in 1985 (table 1). The flow of labor out of agriculture has been studied extensively, but oc-cupational migration at the aggregate level has not been carefully considered since the 1960 <b>s</b> (<b>Greenwood).</b> Obtaining accurate and up-to-date estimates of the determinants of occupational migration is crucial for the evaluation of agri-cultural policies that attempt to increase farm in-come and stabilize farm employment. Early studies of off-farm migration experi-enced difficulties in finding empirical relation-ships between the flow of labor out of agricul-ture and economic variables that were expected to influence the quantity of labor in the farm sector (Sjaastad 1961, Bishop).
