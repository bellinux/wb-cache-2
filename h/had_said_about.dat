5|$|A month {{following}} his trade, Jovanovski suffered a broken foot while blocking {{a shot in}} a game against the New Jersey Devils on February 9, 1999. Later in the season, he was involved in an altercation with Montreal Canadiens forward Shayne Corson. After being high-sticked in the face by Corson, the two players were sent off the ice, at which point Corson entered the Canucks' dressing room to verbally confront Jovanovski. According to Corson, the feud stemmed from comments Jovanovski <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> his family. As a result of entering the Canucks' dressing room, the Canadiens forward was later suspended five games by the NHL, in addition to one game for the high-sticking infraction. In 31 games with the Canucks that season, Jovanovski recorded two goals and 11 points. Combined with his games played with the Panthers, he totalled 27 points in 72 games.|$|E
5|$|Luther {{also had}} {{experience}} with the indulgences connected to All Saints' Church, Wittenberg. By venerating the large collection of relics at the church, one could receive an indulgence. He had preached as early as 1514 against the abuse of indulgences {{and the way they}} cheapened grace rather than requiring true repentance. Luther became especially concerned in 1517 when his parishioners, returning from purchasing Tetzel's indulgences, claimed that they no longer needed to repent and change their lives in order to be forgiven of sin. After hearing what Tetzel <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> indulgences in his sermons, Luther began to study the issue more carefully, and contacted experts on the subject. He preached about indulgences several times in 1517, explaining that true repentance was better than purchasing an indulgence. He taught that receiving an indulgence presupposed that the penitent had confessed and repented, otherwise it was worthless. A truly repentant sinner would also not seek an indulgence, because they loved God's righteousness and desired the inward punishment of their sin. These sermons seem to have ceased from April to October 1517, presumably while Luther was writing the Ninety-five Theses. He composed a Treatise on Indulgences, apparently in early autumn 1517. It is a cautious and searching examination of the subject. He contacted church leaders on the subject by letter, including his superior , Bishop of Brandenburg, sometime on or before 31 October, when he sent the Theses to Archbishop Albert of Brandenburg.|$|E

After returning to the US, Ali called Butch Lewis, and asked for Frazier's private number, saying he wanted to apologize to Frazier.

At the reception, River leaves her blank diary for Amy which prompts Amy to recall the Doctor and something he told {{her when she was}} seven during his rewind. She interrupts her father's speech, imploring the [...] "Raggedy" [...] Doctor from her memories to come back. As she recites the old wedding proverb ("something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue"), relating that to what the Doctor <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the TARDIS, the TARDIS and the Doctor appear. The Doctor comes out of the TARDIS and after a brief conversation with Amy, introduces himself by saying [...] "Hello everyone! I'm Amy's imaginary friend, but I came anyway!" [...] and joins the wedding festivities. Afterwards, he returns River's diary and the vortex manipulator to her so she can return to her own time. She sadly tells him he will soon learn who she truly is and that it will change everything. Aboard the TARDIS, the Doctor explains to Amy and Rory that unanswered questions remain about the destruction of the TARDIS and the nature of [...] "the silence" [...] that will fall. The Doctor receives a telephone call alerting him to the presence of [...] "an escaped Egyptian goddess on the Orient Express, in space". He tells them that this will have to be goodbye. They agree that it is goodbye and Amy leans out of the TARDIS and yells [...] "Goodbye!". The three then leave on their next adventure.|$|E

2500|$|Jerry Falwell opposed Islam. According to Asharq Al-Awsat, a pan-Arab newspaper, Falwell called Islam [...] "satanic". In a {{televised}} interview with 60 Minutes, Falwell called Muhammad a [...] "terrorist", {{to which he}} added: [...] "I concluded from reading Muslim and non-Muslim writers that Muhammad was a violent man, a man of war." [...] Falwell later apologized to Muslims for {{what he said about}} Muhammad and affirmed that he did not necessarily intend to offend [...] "honest and peace-loving" [...] Muslims. However, as he refused to remove his comments about Islam from his website, the sincerity of his apology was doubted. Egyptian Christian intellectuals, in response, signed a statement in which they condemned and rejected what Falwell <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> Muhammad being a terrorist.|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard is {{considered}} by some modern theologians to be the [...] "Father of Existentialism". Because of his influence {{and in spite of}} it, others only consider either Martin Heidegger or Jean-Paul Sartre to be the actual [...] "Father of Existentialism". Kierkegaard predicted his posthumous fame, and foresaw that his work would become the subject of intense study and research. In 1784 Immanuel Kant, many years before Kierkegaard, challenged the thinkers of Europe to think for themselves in a manner suggestive of Kierkegaard's philosophy in the nineteenth century. In 1851 Arthur Schopenhauer said the same as Kierkegaard <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the lack of realism in the reading public in Either/Or Part I and Prefaces. In 1854 Søren Kierkegaard wrote a note to [...] "My Reader" [...] of a similar nature.|$|E

It must be rejected by the Church as decisively as, if not more severely than [...] the Action Française, with which it shares some errors. But Rosenberg's doctrine is more imbued with negation and creates, above all in the youth, a hatred against Christianity greater than that of Nietzsche".|$|E

2500|$|Kaine {{announced}} {{his support for}} Senator Obama's presidential bid in February 2007. It was maintained that Kaine's endorsement was the first from a statewide elected official outside of Illinois.

Obama had supported Kaine in his campaign for governor and <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> him: [...] "Tim Kaine has a message of fiscal responsibility and generosity of spirit.

Ali {{went on to win the}} 12 round non-title affair by a decision. Ali took things further in the build-up to their last fight, The Thrilla in Manila, and called Frazier [...] "the other type of negro" [...] and [...] "ugly", [...] "dumb" [...] and a [...] "gorilla" [...] At one point he sparred with a man in a gorilla suit and pounded on a rubber gorilla doll, saying [...] "This is Joe Frazier's conscience...

2500|$|The third {{trial was}} a civil matter arising from an {{accusation}} made on 26 November by Victor de Carnières in his newspaper Colon français, that Abdeljelil Zaouche, a leading {{member of the}} Young Tunisians, had led the riots and paid individuals {{to take part in}} them. On 30 November Zaouche replied in his own newspaper, Le Tunisien, accusing Carnières of defamation. [...] After unsuccessful attempts to have these accusations dealt with by other administrative or judicial means, Zaouche brought a case against him. The case did not come before the court until 26 October 1912, after the criminal trials were over. Carnières' defence was that he was relying on rumours he had picked up from Tunisians. [...] The presiding judge described Zaouche as 'a man of good' and the Attorney General described his actions as worthy only of praise. Nevertheless the court simply dismissed the case on the grounds that anything damaging Carnières <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> Zaouche was only of secondary importance, and that his primary aim had been to defend French interests. The court also ruled that Zaouche should pay the costs of the action, which tended to support the view among colonists that the accusations were well-founded. Exonerated by the court, Carnières continued his attacks on Zaouche and the Young Tunisians in his newspaper. Zaouche pursued the matter at the Court of Appeal in Algiers, where Carnières' standing in the settler community in Tunis counted for less. The Algiers court found in Zaouche's favour and awarded him costs with interest against Carnières, taking into account his bad faith and his intention to defame. [...] However the court also decided, 'considering the circumstances' not to announce its decision in the Tunis newspapers, which meant that it went largely unnoticed.|$|E
