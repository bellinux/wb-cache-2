The place, the perfect June days and nights, (leaning toward crisp and cool,) the {{hospitality}} of J. and Mrs. B., the air, the fruit, (especially my favorite dish, currants and raspberries, mixed, sugar'd, fresh and ripe from the bushes--I pick 'em myself)--the room I occupy at night, the perfect bed, the window giving an ample view of the Hudson and the opposite shores, so wonderful toward sunset, and the rolling music of the RR. trains, far over there--the peaceful rest--the early Venus-heralded dawn--the noiseless splash of sunrise, the light and warmth indescribably glorious, in which, (soon as the sun is well up,) I have a capital rubbing and rasping with the flesh-brush--with an extra scour on the back by Al. J., who is here with us--all inspiriting my <b>invalid</b> <b>frame</b> with new life, for the day. Then, after some whiffs of morning air, the delicious coffee of Mrs. B., with the cream, strawberries, and many substantials, for breakfast.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Electrode {{disconnection}} is {{a common}} occurrence during long-term monitoring of brain electrical impedance tomography (EIT) in clinical settings. The data acquisition system suffers remarkable data loss which results in image reconstruction failure. The {{aim of this study}} was to: (1) detect disconnected electrodes and (2) account for invalid data. Methods Weighted correlation coefficient for each electrode was calculated based on the measurement differences between well-connected and disconnected electrodes. Disconnected electrodes were identified by filtering out abnormal coefficients with discrete wavelet transforms. Further, previously valid measurements were utilized to establish grey model. The <b>invalid</b> <b>frames</b> after electrode disconnection were substituted with the data estimated by grey model. The proposed approach was evaluated on resistor phantom and with eight patients in clinical settings. Results The proposed method was able to detect 1 or 2 disconnected electrodes with an accuracy of 100...|$|R

40|$|Telesonography {{involves}} {{transmission of}} ultrasound video from remote areas {{to the doctors}} for getting diagnosis. Due {{to the lack of}} trained sonographers in remote areas, the ultrasound videos scanned by these untrained persons do not contain the proper information that is required by a physician. As compared to standard methods for video transmission, mHealth driven systems need to be developed for transmitting valid medical videos. To overcome this problem, we are proposing an organ validation algorithm to evaluate the ultrasound video based on the content present. This will guide the semi skilled person to acquire the representative data from patient. Advancement in smartphone technology allows us to perform high medical image processing on smartphone. In this paper we have developed an Application (APP) for a smartphone which can automatically detect the valid frames (which consist of clear organ visibility) in an ultrasound video and ignores the <b>invalid</b> <b>frames</b> (which consist of no-organ visibility), and produces a compressed sized video. This is done by extracting the GIST features from the Region of Interest (ROI) of the frame and then classifying the frame using SVM classifier with quadratic kernel. The developed application resulted with the accuracy of 94. 93 % in classifying valid and invalid images...|$|R

These parameters include PLR [6], burst loss frequency (BLF) [8], and <b>invalid</b> <b>frame</b> ratio (IFR) [21]. In the existing work, these parameters and other video coding parameters like coding bitrate, frame rate, are modeled together. In order to fairly compare the performance of the above parameters that reflect transmission impairment, the coding artifacts are prevented by properly setting QP in our datasets.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a brief {{overview}} of a more extensive article recently published in Found. Phys. Lett. [2]. Apparent disagreement with experiment as well as internal inconsistencies found in the traditional analysis of relativistically rotating frames/disks are summarized. As one example, a point p at 0 degrees on the circumference of a rotating disk does not, according to the standard theory, exist at the same moment in time as the same point p at 360 degrees. This and other problems with the standard theory are completely resolved by a novel analysis that directly addresses, apparently for the first time, the non-time-orthogonal nature of rotating frames. Though ultimately consonant with the special and general theories of relativity, due to non-time-orthogonality, the analysis predicts several peculiar (i. e., not traditionally relativistic) results. For example, the local circumferential speed of light is not invariant (thereby agreeing with the Sagnac experiment), and no Lorentz contraction exists along the disk rim. Other experimental results, including time dilation, mass-energy dependence on speed, and what has heretofore been considered a "spurious" signal in the most accurate Michelson-Morley experiment performed to date, are accurately predicted. Further, the widely accepted postulate for the equivalence of co-moving inertial and non-inertial rods, used liberally with prior rotating frame analyses, is shown to be <b>invalid</b> for non-time-orthogonal <b>frames.</b> This understanding of the ramifications of non-time-orthogonality resolves paradoxes inherent in the traditional theory.

40|$|The {{rotating}} disk {{problem is}} analyzed {{on the premise}} that proper interpretation of experimental evidence leads {{to the conclusion that the}} postulates upon which relativity theory is based, particularly the invariance of the speed of light, are not applicable to rotating frames. Different postulates based on the Sagnac experiment are proposed, and from these postulates a new relativistic theory of rotating frames is developed following steps similar to those initially followed by Einstein for rectilinear motion. The resulting theory agrees with all experiments, resolves problems with the traditional approach to the rotating disk, and exhibits both traditionally relativistic and non-relativistic characteristics. Of particular note, no Lorentz contraction exists on the rotating disk circumference, and the disk surface, contrary to the assertions of Einstein and others, is found to be Riemann flat. The variable speed of light found in the Sagnac experiment is then shown to be characteristic of non-time-orthogonal reference frames, of which the rotating frame is one. In addition, the widely accepted postulate for the equivalence of inertial and non-inertial standard rods with zero relative velocity, used liberally in prior rotating disk analyses, is shown to be <b>invalid</b> for such <b>frames.</b> Further, the new theory stands alone in correctly predicting what was heretofore considered a "spurious" non-null effect on the order of 10 ^- 13 found by Brillet and Hall in the most accurate Michelson-Morley type test to date. The presentation is simple and pedagogic in order to make it accessible to the non-specialist. Key words: relativistic, rotating disk, Sagnac, rotating frame, non-time-orthogonal frame.
