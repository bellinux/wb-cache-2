40|$|Growth {{in trading}} without pre-trade transparency, ‘dark trading’, has caused {{considerable}} concern among regulators and exchanges worldwide about {{its impact on}} market quality. These concerns recently prompted Canadian regulators to implement novel restrictions on <b>dark</b> <b>trading.</b> We exploit this natural experiment, which reduced the level of <b>dark</b> <b>trading</b> {{by more than one}} third literally overnight, together with proprietary trade-level data from <b>dark</b> <b>trading</b> venues to examine the impact of <b>dark</b> <b>trading</b> on liquidity and informational efficiency. We find that low levels of <b>dark</b> <b>trading,</b> as exist in Canada, are largely beneficial, reducing quoted, effective and realized spreads and increasing informational efficiency. Our results are consistent with the notion that, to a point, <b>dark</b> <b>trading</b> increases competition among informed traders who seek to capture rents from liquidity provision while minimizing leakage of their information. We do not find any evidence that the Canadian restrictions caused migration of <b>dark</b> <b>trading</b> to the US in cross-listed stocks...|$|E

40|$|Today traders {{are faced}} with an {{increasing}} number of possibilities to hide their trading intentions. In general these options can be classified into two broad categories: (1) hidden orders on otherwise lit trading venues, and (2) completely <b>dark</b> <b>trading</b> venues. Our paper investigates the relation between both types of opaque trading. Using a detailed high-frequency dataset, we first show that hidden and <b>dark</b> <b>trading</b> are substitutes: an increase in hidden order trading implies reduced <b>dark</b> <b>trading</b> and vice versa. Second, we show that volatility and imbalanced trading drive the segmentation of trading activity into a visible and an opaque part. Third, we identify market quality variables (spread and visible depth) that drive opaque trading activity either to hidden orders on lit venues or to <b>dark</b> <b>trading</b> venues. Finally, we document a strong positive relation between the fraction of hidden order trading on several alternative lit trading venues...|$|E

Price discovery and <b>dark</b> <b>trading</b> [...] 5. Joint impact of fragmentation and algorithmic trading on market quality [...] 6. Conclusions. This thesis examines the combined effect of algorithmic trading and market fragmentation on market quality. Three distinct but inter-related research studies are conducted {{and the ultimate}} findings of the thesis are three fold. First, exchange listed companies can use stock splits to manage their tick size and influence the level of algorithmic market making in their security, which can subsequently impact the company’s liquidity. Stock splits alter a security’s relative tick size. In some cases, this change in relative tick size increases the quoted spread captured by market makers. This extra incentive improves liquidity and reduces transaction costs. Companies that undertake stock splits while already tick constrained increase the profit of market makers {{at the cost of}} liquidity takers. Second, the research shows that <b>dark</b> <b>trading</b> contributes very little to the price discovery of a market. Further, regulation that reduces the level of <b>dark</b> <b>trading</b> in a market does not impact the relative competitiveness in price discovery for cross listed assets. Third, the thesis examines the joint impact of fragmentation and algorithmic trading. Findings show that on exchange fragmentation increases market competition and reduced transaction costs, with two side effects: the joint growth of dark fragmentation and algorithmic trading. <b>Dark</b> <b>trading</b> reduces integrity by adding an alternate venue with lesser price impact, while algorithmic trading increases both market efficiency and integrity.

This paper evaluates the impact of <b>dark</b> <b>trading</b> and fragmentation in visible order books on liquidity. We consider global liquidity by consolidating the limit order books of all visible trading venues, and local liquidity by considering the traditional market only.

40|$|Two {{important}} {{characteristics of}} current European equity markets {{are rooted in}} changes in financial regulation (the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive).

This paper evaluates the impact on liquidity of fragmentation in visible order books and <b>dark</b> <b>trading</b> for a sample of 52 Dutch stocks.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} ASICs minimum price improvement rule implementation on <b>dark</b> <b>trading</b> and {{the impact on the}} efficiency of Australians pre-trade transparent market for ASX listed cash equities. ASIC implemented meaningful price improvement a regulatory market design change on 26 May 2013 forcing dark-venue trades to offer at-least-one-tick-improvement on prevailing-NBBO-quote. Pre-trade transparent (lit market) and dark markets differ based on their regulatory structures. Lit markets offer pre-trade transparency and fair-access whilst dark venues are pre-trade transparency exempt, and do not offer full and fair access to their order book. I construct a 2 SLS framework to model determinants of <b>dark</b> <b>trading</b> and use <b>dark</b> <b>trading</b> as an instrument to examine its effect and impact on market efficiency and market liquidity ex ante and ex post ASICs exogenous regulatory event. I find evidence of a decrease in asymmetric information ex post rule implementation and present evidence of decreased round trip costs of execution within the lit market after ASIC implemented meaningful price improvement. I argue the decrease in transaction costs not only evidence the rules positive effect on motivating liquidity providers to transact on the informed lit-market by influencing both informed and uninformed order flow to be less segmented, but also evidences improved market efficiency and market liquidity conditions of the Australian cash equities market. My results findings inform public debate as market operators and regulators around the world continue to expend significant financial, process, systems and people resources in an attempt to enhance market efficiency as well as identify, detect, investigate and prosecute market manipulation. Regulators will continue to be called upon to make regulatory market design changes or maintain current regulation; whichever best achieves the regulators goals of increasing market efficiency, market integrity and systemic risk...|$|E
40|$|We exploit a {{regulatory}} discontinuity {{in the minimum}} pricing increment, or tick size, to explore the mechanism by which tick size regulations benefit “dark ” trading venues {{at the expense of}} traditional stock exchanges and the associated effects on displayed liquidity and price discovery. Under Rule 612 of Regulation NMS, orders priced at or above $ 1. 00 per share are required to be priced in penny increments, while all other orders can be quoted in subpennies. Using all trading data from 2011 - 2013, our regression discontinuity analysis of this $ 1. 00 cut-off confirms that the penny tick size facilitates “queue-jumping ” of exchanges by dark pools; however, we show that the most significant portion of such queue-jumping occurs by means of trades at the midpoint of the NBBO—a form of trading that is generally considered to have significant benefits for institutional investors. Further, while queue-jumping in dark venues is associated with a significant decrease in the quantity of displayed liquidity on public exchanges, we show that the largest effect is on liquidity providers utilizing high frequency trading (HFT) algorithms, thus revealing an important inverse relation between <b>dark</b> <b>trading</b> and HFT. Finally, notwithstanding the drop in displayed liquidity associated with <b>dark</b> <b>trading,...</b>|$|E

This study contributes to the understanding of factors that influence traders' preference to transact through an exchange operated dark pool and the execution probability of dark orders. We also examine the impact of Centre Point <b>dark</b> pool <b>trading</b> on market quality. The results show that the level of trading activity in the dark pool is higher for larger stocks with lower prices. Dark pool's share of total volume is higher when quoted spreads are wider, best depth is thicker, and when order imbalance, volatility and adverse selection are lower in the central limit order book. Execution probability of Centre Point orders increases when <b>dark</b> pool <b>trading</b> is most active and when average Centre Point order size is greater.
