The shrinking of glaciers, which are the main source of water of Himalayan rivers, can have an adverse impact on the future of hydro-power projects, many of which may become non-functional during next 40 - 50 years if the current trend of melting of glaciers continues and the other renewable energy sources are required to be tapped to supplement the declining hydro-electricity generation. The energy consumption for cooking, lighting and space heating in the Western Himalayan Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, is highest in the northern India. The fuelwood consumption constitutes about 52 % of the total energy consumption of the state. About 2. 7 Â h per person per trip in the rural areas, are spent for the collection of fuelwood mainly during winters. A number of options and potential of renewable energy sources for cooking, heating and lighting in the state have been discussed. The future policy interventions in the energy sector are also presented. Renewable energy technologies Global warming Energy...|$|E
40|$|Mit zunehmender Miniaturisierung mikroelektronischer Bauelemente steigen die Anforderungen an reproduzierbare qualitätskonforme Schichten. Um die zur Herstellung notwendigen ALD/PVD/CVD-Schichtabscheideanlagen in einen zuverlässigen Zustand zu versetzen, ist eine regelmäßige Kammerreinigung notwendig. Während des Abscheideprozesses werden nicht nur das Substrat, sondern auch die umliegenden Kammerteile beschichtet. Diese Schichten wachsen mit jedem Beschichtungszyklus weiter an. Der Stress zwischen Schicht und Kammerwand steigt beständig, und es besteht das Risiko das Teile abplatzen und auf die Waferoberfläche fallen und damit die Struktur unbrauchbar machen. Um das zu verhindern, muss die Kammerwand in einen regelmäßigen Zustand versetzt werden, in dem sichergestellt ist, daß keine Schichtreste abplatzen können. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird ein neues Verfahren zur Trockenreinigung von ALD-Titannitrid Kammern vorgestellt. Dazu wurden TiN-Stücke (hergestellt im ALD, CVD, PVD-Verfahren) auf einem temperaturgeregelten Probenhalter platziert. Eine Argon/NF 3 Gasmischung wurde in einer externen Plasmaquelle (RPS) zerlegt und in die Reaktionskammer geschleust. Die Ätzung wurde mit in-situ Reflexionsmessung beobachtet. Experimente mit Chlorzugabe wurden unternommen und ein starker Einfluss auf den Ätzmechanismus beobachtet. Die Ätzraten des TiN sind exponentiell abhängig von der Temperatur und {{proportional}} abhängig von der Verfügbarkeit atomaren Fluors. Dieses wird bei der Zerlegung von NF 3 frei gesetzt und steht der Reaktion zur Verfügung. Die NF 3 -Zerlegung in Fluor und Stickstoff wurde mit Hilfe der Massenspektrometrie (QMS) untersucht, Zerlegungsgrade größer 96 % wurden erreicht. Mit Hilfe dieser Messung kann der Einfluss der Kammerreinigung auf den Treibhausgasausstoß (GWP) bestimmt werden. Mit dem Ar/NF 3 -Verfahren können die GWP-Emissionen um 90 % im Vergleich zur RIE-Ätzung mit SF 6 reduziert werden. Mit Argon/Chlor-Plasmen konnte kein Titannitrid geätzt werden, da die physikalische Sputterkomponente fehlte. Durch Hinzufügen von Chlor zu einer Ar/NF 3 -Gasmischung konnte die Ätzrate um bis zu 270 % im Bereich niedrige Temperaturen/niedriger Druck gesteigert werden. Bei höheren Temperaturen/höherem Druck fielen die Ar/NF 3 /Chlor Ätzraten allerdings deutlich hinter die des Ar/NF 3 zurück. Die dazu führenden Effekte werden untersucht und ausgeführt. Die Nutzung von externen Plasmaquellen bietet eine vielversprechende Alternative um Abscheideanlagen von TiN-Rückständen reinigen zu können. Bei hohen Temperaturen werden deutlich höhere Ätzraten als bei anderen Schichten (SiN, SiO 2, W) erreicht. Für Anwendungen im niedrigen Temperaturbereich erlaubt die Zugabe von Chlor interessante Anwendungsmöglichkeiten. Demands {{on state}} of the art deposition technologies for semiconductor production focus on uniformity, repeatability and low defectivity. The chamber condition is a key parameter to achieve these high demands in chemical vapour deposition (CVD) processes and are even more critical to the atomic layer deposition processes (ALD). During the deposition process not only the wafer surface but other chamber parts as well are covered with a thin film. This film accumulates during the deposition cycles and is prone to fall off the walls and pollute the wafer surface. The chamber parts that are exposed to the deposition must be set back to a steady state so that no deposits fall off the walls. The chamber condition also changes uncontrolled with varying film condition on the wall. A new approach for cleaning of ALD-titanium nitride (TiN) deposition chambers was investigated. To determine etch rates TiN-samples (created by ALD, CVD and PVD) were placed on a temperature controlled sample holder. An argon/NF 3 mixture was excited in an upstream remote plasma source (RPS) and then routed through the reaction chamber. No further plasma activation inside the reaction chamber was done. The etching was monitored by in-situ reflectometry and etch rates were calculated. The effect of chlorine addition was also studied and strong influence on etch rates was found. The etch rate of TiN is dependent exponentially on temperature and very low etch rates were achieved below 70 ◦C at a chamber pressure ranging from 20 - 300 Pa. It was found that this correlates very well with the vapour pressure of the reaction product TiF 4. At temperatures of 300 ◦C etch rates up to 800 nm/min were achieved. The optimum pressure for etching was found at 100 Pa while the pressure effect was small. The etch rate was mainly dependent on the availability of activated fluorine to create TiF 4 by the reaction 2 NF 3 → N 2 + 6 F* 2 TiN + 8 F* → 2 TiF 4 + N 2 The NF 3 decomposition to nitrogen and fluorine was monitored by quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS) and was found to be greater than 96 %. This figure allows an estimation of the amount of Global warm potential (GWP) gas <b>emmited</b> <b>by</b> the process for environmental considerations. Using argon/NF 3 or argon/fluorine mixtures in RPS devices reduces the GWP emissions by more than 90 % compared to RIE plasma cleaning with SF 6. No etching occurred by using argon/chlorine only mixtures as no physical etch component was involved in RPS etch. However adding chlorine to the argon/NF 3 mixture accelerated the etching process. Chlorine addition to the argon/NF 3 mixture increased the etch rates up to 270 % in the low pressure/low temperature regime. At higher temperatures or higher pressures the etch rates dropped below the etch rates achieved solely with fluorine chemistry. It must be emphasized that there is no physical acceleration of the ionized molecules toward the etched sample in this remote plasma setup. The usage of a remote plasma offers an alternative way to remove residues from chambers running TiN deposition processes. At high temperatures the Ar/NF 3 offers remarkably high etching rates for TiN compared to other films (silicon nitride, -oxide, tungsten) usually cleaned by remote plasma. For low temperature applications the chlorine enhancement offers an interesting alternative to accelerate the etch process...|$|E
