The corner kick was taken short and the eventual cross was headed behind for another corner {{on the opposite side}} by Evra. The second corner was crossed in towards Piqué, but he was unable to make contact with the ball.|$|E
5|$|At 0:35, {{the camera}} {{cuts to the}} {{aftermath}} of The Shot. A young man jumps {{in the air and}} pumps his fist as another young man in an opposing jersey sinks to the floor. The moment is from the 1989 NBA Playoffs, when Jordan hit a game-winning jump shot over Cleveland Cavaliers guard Craig Ehlo. At 0:38 is Jordan's last shot with the Chicago Bulls, after a crossover <b>dribble</b> past Utah Jazz guard Bryon Russell at the end of Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals. These scenes are musically punctuated with a bass drum roll and a cymbal crash. Finally, at 0:44 a young man shrugs after hitting a shot, as Jordan shrugged after scoring six three-point field goals {{in the first half of}} Game 1 of the 1992 NBA Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers.|$|E

A police constable administered first aid before the player, whose leg was broken, was carried from the field on a plank and taken to hospital. On a heavy pitch in poor condition, it was nearly impossible to <b>dribble</b> the ball, and Small Heath's decision to play on with only one back meant Darwen's attackers were frequently caught offside.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} title game against Georgetown was evenly matched throughout. However, with 17 seconds {{left on the}} clock, and the Tar Heels behind by 1 point, Jordan made what ended up being the game-winning shot to put the Tar Heels up 63-62. On Georgetown's ensuing possession, Hoya guard Fred Brown mistakenly passed the ball to Worthy. Worthy attempted to <b>dribble</b> out the clock, but was fouled with 2 seconds left. He missed both free throws, but Georgetown had no timeouts left. The Hoyas missed a halfcourt shot as time expired, giving Smith his first national championship in his seventh appearance in the Final Four.|$|E
5|$|Born in Dallas, Texas, to Noel and Freida Bosh, Chris Bosh {{grew up in}} Hutchins, Texas. A family-oriented person, Bosh often played {{basketball}} {{in the house with}} his younger brother, Joel. By four years of age, he began learning how to <b>dribble</b> a basketball in the gym, where his dad played pick-up games. Although Bosh was always tall since youth and this allowed him to out-rebound others in basketball games, he only started learning the game around fourth grade at a playground near his grandmother's house. Apart from basketball, Bosh also played baseball up until high school, preferring to play as a first baseman. Growing up, Bosh names his parents as the biggest influences on his personality and considered NBA superstar Kevin Garnett as his favorite athlete, modeling his play after him. Academically, Bosh always did well in school, but he began to garner significant attention from college recruiters when he led Lincoln High School in Dallas to the number one ranking in the country and the USA Today National Championship with a perfect 40–0 season.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Ball <b>dribbling</b> is {{a central}} element of {{basketball}} and one main challenge for realizing basketball robots is to achieve {{the stability of the}} periodic <b>dribbling</b> task. In this paper two control designs for ball <b>dribbling</b> with an industrial robot are compared. For the two strategies, the ball position is determined either through force/torque or visual sensor feedback and the ball trajectory is predicted with a recursive least squares algorithm. The end effector trajectory for each <b>dribbling</b> cycle is generated based on the predicted ball position/velocity at the <b>dribbling</b> height and the estimated coefficient of restitution. For both tracking approaches, <b>dribbling</b> for multiple cycles is achieved. The vision-based approach performs better as compared to the force/torque-based approach, in particular for imprecise estimates of the coefficient of restitution...|$|R

5|$|In the Champions League, Messi scored {{twice and}} {{assisted}} on another in their 3–0 semi-final victory over Bayern Munich, {{now under the}} stewardship of Guardiola. His second goal, which came only three minutes after his first, saw him chip the ball over goalkeeper Manuel Neuer after his <b>dribble</b> past Jérôme Boateng had made the defender drop to the ground; it went viral, becoming the year's most tweeted about sporting moment, and was named the best goal of the season by UEFA. Despite a second-leg loss, Barcelona progressed to the final on 6 June in Berlin, where they defeated Juventus 3–1 to win their second treble, becoming the first team in history to do so. Although Messi did not score, he participated {{in each of his}} side's goals, particularly the second as he forced a parried save from goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon from which Suárez scored the match-winning goal on the rebound. In addition to being the top assist provider with six assists, Messi finished the competition as the joint top scorer with ten goals, which earned him the distinction of being the first player ever to achieve the top scoring mark in five Champions League seasons. For his efforts during the season, he received the UEFA Best Player in Europe award for a second time.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the season, Barcelona played four Clásicos in {{the span}} of 18 days. A league match on 16 April ended in a draw after a penalty from Messi. After Barcelona lost the Copa del Rey final four days later, Messi scored both goals in his side's 2–0 win in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals, the second of which – a <b>dribble</b> past three players – was {{acclaimed}} {{as one of the best}} ever in the competition. Although he did not score, he was again important in the second-leg draw that sent Barcelona through to the Champions League final, where they faced Manchester United in a repeat of the final two years earlier. As the competition's top scorer for the third consecutive year, with 12 goals, Messi gave a man-of-the-match performance at Wembley on 28 May, scoring the match-winning goal of Barça's 3–1 victory. Barcelona won a third consecutive La Liga title. In addition to his 31 goals, Messi was also the league's top assist provider with 18. He finished the season with 53 goals and 24 assists in all competitions, becoming Barcelona's all-time single-season top scorer and the first player in Spanish football to reach the 50-goal benchmark.|$|E
5|$|The Bulls {{returned}} to the Delta Center for Game 6 on June 14, 1998, leading the series 3–2. Jordan executed a series of plays, considered {{to be one of}} the greatest clutch performances in NBA Finals history. With the Bulls trailing 86–83 with 41.9 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, Phil Jackson called a timeout. When play resumed, Jordan received the inbound pass, drove to the basket, and hit a shot over several Jazz defenders, cutting the Utah lead to 86–85. The Jazz brought the ball upcourt and passed the ball to forward Karl Malone, who was set up in the low post and was being guarded by Rodman. Malone jostled with Rodman and caught the pass, but Jordan cut behind him and took the ball out of his hands for a steal. Jordan then dribbled down the court and paused, eyeing his defender, Jazz guard Bryon Russell. With 10 seconds remaining, Jordan started to <b>dribble</b> right, then crossed over to his left, possibly pushing off Russell, although the officials did not call a foul. With 5.2 seconds left, Jordan gave Chicago an 87–86 lead with a game-winning jumper, the climactic shot of his Bulls career. Afterwards, John Stockton missed a game-winning three-pointer. Jordan and the Bulls won their sixth NBA championship and second three-peat. Once again, Jordan was voted the Finals MVP, having led all scorers averaging 33.5 points per game, including 45 in the deciding Game 6. Jordan's six Finals MVPs is a record; Shaquille O'Neal, Magic Johnson, LeBron James and Tim Duncan are tied for second place with three apiece. The 1998 Finals holds the highest television rating of any Finals series in history. Game 6 also holds the highest television rating of any game in NBA history.|$|E
40|$|Previously, we have {{documented}} that isolated autophagosomes from tumor cells could efficiently cross-prime tumor-reactive naı̈ve T cells and mediate tumor regression in preclinical mouse models. However, {{the effect of}} tumor-derived autophagosomes, here we refer as to <b>DRibbles,</b> on B cells has not been studied so far. At present study, we found that <b>DRibbles</b> generated from a murine hepatoma cell line Hep 1 - 6, induced B-cell activation after intravenous injection into mice. B-cell populations were significantly expanded {{and the production of}} Hep 1 - 6 tumor-specific antibodies was successfully induced. Moreover, in vitro studies showed that <b>DRibbles</b> could induce more efficient B-cell proliferation and activation, antibody production, and cytokine secretion than whole tumor cell lysates. Notably, we found that B-cell activation required proteins but not DNA in the <b>DRibbles.</b> We further showed that B cells could capture <b>DRibbles</b> and present antigens in the <b>DRibbles</b> to directly induce T cell activation. Furthermore, we found that B-cell activation, antibody production, cytokine secretion and antigen cross-presentation were TLR 2 -MyD 88 pathway dependent.

50|$|<b>Dribbling</b> is {{bouncing}} {{the ball}} continuously {{with one hand}} at a time without ever holding the ball. <b>Dribbling</b> is required {{in order for a}} player to take steps while possessing the ball.|$|R
25|$|There {{are limits}} {{placed on the}} steps a player may take without dribbling, which {{commonly}} results in an infraction known as traveling. Nor may a player stop his <b>dribble</b> and then resume dribbling. A <b>dribble</b> that touches both hands is considered stopping the <b>dribble,</b> giving this infraction the name double <b>dribble.</b> Within a <b>dribble,</b> the player cannot carry the ball by placing {{his hand on the}} bottom of the ball; doing so is known as carrying the ball. A team, once having established ball control in the front half of their court, may not return the ball to the backcourt and be the first to touch it. A violation of these rules results in loss of possession.|$|E
25|$|When {{dribbling}} past an opponent, the dribbler should <b>dribble</b> {{with the}} hand farthest from the opponent, {{making it more difficult}} for the defensive player to get to the ball. It is therefore important for a player to be able to <b>dribble</b> competently with both hands.|$|E
25|$|The first defender should {{usually be}} the player {{closest to the}} {{opponent}} holding possession, but needs {{to be at the}} defending side of him in order to do an effective job. He or she should keep a distance of about 2 metres, although the ideal distance will vary with each situation. The point is to pressure the opponent as much as possible without giving him a large possibility of a <b>dribble.</b> As a <b>dribble</b> isn't as dangerous when the defending team is well organised, the distance may be shorter in these cases. Analogously, the distance should be increased if the defence is poorly organised.|$|E
40|$|Background/Objective: This {{research}} examines {{whether or}} not the Yo-Yo testing performance could reflect the repeatability of high-intensity intermittent <b>dribbling</b> in adolescent basketball players. Methods: Thirty-six teenage basketball players aged 13 – 18 years were invited to participate in this study. Results: A test–retest showed that the Yo-Yo intermittent endurance Level 2 (IE 2) test with <b>dribbling</b> (intraclass correlation coefficient =  0. 92; coefficient of variation =  12. 6 %; d =  0. 24) and without <b>dribbling</b> (intraclass correlation coefficient =  0. 83; coefficient of variation =  15. 0 %; d =  0. 37) had acceptable reliability. The <b>dribbling</b> distance covered was significantly shorter than was the running performance of the Yo-Yo IE 2 test in participants younger than 15 years (junior; 1138  ±  417  m vs. 910  ±  299  m, p    0. 05; d =  0. 35). Moderate to large correlations were found between running and <b>dribbling</b> performances in the senior sample (r =  0. 57, p =  0. 06), the junior sample (r =  0. 87, p <  0. 01), and the whole (r =  0. 72, p <  0. 01) sample, respectively.
