On the other hand, species in the genus Xeniaria (still of the suborder Arixeniina) are believed to feed on the guano and possibly the guanophilous arthropods in the bat's nest, where it has been found.

The hindwing is a very thin membrane that expands like a fan, radiating from one point folded under the forewing.

50|$|Coralline algae are {{widespread}} {{in all of}} the world's oceans, where they often cover close to 100% of rocky substrata. Only one species, Pneophyllum cetinaensis, is found in freshwater. Many are epiphytic (grow on other algae or marine angiosperms), or <b>epizoic</b> (grow on animals), and some are even parasitic on other corallines. Despite their ubiquity, the coralline algae are poorly known by ecologists, and even by specialist phycologists (people who study algae). For example, a recent book on the seaweeds of Hawaii does not include any crustose coralline algae, even though corallines are quite well studied there and dominate many marine areas.|$|E

From 93, 916 organisms belonging to 172 species, 5, 331 were Crepidula, the most abundant among sessile species. Also, Crepidula constitutes a substratum to attachment of Amphiroa, accounting for 30 % of total phytal area. There was a positive correlation between the growth of shell and <b>epizoic</b> alga. Higher level of the phytal belt was more suitable for attachment and/or growth of the <b>epizoic</b> alga, without influence from water movement or season of the year. This association depends on the external morphology of the shell, filter-feeding habit, high adhesive power and lacking of mechanisms avoiding attachment of epizoics of Crepidula.

40|$|Here, {{we present}} a study {{regarding}} the phylogenetic positions of two enigmatic earwig lineages whose unique phenotypic traits evolved in connection with ectoparasitic relationships with mammals. Extant earwigs (Dermaptera) have traditionally been divided into three suborders: the Hemimerina, Arixeniina, and Forficulina. While the Forficulina are typical, well-known, free-living earwigs, the Hemimerina and Arixeniina are unusual <b>epizoic</b> groups living on molossid bats (Arixeniina) or murid rodents (Hemimerina). The monophyly of both <b>epizoic</b> lineages is well established, but {{their relationship to the}} remainder of the Dermaptera is controversial because of their extremely modified morphology with paedomorphic features. We present phylogenetic analyses that include molecular data (18 S and 28 S ribosomal DNA and histone- 3) for both Arixeniina and Hemimerina for the first time. This data set enabled us to apply a rigorous cladistics approach and to test competing hypotheses that were previously scattered in the literature. Our results demonstrate that Arixeniidae and Hemimeridae belong in the dermapteran suborder Neodermaptera, infraorder Epidermaptera, and superfamily Forficuloidea. The results support the sister group relationships of Arixeniidae+Chelisochidae and Hemimeridae+Forficulidae. This study demonstrates the potential for rapid and substantial macroevolutionary changes at the morphological level as related to adaptive evolution, in this case linked to the utilization of a novel trophic niche based on an <b>epizoic</b> life strategy. Our results also indicate that the evolutionary consequences of the transition to an ectoparazitic mode of living, which is extremely rar...|$|E

40|$|Sixty {{specimens}} {{of the giant}} marine isopod Glyptonotus antarcticus Eights, collected from Borge Bay, Signy Island, Antarctica were examined for epizoans. Ten species of cheilostomatid bryozoans {{were found on the}} isopods. The {{purpose of the study was}} to quantify the prevalence, intensity, abundance, and spatial distribution of the bryozoans on the isopods. The proportion of isopods colonized was 42 %. The larger isopods had both significantly more <b>epizoic</b> bryozoan colonies and species. The greatest density of bryozoans was on the fused pleon and telson. There was no significant difference between the dorsal and ventral abundance of bryozoan colonies. The diversity of <b>epizoic</b> bryozoans on the isopods is higher than on other host organisms from more stable environments. This may be because of active selection by settling larvae.

A complex diatom community was present in every sample. In total, 11 macro-faunal and 21 diatom taxa were recorded. Amongst diatoms, the most numerous were erect (Achnanthes spp., Tripterion spp.) and motile (Haslea sp., Navicula spp., Nitzschia spp., Proschkinia sp.) forms, followed by adnate Amphora spp., while the most common macro-faunal species was Stomatolepas elegans (Cirripedia). Diatom densities ranged from 8179 ยฑ 750 to 27685 ยฑ 4885 cells mm- 2. <b>Epizoic</b> microalgae were either partly immersed or entirely encapsulated within an exopolymeric coat.

40|$|Bryozoan skeletons are a {{dominant}} constituent of cool-wa-ter carbonate sediments in the Cenozoic of southern Austra-lia. The primary substrate on {{much of the}} modern continen-tal shelf is loose sediment that is reworked intermittently to 200 m water depth by storm waves. Availability of stable substrate is a limiting factor in the modern distribution of bryozoans in this setting. As a result, a significant propor-tion of the sedimentologically important modern bryozoans (30 โ 250 m water depth) live attached to sessile, benthic in-vertebrate hosts that possess organic or spicular skeletons. Hosts such as hydroids, ascidian tunicates, sponges, soft worm tubes, octocorals, and other lightly-calcified and ar-ticulated bryozoans provide ephemeral substrates; after death, host skeletons disarticulate and decay, leaving little or no body fossil record. The calcareous sediments produced by these <b>epizoic</b> bryo-zoans from ephemeral substrates result in loose particles that rarely preserve substratal relationships, but potential-ly retain diagnostic basal attachment morphologies. Al-though the best known examples of <b>epizoic</b> carbonate pro-duction on ephemeral substrates are from the southern Aus-tralian margin, this {{may be an important}} phenomenon both globally and in the fossil record.

Recent analyses of syndermatan phylogeny suggested paraphyly of Eurotatoria (free-living bdelloids and monogononts) {{with respect to}} endoparasitic acanthocephalans. Data of <b>epizoic</b> seisonids, however, were absent, which may have affected the branching order within the syndermatan clade. Moreover, the position of Seisonidea within Syndermata should help in understanding the evolution of acanthocephalan endoparasitism. Here, we report the first phylogenomic analysis that includes all four higher-ranked groups of Syndermata. The analyzed data sets comprise new transcriptome data for Seison spec. (Seisonidea), Brachionus manjavacas (Monogononta), Adineta vaga (Bdelloidea), and Paratenuisentis ambiguus (Acanthocephala). Maximum likelihood and Bayesian trees {{for a total of}} 19 metazoan species were reconstructed from up to 410 functionally diverse proteins.

Our results support monophyly of Syndermata, Hemirotifera (Bdelloidea + Seisonidea + Acanthocephala), and Pararotatoria (Seisonidea + Acanthocephala), rejecting monophyly of traditional Rotifera and Eurotatoria.
