40|$|In the German Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change hail is {{identified}} {{as one of the}} major subjects of concern regarding transport infrastructure. Moreover hailstorms are a major threat to e. g. agriculture and the automobile industry causing significant economical damages and losses. Despite these significant hail-related meteorological risks no comprehensive observation-based hail climatology for Germany exists. In this study we present a new approach to this task, combining radar data with different kinds of hail reports, such as ground observation and agricultural insurance data. Preprocessing ensures the applicability of the radar data for the presented climatological analysis. In this sense a number of detection methods are applied to filter artefacts, especially clutter pixels and spokes that disrupt radar measurements. To construct a reliable hail climatology for Germany we process all information into a 10 ‑year based annual average number of hail days on a 1 km× 1 km 1 km× 1 km grid using a two-path hail criterion. While the first path combines a threshold of 50 [*]dBZ with a <b>hail</b> <b>report,</b> the second path is based on a 55 [*]dBZ threshold only. By adding radar data we increase the spatial representativity of the ground based hail reports and gain additional information in regions which lack observational data. Overall, the results are mainly determined by events derived from the first path (68 [*]...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{attempts}} to mitigate hail damage have {{focused primarily on}} protective efforts, such as insurance programs, which require long-term planning. Very {{little research has been}} done to determine what actions can be taken to prevent hail damage just before it occurs. In this study, <b>hail</b> <b>reports</b> taken from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) Storm Events Database were compared with NWS warnings for Colorado, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, and South Carolina during the years of 1999 - 2008. Warning accuracy and average lead time were determined for all <b>hail</b> <b>reports</b> during 1999 and 2000 as well as damaging <b>hail</b> <b>reports</b> between 1999 and 2008. It was found that in general, under the county warning system, sufficient lead time existed for mitigating action by the public. While less than 50 % of NWS Severe Thunderstorm Warnings resulted in <b>hail</b> <b>reports,</b> it is likely that many hail events were not reported in the NCDC data base. Using data from the Severe Hail Verification Experiment (SHAVE), an average hail swath size of 863 square kilometers (333. 2 square miles) was calculated from 14 hail swaths across the United States. The average polygon warning size covered more area than the average hail swath size, while county warnings covered a much larger area and would prompt an unnecessary number of people to take mitigating action. There are serious limitations as to the data sources available to make decisions for damage mitigation. A more thorough, more accurate data base would improve the economic cost-benefit analysis of various possible mitigation methods...|$|R

40|$|Very large hail {{is known}} as a {{presence}} of a hailstone greater or equal to 5 cm in diameter. This phenomenon is rare but its significant consequences, not only to agriculture but also to automobiles, households and people outdoor makes it essential thing to examine. Hail appearance is strictly connected with storms frequency and its kind. The most hail-endangered kind of storm is supercell storm. Geographical distribution of hailstorms was compared with geographical distribution of storms in Poland. Similarities were found. The area of the largest number of storms is southeastern Poland. Analyzed European Severe Weather Database (ESWD) data showed that most of very large <b>hail</b> <b>reports</b> occurred in this part of Poland. The probable reason for this situation is the longest period of lasting tropical airmasses in southeastern Poland. Spatial distribution analysis shows also more hail incidents over Upper Silesia, Lesser Poland, Subcarpathia and Świętokrzyskie regions. The information source about hail occurrence was ESWD - open database, where everyone can add report and find reports which meet given search criteria. 69 hailstorms in the period of 2007 - 2015 were examined. They caused 121 very large <b>hail</b> <b>reports.</b> It was found that there is large disproportion in number of hailstorms and <b>hail</b> <b>reports</b> between individual years. Very large hail season in Poland begins in May and ends in September with cumulation in July. Most of hail occurs between 12 : 00 and 17 : 00 UTC, but there were some cases of very large (one extremely large) hail at night and early morning hours. However very large hail is a spectacular phenomenon, its local character determines potentially high information loss rate and it is the most significant problem in hail research...|$|R

The intensities on the 1.5 km height CAPPI are over 47 dBZ which represents rain rates of 40 mm per hour or more. Three times, these intensities reached above 7 km, indicating the possibility of severe downbursts and hail.

40|$|A five-year {{climatology}} of elevated severe convective storms {{was constructed}} for the calendar years 1983 – 1987 from {{east of the}} Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic coast. Of the 1689 surface boundaries examined, 129 (8 %) were associated with elevated severe storm events. Of the 1066 severe reports associated with the 129 elevated severe storm events, 624 (58 %) were <b>hail</b> <b>reports,</b> 396 (37 %) were wind reports, and 46 (4 %) were tornado reports. A maximum of elevated severe storm events occurred in May with a secondary maximum in September. Elevated severe storm events vary geographically throughout the year with a maximum along the Gulf coast in winter to a High Plains maximum in spring and summer. The diurnal maximum of elevated severe storm events occurred at 2100 UTC, which coincided with the diurnal maximum of <b>hail</b> <b>reports.</b> The wind reports had no pronounced diurnal maximum. Elevated severe storm wind-only events occur roughly five times a year and are difficult to forecast. To examine the conditions associated with events that produced severe winds only, five cases were examined in more detail. These cases consisted of three environments (Type A, B, and C). Type A events were characterized by strongly forced elevated squall lines. Type B events were elevated isolated cellular events, whereas Type C events were elevated northwest flow events. Several questions remain unanswered about elevated severe storm wind-only events such as: Does the strength or depth of the inversion matter? What factors affect the transfer of momentum down to the surface...|$|R
50|$|The tornado {{outbreak}} of March 6-7, 2017 was a widespread severe weather and tornado outbreak that affected {{portions of the}} Midwestern United States in the overnight hours of March 6-7. Occurring just days after a deadly and more significant event across similar areas just a week prior, this particular outbreak led to 63 tornadoes within a 9-hour period as a quasi-linear convective system and discrete supercell thunderstorms traversed the region. The most notable aspect of the outbreak was an EF3 tornado that damaged or destroyed hundreds of structures within Oak Grove, Missouri, injuring 12 people but causing no fatalities. An EF1 tornado touched down near Bricelyn, the earliest known tornado on record {{in the state of}} Minnesota.

40|$|A {{study was}} made of the 3163 replies to the {{question}} of continuity during hailfall on all <b>hail</b> <b>reports</b> obtained from non-trained voluntary observers and by personal surveys during the 1963 hail season in Central Alberta, {{in order to determine the}} nature of hailstorms. The hailswath of the July 14 major storm featured very large hail in two small areas, and regions of rain-but-no-hail embedded within the swath. The largest hail was related to several small and intense radar echoes, during the first 22 minutes of their existence. Data indicate that Alberta hailstorms appear more or less continuous when studied on a coarse scale; however, when data are available on a finer scale, intermittency becomes evident, which points to the conclusion that hailstorms are composed of a number of small, individual, hail-producing cells acting together within storms.

50|$|By 4pm, the Perth {{storm had}} reached the {{southern}} suburbs and damaging wind gusts had been reported at the suburb of Jandakot (96 km/h). Jarrahdale, to the southeast of Perth, received 44.2 mm in half an hour, exceeding the conditions required for a 1 in 100-year flood {{in terms of a}} period from 15 to 30 minutes. However, the storm began to lessen in intensity and become larger, forming a multi-squall line as it moved further south. A second wave of storm activity developed behind the first set, delivering further falls to northern Perth. Around 4.30pm, a severe thunderstorm warning was issued for Mandurah and surrounding areas. However, the storm had begun to move further inland, resulting in no <b>hail</b> <b>reported</b> in Mandurah or Rockingham and 17.4/13.4 mm at Garden Island and Mandurah respectively while inland towns such as Dwellingup and Waroona received 30.2 and 26.8mm respectively.|$|R
40|$|A {{model to}} predict the {{probability}} of large hail in a thunderstorm using pre-storm environmental parameters is developed with an ensemble decision tree method known as Random Forest.

Applying the model to North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) data, a recent climatology of hail threat in the central United States is created and compared to observations. Model statistics, generated by defining probability thresholds to detect large hail and comparing the results to observed <b>hail</b> <b>reports,</b> show that the model has an advantage over other techniques in correctly forecasting hail occurrence.

40|$|Leathers, Daniel J. A {{climatology}} {{of severe}} hail (3 / 4 inches or greater) was constructed for the Northeastern Unites States (Figure 3. 1). This region {{was chosen because}} it contains highly populated urban environments adjacent to vast agricultural regions, {{both of which are}} susceptible to hail damage. This study provides a baseline climatology of severe hail throughout the Northeast United States (from 1955 - 2009) by investigating the spatial and temporal characteristics of severe hail storms, {{and the extent to which}} population density influences severe <b>hail</b> <b>reports.</b> Synoptic patterns and thermodynamic environments are also discussed by analyzing data from the top 85 most <b>reported</b> severe <b>hail</b> outbreaks, defined as significant severe hail event days. This data consists of daily mean composite synoptic weather maps, as well as information from nine upper air stations throughout the study region. The results show that the distribution of severe hail in the Northeastern United States is influenced by a combination of meteorological, technological, and societal factors. The daily mean composite synoptic maps show that significant severe hail outbreaks in the Northeastern United States commonly occur when the region is influenced by the ascending branch of a low amplitude, anomalous, 500 hPa trough, accompanied by an anomalous surface low pressure system, situated to the west or northwest of the study region. A weak east-west oriented cold front associated with this surface low typically provides the lifting needed to initiate severe convection. The largest reported severe hailstone throughout the duration of the study occurred in Virginia, in 1968, measuring 5 inches in diameter. Conversely, 57 % of all studied severe hailstones had a reported diameter of less than one inch. A majority of all severe <b>hail</b> <b>reports</b> occurred during the three month period of May, June, and July, between 1500 - 1659 hours local time. Thermodynamic information obtained using 00 UTC soundings showed that the K-Index, Total-Totals index, CAPE, and Wet Bulb Zero Level showed the most skill in forecasting significant severe hail outbreaks in the Northeastern United States. Due to a statically stable bias in the thermodynamic data by 00 UTC, non-surface based severe weather indices were able to provide a more reliable hail forecast than surface based severe weather indices.

40|$|Severe {{convective}} phenomena cause significant loss in {{the economy}} and, primarily, casualties. Therefore, {{it is essential to}} forecast such extreme events to avoid or minimize the negative consequences. Wind shear provides an updraft-downdraft separation in the convective cell, which extends the cell lifetime. Wind shears between a few different air layers have been examined in all damaging convective cases in Poland, taken from the European Severe Weather Database between 2011 and 2015, in order to find their values and patterns according to the intensity of this phenomenon. Each severe weather report was assigned wind shear values from the nearest sounding station, and subsequently the presented summary was made. It was found that wind shear values differ between the given phenomena and their intensity. This regularity is particularly visible in shears containing 0 km wind. The highest shears occur within wind reports. Lower values are associated with <b>hail</b> <b>reports.</b> An important difference between weak and F 1 + tornadoes was found in most of the wind shears.

Severe weather events are pinpointed using tornado and <b>hail</b> <b>reports</b> and correlating them with NEXRAD radar data to determine maximum intensity of the event. Severe storms that occur within 30 minutes of a model forecast hour are catalogued for further investigation. Once these events are diagnosed, ETA- 212 and MM 5 model data is regridded, centered on the storm. Divergence values at 300 hPa are extracted from the model data for each storm event. These storms are then grouped in three ways: all storms, tornadic storms, and hail producing storms. The averaged maximum divergence values from the ETA- 212 for each group are examined from the 0 hour analysis through the 21 hour forecast. From these averaged divergence values, a matrix of recommended divergence threshold values is derived. For the MM 5 data, a subset of storms is examined.

Observations by two Doppler radars are combined with <b>hail</b> <b>reports,</b> ground lightning detection and an aerial survey conducted after the event. The downburst-producing storm had formed at a synoptic convergence line within the warm sector of a cyclone.
