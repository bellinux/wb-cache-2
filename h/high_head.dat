25|$|PAC {{material}} is finer material. PAC {{is made up}} of crushed or ground carbon particles, 95–100% of which will pass through a designated mesh sieve. The ASTM classifies particles passing through an 80-mesh sieve (0.177mm) and smaller as PAC. It is not common to use PAC in a dedicated vessel, due to the <b>high</b> <b>head</b> loss that would occur. Instead, PAC is generally added directly to other process units, such as raw water intakes, rapid mix basins, clarifiers, and gravity filters.|$|E
2500|$|While {{horses in}} the wild mate and foal in mid to late spring, {{in the case of}} horses {{domestically}} bred for competitive purposes, especially horse racing, it is desirable that they be born as close to January 1 in the northern hemisphere or August 1 in the southern hemisphere as possible, so as to be at an advantage in size and maturity when competing against other {{horses in the}} same age group. When an early foal is desired, barn managers will put the mare [...] "under lights" [...] by keeping the barn lights on in the winter to simulate a longer day, thus bringing the mare into estrus sooner than she would in nature. [...] Mares signal estrus and ovulation by urination {{in the presence of a}} stallion, raising the tail and revealing the vulva.

40|$|Abstract. A {{low head}} {{hydropower}} station {{is in the}} southwest of China, its Francis turbine ran well at a rated power and rated net head, but the turbine produced severe abnormal vibration and noise at <b>higher</b> <b>head</b> than the rated head, full load and overload. By analyzing, characteristic points on vibration conditions are inside the area of channel vortices on runner performance curve. CFD analysis indicates that unstable vortices exist between runner blades. The two results demonstrate that the vibration and noise of Francis turbine are caused by runner channel vortices at <b>higher</b> <b>head</b> than the rated head, full load and overload...|$|R

40|$|Regenerative pump {{is a low}} {{specific}} speed and rotor-dynamic turbomachine capable of developing <b>high</b> <b>heads</b> at low flow rates. In this paper, a numerical study {{has been carried out}} in order to investigate the effect of blade angle on the performance of a regenerative pump. Two groups of impellers were employed. The first type has symmetric angle blades with identical inlet/outlet angles of ± 10 °, ± 30 °, and ± 50 ° and the second group has nonsymmetric angle blades in which the inlet angle was set to 0 ° and six different angles of ± 10 °, ± 30 °, and ± 50 ° were designed for the outlet of the blades. A total of 12 impellers, as well as primary radial blades impeller, were investigated in this study. The results showed that all forward blades have <b>higher</b> <b>head</b> coefficients than radial blades impeller at design flow coefficient. It was found that regenerative pumps with symmetric angle forward blades have better performance than other types. Also, it is worth mentioning that the <b>highest</b> <b>head</b> coefficient and efficiency occur at angle + 10 <β<+ 30 of symmetric angle blades. It was found that the maximum efficiency occurs at angle of + 15. 5 ° by curve fitting to the data obtained from numerical simulations for symmetric angle forward blades...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{covers the}} {{experimental}} examinations {{of the influence}} of attaching winglets to the blade tips of vortex pump impellers. The head, efficiency and power consumption as well as cavitation behavior are analyzed. At first, a series of tests compared an impeller with winglets with a semi-open impeller without winglets and to an impeller with a front shroud. The results suggest that an impeller with winglets leads to the <b>highest</b> <b>head</b> and the greatest efficiency. The impeller with front shroud generates <b>higher</b> <b>head</b> and efficiency than the semi-open impeller, which is frequently used for vortex pumps. A second test series investigates the cavitation performance when blade depth and diameter of impeller are varied compared to the first test series. It could be demonstrated that an impeller with winglets has a similar NPSH characteristic as an impeller without winglets. Thus winglets clearly improve the performance of vortex pumps...|$|R
