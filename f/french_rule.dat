5|$|<b>French</b> <b>rule</b> in {{the region}} was marked by the rapid {{implementation}} and extension of numerous reforms which had been passed in post-Revolution France since 1789. Administration was organized under the French model, with meritocratic selection. Legal equality and state secularism were also introduced.|$|E

5|$|The {{period of}} <b>French</b> <b>rule</b> {{coincided with the}} start of the Industrial Revolution in Belgium. Use of {{mechanical}} production techniques was encouraged by the French state. The government particularly encouraged industrialization of Belgian industries of military use, such as the cannon foundries at Liège.|$|E

40|$|In this article, Mr. Brault {{contends that}} 2 ̆ 2 harmonizing 2 ̆ 2 the <b>French</b> <b>rules</b> {{with those of}} Germany or the EEC is neither {{desirable}} nor necessary because of the disparate economic structures of the EEC Member States and because the <b>French</b> <b>rules</b> are, {{as a result of}} French case law, not as rigid and severe as their detractors portray them. Instead, Mr. Brault suggests that in practice, the national antitrust laws of EEC Member States are becoming 2 ̆ 2 harmonized 2 ̆ 2 naturally because German and EEC case law have made the application of apparently lenient refusals to supply statutes significantly more severe...|$|R
5|$|Under <b>French</b> <b>rule,</b> Teuruarii was {{initially}} allowed {{to serve as}} the village chief of Moerai, the main village and former capital in the northeast corner of the island. On 27 June 1934, the French named him honorary chief of Rurutu and his son Rooteatauira as chief of Moerai.|$|E
5|$|He and Hashim al-Atassi {{founded the}} National Bloc {{political}} party. It sought to use diplomatic means to end <b>French</b> <b>rule.</b> He {{was a part}} of the 1928 Constitutional Assembly, helping draft a constitution for the Syrian Republic. Al-Atassi appointed him Vice President of the National Bloc in 1930. Al-Bakri successfully ran for parliament as a representative of Damascus on the National Bloc's ticket in 1932, after winning a run-off vote by a large margin.|$|E
5|$|In Spain from 1808 to 1814 the Spanish War of Independence {{took place}} amidst a multi-cultural Spain. Spain, at the time, {{was under the}} control of King Joseph, who was Napoleon I of France's brother. Because the nation was {{under the control of}} <b>French</b> <b>rule,</b> the Spanish formed coalitions of ethnic groups to reclaim their own {{political}} representation, instead of the current French political system in power.|$|E
5000|$|The French Code Civil was {{the model}} for the BW of 1838. This {{does not mean that the}} BW is a copy of the Code. It appears that the BW was not simply a translation. The BW is {{influenced}} by the Code Civil, but this does not justify the view that the Netherlands adopted French law. On the contrary: Some <b>French</b> <b>rules</b> were removed. Former Dutch law was inserted instead of the <b>French</b> <b>rules</b> or as a supplement to the BW. We find a large part of the Code is based on joint roots, and that the most important common background is Roman law.|$|R
50|$|When the <b>French</b> <b>ruled</b> over Vietnam, they {{partially}} {{rebuilt the}} area. This period saw many French and Indians settling there to conduct business. Two small markets were demolished to make place for Đồng Xuân Market. Furthermore a tramway was constructed through the quarter.|$|R
50|$|After a {{landmark}} 2002 High Court decision confirmed {{the primacy of}} the Native Title Act of 1993, the Baada and Jawi people managed to obtain recognition of their native title claim in 2005, when a Federal Court under Justice <b>French</b> <b>ruled</b> that they were entitled to exclusive rights over some areas of the roughly 400 mi2 km2 to which they had laid claim. They also sought to claim a small section of Brue Reef, 31 miles north of Cape Leveque. Justice <b>French</b> <b>ruled</b> in June 2015 affirmed part of their claim, while adding they had non-exclusive native title rights over areas below the mean high water mark. The Brue Reef claim was dismissed.|$|R
5|$|The aim of {{the revolt}} was to inspire a wider {{uprising}} among the general populace {{in an attempt to}} overthrow the colonial regime and establish independence. The VNQDĐ had previously attempted to engage in clandestine activities to undermine <b>French</b> <b>rule,</b> but increasing French scrutiny on their activities led to their leadership group taking the risk of staging a large scale military attack in the Red River Delta in northern Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the {{conflict}} was not all positive from the French perspective. The revolts in Tyrol and the Kingdom of Westphalia during the conflict were an indication that there was much discontent over <b>French</b> <b>rule</b> among the German population. Just {{a few days before}} the conclusion of the Treaty of Schönbrunn, an 18-year-old German named Friedrich Staps approached Napoleon during an army review and attempted to stab the emperor, but he was intercepted in the nick of time by General Rapp. The emerging forces of German nationalism were too strongly rooted by this time, and the War of the Fifth Coalition played an important role in nurturing their development. By 1813, when the Sixth Coalition was fighting the French for control of Central Europe, the German population was fiercely opposed to <b>French</b> <b>rule</b> and largely supported the Allies.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1925, {{relations}} grew tense between al-Kharrat {{and other}} rebel leaders, particularly Sa'id al-'As and Ramadan al-Shallash, as they traded accusations of plundering villages or extorting local inhabitants. Al-Kharrat continued to lead operations in the Ghouta, where he was ultimately killed in a French ambush. The revolt dissipated by 1927, but he gained a lasting reputation as a martyr of the Syrian resistance to <b>French</b> <b>rule.</b>|$|E
50|$|In France, most {{competitions}} {{are played}} nine-man: games and leagues involving 19-year-old players or younger, division 3 (Le Casque d'Argent) and regional leagues. Blocking under the belt is strictly forbidden under nine-man <b>French</b> <b>rules,</b> but the field size {{remain the same}} as in 11-man football.|$|R

5|$|After a {{successful}} Maltese uprising against <b>French</b> <b>rule,</b> in 1800 Malta became a British protectorate, with the Castellania becoming {{known as the}} Gran Corte della Valletta. It was amongst the first public institutions to be reestablished. In February 1806, Alexander Ball gave instrcutions to presumably guarantee independence of the Judiciary, whereas the Judges could not be removed at a simple request, and legal persons would not be threatened to be jailed if they disagree with signing legal documents.|$|E
5|$|All three {{leaders were}} the descendents of Hova {{who had been}} {{politically}} prominent in the former Merina royal court. The movement was pacifist, and while it sought independence for Madagascar, it embraced the French vision of the island {{as part of the}} global Francophone economic and cultural community. Their platform garnered mass support that cut across geographic, ethnic and class divisions, and in November 1946 the trio were elected to represent Madagascar as deputies (députés) in the French National Assembly. The Malagasy deputies submitted a bill to liberate Madagascar from <b>French</b> <b>rule,</b> but French deputies rejected it.|$|E
5|$|Daoíz is commemorated as {{a leader}} of the initial {{resistance}} against <b>French</b> <b>rule</b> in Spain and, along with Velarde, is remembered in many monuments across the country. The ashes of Daoíz and Velarde, with those of others involved in the Dos de Mayo uprising, were transferred to the Monumento a los Caidos por España in Madrid after its construction in 1840. The monument originally served as a memorial to those who lost their lives on the Dos de Mayo but on 22 November 1985 King Juan Carlos I redesignated it in memory of all Spaniards who died in war and it now serves as Spain's national Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.|$|E

5|$|In Part Three, Henri Christophe {{has become}} the first King of Haiti and {{subjects}} the black population to worse slavery than that experienced under <b>French</b> <b>rule.</b> His regime carries out brutal torture and grips the city in fear. He is later tormented by thunder strikes and magical, ghostly appearances of previously tortured subjects. As the black population revolts against his rule, he finds himself alone and deserted. In this state he commits suicide by shooting himself. His body is taken {{to be buried in}} a fortress on a mountain and this becomes his mausoleum.|$|E
5|$|On March 28, {{the second}} phase of the {{operation}} started when several hundred rebels marched into Saigon dressed all in white, armed with only sticks and spears. Before the march, they had ingested potions that purportedly made them invisible. However, the French military were able to capture more than 80 of the supposedly invisible rebels during demonstrations against <b>French</b> <b>rule.</b> The police raided the homes of several people who were known to be involved with Long's plot, resulting in more arrests. They captured most of Long's main supporters, rendering the organisation impotent. However, Tri managed to escape.|$|E
5|$|Slavery in Indiana {{occurred}} {{between the time}} of <b>French</b> <b>rule</b> during the late seventeenth century and 1826, with a few traces of slavery afterward. When the United States first forcibly removed the Native Americans from the region, slavery was accepted as a necessity to keep peace with the Indians and the French. When the Indiana Territory was established in 1800, William Henry Harrison, a former slaveholder, was appointed governor and slavery continued to be tolerated {{through a series of}} laws enacted by the appointed legislature.|$|E

5|$|The French {{authorities}} imprisoned Long {{and many}} of his supporters, who openly admitted their aim of overthrowing French authorities at the trial. During the 1916 Cochinchina uprisings against <b>French</b> <b>rule,</b> many of Long's supporters attempted to break him out of jail. The French easily repelled the attack on the jail, decimating Long's movement. Following the attempted breakout, Long and his key supporters were put to death. Many of the remnants of his support base went on to join what later became the Cao Đài, a major religious sect in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|The French {{government}} negotiator Jean Sainteny flew to Saigon {{to consult}} Leclerc, who was acting as high commissioner {{in the absence}} of d'Argenlieu. Leclerc approved Sainteny's proposal to negotiate with Ho because he preferred a diplomatic solution to a larger conflict, but he still dispatched a flotilla with shiploads of French soldiers to northern Vietnam ready to attack if the talks failed. At that time, Ho felt that negotiations with the French constituted his best option because the Soviet Union had not yet endorsed the Vietminh or the Vietnamese nationalist party (VNQDD), and the French Communist Party chose to support <b>French</b> <b>rule</b> in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Ti Noel is well {{established}} early on as not only a witness to events, but also as someone who makes observations and offers reflection. It is he who considers slavery under Henri Christophe worse than that under <b>French</b> <b>rule</b> because blacks are now enslaving fellow blacks. It is also he who offers reflections about the difficulty of this world allowing {{for the possibility of}} greatness during the concluding remarks of the novel. His perspective represents that of the folk, including his belief in the African gods.|$|E

This prevented Paul from appointing Earp as deputy sheriff for the Tombstone area of Pima County.|$|R
