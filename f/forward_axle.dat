50|$|In UIC {{notation}} this wheel arrangement {{could be}} described as a 2′C1′1′ (or more fully, 2′C1′1′h4vS) as the two trailing axles were independent, rather than a four-wheeled bogie as for those leading. The <b>forward</b> <b>axle</b> was {{similar to that of the}} pacifics, having outside frames and Cartazzi axleboxes. The rear axle was an inside-framed Bissel truck, pivoted ahead of the leading axle.|$|E
50|$|Most six-wheel drive {{vehicles}} have a <b>forward</b> <b>axle</b> and two at {{the rear}} (with only the front pair steering), or three evenly spaced in varying steering configurations. Depending on the vehicle's role, the number of wheels varies between six (in three pairs) and ten (with two {{in the front and}} two dual axles with four wheels apiece in the rear). Drive may be limited to the rear two axles for on-road use.|$|E
5000|$|The cargo trailer is, {{by means}} of a king pin, hooked to a horseshoe-shaped {{quick-release}} coupling device called a fifth wheel or a turntable hitch {{at the rear of the}} towing engine that allows easy hook up and release. The truck trailer cannot move by itself because it only has wheels at the rear end: it requires a <b>forward</b> <b>axle,</b> provided by the towing engine, to carry half the load weight. When braking hard at high speeds, the vehicle has a tendency to fold at the pivot point between the towing vehicle and the trailer. Such a truck accident is called a [...] "trailer swing", although it is also commonly described as a [...] "jackknife". Jackknifing is a condition where the tractive unit swings round against the trailer, and not vice versa.|$|E

5000|$|This unusual wheel {{arrangement}} {{does not}} appear to have been used on the mainline railways in the UK. It was however one of the configurations used on the Mason Bogie articulated locomotives, in the USA during the 1870s and 1880s. Five examples were constructed at the Mason Machine Works for the narrow gauge Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad 1883-1887. The railway subsequently received twenty-one further examples between 1900 and 1914, constructed by the Taunton Locomotive Manufacturing Company, Manchester Locomotive Works, and ALCO. Developmentally, there are two logical ways of reaching this wheel formula: to add a <b>forward</b> <b>axle</b> to a Forney locomotive to improve its ability to negotiate curves, or to add a second trailing axle to a Columbia design, notably in a 2-4-4(T) configuration to expand its coal capacity.|$|E
5000|$|Though seldom seen today, the Magirus company {{produced}} {{almost all}} of the early, movable ladders used in the construction of large, rigid airships in both the Germany and the United States. The multi-extension, wooden ladders were mounted on massively constructed, wooden carriage frames with a [...] "fifth-wheel" [...] style, <b>forward</b> <b>axle</b> assembly. Although it appeared to be designed for horses, the ladders could be easily moved by two men. The carriage was equipped with four, hand screw type [...] "outriggers" [...] that would resist the ladder from tipping. The ladder did not swivel on the carriage. It was elevated and extended only towards the front of the carriage. In the [...] "working" [...] position, the ladder had to be elevated to about an 80 degree angle in order to allow full extension to 85 feet. (I do not know what the maximum extended length of the largest wooden Magirus ladder was, but the ones used during the erection of the Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation's USS AKRON and USS MACON reached to 85 feet.) ...|$|E
50|$|The Goose was {{originally}} {{powered by the}} engine, clutch and transmission {{that came with the}} Buick sedan. These powered the rear swiveling two-axle truck assembly mounted under the rear frame and compartment. The drive shaft powers only the <b>forward</b> <b>axle,</b> which was made from a modified Ford truck rear axle. The rearmost axle is driven by roller chains and sprockets mounted outside of the wheels. The rear truck has twenty-four inch diameter cast wheels.The braking is accomplished by brake shoes between the axles on each truck being pushed against the wheel treads. These are actuated by linkage connecting them to the normal foot pedal and parking brake lever. The foot brake is connected to the front truck and the parking brake lever is connected to the rear truck. Goose No. 2 never received air brakes.The original paint scheme of Goose No. 2 is still an item of much discussion. Examination of the paint layers on the rear compartment exterior shows a shade of green on the bottom layer. It is now a light green, probably a faded Pullman dark green paint. Over that is black paint, and then the aluminum paint that was used after 1935. The body on Goose No. 2 was replaced around 1939 with the body from the San Christobal Railroad Goose No. 1 which was built by the RGS for the San Christobal in 1934. This is a Fierce-Arrow Model 80 body and is longer with larger side windows than that of the Buick body. The rear freight compartment was shortened eight inches to allow for the longer body and avoid altering the frame and drive shafts. This is its current configuration as displayed.|$|E

50|$|Rio Grande Southern Railroad (RGS), Motor Number 6 (affectionately nicknamed Galloping Goose Number 6) is a {{gasoline}} engine powered narrow gauge railroad motor car. The Goose body and chassis were built from a Buick automobile. The new Buick body {{was cut off}} behind {{the front seat and}} a new rear wall installed. The steering wheel was removed as it was not needed, but the other controls remained. The front axle was removed and replaced with a swiveling two axle lightweight railroad truck with sixteen inch diameter wheels that carried and guided the front of the Goose. Ahead of the front truck is the pilot (cow catcher) attached to the frame. Two small pivoted scrapers attached {{to the rear of the}} pilot slide on the rails to keep small objects on the track from derailing the lightweight front truck. During the winter season a small snow plow (now stored on the car's flatbed) was attached to the front of the pilot.The rear of the car frame was lengthened using steel channel riveted together but welded to the frame to carry the truck type flat-bed platform. The bed has short stake racks around the sides to keep materials from falling off.The Goose was originally powered by the 6-cylinder engine, clutch and transmission that came with the Buick. The drive chain powers the rear swiveling two axle truck assembly mounted under the rear frame and platform bed.

40|$|This {{repeated}} measures study assessed {{the changes in}} speed, acceleration, stroke frequency, and shoulder range of motion (ROM) associated with different wheelchair axle positions in people with chronic cervical (C) 6 tetraplegia. Our main hypothesis is that the up and <b>forward</b> <b>axle</b> position is the most conducive to wheelchair propulsion, increasing speed and acceleration with a lower stroke frequency. In a chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) unit, we measured the speed, acceleration, stroke frequency, and shoulder ROM in four different axle positions in eight subjects with C 6 SCI. We analyzed two start-up strokes over a smooth, level vinyl floor in the Motion Analysis Laboratory (Fleni Institute; Escobar, Argentina). We analyzed data for significant statistical differences using the Wilcoxon signed rank test and the Friedman test. Our study showed that the up and <b>forward</b> <b>axle</b> position results in an increase of speed and acceleration, with a higher stroke frequency and a decreased shoulder ROM. In addition, the down and backward axle position results in the lowest speed and acceleration, with a lower stroke frequency and an increased shoulder ROM.

50|$|Achieving {{adequate}} traction {{required more}} of Rocket's weight {{to be over}} the driving axle than the carrying axle. The heavy boiler was placed <b>forwards,</b> with the <b>axle</b> beneath it, giving a 0-2-2 layout rather than 2-2-0. The cylinders were set at a steep angle, as used the year before for Lancashire Witch, rather than the typical vertical cylinders of this period. The cylinders were thus over the firebox and both driver and fireman shared a footplate at the same, rear, end of the engine. Previously they had often been separated to their own ends of the engine.|$|R
50|$|The Bronco was {{designed}} under engineer Paul G. Axelrad. The axles and brakes from the Ford F-100 {{four wheel drive}} pickup truck were used, but the front axle was located by radius arms (from the frame near {{the rear of the}} transmission <b>forward</b> to the <b>axle).</b> A lateral track bar allowed the use of coil springs that gave the Bronco a 34 ft turning circle, long wheel travel, and an anti-dive geometry, which was useful for snowplowing. The rear suspension was more conventional, with leaf springs in a typical Hotchkiss design. A shift-on the-fly Dana transfer case and locking hubs were standard, and heavy-duty suspension was an option.|$|R
50|$|The Loyd Carrier {{was built}} upon the {{mechanicals}} (engine, gearbox and transmission) of a 15 cwt 4x2 Fordson 7V truck with mild steel bodywork to which armour plate (referred to as 'BP Plate' in Loyd manuals) was bolted (to {{the front and}} upper sides) depending on application. The engine was {{at the rear of}} the Carrier with the radiator behind rather than in front. The transmission then took the drive <b>forward</b> to the <b>axle</b> at the very front where it drove the tracks. Both the front drive sprockets and idlers (which were also sprocketed) {{at the rear of the}} tracks were fitted with brakes, actuated by a pair of levers by the driver. To turn the vehicle to the left, the brakes were applied on that side and the Carrier would slew round the stopped track.|$|R
40|$|The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, in {{coordination}} with the Federal Highway Administration, sponsored the Heavy and Overweight Vehicle Brake Testing (HOVBT) program {{in order to provide}} information about the effect of gross vehicle weight (GVW) on braking performance. Because the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations limit the number of braking system defects that may exist for a vehicle to be allowed to operate on the roadways, the examination of the effect of brake defects on brake performance for increased loads is also relevant. The HOVBT program seeks to provide relevant information to policy makers responsible for establishing load limits, beginning with providing test data for a combination tractor/trailer. This testing was conducted on a five-axle combination vehicle with tractor brakes meeting the Reduced Stopping Distance requirement rulemaking. This report provides a summary of the testing activities, the results of various analyses of the data, and recommendations for future research. Following a complete brake rebuild, instrumentation, and brake burnish, stopping tests were performed from 20 and 40 mph with various brake application pressures (15 psi, 25 psi, 35 psi, 45 psi, 55 psi, and full system pressure). These tests were conducted for various brake conditions at the following GVWs: 60, 000, 80, 000, 91, 000, 97, 000, 106, 000, and 116, 000 lb. The 80, 000 -lb GVWs included both balanced and unbalanced loads. The condition of the braking system was also varied. To introduce these defects, brakes (none, <b>forward</b> drive <b>axle,</b> or rear trailer axle) were made inoperative. In addition to the stopping tests, performance-based brake tests were conducted for the various loading and brake conditions. Analysis of the stopping test data showed the stopping distance to increase with load (as expected) and also showed that more braking force was generated by the drive axle brakes than the trailer axle brakes. The constant-pressure stopping test data revealed a linear relationship between brake application pressure and was used to develop an algorithm to normalize stopping data for weight and initial speed...|$|R
40|$|Frame and cab {{suspension}} {{designs of}} Class 8 heavy trucks were investigated {{to see their}} effects on ride comfort. Four trucks were used in this study, each with a different frame: a factory low frame, a lightweight low frame, a factory high frame, and a lightweight high frame. There were two different frame heights and three thicknesses. Two different rear cab suspensions were also tried out on each truck. Both suspensions used two airsprings and two dampers mounted vertically to control the vertical motion. The first suspension used two horizontally mounted dampers to control the lateral motion, while the second used a panhard rod connected to a torsion spring. In addition, two different sets of airsprings and two sets of vertical shocks were tried with each suspension, giving eight suspension combinations. The trucks were shaken through the <b>forward</b> drive (second) <b>axle</b> using two 5500 lb hydraulic actuators with displacement control. The steering (first) axle was left {{in contact with the}} ground (through the tires) and the rear drive (third) axle was strapped to the truck’s frame and acted solely as dead weight.

5000|$|This {{automobile}} was {{manufactured by}} the Bourbeau et Devaux Co. of Paris from 1910 to 1925 to a design by Robert Bourbeau. Rather than scaling down existing motor-car designs, Bourbeau chose to adapt mainly motor-cycle practice for his design, {{giving rise to}} the cyclecar designation. [...] The low and light car carried its two passengers {{in tandem with the}} passenger seated at the front, while in the rear was the person doing the steering. Single-cylinder or 10 hp V-twin engines were used. Drive was to the rear wheels through a belt which could be moved between pulleys to give a two speed transmission. The front axle was centre pivotted with suspension by a single mid mounted coil spring and the steering was by a cable and bobbin. Elliptic leaf springs were used at the rear. The method of changing gear was unusual. The rear driver had to operate a lever which slackened the belt by moving the rear <b>axle</b> <b>forwards</b> and then the passenger had to move the belt between pulleys by means of a separate lever. How the car was driven without a passenger is not explained. On later cars the levers were moved so that the driver could steer the car for himself. [...] Before World War I, Bédélia cyclecars sold very well, even in Britain.|$|R
5000|$|The GM Truck and Coach PD-4103 was {{the last}} {{in a series of}} low-budget [...] "conversion" [...] parlor coach models which were, in actuality, based upon the basic Yellow Coach/GM Truck and Coach transit bus models which first {{appeared}} in 1940. Favored GM customer Greyhound Lines had already been given a near monopoly on the PDA-3701/PD-3751 [...] "Old Silversides" [...] models, which were in part designed by Greyhound themselves. In order to answer complaints from arch competitor Trailways and other independent operators about being locked out from purchasing the PD-3751 model, GM simply took their existing 96" [...] wide, 35' long suburban transit model, added more luggage bay space underneath, added sliding highway-style side windows, added reclining seating, and shortened the overhung portion of the front end by moving the front <b>axle</b> <b>forward</b> using a new front end from the wartime Yellow Coach [...] "Victory Cruiser" [...] model. This was the PD-4101, which appeared shortly after the end of World War II. GM created the model PD-4102 by restyling its PD-4101 in 1950 using a distinctive new front end with the destination sign below the windshield and a new, restyled rear end which used a full-width engine access door, an aluminum alloy bumper to match that on the front and a [...] "post-less" [...] picture window in the rear which used biradial curved glass (a new development by GM supplier, Libbey-Owens-Ford), replacing the divided flat transit bus-type rear windows found on the PD-4101. The front end styling job on the PD-4102 was reactionary, as it closely mimicked the striking styling of the IC41 intercity bus built by ACF-Brill Corporation in 1947-1954, a model bought in large quantities by Trailways to compete with Greyhound Lines' successful and much more efficient PD-3701/PD-3751 [...] "Silversides" [...] models. Mechanically and electrically, however, the PD-4102 was mostly a carry-over model from the PD-4101, including the optional refrigeration unit for air conditioning which used a four cylinder Continental [...] "pony motor" [...] driving an Ingersoll-Rand [...] "oil-less" [...] rotary vane compressor rated at five tons, a unit identical to that used by the PDA-3501/PD-3751 for Greyhound Lines. Only 116 were built.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{places in}} North America, length is {{commonly}} 48 feet or 53 feet, and width is either 96 or 102 inches (including rub rails and stake pockets on the sides, which generally placed every 2 feet). Some older trailers still in service are only 45 feet or shorter if used in sets of doubles or triples (often used to haul hay). Various lengths and combination setups {{can only be}} legally driven on turnpike/toll roads which are far too long for most roadways. Body and frame {{can be one of}} 3 general designs: the heaviest and sturdiest is all steel (usually with wood planks), Ever popular combo with steel frame and aluminium bed, these type often have wood portions for nailing down dunnage boards), and aluminium (which is the lightest allowing for more cargo to be legally carried without overweight permits). Incredibly light and very expensive to purchase, all aluminium trailers are very slippery when wet, flex more and are easily damaged. They also have a natural upwards bend so that when loaded they straighten out to be more flat, rather than to sag in the middle under a load. Another popular type of flatbed trailer is a stepdeck (or drop deck) with approximately 2 feet lower deck and low profile wheels to accommodate taller loads, without hitting low bridges or tunnels. These stepdecks can come with loading ramps to allow vehicles to roll on and off of the back from ground level. Shorter trailers used for local jobs such as landscaping and building material delivery within urban or local areas can have a [...] "hitchhiker" [...] type forklift truck attached to the back in order for driver alone to deliver and unload pallet/skid items. A bulkhead or [...] "headache rack" [...] is sometimes be attached to the front of either a straight or a stepdeck trailer for load securement {{at the front of the}} deck. In the event of long pipes or steel or lumber coming loose in a hard braking incident, they save the operator and cab/sleeper in one of two manners in theory. If attached to the trailer they bend while attempting to block forward motion of a loosened cargo, causing the long load to go above the cab and driver. If attached to the frame behind the cab or sleeper of the tractor, in theory they protect the back of the cab from impact and if unable to stop the load coming thru the cab, they cause the cab to be knocked off of.the frame, rather than impale the cab and kill or seriously injure the driver.48 and 53 ft lengths usually have two axles spread out to over 10 ft apart at the rear [...] "California spread" [...] in order to allow for more weight distribution on the rear of the deck (40,000 lb instead of 34,000 for a tandem axles design). So-called Cali spread was originally designed to comply with bridge weight formulas in that state but has since been adopted in most other parts of the country. These spread axles take far wider turning radius, and if turning the combination tractor/trailer too sharply, the front axle tires of the trailer may damage the road/parking lot surface, or pop a tire bead off of the rim, or both. Some trailers have the capability of lifting or lowering the front axle independently to mitigate this risk, however driver may not be able to use this feature if the trailer is loaded, but if the deck is empty the driver can lower the front axle to bring the rear axle off of the ground to significantly decrease turning radius of the rig for easy manoeuvre in tight spaces, or to reduce tire wear during empty /deadhead miles of travel. Under the deck of the trailer can be attached racks for spare tires, dunnage boards, or tire chains...as well as various tool/storage boxes. On one side (or often both sides for alternating pull on strap tension) are usually sliding (but sometimes fixed) winches to ratchet down 4 inch straps for load securement. On most 48 foot trailers, you may not place these strap/winches over a tire as when air pressure releases out of the suspension system when parked, the deck lowers down and will likely pop a trailer tire. Some trailers have an air scale which when the driver learns how to interpret properly through experience, combined with his knowledge of how much his/her rig weighs when empty and can interpret how much cargo can safely and legally be loaded onto the trailer. With different varying loads of cargo, driver can have an idea how much his gross total weight is (and if he is legal to avoid ticket) (80,000 without a permit in most states, but slightly lower in others). Some decks have pop up chain systems which have a higher WLL (working load limit) than attaching chains to either the stake pocket/spools, or the frame. Other decks of trailers can have sliding detachable accessories which greatly diversify your options of where and how to place a chain hook for securement. Besides axles which raise/lower as needed, some spread axle trailers can slide one or both <b>axles</b> <b>forward,</b> or back to create a tandem setup in specific situations when necessary, to comply with weight distribution requirements. Although certain amounts of front and rear cargo overhang is allowed (as well as overhang to one or both sides of the trailer) with flags/banners/flashing lights to warn drivers behind and to the side of you of impending danger of impalement if they follow too close behind you and you should have to suddenly stop...in extreme cases permit loads require escort be led front rear or both for oversize/over dimension cargo/equipment.|$|R
