40|$|Electricity is {{a special}} energy which is hard to store, so the {{electricity}} demand forecasting remains an important problem. Accurate short-term load forecasting (STLF) plays {{a vital role in}} power systems because it is the essential part of power system planning and operation, and it is also fundamental in many applications. Considering that an individual forecasting model usually cannot work very well for STLF, a hybrid model based on the seasonal ARIMA model and BP neural network is presented in this paper to improve the forecasting accuracy. Firstly the seasonal ARIMA model is adopted to forecast the electric load <b>demand</b> <b>day</b> ahead; then, by using the residual load demand series obtained in this forecasting process as the original series, the follow-up residual series is forecasted by BP neural network; finally, by summing up the forecasted residual series and the forecasted load demand series got by seasonal ARIMA model, the final load demand forecasting series is obtained. Case studies show that the new strategy is quite useful to improve the accuracy of STLF...|$|E
40|$|The linkage of {{combined}} {{heating and}} power (CHP) systems with local heating networks {{has the potential}} to increase energy efficiency on city district scale. First, CHP systems have a high overall efficiency. Second, the usage of CHP systems as heat sources for local heating networks can lead to advantageous economics of scale effects. With an increasing number of buildings the number of possible energy system combinations enlarges tremendously. A manual design approach might lead to a suboptimal solution. This paper describes an approach for the optimized placement of CHP systems, boilers, thermal storages and local heating networks on city district level. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem has been formulated within the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). The objective function is the cost minimization of the overall system under ecological and technical constraints. To reduce the optimization runtime, a k-Medoids <b>demand</b> <b>day</b> clustering and a minimum spanning tree strategy have been implemented. A small city district has been designed as test case. On one hand the lgorithm leads to planning solutions with reduced overall costs as well as decreased greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand a number of 9 buildings leads to 2. 5 hours runtime. Therefore, further work on strategies for run time reduction is required...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Medical {{diagnostic}} data {{produced by}} hospitals has increased exponentially. The coming era of digitized medical information and film-less imaging, {{has made it}} a challenge {{to deal with the}} storage and transmission requirement of enormous data. With this, selective medical image compression, a technique where explicitly defined regions of interest are compressed in a lossless way whereas image regions containing unimportant information are compressed in a lossy manner are in <b>demand,</b> <b>day</b> by day. Such techniques are of great interest in telemedicine which is a rapidly developing application of clinical medicine, where medical information is transferred through interactive audiovisual media. Archiving and retaining these data for at least more than two years is expensive, difficult and requires sophisticated data compression techniques. In the current research work, the focus has been solely on the performance evaluation on the ROI-based compression of medical images, but in a different prospective. The Mammogram images are used for the study. The image is divided into regions; ROI and the background. Then the arbitrary shape ROI breast region is compressed losslessly using losses image compression algorithms like SPIHT, JPEG 2000 and Adaptive SPIHT. The background can be discarded or compressed as user’s will. The work also introduces an ROI medical image compression technique that is able to assign priorities in case of multiple ROIs. Experimental results show that the proposed method offer potential advantages like extraction and integration of arbitrary shaped ROI, energy efficiency, ROI priority etc. in medical applications of digital mammography applications...|$|E
40|$|Power-to-gas (PtG) {{converts}} electricity into hydrogen {{using the}} electrolysis process {{and uses the}} gas grid for the storage and transport of hydrogen. Hydrogen is injected into a gas network in a quantity and quality compatible with the gas safety regulations and thereby transported as a mixture of hydrogen and natural gas to demand centres. Once integrated into the electricity network, PtG systems can provide flexibility to the power system and absorb excess electricity from renewables to produce hydrogen. Injection of hydrogen into the gas network reduces gas volumes supplied from terminals. In order to investigate this concept, hydrogen electrolysers were included as a technology option within an operational optimisation model of the Great Britain (GB) combined gas and electricity network (CGEN). The model {{was used to determine}} the minimum cost of meeting the electricity and gas demand in a typical low and high electricity <b>demand</b> <b>day</b> in GB, {{in the presence of a}} significant capacity of wind generation. The value of employing power-to-gas systems in the gas and electricity supply system was investigated given different allowable levels of hydrogen injections. The results showed that producing hydrogen from electricity is capable of reducing wind curtailment in a high wind case and decreasing the overall cost of operating the GB gas and electricity network. The northern part of GB was identified as a suitable region to develop hydrogen electrolysis and injection facilities due to its vicinity to a significant capacity of wind generation, as well as the existence of gas network headroom capacity, which is expected to increase as a result of depletion of UK domestic gas resources...|$|E
40|$|Electrical load {{management}} {{is used to}} reduce peak electrical demand from two or more electrical loads. The success of on-farm electrical {{load management}} depends on its technical feasibility and its potential for reducing peak demand without disrupting critical farm opertions. ^ A computer simulation model was developed for studying potential on-farm electrical load management systems. The model was used for fine tuning parameters and for comparing alternative strategies. ^ Model inputs included the frequency and duration of all simulated farm operations. Model output consisted of the daily electrical demand profile for the farm and the operation history for each electrical load. ^ A load management system was developed for the feed processing and grain handling loads at a University farm near Mead, Nebraska. Field experiments demonstrated the technical feasibility of a computer-based load management system and provided data for validating the model. Simulations of the University farm system using input data from the field experiments were used to fine tune electrical load management parameters and logic. Sensitivity analyses showed that success of the electrical load management system depended on careful selection of parameters used in sophisticated load priority schemes. ^ Statistical distributions governing the behavior of each load at the feed and grain center were used for obtaining random samples of service and interarrival times in stochastic simulation experiments. These experiments tested the effects of five demand setpoints (12 to 24 kW) at three levels of task frequency. Experiments were performed both with and without the generation of miscellaneous, uncontrolled electrical loads. Simulation results indicated several tradeoffs when selecting an electrical demand setpoint. Low setpoints improved daily load factor with greater peak reductions but also increased the risk of not satisfactorily completing all farm tasks. ^ The approach used in evaluating on-farm electrical load management systems was illustrated. Several simulations of a potential load management system at a commercial grain and livestock farm were conducted for a typical high <b>demand</b> <b>day.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Research {{suggests}} that beliefs about willpower affect self-regulation following previous self-regulatory demands (Job et al., 2010). Some {{people believe that}} their willpower is limited, meaning that after a demanding task {{it needs to be}} replenished (limited theory). By contrast, others believe that willpower is not limited and that previous self- control tasks even activate willpower (non-limited theory). We hypothesized that when people experience a <b>demanding</b> <b>day</b> their beliefs about willpower predict their expected capacity to self-regulate and their actual self-regulation on the following day. In a daily diary study (N = 157), we measured students’ daily level of demands, their expected performance in unpleasant tasks, and their effective goal striving. Results showed that following a <b>demanding</b> <b>day,</b> students with a non-limited theory had higher expectations about their progress in unpleasant tasks and were striving more efficiently for their goals than students with a limited theory. These findings suggest that beliefs about willpower affect whether demands experienced on a previous day have positive or negative consequences on people’s self-regulation...|$|R

40|$|The San Antonio Water System (SAWS) {{has been}} {{experiencing}} substantial growth in its service area for several decades, and steady growth {{is expected to}} continue for the next 15 - 20 years. The SAWS network has historically been supplied primarily from wells in the Edwards Aquifer, and more recently supplemented by water from the Trinity Aquifer and Canyon Lake in the north. In recent years, withdrawal restrictions have been instituted for the Edwards Aquifer, prompting SAWS and neighboring water suppliers to develop additional water sources to meet future growth. SAWS recently constructed the Twin Oaks Water Treatment Plant in the southeast corner of the system to treat water from the Carrizo-Wilcox Aquifer and to store Edwards Aquifer water in an Aquifer Storage and Recovery facility. Large capacity pumps and a 60 -inch diameter transmission main deliver Twin Oaks facility water to primary pump stations {{on the east side of}} the system. This arrangement has worked well to integrate up to 30 million gallons per day (MGD) of Twin Oaks water into the system, but given the Edwards Aquifer restrictions during drought periods, SAWS desires to integrate up to 60 MGD to help meet projected growth and to offset their use and dependence upon the Edwards Aquifer in times of drought. This paper describes how SAWS used hydraulic modeling and Optimatics Genetic Algorithm (OGA) optimization to determine a hydraulically viable low-cost set of new infrastructure improvements, as well as a flexible operating strategy, designed to integrate up to 60 MGD of Twin Oaks water into the existing distribution system. A 24 -hour extended period simulation scenario of the 2013 projected minimum <b>demand</b> <b>day</b> was constructed with the existing hydraulic model. The OGA optimization routine was linked to the model and customized by inputting potential improvement alternatives, hydraulic constraints and unit cost data. The objective of the optimization was to identify minimum-cost improvements that met demands using the full 60 MGD from the Twin Oaks facility while satisfying constraints for minimum pressure, maximum velocity, and storage tank return levels. Millions of improvement combinations were evaluated against hydraulic constraints and cost by the genetic algorithm optimization process. Ultimately a hydraulically-viable, low-cost solution of capital improvements was chosen which successfully integrated 60 MGD of Twin Oaks water as well as 9 MGD from other sources. New pipes were recommended near and between 5 primary pump stations to overcome existing capacity constraints and convey Twin Oaks water into the existing system. New pumps at two primary stations and three new control valves were also part of the solution. With these improvements, most of the secondary wells and some of the primary wells that currently supply Edwards Aquifer water did not need to operate, allowing non-Edwards Aquifer water to supply as much of the system as possible. The total estimated capital cost of the solution was $ 32 million. Elsinore Mann, Alana Duncker, Jamily Andreu, Adam Eddy, Jeff Haby, Angus R Simpso...|$|E
