40|$|A {{trial to}} {{evaluate}} the efficacy of a 1 % cyfluthrin pour-on formulation (Cylence, Bayer) in reducing the incidence of bovine trypanosomosis was conducted {{in an area of}} ca. 2000 km 2 of the Eastern Province of Zambia. The trial area was cultivated and carried a cattle population of approximately 11 animals/km 2. Cattle were the main host of tsetse. Following the <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> <b>treatment</b> of the adult cattle at intervals of 7 weeks and at a dosage of 15 ml/ 100 kg body weight, there was an increase in the average packed cell volume in the herd although the decline in the incidence of trypanosomal infections was more prolonged. The monthly incidence of trypanosomal infections started to decline substantially 8 months after the treatments were initiated. No trypanosomal infections were detected from 10 months after the start of the trial...|$|E
40|$|In 1988 the CEO {{of a major}} {{international}} pharmaceutical firm {{held a press conference}} to announce that his corporation would provide the drug Mectizan <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> for the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> onchocerciasis, a blinding tropical disease sometimes called river blindness. People who suffer from river blindness are almost always poor, and the parasite that causes the disease lives mostly in Africa. In the subsequent years the donation program has prospered, and it has taken a central place in the international professional imagination of global health. The Mectizan donation has become a symbol and a case study for a number of new "forms of life," in the Wittgenstein sense: the public-private partnership, the mass drug administration, and a peculiar, new kind of public health intervention that shrugs its way between boundaries, ignoring, subverting, or making irrelevant older ideas of the "publics" involved in public health, the articulation between the corporation and the state, and the concept of health itself...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to identify and document facilitating and constraining factors in the antiretroviral therapy (ART) programme in a public health care setting in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Observations for the study were carried out in a district hospital and two down-referral clinics in Makana Local Services Area in the Eastern Cape Province. Two discussion groups with key stakeholders were conducted to gather information about opinions and experiences among the health care providers (HCPs). It was found that the operating ART programme in this setting has been integrated in the existing down-referral health care system, based on follow-up in primary health care (PHC) clinics. <b>Treatment</b> is provided <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge.</b> The <b>treatment</b> programme provides the patients with access to counselling, nutritional assistance, psychosocial support and social welfare evaluation. However, increasing patient numbers and lack of human resources leads to a heavy workload for the HCPs involved with the ART programme. The need for additional, educated health workers is a major constraint for progress in provision of health care to patients who have accepted their HIV status, and are enrolled, or waiting to be enrolled, on the ART. However, delegation of work tasks among available HCPs and good communication between HCPs in the different clinics is a facilitating factor that ensures efficient use of the human resources available. Conclusion: Taking into account the challenges in a resource-constrained setting, this programme shows potential for functioning well as a provider of ART for those who are able and willing to access it. Considering an already heavy workload for HCPs, limitations and challenges still exist in reaching out with adequate treatment to a greater number of people who need ART...|$|R
40|$|The study {{assessed}} the operational feasibility and acceptability of insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) in one Primary Health Centre (PHC) in a falciparum malaria endemic {{district in the}} state of Orissa, India, where 74 % of the people are tribes and DDT indoor residual spraying had been withdrawn and ITNs introduced by the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme. To a population of 63, 920, 24, 442 ITNs were distributed <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> through 101 <b>treatment</b> centers during July-August 2002. Interview of 1, 130, 1, 012 and 126 respondents showed that the net use rates were 80 %, 74 % and 55 % in the cold, rainy and summer seasons, respectively. Since using ITNs, 74. 5 - 76. 6 % of the respondents observed reduction of mosquito bites and 7. 2 - 32. 1 % reduction of malaria incidence; 37 % expressed willingness to buy ITNs if the cost was lower and they were affordable. Up to ten months post-treatment, almost 100 % mortality of vector mosquitoes was recorded on unwashed and washed nets (once or twice). Health workers re-treated the nets at the treatment centers eight months after distribution on a cost-recovery basis. The coverage reported by the PHC was only 4. 2 %, mainly because of unwillingness of the people to pay for re-treatment and to go to the treatment centers from their villages. When the re-treatment was continued at the villages involving personnel from several departments, the coverage improved to about 90 %. Interview of 126 respondents showed that among those who got their nets re-treated, 81. 4 % paid cash for the re-treatment and the remainder were reluctant to pay. Majority of those who paid said that they did so due to the fear that if they did not do so they would lose benefits from other government welfare schemes. The 2 nd re-treatment was therefore carried out <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> nine months after the 1 st re-treatment and thus achieved coverage of 70. 4 %. The study showed community acceptance to use ITNs as they perceived the benefit. Distribution and re-treatment of nets was thus possible through the PHC system, if done <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> and when personnel from different departments, especially those at village level, were involved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Despite being <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge,</b> <b>treatment</b> {{adherence}} to 7 -day primaquine for the radical cure of Plasmodium vivax {{was estimated at}} 62. 2 % among patients along the Iquitos-Nauta road in the Peruvian Amazon. The principal reason for non-adherence was the perceived adverse effects related to local humoral illness conceptions that hold that malaria produces a hot state of body, which is further aggravated by the characteristically hot medical treatment. Notably, patients were willing {{to adhere to the}} first 3 days of treatment during which symptoms are most apparent and include the characteristic chills. Nevertheless, as symptoms abate, the perceived aggravating characteristics of the medication outweigh the perceived advantages of treatment adherence. Improving community awareness about the role of primaquine to prevent further malaria transmission and fostering a realistic system of direct observed treatment intake, organized at community level, can be expected to improve {{adherence to}} the radical cure of P. vivax in this area...|$|E
