25|$|One of Langston's most {{difficult}} challenges <b>is</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> giant Canada geese (Branta canadensis maxima) which inhabit the tidal marshes of Kingman Lake and the Anacostia River. Hundreds {{of the birds}} inhabit the marshes. The birds not only feed voraciously on the course's grasses, but their feces harm the greens and pose a health hazard to golfers. They also feed on and destroy the marsh plants which the National Park Service planted in Kingman Lake and the Anacostia River {{in the hope that}} these will help filter the water and restore the health of the river. In 2007, federal park officials began considering a program to cull the geese population around Langston Golf Course in an attempt to save the river, an effort opposed by some animal rights groups.|$|E

500|$|In the series' {{first story}} arc, Khan faces off against Mr. Edison / the Inventor, {{an amalgam of}} man and bird. Wilson created the Inventor to be Khan's first arch rival in order to mirror Khan's own complexity. Wilson characterizes the Inventor, and the overall visual look of the opening story arc as [...] "kooky and almost Miyazaki-esque at times", owing to the art style of {{illustrator}} Adrian Alphona, which balances {{the drama of the}} threats which Khan faces with the humor of Alphona's [...] "tongue in cheek sight gags." [...] During the storyline, Khan also teams-up with the X-Man Wolverine against the Inventor. Because Wolverine <b>is</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> loss of his healing factor during this time, Khan is placed in the position of having to shoulder much of the responsibilities, as Wilson felt this was a role reversal that would subvert reader expectations that Wolverine would take the lead in such a team-up.|$|E
500|$|... "The Master Plan" [...] {{marked the}} end of the romantic {{relationship}} between Mark and Ann, which had lasted throughout the entire second season. This allowed for the eventual departure of Paul Schneider, who was leaving the series {{at the end of the}} second season. The title of [...] "The Master Plan" [...] stemmed from the fact that real-life municipal planning documents in small American towns are often called the [...] "master plan", like the one Leslie refers to in the episode. Schur said of this, [...] "It seems so funny to call the municipal budgets and planning documents for a small city in Indiana the 'master plan'." [...] Schur said the Parks and Recreation writing staff believed the title of the episode was appropriate because the subplots of [...] "The Master Plan" [...] revolved around the various plans of the characters. While Leslie <b>is</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> literal master plan for the Pawnee budget proposal, April's plan is to seek a romantic relationship with Andy, and Tom's plan is to find a girlfriend at April's birthday party.|$|E
500|$|There are {{two major}} {{instances}} of allusions to environmental issues within the movie. The first is seen when Chihiro <b>is</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> [...] "stink spirit." [...] The stink spirit was actually a river spirit, {{but it was so}} corrupted with filth that one couldn't tell what it was at first glance. It only became clean again when Chihiro pulled out a huge amount of trash, including car tires, garbage, and a bicycle. This alludes to human pollution of the environment, and how people can carelessly toss away things without thinking of the consequences and of where the trash will go. The second allusion is seen in Haku himself. Haku does not remember his name and lost his past, which is why he is stuck at the bathhouse. Eventually, Chihiro remembers that he used to be the spirit of the Kohaku River, which was destroyed and replaced with apartments. Because of human's need for development, they destroyed a part of nature, causing Haku to lose his home and identity. This can be compared to deforestation and desertification; humans tear down nature, cause imbalance in the ecosystem, and demolish animals' homes to satisfy their want for more space (housing, malls, stores, etc.) but don't think about how it can affect other living things.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the biggest}} reasons {{for the success of}} his company is the {{extraordinary}} efforts taken to involve the public throughout many stages of a bridge’s development. [...] “One of the important activities to us <b>is</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> public and designing bridges that the public wants,” said Figg. [...] “We’re convinced that the bridge tells you what the public thinks of itself.” (Zehyer 2002) [...] Often considered an advocate for public involvement in bridge design, Figg conducted public meetings during both the design and construction stages of major bridge projects. [...] During these meetings, Figg worked with the communities to help them arrive at decisions about the appearance of the bridge, while ensuring they stay within budget (ASCE 2002). [...] These ideals which were passed down to his daughter, Linda, should serve as lessons for anyone entering the engineering field.|$|E
2500|$|The Pomegranate also {{published}} {{a review of}} Hutton's tome authored by Sarah Whedon of the University of Colorado. Noting that it was unparalleled, she {{believed that it was}} a valuable addition to the growing field of Pagan studies, being written in an entertaining and meticulous manner. She nevertheless believed that it contained problems, for instance disagreeing with Hutton's statement that Madame Blavatsky was ultimately a Christian and believing that he had left some historical sections underdeveloped. She notes that because he <b>is</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> hidden history of a mystery religion, Hutton has had to be selective in what information he decided to publish and which he kept from publication, believing that this might annoy many readers. Like O'Connor, she notes that Hutton has opened up multiple new lines of inquiry for further research, but feels that his final chapter, the sociological analysis of Wicca, was disappointing. She nevertheless thought that these criticisms were [...] "minor" [...] in comparison to the contribution to Pagan studies that the work brought.|$|E

He continued to work on refining the translation until the end of his life. Others had translated the Bible into German, but Luther tailored his translation to his own doctrine. When he was criticised for inserting the word [...] "alone" [...] after [...] "faith" [...] in Romans 3:28, he replied in part: [...] "he text itself and the meaning of St. Paul urgently require and demand it. For in that very passage he <b>is</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> main point of Christian doctrine, namely, that we are justified by faith in Christ without any works of the Law. ...

60|$|Those on The English Humorists {{were given}} first. The second set was on The Four Georges. In the volume now before us The Georges are printed first, {{and the whole}} is {{produced}} simply {{as a part of}} Thackeray's literary work. Looked at, however, in that light the merit of the two sets of biographical essays is very different. In the one we have all the anecdotes which could be brought together respecting four of our kings,--who as men were not peculiar, though their reigns were, and will always be, famous, because the country during the period was increasing greatly in prosperity and was ever strengthening the hold it had upon its liberties. In the other set the lecturer was a man of letters dealing with men of letters, and himself a prince among humorists <b>is</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> humorists of his own country and language. One could not imagine a better subject for such discourses from Thackeray's mouth than the latter. The former was not, I think, so good.|$|E
60|$|We {{admit that}} Mr. Skipsey's work is {{extremely}} unequal, {{but when it}} is at its best {{it is full of}} sweetness and strength; and though he has carefully studied the artistic capabilities of language, he never makes his form formal by over-polishing. Beauty with him seems to be an unconscious result rather than a conscious aim; his style has all the delicate charm of chance. We have already pointed out his affinity to Blake, but with Burns also he may be said to have a spiritual kinship, and in the songs of the Northumbrian miner we meet with something of the Ayrshire peasant's wild gaiety and mad humour. He gives himself up freely to his impressions, and there is a fine, careless rapture in his laughter. The whole book deserves to be read, and much of it deserves to be loved. Mr. Skipsey can find music for every mood, whether he <b>is</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> real experiences of the pitman or with the imaginative experiences of the poet, and his verse has a rich vitality about it. In these latter days of shallow rhymes it is pleasant to come across some one to whom poetry is a passion not a profession.|$|E
