The measured FA may depend on the effective length scale of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>measurement.</b> If the diffusion process is not constrained on the scale being measured (the constraints are too far apart) or the constraints switch direction {{on a smaller scale}} than the measured one, then the measured FA will be attenuated.

Liquid crystals can also exhibit anisotropic diffusion because the needle or plate-like shapes of their molecules affect how they slide over one another. When the FA is 0 the tensor nature of D is often ignored, and it is called the diffusion constant.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{clinical}} {{application of}} diffusion-weighted images has been neurological disorders, {{especially for the}} management of acute stroke patients. However, diffusion MRI was originally developed to image the liver. In 1984, :fr:Denis Le Bihan, then a medical resident and doctoral student in physics, was asked whether MRI could possibly differentiate liver tumors from angiomas. At that time there were no clinically available MRI contrast media. Le Bihan hypothesized that a molecular <b>diffusion</b> <b>measurement</b> would result in low values for solid tumors, because of some kind of molecular movement 'restriction', while the same measure would be somewhat enhanced in flowing blood. Based on the pioneering work of Stejskal and Tanner in the 1960s he suspected that diffusion encoding could be accomplished using specific magnetic gradient pulses. However this required mixing of such pulses with those used in the MRI sequence for spatial encoding. Thus the diffusion coefficients had to be localized, or mapped on to the tissues. This had never been done before, especially in vivo, with any technique. In the first diffusion MRI paper [...] he introduced the 'b factor' (from his name, [...] "B"ihan) {{to take into account the}} existence of cross-terms between applied diffusion-sensitizing and imaging gradient pulses, and the 'apparent diffusion coefficient' (acronym ADC) concept, as [...] "diffusion" [...] measured by MRI in tissues is modulated by several mechanisms (restriction, hindrance, etc.) and other IntraVoxel Incoherent Motions (IVIM), such as blood microcirculation, etc., all the ingredients necessary to make diffusion MRI successfully working.The first images were obtained on an almost 'home-made' 0.5T scanner called 'Magniscan' by then CGR (Companie Générale de Radiologie), a French company located in Buc near Versailles in France (now GEMS European Headquarters) which patented diffusion and IVIM MRI.|$|E

40|$|The {{diffusivity}} of {{a biological}} molecule depends {{not only on}} its structure and size, but also on its environment. Thus, diffusion has been used extensively as a physical probe {{in a wide variety}} of biological applications. However, <b>diffusion</b> <b>measurements</b> based on ensemble methods are unable to reveal the underlying heterogeneity in molecular diffusivity, for example, that caused by conformational distribution or environmental changes. In this thesis, we demonstrate by specific examples that <b>diffusion</b> <b>measurements</b> by Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) at the single-molecule level are very useful in this regard. ^ First, we show that the diffusion of a fluorescent molecule trapped inside a lipid tubule, which has been shown to be a potential drug delivery vehicle, is position dependent and sometimes deviates significantly from Brownian motion. Second, we show, using a multi domain protein IgG as an example, that FCS is capable of revealing the existence of conformational species populated during the course of chemically induced protein denaturation, and that charge-charge interactions play an understated role in determining the hydrodynamic radius of the denatured protein. Third, we demonstrate that <b>diffusion</b> <b>measurements</b> at the single-molecule level are surprisingly useful in investigating the conformational distribution of membrane-bound peptides, as well as, peptide binding induced membrane domain formation. Moreover, we show that <b>diffusion</b> <b>measurements</b> can be used to study protein-ligand interactions.

40|$|Nanoporous {{molecular}} sieve materials like metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and metal oxide nanotubes (AlSiNTs) {{have found a}} wide range of technological applications in catalysis, separations, and ion exchange due to their salient features over other contemporary sensing materials. As a result, these materials can function as a chemical recognition layer that relies on analyte adsorption and they have shown to selectively adsorb specific gas molecules from mixtures. The characterization of gas adsorption in these materials is performed predominantly by commercial gravimetric equipment, whose capital and operating costs are generally high and require relatively large amounts of sample. Thus, it is desirable to obtain a reliable measure of the gas transport properties of these materials over a substantial range of pressure and temperature by non-gravimetric methods. The objective of this thesis is to investigate the adsorption and diffusion characteristics of recently-identified nanoporous materials through the development and use of a high-pressure/high-temperature quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) device.
