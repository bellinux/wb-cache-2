The fraction of <b>home</b> <b>scrap</b> in the metal charge ranged from 0 to 100 %. Castings were pressure cast by means of the hot-chamber pressure die casting machine under the industrial conditions in one of the domestic foundries. The examinations consisted in the determination of the following properties: tensile strength Rm, yield strength Rp 0. 2, and the unit elongation A 5, all being measured during the static tensile test. Also, the hardness measurements were taken by the Brinell method. It was found that the mechanical properties (mainly the strength properties) are being improved up to the <b>home</b> <b>scrap</b> fraction of 50 %. Their values were increased by about 30 % over this range. Further rise in the <b>home</b> <b>scrap</b> content, however, brought a definite decrease in these properties. The unit elongation A 5 exhibited continual decrease with an increase in the <b>home</b> <b>scrap</b> fraction in the metal charge. A large growth of hardness was noticed for the <b>home</b> <b>scrap</b> fraction increasing up to the value of 50 %. Further increasing the <b>home</b> <b>scrap</b> percentage, however, did not result in a significant rise of the hardness value any more...|$|E
40|$|The work {{presents}} the results of examinations concerning the influence of various amounts of <b>home</b> <b>scrap</b> additions on the porosity of castings made of MgAl 9 Zn 1 alloy. The fraction of <b>home</b> <b>scrap</b> in the metal charge ranged from 0 to 100 %. Castings were pressure cast by means of the hot-chamber pressure die casting machine under the industrial conditions in one of the domestic foundries. Additionally, for the purpose of comparison, the porosity of specimens cut out directly of the MgAl 9 Zn 1 ingot alloy was also determined. The examinations consisted in the qualitative assessment of porosity by means of the optical microscopy and its quantitative determination by the method of weighting specimens in air and in water. It was found during the examination that the porosity of castings decreases with an increase in the <b>home</b> <b>scrap</b> fraction in the metal charge. The qualitative examinations confirmed the beneficial influence of the increased <b>home</b> <b>scrap</b> fraction on the porosity of castings. It was concluded that the reusing of <b>home</b> <b>scrap</b> in a foundry can be a good way of reduction of costs related to the production of pressure castings...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For the {{consideration}} of energy shortage, people are paying more attention on recycling waste packaging and looking for alternatives on reusing techniques. This paper briefly introduced the recycling of house refuse, thus discussed the sorting technology of waste packaging polymers, meanwhile, it is an analysis about the technology of waste packaging polymers. Preface Along with society improvement and technological development, people's living standard is raising, the importance of packaging is undeniable. The percentage of waste packaging in <b>home</b> <b>scrap</b> is growing annually. A large number of packaging materials have short life. After one-time use, 80 % packaging wastage will be mixed into home refuse [1]. Urban house refuse generally include: food, plastic, paper, dirt, brick, grass, fabrics and metals and so on. In fact, many factors can affect components of the waste, and various factors {{on the role of}} the composition of the waste is complex. In the same region, the <b>home</b> <b>scrap</b> may have different composition; in different regions, even the same composition, home refuse is not same. However, what they have in common are: the content of waste food is the most; followed by plastic and paper, organic composition. The content of grass and glass, fabric, metal, brick decreased gradually, relatively low content in tota...|$|E
40|$|By {{means of}} a ‘Cycle of Matter’ model a {{comprehensive}} scrap cycle can be estimated for a region, country or continent. The model covers scrap flows between the three main actors defining the cycle, i. e. scrap users, scrap generators and scrap dealers. The ‘Cycle of Matter’ incorporates the generation and use of three types of scrap, i. e. <b>home</b> <b>scrap,</b> prompt scrap and obsolete scrap. It allows for a better assessment {{of the impact of}} government policies regarding scrap recycling {{in various parts of the}} scrap cycle. This paper presents the main results of a detailed study of the national scrap recycling industry of a developing country, Tanzania. The scrap flows in the ‘Cycle of Matter’ model were estimated on the basis of specially tailored surveys amongst scrap users, producers and traders, and on the basis of secondary data and coefficients derived from the literature. The paper demonstrates that the model is a powerful tool for the analysis of the scrap cycle. The study reveals that Tanzania possesses large surpluses of scrap. These surpluses are increasing over time. The scrap users — foundries and steel mills — are not capable of utilising all available scrap. Large quantities of scrap are thus either dumped in the environment or transferred abroad. Foundries and steel mills will only be able to make better use of existing scrap surpluses if they succeed in upgrading their quality of their production processes...|$|E

40|$|This report compares {{estimated}} {{production costs}} from four energy-intensive industries (steel, cement, chemical and non-ferrous metals) in the European Union and some third countries. Production costs have been estimated following a bottom-up approach, i. e. using information at facility level from a representative number of facilities. Costs are broken down to key factors, such as material, labour and energy costs and exclude capital costs (depreciation and interest). Moreover, the energy costs are estimated considering {{the effect of}} the state of technologies and the fuel mix in each country. For the iron and steel industry the production costs of hot-rolled coil and wire rod are analysed as representative flat and long products, respectively. The production costs of these products have been estimated for both the integrated route (blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace) and the recycling route (electrical arc furnace). For the chemical industry, the products analysed are ammonia, methanol, ethylene and propylene; whereas for the non-ferrous metals the analysis is focused on primary aluminium production, copper cathodes and slabs of zinc. Most of the EU 28 production costs are ranked (when compared with certain competitor countries) between the 75 th percentile and the maximum production cost. These costs are highest in the EU relative to other countries or regions in the case of flat products from the recycling route, ammonia and methanol. For long products -from the recycling route-, flat products -from the integrated route-, ethylene, propylene -refinery grade- and copper anode the EU 28 production costs are between the median (the median separates the higher half of the costs from the lower half) and the 75 th percentile of all production costs estimated. In the case of cement, the EU 28 production cost is quite similar to the value of the median cost. There are also cases in which the EU 28 production costs were among the lowest costs, namely for copper cathode and zinc slabs. It is worth noting that the contribution of energy costs to production costs is the highest in the EU only for methanol and ammonia. For all other products and industries analysed (including methanol and ammonia), other components of the cost (raw materials, labour and others or feedstock) contribute more to final costs than energy (natural gas is considered as a feedstock for methanol and ammonia). It is also noteworthy that, in most industries and products, the behaviour of credits (by-products, <b>home</b> <b>scrap,</b> electricity production from waste gases or from combined heat and power) contributes to reduce production costs more in the EU than it does in other countries or regions.

40|$|Food {{waste is}} a global problem. In Australia alone, it is {{estimated}} that households throw away AU$ 5. 2 billion worth of food (AU$ 616 per household) each year. Developed countries have formal waste management systems that provide measures of food waste. However, much remains unknown about informal food waste disposal routes and volumes outside of the formal system. This article provides indicative metrics of informal food waste by identifying, in detail, five of the dominant informal food waste disposal routes used by Australian households: <b>home</b> composting, feeding <b>scraps</b> to pets, sewer disposal, giving to charity, and dumping or incineration. Informal waste generation rates are then calculated from three primary data sources, in addition to data from previous Australian and UK surveys, using a weighted average method in conjunction with a Monte-Carlo simulation. We find that the average Australian household disposes of 2. 6 kgs of food waste per week through informal routes (1. 7 kgs via household composting, 0. 2 kgs via animals, and 0. 6 kgs via sewage). This represents 20 % of Australian household food waste flows. Our results highlight that informal food waste is a sizable food waste flow from Australian homes, deserving of greater research and government attention. Our examination of the full extent of food waste by disposal mode provides waste managers and policy makers with clear disposal routes to target for behaviour change and positive environmental outcomes...|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} the current {{decision of the}} <b>Home</b> Secre-tary to <b>scrap</b> the 43 police forces {{and replace them with}} 12 – 15 regional strategic police forces. This follows on from the recent report of HMIC, entitled Closing the Gap, published in September 2005, which was to conclude that as currently constituted the police structure for England and Wales was no longer ‘fit for purpose’. Using the ability of police services to provide an effective response to NIM Level 2 crime as a yardstick, HMIC was to find that any force with fewer than 4, 000 police officers would be unlikely to be able to provide an adequate response. One consequence of the report and the Home Secretary’s response to it has been the request made to all police author-ities and forces to present a business case to the Home Office by the end of 2005 identifying the future structure of policing in the region and the pattern of amalgamation they might favour. In the course of this exercise it was to be found that alternatives to amalgamation, collaboration and federation, had both been closed down by the Home Secretary, who has concluded that only the option of amalgamation was now acceptable to his department. Subsequently it was to be learned that a number of factors influencing HMIC’s 2005 report obtained that had not been taken into account. These included the decision on the part of HMIC specifically not to include the written section on force collaboration within the final report. Nor, it was also to be discovered, had recognition been given within the report to the expectation that implementation was to be carried out in con-junction with comprehensive Workforce Modernisation. A leaked memorandum from ODPM in late 2005 that local gov-ernment reform was now under active consideration was also to undermine the earlier assumption on the part of HMIC that n...|$|R
