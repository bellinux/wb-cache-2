Local men within the odinani Nri could represent the eze Nri and share his moral authority by purchasing a series of ranked titles called Ozo and Nze. Men with these titles were known as mbùríchi and became {{an extension of the}} Nri's religio-political system.

5|$|Psychiatry {{possesses}} {{an inherent}} capacity for abuse that {{is greater than}} {{in other areas of}} medicine. The diagnosis of mental disease can give the state license to detain persons against their will and insist upon therapy both {{in the interest of the}} detainee and in the broader interests of society. In addition, receiving a psychiatric diagnosis can in itself be regarded as oppressive. In a monolithic state, psychiatry can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing <b>guilt</b> <b>or</b> <b>innocence</b> and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials.|$|E
5|$|Labor unions, politicians, advocates, educators, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, {{and human}} rights {{advocacy}} organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have {{expressed concern about the}} impartiality of the trial of Abu-Jamal. Amnesty International neither takes a position on the <b>guilt</b> <b>or</b> <b>innocence</b> of Abu-Jamal nor classifies him as a political prisoner. They are opposed by the family of Daniel Faulkner, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the City of Philadelphia, Republican politicians, and the Fraternal Order of Police. In August 1999, the Fraternal Order of Police called for an economic boycott against all individuals and organizations that support Abu-Jamal.|$|E

Circumstantial evidence, by contrast, consists of a fact or set of facts which, if proven, will support {{the creation of an}} inference that the matter asserted is true.|$|R
60|$|Some persons {{think that}} Alexander watched the countenance of his {{physician}} {{while he was}} reading the letter, {{and that he was}} led to take the medicine by his confidence in his power to determine the <b>guilt</b> <b>or</b> the <b>innocence</b> of a person thus accused by his looks. Others suppose that the act was an expression of his implicit faith in the integrity and fidelity of his servant, and that he intended it as testimony, given in a very pointed and decisive, and, at the same time, delicate manner, that he was not suspicious of his friends, or easily led to distrust their faithfulness. Philip was, at any rate, extremely gratified at the procedure, and Alexander recovered.|$|R
40|$|General {{jurisprudence}} conceives {{the courtroom}} as {{a space of}} adjudication and justice {{far removed from the}} gravitational field of politics. Both in its normative inscription and function, the court is conceived as a site of truth and justice elevated above and beyond the expediency of power and politics. However, despite the predominance of this normative meaning, courts have been used to advance persecutive forms of politics {{that had nothing to do}} with the determination of <b>guilt</b> and <b>innocence</b> <b>or</b> the pursuit of justice. In this article, we will explore the role of the Ethiopian judiciary in legitimizing and rationalizing the politics of repression and elimination under the guise of law and legality. Drawing on Otto Kirchheimer’s seminal work on the political trial, we will examine Ethiopia’s strategic deployment of the judicial space and the devices of justice to produce narratives and generate ‘truths’ in the image of the ruling party...|$|R

One of the officers believed the brothers had betrayed them and sought to exonerate himself by notifying the queen of the failed conspiracy. She reacted by expelling the foreigners from the island and subjecting all the implicated Merina officers to the tangena ordeal in which they were forced to swallow a poison to determine their <b>guilt</b> <b>or</b> <b>innocence.</b> Rainilaiarivony and his brother were excepted from this and remained, like her son Radama, in the queen's confidence for the few remaining years of her life.|$|E

40|$|Anne Boleyn, {{the second}} wife of Henry VIII, {{has been the}} subject of fictional and nonfictional {{historical}} narratives since her execution in 1536. Although already a contentious figure for her role in Henry VIII’s annulment of his first marriage and England’s ensuing break from the Roman Catholic Church, the nature of her death ensured that she would become a focus of examination, intrigue and scrutiny. This fascination is, in part, fuelled by limited primary source materials, particularly from Boleyn’s perspective; there is an accepted, familiar narrative of her life that is defined by landmark events, however we cannot know precisely how she experienced these events. The reasons for her death are unclear because conclusive evidence confirming either her <b>guilt</b> <b>or</b> her <b>innocence</b> is yet to be uncovered. This combination of fascination and ambiguity means that Anne Boleyn is an apt case study for a consideration of the tensions between history and fiction that appear in all historical narratives. In recent decades, postmodern historiography has highlighted the literary qualities of histories, and scholars such as Hayden White have drawn attention to the narrativisation, emplotment and characterisation that occur in both fictional and non-fictional histories. The role of the historian as author—rather than as objective observer—has been integral to such scholarship. This study examines ten twenty-firstcentury historical narratives, encompassing a range of historical writing, including academic histories, popular biographies, historiographic metafiction and historical fiction. In spite of variations in style, audience, genre and veracity, each of the focus texts constructs both a characterisation of Boleyn and a narrative of her life. A close textual analysis of these narratives reveals that there are representational techniques and practices that are shared by the authors, regardless of their claims to authenticity and accuracy. Thus, the thesis rejects the apparent disjuncture between fictional and non-fictional histories on the basis of their capacity to relate truth, and argues that these texts should each be considered examples of historical writing...|$|R

25|$|By {{the twelfth}} and early thirteenth centuries, {{there was a}} shift away from the accusatorial model toward the legal {{procedure}} used in the Roman Empire. Instead of an individual making accusations based on first-hand knowledge, judges now took on the prosecutorial role based on information collected.

Still, his decisions could be reviewed by higher officials, even up to the emperor in capital cases. Since he could be reprimanded for not investigating thoroughly, for not following correct procedure, or even for writing the wrong character, magistrates in later dynasties hired specialized clerks or secretaries who had expertise in the law and bureaucratic requirements.|$|E
