5|$|First, Frederick {{had assumed}} {{he could use}} his trade-mark oblique order attack, but his {{reconnaissance}} had been incomplete. The Russians {{had been there for}} two weeks, had dug in to prepare for Frederick's arrival, and their fortifications bristled with abatis and guns. When he did arrive, Frederick had made limited efforts to assess the terrain and there was no operational reason for him not to have sent some of his cavalry to scout the area, <b>except,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> that his hussars, previously often used in reconnaissance, were being converted by Seydlitz into heavy cavalry. In the two weeks they had to prepare for the battle, the Russians and the Austrians had discovered, and reinforced, a causeway between the lakes and the marshland that allowed them to present Frederick with a united southeastern front. This effectively cancelled any advantage of the oblique battle order employed so successfully at Rossbach and Leuthen. Furthermore, the Russians utilized several natural defensive positions. The chain of hillocks could be enhanced by the construction of redans; the Russians were able to shape abutments from which to fire down upon the Prussians; they also constructed bastions, especially on the Spitzberge. Despite the murderous fire, Frederick's troops eventually turned the Russian left, but to little benefit. The terrain allowed the Russians and Austrians to form a compact front up to 100 men deep, shielded by the hills and marshes.|$|E
5|$|In 1155 {{the only}} English pope, Adrian IV, {{authorised}} King Henry II of England to {{take possession of}} Ireland as a feudal territory nominally under papal overlordship. The pope wanted the English monarch to annex Ireland and bring the Irish church into line with Rome, despite this process already underway in Ireland by 1155. An all-island kingship of Ireland had been created in 854 by Máel Sechnaill mac Máele Ruanaid. His last successor was Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, who had become King of Ireland in early 1166, and exiled Diarmait Mac Murchada, King of Leinster. Diarmait asked Henry II for help, gaining a group of Anglo-Norman aristocrats and adventurers, led by Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, to help him regain his throne. Diarmait and his Anglo-Norman allies succeeded and he became King of Leinster again. De Clare married Diarmait's daughter, and when Diarmait died in 1171, de Clare became King of Leinster. Henry was afraid that de Clare would make Ireland a rival Norman kingdom, so he {{took advantage of the}} papal bull and invaded, forcing de Clare and the other Anglo-Norman aristocrats in Ireland and the major Irish kings and lords to recognise him as their overlord. English lords came close to colonising the entire island, but a Gaelic resurgence from the 1260s resulted in the island divided between Gaelic-Irish and Anglo-Irish lords by 1400. Many of the latter became completely Gaelicised, and did not recognise England's kings <b>except</b> <b>perhaps</b> nominally. Some, such as Manus O'Donnell and Conn O'Neill, 1st Earl of Tyrone, were kings themselves.|$|E

25|$|Trypanosomes are animal parasites, {{specifically}} protozoans of {{the genus}} Trypanosoma. These organisms are {{about the size of}} red blood cells. Different species of trypanosomes infect different hosts. They range widely in their effects on the vertebrate hosts. Some species, such as T. theileri, do not seem to cause any health problems <b>except</b> <b>perhaps</b> in animals that are already sick.|$|E
2500|$|However, when Ptolemy died, {{his son and}} successor, Ptolemy Philopator {{neglected}} Cleomenes {{and eventually}} put him under house arrest. Together with his friends, he escaped his house arrest in 219 BC and tried to incite a revolt. When he received no support from the population of Alexandria, he avoided capture by committing suicide. Thus died the man who nearly conquered all of the Peloponnese and is described by William Smith as [...] "the last truly great man of Sparta, and, <b>excepting</b> <b>perhaps</b> Philopoemen, of all Greece." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{album cover}} shows {{a man in}} a suit, {{sleeping}} on a radiator, and apparently dreaming of skyscraper-beast hybrids. The cover was created from a painting by Zox and a photograph by Charlie Ganse, and was originally created for Van Morrison's unreleased 1975 album, Mechanical Bliss, the concept being a satire of the American Dream. In the liner notes for the 1999 remaster of the album, Fagen and Becker claim it to be [...] "the most hideous album cover of the seventies, bar none (<b>excepting</b> <b>perhaps</b> Can't Buy a Thrill)." ...|$|R
50|$|A gap is a {{land form}} that is a low point or opening between hills or {{mountains}} or in a ridge or mountain range. It may be called a col, notch, pass, saddle, water gap, or wind gap, and geomorphologically are most often carved by water erosion from a freshet, stream or a river. Gaps created by freshets are often, if not normally, devoid of water {{through much of the}} year, their streams being dependent upon the meltwaters of a snow pack. Gaps sourced by small springs will generally have a small stream <b>excepting</b> <b>perhaps</b> during the most arid parts of the year.|$|R
25|$|Over {{much of its}} range, {{perfoliate}} pondweed {{is unlikely to be}} confused with any other pondweed species <b>except</b> <b>perhaps</b> P. praelongus. In North America it could be confused with P. richardsonii, but the latter has stipules that disintegrate to persistent fibres even on {{the lower part of the}} stem, whereas those of P. perfoliatus disintegrate entirely.|$|E
25|$|The various sub-components of {{the index}} in {{themselves}} provide concrete suggestions for improvement. Many of them may be relatively easy to implement and uncontroversial (<b>except</b> <b>perhaps</b> among corrupt officials who may gain from onerous regulations requiring bribes to bypass). As such, the index has influenced many nations to improve their regulations. Several have explicitly targeted to reach a minimum position on the index, for example the top 25 list.|$|E
25|$|Buddhism and Protestantism {{came into}} {{political}} conflict in 19th century Sri Lanka and in Tibet c. 1904 (the Francis Younghusband Expedition). Various events have cooperated to introduce various strains of Buddhist theology and meditation to {{several generations of}} Western spiritual seekers (including some Catholic religious). Relations are generally good between both religions, <b>except</b> <b>perhaps</b> in South Korea. The Russian republic of Kalmykia recognizes both Tibetan/Lamaist Buddhism and Russian Orthodoxy as its official religions.|$|E
5000|$|An effect {{similar to}} the uncanny valley was noted by Charles Darwin in 1839: The {{expression}} of this Trigonocephalus snake’s face was hideous and fierce; the pupil consisted of a vertical slit in a mottled and coppery iris; the jaws were broad at the base, and the nose terminated in a triangular projection. I do not think I ever saw anything more ugly, <b>excepting,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> some of the vampire bats. I imagine this repulsive aspect originates from the features being placed in positions, with respect to each other, somewhat proportional to the human face; and thus we obtain a scale of hideousness.

25|$|There {{is no good}} {{evidence}} that chiropractic is effective {{for the treatment of}} any medical condition, <b>except</b> <b>perhaps</b> for certain kinds of back pain. Generally, the research carried out into the effectiveness of chiropractic has been of poor quality. Numerous controlled clinical studies of treatments used by chiropractors have been conducted, with conflicting results. Research published by chiropractors is distinctly biased. For reviews of SM for back pain chiropractic authors tend to have positive conclusions, while others did not show any effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|Maiasaura were herbivorous. They {{were capable}} of walking both on two (bipedal) or four (quadrupedal) legs. Studies of the stress {{patterns}} of healed bones show that young juveniles under four years old walked mainly bipedal, switching to a mainly quadrupedal style of walking when they grew larger. They appeared to have no defense against predators, <b>except,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> its heavy muscular tail and their herd behavior. Herds were extremely large and could have comprised as many as 10,000 individuals. Maiasaura lived in an inland habitat.|$|E

Mr. Fairlie is {{more surprised}} and disappointed {{than he can}} say (in {{the present state of}} his health) by Mr. Hartright's application. Mr. Fairlie is not a man of business, but he has consulted his steward, who is, and that person confirms Mr. Fairlie's opinion that Mr. Hartright's request to be allowed to break his engagement cannot be justified by any necessity whatever, <b>excepting</b> <b>perhaps</b> a case of life and death. If the highly-appreciative feeling towards Art and its professors, which it is the consolation and happiness of Mr. Fairlie's suffering existence to cultivate, could be easily shaken, Mr. Hartright's present proceeding would have shaken it. It has not done so--except in the instance of Mr. Hartright himself.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1st century AD, {{sterling}} qualities such {{as those}} enumerated above by Fénelon (<b>excepting</b> <b>perhaps</b> belief in the brotherhood of man) had been attributed by Tacitus in his Germania to the German barbarians, in pointed contrast to the softened, Romanized Gauls. By inference Tacitus was criticizing his own Roman culture for getting away from its roots — which was the perennial function of such comparisons. Tacitus's Germans did not inhabit a [...] "Golden Age" [...] of ease but were tough and inured to hardship, qualities which he saw as preferable to the decadent softness of civilized life. In antiquity this form of [...] "hard primitivism", whether admired or deplored (both attitudes were common), co-existed in rhetorical opposition to the [...] "soft primitivism" [...] of visions of a lost Golden Age of ease and plenty.|$|R
25|$|A more {{comprehensive}} approach to measuring cost-effectiveness or efficacy of malarial control would not only measure the cost in dollars, {{as well as the}} number of people saved, but would also consider ecological damage and negative human health impacts. One preliminary study found that {{it is likely that the}} detriment to human health approaches or exceeds the beneficial reductions in malarial cases, <b>except</b> <b>perhaps</b> in epidemics. It is similar to the earlier study regarding estimated theoretical infant mortality caused by DDT and subject to the criticism also mentioned earlier.|$|E
25|$|Spitz went to {{work for}} ABC Sports in 1976 and worked on many sports presentations, {{including}} coverage of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. In 1985 he appeared as a TV announcer in Challenge of a Lifetime. He continued as a broadcaster for some time, but within a few years, he was hardly seen as a public figure <b>except</b> <b>perhaps</b> as a commentator for swimming events like the 2004 Summer Olympics. Instead Spitz focused on his real estate company in Beverly Hills and hobbies such as sailing.|$|E
25|$|The {{second floor}} {{mezzanine}} is also presumed {{to have been}} divided into fourteen small rooms, seven rooms along {{each side of the}} North and South walls of the building, between the arched ceiling of the second floor. Circular windows in the entablature of the building allowed for illumination. Just as with the second floor assembly room, {{there is no evidence that}} these rooms were ever completed, <b>except</b> <b>perhaps</b> for the partitions dividing each room. There was a staircase in the second room from the Southeast corner leading to a room above, providing another access method to the attic.|$|E
5000|$|The {{album cover}} {{features}} a photomontage by Robert Lockart. It includes {{an image of}} a line of prostitutes, standing in a red light area waiting for clients, chosen because of its relevance to the album title. The title of the album is taken in reference to the opening line of the Bob Dylan song [...] "It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry". Walter Becker and Donald Fagen themselves commented on the album art in their liner notes to the reissued The Royal Scam, saying that the album possessed [...] "the most hideous album cover of the seventies, bar none (<b>excepting</b> <b>perhaps</b> Can't Buy a Thrill)." [...] The cover was banned in Francisco Franco's Spain and was replaced with a photograph of the band playing in concert.|$|R

2500|$|Burke's Reflections {{sparked a}} {{pamphlet}} war. Mary Wollstonecraft {{was one of}} the first into print, publishing A Vindication of the Rights of Men a few weeks after Burke. Thomas Paine followed with the Rights of Man in 1791. James Mackintosh, who wrote Vindiciae Gallicae, was the first to see the Reflections as [...] "the manifesto of a Counter Revolution". Mackintosh later agreed with Burke's views, remarking in December 1796 after meeting him, that Burke was [...] "minutely and accurately informed, to a wonderful exactness, with respect to every fact relating to the French Revolution". Mackintosh later said: [...] "Burke {{was one of the}} first thinkers as well as one of the greatest orators of his time. He is without parallel in any age, <b>excepting</b> <b>perhaps</b> Lord Bacon and Cicero; and his works contain an ampler store of political and moral wisdom than can be found in any other writer whatever".|$|R
25|$|Most {{of these}} {{techniques}} were developed during World War II or earlier, and {{have been used to}} some degree in every conflict since. Daniel Lerner was in the OSS (the predecessor to the American CIA) and in his book, attempts to analyze how effective the various strategies were. He concludes that {{there is little evidence that}} any of them were dramatically successful, <b>except</b> <b>perhaps</b> surrender instructions over loudspeakers when victory was imminent. It should be noted, though, that measuring the success or failure of psychological warfare is very hard, as the conditions are very far from being a controlled experiment.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the greater}} part of the 13th century a state of {{comparative}} peace existed at Tallaght, but subsequently the O'Byrnes and O'Tooles, in what would become County Wicklow, took offensive action and were joined by many of the Archbishop's tenants. As a result of this the land was not tilled, the pastures were not stocked and the holdings were deserted. In 1310 the bailiffs of Tallaght got a royal grant to enclose the town. No trace of these defensive walls survive and {{there is no evidence of}} their exact location, <b>except,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> for the name of the Watergate Bridge which spans the Dodder on the Oldbawn Road.|$|E
25|$|Tabari {{was some}} {{fifty years old}} when al-Mu'tadid became caliph. He was well past seventy in the year his History was published. During the {{intervening}} years, he was famous, if somewhat controversial, personality. Among the figures of his age, he had access to sources of information equal to anyone, <b>except,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> those who were directly connected with decision making within the government. Most, if not all, the materials for the histories of al-Mu'tadid, al-Muktafi, and {{the early years of}} al-Muqtadir were collected by him about the time the reported events took place. His accounts are as authentic as one can expect from that period.|$|E
6000|$|In the {{character}} of Ventidius, Dryden has filled up, with ability, the rude sketches, which Shakespeare has thrown off in those of Scæva and Eros. The rough old Roman soldier is painted with great truth; and the quarrel betwixt him and Antony, in the first act, is equal to any single scene that our author ever wrote, <b>excepting,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> that betwixt Sebastian and Dorax; an opinion in which {{the judgment of the}} critic coincides with that of the poet. It is a pity, as has often been remarked, that this dialogue occurs so early in the play, since what follows is necessarily inferior in force. Dryden, while writing this scene, had unquestionably in his recollection the quarrel betwixt Brutus and Cassius, which was justly so great a favourite in his time, and to which he had referred as inimitable in his prologue to [...] "Aureng-Zebe.[2]" ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{may be as}} well to say at {{once that}} the house was all that an hotel ought to be, <b>excepting,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> that the prices were a little high. The two sitting-rooms and the two bedrooms--with the maid's room, which had also been taken--did seem to be very heavy to Rachel, who knew down to a shilling--or rather, to a dollar, as she would have said--how much her father had in his pocket. Indefinite {{promises}} of great wealth had been also made to herself; but according to a scale suggested by Mr. Moss, a pound a night, out of which she would have to keep herself, was the remuneration immediately promised. Then a sudden thought struck Miss O'Mahony. They were still standing discussing the price in one of the sitting-rooms, and Mr. Moss was also there. [...] "Father," [...] she said, [...] "I'm sure that Frank would not approve." ...|$|R
50|$|A conodont, Promissum had a {{primitive}} mouth under its eyes with mineralized teeth, which are both typical for conodonts.
