40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} the recent application of passive samplers for the sampling of low concentration organic vapours in <b>indoor</b> and ambient <b>air.</b> Theoretical equations describing the operation of various types of passive samplers are summarized. The problems associated with the application of passive samplers for the sampling of organic vapours in <b>indoor</b> and ambient <b>air,</b> and the factors affecting the performance of passive samplers are discussed. It is suggested the effective cross-sectional area be employed in calculating the diffusion uptake rate according to DA/L instead of the total cross-sectional area. It is further suggested that suitable passive samplers with a higher uptake rate should be designed (e. g. by reducing the diffusion length), and a new and simple validation procedure should be developed for their application in <b>indoor</b> and ambient <b>air</b> environments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction: Airborne {{pollution}} in such public environments as schools has {{adverse health effects}} on pupils and teachers who spend a noticeable {{amount of time in}} the school. Therefore, this study aimed to measure the suspended particles concentration of <b>indoor</b> and outdoor <b>air</b> of Yazd schools as well as to determine the influencing parameters on the {{pollution in}}tensity. Methods: This analytical cross-sectional study was conducted in 20 middle-schools and high schools of males and females in winter of 2013. The environmental aerosol monitoring device, (HAZ-DUST EPAM 5000 model) was used to measure the concentration of PM 1, PM 2. 5 and PM 10. The study data were analyzed via applying correlation, simple linear regression and means comparison tests. Moreover, the study results were compared with the standards of World health organization(WHO) and Environmental Health Organization(EPA). Results: The mean concentration of PM 10, PM 2. 5 and PM 1 in <b>indoor</b> class <b>air</b> was reported higher compared to the outdoor <b>air.</b> The <b>indoor</b> and outdoor <b>air</b> quality of schools in terms of Air Quality Index 9 (AQI Calculator) indicated an average condition for PM 10, and an unhealthy condition for PM 2. 5 in regard with the vulnerable groups. A significant relationship was detected between <b>indoor</b> and outdoor <b>air</b> concentration particles (P< 0. 05). The mean <b>indoor</b> per outdoor <b>air</b> particles ratio (I/O) was 1. 68, 1. 31, 1. 46 respectively for PM 10, PM 2. 5, PM 1. Conclusion: The study findings revealed a significant relationship between indoor and outdoor suspended particle concentration demonstrating the particles penetration into the classrooms. Therefore, utilizing appropriate air conditioner systems are regarded effective in order to mitigate indoor class pollution.  ...|$|R

Most of these studies have used indirect measures of exposure and generally dealt inadequately with confounding. More reliable, quantified information about this presumed effect is an important pre-requisite for prevention, not least because of the technical, economic and cultural barriers to achieving substantial exposure reductions in the world’s poorest households, where ambient pollution levels are typically between ten and a hundred times higher than recommended standards. This study was carried out as part of a programme of research designed to inform the development of intervention studies capable of providing quantified estimates of health benefits...|$|R
