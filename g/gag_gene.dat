25|$|HIV {{has several}} major genes coding for {{structural}} proteins {{that are found}} in all retroviruses {{as well as several}} nonstructural ("accessory") genes unique to HIV. The HIV genome contains three major genes, 5'gag-pol-env-3', encoding major structural proteins as well as essential enzymes. These are synthesized as polyproteins which produce proteins for virion interior, called Gag, group specific antigen; the viral enzymes (Pol, polymerase) or the glycoproteins of the virion env (envelope). In addition to these, HIV encodes for proteins which have certain regulatory and auxiliary functions as well. HIV-1 has two important regulatory elements: Tat and Rev and few important accessory proteins such as Nef, Vpr, Vif and Vpu which are not essential for replication in certain tissues. The <b>gag</b> <b>gene</b> provides the basic physical infrastructure of the virus, and pol provides the basic mechanism by which retroviruses reproduce, while the others help HIV to enter the host cell and enhance its reproduction. Though they may be altered by mutation, all of these genes except tev exist in all known variants of HIV; see Genetic variability of HIV.|$|E
50|$|The <b>gag</b> <b>gene</b> encodes three final {{glycoprotein}} products: the capsid, the nucleocapsid, and {{the matrix}} protein which links the capsid and the envelope.|$|E
50|$|After a virus {{enters a}} target cell, the viral genome is {{integrated}} into the host cell chromatin. RNA polymerase II then transcribes the 9181 nucleotide full-length viral RNA. HIV Gag protein is encoded by the HIV <b>gag</b> <b>gene,</b> HXB2 nucleotides 790-2292.|$|E
40|$|Seven {{isolates}} of feline {{immunodeficiency virus}} (FIV), Shizuoka, Yokohama, Sendai- 1, Sendai- 2, Fukuoka, Aomori- 1, and Aomori- 2, were isolated from FIV-seropositive domestic cats in Japan, and their proviral DNAs were amplified by PCR. The nucleotide sequences of their env and <b>gag</b> <b>genes</b> were determined and {{compared with those}} of previously described isolates: U. S. and European isolates and one Japanese isolate, TM 2. Phylogenetic analyses of complete env gene sequences demonstrate that worldwide isolates are classified into three subtypes: Japanese TM 2, Japanese Shizuoka, and non-Japanese subtypes (U. S. and European isolates), with 20 % amino acid distances from each other. This pattern indicates that an evolutionary radiation of these three subtypes of FIV occurred at approximately the same time. The sequence data of <b>gag</b> <b>genes</b> also confirmed these results. Furthermore, the Sendai- 1 isolate was identified as an imported FIV isolate...|$|R
50|$|<b>Gag</b> <b>genes</b> {{are part}} of a general {{architecture}} for retroviruses, viruses that replicate through reverse transcription, where the gag region of the genome encodes proteins that constitute the matrix, capsid and nucleocapsid of the mature virus particles. Like in HIV's replication cycle, these proteins are needed for viral budding from the host cell's plasma membrane, where the fully formed virions leave the cell to infect other cells.|$|R
40|$|Transmission {{of human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) from a male accused of rape and deliberate transmission of HIV- 1 was investigated by sequencing of the HIV- 1 pol and <b>gag</b> <b>genes</b> from virus obtained from the male and from the female victim. Parts of the reverse transcriptase and p 17 <b>gag</b> <b>genes</b> were amplified and directly sequenced from uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The sequences were compared with sequences from 21 unrelated HIV- 1 -infected controls from the same geographic area (Stockholm, Sweden). Bootstrap analysis of phylogenetic trees demonstrated that the sequences from the female were significantly {{more closely related to}} the sequences from the male than to sequences from the controls. Furthermore, we found that the male and female shared two distinct genetic variants of HIV- 1. In p 17 gag the major variant had an unusual, out-of-frame deletion of 3 nucleotides which the minor variant lacked. These results indicated that the male had transmitted more than one infectious unit to the female. From this study we concluded that it was highly likely that the HIV- 1 strains carried by the male and female were closely epidemiologically linked...|$|R
50|$|The other region, {{composed}} of 132 nucleotide base pairs, is {{located within the}} <b>gag</b> <b>gene</b> between nucleotides 1015 and 1147. This region, {{also known as the}} secondary signal, will facilitate RNA encapsidation if the primary region is present and fully functional.|$|E
50|$|The {{encapsidation}} (packaging) {{signal of}} BLV {{is made up}} of two regions. One of the regions (nucleotides 551 to 698) includes 147 base pairs beginning after the primer binding site and ending just after the start of the <b>gag</b> <b>gene</b> (nucleotide 628). This region is called the primary signal and is essential for viral replication to occur.|$|E
50|$|Before its discovery, the {{location}} of the encapsidation (packaging) signal within the bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) was suggested by Manksy et al. to either be “between the major splice donor site (in the r region of the viral RNA) and the gag start codon or between the primer binding site (located just downstream of the 5’ LTR) and the gag start codon.” In 1994, researchers from the University of Wisconsin Medical School made mutations in various locations of BLV through a process known as deletion analysis to determine if viral replication efficiency would be affected. They found mutants made with deletions in the 5’ end of the <b>gag</b> <b>gene</b> and in the 5’ untranslated leader region had a 7-fold and a 50-fold decrease in replication respectively. In contrast, they did not find a significant decrease in viral replication in mutants made with deletions in the 3’ end of the <b>gag</b> <b>gene.</b> These results suggest there are two regions within BLV necessary for successful RNA encapsidation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mechanism}} of expression for HERV-W genes {{is still not}} completely understood. The 780 bp LTR’s that flank the env, pro, pol and <b>gag,</b> <b>genes</b> provide a range of regulatory sequences such as promoters, enhancers, and transcription factor binding sites. [...] The 5’ U3 region acts as a promoter and the 3’ R acts as a poly A signal. [...] It would be {{reasonable to assume that}} HERV-W genes could not be transcribed from HERV-W elements that have incomplete LTRs.|$|R
40|$|The {{lineage of}} HIV- 2 -like viruses was studied in feral sooty mangabeys (SMs) by {{serological}} and genetic methods. Four feral sooty mangabeys were positive for simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) antibodies {{and a new}} isolate, SIVsmSL 92 a, was obtained. Genetic analysis of <b>gag</b> <b>genes</b> showed that SIVsmSL 92 a was highly diverse and a distinct sequence subtype within the SIV sm/HIV- 2 family. The results showed that SIVsm is the most diverse group of SIVs found thus far in a single monkey species. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
5000|$|This data {{suggests}} HERV-W env and <b>gag</b> <b>genes</b> in MS patients {{either have}} a distinct regulation of their inherited HERV-W copies or that HERV-W is infectious in MS patients. By examining {{the regulation of}} a synctin-1 promoter the Mameli Lab was able {{to better understand the}} mechanism for ERVWE1 regulation in nerve tissue. They found through a CHIP assay that TNFa (a cytokine) causes the p65 transcription factor to bind to the promoter. This was confirmed by deleting the cellular enhancer, where p65 binds, which resulted in less transcription ...|$|R
5000|$|ASLV is genetically {{closely related}} to the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), but unlike RSV, ASLV does not contain the src gene, which codes for a {{tyrosine}} kinase, and does not transform the fibroblasts that it infects. [...] Both RSV and ASLV contain the <b>gag</b> <b>gene,</b> which is common to most retroviruses and encodes for the capsid proteins, and the pol gene which encodes for the reverse transcriptase enzyme. ASLV and some RSVs also contain the env gene, which encodes a precursor polyprotein that assembles in the endoplasmic reticulum. The polyproteins are then transported to the Golgi apparatus, glycosylated and cleaved to produce two glycoproteins: one surface and one transmembrane.|$|E

5000|$|While {{transcription}} was classically {{thought to}} occur only from DNA to RNA, reverse transcriptase transcribes RNA into DNA. The term [...] "retro" [...] in retrovirus {{refers to this}} reversal (making DNA from RNA) of the central dogma of molecular biology. Reverse transcriptase activity outside of retroviruses {{has been found in}} almost all eukaryotes, enabling the generation and insertion of new copies of retrotransposons into the host genome. These inserts are transcribed by enzymes of the host into new RNA molecules that enter the cytosol. Next, some of these RNA molecules are translated into viral proteins. For example, the <b>gag</b> <b>gene</b> is translated into molecules of the capsid protein, the pol gene is translated into molecules of reverse transcriptase, and the env gene is translated into molecules of the envelope protein. It {{is important to note that}} a retrovirus must [...] "bring" [...] its own reverse transcriptase in its capsid, otherwise it is unable to utilize the enzymes of the infected cell to carry out the task, due to the unusual nature of producing DNA from RNA.|$|E
50|$|From {{preclinical}} results (using SHIV) 96% {{of primates}} (22/23) were {{protected from the}} virus over a {{three and a half}} year period when vaccinated, while by contrast five out of six primates died within eight months after being infected when left untreated. The vaccine works with a combined DNA vaccine and MVA (modified vaccinia Ankara) vaccine both of which lead to the insertion of genes into primate DNA which leads to foreign protein expression. With the GeoVax vaccine a variety of HIV proteins (both surface and internal) are expressed from genes which include the Env, Pol and <b>Gag</b> <b>genes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Retroviruses can be {{retrained}} {{to attach}} to cells and replace DNA. They {{go through a}} process called reverse transcription to deliver genetic packaging in a vector. Usually, these devices are Pol - <b>Gag</b> <b>genes</b> of the virus for the Capsid and Delivery system. This process is called retroviral gene therapy, having the ability to re-engineer cellular DNA by usage of viral vectors. This approach {{has appeared in the}} form of retroviral, adenoviral, and lentiviral gene delivery systems. These gene therapy vectors have been used in cats to send genes into the genetically modified organism (GMO), causing it to display the trait.|$|R

50|$|It is {{also known}} that the {{encapsidation}} (packaging) signal {{is made up of}} secondary structures. There are two stable stem-loop structures in the primary region and one stem-loop structure in the secondary region. The two primary stem-loops are located in the matrix (MA) domain of the <b>gag</b> <b>gene,</b> downstream of the start codon, while the secondary signal stem-loop is found in the capsid (CA) domain of gag. It is known when mutations in the primary region make one of its stem-loops inoperable, viral replication decreases by a factor of 7. Also, replication decreases 40-fold when neither primary signal stem-loop is properly functioning, creating a phenotype similar to BLV strains that do not have a primary signal region. A similar effect is found in the secondary signal stem-loop, where mutations in this region reduce viral replication 4 to 6 times. However, it has also been found that replication rates of mutant BLV strains can be reestablished to normal levels by implementing counter mutations. Furthermore, when the encapsidation signal regions of type 1 or type 2 human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV), a virus within the same family as BLV, replace these mutated primary and secondary regions of mutated BLV, replication improves, implying the encapsidation regions of HTLV and BLV are homologous. Chimeric forms of BLV RNA are also not as efficient, suggesting secondary and tertiary structures of these encapsidation regions are important for replication success.|$|E
40|$|Clonal {{isolates}} of {{an early}} passage stock of woolly monkey sarcoma virus (WSV) {{have been shown to}} code for different numbers of woolly monkey helper leukemia virus <b>gag</b> <b>gene</b> products. In the present report, the molecular mechanisms responsible for their differential expression of <b>gag</b> <b>gene</b> products have been analyzed. Three WSV RNA genomes were shown to possess sedimentation coefficients consistent with the differences demonstrated in their allotments of helper viral sequences. The WSV variant (WSV clone 9) that expressed no detectable proteins was shown to contain the largest amount of helper viral information. Moreover, there was no additive hybridization of the WLV complementary DNA probe by RNA of this WSV clone and that of a WSV clone coding for several <b>gag</b> <b>gene</b> products. These results suggest that the lack of expression of <b>gag</b> <b>gene</b> products by WSV clone 9 is not due to a major deletion of helper viral <b>gag</b> <b>gene</b> sequences. Similar levels of WLV-specific RNA were demonstrated in cells nonproductively transformed by each WSV clone, arguing that the ability to express <b>gag</b> <b>gene</b> proteins was not related to the magnitude of viral RNA transcription. Taken together, the results are most consistent with a mechanism by which small deletions or point mutations in the genomes of some WSV variants result in premature termination of translation or synthesis of immunologically nonreactive <b>gag</b> <b>gene</b> proteins. The present findings have implications concerning the effects of evolutionary selective pressures on helper viral genetic information in mammalian transforming viruses...|$|E
40|$|An RNA-based, non-cytopathic {{replicon}} vector system, {{based on}} the flavivirus Kunjin, has shown considerable promise as a new vaccine delivery system. Here we describe the testing in mice of four different SIVmac 239 gag vaccines delivered by Kunjin replicon virus-like-particles. The four vaccines encoded the wild type <b>gag</b> <b>gene,</b> an RNA-optimised <b>gag</b> <b>gene,</b> a codon-optimised <b>gag</b> <b>gene</b> and a modified gag-pol gene construct. The vaccines behaved quite differently for induction of effector memory and central memory responses, for mediation of protection, and with respect to insert stability, with the SIV gag-pol vaccine providing the optimal performance. These results illustrate that for an RNA-based vector the RNA sequence of the antigen can have profound and unforeseen consequences on vaccine behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Sequences {{homologous}} to {{the human}} endogenous retrovirus (HERV) family HERV-K(HML- 2) are present in all Old World primate species. A previous study showed that a central region of the HERV-K(HML- 2) <b>gag</b> <b>genes</b> in Hominoidea species displays a 96 -bp deletion compared to the <b>gag</b> <b>genes</b> in lower Old World primates. The more ancient HERV-K(HML- 2) sequences present in lower Old World primates were apparently not conserved during hominoid evolution, {{as opposed to the}} deletion variants. To further clarify the evolutionary origin of the HERV-K(HML- 2) family, we screened GenBank with the 96 -bp gag-sequence characteristic of lower Old World primates and identified, to date, 10 human sequence entries harboring either full-length or partially deleted proviral structures, probably representing remnants of a more ancient HERV-K(HML- 2) variant. The high degree of mutations demonstrates the long-time presence of these HERV-K(OLD) proviruses in the genome. Nevertheless, they still belong to the HML- 2 family as deduced from dot matrix and phylogenetic analyses. We estimate, based on the family ages of integrated Alu elements and on long terminal repeat (LTR) divergence data, that the average age of HERV-K(OLD) proviruses is ca. 28 million years, supporting an integration time before the evolutionary split of Hominoidea from lower Old World primates. Analysis of HERV-K(OLD) LTR sequences led to the distinction of two subgroups, both of which cluster with LTRs belonging to an evolutionarily older cluster. Taken together, our data give further insight into the evolutionary history of the HERV-K(HML- 2) family during primate evolution...|$|R

In this strain, the normally overlapping open reading frames IV and V, {{corresponding to the}} retrovirus <b>gag</b> and pol <b>genes,</b> are separated by a short intergenic region, suggesting that in this virus and in contrast to retroviruses, fusion of <b>gag</b> and pol <b>gene</b> products is not obligatory...|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} cross-clade HIV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity in peripheral blood of eight Zambian individuals infected with non-B-clade {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1). Heteroduplex mobility assay and partial sequence analysis of env and <b>gag</b> <b>genes</b> strongly suggests that all the HIV-infected subjects were infected with clade C HIV- 1. Six of eight C-clade HIV-infected individuals elicited CTL activity specific for recombinant vaccinia virus-infected autologous targets expressing HIV gag-pol-env derived from B-clade HIV- 1 (IIIB). Recognition of individual recombinant HIV- 1 B-clade vaccinia virus-infected targets expressing gag, pol, or env was variable among the patients tested, indicating that cross-clade CTL activity {{is not limited to}} a single HIV protein. These data demonstrate that HIV clade C-infected individuals can mount vigorous HIV clade B-reactive CTL responses...|$|R
40|$|Sheep were immunized against Visna/Maedi virus (VMV) gag and/or env genes via the nasopharynx-associated {{lymphoid tissue}} (NALT) and lung using polyethylenimine (PEI) -DNA {{complexes}} and modified vaccinia Ankara, and challenged with live virus via the lung. env immunization enhanced humoral responses prior to but not after VMV challenge. Systemic T cell proliferative and cytotoxic responses were generally low, with the responses following single <b>gag</b> <b>gene</b> immunization being significantly depressed after challenge. A transient reduction in provirus load {{in the blood}} early after challenge was observed following env immunization, whilst the <b>gag</b> <b>gene</b> either alone or in combination with env resulted in significantly elevated provirus loads in lung. However, despite this, {{a significant reduction in}} lesion score was observed in animals immunized with the single <b>gag</b> <b>gene</b> at post-mortem. Inclusion of IFN-gamma in the immunization mixture in general had no significant effects. The results thus showed that protective effects against VMV-induced lesions can be induced following respiratory immunization with the single <b>gag</b> <b>gene,</b> though this was accompanied by an increased pulmonary provirus load...|$|E
40|$|A 41 -kDa {{unprocessed}} {{human immunodeficiency}} virus 2 (HIV- 2) gag precursor protein that has a deletion of {{a portion of the}} viral protease assembles as virus-like particles by budding through the cytoplasmic membrane of recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells. We have constructed six different combinations of chimeric genes by coupling the truncated HIV- 2 <b>gag</b> <b>gene</b> to the neutralizing domain (V 3) or the neutralizing and the CD 4 binding domains (V 3 +CD 4 BD) of gp 120 env gene sequences from HIV- 1 or HIV- 2. The env gene sequences were inserted either {{into the middle of the}} <b>gag</b> <b>gene</b> or at the 3 ' terminus of the <b>gag</b> <b>gene.</b> Virus-like particles were formed by chimeric gene products only when the env gene sequences were linked to the 3 ' terminus of the <b>gag</b> <b>gene.</b> Insertion of env gene sequence in the middle of the <b>gag</b> <b>gene</b> resulted in high-level chimeric gene expression but without the formation of virus-like particles. Three different chimeric genes [gag gene with HIV- 1 V 3 (1 V 3), <b>gag</b> <b>gene</b> with HIV- 2 V 3 (2 V 3), and <b>gag</b> <b>gene</b> with HIV- 2 V 3 +CD 4 BD (2 V 3 +CD 4 BD) ] formed virus-like particles that were secreted into the cell culture medium. In contrast, the HIV- 1 V 3 +CD 4 BD/HIV- 2 gag construct did not form virus-like particles. The chimeric gag-env particles had spherical morphology and the size was slightly larger than that of the gag particles, but the chimeric particles were similar to the mature HIV particles. Western blot analysis showed that the gag-env chimeric proteins were recognized by antibodies in HIV-positive human serum and rabbit anti-gp 120 serum. Rabbit anti-gag 1 V 3 and anti-gag 2 V 3 sera reacted with authentic gp 120 of HIV- 1 and HIV- 2, respectively, and neutralized homologous HIV infectivity. Our results show that precursor gag protein has potential as a carrier for the presentation of foreign epitopes in good immunological context. The gag protein is highly immunogenic and has the ability to carry large foreign inserts; as such, it offers an attractive approach for HIV vaccine development...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{whether the}} MuSVts 110 <b>gag</b> <b>gene</b> product (P 58 gag) can regulate the novel growth temperature dependence of MuSVts 110 RNA splicing. MuSVts 110 mutants with either frameshifts or deletions in the <b>gag</b> <b>gene</b> were tested {{for their ability}} to maintain the MuSVts 110 splicing phenotype. Only small decreases in splicing efficiency and no changes in the thermosensitivity of viral RNA splicing were observed in MuSVts 110 <b>gag</b> <b>gene</b> frameshift mutants. Deletions within the <b>gag</b> <b>gene,</b> however, variably decreased MuSVts 110 splicing efficiency but had no effect on its thermosensitivity. Another class of MuSVts 110 splicing mutants generated by treatment of MuSVts 110 -infected cells with NiCl 2 was also examined. In these "nickel revertants," P 58 gag is made, but splicing of the viral transcript is nearly complete at all growth temperatures. The splicing of "tagged" viral RNA transcribed from a modified MuSVts 110 DNA introduced into nickel revertant cells remained thermosensitive, arguing against trans effects of viral gene products on splicing efficiency. These experiments indicated that neither the MuSVts 110 P 58 gag protein nor any other viral gene product acts in trans to regulate MuSVts 110 splicing...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{developed}} an AIDS vaccine based on attenuated VSV vectors expressing env and <b>gag</b> <b>genes</b> and tested it in rhesus monkeys. Boosting was accomplished using vectors with glycoproteins from different VSV serotypes. Animals were challenged with a pathogenic AIDS virus (SHIV 89. 6 P). Control monkeys showed a severe loss of CD 4 + T cells and high viral loads, and 7 / 8 progressed to AIDS {{with an average}} time of 148 days. All seven vaccinees were initially infected with SHIV 89. 6 P but have remained healthy for up to 14 months after challenge with low or undetectable viral loads. Protection from AIDS was highly significant (p = 0. 001). VSV vectors are promising candidates for human AIDS vaccine trials because they propagate to high titers and can be delivered without injection...|$|R
40|$|We {{constructed}} recombinant feline herpesviruses (FHVs) {{expressing the}} envelope (env) and <b>gag</b> <b>genes</b> of {{feline leukemia virus}} (FeLV). Expression cassettes, utilizing the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter, were inserted within the thymidine kinase gene of FHV. The FeLV env glycoprotein expressed by recombinant FHV was processed and transported to the cell surface much as in FeLV infection, with the exception that proteolytic processing to yield the mature gp 70 and p 15 E proteins was less efficient {{in the context of}} herpesvirus infection. Glycosylation of the env protein was not affected; modification continued in the absence of efficient proteolytic processing to generate terminally glycosylated gp 85 and gp 70 proteins. A recombinant FHV containing the FeLV <b>gag</b> and protease <b>genes</b> expressed both <b>gag</b> and gag-protease precursor proteins. Functional protease was produced which mediated the proteolytic maturation of the FeLV gag proteins as in authentic FeLV infection. Use of these recombinant FHVs as live-virus vaccines may provide insight as to the role of specific retroviral proteins in protective immunity. The current use of conventional attenuated FHV vaccines speaks to the wider potential of recombinant FHVs for vaccination in cats...|$|R
40|$|The coding {{capacity}} for retroviral Gag and Env proteins has been maintained in human endogenous retroviruses of the HERV-K family. HERV-K homologous sequences {{have been found}} in all Old World primates. Here, we examined Old World primate species for the presence of full-length HERV-K <b>gag</b> and env <b>genes</b> and the presence of gag and env open reading frames as determined by the protein truncation test. Full-length HERV-K env genes were found in DNAs of all Old World primate species, whereas open reading frames for Env protein were found solely in human, chimpanzee, and gorilla DNAs. The mutational event leading to two HERV-K types was found to have occurred after the separation of hominids from lower Old World primates and before the expansion of hominids. Full-length HERV-K <b>gag</b> <b>genes</b> in hominids displayed a 96 -bp deletion compared to those in lower Old World primates. The ancient gag variant has not been maintained during hominid evolution. Open reading frames for HERV-K Gag {{have been found in}} all Old World primates except chimpanzees.

Approach: Fifty seven DNA samples isolated from PBMCs and BAW of naturally infected animals were used for a nested PCR amplifying a 408 bp <b>gag</b> <b>gene</b> fragment region. Equine Dermal cells (ED) infected and non infected by EIAV was used as nested PCR negative and positive control.

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 serotype C {{was found in}} 545 of 712 Ethiopian patients by peptide enzyme immunoassay. Serotyping failed in 146 samples due {{to the absence of}} V 3 antibodies or multiple reactivities. In 6 of 34 samples, discordant results were obtained by serotyping and genotyping, possibly due to divergent V 3 sequences. At least nine human {{immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) subtypes have been identified (7, 9). Subtyping can be per-formed by serotyping or genotyping. For genotyping, sequenc-ing of env and/or <b>gag</b> <b>genes</b> has been used (9). Serotyping using V 3 peptides is possible because of the difference in avidity between subtype-specific and cross-reactive antibody binding (3, 10, 13).
