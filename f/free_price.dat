50|$|Market economies do not logically presuppose the {{existence}} of private ownership {{of the means of}} production. A market economy can and often does include various types of cooperatives, collectives, or autonomous state agencies that acquire and exchange capital goods in capital markets. These all utilize a market-determined <b>free</b> <b>price</b> system to allocate capital goods and labor. In addition, there are many variations of market socialism, some of which involve employee-owned enterprises based on self-management; as well as models that involve the combination of public ownership of the means of production with factor markets.|$|E

We stress the structural changes in tariffs occurred in privatized sectors, the backward-looking behavior of administered prices, the exchange rate pass-through to these prices, the trajectory of international oil prices and {{the differences between the}} general price indexes and the consumer price indexes. Using a simple regression, we identify the general price index known as IGP-DI as the most important factor to explain the different behavior of <b>free</b> <b>prices</b> and administered prices.

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{models of}} neoclassical socialism {{were developed by}} Leon Walras, Enrico Barone (1908) and Oskar R. Lange (c. 1936). Lange and Fred M. Taylor (1929) proposed that central planning boards set prices through [...] "trial and error", making adjustments as shortages and surpluses occurred {{rather than relying on}} a <b>free</b> <b>price</b> mechanism. If there were shortages, prices would be raised; if there were surpluses, prices would be lowered. Raising the prices would encourage businesses to increase production, driven by their desire to increase their profits, and in doing so eliminate the shortage. Lowering the prices would encourage businesses to curtail production to prevent losses, which would eliminate the surplus. Therefore, it would be a simulation of the market mechanism, which Lange thought would be capable of effectively managing supply and demand.|$|E
50|$|Economic {{liberalism}} opposes {{government intervention}} {{on the grounds}} that the state often serves dominant business interests, distorting the market to their favor and thus leading to inefficient outcomes. Ordoliberalism and various schools of social liberalism based on classical liberalism include a broader role for the state, but do not seek to replace private enterprise and the free-market with public enterprise and economic planning. For example, a social market economy is a largely free-market economy based on a <b>free</b> <b>price</b> system and private property, but is supportive of government activity to promote competitive markets and social welfare programs to address social inequalities that result from free-market outcomes. Economic liberalism also includes support for equality of opportunity (also known as social mobility), due to the belief that a lack of equality of opportunity will lead to an increase in private monopoly and therefore infringed liberty of individuals.|$|E
50|$|In El Salvador, {{there was}} {{frequent}} intermarriage between black male slaves and Amerindian women. Many of these slaves intermarried with Amerindian women {{in hopes of}} gaining freedom (if not for themselves, then their offspring). Many mixed African and Amerindian children resulted from these unions. The Spanish tried to prevent such Afro-Amerindian unions, but the mixing {{of the two groups}} could not be prevented. Slaves continued to pursue natives with the prospect of freedom. According to Richard Price's book Maroon Societies (1979), it is documented that during the colonial period that Amerindian women would rather marry black men than Amerindian men, and that black men would rather marry Amerindian women than black women so that their children will be born <b>free.</b> <b>Price</b> quoted this from a history by H.H. Bancroft published in 1877 referring to colonial Mexico. El Salvador's African population lived under similar circumstances, and the mixing between black men and native women was common during colonial times.|$|E

5000|$|In the book, Lange {{advocated}} {{the use of}} market tools (especially the neoclassical pricing theory) in economic planning of socialism and Marxism. He proposed that central planning boards set prices through [...] "trial and error", making adjustments as shortages and surpluses occur {{rather than relying on}} a <b>free</b> <b>price</b> mechanism. Under this system, central planners would arbitrarily pick a price for products manufactured in government factories and raise it or reduce, depending on whether it resulted in shortages or gluts. After this economic experiment had been run a few times, mathematical methods would be employed to plan the economy: if there were shortages, prices would be raised; if there were surpluses, prices would be lowered. Raising the prices would encourage businesses to increase production, driven by their desire to increase profits, and in doing so eliminate the shortage. Lowering the prices would encourage businesses to curtail production in order to prevent losses, which would eliminate the surplus. In Lange's opinion, such simulation of market mechanism would be capable of effectively managing supply and demand. Proponents of this idea argued that it combines the advantages of a market economy with those of socialist economy.|$|E
