500|$|On August 10, 1978 three {{teenage girls}} of the Urlich family of Osceola, Indiana {{were killed when}} the 1973 Pinto they were in was {{involved}} in a rear-end collision. [...] The driver had stopped in the road to retrieve the car's gas cap which had been inadvertently left {{on the top of the}} car and subsequently fell onto the road. [...] While stopped the Pinto was struck by a Chevrolet van. [...] Ford sent the Urlichs a recall notice for the Pinto in 1979. A grand jury indicted Ford on three counts of reckless homicide. Indiana v. Ford was a landmark in product liability law as the first time a corporation faced criminal charges for a <b>defective</b> <b>product,</b> and the first time a corporation was charged with murder. [...] If convicted, Ford faced a maximum fine of $30,000 under Indiana's 1978 reckless homicide statute. [...] Ford's legal defense was vastly more ambitious than the effort mounted in the Grimshaw case. [...] The effort was led by James F. Neal with a staff of 80 and a budget of about $1 million; the Elkhart County state's attorney had a budget of about $20,000 and volunteer law professors and law students. A former head of the NHTSA, testifying on Ford's behalf, said the Pinto's design was no more or less safe than that of any other car in its class. In 1980 Ford was found not guilty. In 1980 a civil suit was settled for $7500 to each plaintiff.|$|E
2500|$|The Product Liability Directive 1985 was {{the first}} {{consumer}} protection measure. It creates strict enterprise liability for all producers and retailers for any harm to consumers from products, {{as a way to}} promote basic standards of health and safety. Any producer, or supplier if the ultimate producer is insolvent, of a product is strictly liable to compensate a consumer for any damage caused by a <b>defective</b> <b>product.</b> A [...] "defect" [...] is anything which falls below what a consumer is entitled to expect, and this essentially means that products should be safe for their purpose. A narrow defensive is available if a producer can show that a defect could not be known by any scientific method, thought this has never been successfully invoked, because it is generally thought a profit making enterprise should not be able to externalise the risks of its activities.|$|E

5000|$|Chysky {{is part of}} a {{progression}} of cases that influenced the products liability synthesis that emerged early in the century. The Chysky case reflects a refinement of Judge Cardozo's argument in MacPherson v Buick Motor Co. that a person could be liable for a <b>defective</b> <b>product</b> to someone other than the immediate purchaser. In Chysky, Cardozo joined Judge McLaughlin's opinion, which relied on Cardozo's statement in MacPherson that the basis of liability in that case was in tort, not contract. [...] "If the exceptions expressed in MacPherson had been a smokescreen for the basic principle that a producer of a <b>defective</b> <b>product</b> would be liable to anyone who might be expected to use it, Cardozo would have applied the MacPherson principles to permit the waitress to recover regardless of her choice not to sue in tort. Yet Cardozo joined the majority that ruled against the waitress, not Judge Hogan's silent dissent." ...|$|E
