Diploma Thesis, Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Pharmacy in Hradec Králové, Department of Pharmaceutical Botany and Ecology, Hradec Králové 2014, 49 pp. Obtained diethylether extract of <b>Fumaria</b> <b>officinalis</b> <b>L.</b> was separated to fractions in column chromatography with petrol, chloroform and ethanol. Preparative TLC and crystalisation led to isolation of five alkaloids from fraction.

Isolated alkaloids were tested for their inhibition activity towards acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase and towards prolyloligopeptidase. Activities were compared with standards. Natural inhibitor galanthamine showed IC 50 AChE 1. 710 ± 0. 065 µM, IC 50 BuChE 42. 30 ± 1. 30 µM. Best inhibition activity showed protopine (IC 50 AChE 345. 4 ± 24 µM, IC 50 BuChE 239. 6 ± 22. 3 µM) and cryptopine (IC 50 AChE 477. 71 ± 47. 33 µM, IC 50 BuChE 270. 82 ± 39. 12 µM). The highest prolyloligopeptidase inhibition activity showed (+) -parfumidine with IC 50 POP 99. 2 µM, which was more active than used natural inhibitor baicaline (IC 50 POP 605. 9 ± 0. 021 µM).

Apolar (lipid) fractions showed the presence of four free fatty acids, two esters of fatty acids with glycerol and two fatty alcohols. Sucrose and fructose were in the highest relative concentrations of identified carbohydrates. Citric acid was the dominant organic acid in polar fractions of five Fumaria species. Predominant compounds in lipid fractions were palmitic acid and 1 -stearoyl-glycerol. Principal component analysis (PCA) of GC-MS data of polar and apolar fractions of five Bulgarian Fumaria species differentiates them in two groups (F. officinalis and F. thuretii; F. rostellata and F. schrammii, respectively), while F. kralikii had phythochemical similarity with plants of both distinguished groups.

In this study two phytotherapeutic agents were investigated as monotherapy in tems of their therapeutic effects: Curcuma xanthorrhiza 3 x 20 mg Extract or <b>Fumaria</b> <b>officinalis</b> 3 x 500 mg Extract as a daily dosage. Material and Methods: After randomisation 106 IBS patients were treated in a doubleblind manner with Curcuma xanthorrhiza (n= 24), <b>Fumaria</b> <b>officinalis</b> (n= 24) or placebo (n= 58) over 18 weeks. The severity of the symptoms typical of IBS (pain, bloating etc.) were recorded by means of a score and standardised analog scales every 6 weeks. Results: Irrespective of the duration of treatment (6, 12 or 18 weeks), no significant difference was found in the assessment of quality of life or symptom severity between treatment with the phytotherapeutic agents and treatment with placebo. More than 50 % of the patients in every group reported improvement on their symptoms. Conclusio: The test substances had no specific therapeutic effect on patients with IBS.
