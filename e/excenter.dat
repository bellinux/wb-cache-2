50|$|In Euclidean geometry, an ex-tangential {{quadrilateral}} is a convex quadrilateral {{where the}} extensions {{of all four}} sides are tangent to a circle outside the quadrilateral. It has also been called an exscriptible quadrilateral. The circle is called its excircle, its radius the exradius and its center the <b>excenter</b> (E in the figure). The <b>excenter</b> lies {{at the intersection of}} six angle bisectors. These are the internal angle bisectors at two opposite vertex angles, the external angle bisectors (supplementary angle bisectors) at the other two vertex angles, and the external angle bisectors at the angles formed where the extensions of opposite sides intersect (see the figure to the right, where four of these six are dotted line segments). The ex-tangential quadrilateral is closely related to the tangential quadrilateral (where the four sides are tangent to a circle).|$|E

50|$|Note {{that the}} {{incenter}} of this common orthic triangle {{must be one}} of the original four orthocentric points. Furthermore, the three remaining points become the <b>excenters</b> of this common orthic triangle. The orthocentric point that becomes the incenter of the orthic triangle is that orthocentric point closest to the common nine-point center. This relationship between the orthic triangle and the original four orthocentric points leads directly {{to the fact that the}} incenter and <b>excenters</b> of a reference triangle form an orthocentric system.|$|R

50|$|This {{is readily}} {{seen to be}} a {{triangle}} center function and (provided the triangle is scalene) the corresponding triangle center is the <b>excenter</b> opposite to the largest vertex angle.

40|$|In this work, a novel {{design for}} small vibrotactors called the Dual <b>Excenter</b> is presented, {{which makes it}} {{possible}} to produce vibrations with independently adjustable frequency and amplitude. This feature has been realized using two coaxially aligned eccentric rotors, which are driven by DC motors independently. The prototype of the device has been built, where mechanical components are integrated on a frame with two optical sensors for the measurement of angular velocity and phase angle. The system is equipped with a digital controller. Simulations confirm the results of analytical investigations and they allow us to model the sampling method of the signals of the angular velocity and the phase angle between the rotors. Furthermore, we model the discrete behavior of the controller, which is a PI controller for the angular velocities and a PID controller for the phase angle. Finally, simulation results are compared to experimental ones, which show that the Dual <b>Excenter</b> concept is feasible...|$|E

40|$|Modal {{noise is}} a common source of noise {{introduced}} to the measurements by optical fibres and is particularly important for fibre-fed spectroscopic instruments, especially for high-resolution measurements. This noise source can limit the signal-to-noise ratio and jeopardize photon-noise limited data. The subject of the present work is to compare measurements of modal noise and focal-ratio degradation (FRD) for several commonly-used fibres. We study {{the influence of a}} simple mechanical scrambling method (<b>excenter)</b> on both FRD and modal noise. Measurements are performed with circular and octagonal fibres from Polymicro Technology (FBP-Series) with diameters of 100, 200 and 300 μm and for square and rectangular fibres from CeramOptec, among others. FRD measurements for the same sample of fibres are performed as a function of wavelength. Furthermore, we replaced the circular fibre of the STELLA-echelle-spectrograph (SES) in Tenerife with an octagonal and found a SNR increase by a factor of 1. 6 at 678 nm. It is shown in the laboratory that an <b>excenter</b> with a large amplitude and low frequency will not influence the FRD but will reduce modal noise rather effectively by up to 180...|$|E
40|$|This {{work is a}} {{study of}} a {{punching}} process using the ABAQUS/Explicit FE- code. A damage model based on equivalent plastic strain {{has been used to}} describe crack initiation and propagation in the blank. An axisymmetric model created in ABAQUS/CAE was used throughout the study. The model consists of a punch, blank holder, die and blank. In this work the punch, blank holder and die are modelled as rigid bodies while the blank is considered elastic-plastic. The materials used in simulations are DC 04, Docol 350 YP, Docol 800 DP and DC 1400 M. This selection of steel qualities has a wide span in mechanical properties and fields of application. Material characterisation for simulation purposes has been done by conducting uniaxial tensile tests. The data from these tests have been extrapolated beyond the necking strain by double Voce extrapolation. Punching experiments have been performed in an <b>excenter</b> driven press equipped with position and force measurement devices. The experiments result in load curves for the different steel qualities and gives information about the characteristic zones of the sheet edges. The results from simulations have been evaluated by comparisons with experiments concerning load curves, characteristic zones of the sheet edge, work done during the operation, maximum forces and stroke to failure. A good compliance with experiments was found concerning maximum forces, characteristic zones and work done during the operation. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} {{documented}} cubics that {{pass through a}} reference triangle and its orthocenter. The circumcubic known as the orthocubic - K006 is interesting in that it passes through three orthocentric systems {{as well as the}} three vertices of the orthic triangle (but not the orthocenter of the orthic triangle). The three orthocentric systems are the incenter and <b>excenters,</b> the reference triangle and its orthocenter and finally the orthocenter of the reference triangle together with the three other intersection points that this cubic has with the circumcircle of the reference triangle.|$|R

25|$|In 1996, Vaynshtejn was {{probably}} the first to prove another beautiful characterization of tangential quadrilaterals, that has later appeared in several magazines and websites. It states that when a convex quadrilateral is divided into four nonoverlapping triangles by its two diagonals, then the incenters of the four triangles are concyclic {{if and only if}} the quadrilateral is tangential. In fact, the incenters form an orthodiagonal cyclic quadrilateral. A related result is that the incircles can be exchanged for the excircles to the same triangles (tangent to the sides of the quadrilateral and the extensions of its diagonals). Thus a convex quadrilateral is tangential if and only if the <b>excenters</b> in these four excircles are the vertices of a cyclic quadrilateral.|$|R
40|$|Long {{and short}} term {{stability}} of the electron beam in the storage ring of the Swiss Light Source (SLS) is achieved by dynamic alignment systems and by fast closed orbit feedback. Quadrupoles, sextupoles and BPMs are rigidly mounted on girders, while the bending magnets are bridging adjacent girders. Positioning of the girders is performed by mover systems based on <b>excenters</b> and encoders. The girder positions are monitored by a hydrostatic leveling system and a digital encoder based horizontal positioning system. Another encoder based system for controlling the BPM positions relative to adjacent quadrupoles is calibrated by beam based alignment. Residual noise of the electron beam has been estimated by investigation of seismic spectra, girder eigen-frequencies, beam amplification factors and capabilities of the fast orbit feedback system. We will describe the systems, summarize the status by September 2001 and show first results. Technical and mathematical details of dynamic alignment are described in references [2] and [3].

5000|$|As the {{reflection}} of the orthocenter around the circumcenter, the de Longchamps point belongs to the line through both of these points, which is the Euler line of the given triangle. Thus, it is collinear with all the other triangle centers on the Euler line, which along with the orthocenter and circumcenter include the centroid and the center of the nine-point circle. The de Longchamp point is also collinear, along a different line, with the incenter and the Gergonne point of its triangle. The three circles centered at , , and , with radii , , and [...] respectively (where [...] is the semiperimeter) are mutually tangent, and there are two more circles tangent to all three of them, the inner and outer Soddy circles; the centers of these two circles also lie on the same line with the de Longchamp point and the incenter.

40|$|A {{retrospective}} {{analysis of the}} MR findings in 92 cases of acoustic neuromas is presented. The method of examination included in all cases intravenous injection of Gadolinium (Gd-DTPA or DOTA) with realization of sections in the axial and coronal planes. In 21 cases native MR studies were performed in the axial plane, before Gadolinium injection, with T 1 WI (n = 21), and T 2 WI (n = 6) images. Tumors were strictly intracanalar in 19 cases (20. 7 %), only localized in the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) in 5 cases (5. 4 %), and in 68 cases (73. 9 %) the tumors had intra- and extracanalar components. In this last group of lesions, 63. 2 % completely filled the internal auditory canal (IAC), and 36. 8 % occupied the internal portion of the IAC. In most cases (85. 3 %) the mean diameter of the CPA component was {{less than or equal}} to 2. 5 cm. Lesions were more frequently homogeneous (58. 8 %) after Gd i. v. -enhancement. Heterogeneity was noted mainly in large lesions (greater than 2. 5 cm: 100 %). In all cases but one, the tumors were round, or oval-shaped, well-delineated, and did not present significant contact with the petrous bone. In 80. 9 % of CPA lesions, the center of the tumor was posteriorly <b>excentered</b> in relation to the internal auditory canal, whereas it was centered in 16. 2 % of cases.
