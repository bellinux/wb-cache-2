5|$|Before 1914, Lenin's {{views were}} largely in {{accordance}} with mainstream European Marxist orthodoxy. Although he derided Marxists who adopted ideas from contemporary non-Marxist philosophers and sociologists, his own ideas were influenced not only by Russian Marxist theory but also by wider ideas from the Russian revolutionary movement, {{including those of the}} Narodnik agrarian-socialists. He adapted his ideas according to changing circumstances, including the pragmatic realities of governing Russia amid war, famine, and <b>economic</b> <b>collapse.</b> Thus, as Leninism developed, Lenin revised the established Marxist orthodoxy and introduced innovations in Marxist thought.|$|E

5|$|The Eleventh Five-Year Plan of the Soviet Union {{delivered}} a disappointing result: {{a change in}} growth from 5 to 4%. During the earlier Tenth Five-Year Plan, they had tried to meet the target of 6.1% growth, but failed. Brezhnev was able to defer <b>economic</b> <b>collapse</b> by trading with Western Europe and the Arab World. The Soviet Union still out-produced the United States in the heavy industry sector during the Brezhnev era. Another dramatic result of Brezhnev's rule was that certain Eastern Bloc countries became more economically advanced than the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria is in a {{state of}} {{demographic}} crisis. It has had negative population growth since the early 1990s, when the <b>economic</b> <b>collapse</b> caused a long-lasting emigration wave. Some 937,000 to 1,200,000 people—mostly young adults—left the country by 2005. The total fertility rate (TFR) was estimated in 2013 at 1.43 children born/woman, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1. A third of all households consist of only one person and 75.5 percent of families do not have children under the age of 16. Consequently, population growth and birth rates are among the lowest in the world while death rates are among the highest. The majority of children are born to unmarried women (of all births 57.4 percent were outside marriage in 2012).|$|E
5|$|Critics of {{the policy}} of {{economic}} liberalization pursued during the Menem Presidency argued that Argentina's economic woes were caused by neoliberalism, which had been actively promoted by the U.S. government and the IMF under the Washington Consensus. Others have stressed that the main shortcoming of economic policy-making during the 1990s was that economic reform was not pursued with enough determination. A 2004 report by the IMF's Independent Evaluation Office criticised the IMF's conduct prior to Argentina's <b>economic</b> <b>collapse</b> of 2001, saying the IMF had supported the country's fixed exchange rate for too long, and was too lenient towards fiscal deficits.|$|E

5|$|Fiscal chaos, {{coupled with}} {{problems}} {{of transportation and}} the requisition of metal led to a general <b>economic</b> <b>collapse</b> as factories ran out of raw materials and laid off workers. The crisis especially afflicted Belgium's large manufacturing industries. As raw material usually imported from abroad dried up, more firms laid off workers. Unemployment became a major problem and increased reliance on charity distributed by civil institutions and organisations. As many as 650,000 people were unemployed between 1915 and 1918. The German authorities used the crisis to loot industrial machinery from Belgian factories, which was either sent to Germany intact or melted down. The policy escalated {{after the end of}} the German policy of deportation in 1917 which later created major problems for Belgian economic recovery {{after the end of the}} war.|$|E

However, they must seek to attain this perfection during a period characterized by Prohibition and xenophobic anti-immigration legislation. Middlesex depicts the tribulations of attaining an identity, especially while dealing with the revelation that the American Dream is a delusion that has already disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1960s, the Iberian-type {{horse was}} called the Andalusian in both Portugal and Spain. In 1966, the Lusitano name was adopted by Portugal after a {{studbook}} separation by the two countries. The revolutions of Portugal's African colonies resulted in the near <b>economic</b> <b>collapse</b> of Portugal. The landed class attracted political agitators, estates were vacated, and stud farms were broken up and their horses sold to Spain. However, the best lines were saved {{through the efforts of}} breeders, and breeding soon increased. Today, Lusitanos are bred mainly in Portugal and Brazil, but maintain a presence in many other countries throughout the world, including Australia, the United States, Great Britain, South Africa, and other European countries. Crossbred horses of partial Lusitano blood are popular, especially when crossed with Andalusian, Arabian or Thoroughbred blood.|$|E

5|$|Sir Thomas Modyford {{had been}} {{appointed}} the Governor of Jamaica in February 1664 with instructions to limit {{the activities of the}} privateers; he made a proclamation against their activities on 11 June 1664, but economic practicalities led to him reversing the policy {{by the end of the}} month. About 1,500 privateers used Jamaica as a base for their activity and brought significant revenue to the island. As the planting community of 5,000 was still new and developing, the revenue from the privateers was needed to avoid <b>economic</b> <b>collapse.</b> A privateer was granted a letter of marque which gave him a licence to attack and seize vessels, normally of a specific country, or with conditions attached. A portion of all spoils obtained by the privateers was given to the sovereign or the issuing ambassador.|$|E

5|$|By 1809, the Napoleonic Wars {{were six}} years old and the British Royal Navy was {{dominant}} at sea. Blockaded in their home ports by British squadrons, French warships, merchant ships and transports were unable to sail and, as a result, the French colonies in the West Indies were largely cut off from France. These colonies were also closely blockaded themselves and, as a result, their ability to trade independently was severely curtailed, resulting in <b>economic</b> <b>collapse,</b> severe food shortages and social unrest. Messages warning of the deteriorating situation in the colonies had been sent {{during the summer of}} 1808, particularly from the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe. In response supplies had been sent from France in small convoys and individual frigates in the autumn. The British blockading ships had also intercepted the communications from the island, and relayed the information to the Admiralty in London, who had ordered Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane to assemble a force and invade the French colonies before reinforcements and supplies could reach them.|$|E
5|$|In Fort Myers, {{property}} damage was slight, limited mostly to scores of small boats and fishing smacks along the waterfront. The Cuban schooner Isabel Alvado sank offshore Boca Grande. The crew, who were immigrants, were rescued by the Coast Guard and later deported. In Martin County, a bridge connecting Stuart and Palm City was severely damaged and closed to traffic as a result. A temporary ferry service across the St. Lucie River was established and operated until repairs {{to the bridge}} were complete {{in the summer of}} 1929. One fatality was reported in Stuart. In the 1920s, there were plans to build a Hollywood-esque city featuring a movie studio called Picture City. These plans were canceled following the 1928 hurricane and subsequent <b>economic</b> <b>collapse.</b> In Fort Pierce, most of the impact was confined to the waterfront areas. A warehouse, fish houses, docks, and a bridge across the Indian River were destroyed, while several other buildings were unroofed. Damage in the city totaled about $150,000.|$|E
5|$|Roquebert's {{expedition}} to the Caribbean, was an unsuccessful operation by a French naval squadron to transport supplies to Guadeloupe in December 1809 {{at the height of}} the Napoleonic Wars. Over the previous year, British Royal Navy squadrons had isolated and defeated the French Caribbean colonies one by one, until by the autumn Guadeloupe was the only colony remaining in French hands. Cut off from the rest of the world by British blockade squadrons that intercepted all ships coming to or from the island, Guadeloupe was in a desperate situation, facing <b>economic</b> <b>collapse,</b> food shortages and social upheaval, as well as the impending threat of British invasion. In an effort to reinforce and resupply the colony, the French government sent four vessels to the West Indies in November 1809 under Commodore François Roquebert. Two of the ships were 20-gun flûtes carrying supplies and troops. The two others were 40-gun frigates, ordered to protect the storeships on their journey from the British forces operating off both the French and Guadeloupe coasts.|$|E

5|$|By {{virtue of}} geography, the Royal Navy {{was able to}} use her {{imposing}} battleship and battlecruiser fleet to impose a strict and successful naval blockade of Germany and kept Germany's smaller battleship fleet bottled up in the North Sea: only narrow channels led to the Atlantic Ocean and these were guarded by British forces. Both sides were aware that, because of the greater number of British dreadnoughts, a full fleet engagement would be likely to result in a British victory. The German strategy was therefore to try to provoke an engagement on their terms: either to induce a part of the Grand Fleet to enter battle alone, or to fight a pitched battle near the German coastline, where friendly minefields, torpedo-boats and submarines could be used to even the odds. Germany's submarines were able to break out and raid commerce, but even though they sank many merchant ships, they could not successfully blockade Great Britain – in contrast to Britain's successful battleship blockade of Germany, which was a major cause of Germany's <b>economic</b> <b>collapse</b> in 1918. The Royal Navy on the other hand, successfully adopted convoy tactics to combat Germany's submarine blockade and eventually defeated it.|$|E
5|$|The {{civil war}} {{had led to}} an <b>economic</b> <b>collapse</b> in the Transvaal, {{weakening}} the government's ability to back up its professed authority and sovereignty over the local chiefdoms, though Lydenburg and Utrecht did now accept the central administration. By 1865 tensions had risen with the Zulus {{to the east and}} war had broken out again between the Orange Free State and the Basotho. Pretorius and Kruger led a commando of about 1,000 men south to help the Free State. The Basotho were defeated and Moshoeshoe ceded some of his territory, but President Johannes Brand of the Free State decided not to give any of the conquered land to the Transvaal burghers. The Transvaal men were scandalised and returned home en masse, despite Kruger's attempts to maintain discipline. The following February, after a meeting of the executive council in Potchefstroom, Kruger capsized his cart during the journey home and broke his left leg. On one leg he righted the cart and continued the rest of the way. This injury incapacitated him for the next nine months, and his left leg was thereafter slightly shorter than his right.|$|E

40|$|A representative-consumer {{model with}} Epstein-Zin-Weil {{preferences}} and i. i. d. shocks, including rare disasters, accords with key asset-pricing observations. If {{the coefficient of}} relative risk aversion equals 3 - 4, the model accords with observed equity premia and risk-free real interest rates. If the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is greater than one, an increase in uncertainty lowers the price-dividend ratio for equity, whereas {{a rise in the}} expected growth rate raises this ratio. In a model with endogenous saving, more uncertainty lowers the saving ratio (because substitution effects dominate). The match with major features of asset pricing suggests that the model is a reasonable candidate for assessing the welfare cost of aggregate consumption uncertainty. In the baseline simulation, the welfare cost of disaster risk is large [...] society would be willing to lower real GDP by as much as 20 % each year to eliminate the small chance of major <b>economic</b> <b>collapses.</b> The welfare cost from usual economic fluctuations is much smaller, though still important, corresponding to lowering GDP by around 1. 5 % each year. ...|$|R
40|$|Individual “control frauds ” cause greater losses {{than all}} other forms of {{property}} crime combined. They are financial super-predators. Control frauds are crimes led {{by the head of}} state or CEO that use the nation or company as a fraud vehicle. Waves of “control fraud ” can cause <b>economic</b> <b>collapses,</b> damage and discredit key institutions vital to good political governance, and erode trust. The defining element of fraud is deceit – the criminal creates and then betrays trust. Fraud, therefore, is the strongest acid to eat away at trust. Endemic control fraud causes institutions and trust to become friable – to crumble – and produce economic stagnation. White-collar criminology emphasizes incentive structures. A criminogenic environment is one that has strong positive incentives to engage in crime. While economists stress incentive structures, economics ignores criminogenic environments. The weakness comes from three sources. Economic theory about fraud is underdeveloped, core neoclassical theories imply that major frauds are trivial, economists are not taught about fraud and fraud mechanisms, and neo-classical economists minimize the incidence an...|$|R
40|$|The {{essays in}} this volume {{document}} in various ways the limited extent of structural change in Africa over the past 40 years. They also document and analyse the failure of Africa to industrialise while addressing {{the question of how}} policies might be reshaped to boost industrial development and accelerate structural transformation in Africa. Each of the papers explores {{one or more of the}} channels by which industrial development drives structural change. They pointed out that the idea that Africa should industrialise is not new as the continent's post-independence leaders – like those in many developing countries in the 1960 s and 1970 s – looked to state-led, import substituting industrialisation as the key to rapid economic growth. However, the industries they created were frequently uncompetitive and unsustainable, and efforts to spur industrial development in Africa largely vanished with the <b>economic</b> <b>collapses</b> and adjustment programs of the 1980 s and 1990 s. In contrast to the region's earlier efforts at industrial policy, it was argued that states must work with the market as public action moves beyond the regulatory reform agenda to addressing the physical, institutional and knowledge constraints limiting Africa's industrial development.
