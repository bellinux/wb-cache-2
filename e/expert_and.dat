Thus, it can effectively deal with the bias of <b>experts,</b> <b>and</b> in turn is more appropriate for the assessment.|$|R

Dredd reasons that the detonator's signal will not reach the explosives from the ground floor, so he forces Ma-Ma to inhale Slo-Mo and throws her down the atrium to her death.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} the relative accuracy of a computerised method to quantitatively assess maximum urinary flow. METHODS: A total of 1147 uroflows {{were evaluated by}} the computerised method <b>and</b> by three <b>experts</b> from different European countries. The sample consisted of uroflows from the respective visits by a 20 % sample of randomly chosen patients (n = 223) with lower urinary tract symptoms with participation in two clinical trials in which the efficacy and safety of Permixon was evaluated. The proportions of automated maximum flow values included in the 10 % extended range of <b>experts</b> (<b>and</b> their 95 % confidence intervals) were assessed, {{as well as the}} concordance coefficients between <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> the computerised method and the paired Student's t-test for the average differences between <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> computer. RESULTS: The rate of agreement between <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> computer varied between about 95 and 100 % over factor levels for visit, type of machine and country. Concordance coefficients indicated good agreement between <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> the automated method. When looking at average differences between <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> the computer, the smallest differences were observed between <b>experts</b> 2, 3 <b>and</b> the computer (differences not statistically significant). Statistically significant average differences were observed between <b>expert</b> 1 <b>and</b> the other <b>experts</b> as well as between <b>expert</b> 1 <b>and</b> the computer. CONCLUSIONS: The computerised assessment decreases the fraction of variability of maximum urinary flow caused by artifacts as well as intra- and inter-expert variation. The computerised assessment of maximum urinary flow is an efficient, consistent and valid approach to quantitatively assess maximum urinary flow in clinical trial...|$|R

5|$|There was {{a strong}} belief that the race would be a battle between Carrera Jeans–Vagabond {{teammates}} Visentini and Roche. El Mundo Deportivo stated that Visentini had the edge in the time trial discipline and sprinting, while Roche had the advantage in climbing mountains. However, unlike Visentini, Roche came into the race in great shape after winning the Tour de Romandie and placing second in the Liège–Bastogne–Liège and the Critérium International. Cycling <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> author Bill McGann thought that the race would be disputed between Visentini and Gianbattista Baronchelli.|$|E

5|$|Wave Race 64 is {{a racing}} {{game in which}} players race on Jet Skis in {{different}} weather conditions and {{on a variety of}} courses. The game features three single-player modes (Championship, Time Trials, and Stunt Mode) as well as a multiplayer mode for competitive play. In the Championship mode, the player must race opponents through a series of courses and win the first place. Up to four levels of difficulty can be chosen: Normal, Hard, <b>Expert</b> <b>and</b> Reverse, the latter being Expert with the tracks oriented backwards. Hard, <b>Expert,</b> <b>and</b> Reverse must be unlocked by completing an earlier difficulty. The difficulty also determines the number of courses played: six in Normal, seven in Hard, and eight in Expert/Reverse. When the player completes a course, points are awarded based on the rank they finished. If the required quantity is not met, the player will be disqualified and the game will be over.|$|E

5|$|Around 1995, the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) {{called a}} bidding {{to sell the}} property. The tender went to a Malaysian firm, the Renong Berhad and ITT-Sheraton combine over Emilio Yap, a Chinese Filipino billionaire tycoon {{and owner of the}} Manila Bulletin, the country's largest {{newspaper}} by circulation. Yap went to the Supreme Court of the Philippines and won by matching Rehong's bid and citing the Constitution's Filipino First policy in the ownership of a 'national patrimony'. Fifty one percent of the ownership was awarded to Yap's Manila Prince Hotel Corporation (MPHC), while new owners joined on April 25, 1997 as 49 percent shareholder. Yap signed a check for ₱673.2 million and the MPHC took over the property on May 7, 1997. One of the first things Yap did was to pull down the three brass chandeliers in the lobby, upon recommendation of a feng shui <b>expert,</b> <b>and</b> replace them with five.|$|E

As a cavalryman educated in a Dresden military school under Count Maurice Bellegarde, a reformer of the Saxon army's cavalry, Dąbrowski was asked to help modernize the Polish cavalry, serving in the ranks of the 1st Greater Poland Cavalry Brygade (1 Wielkpolska Brygada Kawalerii Narodowej).

Additionally in the final episode of the show's second season Wood and co-host Adam Ferrara challenged Foust to a timed race at Infineon Raceway, otherwise known as Sears Point; Foust drove the Lexus LF-A around the real course while Wood and Ferrara drove the course in Forza Motorsport 4.|$|E
5|$|In the mid- to late 1970s Kujau, an able amateur artist, {{turned to}} {{producing}} paintings which he claimed were by Hitler, {{who had been}} an amateur artist as a young man. Having found a market for his forged works, Kujau created Hitler paintings depicting subjects his buyers expressed interest in, such as cartoons, nudes and men in action—all subjects that Hitler never painted, or would want to paint, according to Charles Hamilton, a handwriting <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> author of books on forgery. These paintings were often accompanied by small notes, purportedly from Hitler. The paintings were profitable for Kujau. To explain his access to the memorabilia he invented several sources in East Germany, including a former Nazi general, the bribable director of a museum and his own brother, who he re-invented as a general in the East German army.|$|E

Sarah leads Chuck up to the top floor of a skyscraper and attempts to call in an evacuation while Chuck explains what happened when he uploaded the Intersect. Sarah then aims her gun at Chuck when Casey arrives on the roof. Sarah warns Casey that Chuck uploaded the Intersect and tells Chuck that their mutual friend Bryce is dead. Chuck then flashes on the building where the visiting General Stanfield (Dale Dye) is giving an address and puts together all the pieces from the flashes he had been having: the stranger in the Large Mart is a demolitions <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> has set a bomb to destroy the conference. Chuck, Sarah, and Casey locate the bomb in the conference hall and Chuck defuses the bomb by deliberately infecting the machine with a computer virus.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton's second-in-command—although {{this was}} not {{clarified}} until the expedition reached the Antarctic—was Jameson Boyd Adams, a Royal Naval Reserve lieutenant who had turned down {{the chance of a}} regular commission to join Shackleton. He would also act as the expedition's meteorologist. Nimrods captain was another naval reserve officer, Rupert England; 23-year-old John King Davis, who would later make his own reputation as an Antarctic captain, was appointed chief officer at the last moment. Aeneas Mackintosh, a merchant navy officer from the P shipping line, was originally second officer, but was later transferred to the shore party, being replaced as second officer by A. E. Harbord. Others in the shore party were the two surgeons, Alistair Mackay and Eric Marshall, Bernard Day the motor <b>expert,</b> <b>and</b> Sir Philip Brocklehurst, the subscribing member who had been taken on as assistant geologist.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from boxing, a decision forced on {{him by his}} ailing knee, Dyer focused on his theatre appearances. His voice though, was not as it once was, and he strained to reach the higher notes of his range and bookings began to dry up. Dyer then refocussed on boxing, but this time as a manager. In the 1920s he moved to London, where he set himself up as a physical culture <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> ran a small stable of fighters. The three fighters training under him were Bristolians George Rose and Reggie Hobbs and most notably Bert Kirby from Birmingham. Kirby {{went on to become}} the British flyweight champion when he took the title from Jackie Brown in 1930. Dyer also ran a gym for gentleman on the Strand, which was used by fighters such as Bantamweight champion Teddy Baldock and American Packey McFarland who Dyer faced when the two men were boxing instructors in the US Army. The gym was later demolished to make way for a new hotel and Dyer was forced to find a new location.|$|E
