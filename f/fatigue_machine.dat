40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master thesis {{is to improve the}} current method of {{conducting}} fatigue bending tests of crankshafts at CTM. Currently they are using a servo hydraulic <b>fatigue</b> <b>machine,</b> however, they also have access to a resonance <b>fatigue</b> <b>machine.</b> The resonance <b>fatigue</b> <b>machine</b> can work at much higher frequencies and obtain result more rapidly at a lower cost. Thus, the main objective of this project has been to design and manufacture a tool for bending fatigue testing of crankshafts for CTM’s resonance <b>fatigue</b> <b>machine.</b> Secondary goal has been to design a method for preprocessing the crankshafts without affecting the results from the fatigue tests. All of this has been done according to the Volvo’s standard method for bending fatigue strength testing for crankshafts. At the start of the project a meticulous literature study including state of the art has been conducted for bending fatigue testing of crankshafts. From this, several concepts were generated, followed by both structural and modal analysis in order to ensure the function of the tool. From tests conducted in the resonance <b>fatigue</b> <b>machine</b> it could be concluded that the tool reached a resonance around 50 Hz. However, the maximum stress introduced in the sample was not enough to break the crankshaft. When increasing the load/stroke length in order to increase the stress, the power usage excided the capacity of the machine. When it was discovered that the desired result could not be achieved by the resonance <b>fatigue</b> <b>machine,</b> the tool was modified to fit the servo hydraulic <b>fatigue</b> <b>machine.</b> In order to see if the tool is able to work at a higher frequency than the current tool. It was possible to break the samples with a 50 % higher frequency and with a load ratio of - 1, which was not possible with the previous tool. This represents a 33 % cost reduction per test and the tests coincide better with the conditions of a crankshaft in an engine. Validerat; 20160530 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E

In order to perform fatigue tests in very high cycle regime of N= 10 ^ 9, a long period such as 230 days is required at the testing fiequency of 50 Hz.

40|$|The {{necessity}} of increased safety and reliability in mechanical components or structures became {{a subject of}} prime importance over the years. Therefore, to have a proper understanding of the damage and rupture mechanisms in materials subjected to fatigue at Very High Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) regimens is extremely important nowadays. However, using conventional <b>fatigue</b> testing <b>machines</b> to carry out VHCF tests can be very time-consuming and expensive; for instance, making a fatigue test at 30 Hz as working frequency {{would take more than}} one year to reach 109 cycles. Ultrasonic <b>fatigue</b> testing <b>machines</b> are being used to perform materials testing in the range of 108 to 1010 fatigue cycles. The so-called VHCF regimen is now under intense studies in which concerns the performance of ultrasonic <b>fatigue</b> testing <b>machines</b> themselves. Nevertheless, the accurate measurement of the parameters that influence fatigue life at ultrasonic frequencies (e. g., stress, displacement, strain-rate, temperature and frequency) is still a matter of concern and continuous development. Due to the high frequencies involved in VHCF testing, the heat generated on the specimens greatly affects the parameters that influence fatigue behavior. The objective {{of this paper is to}} describe the design, construction, instrumentation and operation of an ultrasonic <b>fatigue</b> testing <b>machine</b> of 20 kHz working frequency, with automatic strain and temperature control. In order to achieve fully automated tests, a closed loop control system was developed to use monitored temperature and displacement amplitude of the specimen to set the length of the powered and the cooling periods of the machine. The monitoring of the displacement, measured here at the bottom face of the specimen, is carried out using a high resolution laser. The specimen??s temperature is monitored online through a pyrometer and an infrared thermography camera. Data is acquired, managed and processed with a National Instruments DAQ device working at 400 kHz sampling frequency. The software was developed in-house using the LabView?? package. The present paper describes the advantages and drawbacks of metal fatigue testing at very high frequencies with special emphasis on the strain and temperature control issues. Comparison of tests carried out with and without both displacement and temperature control are made.
