50|$|LGL {{actively}} {{works in}} multiple fields affecting {{various aspects of}} LGBT* lives in Lithuania. The right to freedom of expression is being protected through the challenging application of the Lithuanian ‘homosexual propaganda’ law through various legal avenues, developing awareness raising campaigns and supplementing public discourse with LGBT*-related positive information. The right to freedom of peaceful assembly is being exercised through organizing large scale public awareness raising events, such as the annual Rainbow Days and the Baltic Pride festival (taking place once every three years). The community engagement is being ensured {{through the development of}} the volunteerism segment within the activities of the organization and through organizing various conferences, seminars, workshops and other cultural events for the local community members. The preventive strategies against homophobic and transphobic hate crimes are implemented through monitoring and documenting <b>hate</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>incidents,</b> training law enforcement officials and raising awareness among the community members encouraging to report witnessed or experienced hate crimes. Finally, advocacy on an international level is being implemented through submitting shadow reports to the international human rights protection mechanisms, issuing the organization’s newsletter (more than 6,000 international subscribers) and participating in the activities of the regional LGBT* networks.|$|R

The aim {{of this article is to}} compare disability-motivated hate crimes with other <b>hate</b> crimes <b>motivated</b> by homophobic or racist bias. This study employs a quantitative methodology utilising data collected by the ARCH hate crime recording system over a 10 -year period (2005 – 2015).

25|$|While {{this may}} be true, trying to {{separate}} Haq's actions from {{the larger context of}} the war on terrorism is tunnel vision at its worst.

40|$|The {{sentencing}} {{provisions of}} section 718. 2 (a) (i) of the Criminal Code of Canada adopt {{the view that}} Canadians {{have the right to}} live in society without being subjected to hatred. The research has shown, however, that section 718. 2 (a) (i) misses the opportunity to address hate-motivated offences directed toward Aboriginal people. This is particularly troubling given the high rates of violence experienced by Aboriginal people and Aboriginal women. It is now widely acknowledged that Euro-centric laws and discriminatory policies flourished in Canadian society in an attempt to dismantle formerly organized Aboriginal nations and their strong structures of governance, diverse cultures of language, practices and traditions. Although later laws were entrenched to transform oppressive relationships, this thesis reveals there remains significant gaps in understanding <b>hate</b> <b>motivated</b> crimes directed toward Aboriginal people and Aboriginal women. The patterns of violence directed toward Aboriginal women substantiate the finding that for some men, Aboriginal women are considered prey. However, the sparse data available does not distinguish Aboriginal women as a specific class of people subjected to hatred. Reviewing the current case law, the thesis looks closely at: proving <b>hate</b> <b>motivated</b> offences, ideology, slurs, knowledge, degree of motivation, identity of the victim, the accused and issues surrounding denial of culpability. Several important broad findings and trends of the courts are drawn from the examined jurisprudence and literature. This thesis revels there is little case law giving meaningful attention to the hatred of Aboriginal people. Aboriginal people are rarely found to be victims of hate-motivated crimes. Aboriginal people and Aboriginal women are, with few exceptions, a missing category of protection under section 718. (2) (a) (i) in both the written provisions and case law. The direct and specific inclusion of Aboriginal women as a protected category of protection under s. 718. 2 (a) (i) and a definition provision of hatred would be consistent with principles of the constitution, human rights law and the provisions of the Criminal Code. Most importantly, it may assist in addressing gaps in addressing hate-motivated crimes directed toward Aboriginal people and Aboriginal women...|$|R

5000|$|The early 1970s at Hillcrest saw {{a number}} of racially <b>motivated</b> <b>incidents</b> as the {{demographics}} of the school's attendance area began to shift. A late April 1970 incident, coupled with similar incidents in other local schools led to the spread of attacks beyond the school to the local community of Markham. [...] In 1971, the school was temporarily closed after a racially motivated fight that resulted in 48 students being suspended. [...] 1973 saw a 14 May riot that resulted in 34 suspensions and the recommendation for 20 expulsions. When the school board, under pressure from parents, decided to rescind some of the punishments without consulting the building staff or administration, the school's principal, Lee Cox, requested reassignment.|$|R
5000|$|One {{source of}} steady {{agitation}} {{has been the}} issue of Algerian emigration to France. French policies toward Algerian immigrants have been inconsistent, and French popular sentiment has generally been unfavorable toward its Arab population. The French government has vacillated between sweeping commitments to [...] "codevelopment," [...] involving extensive social networks for emigrant Algerian laborers, and support of strict regulations concerning work and study permits, random searches for legal papers, and expeditious deportation without appeal {{in the event of}} irregularities. North African communities in France remain relatively isolated, and chronic problems persist for Algerians trying to obtain housing, education, and employment. A number of racially <b>motivated</b> <b>incidents</b> occur each year between North African emigrants and French police and citizens.|$|R
50|$|On Friday night, April 16 around 11pm {{following}} the semifinal games, an ethnically <b>motivated</b> <b>incident</b> occurred when Crvena zvezda's director Igor Žeželj and B92 journalist Danijel Bukumirović got assaulted at {{the parking lot}} of Panorama Hotel by an organized group of fifteen Croatian hooligans with chains, rocks and metal poles. Bukumirović managed to escape into the car with only minor injuries while Žeželj wasn't as lucky and ended up with a fractured rib and 6 stitches on his forehead. Croatian police reportedly arrested six individuals in connection with the attack that was carried out by a group that trolled around the Final Four venue Dražen Petrović Basketball Hall, as well as hotels Sheraton and Panorama looking to beat up anyone from Serbia.|$|R
50|$|The season {{featured}} a huge political and ethnically <b>motivated</b> <b>incident</b> during the Hajduk Split vs. FK Partizan tie on Wednesday, 26 September 1990 at Poljud Stadium, when {{a mob of}} hardcore Hajduk fans invaded the pitch during second half {{in an attempt to}} lynch Partizan players. All of the Partizan players managed to run away into the dressing room, thus escaping unharmed. While chanting anti-Serb slogans, the violent mob then set fire to the Yugoslav flag that was displayed on the stadium's official mast. They then proceeded to raise the Croatian chequerboard flag (at the time not in official use and thus considered a Croatian nationalist symbol). At the moment of the incident, Partizan was leading 0-2 courtesy of the Milan Đurđević brace. The match was never resumed, and eventually registered 0-3 in Partizan's favour.|$|R
40|$|This article {{attempts}} {{to put forward}} a more holistic vision of hate crime causation by exploring the intersections which exist between three separate criminological theories. Within the extant literature both Robert Merton’s strain theory and Barbara Perry’s structured action theory of ‘doing difference’ {{have been widely used}} to explain why prejudice motivated crimes continue to pervade most communities. Together the theories help to illuminate the sociological factors which act to create immense fear of, and hatred towards, various minority identity groups. However, neither of these theories adequately explain why some individuals commit hate crimes while others, equally affected by socio-economic strains and social constructions of ‘difference’, do not. This article therefore moves beyond such macro explanations of hate crime by drawing upon Gottfredson and Hirschi’s A General Theory of Crime (1990). Using typology research carried out by various academics, the article {{attempts to}} illustrate how socio-economic strains and general fears of ‘difference’ become mutually reinforcing determinants, promulgating a culture of prejudice against certain ‘others', which in turn ultimately triggers the <b>hate</b> <b>motivated</b> behaviours of individuals with low self control...|$|R

500|$|Several racially <b>motivated</b> <b>incidents</b> {{occurred}} over the following days. According to the Time article, a group of whites entered an unsegregated Salisbury bar [...] "fingering the triggers of rifles" [...] and forced blacks drinking there to leave. Time also reported a rumour that two white youths, on learning of the massacre, shot the first black man they saw. Smith says that several would-be vigilante groups sought his permission to venture into the bush around the crash site to [...] "make the local people pay for their crime of harbouring and assisting the terrorists". He instructed them not to, according to his memoirs, telling them that many rural blacks only assisted the guerrillas under extreme duress, {{and that it would}} not do to attack them. Many Rhodesians also resented the apparent lack of sympathy emanating from overseas governments, especially considering the character of the attack and its civilian target.|$|R
50|$|It {{also led}} to a public inquiry, chaired by Sir William Macpherson of Cluny, whose report forced the police and other public bodies {{to change the way}} they deal with race issues, hate crimes and murders. But despite the undoubted {{improvements}} made in the investigation and handling of racist crime, the number of race-hate incidents reported to the police has continued to grow. Chief constables have argued that the rise in reported racist incidents is a positive development and reflects ethnic minorities' growing confidence in the police to deal with their complaints in a sympathetic and even-handed manner. Last year there were more than 59,000 racist incidents reported to the police, a rise of 12 per cent on the previous year. But the true scale of the problem is far higher. The British Crime Survey estimates that there are more than 200,000 racially <b>motivated</b> <b>incidents</b> every year.|$|R

50|$|Yingluck also {{proposed}} a general amnesty for all major politically <b>motivated</b> <b>incidents</b> {{that had taken}} place since the 2006 coup, which could include the coup itself, court rulings banning Thai Rak Thai and People's Power Party leaders from seeking office, the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) seizures of Government House and Don Muang and Suvarnabhumi Airports, the military crackdowns of 2009 and 2010, and the conviction of Thaksin Shinawatra for abuse of power. The proposal was fiercely attacked by the government, who claimed that it would specifically give amnesty to Thaksin, and also result in the return to him of the 46 billion baht of his wealth that the government had seized as a penalty. However, Yingluck denied that the return of seized assets was a priority for the Pheu Thai party, and repeated that she had no intention of giving amnesty to any one person. Abhisit claimed outright that Yingluck was lying and that amnesty to Thaksin actually was the Pheu Thai party's policy. The government blamed Pheu Thai for the bloodshed during the military crackdown.|$|R
50|$|The 1946 {{season was}} a {{successful}} one. The Nashua Dodgers placed second {{in the league and}} won the Governor's Cup, defeating the Lynn Red Sox. In terms of attendance, Nashua also proved successful, in part because of Bavasi's imaginative promotional skills. The league saw few racially <b>motivated</b> <b>incidents,</b> with two exceptions. Campanella has claimed that Manchester Giants catcher Sal Yvars threw dirt in his face during a game at Manchester Athletic Field (Gill Stadium), but the incident was resolved on the field (though Yvars has denied that the incident took place). More seriously, players and the manager of the Lynn Red Sox hurled racial slurs and insults at Campanella and Newcombe, particularly late in the season when the two clubs were locked in a tight pennant race. On one occasion, Bavasi was so enraged by the comments of the Red Sox that he met Lynn's manager and players in the Holman Stadium parking lot and challenged them to a fight. Players restrained Bavasi and the Lynn manager, and the Lynn team boarded their bus without further incident.|$|R

5000|$|Additionally, {{apart from}} the {{historical}} racial incidents including anti-Asian movements and anti-immigration legislation, Asian Americans are also victims of racism in the United States. According to the Annual Audit of Violence Against Asian Pacific Americans conducted by the NAPALC in 2003, Asian Americans {{are one of the}} targeted groups of “racially motivated harassment, vandalism, theft, physical assault, and in some cases, homicide”. Moreover, the discrimination in daily life are significantly injuring Asian Americans’ well-being, both physically and mentally. In the face of racially <b>motivated</b> <b>incidents,</b> students are reported to have “feelings of helplessness, depression, psychosomatic symptoms, and a loss of face”.  However, it is reported that Asian Americans’ own perception of racism against them is limited and the problem and needs caused by racism are often neglected by society, masked by stereotypes such as “model minority” and “honorary whites”.  It has been reported that self-esteem is positively related to people’s ethnic identity {{and the extent to which}} they explore their ethnic identity. Research conducted by Umaña-Taylor and Fine in 2002 shows that self-cognition from effective self-exploring and the attempt to build racial perception and ethnic identity is conductive to enhancing the self-esteem of minority population including Asian Americans.|$|R
