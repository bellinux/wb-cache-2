5|$|Before the {{evacuation}} of the St Kildian inhabitants, these sheep were farmed. However, when the St Kilda archipelago's human inhabitants were evacuated in 1930, the sheep of Hirta were also removed and in 1932 they were replaced by Soays, which still live there {{as well as on}} Soay itself. Meanwhile, the remaining sheep on Boreray were left to become feral; these became the only survivors of the crofters' sheep, {{and one of the few}} surviving descendants of the Dunface. This means that they are the original, unmodified sheep that used to be farmed on the island. In the 1970s half a <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were exported to form the basis of a breeding population on the mainland, but the majority of Borerays still remain on the island.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of volcanic plumes at Pele and Loki in 1979 provided conclusive evidence that Io was geologically active. Generally, plumes form when volatiles like sulfur and sulfur dioxide are ejected skyward from Io's volcanoes at speeds reaching , creating umbrella-shaped clouds {{of gas and}} dust. Additional materials that might {{be found in the}} volcanic plumes include sodium, potassium, and chlorine. Although striking in appearance, volcanic plumes are relatively uncommon. Of the 150 or so active volcanoes observed on Io, plumes have only been observed at a couple of <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> The limited area of Io's lava flows suggests that much of the resurfacing needed to erase Io's cratering record must come from plume deposits.|$|E
25|$|The Aérospatiale SA 360 Dauphin was a {{single-engine}} French {{utility helicopter}} {{developed as a}} replacement for Aérospatiale's Alouette III in the early 1970s and to fill a gap in the company's product line in the six to ten-seat helicopter category. However, as the new helicopter offered little advantage over its predecessor and thus limited market appeal, production of the SA 360 Dauphin was abandoned after only a few <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> had been built.|$|E

Brocius and several other men resented the interruption, and about a <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> including Brocius, shot and killed Lloyd. Owner O'Neil took the blame and was acquitted.|$|E
25|$|On 6 August 2008, {{the heavy}} ground {{fighting}} {{erupted in the}} Loisam area of the Bajaur district. The Loisam lies on the strategically important road leading towards the main northwestern city of Peshawar. The fighting started when hundreds of foreign fighters poured into the area and began attacking armed forces. After four days of fighting on 10 August 2008, the military was forced {{to withdraw from the}} area. It resulted in confirmed killing of 100 militants and 9 soldiers, and another 55soldiers were missing, at least three <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> captured by the militants. While the fighting was going on in Bajaur, in the Buner area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, the militants killed at least nine policemen in an attack on a check post. The checkpoint was then abandoned, and the army troops withdrew to Khar, the main town of Bajaur Agency. There were reports that the town of Khar was then besieged by tribal militants.|$|E
25|$|On 12 October, PA {{police arrested}} two Israeli reservists who had accidentally entered Ramallah, {{where in the}} {{preceding}} weeks a hundred Palestinians had been killed, nearly two <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> minors. Rumours quickly spread that Israeli undercover agents were in the building, and an angry crowd of more than 1,000 Palestinian mourners gathered {{in front of the}} station calling for their death. Both soldiers were beaten, stabbed, and disembowelled, and one body was set on fire. An Italian television crew captured the killings on video and then broadcast his tape internationally. A British journalist had his camera destroyed by rioters as he attempted to take a picture. The brutality of the killings shocked the Israeli public, who saw it as proof of a deep-seated Palestinian hatred of Israel and Jews. In response, Israel launched a series of retaliatory air-strikes against Palestinian Authority targets in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The police station where the lynching had taken place was evacuated and destroyed in these operations. Israel later tracked down and arrested those responsible for killing the soldiers.|$|E

500|$|The bill, as amended, {{passed the}} Senate without {{recorded}} vote on March 27, 1936. [...] The House of Representatives received the bill on April 1, and referred {{it to the}} Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. It was reported back to the House on April 16, having been amended to require the Cleveland committee to purchase not less than 25,000 coins at one time, eliminating {{the possibility that the}} committee could order an initial 5,000 and then fail to purchase any more. The full House considered the bill on April 23, 1936, with the bill reported by John Joseph Cochran of Missouri as an emergency measure. When he asked for unanimous consent to pass the amended bill, Pennsylvania's Robert F. Rich asked how many coinage bills were going to be considered and if it would not be possible to consolidate a <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> into one bill. [...] Cochran replied that he had consulted with Ohio's Robert Crosser and been informed that [...] "if we do not get the authority to print the coins now it will be useless". The following day, Bulkley moved that the Senate concur in the House amendments, which it did, and the bill was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on May 5, 1936.|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, DNA tests {{conducted}} upon remains {{identified in}} 1980 through dental analysis {{as those of}} Michael Marino revealed that the remains had been misidentified. Marino's mother had always doubted the identification of her son because clothing found upon the body was inconsistent with what her son had worn when she last saw him. In addition, the dental X-ray conducted upon the victim identified as Michael Marino had revealed the victim had all of his second molars, whereas a dental X-ray conducted upon Marino in March 1976 revealed one molar had not erupted. Nonetheless, the orthodontist who had identified Marino's remains has stated his conviction in the accuracy of his findings, adding he had [...] "compared 32 teeth, probably half a <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> had very distinct fillings {{and every one of}} them was consistent with Michael Marino." ...|$|E
2500|$|No melody is employed, {{as in the}} Western carillon, {{but rather}} a {{complicated}} polyrhythmical sequence of sounds is produced. [...] "The foundation of Orthodox bell ringing lies not in melody but in rhythm, with its intrinsic dynamic, and in {{the interaction of the}} timbres of [...] bells." [...] These sequences have a very special harmony, since Russian bells (unlike Western European ones) are not tuned to a single note. [...] Western bells usually have an octave between the loudest upper tone ("ring") and the loudest lower tone ("hum"). Russian bells have a seventh between these sounds. Generally, a good Russian bell is tuned to produce a whole scale of sounds (up to several <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> <b>them).</b> This effect is accomplished both by the composition of the alloy from which the bell is cast and the sculpting of the sides of the bell in the mold.|$|E

2500|$|Reaching a Palestinian Authority roadblock, where {{previously}} Israeli {{soldiers had}} been turned back, the reservists were detained by PA policemen and taken to the local police station at Ramallah's twin city el-Bireh, not far from Arafat's headquarters. [...] The arrest and detention coincided with {{the conclusion of a}} funeral service, attended by thousands of mourners, for Halil Zahran (17), a Palestinian youth who might have been killed by Israeli forces two days earlier. Tensions were running high: over 100 Palestinians, nearly two <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> minors, had been killed in the preceding two weeks in violent protests with Israelis forces in Ramallah, and four days earlier, the badly beaten body of Issam Hamad (36) had been dumped outside of the city after being run over by a car, an autopsy revealed.
