40|$|For the {{application}} of the notch stress approach, local stresses at the notch root have to be calculated. This demands a fine discretization of the finite element model in the notch leading for complex structures to large finite element models which are difficult to handle and take a high amount of calculation time. This paper contains the detailed investigation of the required finite element mesh in the notch area for application of the notch stress approach. Based on small-scale specimens, various meshing rules are applied and compared to each other. As the most important factor for the efficiency of a finite element mesh, the element shape in the notch root was identified. It should be chosen according to the stress gradients: The higher the stress gradients are, the smaller the element edge length should be modeled. The shape of the subsequent elements inside the volume has no major influence on the accuracy of the calculation. Recommendations for practical use are given for various element types, <b>including</b> commonly used <b>tetrahedron</b> <b>and</b> hexahedron element with linear and quadratic shape function. Expected numerical errors for the chosen mesh configuration are indicated...|$|R

This data {{was compared to}} the EXAFS spectra of CdSe and CdO standards. Cd local structure models were constructed and used for the least square analysis of the spectra. The first model employed implantation of a cadmium atom and a single oxygen atom into the CIGS lattice. Specifically, an oxygen atom {{was introduced in the}} tetrahedral bonded Cd-Se local structure. Employing FEFF 8 with WinXAS software package, experimental data was theoretically fitted to the first shell single-scattering paths of the Cd atom in the (PE) treated Cu(In[subscript 0. 7]Ga[subscript 0. 3]) Se₂ thin film samples. The main peak observed in the data represents the Cd-Se bonds and the shoulder corresponds to the Cd-O bond. However, the number of total nearest neighbors is not consistent with this model. A two-phase model that <b>includes</b> both Cd-Se <b>tetrahedron</b> <b>and</b> Cd-O octahedron were then reconstructed. Again, a least-agrees very well with the experimental data, and the total first nearest neighbor number is consistent with the two phase model at NN= 4. 2. This study indicates the surface of Cd partial electrolyte treated Cu(In[subscript 0. 7]Ga[subscript 0. 3]) Se₂ thin films contains both CdSe and CdO...|$|R
