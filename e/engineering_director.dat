25|$|At its debut, Chrome OS {{was viewed}} as a {{competitor}} to Microsoft, both directly to Microsoft Windows and indirectly the company's word processing and spreadsheet applications—the latter through Chrome OS's reliance on cloud computing. But Chrome OS <b>engineering</b> <b>director</b> Matthew Papakipos argued that the two operating systems would not fully overlap in functionality because Chrome OS is intended for netbooks, which lack the computational power to run a resource-intensive program like Adobe Photoshop.|$|E
25|$|The Caparo T1 is a British mid-engine, rear-wheel drive, two-seat {{automobile}} {{built by}} Caparo Vehicle Technologies, founded by design director Ben Scott-Geddes, <b>engineering</b> <b>director</b> Graham Halstead, engineers formerly {{involved in the}} development of the McLaren F1 and Sean Butcher, marketing director and financier. The T1 was inspired by Formula One design, and intended as a relatively affordable road legal racing car. The T1 was scheduled for production in mid-2007 for a price of GB£235,000 with approximately 25 cars per year built but , 16 examples have been sold in the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Google {{announced}} Chrome OS on July 7, 2009, {{describing it}} as an operating system in which both applications and user data reside in the cloud. To ascertain marketing requirements, the company relied on informal metrics, including monitoring the usage patterns of some 200 Chrome OS machines used by Google employees. Developers also noted their own usage patterns. Matthew Papakipos, former <b>engineering</b> <b>director</b> for the Chrome OS project, put three machines in his house and found himself logging in for brief sessions: to make a single search query or send a short email.|$|E

25|$|In 2016, Google {{introduced}} {{the ability to}} run Android apps on supported Chrome OS devices, {{with access to the}} entire Google Play Store. The previous Native Client-based solution was dropped in favor of a container containing Android's frameworks and dependencies (initially based on Android 6.0), which allows Android apps to have direct access to the Chrome OS platform, and allow the OS to interact with Android contracts such as sharing. <b>Engineering</b> <b>director</b> Zelidrag Hornung explained that ARC had been scrapped due to its limitations, including its incompatibility with the Android Native Development Toolkit (NDK), and that it was unable to pass Google's own compatibility test suite.|$|E
25|$|David Uckotter, {{who was the}} <b>engineering</b> <b>director</b> for the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government {{during the}} road's construction, also noted that Man o' War had to be {{designed}} and built around numerous subdivisions that were sprouting throughout south Lexington in that era. He indicated that this dictated a 120-foot right-of-way, which left no room for breakdown lanes. Uckotter also added {{that at the time}} Man o' War was proposed, plans were on the table for a southern beltway similar to New Circle Road outside Man o' War, hugging the border between Lexington and Jessamine County. These plans were dropped in the early 1980s, leaving Man o' War as Lexington's only circumferential road outside New Circle, which Uckotter contends has contributed to current problems with Man o' War.|$|E
500|$|Controversy also {{surrounded}} the new Ligier JS41 car, with rival team owners {{comparing it to}} the Benetton B195 car because of their similar design, the only apparent difference being the engine in each car.

500|$|Although Piquet's {{result was}} fortuitous, Renault <b>Engineering</b> <b>Director,</b> Pat Symonds, {{subsequently}} praised him for {{stepping up to}} the job of staying with the leaders in the final stint of the race. Meanwhile, Massa commented that his car was not in good order during the race: [...] "It was just slow with difficult stability and also on braking I think I had a little problem as well and lost a lot of performance. I didn’t have the car to fight. I tried but it was not possible." [...] Teammate Räikkönen also struggled with low grip and hot brakes {{for the duration of the}} race, while Kovalainen and Kubica had problems with their tyres.|$|E
500|$|The {{first three}} members of the Goito class was {{designed}} by Engineering General Inspector Benedetto Brin, while [...] was designed by <b>Engineering</b> <b>Director</b> Giacinto Pullino. Brin had previously designed several classes of very large ironclad battleships, including the [...] and es, but by the 1880s, he had begun to embrace the ideas of the Jeune École, which emphasized small, fast, torpedo-armed vessels that could damage or destroy the much larger battleships {{at a fraction of the}} cost. The four Goitos were similar to the preceding cruiser , the first torpedo cruiser Brin designed. As these were among the initial designs prepared by the Italian navy, they were experimental; Brin and Pullino used different hull shapes for all four vessels and fitted them with a variety of propulsion systems and armament.|$|E
500|$|Rain {{threatened}} {{during the}} second part. Although it did not materialise, all the drivers posted quick laps early on {{to avoid having to}} set a time on a wet track. Alonso was again fastest with a 1:34.057. Hamilton, both Ferraris, BMW Saubers, and Toyotas, as well as Rosberg (Williams) and Webber (Red Bull) also passed through to the final part. Kovalainen (Renault), Fisichella (Renault), Coulthard (Red Bull), Sato (Super Aguri), Button (Honda) and Liuzzi (STR) were eliminated. 2006 champions Renault failed to get either car into the final part. Team <b>engineering</b> <b>director</b> Pat Symonds noted that [...] "...the overall level of performance is disappointing, but we now have to knuckle down and {{make the most of the}} situation we find ourselves in." [...] Button claimed Honda's grid position of 15th was the [...] "maximum we could possibly get".|$|E

2500|$|Alonso {{turned the}} tables on Hamilton in the second {{practice}} session, with Alonso three tenths ahead {{of the rest of}} the field, but Hamilton was back in fifth. McLaren team boss Ron Dennis said that they had made the [...] "best possible start to the weekend". The Renaults of Giancarlo Fisichella and Heikki Kovalainen produced a late surge to finish 2nd and 3rd, ahead of both Ferraris, who were down in 4th and 6th. However, Renault's <b>engineering</b> <b>director</b> Pat Symonds played down the times, saying they were [...] "done with a lower fuel load" [...] and [...] "are therefore unrepresentatively high in the timesheets". Behind the top three teams, Nico Rosberg was again in the top ten in his Williams, with <b>engineering</b> <b>director</b> Patrick Head saying they've been [...] "playing catch up today", after a high-speed crash by Rosberg during the Barcelona test. Although out of the top six, Nick Heidfeld said his eighth place [...] "doesn't reflect how competitive we are", with Webber and Scott Speed rounding out the top ten.|$|E

2500|$|Chrome OS is {{initially}} intended for secondary devices like netbooks, {{not as a}} user's primary PC, and will run on hardware incorporating an x86 or ARM-based processor. While Chrome OS will support hard disk drives, Google has requested that its hardware partners use solid-state drives [...] "for performance and reliability reasons" [...] {{as well as the}} lower capacity requirements inherent in an operating system that accesses applications and most user data on remote servers. In November 2009 Matthew Papakipos, <b>engineering</b> <b>director</b> for the Chrome OS claimed that the Chrome OS consumes one-sixtieth as much drive space as Windows 7.|$|E

2500|$|The second tank saw {{astronaut}} {{training in}} pressure suits {{beginning with the}} Navy Mark IV. [...] The MSFC Manufacturing Engineering (ME) lab developed a constant pressure valve which [...] "made it possible to maintain neutral buoyancy at any depth." [...] Divers first tried the Mark IV in the tank in July 1966, and Alan Bean spent two hours [...] "executing typical astronaut activities" [...] in the tank on September 6, 1966. [...] Bean was [...] "quite enthusiastic and outspoken about neutral buoyancy {{as one of the}} mandatory methods of simulation for all the S-IVB Workshop experiments," [...] according to Manufacturing <b>Engineering</b> <b>director</b> W.
