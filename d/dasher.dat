25|$|Napoleon {{acted to}} counter Britain's {{maritime}} supremacy and economic power, closing European ports to British trade.

The Royal Navy reacted by commissioning small warships of traditional Bermuda design. The first three ordered from Bermudian buildersâ€”HMS <b>Dasher,</b> HMS Driver and HMS Hunterâ€”were sloops of 200 tons, armed with twelve 24-pounder guns. A great many more ships of this type were ordered, or bought from trade, primarily for use as couriers.
