40|$|The iron & <b>steel</b> <b>industry</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{energy-intensive}} sectors in China. In this paper, we define the variable of energy intensity to analyze the energy conservation potential in China's iron & steel sector using the co-integration method and scenario analysis. We find that there is a long-term relationship between energy intensity and factors such as R&D intensity, labor productivity, enterprise scale, and energy price. Monte Carlo simulation technique is further used to address uncertainty problem. The results show that under baseline scenario, the energy intensity of China's iron & steel sector will reach 17. 09 tons of coal equivalents per 10, 000 Yuan (Tce/ 10, 000 Yuan) in 2020. The energy saving potential in 2020 will be 344. 05 Mtce (million tons of coal equivalents) and 579. 43 Mtce under moderate energy-saving scenario and advanced energy-saving scenario respectively. Finally, based on the results of the elasticity coefficients of the long-term equation, we propose future policy for promoting energy conservation in China's iron & <b>steel</b> <b>industry.</b> ? 2014 Elsevier <b>Ltd...</b>|$|R

40|$|The study {{evaluates the}} energy saving {{potential}} of the Chinese <b>steel</b> <b>industry</b> by studying its potential future energy efficiency gap. In order {{to predict the future}} energy efficiency gap, a multivariate regression model combined with risk analysis is developed to estimate future energy intensity of China's <b>steel</b> <b>industry.</b> It is found that R&D intensity, energy saving investment, labor productivity and industry concentration are all important variables that affect energy intensity. We assess the possible measures as to how China's <b>steel</b> <b>industry</b> can narrow the energy efficiency gap with Japan by means of scenario analysis. Using Japan's current energy efficiency level as baseline, the {{energy saving potential}} of China's <b>steel</b> <b>industry</b> is more than 200 million ton coal equivalent in 2008, and it would fall to zero in 2020. However, if greater efforts were made to conserve energy, {{it would be possible to}} narrow down the energy efficiency gap between China and Japan by around 2015. Finally, using the results of the scenario analysis, future policy priorities for energy conservation in China's <b>steel</b> <b>industry</b> are assessed in this paper.
