5|$|It {{was quickly}} {{realized}} that a glass <b>dispersive</b> prism was not suitable {{for use in the}} ultraviolet spectrum. Glass absorbed electromagnetic radiation below 400 millimicrons rather than dispersing it. In the Model B, a quartz prism was substituted for the earlier glass.|$|E
5|$|Altitudinal {{migration}} {{is a form}} of short distance migration in which birds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes and move to lower ones during suboptimal conditions. It is most often triggered by temperature changes and usually occurs when the normal territories also become inhospitable due to lack of food. Some species may also be nomadic, holding no fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability. Parrots as a family are overwhelmingly neither migratory nor sedentary but considered to either be <b>dispersive,</b> irruptive, nomadic or undertake small and irregular migrations.|$|E
5|$|A Faraday filter, {{magneto-optical}} filter, FADOF or EFADOF (Excited Faraday <b>Dispersive</b> Optical Filter) {{works by}} rotating the polarization {{of the light}} passing through the vapor cell. This rotation occurs near its atomic absorption lines by the Faraday effect and anomalous dispersion. Only light at the resonant frequency of the vapor is rotated and the polarized plates block other electromagnetic radiation. This effect is related to and enhanced by the Zeeman Effect, or the splitting of atomic absorption lines {{in the presence of}} the magnetic field. Light at the resonant frequency of the vapor exits a FADOF near its original strength but with an orthogonal polarization.|$|E
5|$|During the summer, {{the black}} stork is found from Eastern Asia (Siberia and {{northern}} China) west to Central Europe, reaching Estonia in the north, Poland, Lower Saxony and Bavaria in Germany, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy and Greece in the south, with an outlying {{population in the}} central-southwest region of the Iberian Peninsula (Extremadura and surrounding provinces of Spain, plus Portugal). It is migratory, wintering in tropical Africa and Asia, although certain populations of black storks are sedentary or <b>dispersive.</b> An isolated population exists in Southern Africa, where the species is more numerous in the east, in eastern South Africa and Mozambique, and {{is also found in}} Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Botswana and less commonly Namibia.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of woodpeckers are sedentary {{but there are}} a few examples of migratory species such as the rufous-bellied woodpecker and yellow-bellied sapsucker, and the Eurasian wryneck breeds in Europe and west Asia and migrates to the Sahel in Africa in the winter. More northerly populations of Lewis's woodpecker, northern flicker, Williamson's sapsucker, red-breasted sapsucker and red-naped sapsucker all move southwards in the fall in North America. Most woodpecker movements can be described as <b>dispersive,</b> such as when young birds seek territories after fledging, or eruptive, to escape harsh weather conditions. Several species are altitudinal migrants, for example the grey-capped woodpecker, which moves to lowlands from hills during the winter months. The woodpeckers that do migrate do so during the day.|$|E
5|$|The {{massive and}} rapid {{expansion}} of the cattle egret's range is due to its relationship with humans and their domesticated animals. Originally adapted to a commensal relationship with large grazing and browsing animals, it was easily able to switch to domesticated cattle and horses. As the keeping of livestock spread throughout the world, the cattle egret was able to occupy otherwise empty niches. Many populations of cattle egrets are highly migratory and <b>dispersive,</b> and this has helped the species' range expansion. The species {{has been seen as}} a vagrant in various sub-Antarctic islands, including South Georgia, Marion Island, the South Sandwich Islands and the South Orkney Islands. A small flock of eight birds was also seen in Fiji in 2008.|$|E
25|$|X-ray {{detectors}} vary {{in shape}} and function depending on their purpose. Imaging detectors such as those used for radiography were originally based on photographic plates and later photographic film, but are now mostly replaced by various digital detector types such as image plates and flat panel detectors. For radiation protection direct exposure hazard is often evaluated using ionization chambers, while dosimeters are {{used to measure the}} radiation dose a person has been exposed to. X-ray spectra can be measured either by energy <b>dispersive</b> or wavelength <b>dispersive</b> spectrometers.|$|E
25|$|Another bipolar {{instrument}} is characterized with both electrodes {{on the same}} design, but the <b>dispersive</b> electrode is {{much larger than the}} active one. Since current density is higher in front of the smaller electrode, the heating and associated tissue effects take place only (or primarily) in front of the active electrode, and exact position of the <b>dispersive</b> electrode on tissue is not critical. Sometimes such configuration is called sesquipolar, even though the origin of this term in Latin (sesqui) means a ratio of 1.5.|$|E

25|$|Isaac Newton {{discovered}} that white light, after being split into its component colours when {{passed through a}} <b>dispersive</b> prism, could, by passing them through a different prism, be recombined to make white light.|$|E
25|$|In energy <b>dispersive</b> spectrometers (EDX or EDS), the {{detector}} allows {{the determination of}} the energy of the photon when it is detected. Detectors historically have been based on silicon semiconductors, in the form of lithium-drifted silicon crystals, or high-purity silicon wafers.|$|E
25|$|The cnoidal wave {{solutions}} {{were derived}} by Korteweg and de Vries, in their 1895 paper {{in which they}} also propose their <b>dispersive</b> long-wave equation, {{now known as the}} Korteweg–de Vries equation. In the limit of infinite wavelength, the cnoidal wave becomes a solitary wave.|$|E
25|$|If D is {{less than}} zero, the medium {{is said to have}} {{positive}} dispersion or normal dispersion. If D is greater than zero, the medium has negative dispersion. If a light pulse is propagated through a normally <b>dispersive</b> medium, the result is the higher frequency components slow down more than the lower frequency components. The pulse therefore becomes positively chirped, or up-chirped, increasing in frequency with time. This causes the spectrum coming out of a prism to appear with red light the least refracted and blue/violet light the most refracted. Conversely, if a pulse travels through an anomalously (negatively) <b>dispersive</b> medium, high frequency components travel faster than the lower ones, and the pulse becomes negatively chirped, or down-chirped, decreasing in frequency with time.|$|E
25|$|The angular {{wavenumber}} k {{and frequency}} ω are not independent parameters (and thus also wavelength λ and period T are not independent), but are coupled. Surface gravity waves on a fluid are <b>dispersive</b> waves – exhibiting frequency dispersion – meaning that each wavenumber {{has its own}} frequency and phase speed.|$|E
25|$|Characteristic X-rays {{that are}} {{produced}} by the interaction of electrons with the sample may also be detected in an SEM equipped for energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy or wavelength <b>dispersive</b> X-ray spectroscopy. Analysis of the x-ray signals {{may be used to}} map the distribution and estimate the abundance of elements in the sample.|$|E
25|$|Dumping both {{depends upon}} {{ecosystem}} resilience whilst threatening it. Dumping of sewage and other contaminants {{into the ocean}} is often undertaken for the <b>dispersive</b> nature of the oceans and adaptive nature and ability for marine life to process the marine debris and contaminants. However, waste dumping threatens marine ecosystems by poisoning marine life and eutrophication.|$|E
25|$|In a <b>dispersive</b> medium, {{the speed}} of sound is a {{function}} of sound frequency, through the dispersion relation. Each frequency component propagates at its own speed, called the phase velocity, while the energy of the disturbance propagates at the group velocity. The same phenomenon occurs with light waves; see optical dispersion for a description.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to use prisms rather than gratings as a <b>dispersive</b> elements, as in Figure 3. Despite such a simple change the set-up behaves quite differently, as to first order no group delay dispersion is introduced. Such a stretcher/compressor can have both a positive or negative dispersion, depending on the geometry and the material properties of the prisms. With lenses, {{the sign of the}} dispersion can be reversed, similar to Figure 2. For a given distance between the <b>dispersive</b> elements, prisms generate much less dispersion than gratings. Prisms and gratings are sometimes combined to correct higher order dispersion ("grisms"), in which case the distance between the prisms is on the order of 10 meters rather than 50cm as with a grating compressor. Gratings lose power into the other orders while prisms lose power due to Rayleigh scattering.|$|E
25|$|For {{single-wall}} carbon nanotubes, ISO/TS 10868 {{describes a}} measurement method for the diameter, purity, and fraction of metallic nanotubes through optical absorption spectroscopy, while ISO/TS 10797 and ISO/TS 10798 establish methods {{to characterize the}} morphology and elemental composition of single-wall carbon nanotubes, using transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy respectively, coupled with energy <b>dispersive</b> X-ray spectrometry analysis.|$|E
25|$|Lead crystal {{glassware}} {{was formerly}} used to store and serve drinks, {{but due to}} the potential health risks of lead, this has become rare. One alternative material is crystal glass, in which barium oxide, zinc oxide, or potassium oxide are employed instead of lead oxide. Lead-free crystal has a similar refractive index to lead crystal, but it is lighter and it has less <b>dispersive</b> power.|$|E
25|$|Fossils of the extinct Pleistocene stork Ciconia maltha {{discovered}} in North America appear morphologically intermediate between the maguari stork and white stork and may therefore represent a common ancestral link {{between these two}} species that inhabit different continents. Ciconia maltha was probably highly <b>dispersive</b> and could have extended its range to Venezuela from North America during the Pliocene, part {{of the range of}} the extant maguari stork.|$|E
25|$|Attractive {{fields for}} current and {{potential}} utilization of polyaniline is in antistatics, charge dissipation or electrostatic <b>dispersive</b> (ESD) coatings and blends, electromagnetic interference shielding (EMI), anticorrosive coatings, hole injection layers, transparent conductors, {{indium tin oxide}} replacements, actuators, chemical vapor and solution based sensors, electrochromic coatings (for color change windows, mirrors etc.), PEDOT-PSS replacements, toxic metal recovery, catalysis, fuel cells and active electronic components such as for non-volatile memory.|$|E
25|$|In optics, a {{diffraction}} grating is an optical component with a periodic structure, which splits and diffracts light into several beams travelling in different directions. The emerging coloration {{is a form}} of structural coloration. The directions of these beams depend on the spacing of the grating and the wavelength of the light so that the grating acts as the <b>dispersive</b> element. Because of this, gratings are commonly used in monochromators and spectrometers.|$|E
25|$|The Jones matrix due to {{passage through}} a {{transparent}} material {{is dependent on}} the propagation distance as well as the birefringence. The birefringence (as well as the average refractive index) will generally be <b>dispersive,</b> that is, it will vary as a function of optical frequency (wavelength). In the case of non-birefringent materials, however, the 2×2 Jones matrix is the identity matrix (multiplied by a scalar phase factor and attenuation factor), implying no change in polarization during propagation.|$|E
25|$|In {{wavelength}} <b>dispersive</b> analysis, the single-wavelength radiation {{produced by}} the monochromator is passed into a photomultiplier, a detector similar to a Geiger counter, which counts individual photons as they pass through. The counter is a chamber containing a gas that is ionised by X-ray photons. A central electrode is charged at (typically) +1700 V {{with respect to the}} conducting chamber walls, and each photon triggers a pulse-like cascade of current across this field. The signal is amplified and transformed into an accumulating digital count. These counts are then processed to obtain analytical data.|$|E
25|$|Another {{apparent}} contradiction lies in {{the fact}} that the group velocity in anomalously <b>dispersive</b> media is higher than the speed of light. This was investigated by Arnold Sommerfeld (1907, 1914) and Léon Brillouin (1914). They came to the conclusion that in such cases the signal velocity is not equal to the group velocity, but to the front velocity which is never faster than the speed of light. Similarly, it is also argued that the apparent superluminal effects discovered by Günter Nimtz can be explained by a thorough consideration of the velocities involved.|$|E
25|$|Stokes' wave theory — a perturbation-series {{approach}} to the description of weakly nonlinear and <b>dispersive</b> waves, especially successful in deeper water for relative short wavelengths, {{as compared to the}} water depth. However, for long waves the Boussinesq approach—as also applied in the KdV equation—is often preferred. This is because in shallow water the Stokes' perturbation series needs many terms before convergence towards the solution, due to the peaked crests and long flat troughs of the nonlinear waves. While the KdV or Boussinesq models give good approximations for these long nonlinear waves.|$|E
25|$|Rainbows are {{the result}} of a {{combination}} of internal reflection and <b>dispersive</b> refraction of light in raindrops. A single reflection off the backs of an array of raindrops produces a rainbow with an angular size on the sky that ranges from 40° to 42° with red on the outside. Double rainbows are produced by two internal reflections with angular size of 50.5° to 54° with violet on the outside. Because rainbows are seen with the sun 180° away from the centre of the rainbow, rainbows are more prominent the closer the sun is to the horizon.|$|E
25|$|In {{capacitors}} {{in which}} the internal pressure build-up {{was so great that}} the capacitor case was already bulging but the vent had not opened yet, the pH value of the electrolyte could be measured. The electrolyte of the faulty Taiwanese capacitors was alkaline, with a pH of between 7 and 8. Good comparable Japanese capacitors had an electrolyte that was acidic, with a pH of around 4. As it is known that aluminum can be dissolved by alkaline liquids, but not that which is mildly acidic, an energy <b>dispersive</b> X-ray spectroscopy (EDX or EDS) fingerprint analysis of the electrolyte of the faulty capacitors was made, which detected dissolved aluminum in the electrolyte.|$|E
25|$|Spatially encoded {{frequency}} domain OCT (SEFD-OCT, spectral domain or Fourier domain OCT) extracts spectral information by distributing different optical frequencies onto a detector stripe (line-array CCD or CMOS) via a <b>dispersive</b> element (see Fig. 4). Thereby the information {{of the full}} depth scan can be acquired within a single exposure. However, the large signal to noise advantage of FD-OCT is reduced due to the lower dynamic range of stripe detectors with respect to single photosensitive diodes, resulting in an SNR (signal to noise ratio) advantage of ~10 dB at much higher speeds. This is {{not much of a}} problem when working at 1300nm, however, since dynamic range is not a serious problem at this wavelength range.|$|E
25|$|In {{frequency}} domain OCT (FD-OCT) the broadband interference is acquired with spectrally separated detectors (either by encoding the optical frequency {{in time with}} a spectrally scanning source or with a <b>dispersive</b> detector, like a grating and a linear detector array). Due to the Fourier relation (Wiener-Khintchine theorem between the auto correlation and the spectral power density) the depth scan can be immediately calculated by a Fourier-transform from the acquired spectra, without movement of the reference arm. This feature improves imaging speed dramatically, while the reduced losses during a single scan improve the {{signal to noise ratio}} proportional to the number of detection elements. The parallel detection at multiple wavelength ranges limits the scanning range, while the full spectral bandwidth sets the axial resolution.|$|E
25|$|Hepialidae are {{distributed}} on ancient landmasses worldwide except Antarctica {{but with the}} surprising exceptions of Madagascar, the Caribbean islands and in Africa, tropical West Africa. It remains to be borne out if these absences are real as Aenetus cohici was not long ago discovered in New Caledonia. In the Oriental and Neotropical regions hepialids have diversified in rainforest environments, but this not apparently {{the case in the}} Afrotropics. Hepialids mostly have low <b>dispersive</b> powers and do not occur on oceanic islands with the exception of Phassodes on Fiji and Western Samoa and a few species in Japan and Kurile Islands. Whilst the type locality of Eudalaca sanctahelena is from the remote island of St Helena, this is thought to be an error for South Africa.|$|E
500|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{is found}} throughout the temperate and subtropical parts of the Old World; while birds from the northern parts of the range migrate south for winter, their southern counterparts remain resident or make <b>dispersive</b> movements. Eurasian sparrowhawks breed in suitable woodland of any type, with the nest, measuring up to [...] across, built using twigs in a tree. Four or five pale blue, brown-spotted eggs are laid; {{the success of the}} breeding attempt is dependent on the female maintaining a high weight while the male brings her food. The chicks hatch after 33 days and fledge after 24 to 28 days.|$|E
