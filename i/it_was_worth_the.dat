25|$|The {{convoluted}} {{tubes of}} early designs {{such as the}} du Temple and Normand {{were the first to}} go. A multi-row bank of tubes could provide adequate heating area, without this complexity. Tubes also became straighter, mostly to ease their cleaning. Yarrow had demonstrated that straight tubes did not cause any problems with expansion, but circular drums and perpendicular tube entry were both valuable features for a long service life. Where tubes entered drums at an angle, heating and cooling tended to bend the tube back and forth, leading to leaks. A perpendicular entry was easier to expand the tubes for a reliable seal and to avoid these sideways stresses. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> compromise of the Admiralty boiler's bent tube ends to keep these two features, and these tubes were still simple enough in shape to clean easily.|$|E
500|$|In response, Lieutenant General Mike Jackson {{refused to}} obey the order, {{reportedly}} telling him [...] "I'm not going to start the Third World War for you". Jackson has said he refused to take action {{because he did not}} believe <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> risk of a military confrontation with the Russians, instead insisting that troops encircle the airfield. The stand-off lasted two weeks. Russian forces continued to occupy the airport, until eventually an agreement was secured for them to be integrated into peace-keeping duties, while remaining outside of Nato command.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{thought the}} {{expansion}} {{would be worth}} the player's investment if they enjoyed Fallout 4. Kirk McKeand (Eurogamer) said there are no real choices to make in Nuka-World, though it still may be worthy of your time. Kat Bailey (USgamer) liked the expansion, and {{thought there was a}} lot to do in it, but not all of it is interesting. She said the expansion [...] "could be worse, but it could also be a whole lot better", but if you enjoyed Fallout 4, then [...] "there's good reason to pick up Nuka-World." [...] Nic Rowen (Destructoid) noted fans of the genre will probably enjoy Nuka-World, but others will be left unsatisfied. [...] Tassi believed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> $20. Andrew Webster finished his review by saying Nuka-World was only for dedicated players.|$|E

500|$|Writers for Famitsu {{called the}} game [...] "super-simple", {{comparing}} it to Metro-Cross and Paperboy, and calling it a simplified version of Crash Bandicoot. Others have made similar comments. A reviewer for IGN also compared it to Crash Bandicoot, described the gameplay as [...] "simplistic [...] rote memorization based", {{and said that the}} thing the game would be remembered for was its [...] "extremely bizarre premise". They still felt that the game was not bad, and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> price, which they noted was low. James Mielke at GameSpot called the game a [...] "nifty little distraction", and said that the gameplay was similar to the [...] "old-school gaming dynamics of yesteryear". He commented on the low price, but said that it was difficult to find imports of it.|$|E
500|$|With Villeroi {{shadowing}} Marlborough's every move, Marlborough's gamble {{that the}} French would not move against the weakened Dutch {{position in the}} Netherlands paid off. In any case, Marlborough had promised {{to return to the}} Netherlands if a French attack developed there, transferring his troops down the Rhine on barges at a rate of [...] a day. Encouraged by this promise (whatever <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth)</b> <b>the</b> States General agreed to release the Danish contingent of seven battalions and 22 squadrons as a reinforcement. Marlborough reached Ladenburg, in the plain of the Neckar and the Rhine, and there halted for three days to rest his cavalry and allow the guns and infantry to close up. On 6 June he arrived at Wiesloch, south of Heidelberg. The following day, the Allied army swung away from the Rhine towards the hills of the Swabian Jura and the Danube beyond. At last Marlborough's destination was established without doubt.|$|E
500|$|IGN called Super Metroids Virtual Console version a [...] "must-own", commenting that {{although}} the game was released nine months after the Wii launched, they felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> wait. For players who have never played Super Metroid, IGN claims that they owe themselves as gamers to [...] "finally find out about what you've been missing all these years". In his review for GameSpot, Frank Provo found it [...] "absolutely astonishing that Nintendo let 13 years go by before making Super Metroid readily available again", but considered {{the most important thing}} was that players [...] "can now play this masterpiece without having to track down the original Super Nintendo Entertainment System cartridge or fumble with legally questionable emulators". Despite admitting that the Virtual Console version was essentially [...] "nothing more than a no-frills, emulated version of a 13-year-old SNES game" [...] that was no longer cutting-edge, he was still pleased with it and reiterated his belief that Super Metroid is [...] "one of the best 2D action adventure games ever produced".|$|E

2500|$|Although Hundertwasser first {{achieved}} notoriety for his boldly-coloured paintings, he is {{more widely}} known for his individual architectural designs. [...] These designs use irregular forms, and incorporate natural features of the landscape. The Hundertwasserhaus apartment block in Vienna has undulating floors ("an uneven floor is a melody to the feet"), a roof covered with earth and grass, and large trees growing from inside the rooms, with limbs extending from windows. He took no payment {{for the design of}} Hundertwasserhaus, declaring that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> investment to [...] "prevent something ugly from going up in its place".|$|E
2500|$|The Christian Science Monitor {{published}} a review by David Holahan on November 21, 2012, {{in which he}} spoke of the comprehensive coverage offered in the book. Holahan called The Black Count a [...] "remarkable and almost compulsively researched account" [...] and stated [...] "the author spent a decade on the case, and it shows". The Daily Mail's Christopher Hudson called Dumas [...] "the Daddy of All Action Heroes" [...] and said that The Black Count is [...] "brilliantly researched". Hudson wrote that [...] "Reiss spent long years researching this book, trawling the Caribbean, Europe and the Middle East. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> trouble." ...|$|E

Yardbirds' chronicler Gregg Russo notes the result was that [...] "many [...] have a demo quality that time shortages would not allow them to change".

2500|$|Zorn's file-card {{method of}} {{organizing}} sound blocks into an overall structure largely {{depended on the}} musicians he chose, the way they interpreted what was written on the file cards, and their relationship with Zorn. [...] "I'm {{not going to sit}} in some ivory tower and pass my scores down to the players." [...] said Zorn, [...] "I have to be there with them, and that's why I started playing saxophone, so that I could meet musicians. I still feel that I have to earn a player's trust before they can play my music.

2500|$|The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode the highest grade of the site, an [...] "A". Alasdair Wilkins writes [...] "Steven Moffat’s script is inordinately clever {{in how it}} uses {{the trappings of a}} fluffy, silly Christmas special to crank up the scariness of a good old-fashioned monster story. But after all that, tonight’s episode manages {{something}} that not all of its Christmas predecessors manage, as it anchors its story in something that feels particular to the holidays. There is a melancholy to the comings and goings that define this time of year, and “Last Christmas” recognises that from its title outward." [...] Praise was also given to Capaldi's performance in the special, [...] "If there’s one thing we never really saw in Capaldi’s first season as the Doctor, {{it was the kind of}} unabashed joy that so animated the 10th and 11th Doctors and made the tail-end of the 9th Doctor’s journey—including his Santa claim to Rose at the end of “The Doctor Dances”—so powerful. Well, it takes the full hour, but “Last Christmas” gets us there. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> wait." [...] Digital Spy awarded the episode a 4 out of 5, stating that [...] "Moffat pulls off a number of difficult balancing acts spectacularly well, refusing to deliver another throwaway special that's heavy on the frothy festive cheer but light on real substance". They closed their review by saying [...] "Last Christmas is an absolute cracker. The festive fun factor is high, as is only right and proper, but it's often been said that Doctor Who is at its best when its roots are showing and here Moffat apes both Christopher Nolan's Inception and Ridley Scott's Alien to provide the viewer with both food for thought and fuel for our nightmares". The Daily Telegraph awarded the episode a 4 out of 5, calling it [...] "marvellously merry" [...] and stating that it [...] "had heart as well as head, so ended like a festive special should: happily, with a cockle-warming cosy glow". The Mirror also praised the episode, saying that it [...] "might have borrowed, somewhat heavily, from a few films, but it still had the Doctor Who spin". They also expressed praise over Clara's continuation, saying [...] "It’s great news that we will have another series with these two verbally sparring" [...] and closed their review by claiming the episode [...] "was [...] real Christmas treat to join Capaldi and Coleman on another adventure, and it was the icing on the cake that Clara is staying with the Doctor".|$|E
