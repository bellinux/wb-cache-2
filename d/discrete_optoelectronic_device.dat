40|$|For {{the last}} 25 years, {{microwave}} photonic (MWP) systems and links have relied {{almost exclusively on}} <b>discrete</b> <b>optoelectronic</b> <b>devices,</b> standard optical fibers and fiber-based components. With this concept, various functionalities like RF signal generation, distribution, processing and analysis have been demonstrated. However, configurations with discrete devices are bulky, expensive, high in power consumption and severely lacking in reconfigurability. We believe that a new trend termed as integrated microwave photonics [1] is emerging. Integrated MWP addresses the incorporation of MWP subsystems in photonic integrated circuit (PIC) technologies, to achieve reduction in inter-element coupling loss, power consumption and cost. But more importantly, photonic (and eventually electronic) integration aims at increased MWP systems performance and reconfigurability unprecedented by more traditional solutions...|$|R
40|$|The {{prospect}} of an all-fibre optical communications network in which light can be generated, modulated and detected within the fibre itself {{without the need for}} <b>discrete</b> <b>optoelectronic</b> <b>devices</b> is an appealing one. However, to become a reality, this approach requires the incorporation of optoelectronic materials and functionalities into silica fibres to create a new breed of semiconductor-fibre hybrid devices for performing various tasks. Here, we report the integration of precisely doped semiconductor materials and high-quality rectifying semiconductor junctions into microstructured optical fibres, enabling high-speed, in-fibre functionalities such as photodetection at telecommunications wavelengths. These semiconductor-fibre hybrid devices exhibit a bandwidth of up to 3 GHz and seamless coupling to standard single-mode optical fibres...|$|R
40|$|Polarization {{insensitive}} 1. 5 micrometer QW optical amplifiers, modulators, and detectors were fabricated using a novel, simple, post-growth, integratable technique. The process utilizes ion-implantation-induced, spatially selective, {{quantum well}} (QW) shape modification. A simple model shows {{that if the}} interdiffusion rate of the anions is larger {{than that of the}} cations, the blue shift in the ground state heavy hole transition energy after implantation and annealing is greater than the light hole state blue shift, merging the two bands and thus eliminating the difference between the TE (transverse electric) and TM (transverse magnetic) waveguide propagation modes. Current- voltage measurements indicate that junction characteristics are well maintained after processing. This simple technique for fabricating <b>discrete</b> polarization insensitive <b>optoelectronic</b> <b>devices</b> is readily extended to the monolithic integration of such devices along with other passive and active <b>optoelectronic</b> <b>devices</b> and provides a pathway to practical photonic integrated circuits.

40|$|Lab-on-chip (LOC) {{systems are}} {{becoming}} increasingly popular for biomedical science as they present the opportunity to combine compact and efficient microelectronics together with microfluidics enabling new applications in point-of-care diagnostics. This system integration however, poses significant challenges in the assembly of such devices for mass manufacture. Specifically, to achieve a robust fluidic isolation, an insulating material must be deposited to seal the chip and wire bonds but allow fluid to access the sensing surface. This is typically achieved by using an insulating epoxy for encapsulation but requires several processing steps {{in order to become}} planar and reliably interface with the microfluidics; a technique with many limitations. Towards addressing these challenges, this thesis proposes to develop a non-galvanic means of achieving both power transfer to the chip and bi-directional data communication such that the system requires no bond pads (or delicate bond wires). The aim is to achieve this specifically via a free space optical link (i. e. to external <b>discrete</b> <b>optoelectronic</b> <b>devices)</b> with the additional constraint that any structures designed on chip are implementable in a commercially available, unmodified CMOS technology. Furthermore, {{in order to maintain the}} desired benefits of a “bondpad-less” chip, the platform must utilise no off-chip components. This thesis develops the underlying devices required towards achieving the aim whilst satisfying all constraints. Specifically devices tasked with optical energy harvesting, optical data input and optical data output are tackled. The thesis begins by outlining the motivations for this research (Chapter 1) and reviewing the relevant state-of-the-art (Chapter 2) including a concise overview of alternative methods for achieving the underlying aims. The relevant theory, pertinent to electro-optical phenomena at semiconductor junctions is then developed within the context of CMOS technology (Chapter 3). More fundamental, background theory is also included in appendix A. That pertains to the propagation of light in Silicon and mechanisms of photon absorption in doped Silicon. Original contributions within the domain of theory include developing the phenomenon of free-carrier absorption (FCA) applied to a realistic, CMOS-based junction, identifying key variables, expressions and analyzing the expected level of performance. Then, for the first time, this thesis demonstrates free-space optical modulation in a standard CMOS technology. A large portion of this work (Chapter 4 - for design repository see appendix B) is thus devoted to the design, implementation and testing of prototype devices for use as data read-out elements. A variety of modulator devices featuring differing geometries, created by distinct doping procedures and implemented in different CMOS technological nodes (UMC 0. 13 [mu]m, IBM 0. 18 [mu]m and AMS 0. 35 [mu]m) are presented, tested and compared. This allows for modulator performance to be examined in relation to key design choices made at the physical device layout and technology choice levels. This thesis then develops the common data read-in and power scavenging mechanism, along with associated circuits (Chapter 5). Once again structures designed with different geometries and created by different manufacturing processes in different technological nodes are presented, tested and compared, yielding an indication towards underlying trends. Key contributions here include extracted photodiode model parameters that express the contributions of vertical and lateral junction components to photocurrent generation, by junction 'family' and by CMOS process.
