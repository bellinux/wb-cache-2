40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the implications of}} fair value liability <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> losses arising from the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159 (hereafter FAS 159).

Further analysis indicates that fair value <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> losses from liabilities attributable to the change in a firm’s own credit risk, which are considered counter-intuitive by critics of fair value accounting for liabilities, are also positively related to returns. Lastly, we document that the volatility of earnings that incorporate FAS 159 liability fair value <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> losses is positively associated with market measures of firm risk.

Little is known, however, about how neural representations of an anticipated incentive might {{be influenced by the}} available alternatives. We used event-related FMRI to investigate the activation in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), while we varied the available alternative incentives in a monetary incentive delay task. Some task blocks included only uncertain <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> losses; others included the same uncertain <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> losses intermixed with certain <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> losses. The availability of certain <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> losses increased NAcc activation for uncertain losses and decreased the difference between uncertain <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> losses. We suggest that this pattern of activation can result from reference point changes across blocks, and that the worst available loss may serve as an important anchor for NAcc activation. These findings imply that NAcc activation represents anticipated incentive value relative to the current context of available alternative <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> losses...|$|R

Oxendine picked up three yards on two short runs, then Druckenmiller advanced the Hokies into the Nebraska side of the field with a 19-yard pass to Jennings. Oxendine was stopped for no <b>gain</b> <b>and</b> Druckenmiller threw an incompletion, but on third down, Druckenmiller connected with White for a 33-yard <b>gain</b> <b>and</b> Tech's first touchdown of the second half. The extra point was good, and the Hokies again trimmed Nebraska's lead to three points: 2421. Tech's drive covered 80 yards in 12 plays and 4:56 of game time.|$|E

40|$|Existing {{studies on}} bank takeovers {{have not been}} able to {{distinguish}} among the three competing motives: synergy, agency, and hubris.

Our results also suggest that hubris may explain the positive target <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> zero or negative acquirer gains found in this and many other bank takeover studies. Lastly, evidence exists to suggest that agency, along with hubris, may explain takeovers with negative total gains (JEL G 21, G 34). Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998. ...|$|R
5|$|Hyponatremia, {{an unusually}} {{low level of}} sodium in the blood that may cause {{confusion}} and seizures, is found in 40% of cases. This {{may be caused by}} low cortisol levels or by inappropriate release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary. Several other hormonal deficiencies may develop in the subacute phase. 50% have a deficiency in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), leading to undersecretion of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland and characteristic symptoms such as fatigue, weight <b>gain,</b> <b>and</b> cold intolerance. 75% develop a deficiency to gonadotropins (LH and FSH), which control the reproductive hormone glands.

40|$|Affective {{neuroscience}} {{has helped}} guide research and theory development in judgment and decision-making by revealing {{the role of}} emotional processes in choice behavior, especially when risk is involved. Evidence is emerging that qualitatively and quantitatively different processes {{may be involved in}} risky decision-making for <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> losses. We start by reviewing behavioral work by Kahneman and Tversky (1979) and others, which shows that risk-taking differs for potential <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> potential losses. We then turn to the literature in decision neuroscience to support the gain versus loss distinction. Relying in part on data from a new task that separates risky decision-making for <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> losses, we test a neural model that assigns unique mechanisms for risky decision-making involving potential losses. Included are studies using patients with lesions to brain areas specified as important in the model and studies with healthy individuals whose brains are scanned to reveal activation in these and other areas during risky decision-making. In some cases, there is evidence that <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> losses are processed in different regions of the brain, while in other cases the same region appears to process risk in a different manner for <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> losses. At a more general level, we provide strong support for the notion that decisions involving risk-taking for <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> decisions involving risk-taking for losses represent different psychological processes. At a deeper level, we present mounting evidence that different neural structures play different roles in guiding risky choices in these different domains. Some structures are differentially activated by risky <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> risky losses while others respond uniquely in one domain or the other. Taken together, these studies support a clear functional dissociation between risk-taking for <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> risk-taking for losses, and further dissociation at the neural level...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the way investors react to prior gains/losses. We directly examine investor reactions to different definitions of <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> losses (i. e., overall wealth, paper <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> losses, <b>and</b> realized capital <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> losses) <b>and</b> investigate how <b>gains</b> <b>and</b> losses in one category of wealth (e. g., real estate) affect holdings in other categories (e. g., financial assets). We show that investors change their holdings of risky assets {{as a function}} of both financial <b>and</b> real estate <b>gains.</b> Prior gains increase risk-taking, while prior losses reduce it. To interpret our results, we consider and compare three alternative hypotheses of investor behavior: prospect theory, house money effect and standard utility theory with decreasing risk aversion. Our evidence fails to support loss aversion, pointing {{in the direction of the}} house money effect or standard utility theory. Investors consider wealth in its entirety, and risk-taking in financial markets is affected by gains/losses in overall wealth, financial wealth, and real estate wealth. Copyright Springer 2005...|$|R

5|$|Little was not {{the first}} to <b>gain</b> <b>and</b> lose his fortune in the stock market, but he was a {{pioneering}} speculator, the first to rely on his ability to predict market fluctuations to inform his speculations instead of bidding with what would today be considered insider information. He was the first Great Bear; before his rapid rise speculation and market manipulation was virtually unknown in the stock market, as no one before him had had the still nerve and financial foresight necessary to profit from such risky endeavors, and many market historians consider him the first modern stock market tycoon. His ability to <b>gain</b> <b>and</b> lose fortunes on a day-by-day basis was a microcosm of the meteoric possibilities and insecurities of speculation, and after his death and even during his life many other investors tried to imitate his success, with little success. His victory over the Erie Railroad scheme (and market cornering activities in general) inspired similar plots in the years thereafter; in 1863 the industrialist Cornelius Vanderbilt successfully cornered the Harlem Railroad {{in much the same way}} that Little had done almost thirty years earlier, and fell into a corner trap formed by Daniel Drew and others himself in the later Erie War.
