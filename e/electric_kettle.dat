60|$|Sir Richmond's {{bedroom was}} a large {{apartment}} in which sleep {{seemed to have been}} an admitted necessity rather than a principal purpose. On one hand it opened into a business-like dressing and bath room, on the other into the day study. It bore witness to the nocturnal habits {{of a man who had}} long lived a life of irregular impulses to activity and dislocated hours and habits. There was a desk and reading lamp for night work near the fireplace, an <b>electric</b> <b>kettle</b> for making tea at night, a silver biscuit tin; all the apparatus for the lonely intent industry of the small hours. There was a bookcase of bluebooks, books of reference and suchlike material, and some files. Over the mantelpiece was an enlarged photograph of Lady Hardy and a plain office calendar. The desk was littered with the galley proofs of the Minority Report upon which Sir Richmond had been working up to the moment of his hasty retreat to bed. And lying among the proofs, as though it had been taken out and looked at quite recently was the photograph of a girl. For a moment Dr. Martineau's mind hung in doubt and then he knew it for the young American of Stonehenge. How that affair had ended he did not know. And now it was not his business to know.|$|E
50|$|In {{the latter}} part of the 19th century, <b>electric</b> <b>kettles</b> were {{introduced}} as an alternative to stove top kettles. In 1893 the Crompton and Co. firm in the United Kingdom started featuring <b>electric</b> <b>kettles</b> in their catalogue.The early <b>electric</b> <b>kettles</b> were quite primitive as the heating element couldn't be immersed in the water. Instead, a separate compartment underneath the water storage area in the kettle was used to house the electric heating element. The design was inefficient even relative to the conventional stove-top kettles of the time.|$|R
