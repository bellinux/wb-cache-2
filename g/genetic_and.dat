5|$|After humans {{migrated}} out {{of their}} ancestral environment of eastern Africa, they were exposed to new climates and challenges. Thus, Wade argues, human evolution did not end with behavioural modernity, but continued to be shaped by the different environments and lifestyles of each continent. While many adaptations happened in parallel across human populations, Wade believes that genetic isolation – either because of geography or hostile tribalism – also facilitated a degree of independent evolution, leading to <b>genetic</b> <b>and</b> cultural differentiation from the ancestral population and giving rise to different human races and languages.|$|E

Conversely, type 2 does not show a family history, presents after age 40, and is not associated with HLA-Cw6. Type 1 accounts for about 75% of persons with psoriasis.|$|E

5|$|Asthma {{is thought}} to be caused by a {{combination}} of <b>genetic</b> <b>and</b> environmental factors. Environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens. Other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers. Diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms, response to therapy over time, and spirometry. Asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate.|$|E
5|$|Dyslexia is {{believed}} to be caused by both <b>genetic</b> <b>and</b> environmental factors. Some cases run in families. It often occurs in people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and is associated with similar difficulties with numbers. It may begin in adulthood {{as the result of a}} traumatic brain injury, stroke, or dementia. The underlying mechanisms of dyslexia are problems within the brain's language processing. Dyslexia is diagnosed through a series of tests of memory, spelling, vision, and reading skills. Dyslexia is separate from reading difficulties caused by hearing or vision problems or by insufficient teaching.|$|E

However, this has not been done, largely due to its medical importance, and E. coli remains one of the most diverse bacterial species: only 20% of the genes in a typical E. coli genome is shared among all strains.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Nowadays the {{possibilities}} of evolutionary algorithms are widely used in many optimization and classification tasks. Evolutionary algorithms are stochastic search methods that try to emulate Darwin’s principle of natural evolution. There are (at least) four paradigms {{in the world of}} evolutionary algorithms: evolutionary programming, evolution strategies, <b>genetic</b> algorithms <b>and</b> <b>genetic</b> programming. This paper analyzes present-day approaches of <b>genetic</b> algorithms <b>and</b> <b>genetic</b> programming <b>and</b> examines {{the possibilities}} of genetic programming that will be used in further research.

Established acquired causes include serious brain trauma, stroke, tumours and problems in the brain {{as a result of}} a previous infection. In about 60% of cases the cause is unknown. Epilepsies caused by genetic, congenital, or developmental conditions are more common among younger people, while brain tumors and strokes are more likely in older people.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of the {{heritability}} {{of schizophrenia}} is around 80%, which implies that 80% {{of the individual}} differences in risk to schizophrenia is explained by individual differences in genetics. These estimates vary {{because of the difficulty}} in separating <b>genetic</b> <b>and</b> environmental influences. The greatest single risk factor for developing schizophrenia is having a first-degree relative with the disease (risk is 6.5%); more than 40% of monozygotic twins of those with schizophrenia are also affected. If one parent is affected the risk is about 13% and if both are affected the risk is nearly 50%.|$|E

The Genotypic Coefficient of Variation (GCV) and Phenotypic Coefficient of Variation (PCV) were low to moderate with low heritability <b>and</b> <b>genetic</b> advance for harvest index indicating that the character is highly influenced by non-additive <b>genetic</b> effects <b>and</b> thus the selection would be ineffective. The moderate heritability <b>and</b> <b>genetic</b> advance were recorded for grain quality characters viz., kernel length, kernel breadth and L/B ratio. Moreover phenotypic and genotypic coefficients of variances were low which indicated the presence of non-additive gene action...|$|R
5|$|Ninox boobook plesseni {{is known}} from Pantar and Alor Islands {{in the eastern}} Lesser Sunda Islands. It was {{described}} by Erwin Stresemann in 1929. The upperparts are grey-brown and heavily spotted and marked with white, giving rise to a cross-barred pattern on its back. Its underparts have longitudinal white streaks and its tail is prominently barred. It lives in Eucalyptus urophylla woodlands, and has an unusual low-pitched call different to subspecies boobook. <b>Genetic</b> <b>and</b> call analysis show it to be markedly divergent to the Australian populations of the southern boobook, leading Gwee and colleagues to suggest it be reclassified as a separate species.|$|E

Locally common, it is known to the local people as Tuterui and Kokorok. <b>Genetic</b> <b>and</b> call analysis show it to be markedly divergent from the Australian populations of the southern boobook, leading Gwee and colleagues to suggest it be reclassified as a separate species.|$|E
5|$|Roy E. Halling {{designated}} a lectotype specimen in 1983 from Frost's original collections. Early molecular evidence {{suggested that the}} lilac-brown bolete was genetically distinct from the genera in which it had formerly been placed. In 2012, Halling and colleagues published molecular evidence indicating that the species did not belong in either Tylopilus or Leccinum as it does not share a recent common ancestor with either of those genera. Recognizing its <b>genetic</b> <b>and</b> morphological distinctiveness, they created the genus Sutorius, with S.eximius as the type species. As of 2015, the only other species in Sutorius is S.australiensis, found in Australia.|$|E
