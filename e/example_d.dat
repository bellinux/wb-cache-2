2500|$|Delissea {{is similar}} to Cyanea in many ways, differing {{primarily}} in the flower (with a small knob on the dorsal side) and fruit (dark purple; most Cyanea fruit are orange, though some are also purple or blue). [...] It is notable {{in part because it}} has suffered so much: only three of the nine species known to science are still extant, and one of these (D. undulata) is extinct in the wild. [...] Several species are known only from type specimens collected in the late 1800s. [...] Several species are very poorly known, and their status as species is questionable. [...] For <b>example,</b> <b>D.</b> fallax and D. parviflora are both from Hawaii and their flowers are identical; it is possible that they represent different growth forms of the same species (both Delissea and Cyanea are known to undergo changes in vegetative morphology during the lifetime of the plant). [...] Delissea lauliiana was known only from the type, which was destroyed in Berlin during World War II. [...] All three of these are believed to be extinct, and unless new specimens turn up {{there is no way to}} resolve questions about them.|$|E

The ellipse was a favoured geometrical shape at the time, an obvious <b>example</b> <b>bing</b> the elliptical pattern in the paving around the Marcus Aurelius statue at Piazza del Campidoglio. Around the parterre, two rows of trees were planted. In 1711, the garden complex was remodelled, before it was given up in 1747 the garden was removed {{to make room for}} military drils, with some of the trees being dug altogether up, leaving only the equestrian statue. Some of the trees were dug up and reused for the establishment of the avenue Østre Allé. New rows of elm trees were planted around the statue in 1855-56, but by 1998 they were dying from Dutch elm disease and removed. In 2001, 80 lime trees were planted as part of a major refurbishment of the square.|$|R
