40|$|Over the years, {{the conduct}} of <b>preliminary</b> <b>examinations</b> has gained {{increasing}} importance at the International Criminal Court (ICC). One notable aspect {{in this area is}} the hugely diverging length of such examinations, ranging from one week for the situation in Libya to 12 years (and rising) for the situation in Colombia. This article critically interrogates the repeated claim of the Prosecutor that the absence of any provisions regulating the length of <b>preliminary</b> <b>examinations</b> was a deliberate decision of the drafters of the Rome Statute, leaving her with unfettered discretion in that area. Instead, it is suggested that the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in prioritizing <b>preliminary</b> <b>examinations</b> is legally limited through the obligation to ensure effective investigations, demanding reasonably swift responses because evidence vanishes over time — witnesses disappear, memories fade, and data gets lost (the ‘golden hour’ principle). Furthermore, {{the conduct of}} <b>preliminary</b> <b>examinations</b> is also limited through the legal and policy commitment to impartiality, including the appearance of impartiality. A robust debate about a structured and transparent process of prioritization at the <b>preliminary</b> <b>examination</b> stage is thus overdue. It is proposed that the Prosecutor should introduce a policy commitment to conclude <b>preliminary</b> <b>examinations</b> within a defined time limit. Such a policy would be an important step towards a more structured method of situation selection, and would reduce the possibility that decision-making processes in more contentious situations are postponed for obscure reasons...|$|R

To show which item in a sentence of the law the reference is related to, the particular part of that sentence is printed in bold. - References have been inserted to related Articles and Rules at the beginning of each Article and Rule or, if appropriate, at the beginning of a subsection of an Article or Rule. - Summaries of the contents of the references are included to help the reader to quickly determine the relevance of the article or rule. - The majority of the references in this book are to the PCT.

40|$|Historically, bone defects {{resulting}} from trauma, disease or infection {{are treated with}} autograft or allograft. Autograft is bone transplanted from a non-critical area of the skeleton and allograft is bone donated from {{another member of the}} same species. The drawbacks with these treatments such as limited availability, donor site morbidity, high cost and disease transmission have driven increasing use of bone graft substitute (BGS) materials. These represent 15 % of the £ 1. 6 billion global orthobiologics market. BGS materials available to date are not suitable for use in grafts that are intrinsic to the stability of the skeleton. Thus, the aim for this project was to fabricate an off the shelf and economically viable BGS that will support the skeletal structure whilst healing occurs. This project employed an empirical approach utilising both rapid prototyping (RP) and conventional manufacturing processes to produce novel BGSs. A range of RP techniques were attempted and discovered to be unsuitable {{as a result of their}} long build and postprocessing times, poor availability of suitable materials, and undesirable surface finish. Experiments with injection moulding and laser drilling of polylactic acid (PLA) successfully produced 10 mm blocks with a compressive strength of 67 – 80 MPa and compressive modulus of 1. 5 – 2. 2 GPa. This line of research led to the hypothesis that ceramic extrusion, a process hitherto untested for use in bone tissue engineering (BTE), may be feasible for production of a novel and high strength BGS. In collaboration with an international expert in the manufacture of ceramic monoliths it was possible, for the first time, to manufacture hydroxyapatite (HA) monoliths by adapting the process used for manufacture of automotive exhaust catalysts. These HA monoliths exhibited a compressive strength of 142 – 265 MPa and compressive modulus of 3. 2 – 4. 4 GPa. The exceptional strength of these monoliths match the properties of cortical bone whilst retaining the high levels of porosity (> 60 %) found in cancellous bone. This combination of strength and porosity will enable treatment of large structural bone defects where the high strength will withstand typical skeletal forces whilst the high porosity allows blood vessels to infiltrate the monolith and begin the healing process. Furthermore, these HA monoliths support the proliferation and differentiation of human osteoblast-like MG 63 cells and compare very favourably with a market leading BGS material in terms of their biological performance. It is suggested that this work will result in the development of a new family of high strength and high porosity BGSs for use in challenging clinical situations. The <b>International</b> <b>Preliminary</b> <b>Examination</b> Report for the patent issued to the author (WO 2007 / 125323) decreed that all 45 claims contained novelty and an inventive step. Two successful applications for research funding have raised nearly £ 50, 000 that helped fund this research effort.
