40|$|Substantial {{differences}} exist among fuel taxes between various countries. These differences represent {{a form of}} fiscal competition that has undesirable side effects because it leads to cross-border fuelling and hence to extra kilometers driven. One possible {{way of dealing with}} this problem of low fuel taxes in neighbouring coountries is to introduce a spatial differentiation of taxes: low near the border and higher farther away. This paper contains an empirical analysis of the consequences of such a spatial graduation of fuel taxes for the Netherlands. Impacts of fuelling behaviour, vehicle kilometers driven, tax receipts, and sales by owners of gas stations are analysed. The appropriate slope of the <b>graduation</b> <b>curve</b> in order to prevent fuel-fetching trips is also discussed. Our conclusion is that in a small country such as The Netherlands, a spatial graduation of fuel taxes will lead to considerable problems, even when the <b>graduation</b> <b>curve</b> is not steep that fuel-fetching trips are prevented. The reasonis that - given their activity patterns - car drivers will change the location of their fuelling activity leading to substantial problems for owners of gas stations in areas with high taxes...|$|E
40|$|We review various {{representations}} of the median and related aggregation functions. An advantage of the median is that it discards extreme values of the inputs, and hence exhibits a better central tendency than the arithmetic mean. However, {{the value of the}} median depends on only one or two central inputs. Our aim is to design median-like aggregation functions whose value depends on several central inputs. Such functions will preserve the stability of the median against extreme values, but will take more inputs into account. A method based on <b>graduation</b> <b>curves</b> is presented. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Proposed control {{equipment}} scheme {{is based on}} acoustic Helmholtz resonator property to change its resonance frequency when sound speed {{in the vicinity of}} its throat inlet is changed. So this kind of resonator with pressure measuring acoustic transducer is installed in well known Pitou probe static pressure volume envelope, slightly changing its construction. To use Pitou probe of new type, except of difference between dynamic and static pressure conventional measurement, one must additionally control acoustic pressure spectrum maximum frequency observed in resonator volume by means of spectrum analyzer or other frequency measuring device connected to transducer. <b>Graduation</b> <b>curves</b> for Helmholtz resonator frequency are presented showing that resonance frequency change is linearly dependent on sound speed change and - by square root law - on temperature change. Initial experimental results conducted in model circumstances (in air) are presented giving possibility to estimate effect of measuring equipment proposed...|$|R
