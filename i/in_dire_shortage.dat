50|$|Soon after {{assuming}} command, {{the coup}} d‘état of February 1966 took place. By {{the terms and}} conditions of service of the expatriate British Joint Services Training Team (BJSTT), no British personnel were {{to be involved in}} duties associated with the coup in Ghana. It was therefore the added responsibility of ships commanded by Ghanaian naval officers to undertake all patrol duties at sea and protect the territorial sovereignty of Ghana. When the dust settled, Dzang was appointed the training officer at the Takoradi Naval Base in 1967. In 1968, he was given additional duties as the base administrative officer. With the BJSTT not in full control because of the military government, the Navy in particular was <b>in</b> <b>dire</b> <b>shortage</b> of experienced senior personnel. The substantive Chief of Naval Staff (CNS) and Navy Commander, Rear Admiral David Hanson, had also been relieved of his duties and appointed defence advisor to the High Commission in London. Air Marshall M.A. Otu, the Chief of Air Staff, was appointed Acting Chief of Naval Staff as well, while Commodore Krishnan of the Indian Navy was commissioned to review the Ghana Navy. With a Ghanaian-Indian supporting staff, Krishnan’s mandate included assessing the personnel situation in order to “Ghanaianise” the top jobs and afford senior Ghanaian Officers the opportunity to perform these top administrative jobs. He was also to review the Navy fleet and recommend appropriate vessels for acquisition. The government accepted most of his recommendations and seven of the most senior executive officers were selected for these senior appointments ashore and at sea in rotation, so that a suitable candidate would emerge for appointment as Chief of Naval Staff and Navy Commander.|$|E

50|$|Probably {{the most}} serious and {{long-lasting}} effect on the economy was the <b>dire</b> <b>shortage</b> of highly educated personnel caused by {{the closing of the}} universities.

Of those that did, the Commonwealth Boomerang {{was probably the}} most successful, but even then it was most effectively used in the ground support role. The Heinkel He 162 entered mass production and even squadron service, shooting down some opponents, but its effectiveness was limited by a <b>dire</b> <b>shortage</b> of fuel <b>in</b> the collapsing Reich.|$|R

The numbers were made up with ordinary volunteers but the Public Schools Battalion titles would remain, some of the battalions would be disbanded {{during the course of the}} war.|$|R
5000|$|The {{famine in}} Ukraine took place from August-September 1932 to July 1933.

5000|$|The African Storybook (ASb) is a {{literacy}} {{initiative that}} provides openly licensed picture storybooks for early {{reading in the}} languages of Africa. Developed and hosted by Saide, the ASb has an interactive website that enables users to read, create, download, translate, and adapt stories. The initiative addresses the <b>dire</b> <b>shortage</b> of children’s storybooks in African languages, crucial for children’s literacy development. As of April 2016 {{there are more than}} 700 unique stories in 100 languages spoken in Africa, including English, French, and Portuguese, for a total of over 2500 stories.|$|R
40|$|The World Health Organization {{estimates}} {{a global}} deficit of about 12. 9 million skilled health professionals (midwives, nurses, and physicians) by 2035. These shortages limit {{the ability of}} countries, particularly resource-constrained countries, to deliver basic health care, to respond to emerging and more complex needs, and to teach, graduate, and retain their future health professionals—a vicious cycle that is perpetuated and has profound implications for health security. The Global Health Service Partnership (GHSP) is a unique collaboration between the Peace Corps, President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, Seed and host-country institutions, which aims to strengthen the breadth and quality of medical and nursing education and care delivery <b>in</b> places with <b>dire</b> <b>shortages</b> of health professionals. Nurse and physician educators are seconded to host institutions to serve as visiting faculty alongside their local colleagues. They serve for 1 [*]year with many staying longer. Educational and clinical best practices are shared, {{emphasis is placed on}} integration of theory and practice across the academic–clinical domains and the teaching and learning environment is expanded to include implementation science and dissemination of locally tailored and sustainable practice innovations. In the first 3 [*]years (2013 – 2016) GHSP placed 97 nurse and physician educators in three countries (Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda). These educators have taught 454 courses and workshops to 8, 321 trainees, faculty members, and practicing health professionals across the curriculum and in myriad specialties. Mixed-methods evaluation included key stakeholder interviews with host institution faculty and students who indicate that the addition of GHSP enhanced clinical teaching (quality and breadth) resulting in improved clinical skills, confidence, and ability to connect theory to practice and critical thinking. The outputs and outcomes from four exemplars which focus on the translation of evidence to practice through implementation science are included. Findings from the first 3 [*]years of GHSP suggest that an innovative, locally tailored and culturally appropriate multi-country academic–clinical partnership program that addresses national health priorities is feasible and generated new knowledge and best practices relevant to capacity building for nursing and medical education. This in turn has implications for improving the health of populations who suffer a disproportionate burden of global disease...|$|R

40|$|The City of Boston and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts have {{attempted}} to develop air rights over the Boston Extension of the Massachusetts Turnpike ever since its construction during the 1960 s. There is widespread agreement among politicians, developers and residents that such development would solve myriad existing problems— from aesthetics to safety, to a <b>dire</b> <b>shortage</b> of groundwater. Nevertheless, very little has been built and the turnpike remains an open scar, dividing the urban landscape and undermining important civic objectives. This Note attempts to explain the historical and legal obstacles that have prevented the development of air rights: namely, a misunderstanding of city planning, a weak and belated home rule amendment, and the lingering effects of an Irish-Yankee rivalry...|$|R
25|$|Food {{shipments}} <b>in</b> case of <b>dire</b> local <b>shortage</b> {{are generally}} uncontroversial; but as Amartya Sen has shown, most famines involve a local lack of income {{rather than of}} food. In such situations, food aid—as opposed to financial aid—has the effect of destroying local agriculture and serves mainly to benefit Western agribusiness which are vastly overproducing food {{as a result of}} agricultural subsidies. Historically, food aid is more highly correlated with excess supply in Western countries than with the needs of developing countries. Foreign aid has been an integral part of African economic development since the 1980s.|$|R

50|$|The {{revolution}} {{was led by}} Calixto García, having {{been one of the}} few revolutionary leaders who did not sign the Pact of Zanjón. Among the other prominent leaders were Jose Maceo (the brother of Antonio Maceo), Guillermo Moncada, Emilo Nuñez. The revolutionaries faced many problems which were difficult to overcome. They lacked experienced leaders other than García, and they had a <b>dire</b> <b>shortage</b> of weapons and ammunition. Further, they had no foreign allies to help them, and the population was both exhausted from the Ten Years' War and lacked faith in the possibility of victory, desiring peace instead. In the west of the island, most of the revolutionary leaders were arrested. The rest of the leaders were forced to capitulate throughout 1879 and 1880, and by September 1880, the rebels had been completely defeated.|$|R
50|$|While Lévi-Strauss {{generally}} discounted {{the relevance}} of alliance theory in Africa, a particularly strong concern for incest is a fundamental issue among the age systems of East Africa. Here, the avoidance between men of an age-set and their daughters is altogether more intense {{than in any other}} sexual avoidance. Paraphrasing Lévi-Strauss's argument, without this avoidance, the rivalries for power between age-sets, coupled with the close bonds of sharing between age-mates, could lead to a sharing of daughters as spouses. Young men entering the age system would then find a <b>dire</b> <b>shortage</b> of marriageable girls, and extended families would be in danger of dying out. Thus, by parading this avoidance of their daughters, senior men make these girls available for younger age-sets and their marriages form alliances that mitigate the rivalries for power.|$|R
