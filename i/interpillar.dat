5000|$|The {{station is}} {{considered}} to be the first in Moscow of the modified column tri-span [...] "Sorokonozhka" [...] design which signified that the era where functionality dominated metro architecture had ceased. The number of pillars was lowered from 40 to 26, and the <b>interpillar</b> distance increased from 4 to 6.5 metres. The architect, Robert Pogrebnoi, applied a decoration of pink marble to the pillars of varying shades. The walls were also decorated with marble instead of ceramic tiles for the first time. The grey marble shade is punctuated with frisian and metallic artworks showing the numbers 1905 and torches (works of Yury Korolev). Grey granite covers the floor.|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{possibility}} to perform HDC in micropillar array columns and the potential advantages of such a system. The HDC performance of a pillar array column with pillar diameter = 5 μm and an <b>interpillar</b> distance of 2. 5 μm has been characterized using both a low MW tracer (FITC) and differently sized polystyrene bead samples (100, 200 and 500 nm). The reduced plate height curves that were obtained for the different investigated markers all overlapped very well, and attained a minimum value of about hmin = 0. 3 (reduction based on the pillar diameter), corresponding to 1. 6 μm in absolute value and giving good prospects for high efficiency separations. The obtained reduced retention time values were in fair agreement with that predicted by the Di Marzio and Guttman model for a flow between flat plates, using the minimal <b>interpillar</b> distance as characteristic interplate distance...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, reverse nonequilibrium {{molecular}} dynamics is employed to study thermal resistance across interfaces comprising dimensionally mismatched junctions of single layer graphene floors with (6, 6) {{single-walled carbon nanotube}} (SWCNT) pillars in 3 D carbon nanomaterials. Results obtained from unit cell analysis indicate the presence of notable interfacial thermal resistance in the out-of-plane direction (along the longitudinal axis of the SWCNTs) but negligible resistance in the in-plane direction along the graphene floor. The interfacial thermal resistance in the out-of-plane direction is understood {{to be due to}} the change in dimensionality as well as phonon spectra mismatch as the phonons propagate from SWCNTs to the graphene sheet and then back again to the SWCNTs. The thermal conductivity of the unit cells was observed to increase nearly linearly with an increase in cell size, that is, pillar height as well as <b>interpillar</b> distance, and approaches a plateau as the pillar height and the <b>interpillar</b> distance approach the critical lengths for ballistic thermal transport in SWCNT and single layer graphene. The results indicate that the thermal transport characteristics of these SWCNT-graphene hybrid structures can be tuned by controlling the SWCNT-graphene junction characteristics as well as the unit cell dimensions...|$|E
40|$|Composite {{adsorbents}} {{of carbon}} and alumina intercalated montmorillonite were prepared and characterized by adsorption of N- 2 and O- 2 at various temperatures. The effects of pyrolysis, temperature, heating rate, subsequent degassing, and doping of cations and anions were investigated. The adsorption capacities of the composite adsorbents developed at higher temperatures (0 and - 79 degrees C) {{are found to}} be larger than those of normal alumina pillared clays. The experimental results showed that the framework of these adsorbents is made of alumina particles and clay sheets while the pyrolyzed carbon distributes in the space of interlayers and <b>interpillars.</b> The pores between the carbon particles, clay sheets, and alumina pillars are very narrow with very strong adsorption forces, leading to enhanced adsorption capacities at 0 and - 79 degrees C. The composite adsorbents exhibit features similar to those of carbonaceous adsorbents. Their pore structures, adsorption capacities, and selectivities to oxygen can be tailored by a controlled degassing procedure. Meanwhile, ions can be doped into the adsorbents to modify their adsorption properties, as usually observed for oxide adsorbents like zeolite and pillared clays. Such flexibility in pore structure tailoring is a potential advantage of the composite adsorbents developed for their adsorption and separation applications. (C) 1999 Academic Press...|$|R
30|$|Despite the {{striking}} {{similarity between the}} natural and synthetic nanostructured surfaces, some variations in bactericidal activity were observed among wings of different dragonfly species [2] and the biomimetic bSi surfaces [1]. In light of these results, {{the aim of the}} current work was to investigate the relationship between the characteristics (nanopillar density, height, and <b>interpillar</b> distance) of the bSi nanopatterned surfaces and their bactericidal efficiencies. These data provide useful insights into way in which the design and fabrication of mechano-responsive antibacterial surfaces can be made more effective.|$|E
40|$|Phase locking {{dynamics}} of dipolarly coupled vortices excited by spin-polarized current in two identical nanopillars is studied {{as a function}} of the <b>interpillar</b> distance L. Numerical study and an analytical model have proved the remarkable efficiency of magnetostatic interaction in achieving phase locking. Investigating the dynamics in the transient regime toward phase locking, we extract the evolution of the locking time τ, the coupling strength μ, and the interaction energy W. Finally, we compare this coupling energy with the one obtained by a simple model...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} analytically and numerically the synchronization {{dynamics of}} dipolarly coupled vortex based Spin-Torque Nano Oscillators (STNO) with different pillar diameters. We identify the critical <b>interpillar</b> distances on which synchronization occurs {{as a function}} of their diameter mismatch. We obtain numerically a phase diagram showing the transition between unsynchronized and synchronized states and compare it to analytical predictions we make using Thiele approach. Our study demonstrates that for relatively small diameters differences the synchronization dynamics can be described qualitatively using Adler equation. However when the diameters difference increases significantly, the system becomes strongly non-Adlerian...|$|E
30|$|Al/Al 2 O 3 core/shell {{nanowires}} and patterned Si nanopillars {{were also}} studied {{to control the}} cellular responses such as cell adhesion, growth and proliferation. Lee et al. patterned periodic structures of Al/Al 2 O 3 core/shell nanowires, and showed that the periodic patterns lead to the alignment of glial cells and dorsal root ganglia axons [64]. Similar to the Al/Al 2 O 3 nanowires experiment, Bucaro et al. showed that Si nanopillars could control the cell polarization and alignment by controlling the radius, height and <b>interpillar</b> spacing of Si nanopillars [65].|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{possibility}} to achieve ultra high efficiencies (order of 1 million theoretical plates) in liquid chromatography {{in a relatively short}} time of 20 min (elution time of unretained marker). This was achieved using a micropillar array column with optimized pillar diameter (5 μm) and <b>interpillar</b> distance (2. 5 μm) to operate close to the Knox and Saleem limit of micropillar array columns in the region of the 1 million theoretical plate mark under the prevailing pressure restriction (350 bar in the present study). The obtained efficiency was slightly affected (some 15 to 20 % around the optimal flow rate) by the turns that were inevitably needed to arrange a 3 m long column on a 4 in. silicon wafer...|$|E
40|$|A surface {{possessing}} a regular array of micro-pillars was evaluated {{with regard to}} its ability to control epithelial downgrowth at the percutaneous interface. A range of pillar sizes were applied to the vertical segment of T shaped Biomer (R) implants. These percutaneous tabs were implanted into the dorsum of cats {{for a period of}} 6 weeks using a standardized surgical technique. Comments were made post-operatively and at the time of retrieval. A quantitative scoring system was applied to these observations as well as histological results. As observed, the pillar morphology used displayed the ability to control epithelial downgrowth. Collagen ingrowth into the <b>interpillar</b> spaces and possibly direct interactions of the epithelial cells with the morphology may account for the inhibition. The reproducibility of epithelial inhibition is, however, limited by other factors which are currently not well understood. These factors and potential methods of assessment are discussed...|$|E
30|$|In summary, we have {{reported}} {{a simple and}} innovative electrochemical approach to fabricate cobalt and nickel nanopillar arrays on aluminium substrates. This technique improves other methods previously proposed, {{because the number of}} stages in the fabrication process is smaller. For this reason, it is faster and more cost-effective than previous works. This advantage is due mainly {{to the fact that the}} removal of aluminium oxide from the pore bottom tips in the NAAM template takes place in the same electrolyte in which the anodization is carried out. Another main feature of this process is that the Co and Ni nanopillars remain on the aluminium substrate after removing the NAAM template. In addition, the technique presented here can be applied to NAAMs produced by both the MA and HA techniques with different acids, which opens a wide range of nanopillar morphologies. The nanopillar diameter and weight and the <b>interpillar</b> distance can be established beforehand by modifying the anodization parameters (anodization voltage, acid and concentration mainly).|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} horizontal incoherence {{between the first and}} second pillar of the European Union in its external relations. Horizontal coherence is an important concept for the European Union’s legitimacy and strength. Internally, coherence is essential for the Union’s democratic legitimacy, as democratic influx comes from the Council. Externally, to the extent incoherent positions result in unfulfilled external policy goals, observing the set of moral duties that legitimize the Union’s right to carry out ‘social good ’ is at stake. Scrutinizing <b>interpillar</b> relations in the EU’s policy implementation process in the field of external relations, the main suggestion of this essay is that incoherence has two sources of origin: one is the institutionalized intra-EU cleavage of competences within the Union’s organizations. The other derives from the theory of organizations, explained consuming Barnett & Finnemore’s bureaucracy theory. The theory proposes that through analyzing international organizations such as the EU as bureaucracies rather than as extensions of states ’ power, we can establish...|$|E
40|$|An industrially {{feasible}} {{process for}} the fast mass-production of molded polymeric micro-patterned substrates is here presented. Microstructured polystyrene (PS) surfaces were obtained through micro injection molding (μIM) technique on directly patterned stamps realized with a new zirconia-based hybrid spin-on system able to withstand 300 cycles at 90 °C. The use of directly patterned stamps entails a great advantage on the overall manufacturing process as it allows a fast, flexible, and simple one-step process {{with respect to the}} use of milling, laser machining, electroforming techniques, or conventional lithographic processes for stamp fabrication. Among the different obtainable geometries, we focused our attention on PS replicas reporting 2, 3, and 4 μm diameter pillars with 8, 9, 10 μm center-to-center distance, respectively. This enabled us to study the effect of the substrate topography on human mesenchymal stem cells behavior without any osteogenic growth factors. Our data show that microtopography affected cell behavior. In particular, calcium deposition and osteocalcin expression enhanced as diameter and <b>interpillar</b> distance size increases, and the 4 - 10 surface was the most effective to induce osteogenic differentiation...|$|E
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{performance}} of electrowetting-based microfluidic devices, we used micropillar structures to enhance {{the changes in the}} wettability of gold electrodes. The changes in the contact angle of a sessile drop were influenced by the diameter of the micropillars and <b>interpillar</b> distances. For a potential change between 0 V and − 1. 0 V, the change of the contact angle of the KCl sessile drop was 41 ° on a smooth electrode, but 88 ° on an electrode with micropillars with a 10 µm diameter. Furthermore, the existence of the micropillars accelerated the change of the contact angle. The gold electrodes with the micropillars were used to generate the capillary force to mobilize a liquid column in a microflow channel. Compared to a device with a smooth electrode, this device showed a fourfold increase in the flow velocity at − 0. 9 V. The electrodes were also used as a valve. The ability to stop an intruding solution and the switching speed was improved with the micropillar structure...|$|E
40|$|A novel design {{approach}} for optimizing {{the shape of}} microfabricated pillar columns for LC is presented. 2 -D flow simulations are performed {{with a focus on}} electrokinetically driven flow, in order to evaluate the performance of the new method. The proposed foil shape is compared with geometrical shapes known from the literature, for various arrangements. It yields a much more uniform velocity field distribution and a decrease in plate height values up to 25 %. In addition to shape optimization, a new method for spatial arrangement of structures is presented. With the aim of conserving the hydrodynamic balance, the axial spacing of the pillars is adjusted according to the proposed equivalent width approach. When compared with a fixed <b>interpillar</b> spacing in all directions, it increases the flow uniformity and results in an 18 % lower plate height. A new direct simulation approach is implemented to model both flow field and retention for solid microfabricated pillar structures in the 2 -D domain. This model, which defines retention as inward/outward fluxes through the wall surfaces as first order reactions, enables monitoring of the time-dependent process and an evaluation of the parameters affecting performance. The meaning of the obtained results in a practical setting, with limitations in photolithography and microfabrication, will be highlighte...|$|E
40|$|Properties of porous silicon {{which are}} {{relevant}} {{for use of}} the material as a stationary phase in liquid chromatography chips, like porosity, pore size and specific surface area, were determined with high-resolution SEM and N 2 adsorption–desorption isotherms. For the anodization conditions investigated, porosity is between 20 and 60 %, pore sizes between 2 and 5 nm and specific surface area between 130 and 410 m 2 /cm 3. It was established that under identical anodization conditions, porous layer formation is 10 – 15 % slower on micromachined pillars than on flat substrates, and depends on geometrical parameters like pillar diameter and height and <b>interpillar</b> spacing. In microchannels containing pillars with a porous silicon shell, chromatographic experiments on a coumarin dye mixture were performed, which in comparison with non-porous pillars showed a significant increase of the retention factors, resulting from the large internal surface of the porous pillars. The increased relative retention of one of the coumarin dyes, C 480, could be correlated quantitatively with the measured internal surface of the porous layer. Due to the small pore size, these porous shell columns are particularly suitable for analytical or preparative separation of low-molecular weight molecules, with applications in metabolomics, food quality control, or medical diagnostics...|$|E
40|$|It is {{possible}} to produce a high-performance, flexible 1 - 3 connectivity piezoelectric ceramic composite with conventional methods but the process is difficult and time-consuming. Extensive finite element modeling was used to design a piezocomposite structure which incorporated randomly positioned piezoceramic fibers in a polymer matrix. Simple manufacturing techniques were developed {{which resulted in the}} production of large numbers of fully populated fiber composites that offered performance comparable with a conventional 1 - 3 piezocomposite. A modified process facilitated the production of efficient fiber piezocomposite elements separated by polymer channels which conformed to a highly flexible (13 mm radius of curvature), 2 -D matrix array configuration. This arrangement has been termed a Composite Element Composite Array Transducer, or CECAT. These devices were evaluated in terms of their impedance spectra, pulse-echo response, and surface displacement characteristics. The random piezoceramic fiber arrangements showed comparable sensitivity and bandwidth to periodic devices while minimizing the parasitic <b>interpillar</b> modes associated with periodic structures. Investigations have indicated that CECAT arrays constructed with 250 mum diameter fibers can be operated at frequencies of up to 3 MHz and transducers incorporating 10 mum diameter fibers can extend the frequency range above 6 MHz. Conversely, improved low-frequency devices can be produced with taller pillars than possible with conventional manufacturing techniques...|$|E

Phys. 131, 244701 (2009) and may be found at [URL] microporous structure of pillared interlayered clays is determined by their interlayer separation {{and the distribution of}} the pillars that separate their layers. The pillars provide stability to these quasi-two-dimensional high surface area materials. In this work we present a topological analysis of available and accessible volumes within various simple models of pillared interlayered clays. Each model is characterized by a distribution of pillars. Both fully ordered structures and disordered pillar distributions with either attractive or repulsive <b>interpillar</b> correlations are considered. Particular attention is paid to the problem of accessibility. In systems with similar degrees of porosity, even when cavities within each model might be able to host the same adsorbate molecules, their accessibility will strongly depend on the pillar distribution.

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on a lecture {{delivered}} during the Academy of European Law Summer School 2006. It provides an examination from a legal perspective of three current themes in the external relations of the European Union. First, the legal implications of the pillar structure for external relations, including recent case law and practical issues arising from the application of Article 47 TEU, the borderline between Community external policies and the Union’s common foreign and security policy, and practical <b>interpillar</b> cooperation. It concludes that it is easier to combine the pillars by means of pragmatic solutions, whereas it is much more difficult {{in the case of a}} strictly legal construction which takes into account the requirements of Union coherence and the separate character of each pillar. Second, the paper turns to the balance between Member States and the European Union/Community in external policy and in particular the application of the “AETR test” in recent case law including the “Open Skies” cases, the Lugano Convention Opinion and the “Mox Plant” case. It concludes that a proper application of the AETR remains a practical challenge that transcends the narrow issue of pure legal deduction as to whether Community competence is “affected” or not. And third, the paper considers the position of the EU within, and participation in the work of, international organisations such as the United Nations, the WHO and the WTO. The paper concludes by emphasising the need for collaboration between the institutions and for pragmatic solutions to the problems that are inevitable while the Union retains its current complex structur...|$|E
40|$|Wafer-scale surface-enhanced Raman {{scattering}} (SERS) substrates fabricated using {{maskless lithography}} {{are important for}} scalable production targets. Large-area, leaning silver-capped silicon nanopillar (Ag NP) structures suitable for SERS molecular detection at extremely low analyte concentrations are investigated. Theoretical results show that isolated Ag NPs essentially support two localized surface plasmon (LSP) modes. The most prominent LSP resonance is observed in the near-infrared region (similar to 800 nm) and can be tuned by changing {{the diameter of the}} silicon nanopillars (Si NPs). The corresponding electric field distribution maps indicate that the maximum E-field enhancement is found at the Ag cavity, i. e., the bottom part of the Ag cap. We argue that the plasmon coupling between the resonant Ag cap cavities contributes most to the enhancement of the Raman signal. We experimentally evaluate these findings and show that by exposing Si NPs to an O- 2 -plasma the average Ag NP cluster size, and thus the overall <b>interpillar</b> coupling, can be systematically reduced. We show that deposition of Cr adhesion layers on Si NPs (> 3 nm) introduces plasmon coupling loss to the Ag NP LSP cavity mode that significantly reduces the SERS intensity. Results also show that short exposures to the O- 2 -plasma and the use of 1 - 3 nm Cr adhesion layers are advantageous for reducing the signal background noise from Ag NPs. In addition, the influence of the Ag NP height and Ag metal thickness on SERS intensities is investigated and optimal fabrication process parameters are evaluated. Finally, the SERS spectrum from 100 pM trans- 1, 2 -bis(4 -pyridyl) ethylene (BPE) is recorded, showing distinct characteristic Raman vibrational modes. The calculated enhancement factor is of the order of 108, and the SERS signal intensity exhibits a standard deviation of around 14 % (660 data points) across a 5 x 5 mm(2) surface area...|$|E
40|$|Microstructured {{interfaces}} such as micropillars made of polydimethyl-siloxane (PDMS) {{provide a}} novel approach both as topologically defined, force sensing substrates in cell culture as well as scaffolds for biomimetic protein assays. This work {{is divided into two}} parts. In the first part, PDMS micropillar arrays functionalized with fibronectin, are applied as a biomechanical microenvironment for immortalized human gingival keratinocytes (IHGKs) and gingival connective-tissue fibroblasts (GCTFs). IHGKs and GCTFs show successful adhesion and growth on the pillar heads and exert forces up to about 110 nN in the case of IHGKs and about 174 nN for GCTFs. Varying the <b>interpillar</b> distances affects the early keratinocyte differentiation and morphology. At decreasing inter-pillar distances the IHGKs show an increased keratin 1 (K 1) extension in the cytoplasm, increased mRNA transcription of keratin 1 and a shape change from a more linear to a more round form. A novel GCTF-IHGK co-culture system is developed as a model of the epithelial tissue, to study explicitly the role of the GCTFs in the morphogenesis of the derived epithelial equivalents. The epithelial equivalents, cultured for 7 and 14 days on GCTF-populated pillar arrays, are found more similar to the in vivo phenotype than the GCTF-free cultures. These findings are confirmed by following the mRNA transcription levels for keratin 1. A novel, transparent microfluidic platform, based on PDMS pillars is developed {{in the second part of}} this work. It is designed to investigate actin cortex models and to provide control over the physicochemical environment, allowing simultaneous high resolution fluorescence microscopy. The formation of crosslinking networks is observed using various crosslinkers, such as filamin, myosin II, alpha-actinin and magnesium ions. Dependent of the geometric configuration of the actin filaments anchored to the pillar tops, so-called zipping crosslinks are observed. The zipping velocity is both influenced by the flow speed, as well as the number and the configuration of the filaments involved in the process. It is found to range between 2 - 15 µm/s. To further quantify the crosslinking process, the flow-cell is combined with an optical tweezers system. The unzipping forces are measured for the crosslinkers alpha-actinin and magnesium ions. Forces of about 17 - 20 pN are derived for magnesium ions and about 30 - 45 pN for alpha-actinin...|$|E
