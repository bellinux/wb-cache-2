5|$|Sabah's {{economy is}} mainly based on primary sector such as agriculture, {{forestry}} and petroleum. Currently, the tertiary sector {{plays an important}} part to the state economy, especially in tourism and services. With its richness in biodiversity, the state is offering ecotourism. Although {{in recent years the}} tourism industry has been affected by attacks and kidnapping of tourists by militant groups based in the southern Philippines, it remained stable with the increase of security in eastern Sabah and the Sulu Sea. The tourism sector contribute 10% share of the state GDP and was predicted to increase more. Majority of the tourists come from China (60.3%), followed by South Korea (33.9%), Australia (16.3%) and Taiwan (8.3%). Since the 1950s, rubber and copra are the main source of agricultural economy of North Borneo. The timber industry start to emerged in the 1960s due to high demand of raw materials from industrial countries. This was however replaced by petroleum in the 1970s after the discovery of oil in the area of west coast Sabah. In the same year, cocoa and palm oil was added to the list. The Sabah state government managed to increase the state fund from RM6million to RM12billion and poverty was down by almost half to 33.1% in 1980. The state rapid development on primary sector has attracted those job seekers in neighbouring Indonesia and the Philippines as the state labour force itself are not sufficient. The state Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at the time ranked behind Selangor and Kuala Lumpur, being the third richest although the manufacturing sector remained small. However, by 2000, the state started to become the poorest as it still dependent on natural resources as its primary sources of income comparing to those secondary sector producer states. Thus the Sabah <b>Development</b> <b>Corridor</b> (SDC) was established in 2008 by Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi with a total investment of RM105billion for 18 years to increase the state GDP to RM63.2billion by 2025. Around RM5.83billion were allocated each year for infrastructures development along with the creation of 900,000 jobs. The federal government targeted to eradicate hardcore poverty by the end Ninth Malaysia Plan (9MP) with overall poverty halved from 23% in 2004 to 12% in 2010 and 8.1% in 2012. Since its establishment in 2008, the state GDP increase to 10.7% which was higher than the national economic growth of 4.8% and the world economic growth of 2.7%. Following the world financial crisis in 2009, Sabah GDP recorded 4.8% growth compared to −1.5% for national level and −0.4% for world level.|$|E

25|$|A broad genetic {{sampling}} of 95 wild Russian tigers found markedly low genetic diversity, with the effective population size extraordinarily low {{in comparison to}} the census population size, with the population behaving as if it were just 27–35 individuals. Further exacerbating the problem is that more than 90% of the population occurs in the Sikhote Alin mountain region, and there is little movement of tigers across the <b>development</b> <b>corridor,</b> which separates this sub-population from the much smaller sub-population found in southwest Primorye province.|$|E

25|$|Samples of 95 wild Amur tigers were {{collected}} throughout their native range to investigate questions relative to population genetic structure and demographic history. Additionally, targeted {{individuals from the}} North American ex situ population were sampled to assess the genetic representation found in captivity. Population genetic and Bayesian structure analyses clearly identified two populations separated by a <b>development</b> <b>corridor</b> in Russia. Despite their well-documented 20th century decline, the researchers failed to find evidence of a recent population bottleneck, although genetic signatures of a historical contraction were detected. This disparity in signal {{may be due to}} several reasons, including historical paucity in population genetic variation associated with postglacial colonization and potential gene flow from a now extirpated Chinese population. The extent and distribution of genetic variation in captive and wild populations were similar, yet gene variants persisted ex situ that were lost in situ. Overall, their results indicate the need to secure ecological connectivity between the two Russian populations to minimize loss of genetic diversity and overall susceptibility to stochastic events, and support a previous study suggesting that the captive population may be a reservoir of gene variants lost in situ.|$|E

40|$|By {{introducing}} public transport-oriented <b>corridor</b> <b>development</b> {{to scientific}} urban planning literature, {{the present paper}} aims at identifying and prioritizing <b>development</b> <b>corridors</b> of Melbourne metropolitan region according to corridor model of GIS software. To this purpose, six variables were employed; population density in 2011, main commercial centers (17 centers), metro-based transport network, tramway, freeways and main arterial highways. The resulted mapping layers were converted from vector to raster based on access radius of 400 and 800 m buffers from connection lines. Considering different natures of variables, they were weighted by the option Reclassify of Arc. Gis software. Then using the option Cost-Distance, required layers were formed and finally three mapping corridor models were obtained by combining six variables using corridor model. Finally a new map was drawn indicating hybrid and the most accessible corridors by combining three corridor maps and called hybrid corridor map. This corridor map is suggested as the best model for development of Melbourne metropolitan region. Key words: <b>corridor</b> <b>development,</b> Melbourne metropolitan region, prioritizatio...|$|R
