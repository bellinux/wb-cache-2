5|$|Calvin's first {{published}} work was a commentary of Seneca the Younger's De Clementia. Published {{at his own}} expense in 1532, <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> he was a humanist {{in the tradition of}} Erasmus with a thorough understanding of classical scholarship. His first theological work, the Psychopannychia, attempted to refute the doctrine of soul sleep as promulgated by the Anabaptists. Calvin probably wrote it during the period following Cop's speech, but it was not published until 1542 in Strasbourg.|$|E
5|$|Ideas {{about the}} nature of law in general were {{beginning}} to change. In 1716, the Septennial Act was passed, which had a number of consequences. First, <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> Parliament no longer considered its previous statutes unassailable, as it provided for a maximum parliamentary term of seven years, whereas the Triennial Act (1694) (enacted {{less than a quarter of}} a century previously) had provided for a maximum term of three years.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, recent studies show an {{increasingly}} positive attitude {{of patients and}} physicians (M.D. and D.O.) towards the use of manual therapy as a valid, safe and effective treatment modality. One survey, published in the Journal of Continuing Medical Education, found {{that a majority of}} physicians (81%) and patients (76%) felt that manual manipulation (MM) was safe, and over half (56% of physicians and 59% of patients) felt that manipulation should be available in the primary care setting. Although less than half (40%) of the physicians reported any educational exposure to MM and less than one-quarter (20%) have administered MM in their practice, most (71%) respondents endorsed desiring more instruction in MM. Another small study examined the interest and ability of M.D. residents in learning osteopathic principles and skills, including OMT. <b>It</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> after a 1-month elective rotation, the M.D. residents responded favorably to the experience.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the implications of}} complementarity in private production and constraints on government for optimal fiscal policy. Using an endogenous growth model with public finance, it derives three central results which modify findings in the literature under standard assumptions. First, <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> optimal public spending composition and taxation are interrelated so that first- and second-best 8 ̆ 5 fiscal policies differ. Second, <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> the growth-maximizing fiscal policy is affected by preference parameters. Third, <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> with budget rigidities and informational limitations, knowledge about the optimal fiscal policy parameter values is not necessary for growth-enhancing fiscal policy adjustments...|$|R
5|$|Bigfin reef squids and {{the common}} octopus (Octopus vulgaris) were studied to resolve a century-long debate over whether {{cephalopods}} can hear. Unlike fishes, cephalopods do not possess air-filled swim bladders, which might amplify sound waves travelling in water. The results were published in 2009. <b>It</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> bigfin reef squids and octopuses utilise their statocysts for detecting vibrations, an organ primarily used for maintaining spatial orientation. The common octopus can hear sounds between 400Hz and 1000Hz. Bigfin reef squids have a slightly better hearing range of 400Hz to 1500Hz. Both hear best at a frequency of 600Hz. Relatively, their hearing is comparable to prawns and some other invertebrates but is less sensitive than that of most fishes.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, an Australian ant allergy venom {{study was}} conducted, {{with the goal}} of {{determining}} which native Australian ants were associated with ant sting anaphylaxis. <b>It</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> the jack jumper ant was responsible for the majority of patients' reactions to Myrmecia ant stings. Of the 265 patients who reacted to a sting from an ant belonging to the Myrmecia genus, 176 were from the jack jumper. 15 from M. nigrocincta and three from M. ludlowi, while 56 patients had reacted to other Myrmecia ants. The study concluded that four native species of Australian ants caused anaphylaxis. Apart from Myrmecia species, the green-head ant (Rhytidoponera metallica) was also responsible for several systemic reactions.|$|E
5|$|During {{her time}} at Missouri, McClintock {{expanded}} her {{research on the}} effect of X-rays on maize cytogenetics. McClintock observed the breakage and fusion of chromosomes in irradiated maize cells. She was also able to show that, in some plants, spontaneous chromosome breakage occurred in the cells of the endosperm. Over the course of mitosis, she observed that the ends of broken chromatids were rejoined after the chromosome replication. In the anaphase of mitosis, the broken chromosomes formed a chromatid bridge, which was broken when the chromatids moved towards the cell poles. The broken ends were rejoined in the interphase of the next mitosis, and the cycle was repeated, causing massive mutation, which she could detect as variegation in the endosperm. This breakage–rejoining–bridge cycle was a key cytogenetic discovery for several reasons. First, <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> the rejoining of chromosomes was not a random event, and second, it demonstrated a source of large-scale mutation. For this reason, it remains an area of interest in cancer research today.|$|E

5|$|Precautions {{were taken}} to prevent secrets from the season finale being revealed; only certain staff members were {{provided}} with copies of the episode, which were given on watermarked DVDs and distributed to secret hiding places.

The first scene with Michael and Holly discussing their sketch possibilities in a secluded area was filmed with three cameras: one focusing on each side of the two actors, and one from the front of both of them to establish that the picnic was still going on behind them. Due to space limitations, the latter angle was filmed through a mirror (with the actors appearing to be opposite sides) and then the image was reversed and undistorted in post-production.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the toxic effects information came from a study conducted between 1 April 2005 to 1 September 2005. The study recorded all presentations associated with party pill use at the Emergency Department of Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand by recording them on a prospective data collection form. The aim was to study the patterns of human toxicity related {{to the use of}} benzylpiperazine-based 'party pills'. 61 patients presented on 80 occasions. Patients with mild to moderate toxicity experienced symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, dystonia and urinary retention. Significantly, fourteen toxic seizures were recorded with two patients suffering life-threatening toxicity with status epilepticus and severe respiratory and metabolic acidosis. It was concluded that BZP appears to induce toxic seizures in neurologically normal subjects. The results of this study and others like <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> BZP can cause unpredictable and serious toxicity in some individuals, but the data and dosage collection were reliant on self reporting by drug users, which may result in under-reporting (or over-reporting), and there were complicating factors like the frequent presence of alcohol and other drugs.|$|E
