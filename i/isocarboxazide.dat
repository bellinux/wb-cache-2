40|$|The {{generalized}} Shwartzman reaction (GSR) {{was produced}} by a single injection of endotoxin in male rats pretreated with catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors (tropolone, pyrogallol). Such a result was not obtained with inhibitors (pargyline, phenelzine, <b>isocarboxazide)</b> of the monoamine oxidase (MAO). The inhibitors of the COMT were found to enhance the action of endotoxin on the coagulation system such {{as evidenced by the}} increased consumptions of Hageman factor, fibrinogen, and platelets. Tropolone-treated rabbits did not require exogenous stimulation of alpha-adrenergic receptor sites by norepinephrine to localize thrombi in the glomerular capillaries when Hageman factor was activated by ellagic acid and fibrinolysis inhibited by epsilon-amino-caproic acid. It is concluded that interference with the degradation of circulating catecholamines results in sensitization to the generalized Shwartzman reaction...|$|E
