500|$|For the {{character}} of Giselle, her journey to becoming a real woman is reflected in her dresses, which become less fairy tale-like as the film progresses. Her wedding dress {{at the beginning of}} the film directly contrasts her modern gown at the end of the film. The wedding dress served to provide a [...] "humongous contrast to the flat drawings" [...] and to accentuate the image of a Disney Princess. In order to make the waist look small, the sleeves are designed to be [...] "extremely pouffy" [...] and the skirt to be as big as possible, which included a metal hoop that holds up 20 layers of petticoats and ruffles. Altogether, eleven versions of the dress are made for filming, each made of 200 yards (183 m) of silk satin and other fabric, and weighing approximately 40 pounds (18kg). On the experience of wearing the wedding dress, Amy Adams described it as [...] "grueling" [...] since [...] "the entire weight was on her hips, so occasionally it <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in traction".|$|E

Mrs. Ciccone, at a loss to explain her dire medical condition, would often begin to cry when questioned by Madonna, at which point Madonna would respond by wrapping her arms around her mother tenderly. [...] "I remember feeling stronger than she was", Madonna recalled, [...] "I was so little and yet I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> the child." [...] Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying. [...] "There was so much left unsaid, so many untangled and unresolved emotions, of remorse, guilt, loss, anger, confusion.... I saw my mother, looking very beautiful and lying as if she were asleep in an open casket. Then I noticed that my mother's mouth looked funny. It took me some time to realize that it had been sewn up. In that awful moment, I began to understand what I had lost forever.

They praised each of the [...] "superb" [...] guest actors, particularly Harry Enfield, David Baddiel and Sally Phillips, who she thought played Angela [...] "brilliantly". Digital Spy's Neil Wilkes gave the episode a positive review, describing it as [...] "probably the most outrageous of the series to date". He wrote that the tension between Effy and Freddie [...] "set things up nicely" [...] for the following episode, which focused on Freddie. The entertainment editor for eurOut.org, a website for European lesbians, thought that the episode included [...] "a lot of confusing straight relationship drama" [...] and <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> [...] "stuck in high school hell". She wrote, however, that the brownie-making scene was [...] "so ridiculous it's kind of funny" [...] and likened Skins to [...] "Gossip Girl on crack". Jason Hughes of TV Squad felt that within the ensemble cast [...] "most of these kids were so unlikable", though he attributed this to the series [...] "show us their weaknesses". He found Pandora to be more likable, however, believing that her innocence was [...] "more representative of youth than most of the other characters".

It might be something to do with being confronted by a physically charismatic very tall woman, or maybe it's that she's caught the impressiveness of the character of that woman, that soldier. She's also an extraordinarily hilarious woman. We had great fun together. It was great fun to play." [...] Gwendoline Christie also spoke about filming with Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who portrays Jaime Lannister, again, saying [...] "I was excited, It was really fun to be with Nikolaj again, and I thought the way of which their reunion happens is not really expected. I just loved that it was so formal, because within the confines of such formality, and having to negotiate with each other, there are so many other stories begging to be told in those moments. There's a slow process of creeping familiarity among two people who haven't been together for a long time; it was allowed to build." [...] Coster-Waldau also spoke about their first reunion scene, stating [...] "It's a great scene. These characters are so much about holding their cards so close to their chest and they don't want to reveal how they're feeling. But we know there's history between them, that this is more than two knights meeting. But they would never acknowledge that." ...|$|E

[...] "Those tracks were like a different era for me, and I didn't want people to perceive it like I'm just trying {{to capitalize on the}} same thing.
