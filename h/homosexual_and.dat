5|$|In his {{personal}} life, Chapman was openly <b>homosexual</b> <b>and</b> {{a strong supporter}} of gay rights, and was in a relationship with David Sherlock. He was an alcoholic during his time at Cambridge and the Python years, quitting shortly before working on Life of Brian. Chapman died of tonsil and spinal cancer on 4 October 1989, on the eve of Monty Python's 20th anniversary, and his life and legacy were commemorated at a private memorial service at St Bartholomew's with the other five Pythons.|$|E

5|$|Lack of {{differentiation}} between <b>homosexual</b> <b>and</b> heterosexual women in medical studies that concentrate on health issues for women skews results for lesbians and non-lesbian women. Reports are inconclusive about occurrence {{of breast cancer}} in lesbians. It has been determined, however, that the lower rate of lesbians tested by regular Pap smears {{makes it more difficult}} to detect cervical cancer at early stages in lesbians. The risk factors for developing ovarian cancer rates are higher in lesbians than heterosexual women, perhaps because many lesbians lack protective factors of pregnancy, abortion, contraceptives, breast feeding, and miscarriages.|$|E
5|$|Sexuality {{played an}} {{important}} role in Crowley's ideas about magick and his practice of it, and has been described as being central to Thelema. He outlined three forms of sex magick—the autoerotic, <b>homosexual,</b> <b>and</b> heterosexual—and argued that such acts could be used to focus the magician's will onto a specific goal such as financial gain or personal creative success. For Crowley, sex was treated as a sacrament, with the consumption of sexual fluids interpreted as a Eucharist. This was often manifested as the Cakes of Light, a biscuit containing either menstrual blood or a mixture of semen and vaginal fluids. The Gnostic Mass is the central religious ceremony within Thelema.|$|E
5|$|Sorabji was <b>homosexual,</b> <b>and</b> in {{the early}} 1920s he {{consulted}} Havelock Ellis, a British psychologist and writer on sexual psychology, about it. Ellis held progressive views on the subject, and Sorabji expressed high admiration for him, dedicating his Piano Concerto No. 7, Simorg-Anka (1924), to him {{as an expression of}} gratitude. Although Sorabji experienced racial harassment in his youth, his homosexuality caused him greater trouble; he wrote to Holliday that he had once been blackmailed over it.|$|E

5|$|The Latin American lesbian {{movement}} {{has been the most}} active in Mexico, but has encountered similar problems in effectiveness and cohesion. While groups try to promote lesbian issues and concerns, they also face misogynistic attitudes from gay men and homophobic views from heterosexual women. In 1977, Lesbos, the first lesbian organization for Mexicans, was formed. Several incarnations of political groups promoting lesbian issues have evolved; 13 lesbian organizations were active in Mexico City in 1997. Ultimately, however, lesbian associations have had little influence both on the <b>homosexual</b> <b>and</b> feminist movements.|$|E
5|$|Todd is briefly {{questioned}} {{about his relationship}} with Dussander, but he manages to convince the police that he knew nothing of the old man's true identity. At the hospital, Dussander hears a group of Neo-Nazis demonstrating outside the hospital; realizing his identity has been hopelessly compromised, he commits suicide by giving himself an air embolism. When French learns that the man who met Todd at school was not Todd's grandfather but a war criminal, he confronts Todd, who then blackmails him into silence by threatening to accuse him of making inappropriate sexual advances towards him, and to thereby expose him publicly as a <b>homosexual</b> <b>and</b> pederast.|$|E
5|$|Torchwood is a British {{science fiction}} drama {{television}} programme, {{part of the}} long-running Doctor Who franchise, which began airing in 2006 on BBC Three. The series explores several themes in its narrative, in particular LGBT themes. Various characters are portrayed as sexually fluid; through those characters, the series examines <b>homosexual</b> <b>and</b> bisexual relationships. Although {{the nature of their}} sexual flexibility is not explicitly discussed, the characters offer varying perspectives on orientation, with The Sun describing all of the characters on Torchwood as bisexual.|$|E

5|$|Homophile organizations—as {{homosexual}} {{groups were}} called—grew {{in number and}} spread to the East Coast. Gradually, members of these organizations grew bolder. Frank Kameny founded the Mattachine of Washington, D.C. He had been fired from the U.S. Army Map Service for being a <b>homosexual,</b> <b>and</b> sued unsuccessfully to be reinstated. Kameny wrote that homosexuals were no different from heterosexuals, often aiming his efforts at mental health professionals, some of whom attended Mattachine and DOB meetings telling members they were abnormal. In 1965, Kameny, inspired by the Civil Rights Movement, organized a picket of the White House and other government buildings to protest employment discrimination. The pickets shocked many gay people, and upset some of the leadership of Mattachine and the DOB. At the same time, demonstrations in the Civil Rights Movement and opposition to the Vietnam War all grew in prominence, frequency, and severity throughout the 1960s, as did their confrontations with police forces.|$|E

While heterosexual, <b>homosexual</b> <b>and</b> bisexual men have been found to exhibit similar patterns of hearing, there was a notable differential within a sub-group of males identified as hyperfeminized homosexual males who exhibited test results similar to heterosexual women.|$|E
