5000|$|The {{ribosome}} is {{a complex}} molecular machine that, in order to synthesize proteins during the translation process, has to decode mRNAs by pairing their codons with matching tRNAs. Decoding is {{a major determinant of}} fitness and requires accurate and <b>fast</b> <b>selection</b> of correct tRNAs among many similar competitors. One must have in mind that most binding events are by non-matching (“non-cognate”) tRNAs and the ribosome needs to reject those as fast as possible in order to vacate the binding site. At the same time, the ribosome should keep the matching tRNAs bound enough time to allow the protein synthesis process ensue. Despite the importance of tRNA decoding, it was unclear until recently whether the modern ribosome, and in particular its large conformational changes during decoding, are the outcome of adaptation to its task as a decoder or the result of other constraints.

40|$|Abstract—If {{large amount}} of small cells, i. e., femtocells, picocells or microcells, is deployed, users perform {{handover}} among small cells and macrocells very often. In OFDMA networks, only hard handover is usually supported as this type can be implemented easily. On the other hand, frequent hard handover negatively influence a quality of service experienced by users. The degradation of the quality {{is a consequence of}} a short interruption in communication during hard handover and due to redundant overhead generated for controlling and managing the handover procedure. This paper investigates performance of a <b>fast</b> cell <b>selection</b> applied in two-tier networks with small cells and compares it with the hard handover. We focus on the impact of a backhaul capacity limitation on the performance of both hard handover and <b>fast</b> cell <b>selection.</b> As our results indicate, there is a gain in throughput introduced by the <b>fast</b> cell <b>selection</b> if the backhaul of the small cells is not a bottleneck in term of capacity. Nevertheless, if the backhaul capacity is limited, the <b>fast</b> cell <b>selection</b> is profitable only for low bitrates. This observation indicates a need for mandatory consideration of the backhaul capacity for the <b>fast</b> cell <b>selection</b> in the networks with small cells.

The {{purpose was}} to {{evaluate}} if playing a musical selection without a metronome would affect the heart rates and rate of perceived exertion for drum corps percussionists. Heart rate and RPE values were collected from 11 battery and 12 front ensemble members from one drum corps. The music consisted of two portions of the show at different tempos of 96 and 176 beats per minute. The music was performed at 2 ̆ 2 standstill 2 ̆ 2 with the battery members lined up behind the front ensemble marching, but not moving around or carrying their instruments. The participants performed each show tempo, with and without a metronome—three times with a one-minute rest period between each rep.

30|$|This paper {{studies the}} delay {{reduction}} problem for instantly decodable network coding (IDNC)-based device-to-device (D 2 D) communication-enabled networks. Unlike conventional point-to-multipoint (PMP) systems {{in which the}} wireless base station has the sufficient computation abilities, D 2 D networks rely on battery-powered operations of the devices. Therefore, a particular emphasis on the computation complexity {{needs to be addressed}} in the design of delay reduction algorithms for D 2 D networks. While most of the existing literature on IDNC directly extend the delay reduction PMP schemes, known to be NP-hard, to the D 2 D setting, this paper proposes to investigate and minimize the complexity of such algorithms for battery-powered devices. With delay minimization problems in IDNC-based systems being equivalent to a maximum weight clique problems in the IDNC graph, the presented algorithms, in this paper, can be applied to different delay aspects. This paper introduces and focuses on the reduction of the maximum value of the decoding delay as it represents the most general solution. The complexity of the solution is reduced by first proposing efficient methods for the construction, the update, and the dimension reduction of the IDNC graph. The paper, further, shows that, under particular scenarios, the problem boils down to a maximum clique problem. Due to the complexity of discovering such maximum clique, the paper presents a <b>fast</b> <b>selection</b> algorithm. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the proposed schemes and suggest that the proposed <b>fast</b> <b>selection</b> algorithm provides appreciable complexity gain as compared to the optimal selection one, with a negligible degradation in performance. In addition, they indicate that the running time of the proposed solution is close to the random selection algorithm.|$|E
