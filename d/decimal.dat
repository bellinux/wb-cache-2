Then standard Cauchy sequences are introduced whose Cauchy limits well-define the nonterminating <b>decimals.</b> Cauchy convergence induces the Cauchy norm and {{the closure of the}} terminating <b>decimals</b> in the Cauchy norm is the space of nonterminating <b>decimals</b> and the continuum d∗ that glues together the <b>decimals</b> into the continuum R∗ which is non-Archimedean and non-Hausdorff. The <b>decimals</b> form a countably infinite, hence, discrete subspace of R∗ that is both Archimedean and Hausdorff...|$|R
