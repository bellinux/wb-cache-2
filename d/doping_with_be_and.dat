40|$|We {{have used}} the {{molecular}} beam growth technique which we call “cleaved edge overgrowth” to fabricate quantum wire lasers, in which 1 D quantum confinement is entirely defined by the growth process. The active region of our lasers consists of atomically precise quantum wires that form at the T-shaped intersections of 7 nm wide GaAs quantum wells grown along the [001] crystal axis and after an in situ cleave along the [110] crystal axis. The origin of the quantum mechanical bound state is the relaxation of quantum well confinement at this intersection. The high degree of structural perfection achievable in this way allows the observation of stimulated optical emission from the lowest exciton state in optically {{as well as in}} electrically pumped devices. The formation of a linear p-n junction in which the quantum wires are embedded is achieved by <b>doping</b> <b>with</b> <b>Be</b> <b>and</b> Si in the two orthogonal growth directions.

Strong evidence for the fully gapped nature of the superconducting state has come from field dependent thermal conductivity results on BaNi 2 As 2.

40|$|We {{show that}} {{coherent}} {{control of the}} steady-state long-distance entanglement between pairs of cavity-atom systems {{in an array of}} lossy and driven coupled resonators is possible. The cavities <b>are</b> <b>doped</b> <b>with</b> atoms <b>and</b> <b>are</b> connected through wave guides, other cavities or fibers depending on the implementation. We find that the steady-state entanglement can be coherently controlled through the tuning of the phase difference between the driving fields. It can also be surprisingly high in spite of the pumps being classical fields. For some implementations where the connecting element can be a fiber, long-distance steady state quantum correlations can be established. Furthermore, the maximal of entanglement for any pair is achieved when their corresponding direct coupling is much smaller than their individual couplings to the third party. This effect is reminiscent of the establishment of coherence between otherwise uncoupled atomic levels using classical coherent fields. We suggest a method to measure this entanglement by analyzing the correlations of the emitted photons from the array and also analyze the above results for a range of values of the system parameters, different network geometries and possible implementation technologies.

40|$|A new high-k {{dielectric}} material, i. e., zirconium-doped tantalum oxide (Zr-doped TaOx), in {{the form}} of a sputter-deposited thin film with a thickness range of 5 - 100 nm, has been studied. Important applications of this new dielectric material include the gate dielectric layer for the next generation metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET). Due to the aggressive device scaling in ultra-large-scale integrated circuitry (ULSI), the ultra-thin conventional gate oxide (SiO 2) is unacceptable for many practical reasons. By replacing the SiO 2 layer with a high dielectric constant material (high-k), many of the problems can be solved. In this study, a novel high-k dielectric thin film, i. e., TaOx <b>doped</b> <b>with</b> Zr, <b>was</b> deposited <b>and</b> studied. The film?s electrical, chemical, <b>and</b> structural properties <b>were</b> investigated experimentally.

40|$|In this work, a {{reproducible}} {{fabrication process}} for contacting single GaAs nanowires (NWs) using {{electron beam lithography}} (EBL) has been established. Wurtzite (WZ) GaAs core NWs <b>doped</b> <b>with</b> Te <b>and</b> <b>Be</b> have then <b>been</b> investigated along <b>with</b> intrinsic NWs using photocurrent spectroscopy techniques. It is found that shifts of the fabricated metal contacts are minimized by consistent use of alignment positions and that thick resist introduces contrast issues for small alignment features during EBL. Thick resist further introduces metal shadowing effects during metal deposition. Different surface treatments for removing contaminants and native oxide from the NW surface have been tested to obtain ohmic contacts to the GaAs NWs. Photocurrent wavelength (WL) dependence measurements on intrinsic core NWs show a sharp change near the zink blende (ZB) GaAs band gap, and no free exciton peak is observed at low temperatures. ZB stacking faults in the NWs are believed to cause shifts from the real WZ band gap. Doped core NWs show an intrinsic-like I-V and WL dependence behavior, indicating that dopants are not electrically active. This observation, {{and the absence of}} a free exciton peak, is attributed to the high surface state density of GaAs. I-V characterization on intrinsic and doped NWs shows that ohmic contact is not achieved using the tested surface treatments. Preliminary studies on etching AlGaAs shells of GaAs/AlGaAs core-shell NWs show that 50 : 1 citric acid/hydrogen peroxide solution is a good etchant candidate for future studies using AlGaAs passivated intrinsic and doped GaAs NWs...|$|R
40|$|We review {{theoretical}} {{investigations of}} high-temperature superconductors {{which have been}} performed by density functional theory. The main subject of our study is the Hg-based family of the superconducting cuprates, which demonstrates unusual and still puzzling properties. We show that the first-principles approach is able to describe the effects of chemical doping and pressure on the structural properties, the band structure, the ion charges, and the chemical bonds. We report {{on the origin of}} the optimal doping and present results on the inhomegeneity of the charge distribution and the concomitant splitting of the electronic bands and their contributions to the density of states. Due to their individual energy dependence, the role of the intrinsic inhomogeneities for superconductivity strongly depends on the energy and character of the quasiparticle mediating the Cooper pairing. The evolution of the electric field gradients <b>with</b> <b>doping</b> <b>is</b> analyzed <b>and</b> compared to nuclear resonance experiments. The calculated results can explain the origin of doping-induced effects observed either by local or macroscopic experimental probes. From a systematic study of the density of states by varying the doping concentration as well as applying pressure up to 15 GPa, and comparison with the measured critical temperatures, the coupling constant of the quasiparticle has been estimated to be of the order of one. Moreover, we show how density functional theory allows for the calculation of vibrational properties and phonon Raman scattering in the high-Tc cuprates.
