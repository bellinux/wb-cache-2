The product ions (alpha particles {{in the case of}} a <b>deuterium-tritium</b> <b>plasma)</b> carry a considerable amount of free energy and can therefore drive new plasma instabilities. JACKSON (1986) considered as a preliminary example the propagation of a sound wave through a self-sustaining unmagnetized fusion plasma and showed that such a wave would be thermally unstable. At the peaks of the pressure wave the fusion energy production is enhanced due to the increased density and temperature (the converse being true at the pressure troughs), and this leads to amplification of the wave. A corresponding dispersion relation was derived from a simple fluid model. However, although increased alpha production occurs at the peaks of the wave, the very high energy of the alphas means they have very low collisionality. The increased pressure of th...|$|E

40|$|A burning <b>Deuterium-Tritium</b> <b>plasma</b> is {{one which}} depends upon fusion-produced alpha {{particles}} for self-heating. Whether a plasma can reach a burning state requires {{knowledge of the}} transport of alpha particles, and turbulence is one such source of transport. The alpha particle distribution in collisional equilibrium forms a non-Maxwellian tail which spans orders of magnitude in energy, {{and it is this}} tail that is responsible for heating the plasma. Newly-born high-energy alpha particles are not expected to respond to turbulence as strongly as alpha particles that have slowed down to the bulk plasma temperature. This dissertation presents a low-collisionality derivation of gyrokinetics relevant for alpha particles and describes the upgrades made to the GS 2 flux-tube code to handle general non-Maxwellian energy distributions. With the ability to run self-consistent simulations with a population of alpha particles, we can examine certain assumptions commonly made about alpha particles in the context of microturbulence. It is found that microturbulence can compete with collisional slowing-down, altering the distribution further. One assumption that holds well in electrostatic turbulence is the trace approximation, which is built upon to develop a model for efficiently calculating the coupled radial-energy turbulent transport of a non-Maxwellian species. A new code was written for this purpose and corrections to the global alpha particle heating profile due to microturbulence in an ITER-like scenario are presented along with sensitivity studies...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{next step}} toward fusion as a {{practical}} energy source is the design and construction of ITER. ITER relies in part on ion-cyclotron radio frequency (ICRF) power to heat the <b>deuterium-tritium</b> <b>plasma</b> to fusion temperatures {{as well as to}} provide a portion of the current during flat-top operations. Lower hybrid (LH) RF power is under consideration as an upgrade to the baseline heating and current drive system in order to provide control over the current profile and additional current during start up. We have applied a suite of mature radio frequency (rf) full wave codes using self-consistent particle distributions from a Fokker-Planck code to ITER ICRF scenarios and ITER relevant LH experiments on Alcator C-Mod. We will present three dimensional fullwave simulations showing that the ICRF waves propagate radially inward in ITER with strong central focusing and little toroidal spreading. Fokker-Planck coupled rf simulations show that because of the high plasma density, energetic ion tail formation in ITER is typically weak, {{with the exception of the}} minority deuterium heating scheme where strong tails can develop on the minority ion distribution. Absorption by the fast alpha particles can approach five to ten percent of the injected power.
