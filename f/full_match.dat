40|$|Among {{matching}} {{techniques for}} observational studies, <b>full</b> <b>matching</b> is in principle the best, {{in the sense}} that its alignment of comparable treated and control subjects is as good as that of any alternate method, and potentially much better. This article evaluates the practical performance of <b>full</b> <b>matching</b> for the first time, modifying it in order to minimize variance as well as bias and then using it to compare coached and uncoached takers of the SAT. In this new version, with restrictions on the ratio of treated subjects to controls within <b>matched</b> sets, <b>full</b> <b>matching</b> makes use of many more observations than does pair matching, but achieves far closer matches than does matching with k ≥ 2 controls. Prior to matching, the coached and uncoached groups are separated on the propensity score by 1. 1 SDs. <b>Full</b> <b>matching</b> reduces this separation to 1 % or 2 % of an SD. In older literature comparing matching and regression, Cochran expressed doubts that any method of adjustment could substantially reduce observed bias of this magnitude. To accommodate missing data, regression-based analyses by ETS researchers rejected a subset of the available sample that differed significantly from the subsample they analyzed. <b>Full</b> <b>matching</b> on the propensity score handles the same problem simply and without rejecting observations. In addition, it eases the detection and handling of nonconstancy of treatment effects, which the regression-based analyses had obscured, and it makes fuller use of covariate information. It estimates a somewhat larger effect of coaching on the math score than did ETS’s methods...|$|R

The {{purpose of the study}} was to assess potential selection bias using one-to-one greedy <b>matching</b> versus optimal <b>full</b> <b>matching</b> as part of an evaluation of supportive housing in New York City (NYC). Study Design and Settings Data came from administrative data for 2 groups of applicants who were eligible for an NYC supportive housing program in 2007 – 09, including chronically homeless adults with a substance use disorder and young adults aging out of foster care. We evaluated the 2 matching methods in their ability to balance covariates and represent the original population, and in how those methods affected outcomes related to Medicaid expenditures. Results In the population with a substance use disorder, only optimal <b>full</b> <b>matching</b> performed well in balancing covariates, whereas both methods created representative populations.

40|$|In {{observational}} studies, treated {{subjects and}} controls are often matched to remove bias in pre-treatment covariates. In fixed matching, each treated subject is matched to a fixed number of controls. In variable matching, {{the number of}} controls may vary. In <b>full</b> <b>matching,</b> a single control may also be matched to several treated subjects. ^ In this dissertation, the optimal form of variable matching is determined. Variable matching may achieve substantially greater bias reduction than optimal fixed matching, even with {{the same number of}} controls. In certain cases, variable matching may remove 90 % of the bias while optimal <b>full</b> <b>matching</b> can only remove 50 %. In the population, or in large samples, <b>full</b> <b>matching</b> removes 100 % of the bias, and variable matching removes more bias than fixed matching. If the matching covariate is categorical, zero bias may be possible for finite sample, and full matchings with certain matching patterns are determined to yield the minimum variance estimate of the treatment effect. ^ In a matching with variable set sizes, a weighted estimate of the average treatment effect is needed. One choice of weights is unbiased, but another choice has smaller variance when the effect is constant, not varying from one set to another. A simple test for constant effect is proposed, along with a confidence interval, so the choice of weight may be informed by the available data. ^ Matching with variable set sizes has substantially greater potential in removing pre-treatment bias in observational studies. In many studies, the common practice of matching with a fixed number of controls should be avoided, and appropriate variable <b>matching</b> or <b>full</b> <b>matching</b> may be employed to obtain treatment effect estimates with smaller bias. ...|$|R
