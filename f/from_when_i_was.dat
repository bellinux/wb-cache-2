500|$|Gallagher {{has spoken}} about his {{political}} views on several occasions, most notably {{when he visited}} Tony Blair at No. 10 Downing Street in 1997. In an interview in 1997 {{when he was asked}} about why he visited Blair he replied, [...] "I've taken a lot of flack for going to No. 10 Downing Street but the thing about that is, I never considered myself a rebel anyway. I wasn't going there representing the 'Indie community'. I wasn't representing anyone. I was going there for me. You have to understand that from when I went to school and <b>from</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> born all we ever knew was conservative, Tory, right-wing government. What people don't mention is, they say 'He went to meet Tony Blair.' No. I went to meet the Labour prime minister. Our parents always drummed into us that the Labour Party was for the people and the Tory Party was not. I went to meet the Labour prime minister." ...|$|E

His older brother also taught him to take things apart and before long he was taking [...] "everything in his house apart to see how it worked". He said that [...] "from a very early age, I also realized I wanted to invent things. So I became really interested in technology and business.

2500|$|Hirsh was {{expected}} to be in the starting rotation in 2008, as the number 4 starter. But he found himself on the disabled list after just two scoreless innings in one spring training game, and started the season on the DL because of a strained muscle in his right rotator cuff and right rotator cuff inflammation. [...] While on the DL, Hirsh spent a number of weeks in a strengthening program and at extended spring training in Tucson, Arizona, to rebuild his arm strength. [...] "This is the first time I've ever really had injuries," [...] Hirsh said. [...] "I had maybe one injury in the minor leagues coming up. Throughout my career, <b>from</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a little kid, I've never had arm problems, I've never broken a bone, I've never rolled an ankle.

2500|$|Ram {{was trained}} by Ronen Moralli at the Israel Tennis Centers in Jerusalem. [...] "My first {{inspiration}} was Jo Jo Lizmi, the famous Jerusalem tennis coach, who showed {{me all the}} basic techniques. I was with him {{four or five years}} and he taught me everything – how to hold the racket, forehand, and backhand. He was very tough." [...] "But the man who really developed my game was Ronen Moralli", says Ram. [...] "He was with me in Jerusalem <b>from</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> 10 years old, but then he moved to Wingate as the national coach." [...] Moralli recalls: [...] "When I worked with Andy at the Jerusalem Tennis Center he was very very energetic and full of passion. [...] His technical abilities weren't as good as the other kids, but he had an understanding of the game. It was something spectacular. [...] He knew when to come to the net, when to stay back. [...] This is something you are born with. [...] Either you have it or you don't. [...] You can teach it, but only up to a certain point, and Andy was born with it." ...|$|E
5000|$|As Barker described, [...] "I {{wanted to}} do {{something}} that was magical and mystical in the way that Doctor Strange was and still is. Doctor Strange was one of my favourite comics <b>from</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a kid. So I suppose Hokum & Hex is my take on that".|$|E
6000|$|... "For twenty years!" [...] I exclaimed. [...] "Oh, Jack, {{you must}} be wrong; for how could that <b>be?</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> only {{eighteen}} <b>when</b> all this happened.

5000|$|... "One of {{the coolest}} things was that I could have vocal lessons twice a week," [...] she recalls. [...] "I've {{always had a}} low voice, but {{you can find a}} couple of shitty covers on YouTube <b>from</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> 12 or whatever, and my voice is quite nasal. Strange tonally. I got to strip all that stuff back and kind of rebuild the machinery, take a lot of twang out of my sound.".|$|E
6000|$|... "He envies me my honour," [...] said de Lescure; [...] "but {{it might}} have been his chance as well as mine, for he was not two feet <b>from</b> me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> wounded."

60|$|From {{that time}} then it pleased me {{to begin to}} plan for my 1919 hunting trip. I can never do {{anything}} reasonably. I always overdo everything.

5000|$|Gearhart {{grew up in}} the Appalachian {{mountains}} of Virginia. She was raised by her grandmother and mother after her parents divorced and the influence of these two would shape her thoughts on the roles and importance of women. Another important influence in her life were the many movies Gearhart watched thanks to the local theater her grandmother owned.

[...] Asked about his food preferences Rossi said, [...] "My favourite is pasta e fagioli, pasta with beans, soupie thing, gorgeous. The older I get, the more I'm into food. ...

[...] "The production has received a warm response from people in the vampire subculture who regularly attend to cheer on the vampires each time they bite someone," [...] said J. Gordon Melton. Sokol later explained [...] "In the early 90s I was {{taking a break from}} music and wanted to combine a Grand Guignol style theater piece with the kinds of experiences I'd have at the movies, both doing Rocky Horror (I was Frank N.

5000|$|As Barker described: I {{wanted to}} do a superhero comic, {{something}} which would be my take on what superheroes were going to be like in the '90s... Hyperkind fell into that category. I {{wanted to do}} something that was magical and mystical in the way that Doctor Strange was and still is. Doctor Strange was one of my favourite comics <b>from</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a kid. So I suppose Hokum & Hex is my take on that. Ectokid, which is perhaps the second weirdest of the bunch, is a kind of dream story for the 15-year-old that's still alive to me — the tale of an adolescent who lives in two worlds and has access to a whole other sphere of reality. And Saint Sinner is just a wild one, the series which hopefully will press the limits of what comics can do.|$|E
