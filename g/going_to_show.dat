It was a degrading experience by which I mean {{it made me feel}} dirty." [...] Although Reeves was infuriated, his response indicated that he believed Bennett's reaction was proof that his decision to include such extreme violence was the correct approach to the material. In his letter published in The Listener, Reeves noted: [...] "Surely the most immoral thing in any form of entertainment is the conditioning of the audience to accept and enjoy violence... Violence is horrible, degrading and sordid. Insofar as one is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> it on the screen at all, it should be presented as such– and the more people it shocks into sickened recognition of these facts the better.

Reed stated the scene was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> Ant-Man's powers, without seeing him, almost [...] "like an Invisible Man sequence, and it's really, really cool. It started to feel tonally disconnected from the movie we were making and story-wise, and it also kind of like, it set a standalone adventure, but it didn’t just connect to the rest of our story...It felt like vestige of those earlier drafts , which as a standalone thing was really cool." [...] Dan Lebental and Colby Parker, Jr. served as film editors. In March 2015, Hayley Atwell confirmed that she would reprise her role as Peggy Carter in the film. In April 2015, Reed stated that the film was not completed yet and would be undergoing [...] "a little bit of additional" [...] filming.|$|E

Tigers' manager Jim Leyland added, [...] "It's a crying shame. Jim [...] is a class guy. This sounds crazy, but after looking at the play, nobody is going to feel worse than he does. I yelled a bit after the game because emotions are high. You just want it so bad for the kid. I don't think you're as mad at the umpire as mad the kid didn't get it—and he did deserve it."

500|$|Jackson {{himself had}} to ditch {{into the sea}} on 10April, {{when he was shot}} down after being {{surprised}} by three Zeros during another of his solo reconnaissance missions near Lae. After playing dead beside his crashed plane to discourage the Japanese fighters from machine-gunning him, he swam to shore and made his way through jungle for over a week to Wau, with the help of two New Guinea natives. When he arrived back at Port Moresby in a US Douglas Dauntless on 23April, a Japanese air raid was in progress and a bullet cut off the tip of his right index finger. Having survived his trek through the jungle, he dismissed the wound as [...] "a mere scratch". On 27April, Jackson met with his pilots and revealed that some senior RAAF officers had expressed dissatisfaction with the way in which No.75 Squadron was avoiding dogfighting with the Japanese Zeros. Jackson and his men had generally eschewed such tactics owing to the Zero's superiority to the Kittyhawk in close combat. The senior officers' comments had evidently stung him, however, as he declared to his pilots: [...] "Tomorrow I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> you how". According to journalist Osmar White, who saw him {{on the night of the}} 27th, Jackson's [...] "hands and eyes were still and rock steady" [...] but he appeared [...] "weary in soul" [...] and [...] "too long in the shadows". White concluded: [...] "He had done more than conquer fear—he had killed it". The next day, Jackson led No.75 Squadron's five remaining airworthy Kittyhawks to intercept a force of Japanese bombers and their escort. He destroyed an enemy fighter before being shot down and killed. His aircraft hit the side of a mountain and embedded itself six feet; Jackson was identified only by his size-ten boots and the revolver he habitually wore. His final tally of aerial victories during the war was eight.|$|E

500|$|In {{his first}} full season in 1938, he batted [...]343 – behind only batting {{champion}} Jimmie Foxx's [...]349 – while leading the league with 18 triples. Upon {{the conclusion of the}} season, Heath joined fellow American League (AL) players, and Indians teammate Bob Feller, in exhibition games played around the country (also known as barnstorming), mostly in cities which did not have a major league team. He had 21 home runs and 112 RBIs, collected 58 hits in August alone, and was among the league leaders in slugging average and total bases for the 1938 season. In January 1939, he married Theabelle Callard. He finished with a [...]292 batting average in 1939. The season also included a late-season punch to a fan from Heath during a home game in Cleveland. [...] "It was just another blunder in a bad season that has been full of mistakes", Heath said of the incident. Before the 1940 season, Heath said, [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> 'em I'm no flash in the pan. Last year I was overswinging and taking my eye of the ball. I'm {{not going to do that}} this season." [...] During the season, Heath was one of 12 reported players who presented a list of grievances against Vitt to Indians President Alva Bradley. Bradley called a meeting with the players and by the end of it, a statement of support from the players for Vitt was released. Twenty-one Indians signed the document, while Heath was one of four who did not, as he was one of two in the hospital at the time of the meeting. Instances between Vitt and his players, including Heath, continued past June, however. Heath was suspended by Vitt after a game in August after the two exchanged words following a strikeout by Heath, who was put in the game as a pinch-hitter. Indians Vice President C.C. Slapnicka withdrew the suspension. The Indians finished the regular season with an 89–65 record in Vitt's last season as manager and Heath a career-low [...]219 average. The Indians lost the AL pennant by one game to the Detroit Tigers and Heath received much of the blame, although Vitt was released as the team's manager and replaced by Roger Peckinpaugh.|$|E
