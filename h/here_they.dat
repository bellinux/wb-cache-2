5|$|A {{centre of}} {{religious}} discussions called Anubhava Mantapa ("Hall of experience") in Kalyani became the conclave where devotees gathered {{to discuss their}} mystic experiences. <b>Here,</b> <b>they</b> expressed their devotion to Shiva in simple poems called Vachanas. These were spontaneous utterances of rhythmic, epigrammatical and satirical prose emphasising the worthlessness of riches, rituals and book learning. Many of these poems are anonymous, but the authors are identifiable by the unique divine name of the god Shiva that is invoked in the poem.|$|E
5|$|At about 8:30pm, {{the men of}} the 5th and 6th regiments met at Camden Station {{along with}} some 200 police. As {{reported}} by The Sun, Governor Carroll and Mayor Latrobe were present at the station, along with B vice president King, General Herbert and his staff, and a number of police commissioners. <b>Here</b> <b>they</b> decided that conditions were too dangerous to send any troops away to Cumberland.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, American prospectors began to spread into the area. Making deals with the Native Tlingit and Tagish tribes, the early prospectors opened the {{important}} routes of Chilkoot and White Pass, and reached the Yukon valley between 1870 and 1890. <b>Here,</b> <b>they</b> encountered the Hän people, semi-nomadic hunters and fishermen who lived along the Yukon and Klondike Rivers. The Hän did not appear to know about the extent of the gold deposits in the region.|$|E

5|$|In {{the western}} {{portion of its}} range, wood turtles are more aquatic. In the east, wood turtles are decidedly more terrestrial, {{especially}} during the summer.

5|$|Just {{before dawn}} on December 14, {{ammunition}} was issued and the 22nd moved forward slightly, {{to about the}} position on the open slope that they had occupied the day before. <b>Here</b> <b>they</b> spent another day pinned to the ground, unable to advance or retire due to the constant fire of Confederate riflemen. Nightfall finally brought relief as another unit took their place {{on the field and}} the 22nd retired to the city of Fredericksburg.|$|E
5|$|Leaving the British Eighth Army to {{continue}} their advance, at 07:00 16July the 1st Parachute Brigade were transported in trucks to Syracuse, where they embarked on a LST. <b>Here</b> <b>they</b> remained overnight, sitting through a two-hour air raid, and sailed for Valletta at 12:00 on 17 July. In Operation Fustian they had suffered around 141 dead, and 168 missing or wounded.|$|E

5|$|On 17August the Germans {{began to}} withdraw, and the 3rd Parachute Brigade started their attack at 03:00.

5|$|The 8th Brigade {{continued}} their advance without interruption to Jinsafut, which was occupied in the evening. The 1st Battalion, Connaught Rangers (7th Brigade) {{were ordered to}} pass through the 8th Brigade and capture the road junction northeast of El Funduq. <b>Here</b> <b>they</b> captured an artillery column of five field guns, horses, wagons and prisoners which had been held up by fire from the 9th Brigade.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarians, or Magyars, {{conquered the}} Carpathian Basin {{at the turn}} of the 9th and 10th centuries. <b>Here</b> <b>they</b> found a {{predominantly}} Slavic-speaking population.

Their raids were halted by Otto I, future Holy Roman Emperor, who defeated them at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955.|$|E
5|$|The battle he is {{best known}} for was the defense of Lunga Ridge on Guadalcanal September 13–14, 1942. His Raider Battalion, with two {{companies}} of the 1st Parachute Battalion attached, were sent to a ridge line a short distance south of Henderson Field. <b>Here,</b> <b>they</b> were supposed to get a short rest but Japanese forces unexpectedly attacked the position on the first evening, penetrating the left center of his line of resistance, forcing a withdrawal to a reserve position.|$|E

5|$|The {{brooding}} anemone (Epiactis prolifera) is gynodioecious, starting life as {{a female}} and later becoming hermaphroditic, so that populations consist of females and hermaphrodites. As a female, the eggs can develop parthenogenetically into female offspring without fertilisation, and as a hermaphrodite, the eggs are routinely self-fertilised. The larvae emerge from the anemone's mouth and tumble down the column, lodging in a fold near the pedal disc. <b>Here</b> <b>they</b> develop and grow, remaining for about three months before crawling off to start independent lives.|$|E

5|$|When {{the brigade}} left the 1st Airborne Task Force, the 1st Special Service Force {{replaced}} them. The task force advanced eastwards {{and reached the}} Franco-Italian border in the Menton area and the French Alps along part of what was the Maginot line. <b>Here</b> <b>they</b> halted in a defensive position for three months before being pulled out. The task force was now surplus to requirements and was disbanded on 23 November 1944. Its surviving manpower was used as reinforcements for the other American airborne formations.|$|E
5|$|A {{strategy}} {{for dealing with}} seasonal plenty is to eat {{as much as possible}} and store the surplus nutrients as fat. Marmots do this, and may be 50% heavier in the autumn than in the spring. They rely on their fat reserves during their long winter hibernation. Beavers feed on the leaves, buds, and inner bark of growing trees, as well as aquatic plants. They store food for winter use by felling small trees and leafy branches in the autumn and immersing them in their pond, sticking the ends into the mud to anchor them. <b>Here,</b> <b>they</b> can access their food supply underwater even when their pond is frozen over.|$|E
5|$|According to Hinchliffe, {{this is an}} {{incorrect}} statement. Hinchliffe based his account on Rumpelhardt's testimony who claims that Schnaufer was never taken to England. Rumpelhardt was released on 4 August 1945 and soon after Schnaufer was admitted {{to a hospital in}} Flensburg, ill with a combination of diphtheria and scarlet fever. Interrogation had begun in late May 1945 by a team of twelve officers from the Department of Air Technical Intelligence (DAT), led by Air Commodore Roderick Aeneas Chisholm. The German prisoners were brought to Eggebek. <b>Here</b> <b>they</b> conducted a number of interviews with various members of the night fighter force.|$|E
