In particular, during one period of research, he described himself studying his own three children, and carefully observing and interpreting their cognitive development. In one of his last books, Equilibration of Cognitive Structures: The Central Problem of Intellectual Development, he intends to explain <b>knowledge</b> <b>development</b> as a process of equilibration using two main concepts in his theory, assimilation and accommodation, as belonging not only to biological interactions but also to cognitive ones.|$|E

The guide {{describes}} {{use of the}} NetWeaver <b>knowledge</b> base <b>development</b> system. <b>Knowledge</b> representation in NetWeaver is based on object-oriented fuzzy-logic networks that offer several significant advantages over the more traditional rulebased representation. Compared to rule-based knowledge bases, NetWeaver knowledge bases are easier to build, test, and maintain because the underlying object-based representation makes them modular. The modularity of NetWeaver knowledge bases, in turn, allows designers to gradually evolve complex knowledge bases from simpler ones in small, simple steps. Modularity also allows interactive knowledge base debugging at any and all stages of <b>knowledge</b> base <b>development,</b> which expedites the development process. Finally, fuzzy [...] ...|$|R
