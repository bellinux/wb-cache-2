50|$|Toward the Suez War, the {{logistical}} corps {{undertook a}} massive purchase from France and recruited many civilian vehicles. In 1966, the IDF implemented reforms in its logistical branches, and nine professional centres were established to centralize the logistical activities, under the Quartermasters Directorate. The new logistical centres model proved effective during the Six Days War. During the War of Attrition, the corps supplied troops {{situated on the}} Bar Lev Line, which suffered heavy <b>fire.</b> <b>Supply</b> stations were created in the Sinai and the responsibility for construction in the IDF {{was transferred to the}} Quartermasters Directorate.|$|E
5000|$|As {{described}} in a film magazine, Yvonne (Vidor), the wife of German officer Karl Von Drutz (von Seyffertitz), is left in their Belgian home {{at the start of}} World War I. King Albert (Hall) stops at the house during his retreat where he finds little Jacques (Stone) playing soldier. The king tells him to be brave and wait [...] "till I come back to you." [...] America enters the war and Capt. Jefferson Strong (Washburn) is detailed to destroy the German storehouse containing their liquid <b>fire</b> <b>supply.</b> He pretends to be an escaped German soldier and hides in Yvonne's cottage, learns of the supplies, and directs the tunneling under the house. Von Drutz returns, finds Strong telephoning, and a terrific struggle ensues. Little Jacques takes a score of orphans from a nearby asylum and they escape through the tunnel. Strong saves the lives of the children but is arrested for disobedience, tried, and court martialed. Through the influence of King Albert he is saved from being shot. Yvonne, whose husband has been killed, finds consolation in Strong's love.|$|E
40|$|The city of Moscow {{is expecting}} {{significant}} growth in {{population in the}} upcoming years. The city anticipates increased demands on the water system as well as increased peak hour requirements. This project is intended to provide engineers with a design, to consider, for a booster pump station that meets current and future water supply needs as well as provides {{easy access to the}} pump for maintenance. The current Booster Pump Station is underground which makes access by maintenance workers extremely difficult. To facilitate operation and maintenance, new upgraded pumps and a new pump house structure is being designed with an additional standby pump to meet design requirement provided in case of maintenance or failure or primary pumps. Pump capacity and housing (foundation and structure) must be adequate enough to account for demand growth, be prepared for estimated <b>fire</b> <b>supply,</b> and protect pumps and generators from the climate. In addition to the pump house, an asphalt parking lot with a two vehicle capacity is being designed to enable pump house access for maintenance that also connects to a roadway with a parallel water slough to empty out into the city sewer system...|$|E

50|$|In February, 1917, {{a rather}} serious but {{localized}} break of typhoid fever occurred in Utica, New York which upon {{an investigation by}} this Department was attributed to an infection {{of the water in}} the mains through cross connections between auxiliary <b>fire</b> <b>supplies</b> from polluted sources. The results of analyses of the raw water from the Hinckley supply have shown in the past a moderate amount of active contamination as indicated by the total bacterial counts and the presence of organisms of the E. coli type.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{reliability}} {{models and}} calculation of <b>fire</b> water <b>supply</b> system {{was introduced to}} analyze the reliability of four water-supply modes of automatic fire sprinkler system in high-rise buildings. Study {{results showed that the}} reliability of fire pump parallel connected system is the highest, which consists with the provision of the code for design of water extinguishing system of civil buildings when the building height is {{less than or equal to}} 120 meters. And the methods of improving reliability of <b>fire</b> water <b>supply</b> system were concluded, which benefitted the optimal design of automatic fire sprinkler system...|$|R
50|$|The song, however, has now {{spread around}} the world, {{starting}} when fans of the U.S. men's national team used the tune in their first match after the September 11 attacks in a World Cup qualifier in Foxborough, Massachusetts against Jamaica. Amongst the supporters' clubs which have used the tune have been those in Portsmouth, Leicester City F.C., Chicago Fire, VfL Bochum, Wellington Phoenix, Sydney FC and D.C. United. In fact, Section 8 Chicago, a supporters' club for Chicago <b>Fire,</b> <b>supplied</b> lyrics for the previously instrumental tune. Rugby League rivals St. Helen's RLFC and Wigan Warriors both play it after a successful try conversion.|$|R
2500|$|Fusion or pattern matching: {{fundamentals}} may {{be perceived}} through pattern matching of the separately analyzed partials to a best-fit exact-harmonic template ( [...] , [...] ) or the best-fit subharmonic ( [...] , [...] ), or harmonics may be perceptually fused into one entity, with dissonances being those intervals less likely mistaken for unisons, the imperfect intervals, because of the multiple estimates, at perfect intervals, of fundamentals, for one harmonic tone ( [...] , [...] ). By these definitions, inharmonic partials of otherwise harmonic spectra are usually processed separately (Hartmann et al., 1990), unless frequency or amplitude modulated coherently with the harmonic partials [...] For some of these definitions, neural <b>firing</b> <b>supplies</b> the data for pattern matching; see directly below (e.g., [...] ).|$|R

6000|$|A hard rain, lasting {{a day and}} a night, was {{followed}} by a clear, warm spell and during that time the boys enjoyed themselves to their hearts' content. Whopper was now practically well, although the cut on his cheek still sported several bits of court-plaster. Every morning the young hunters got up at sunrise and took a dip in the lake, following this up by a good rub-down, for they had brought the necessary coarse towels with them. This always rendered them wideawake and gave them appetites which could not have been better. They took turns at cooking and baking, and at washing dishes and keeping the <b>fire</b> <b>supplied</b> with wood. They were certainly happy, and the time seemed to [...] "fairly fly," [...] as Shep expressed it.|$|R

50|$|When {{standpipes}} {{are fixed}} into buildings, the pipe {{is in place}} permanently with an intake usually located near a road or driveway, so that a <b>fire</b> engine can <b>supply</b> water to the system. The standpipe extends into the building to <b>supply</b> <b>fire</b> fighting water to {{the interior of the}} structure via hose outlets, often located between each pair of floors in stairwells in high rise buildings. Dry standpipes are not filled with water until needed in fire fighting. Fire fighters often bring hoses in with them and attach them to standpipe outlets located along the pipe throughout the structure. This type of standpipe may also be installed horizontally on bridges.|$|R
