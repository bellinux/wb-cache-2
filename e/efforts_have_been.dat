5|$|Draw by agreement: Draws {{are most}} {{commonly}} reached {{by mutual agreement}} between the players. The correct procedure is to verbally offer the draw, make a move, then start the opponent's clock. Traditionally, players {{have been allowed to}} agree to a draw at any point in the game, occasionally even without playing a move; in recent years <b>efforts</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made to discourage short draws, for example by forbidding draw offers before move thirty.|$|E

As {{part of the national}} conservation effort, more than 1.2 million trees have been replanted to check the advancement of the desert, which incidentally also helps the local economy by way of financial return from acacia trees, which produce gum arabic, and also from fruit trees.|$|E
5|$|Fossil records {{indicate}} that in pre-Polynesian times, the kakapo was New Zealand's third most common bird {{and it was}} widespread on all three main islands. However, the kakapo population in New Zealand has declined massively since human settlement of the country. Since 1891, conservation <b>efforts</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made to prevent extinction. The most successful scheme has been the Kakapo Recovery Programme; this was implemented in 1989 and continues.|$|E
5|$|Most of Carabane {{is covered}} in mangroves, forming an impassable jungle {{that can only be}} crossed in {{constructed}} passages. Mangroves are among the few species capable of adapting to the highly saline environment, where the quantity of oxygen in the soil is low. In recent decades there has been concern that the mangroves are less prevalent. There are various reasons for the degradation, including crustaceans and the unregulated exploitation of wood. <b>Efforts</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made to safeguard the mangroves and to educate children about their importance.|$|E

5|$|Between 1907 and 1920 Bruce {{made many}} {{journeys}} to the Arctic regions, both for scientific and for commercial purposes. His failure to mount any major exploration ventures after the SNAE is usually attributed to {{his lack of}} public relations skills, powerful enemies, and his fervent Scottish nationalism. By 1919 his health was failing, and he experienced several spells in hospital {{before his death in}} 1921, after which he was almost totally forgotten. In recent years, following the centenary of the Scottish Expedition, <b>efforts</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made to give fuller recognition to his role in the history of scientific polar exploration.|$|E
5|$|During a {{subsequent}} confrontation with thirteen Japanese aircraft on 1 December, Armidale {{was struck by}} two torpedoes and a bomb, and began to sink; the order to abandon ship was given. After helping to free a life-raft, Sheean was wounded by two bullets. He {{made his way to}} the aft Oerlikon 20mm cannon and began to fire on the Japanese aircraft to protect those in the water. Sheean managed to shoot down one of the Japanese bombers, but was killed when Armidale sank. Many of the survivors credited their lives to Sheean and he was posthumously mentioned in despatches. In 1999, the submarine HMAS Sheean was named in his honour, and <b>efforts</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made to have Sheean belatedly awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park is {{an almost}} {{pristine}} ecosystem and the same species of flora and fauna that have existed since prehistoric times can still be found there. More than 1,000species of vascular plants, dozens of species of mammals, 300 species of birds, {{more than a dozen}} fish species and a few species of reptiles and amphibians exist. Due to various changes in the ecosystem, some of them human-induced, <b>efforts</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made to provide enhanced protection to some species of native fish and the increasingly threatened whitebark pine.|$|E

5|$|HIV is {{typically}} transmitted through unprotected sex or intravenous drug use, {{and is often}} associated with groups such as promiscuous gay men, illicit drug users, and sex workers. For these reasons, and also because of fears of contagion, people living with HIV are frequently subjected to stigma and discrimination. Publicity campaigns around the world have aimed to counter HIV-related prejudices and misconceptions and to replace them with an accurate understanding that helps to prevent new infections. These <b>efforts</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> aided by various celebrities – including American basketball star Magic Johnson and South African judge Edwin Cameron – who have publicly announced that they are HIV-positive.|$|E
5|$|Malawi {{has taken}} many steps towards slowing {{the spread of}} HIV/AIDS, such as {{increasing}} access to condoms and improving testing services and treatment options.

The World Bank has lent $407.9 million to Malawi, the Global Fund has agreed to give $390 million, and PEPFAR has donated $25 million for prevention and treatment campaigns.|$|E
5|$|RNAi {{has been}} used to genetically {{engineer}} plants to produce lower levels of natural plant toxins. Such techniques take advantage of the stable and heritable RNAi phenotype in plant stocks. Cotton seeds are rich in dietary protein but naturally contain the toxic terpenoid product gossypol, making them unsuitable for human consumption. RNAi {{has been used}} to produce cotton stocks whose seeds contain reduced levels of delta-cadinene synthase, a key enzyme in gossypol production, without affecting the enzyme's production {{in other parts of the}} plant, where gossypol is itself important in preventing damage from plant pests. Similar <b>efforts</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> directed toward the reduction of the cyanogenic natural product linamarin in cassava plants.|$|E
