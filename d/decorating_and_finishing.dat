40|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} suggests that {{a wide range of}} metalworking techniques was employed during the Iron Age in Britain. This study examines the metalworking tools which have survived, principally those made of iron, and includes hearth implements, and tools for forming, <b>decorating,</b> <b>and</b> <b>finishing</b> metals. The ferrous metalworking tools are analysed in terms of typology and technology. Their occurrence in different types of archaeological contexts is examined, in particular relationships with metalworking residues. Functional and social use of the tools is discussed. Forty-one edge tools and six hearth implements are examined by metallography. The results are discussed according to tool type, and are further assessed by comparison with other categories of Iron Age ferrous artifacts (from published sources), and with metalworking tools of similar date from the Continent...|$|E

40|$|Housing {{interior}} walls are <b>decorated</b> <b>and</b> <b>finished</b> with various decorative materials of paints of varying properties ranging from texture to coloration. In choosing the preferred <b>finishing</b> <b>and</b> decorative materials, housing owners, users and prospective owners have attendant underlying factors and {{reasons for their}} choices. These choice activities usually provoke and invoke certain perceptual orientations that underlie the choices. These perceptual orientations are normally very complex and can only be disentangled by elicitation. This paper presents perceptual orientations of prospective house owners‟ choice and preference for {{interior walls}} finishes in Yola, Nigeria. The study was conducted within the theoretical and conceptual framework of means-end chain (MEC) model. 15 prospective house owners were interviewed using the laddering interviewing technique after a structured questionnaire survey was carried out. The results showed that twelve (12) identified unique perceptual orientation pathways were established, motivated by four (4) user values, and intervened by four (4) expected functional affordances. The findings disentangled the design expectations of housing users/owners for finishing their housing interiors which can be pointers for designers and Architects for their design processes and decisions...|$|R

40|$|This {{investigation}} used Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don.) as a material, one of {{the main}} plantations in Taiwan. After first having been through the pressure treatment process with a commercial fire retardant chemical (FR), the flame-retardent panels, for indoor use, were manufactured using the hot pressing method. The objective of this research was to increase the value-added dimension of the end product, thereby increasing the utilization of Taiwan 2 ̆ 7 s plantations. The hope was to enable Japanese cedar plantations in Taiwan to improve upon their economic efficiency by providing information to forestry industry workers, interior <b>decorates,</b> <b>and</b> <b>finishing</b> material suppliers, thereby increasing the profit indirectly for the forestry workers in change of their own forest. The results obtained showed that the flame retardancy of the panels was substantially increased after being pressure treated with FR and then hot pressed. In addition, the physical properties improved as well. The results of the micrographic and soft X-ray analysis showed that FR occured inside the cell cavity or lumen of the panels, and resulted in a higher surface density of the panels, reaching up to 1. 80 g/cm[3]. Based on the results of this study, hot pressing for 30 min with 4 MPa at 120 ℃ was able to quality for CNS 11668, and reach the second grade of CNS 7614 as well...|$|R
5000|$|Inside, {{the floor}} {{plan of the}} church is that of a Latin cross. The main altarpiece is neoclassical and the work of Manuel Tolsá, which was created to replace the {{original}} Baroque one done by Pedro Patiño Ixtolinque. The altar {{to the left of the}} transept is dedicated to the Virgin of Covadonga. On a wall in the wide central area, there is a large niche containing the image of the Virgin Mary. Above this is a sculpture depicting the scene at the Calvary. Higher still is an oil painting of the Coronation of Mary and at the crest is the cross of the Battle of Covandonga between two windows. Each of the lateral windows has two oil paintings <b>decorating</b> them <b>and</b> <b>finished</b> with the coat-of-arms of Castile as well as the emblem of the Dominican order. This area is completed with the reliefs of saints and the carvings of cherubs. At the right of the transept, there is the Virgin del Camino altarpiece created by Alonso López de Herrera. The altarpiece contains figures called the [...] "Descent," [...] "Saint Dominic in Soriano," [...] and gilded statues of the martyrs Saint Peter and Vicente Ferrer. The church also has a choir in the shape of a horseshoe with 32 seats made of cedar, each with an image of a different saint carved in relief into the backs.|$|R

40|$|As in {{many other}} prehistoric and {{primitive}} ceramics, Jomon pottery has two categories, coarse ware and fine ware, the former poorly <b>decorated</b> <b>and</b> the latter well <b>decorated</b> <b>and</b> finely <b>finished.</b> Vessel shapes of the coarse wares are often restricted to simple shaped jars, though the fine wares {{have a lot of}} variation in forms. The reason for this difference has been explained as difference in usage, that the fine wares were used only by special occasions such as feasts or rituals, while the coarse wares were used domestically. The small quantity of presence of fine wares from archaeological sites seems to support this explanation, but there are still quite many questions to be answered; Why the coarse wares had slow change in style though they must have been produced {{from time to time in}} large quantity, how the presence of so called "semifine" wares be explained, how they actually were used by such special occasions. And also few studies has been made concerning how these wares were produced, whether they were supplied by more than one pot-making settlements or both of them were made at each settlement. Ethnographic data and archaeological studies show that potters often change tempering materials and clays both in quality and in quantity according to vessel function. Through petrographic analysis, an attempt was made to see if Jomon potters used different pastes to make these wares. The samples are from Giombara shellmidden, Chiba prefecture. 41 fine ware sherds and 59 coarse ware sherds of Kasori-B type, late Jomon period, were selected (Fig. 1 - 4) for analysis. As little difference was noticed as to non-plastic in-clusions, grain size analysis was applied. The counting results are shown in Table 1 - 2. The average of the ratio of coarse sand to total amount of sand included in the fine wares was higher than that of the coarse wares. The fact that the ratio of coarse sand to total sand had stronger correlation with total sand amount by the fine wares also imply the usage of coarser sand temper for fine ware manufacture. According to ethnographic data, water vessels and cooking wares are often tempered with rough materials, but as Jomon fine wares have many vessel forms, the idea that the fine wares were water jars and cooking vessels, and the coarse wares played the other roles cannot be accepted. Possible explanation would be; 1) that there were more than one pottery making settlements, and those wares were supplied from different places, 2) that there were two tradition of pottery making within the settlement, 3) that potters used different clays or tempers for those pottery, for reason unknown. The petrological study of provenance, but technological pottery has been stressed on the and functional points of view also assumption have to be of the pottery considered...|$|R
