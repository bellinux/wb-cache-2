500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment Weiss spoke about Arya's story, saying [...] "Arya is in danger, she's got an open wound in her stomach, and the one person who has protected her to this point unfortunately gets murdered. The fact that the Many-Faced God gets {{the people who have been}} promised to him really makes you think that there's almost an inevitability about what happens to people who run afoul of the Faceless Men, as Arya has done." [...] Weiss continued about the final part of the sequence, [...] "Arya's telling Jaqen by putting the face on the wall that 'this account is settled, and we're <b>good</b> <b>here,</b> and now I'm going to walk away,' and I think she knows what the answer's going to be. The implication, obviously, is that Jaqen was, on some level, rooting for the outcome that he got. He may be [...] "no one," [...] but there's still enough of a person left in him to respect, and admire who this girl is and what she's become. Arya finally tells us something that we've kind of known all along, that she's not no one, she's Arya Stark of Winterfell." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics, {{with a few}} detractors. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book, Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, calling the script [...] "very stylish". The two noted that [...] " [...] Duchovny is very <b>good</b> <b>here</b> [...] and, as a counterbalance, [...] Anderson provides some great comic relief." [...] Shearman and Pearson concluded that the episode was [...] "a little too ponderously paced to be a classic episode, but it's clever and well crafted [...] a rewarding stand-out." [...] Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 4 out of 5 stars and wrote that [...] "Cawing birds, spirit portals and split personalities are {{the order of the}} day in a story that doesn't offer that much in genuine thrills, but the best moments are Scully's occasional complaints from the field." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. Despite noting that the episode [...] "gets off to an awkward start", Vitaris concluded that [...] "'Chimera' takes us into the heart of a quintessential X-Files family". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+", noting that, while the episode was good, it [...] "falls short of classic status, trying to make a metaphor into flesh, and not quite succeeding." [...] Although Handlen enjoyed the way the episode explores and then connects the main characters, his main critique was that Ellen's transformation is never explicitly explained. He explained that, [...] "If we had a sense of where her need comes from, if there was some hint at what drove her to this point, it would work; as is, the actress’s performance is excellent, but the character remains too generic." ...|$|E
