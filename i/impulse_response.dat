We apply the procedure to study the effects of oil price shocks using a representative sample of over 1000 Swiss firms.

40|$|Based on a {{polyphase}} {{analysis of}} a subband adaptive filter (SAF) system, {{it is possible to}} calculate the optimum subband <b>impulse</b> <b>responses</b> to which the SAF system will converge. In this paper, we give some insight into how these optimum <b>impulse</b> <b>responses</b> are calculated, and discuss two applications of our technique. Firstly, the performance limitations of an SAF system can be explored with respect to the minimum mean square error performance. Secondly, fullband <b>impulse</b> <b>responses</b> can be correctly projected into the subband domain, which is required for example for translating constraints for subband adaptive beamforming. Examples for both applications are presented...|$|R

25|$|The Laplace {{transform}} is used {{frequently in}} engineering and physics; {{the output of}} a linear time-invariant system can be calculated by convolving its unit <b>impulse</b> <b>response</b> with the input signal.

25|$|Even {{though this}} is not what is {{physically}} done, an identical output can be generated by applying the hypothetical sequence of Dirac impulses, xs(t), to a linear, time-invariant system, otherwise known as a linear filter with such characteristics (which, for an LTI system, are fully described by the <b>impulse</b> <b>response)</b> so that each input impulse results in the correct piecewise linear function in the output.|$|E
25|$|Wavelet {{theory is}} {{applicable}} to several subjects. All wavelet transforms {{may be considered}} forms of time-frequency representation for continuous-time (analog) signals and so are related to harmonic analysis. Almost all practically useful discrete wavelet transforms use discrete-time filterbanks. These filter banks are called the wavelet and scaling coefficients in wavelets nomenclature. These filterbanks may contain either finite <b>impulse</b> <b>response</b> (FIR) or infinite <b>impulse</b> <b>response</b> (IIR) filters. The wavelets forming a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) {{are subject to the}} uncertainty principle of Fourier analysis respective sampling theory: Given a signal with some event in it, one cannot assign simultaneously an exact time and frequency response scale to that event. The product of the uncertainties of time and frequency response scale has a lower bound. Thus, in the scaleogram of a continuous wavelet transform of this signal, such an event marks an entire region in the time-scale plane, instead of just one point. Also, discrete wavelet bases may be considered in the context of other forms of the uncertainty principle.|$|E

25|$|The {{sampling}} theorem was {{implied by}} the work of Harry Nyquist in 1928,nbsp& in which he showed that up to 2B independent pulse samples could be sent through a system of bandwidth B; but he did not explicitly consider the problem of sampling and reconstruction of continuous signals. About the same time, Karl Küpfmüller showed a similar result, and discussed the sinc-function <b>impulse</b> <b>response</b> of a band-limiting filter, via its integral, the step response Integralsinus; this bandlimiting and reconstruction filter that is so central to the sampling theorem is sometimes referred to as a Küpfmüller filter (but seldom so in English).|$|E
25|$|A {{system with}} low quality factor (Q<nbsp&) {{is said to}} be overdamped. Such a system doesn't {{oscillate}} at all, but when displaced from its equilibrium steady-state output it returns to it by exponential decay, approaching the steady state value asymptotically. It has an <b>impulse</b> <b>response</b> that is the sum of two decaying exponential functions with different rates of decay. As the quality factor decreases the slower decay mode becomes stronger relative to the faster mode and dominates the system's response resulting in a slower system. A second-order low-pass filter with a very low quality factor has a nearly first-order step response; the system's output responds to a step input by slowly rising toward an asymptote.|$|E
25|$|Examples {{of typical}} {{measurements}} are: amplitude and phase characteristics vs. frequency; <b>impulse</b> <b>response</b> under {{one or more}} conditions (e.g., square waves, sine wave bursts, etc.); directivity vs. frequency (e.g., horizontally, vertically, spherically, etc.); harmonic and intermodulation distortion vs. sound pressure level (SPL) output, using any of several test signals; stored energy (i.e., ringing) at various frequencies; impedance vs. frequency; and small-signal vs. large-signal performance. Most of these measurements require sophisticated and often expensive equipment to perform, and also good judgment by the operator, but the raw sound pressure level output is rather easier to report and so is often the only specified value—sometimes in misleadingly exact terms. The sound pressure level (SPL) a loudspeaker produces is measured in decibels (dBspl).|$|E
