5|$|Phil {{explains}} to Mulder {{that he wanted}} a divorce from Ellen two years ago, but she got pregnant and would not allow it. He also believes {{that he is the}} reason for this happening and that <b>he</b> <b>somehow</b> summoned the entity. It turns out that Ellen is the entity, which is given away by a cut in her back given by Jenny during the attack. Ellen transforms into the creature, attacks Mulder, and attempts to drown him in a bath tub, but stops when she sees her monstrous reflection in the water. She is placed in a psychiatric hospital, where the doctors diagnose her with multiple personality disorder. Meanwhile, Scully reveals to Mulder that the mysterious prostitute killer was not an X-File at all, but rather a man disguised as a woman who talked to the prostitutes about religion and attempted to help them get out of the prostitution ring.|$|E
25|$|During {{his office}} as vicarius Africae he {{received}} a law against Donatism; however it seems <b>he</b> <b>somehow</b> sided with the Donatists, if in 405 Augustine of Hippo misbelieved him a Donatist. In this office he, together with Decimius Hilarianus Hesperius, {{was in charge of}} the investigations around a scandal involving the city of Leptis Magna, but his conclusions, included into a report, had the citizens cleared of the charges and not guilty; afterwards the citizens of Leptis Magna erected him a statue.|$|E
25|$|Bradman was hurried by Gilbert, but <b>he</b> <b>somehow</b> {{managed to}} keep the first ball out. The second was a {{harmless}} one, just outside leg. The third ball was too quick: it screamed past Bradman's bat and thudded into the gloves of Leonard Waterman. The fourth was as fast, and hit Bradman on his underbelly. The impact knocked his bat off, leaving him in agony. It took him time, but {{he got back to}} his feet. Then came the bouncer, a really quick one. Bradman tried to counterattack, but it was too quick. The top-edge went up in the air, and Waterman took it easily.|$|E

50|$|Doug detested {{pretension}} and artifice - {{he certainly}} {{knew that the}} clothes do not make the man. If <b>he’s</b> <b>somehow</b> observing us, <b>he’s</b> laughing about us wearing suits and ties on this occasion. At the same time, he reveled in the unabashed quirkiness and fakery he observed on his frequent drives along America’s highways and byways.|$|R

25|$|During his {{frequent}} trips to Pakistan, Gilani {{hung out with}} heroin users and started using the drug himself. He became involved in Pakistani drug trafficking. When he was twenty-four, Gilani smuggled half a kilogram of heroin out of Pakistani tribal areas and used Tahawwur Hussain Rana, a Pakistani army doctor who Gilani knew from military school, as an unwitting shield. Several days later, police in Lahore arrested Gilani for drug possession, but <b>he</b> <b>somehow</b> managed to beat the charges. Rana continued {{to be used by}} Gilani {{over the course of his}} career as a drug trafficker; in the late 1990s, after Rana had emigrated to the U.S., Gilani used Rana's legitimate immigration consulting company in Chicago to smuggle drugs.|$|E
25|$|However, in one dream, <b>he</b> <b>somehow</b> {{goes back}} to the time of Fallen Leaves' tribe as a young sharpclaw (warrior) called Jay's Wing. The Tribe is being {{threatened}} by Twoleg expansion and votes to move to the mountains. Jaypaw suddenly realizes that this Tribe becomes the Tribe of Rushing Water and they originated from the Clan's current lake home, so he helps by voting that they should go. When he returns to the Clans, he asks Lionblaze to fetch the catmint. Lionblaze refuses because of dreams where he kills Heatherpaw in the tunnels, but as the greencough gets worse, he finally goes. Lionblaze gets the catmint and gives it to Jaypaw, but not without a tension-filled encounter with Heatherpaw, now called Heathertail. Soon the Clan is healed and Jaypaw finally receives his full medicine cat name, Jayfeather.|$|E
25|$|In 1946 Simpson {{developed}} {{a special interest}} in cosmic rays, which very little was known about at the time as the field which was {{still in the process of}} being established, including their origin. Beginning with investigations pertaining to the cosmic ray neutrons in the lower atmosphere, Simpson was there from the beginning developmental phases of the field, and contributed significantly throughout the years to its development with his scientific investigations. Simpson's contributions were unique in that <b>he</b> <b>somehow</b> accomplished his work in a way which boosted the accomplishments and careers of others around him such as graduate students, research associates and other faculty. In 1955 he gave Eugene N. Parker a job as a research associate in the Enrico Fermi Institute of the University of Chicago, and his progress was largely a consequence of Simpson's continued support. His research on cosmic ray neutrons in the lower atmosphere was developed upon its founding by Serge Korff before World War II. Simpson in his research contributed the discovery that the latitude effect seen with neutrons is around 20 times greater than with ionization chambers in 1949. In 1951 he found that the time variations are much greater as well. He had recognized the potential of the neutrons and the lower energy cosmic ray particles for exploring the causes of the time variations. That year he also invented the neutron monitor to fulfill the need for a stable ground-based neutron detector. In doing so, he established neutron monitor stations at various locations including Peru, Huancayo, Mexico, Mexico City, New Mexico, Sacramento Peak, Colorado, Climax, and Chicago Illinois.|$|E

50|$|While playing basketball, Connor tells Avery he is {{concerned}} that <b>he's</b> <b>somehow</b> responsible for the killings. Avery suggests that Connor {{try to find the}} real culprit, and Connor agrees before dunking the basketball. In their room, the boys compare notes on their research. They have each come to the same conclusion: each victim had had a Detective Cavanaugh involved with their case.|$|R

500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Larkin made audio {{recordings}} (in studio conditions) of each of his three mature collections, and separate recordings of [...] groups of poems {{for a number of}} audio anthologies, <b>he</b> <b>somehow</b> gained a reputation as a poet who was reluctant to make recordings in which he read his own work. While Larkin did express a dislike of the sound of his own voice ("I come from Coventry, between the sloppiness of Leicester and the whine of Birmingham, you know—and sometimes it comes out"), the evidence indicates that this influenced more his preference not to give public readings of his own work, than his willingness to make audio recordings of his poems.|$|E
500|$|In July 1942, Kenney {{received}} {{orders to}} take over the Allied Air Forces and Fifth Air Force in General Douglas MacArthur's Southwest Pacific Area. MacArthur had been dissatisfied with the performance of his air commander, Lieutenant General George Brett. Andrews, by then a major general, turned down the job, and, offered a choice between Kenney and Major General James Doolittle, MacArthur chose Kenney. Kenney reported to MacArthur in Brisbane on 28 July 1942, and was treated to [...] "a lecture for approximately an hour on the shortcomings of the Air Force in general, and the Allied Air Forces in the Southwest Pacific in particular." [...] Kenney felt that MacArthur did not understand air operations, but recognized that <b>he</b> <b>somehow</b> needed to establish a good working relationship with him. When he asked MacArthur for authority to send people he considered [...] "deadwood" [...] home, something that his superiors in Washington, D.C. had refused to give, MacArthur enthusiastically approved.|$|E
2500|$|... nobody drew shoes the way Andy did. <b>He</b> <b>somehow</b> {{gave each}} shoe a {{temperament}} of its own, {{a sort of}} sly, Toulouse-Lautrec kind of sophistication, but the shape and the style came through accurately and the buckle {{was always in the}} right place. The kids in the apartment [...] noticed that the vamps on Andy's shoe drawings kept getting longer and longer but [...] Miller didn't mind. Miller loved them.|$|E

2500|$|However, Ketchum was persistent, spread {{information}} in various medical circles, and in October 1910 got written {{up in the}} press. [...] When a reporter contacted Cayce, he explained to the reporter that <b>he</b> <b>somehow</b> {{had the ability to}} easily go into the intuitive sleep when he wanted to, and this was different from how he went to sleep normally like everyone else. [...] When asked the mechanism of the readings via the sleep method, they were told that it happened via the capabilities of the subconscious mind.|$|E
2500|$|Mick Mercer {{stated that}} Gill was [...] "not a Goth. Never a Goth. The bands he listed as his chosen form of ear-bashing were relentlessly metal and {{standard}} grunge, rock and goth metal, with some industrial presence". Mercer stated that [...] "Kimveer Gill listened to metal", [...] "He had nothing whatsoever {{to do with}} Goth" [...] and further commented [...] "I realise that like many [...] , Kimveer Gill may even have believed <b>he</b> <b>somehow</b> was a Goth, because they're [...] only really noted for spectacularly missing the point".|$|E
2500|$|Near {{the end of}} {{the first}} half, Paraguayan referee Carlos Amarilla assumed that Togo's Emmanuel Adebayor had taken a dive in the penalty area, whereas most replays implied his heels had been clipped by Patrick Muller. [...] The website Sport Network {{discusses}} the incident as follows: [...] "Referee Carlos Amarilla caused controversy in the thirty-fifth minute when <b>he</b> <b>somehow</b> failed to give a penalty after Adebayor was hacked down by Patrick Muller. The Arsenal man had cut inside and seemed ready to unleash a shot at the Swiss goal, until Muller's trailing leg took Adebayor down." ...|$|E

2500|$|A brief prequel {{released}} before season {{five and}} on the season five DVD set features a young Omar, his brother Anthony, and an unidentified older boy planning and executing a robbery of a man {{at a bus stop}} in 1985 Baltimore. [...] Even as a young boy, Omar shows remarkable intelligence, morality, and force of character by first questioning the value of robbing the man and then compelling the unidentified older boy (at gunpoint) to return the money. [...] Anthony expresses tired amusement at Omar's actions, demonstrating his familiarity with his brother's forceful personality. Omar is shown with his characteristic facial scar, indicating that <b>he</b> <b>somehow</b> received it as a child.|$|E
2500|$|Oelph's account follows Vosill as she attends to the King regularly, {{as well as}} more {{charitable}} ministrations to {{the impoverished}} and those in need. [...] Her methods are unconventional by kingdom standards, for example forgoing the use of leeches and instead using alcohol to [...] " [...] the ill humours which can infect a wound," [...] but are more often than not successful. [...] This only serves to inspire more distrust amongst her detractors, notably including a number of Dukes as well as the King's Guard Commander, Adlain. On this topic, Oelph includes a transcript he claims to have found in Vosill's journal, purported to be an exchange between Duke Walen and Adlain in which they make an agreement, [...] "should it become necessary", to covertly kidnap the lady doctor and have Nolieti, the King's chief torturer, [...] "put her to the question." [...] Oelph notes that while the transcript appears to have been obtained under impossible circumstances, <b>he</b> <b>somehow</b> does not doubt its veracity.|$|E
2500|$|Sneakoscopes are {{introduced}} in Prisoner of Azkaban when Harry receives a pocket-sized version from Ron for his 13th birthday. Bill says that Pocket Sneakoscopes are unreliable, as it lit up and spun at dinner for apparently no reason, but Fred and George had put beetles in his soup without his knowledge. The sneakoscope appears {{again on the}} Hogwarts Express, and again in Harry and Ron's dormitory. Harry later discovers that Scabbers, Ron's rat, who is present each time the Sneakoscope is spinning, is actually Peter Pettigrew in Animagus form. In Goblet of Fire, the somewhat paranoid Moody has several sneakoscopes that <b>he</b> <b>somehow</b> disabled (possibly related to a crack it was described as having), claiming, [...] "It wouldn't stop whistling." [...] Moody was later revealed to actually be Barty Crouch, Jr. under {{the effects of the}} Polyjuice Potion, thus explaining the constant alerts in his presence. Finally in Deathly Hallows, Hermione gives Harry a Sneakoscope for his seventeenth birthday which they later use as a lookout while in hiding.|$|E

2500|$|... "Mok-qua Bennette was {{his real}} name. On {{the way to}} Beaver Bay in 1870 he spied a bear (named Mok-qua) sunning itself under a large spruce. Because of weather {{conditions}} - three feet of snow - {{it was impossible for}} the bear to move fast. The bear looked like good meat to the Indian who, unfortunately, didn't have a gun with him. He took a ten foot stick and attached a butcher knife to it thinking he would stab the bear to death. All he could do was tickle the bear. Seeing his method didn't work he cut a piece from a birch sapling with his tomahawk and tried to kill the bear by clubbing him to death. After the first blow he fell back while drawing away and got tangled in the limbs of the fallen tree. Mok-qua attacked the Indian, clawing his shoulder and arms. He did not bite him. The bear left the Indian who was unconscious. The Indian regained consciousness at night and when he did he was very sick and almost frozen. <b>He</b> <b>somehow</b> dragged himself to the farm of Jacob Hangarner who, after warming and feeding him, brough him to Beaver Bay. The Indian suffered more from exposure than from the attack." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gael García Bernal as Bartender/King of Ward 3, {{one of the}} film's villains. In {{defiance}} of the doctor's democratic efforts and election as leader of Ward 1, the bartender declares himself [...] "King of Ward 3" [...] and gains immediate popularity from his [...] "subjects" [...] by prioritizing food over his ward's community responsibilities such as burying the dead. <b>He</b> <b>somehow</b> obtains a revolver and uses it to bully the other wards by controlling the food supply. Meirelles followed the advice of Brazilian stage director Antunes Filho and changed the character from the novel by making him more ambiguous, explaining, [...] "In the book, he is really a mean guy, terribly evil from the beginning... but I thought it was more interesting to have him be not evil but more like {{a child with a}} gun." [...] Bernal described the result of his character, [...] "I think the King is just very practical, very pragmatic. He appears cold because he is not an idealist and does not see hope, but he is a survivor, the same as all the others." [...] The doctor's wife kills him with a pair of medical scissors to the neck. His death marks the point when Ward 1 takes back control, with the doctor's wife's threat to kill one of the men from Ward 3 for every day her ward goes without food.|$|E
2500|$|Phase 3: 1877, autumn: [...] The Chinese halted near Turfan {{for a few}} months, {{possibly}} to bring up supplies or avoid the summer heat. [...] The death of Yakub Beg had disorganized the rebels. There were various conflicts which need not be listed and no single leader arose to organize resistance. [...] In August an advance party left Turfan and the main body left on 27 September. [...] In early October Karashar and Korla were occupied. The rebels dammed the Kaidu River and flooded part of Karashar, but this did not stop the advance. Bayen Hu adopted a scorched earth policy, burning houses and crops and driving the people westward with his army. Kin Shun (Jin Shun) made a forced march and somewhere near Luntai sighted a mob, said to be some {{tens of thousands of}} people. [...] The rebel soldiers drew off from the civilians, a battle was fought and the Kashgaris fled to Kucha. When the Chinese reached Kucha they found the townspeople fighting the rebels, having no wish to accompany them westward. The Kashgaris fought the Chinese with some success, were defeated and fled, leaving 1000 dead on the battlefield. [...] A depot was set up at Kucha and some effort was made {{to clean up the mess}} left by Bayan Hu. By the end of October Chang Yao brought up the rear guard and the advance was resumed toward Aksu. [...] During this time, General Zuo with the main army had been inactive north of the mountains. <b>He</b> <b>somehow</b> crossed the Tien Shan and joined the advance. The Chinese now had so many men and the rebels had been defeated so many times that Aksu and Uqturpan surrendered without a fight. (The commander of Aksu abandoned his post, was captured by the rebels and executed.) [...] On 17 December Kashgar was easily taken. [...] Yarkand, [...] Khotan and other places then submitted.|$|E
