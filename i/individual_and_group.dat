Language classes are offered in Arabic literacy (because many of the trainees are illiterate), English, and French. In partnership with Search for Common Ground, the center educates the trainees on subjects such as life planning, empowerment, Nonviolent Communication, and reproductive health. Center staff help participants find employment with outside businesses upon graduation.|$|E

5|$|Very rarely, {{female worker}} bees lay eggs that escape worker policing, {{in a process}} known as the anarchic syndrome. Female {{reproductive}} workers in these colonies activate their ovaries even {{in the presence of a}} queen. The worker eggs are allowed as they mimic queen hydrocarbons. Thus, female workers can maximize their reproductive fitness at the expense of the colony. Anarchic syndrome is an example of selection working in opposite directions at <b>individual</b> <b>and</b> <b>group</b> levels.|$|E

Under federal law, all group health insurances plans for private companies with more than 50 employees must offer insurance coverage for alcoholism that is equal to their insurance coverage for other medical conditions.|$|E
5|$|Historian {{of science}} Thierry Bardini argues that Engelbart's complex {{personal}} philosophy (which drove all his research) foreshadowed the modern {{application of the}} concept of coevolution to the philosophy and use of technology. Bardini points out that Engelbart was strongly influenced by the principle of linguistic relativity developed by Benjamin Lee Whorf. Where Whorf reasoned that the sophistication of a language controls the sophistication of the thoughts that can be expressed by a speaker of that language, Engelbart reasoned that the state of our current technology controls our ability to manipulate information, and that fact in turn will control our ability to develop new, improved technologies. He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing computer-based technologies for manipulating information directly, and also to improve <b>individual</b> <b>and</b> <b>group</b> processes for knowledge-work.|$|E

5|$|Mainstream opinion {{reflects}} {{the function of}} identification with a sports team in both <b>individual</b> <b>and</b> <b>group</b> psychology. There are many benefits associated with sports fandom, both private (increased self-esteem) and public (community solidarity). The activity of viewing sporting events provide shared experiences that reinforce personal and group identification with a team. The name, mascot, cheerleaders, and marching band performances reinforce and become associated with these shared experiences. Daniel Snyder explicitly invokes these associations with family, friends, and an 81-year tradition as being the most important reasons for keeping the Redskins name. When self-esteem becomes bound to {{the players and the}} team, there are many beneficial but also some unfortunate consequences, including denial or rationalization of misbehavior. However, for some, the identity being expressed is one of supremacy, with the defense of native mascots clearly racist.|$|E

5|$|Theatre also greatly {{influenced}} Alejo Carpentier's work. In all his work, Carpentier uses the characters he creates {{to explore the}} notions of subjectivity and identity, analyzing {{the way in which}} individuals see themselves and others within cultural settings. In order to achieve such an analysis, Carpentier makes use of spectatorship: his characters perceive a spectacle in alterable ways which parallel their alterable ways of experiencing the world. Spectacle situations are also sometimes used by Carpentier as a tool for the characters to reframe and rethink the world, as well as to establish <b>individual</b> <b>and</b> <b>group</b> identity.|$|E
