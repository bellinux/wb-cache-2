5|$|According to the Government Proceedings Act, civil {{proceedings}} against the <b>Government</b> <b>must</b> be commenced against an appropriate authorized Government department.

5|$|The Government is {{responsible}} to the Croatian Parliament; the parliament may recall the Government as a whole or {{any member of the}} Government in particular by an absolute majority vote (majority of all MPs) following a request for a confidence vote by one fifth of the parliament members or by the prime minister. The prime minister {{and other members of the}} Government are jointly responsible for decisions passed by the Government and individually responsible for their respective portfolios (areas of responsibility). The President of the Republic appoints the prime minister, who must then secure a vote of confidence from the Croatian Parliament (majority of all MPs); the appointment is therefore counter-signed by the speaker of the parliament to signify this. Appointments of members of the Government are done by the prime minister with the approval of the Croatian Parliament (again signified via a counter-signature by the speaker of the parliament). The rules of procedure and regulations enacted by the <b>Government</b> <b>must</b> be published in Narodne Novine—the official gazette of Croatia—to be binding.|$|E
