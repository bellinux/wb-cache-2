5|$|Charles faced a {{political}} storm over his brother James, a Catholic, being {{next in line}} to the throne. The prospect of a Catholic monarch was vehemently opposed by Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury (previously Baron Ashley {{and a member of}} the Cabal, which had fallen apart in 1673). Shaftesbury's power base was strengthened when the House of Commons of 1679 introduced the <b>Exclusion</b> Bill, which sought to exclude the Duke of York from the line of succession. Some even sought to confer the Crown on the Protestant Duke of Monmouth, the eldest of Charles's illegitimate children. The Abhorrers—those who thought the <b>Exclusion</b> Bill was abhorrent—were named Tories (after a term for dispossessed Irish Catholic bandits), while the Petitioners—those who supported a petitioning campaign in favour of the <b>Exclusion</b> Bill—were called Whigs (after a term for rebellious Scottish Presbyterians).|$|E

5|$|Fearing {{that the}} <b>Exclusion</b> Bill would be passed, and bolstered by some acquittals in the {{continuing}} Plot trials, which seemed to him to indicate a more favourable public mood towards Catholicism, Charles dissolved the English Parliament, {{for a second time}} that year, in mid-1679. Charles's hopes for a more moderate Parliament were not fulfilled; within a few months he had dissolved Parliament yet again, after it sought to pass the <b>Exclusion</b> Bill. When a new Parliament assembled at Oxford in March 1681, Charles dissolved it for a fourth time after just a few days. During the 1680s, however, popular support for the <b>Exclusion</b> Bill ebbed, and Charles experienced a nationwide surge of loyalty. Lord Shaftesbury was prosecuted (albeit unsuccessfully) for treason in 1681 and later fled to Holland, where he died. For the remainder of his reign, Charles ruled without Parliament.|$|E

During the seizure, Serb forces injured a Ukrainian UNPROFOR peacekeeper. In response to the attack, the UN once again requested NATO air support. Two U.S. A-10 aircraft repeatedly strafed Serb targets, and the Serbs returned the seized weapons to the collection site.|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} to the avalanche of claims against attorneys, legal malpractice insurers have sought to limit their exposure. These insurers have followed the lead of insurers that issued directors 2 ̆ 7 and officers 2 ̆ 7 liability policies containing exclusionary provisions, {{commonly referred to as}} FDIC <b>exclusions</b> or regulatory <b>exclusions.</b> These policy provisions specifically excluded claims made by government regulators such as the FDIC and the now-defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC). Despite express exclusionary language in the directors 2 ̆ 7 and officers 2 ̆ 7 liability policies, the FDIC and FSLIC challenged the regulatory <b>exclusions.</b> The regulators claimed that the <b>exclusions</b> were unenforceable because they were contrary to public policy. A number of trial courts have ruled on the validity of regulatory <b>exclusions</b> under directors 2 ̆ 7 and officers 2 ̆ 7 liability policies. Some courts have been persuaded by the FDIC 2 ̆ 7 s myriad arguments and have declared that the regulatory <b>exclusions</b> are unenforceable because they contravene public policy. Other courts have held that no public policy abrogates the regulatory <b>exclusions.</b> To date, there has been no reported decision on regulatory <b>exclusions</b> in legal malpractice policies. Therefore, the only guidance on the enforceability of such <b>exclusions</b> is the case law on regulatory <b>exclusions</b> in directors 2 ̆ 7 and officers 2 ̆ 7 liability policies. After discussing the current case law and statutory developments affecting directors 2 ̆ 7 and officers 2 ̆ 7 liability policies, this article will consider the applicability of public policy arguments to legal malpractice policies. Finally, the article will discuss the consequences of judicial rewriting of the policies to both insured attorneys and their clients...|$|R

5|$|All of {{the forces}} in the {{universe}} are based on four fundamental interactions. The strong and weak forces are nuclear forces that act only at very short distances, and {{are responsible for the}} interactions between subatomic particles, including nucleons and compound nuclei. The electromagnetic force acts between electric charges, and the gravitational force acts between masses. All other forces in nature derive from these four fundamental interactions. For example, friction is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between the atoms of two surfaces, and the Pauli <b>exclusion</b> principle, which does not permit atoms to pass through each other. Similarly, the forces in springs, modeled by Hooke's law, are the result of electromagnetic forces and the <b>Exclusion</b> Principle acting together to return an object to its equilibrium position. Centrifugal forces are acceleration forces that arise simply from the acceleration of rotating frames of reference.|$|E
5|$|Embryos {{produced}} {{using in}} vitro fertilization may be genetically tested for HD using preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). This technique, where one or two cells are extracted from a typically 4- to 8-cell embryo and then tested for the genetic abnormality, can then be used to ensure embryos affected with HD genes are not implanted, and therefore any offspring will not inherit the disease. Some forms of preimplantation genetic diagnosis—non-disclosure or <b>exclusion</b> testing—allow at-risk people to have HD-free offspring without revealing their own parental genotype, giving no information about whether they themselves are destined to develop HD. In <b>exclusion</b> testing, the embryos' DNA is {{compared with that of}} the parents and grandparents to avoid inheritance of the chromosomal region containing the HD gene from the affected grandparent. In non-disclosure testing, only disease-free embryos are replaced in the uterus while the parental genotype and hence parental risk for HD are never disclosed.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} methodological quality of {{approaches}} to blind ing and to handling of <b>exclusions</b> {{as reported in}} randomised trials from one medical specialty. DESIGN: Survey of published, parallel group randomised controlled trials. DATA SOURCES: A random sample of 110 reports in which allocation was described as randomised from 1990 and 1991 volumes of four journals of obstetrics and gynaecology. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The adequacy of the descriptions of double blinding and <b>exclusions</b> after randomisation. RESULTS: Through 31 trials reported being double blind, about twice as many could have been. Of the 31 trials only eight (26 %) provided information on {{the protection of the}} allocation schedule and only five (16 %) provided some written assurance of successful implementation of double blinding. Of 38 trials in which the authors provided sufficient information for readers to infer that no <b>exclusions</b> after randomisation had occurred, six (16 %) reported adequate allocation concealment and none stated that an intention to treat analysis had been performed. That compared with 14 (27 %) and six (12 %), respectively, for the 52 trials that reported <b>exclusions.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Investigators could have double blinded more often. When they did double blind, they reported poorly and rarely evaluated it. Paradoxically, trials that reported <b>exclusions</b> seemed generally of a higher methodological standard than those that had no apparent <b>exclusions.</b> <b>Exclusions</b> from analysis may have been made in some of the trials in which no <b>exclusions</b> were reported. Editors and readers of reports of randomised trials should understand that flawed reporting of <b>exclusions</b> may often provide a misleading impression {{of the quality of the}} trial...|$|R

40|$|Languages {{based on}} logical {{variables}} can regard finite domains, finite <b>exclusions,</b> and, generally, types as values. Like a variable can be bound to a non-ground structure {{which can be}} later specialized through in-place assignment of some inner variables, {{it can also be}} bound to, say, a domain structure which can be specialized later through "in-place deletion" of some of its elements (e. g. by intersection with other domain structures). While finite domains prescribe the elements of a disjunctive structure, the complementary finite <b>exclusions</b> forbid the elements of a conjunctive structure. Domains and <b>exclusions</b> can be values of variables or occur inside clauses as/in terms or within an occurrence-binding construct (useful to name arbitrary terms). In a relational-functional language (e. g., RELFUN) they can also be returned as values of functions. Altogether, domains and <b>exclusions</b> become first-class citizens. Because they are completely handled by an extended unification routine, they do not require delay techniques needed in (more expressive) constraint systems. Still, their backtracking-superseding "closed" representation leads to smaller proof trees (efficiency), and abstracted, intensional answers (readability). Anti-unification (for generalization) exchanges the roles of domains and <b>exclusions.</b> The operational semantics of domains, <b>exclusions,</b> and occurrence bindings is specified by a RELFUN meta-unify function (and implemented in pure LISP) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to analyse <b>exclusions</b> and {{exceptions}} from patentability which is a negative requirement for an invention to enjoy a patent protection. It aims {{to answer the question}} why the <b>exclusions</b> are needed and whether they should be preserved as some of them proved to be very controversial. The law and practice of the European Patent Office, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom are compared with the emphasis on the European Patent Convention and the EPO's case law. In the national regulation, mainly the differences and peculiarities to the European approach are pointed out. The work is composed of four chapters. The first chapter explains the basic concepts of patent law and presents justifications for patent protection. The second chapter deals with various patent systems and reviews the most important international tools of harmonization. In the third chapter, the <b>exclusions</b> are introduced and the distinction between Article 52 (2) and (3) EPC (<b>exclusions)</b> and Article 53 (exceptions) is clarified whereas it is submitted that the difficulty posed by the <b>exclusions</b> lies in the interpretation of the words "as such" used in Article 52 (3) EPC.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has found that the items that are included in GAAP earnings but excluded from Street earnings to allow the firm to meet or beat analyst earnings forecasts (“MBF exclusions”) are more persistent than the other excluded items. In this study, I find that the difference in the levels of persistence between MBF and non-MBF <b>exclusions</b> declined after the introduction of Regulation G, which requires public companies that disclose non-GAAP earnings to also present GAAP earnings and a reconciliation of the two. Analysts underestimate the persistence of non-MBF <b>exclusions,</b> but the degree of this underestimation is lower in the post-regulation period. In contrast, there is little evidence to indicate that analysts underestimate the persistence of MBF <b>exclusions</b> in either time period. I also find strong (weak) evidence that investors underestimate the persistence of Street <b>exclusions</b> in the pre- (post-) regulation period. These results suggest that Regulation G constrains the practice of excluding recurring expenses from Street earnings to meet or beat analyst forecasts and helps analysts and investors to understand the persistence of Street <b>exclusions...</b>|$|R
