5|$|West {{has been}} {{mentioned}} in several polls of MLB players. In 2006, the spring after he was crew chief in the World Series, a Sports Illustrated survey asked 470 MLB players to identify {{the best and worst}} umpires. West was identified as the best MLB umpire by 2 percent of those players, ranking him ninth on that list. With respect to the worst umpire, 6 percent of players <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> selected West. Only three umpires were named more frequently as worst umpire <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey.</b> A 2007 review of umpire strike zones by The Hardball Times determined that West was the most consistent umpire in the major leagues.|$|E
5|$|Despite the orders, a {{relatively}} small number of people evacuated for the hurricane. According to a telephone survey conducted by the United States Department of Commerce, the highest participation rate was for residents in the Northern Neck in areas potentially affected by the storm surge from a Category2 hurricane, of which 41% <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> stated they left their houses for a safer location. In Surry, only 9% of those in a Category2 hurricane storm surge zone left. 30% who participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> along the Eastern Shore left. The primary reasons for the choice whether to evacuate or not were due to the track of Isabel, its strength, or influence from the media. Most participants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> stated they did not hear any sort of evacuation notice from public officials in their location, however. Of those who evacuated, about 64% left for the house of a friend or a relative, with about 24% evacuating to a hotel or a motel. Most of those in Hampton and Norfolk left for elsewhere in the state, while the majority of those in the Northern Neck evacuated to destinations in their own neighborhood or community. The evacuation destinations on the Eastern Shore of Virginia were varied, with 23% leaving for Maryland and 46% staying in their own neighborhood or community. The length of the evacuation process varied between a few hours to two days, with the worst evacuation problems being closed or flooded roads. The Virginia Army National Guard and State Police troopers assisted in the evacuations. In all, more than 160,000 residents in southeastern Virginia were told to evacuate, including 11,000 in vulnerable locations along the Chesapeake Bay and all residents in mobile home parks in Chesapeake and Newport News. A total of about 16,325people evacuated to 67 shelters. Some of the reported problems were shortages of supplies, unanticipated medical issues, overcrowding, and lack of security.|$|E

5|$|A {{survey in}} 2012 {{revealed}} that passengers who used Metrolink everyday for commuting rated service levels as poor and/or unreliable, with those respondents particularly frustrated by delays and disruptions. TfGM recognised {{that the older}} vehicles in its fleet – the T68/T68As — were outdated {{and the cause of}} much disruption, and agreed to replace them with M5000s by 2014. Among those who used Metrolink less regularly, the system scored far better <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey.</b> A survey in 2013 by the non-departmental government body Passenger Focus found that of the five major light rail systems in the United Kingdom – Metrolink, Sheffield Supertram, NET, Midland Metro and Blackpool tramway – Metrolink had the lowest overall satisfaction rating in the United Kingdom. Respondents were surveyed on value for money, punctuality, seating availability, tram stops and overall satisfaction. Metrolink was below average on all criteria, and 47% believed Metrolink was value for money compared to a national average of 60%.|$|E
5|$|According to the Abingdon Chronicle, Oxford Castle {{was built}} by the Norman baron Robert D'Oyly the elder from 1071–73. D'Oyly had arrived in England with William I in the Norman Conquest of England in 1066 and William the Conqueror granted him {{extensive}} lands in Oxfordshire. Oxford had been stormed in the invasion with considerable damage, and William directed D'Oyly to build a castle to dominate the town. In due course D'Oyly became the foremost landowner in Oxfordshire and was confirmed with a hereditary royal constableship for Oxford Castle. Oxford Castle is not among the 48 recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, but not every castle in existence {{at the time was}} recorded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey.</b>|$|E

5|$|According to the Domesday Book of 1086, the Bishop of Rochester {{was given}} land valued at 17s 4d in Aylesford, Kent, in {{compensation}} for land {{that became the}} site of Rochester Castle. Of the 48castles mentioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey,</b> Rochester {{is the only one}} for which property-owners were reimbursed when their land was taken to build the castle. From the 11thcentury the castle-guard was a feudal obligation in England. This often took the form of knights garrisoning castles for their lords for a set period. There is no comprehensive list of which castles were owed service in this form, but military historian Cathcart King notes that they seem to have been predominantly high-status castles. Rochester's castle-guard consisted of 60knights' fees, marking it as a particularly important fortification.|$|E
5|$|Bentworth was {{the largest}} parish within the Hundred of Odiham, after Odiham itself. At {{the time of the}} Domesday Survey the area of the Hundred of Odiham were {{included}} in two separate hundreds, Odiham and Hefedele (also known as Edefele and Efedele). The former comprised Lasham and Shalden and half a hide which had been taken from the nearby village of Preston Candover, and the latter included Odiham, Winchfield, Elvetham, Dogmersfield, and a former parish named Berchelei. For the manors of Bentworth, Greywell, Hartley Wintney, Liss, Sherfield-upon-Loddon, and Weston Patrick, there are no entries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Survey,</b> but they were believed to have been included in the large manor of Odiham.|$|E

5|$|M-221 is {{maintained}} by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2009 showed that the traffic levels along M-221 were 2,940vehicles daily north of the junction with 7½Mile Road and 1,476vehicles per day south of the intersection; along the whole highway, 26trucks were recorded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey.</b> No sections of M-221 have been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bird species}} {{including}} treepies, bulbuls, babblers, mynahs and crows were noted. In 2010, {{the first ever}} bird survey was conducted in the Sathyamangalam forests. A total of 230 species of birds were recorded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey.</b> In 2010, a small population of critically endangered Indian vulture (Gyps indicus) and three other species of vultures were discovered to be thriving in the Moyar river valley. 20 nests were sighted and the population was estimated to consist up of 40 adults. Last sighted in {{the region in the}} 1970s, the rediscovery of the vulture, a bird rapidly disappearing from India, has been significant. Diclofenac, which caused the decline of vulture population was banned in 2006 and since then, vulture numbers have started to grow back.|$|E
5|$|The {{survey showed}} that the breeds suffer from similar rates of ongoing health conditions, with one exception. Whereas {{more than a quarter}} of Pembroke Welsh Corgis {{surveyed}} suffered from some type of eye condition, only 6.1% of the Cardigan Corgis did. Eye conditions typical in the Corgi breeds include progressive retinal atrophy, which occurs more often in dogs over six years of age, and canine glaucoma, which again is more common in older dogs. Similar percentages <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> were seen in both breeds for issues relating to reproduction, such as requiring caesarian sections and having false pregnancies. Further similarities were also seen related to musculoskelatal issues, including arthritis. However, Hip dysplasia, common in some types of dogs, is rare in the Corgi breeds.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a {{methodology}} for identifying a population group <b>surveyed</b> latently <b>in</b> <b>the</b> (target) <b>survey</b> relevant for further processing, for example poverty calculations, but surveyed explicitly in another (source) survey, {{not suitable for}} such processing. Identification is achieved by transferring the binary information from <b>the</b> source <b>survey</b> to <b>the</b> target <b>survey</b> {{by means of a}} logistic regression determining group affiliation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> source <b>survey</b> by use of variables available also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> target <b>survey.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> proposed methodology we improve on common matching procedures by optimizing the cut-value of the probability which assigns group affiliation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> target <b>survey.</b> This contrasts with the commonly used "Hosmer-Lemeshov" cut-values for binary categorization, which equates between the sensitivity and specificity curves. Instead we improve group identification by minimizing the sum of total errors as a percent of total true outcomes. The Jewish ultra-orthodox population in Israel serves as a case study. This idiosyncratic community, committed to the observance of the Bible is only latently observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>surveys</b> typically used for poverty calculation. It is explicitly captured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> social <b>survey,</b> which is not suitable for poverty measurement. This procedure is useful for ex-post enhancement of survey data in general.

5|$|Urse {{earned a}} {{reputation}} for extortion and financial exactions. During the reign of William II, he was considered {{second only to the}} king's minister Ranulf Flambard in his rapacity. The first mention of his exactions is in Hemming's Cartulary. Further details were given by the medieval chroniclers William of Malmesbury and Gerald of Wales, both of whom relate Ealdred's curse. His exactions were also mentioned in Domesday Book, where an entry <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> for Gloucestershire noted that his oppression prevented the inhabitants of Sodbury so much that they were unable to pay their customary rents. He intimidated the monks of the Worcester cathedral chapter into granting him a lease of two of their estates, Greenhill and Eastbury. Urse was one of a new breed of royal official, one who was not opposed to royal power but rather welcomed it, as it helped his own position.|$|E
5|$|Đurišić {{maintained}} {{contact with}} Lukačević, who {{at that time}} had begun to attack the Germans in Herzegovina with his own forces. Đurišić considered the possibility of joining Lukačević in fighting the Germans in anticipation of an Allied landing. However, because Lukačević was quickly defeated and no Allied landing occurred, Đurišić remained tied to the Germans. German intelligence closely tracked Đurišić's communications and movements, and German commands continued {{to make use of}} his forces. The Germans counted Đurišić's Chetniks as part of Army Group E in a survey of available forces dated 16 November 1944. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey,</b> German forces in Montenegro at that time were estimated at 47,000 soldiers, including Đurišić's 10,000 Chetniks. On 21 October 1944, the Partisans took the Grahovo garrison after a five-day battle. On 6 November, the Partisans surrounded Cetinje, which was defended by the Germans, Black Shirts, and about 600 Chetniks. On 8 November, the Germans and Chetniks in Cetinje were reinforced with a formation of 800–1,000 Chetniks led by Đurišić, which eventually succeeded in breaking through the Partisan blockade.|$|E
5|$|At Marsh's urging, Powell {{pushed for}} Cope to return {{specimens}} he had unearthed during his employment under the government surveys. This was an outrage to Cope, {{who had used}} his own money {{while working as a}} volunteer. In response, Cope went to the editor of the New York Herald and promised a scandalous headline. Since 1885, Cope had kept an elaborate journal of mistakes and misdeeds that both Marsh and Powell had committed over the years. From scientific errors to publishing mistakes, he had them written down in a journal he kept in the bottom drawer of his Pine Street desk. Cope sought out Marsh's assistants, who complained of being denied access and credit by their employer and of being chronically underpaid. Reporter William Hosea Ballou ran the first article on January 12, 1890, in what would become a series of newspaper debates between Marsh, Powell, and Cope. Cope attacked Marsh for plagiarism and financial mismanagement, and attacked Powell for his geological classification errors and misspending of government-allocated funds. Marsh and Powell published their own side of the story and, in the end, little changed. No congressional hearing was created to investigate Powell's alleged misallocation of funds, while Cope and Marsh were not held responsible for any mistakes. Indirectly, however, the attacks may have been influential in Marsh's fall from power <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey.</b> Due to pressure from Powell over bad press, Marsh was removed from his position for the government surveys. Cope's relations {{with the president of the}} University of Pennsylvania soured, and the entire funding for paleontology in the government surveys was pulled.|$|E
