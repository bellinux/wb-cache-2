50|$|Although {{a canopy}} which {{provided}} clear vision {{to the rear}} necessary for dogfighting like the F-86 was designed, production MiG-17Fs got a cheaper rear-view periscope which would still appear on Soviet fighters {{as late as the}} MiG-23. By 1953, pilots got safer ejection seats with protective <b>face</b> <b>curtain</b> and leg restraints like the Martin-Baker seats in the west. The MiG-15 had suffered for its lack of a radar gunsight, but in 1951, Soviet engineers obtained a captured F-86 Sabre from Korea and they copied the optical gunsight and SRD-3 gun ranging radar to produce the ASP-4N gunsight and SRC-3 radar. The combination would prove deadly over the skies of Vietnam against aircraft such as the F-4 Phantom whose pilots lamented that guns and radar gunsights had been omitted as obsolescent.|$|E

40|$|Five {{different}} trellis {{and training}} systems were compared in {{their effect on}} yield components, fruit composition, fruit set, and shoot morphology in Pinot noir grapevines. The treatments were: upright vertical, cane pruned (Guyot); upright vertical, spur pruned (Bi-lateral Cordon); Scott Henry, cane pruned; Lyre, cane pruned; and Geneva Double Curtain (GDC), cane pruned. The GDC and the Scott Henry had the highest yield, but {{were not significantly different}} from the Lyre or Bi-lateral Cordon. The double curtain trellis systems had the most clusters per shoot. Vines trained to the GDC had the highest cluster weight. The GDC and Scott Henry had the most berries per cluster. The single curtain trellis systems had more shoots per square meter than the double curtain systems. There {{were no significant differences in}} must soluble solids, pK or titratable acidity among the different trellis systems. The double canopy trellis systems were also evaluated by canopy to determine differences within the vine. There were no significant differences in yield components between double canopies within the vine. The north <b>facing</b> <b>curtain</b> in both the GDC and the Lyre had longer mean shoot length. The north <b>facing</b> <b>curtain</b> in the GDC also had higher percentage main shoot leaf area, while the south <b>facing</b> <b>curtain</b> had higher percent lateral shoot leaf area...|$|R

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{experimental study}} has been conducted using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) for {{a wide array of}} ventilation schemes and mining configurations for the purpose of examining ventilation characteristics in dead end mine headings. Flow behaviors in two basic mining sequences of box and slab cuts for 30 ft and 60 ft deep cuts were studied. The present thesis discusses the effect for various geometric and flow parameters including the variation of inlet flow velocities, entry heights, face zone widths and curtain widths on the flow behavior. The Reynolds number Re considered for this study ranges from 1 · 105 to 3 · 106 based on curtain width and exit velocity. The variation of the face zone and the curtain widths considerably affected the flow behavior, resulting in recirculation regions in the face area for critical combinations. Jet spreading angles and virtual origins have been calculated for the different geometries showing that an optimum range of <b>face</b> and <b>curtain</b> widths exists. A detailed discussion employing various scenarios for exhaust ventilation systems has also been made. Full-size measurements and comparison of the experimental data with numerical simulations is presented. Implementation of machine-mounted scrubbers in the blowing system are discussed for different values of the ventilation ratios (Qs/Qin) ranging from 14 % to 53 %. The scrubber system, typically introduced for dust collection, is also shown to be a useful tool in providing adequate ventilation to the immediate face area...|$|R
50|$|The fortifications are Vauban's final {{work and}} the {{culmination}} of his 'Third System'. There are two lines of defence, an inner enceinte de sûreté, the bastion wall around the city, and an outer enceinte de combat, a system of concentric star-shaped earthworks. The curtain wall was largely octagonal, with each flank separated roughly into three and the outer bastion projecting slightly, so as to flank {{the centre of the}} walls. Each corner had a raised outwardly projecting pentagonal bastion tower, the highest points of the system. The outer earthworks were deep and occupied a greater area than the city itself. The inner walls were surrounded by tenailles before the centres of the curtain walls and counterguards before the bastions. In front of the centre of each <b>curtain</b> <b>face</b> was a large tetrahedral ravelin, those in front of the gateways also being topped by a reduit to the rear. Outside all of these earthworks was a covered way.|$|R

Next, Lucky opens the door to reveal a handsome man, who then takes her in his arms, as the director yells [...] "Cut! We've got it". Lucky then walks off-set into the studio, replying to the director: [...] "Finally! We've done it fifty-million times!"

Several bottles were scattered over it. At the head of it, and facing us, there sat a huge man with a lion-like head and a great shock of orange-coloured hair. His beard was of the same glaring hue; matted and tangled and coarse as a horse's mane. I have seen some strange faces in my time, but never one more brutal than that, with its small, vicious, blue eyes, its white, crumpled cheeks, and the thick, hanging lip which protruded over his monstrous beard.

He had been pruning the grape vine. He {{had never had a}} ladder long enough to reach the sill of the third-floor windows--at house-painting times he had borrowed one from the plumber who mixed his paint--and he had in his own happy-go-lucky way contrived a combination of the garden fruit ladder with a battered kitchen table that served all sorts of odd purposes in an outhouse. He had stayed up this arrangement by means of the garden roller, and the roller had at the critical moment--rolled. He was lying close by the garden door with his head queerly bent back against a broken and twisted rainwater pipe, an expression of pacific contentment on his <b>face,</b> a bamboo <b>curtain</b> rod with a tableknife tied to end of it, still gripped in his hand. We had been rapping for some time at the front door unable to make him hear, and then we came round by the door in the side trellis into the garden and so discovered him.|$|R
40|$|In years 1980 the “brutalist” and “monumentalist” {{architecture}} went even in Italy, and in Potenza, and {{it finds}} some interesting examples, {{such as the}} building designed {{as the home of}} the Mediterranean Bank. A monumental building, all in reinforced <b>facing</b> concrete and <b>curtain</b> walls, with refined proportional relationships, and so devoid of insulation (annual heat demand of 69 kWh/m 3 year), that its management has become unbearable from the economic point of view, so it was abandoned a few years ago. Aim of this work was to define a de-sign methodology that preserve all the qualities of architecture, but at a cost that is economically bearable and made the building energetically efficient. This was done by allying a very thick and efficient isolation, protected by a ventilated con-tinues rainscreen, finished with several layers of a thin plaster with a bèton-like ef-fect, which determines a morphology that, while different, recalls the original. The curtain walls were doubled with a double skin façade, whose performance has been optimized with a purpose created software. The huge skylight roof of the in-terior atrium has been doubled with a new, of different trend and thermally more effective. The roof was covered with photovoltaic panels. The result is an annual heat and refrigeration demand of 17 kWh/m 3 year, at a cost of 200, 00 €/m 2, quickly depreciating, due to savings in operating costs for air conditioning (from € 104, 800. 00 to € 14, 700. 00 per year) ...|$|R
5000|$|Firestopping at the [...] "perimeter slab edge", {{which is}} {{a gap between the}} floor and the backpan of the curtain wall is {{essential}} to slow the passage of fire and combustion gases between floors. Spandrel areas must have non-combustible insulation at the interior <b>face</b> of the <b>curtain</b> wall. Some building codes require the mullion to be wrapped in heat-retarding insulation near the ceiling to prevent the mullions from melting and spreading the fire to the floor above. It {{is important to note that}} the firestop at the perimeter slab edge is considered a continuation of the fire-resistance rating of the floor slab. The curtain wall itself, however, is not ordinarily required to have a rating. This causes a quandary as Compartmentalization (fire protection) is typically based upon closed compartments to avoid fire and smoke migrations beyond each engaged compartment. A curtain wall by its very nature prevents the completion of the compartment (or envelope). The use of fire sprinklers has been shown to mitigate this matter. As such, unless the building is sprinklered, fire may still travel up the curtain wall, if the glass on the exposed floor is shattered due to fire influence, causing flames to lick up the outside of the building. Falling glass can endanger pedestrians, firefighters and firehoses below. An example of this is the 1988 First Interstate Tower fire in Los Angeles, California. The fire here leapfrogged up the tower by shattering the glass and then consuming the aluminium skeleton holding the glass. Aluminium's melting temperature is 660 °C, whereas building fires can reach 1,100 °C. The melting point of aluminium is typically reached within minutes of the start of a fire. Firestops for such building joints can be qualified to UL 2079 -- Tests for Fire Resistance of Building Joint Systems. Sprinklering of each floor has a profoundly positive effect on the fire safety of buildings with curtain walls.|$|R
