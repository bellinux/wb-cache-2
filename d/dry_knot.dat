6000|$|The {{news of this}} {{disaster}} came {{to him as he}} sat at his desk--the morning papers had given no hint of it. [...] "I don't believe it," [...] he said, quietly, and began pressing the buttons of his desk with the same swift calmness he would have used had the markets been going against him. Messages flew to and fro, the wires pulsed with his imperious anxiety. The manager of the steamboat company answered--denied. The news was confirmed, all to the same end; and when Simeon Pratt rose from his desk that night his jaw hung lax, his big form stooped and shambled as though twenty additional years had suddenly been heaped upon his shoulders. He went back to his splendid, lonely palace (where the servants huddled and whispered and hastened) with a hard, <b>dry</b> <b>knot</b> in his throat, and with eyes heavy and hot and tearless confronted his ruined altar. From one to be feared he had fallen in a day to the most desolate of beings.|$|E
30|$|Information about people’s {{preferences}} as to {{wood products}} {{is of relevance}} to several decision makers in the forest sector. Studies revealing consumer preference provide {{information that can be}} used for marketing and manufacturing of wood products, but these also provide information of relevance to designers and decision makers involved in building design and construction processes. Previous studies show that the overall harmony of the visual surface is correlated with preference. In this study, perceived visual homogeneity is modeled for five copper-impregnated and five organic biocide-impregnated decking materials with different visual quality. The models are based on visual variables. Homogeneity is a function of material-dependent variables (<b>dry</b> <b>knots,</b> knot shape, and splay knot), production-dependent variables (stain), and surplus color, which is a combination of both wood property and treatment. The results imply that homogeneity is influenced by both wood properties and treatment. Producers of decking should, while maintaining a focus on using high-quality raw material, also focus on producing a product with an unstained appearance.|$|R
50|$|Relative knot strength, {{also called}} knot efficiency, is the {{breaking}} {{strength of a}} knotted rope {{in proportion to the}} breaking strength of the rope without the knot. Determining a precise value for a particular knot is difficult because many factors can affect a knot efficiency test: the type of fiber, the style of rope, the size of rope, whether it is wet or <b>dry,</b> how the <b>knot</b> is dressed before loading, how rapidly it is loaded, whether the knot is repeatedly loaded, and so on. The efficiency of common knots ranges between 40—80% of the rope's original strength.|$|R
6000|$|Clarke {{was truly}} in a pitiable state of {{incertitude}} and despair. His oration, his interdicted challenge, his book, his religion were all swallowed {{in by the}} one great passion which now flooded and filled his brain--his love for Viola. [...] "She belongs to me," [...] he repeated, as he walked his room with shaking limbs, a <b>dry,</b> hard <b>knot</b> in his throat, his eyes hot with tears that would not fall. [...] "She must surrender herself to me--finally and now--to-day, I will wait no longer. She must leave this house at once--but she must go as my wife! She is right. Pratt is a beast--a savage. He will rage--he will vilify us both, but we will defy him. Our 'guides' will confound him. We are, after all, not dependent upon him. We can go on--" [...] The maid, returning, handed him Viola's answer and went hastily out. He read it and reread it till its finality burned into his brain, then dropped into a deep chair and there lay {{for a long time}} in despairing stupor.|$|R
40|$|X-ray {{computed}} tomography (CT) of logs means possibilities for optimizing breakdown in sawmills. This depends on accurate detection of knots to assess internal quality. However, as logs {{are stored in}} the log yard they dry to a certain extent, and this drying affects the density variation in the log, and therefore the X-ray images. For this reason, it is hypothetically difficult to detect log features in partially dried logs using X-ray CT. The objective {{of this research was}} to investigate the effect of <b>drying</b> on <b>knot</b> detection in Jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) and white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) logs from New Brunswick, Canada. An automatic knot detection algorithm was compared to manual measurements for this purpose, and the results show that knot detection was clearly affected by partial drying. Because dried heartwood and sapwood have similar densities, the algorithm had difficulties detecting the heartwood-sapwood border. Based on how well the heartwood-sapwood border was detected, it was statistically possible to sort logs into two groups: 1) Low knot detection rate, and 2) High knot detection rate. In that way, a decision can be made whether or not to trust the knot models obtained from CT scanning. Therefore, logs that are partially dried out and fall in the low knot detection rate should be handled cautiously because the optimization results based on CT knot detection cannot be fully trusted. Sawing of these logs could be optimized using only their outer shape, ignoring internal quality. Similarly, only logs having a regular heartwood shape should be used when scanning logs for research purposes or in databases of CT scanned logs. Finally, a larger knot detection rate was obtained for Jack pine. This could have been facilitated by the fact that pine trees usually have larger but less numerous knots than spruce trees...|$|R
