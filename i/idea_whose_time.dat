2500|$|As {{complaints}} about the city subway's delays and disrepair reached a fever pitch in summer 2017 under state governor Andrew Cuomo, he drafted a congestion pricing proposal with lessons from Bloomberg's handling of the State Legislature. Despite having earlier doubted such a plan's viability, Cuomo described congestion pricing as [...] "an <b>idea</b> <b>whose</b> <b>time</b> has come". London and Stockholm had implemented the concept successfully. Cuomo's plan is expected to differ significantly from Bloomberg's proposal. Its primary intent is {{to raise funds for}} city transit and reduce street gridlock, while balancing suburban commuter considerations. The New York Times reflected that Bloomberg's 2008 proposal, which would have raised $500 million annually, could have rectified infrastructure issues and emergency repair schedule affecting the subway in 2017. The plan could be implemented through open road tolling, which records E-ZPass transponders and license plates without forcing the vehicles to slow down significantly, thus increasing vehicle throughput. This would coincide with MTA Bridges and Tunnels' ongoing project to convert all of its crossings from a tollbooth-based system to an open road tolling system. This was in contrast to the circumstances during Bloomberg's tenure, when open road tolling was not widely used yet. As with the Bloomberg proposal, Queens politicians still opposed Cuomo's proposal because it would potentially add tolls to the remaining free crossings over the East River.|$|E

5000|$|Craig calls {{property}} simplicity [...] "philosophically and theologically unacceptable." [...] He also {{states that}} divine simplicity {{is open to}} powerful objections. On the doctrine of divine simplicity, God is absolutely similar in all possible worlds. Since the statement [...] "God knows x" [...] is equivalent to [...] "x is true," [...] it becomes inexplicable why those worlds vary if in every one God knows, loves, and wills the same things. Morris states {{that it is an}} <b>idea</b> <b>whose</b> implications are difficult to defend and whose advantages can be had in other ways. It is also an <b>idea</b> <b>whose</b> motivation, under close scrutiny, is not so convincing. John S. Feinberg concludes: [...] "These philosophical problems plus the biblical considerations raised earlier lead me to conclude that simplicity {{is not one of the}} divine attributes. This doesn't mean that God has physical parts, but that the implications of the doctrine of metaphysical simplicity are too problematic to maintain the doctrine." ...|$|R
