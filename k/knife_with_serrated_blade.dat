5000|$|A {{grapefruit}} knife is {{a special}} type of knife designed specifically for cutting grapefruit. Grapefruit <b>knives</b> are small <b>with</b> a curved <b>serrated</b> <b>blade,</b> designed to hug the curves of the grapefruit. This is used to separate {{the outer edge of}} the segments from the rim of the fruit. The term [...] "grapefruit knife" [...] can refer to a type of <b>knife</b> <b>with</b> short, <b>serrated</b> twin <b>blades</b> about 2mm apart, used to separate the sides of each section from the dividing membrane. Some grapefruit knives incorporate both types, a double-sided curved blade on one side and the parallel twin blades on the other. Another type includes an angled tip and double sided <b>serrated</b> <b>blade.</b> When both types are used, the result is an intact-looking fruit with sections which lift out easily - especially if a [...] "grapefruit spoon" [...] is used.|$|R

50|$|Saw Blades - A popular {{weapon in}} the early years of robotic combat, these robots use a {{dedicated}} motor to power either a modified chainsaw or circular saw, or a custom-built cutting disc, usually at high speeds (up to 10,000 RPM). The <b>serrated</b> <b>blade</b> is used to slice through an opponent's armour to try and reach its internal components. These weapons can create spectacular showers of sparks, and are easy to combine with other designs, but can be ineffective against robots with tougher armour. The aforementioned Robot Wars champion Roadblock had a rear-mounted circular saw in addition to its wedge, while Series 4 runner-up Pussycat had a custom cutting disc <b>with</b> four <b>serrated</b> <b>blades.</b>|$|R

40|$|Changes {{of shape}} {{dimension}} and component part of impeller might change of characteristic fluid flow so that pressure static in the fan housing changed. Changing some geometric {{characteristics of the}} centrifugal fan has more efficiency taking with energy crises into consideration. Several factors that can affect fan performance namely design and type size rotation speed air condition or gas through a fan operating point {{on the nature of}} the relationship between a volume of air flow and pressure. The purpose of this research was to test of fan performance of the modified centrifugal fan <b>with</b> the <b>serrated</b> <b>blade</b> impeller. The addition of a percentage of closing the inlet causes the air volumetric rate the airflow energy BHP and total efficiency except for the fan total and static pressure. The experimental test results there are static pressure data and the resulting total pressure is different or distorted 10 - 17 of deviation from calculation data based on the fan laws. This is possible because of changes in the shape of the <b>blade</b> <b>with</b> <b>serrated</b> on the inside of the impeller. Based on the performance curve shows that the selection of impeller speeds of 800 RPM produces a relatively high air volumetric rate is proportional to the total pressure of the fan and the flow energy so that it is more efficient than other impeller speeds...|$|R

40|$|A {{scale model}} of the bypass flow region of a 1. 5 {{pressure}} ratio, single stage, low tip speed fan was tested <b>with</b> a <b>serrated</b> rotor leading edge to determine its effects on noise generation.

Acoustic results indicate the serrations reduced front quadrant PNL's at takeoff power. In particular, the 200 foot (61. 0 m) sideline noise was reduced from 3 to 4 PNdb at 40 deg for nominal and large nozzle operation. However, the rear quadrant maximum sideline PNL's were increased 1. 5 to 3 PNdb at approach thust and up to 2 PNdb at takeoff thust <b>with</b> these <b>serrated</b> rotor <b>blades.</b> The configuration <b>with</b> the <b>serrated</b> rotor produced the lowest maximum 200 foot (61. 0 m) sideline PNL for any given thust when the large nozzle (116 % of design area) was employed...|$|R

50|$|Human uses of {{serration}} have copied, {{and gone}} beyond, {{those found in}} nature. For example, the teeth on a saw or other <b>serrated</b> <b>blade</b> serves a similar cutting or scraping purpose as the serration of an animal tooth. Tailors use pinking shears to cut cloth <b>with</b> a <b>serrated</b> edge, which, somewhat counterintuitively, reduces fraying by reducing {{the average length of}} a thread that may be pulled from the edge. A type of serration is also found in airframe shapes used in certain stealth aircraft, which use the jaggedness of the serrated edge to deflect radar signals from seams and edges where a straight, non-serrated edge would reflect radar signals back to the source. Screw threads show serration in profile, although they are usually shown in abbreviated or symbolic fashion on mechanical drawings to save time and ink. Brogue shoes are made <b>with</b> <b>serrated</b> edges on the leather pieces, for no known purpose at all other than style. The step clamp and step block assembly in metalworking adopt serration for the purpose of applying clamping pressure from an adjustable position.|$|R
