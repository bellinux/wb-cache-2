Explanations provide many benefits, from im-proving user satisfaction to helping users make better deci-sions. This paper introduces tagsplanations, which are ex-planations based on community tags. Tagsplanations have two key components: tag relevance, {{the degree to}} which a tag describes an item, and tag preference, the userâ€™s senti-ment toward a tag. We develop novel algorithms for esti-mating tag relevance and tag preference, and we conduct a user study exploring the roles <b>of</b> <b>tag</b> relevance and tag prefer-ence in promoting effective tagsplanations.

30|$|To find a {{semantic}} structure for timbre analysis based on social <b>tags,</b> a sample <b>of</b> music {{and its associated}} tags were taken.

This filtering left us with five such categories, namely adjectives, nouns, instruments, temporal references and verbs (see Appendix A for a detailed <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> the filtering process). Finally, the relations between different combinations <b>of</b> <b>tags</b> were analysed by means of distance calculations and hybrid clustering.|$|R

In the former case, this means that users are adding distinct tags to the LOs of the repository, whereas in the latter case the users are reusing tags that are relatively not popular in the social tagging system.

40|$|Abstract Background Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are {{the most}} common type of polymorphisms found in the human genome. Effective genetic {{association}} studies require the identification <b>of</b> sets <b>of</b> <b>tag</b> SNPs that capture as much haplotype information as possible. Tag SNP selection is analogous to the problem of data compression in information theory. According to Shannon's framework, the optimal tag set maximizes the entropy <b>of</b> the <b>tag</b> SNPs subject to constraints on the number of SNPs. This approach requires an appropriate probabilistic model. Compared to simple measures of Linkage Disequilibrium (LD), a good model of haplotype sequences can more accurately account for LD structure. It also provides a machinery for the prediction <b>of</b> <b>tagged</b> SNPs and thereby to assess the performances <b>of</b> <b>tag</b> sets through their ability to predict larger SNP sets. Results Here, we compute the description code-lengths of SNP data for an array of models and we develop tag SNP selection methods based on these models and the strategy of entropy maximization. Using data sets from the HapMap and ENCODE projects, we show that the hidden Markov model introduced by Li and Stephens outperforms the other models in several aspects: description code-length of SNP data, information content <b>of</b> <b>tag</b> sets, and prediction <b>of</b> <b>tagged</b> SNPs. This is the first use of this model in the context <b>of</b> <b>tag</b> SNP selection. Conclusion Our study provides strong evidence that the tag sets selected by our best method, based on Li and Stephens model, outperform those chosen by several existing methods. The results also suggest that information content evaluated with a good model is more sensitive for assessing the quality <b>of</b> a <b>tagging</b> set than the correct prediction rate <b>of</b> <b>tagged</b> SNPs. Besides, we show that haplotype phase uncertainty has an almost negligible impact on the ability <b>of</b> good <b>tag</b> sets to predict tagged SNPs. This justifies the selection <b>of</b> <b>tag</b> SNPs on the basis of haplotype informativeness, although genotyping studies do not directly assess haplotypes. A software that implements our approach is available. </p...|$|R
