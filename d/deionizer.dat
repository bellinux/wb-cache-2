A Special Analysis was completed which removes the air pathway {sup 14 }C limit from the Intermediate Level Vault (ILV). This analysis will allow the disposal of reactor moderator <b>deionizers</b> which previously had no pathway to disposal. Several studies have also been completed providing groundwater transport input for future special analyses. During the past year, since Slit Trenches No. 1 and No. 2 were nearing volumetric capacity, they were operationally closed under a preliminary closure analysis. This analysis was performed using as-disposed conditions and data and showed that concrete rubble from the demolition of 232 -F was acceptable for disposal in the STs even though the latest special analysis for the STs had reduced the tritium limits so that the inventory in the rubble exceeded limits. A number of special studies are planned during the next years; perhaps the largest of these will be revision of the Performance Assessment (PA) for the ELLWF.

40|$|The {{proposed}} action of disposing of 52 moderator <b>deionizer</b> vessels within the ILV was evaluated in this SA. In particular, {{a detailed analysis}} of the release of {sup 14 }C via the atmospheric pathway was conducted for these vessels since the major concern has been the nearly 20 Ci of {sup 14 }C that is associated with each vessel. The more rigorous evaluation of the atmospheric pathway for {sup 14 }C included incorporation of new information about the chemical availability of {sup 14 }C when disposed in a grout/cement encapsulation environment, as will be the case in the ILV. This information was utilized to establish the source term for a 1 -D numerical model to simulate the diffusion of {sup 14 }CO{sub 2 } from the ILV Waste Zone to the land surface. The results indicate a peak surface emanation rate from the entire ILV of 1. 42 E- 08 Ci/yr with an associated dose of only 3. 83 E- 05 mrem/yr to the Maximally Exposed Individual (MEI) at 100 m. The fact that the atmospheric pathway exposure for {sup 14 }C is controlled by chemical solubility limits for {sup 14 }C between the solid waste, pore water and pore vapor within the disposal environment rather than the absolute inventory suggests that the establishment of specific facility limits is inappropriate. With the relaxation of the atmospheric pathway restriction, the groundwater pathway becomes the more restrictive in terms of disposing {sup 14 }C or {sup 14 }C{sub KB} within the ILV. Since the resin-based {sup 14 }C of the 52 moderator <b>deionizer</b> vessels is highly similar to the {sup 14 }C{sub KB} waste form, the inventory from the 52 <b>deionizer</b> vessels is compared against the groundwater limits for that waste form. The small groundwater pathway fraction (1. 14 E- 05) calculated for the proposed inventory of the 52 moderator <b>deionizer</b> vessels indicates that the {{proposed action}} will have an insignificant impact with respect to possible exposures via the groundwater pathway. This investigation recommends that there be no ILV Atmospheric pathway limit for {sup 14 }C and {sup 14 }C{sub KB}. Further, {{in the absence of an}} Atmospheric pathway limit it was determined that there are no other applicable ILV limits (Groundwater or Intruder pathway) that would be impacted in any significant fashion should the waste package be disposed within the ILV.

40|$|The {{safety of}} fluoridated {{community}} water supplies for dialysate and long-term intermittent hemodialysis {{has been questioned}} since 1965 [1]. The only significant means of clearing fluoride from body fluids are renal excretion and incorporation into bone [2]. When dialysate is prepared with fluoridated water, fluoride ion moves along a concentration gradient from dialysate to blood [3, 4]. Because renal excretion is defective or absent in such patients, the fluoride administered during dialysis is incorporated into the skeleton. Under these conditions, serum fluoride concentrations increase progressively, and the bone content of fluoride rises above values obtained in persons with normal renal function who drink water that is fluoridated [3 – 6] (the serum fluoride concentration in normal persons who drink water with a fluoride concentration of 53 LM [1 ppm] is 0. 7 ± 0. 4 μM [mean ±SD]). Although {{it has not been}} established that fluoridated dialysate adversely affects the bone of patients maintained by hemodialysis, this possibility exists, particularly in patients who have been exposed to such a dialysate for many years. This and other problems associated with various substances in tap water have made deionization of water used for dialysate a common practice. Unfortunately, if the <b>deionizer</b> is improperly maintained, the fluoride content of the water may actually increase as the <b>deionizer</b> becomes exhausted...|$|E

40|$|Continuous {{need for}} the optimum {{conversion}} efficiency of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) operation has triggered varieties of advancements, namely in the thermal management engineering scope. Excellent heat dissipation is correlated with higher performance of a fuel cell, thus increasing its conversion efficiency. This study reveals the potential advancement in thermal engineering of a fuel cell cooling system with respect to nanofluid technology. Nanofluids {{are seen as a}} potential evolution of nanotechnology hybridization with the fuel cell serving as a cooling medium. The available literature on the thermophysical properties of potential nanofluids, especially on the electrical conductivity property, has been discussed. The lack of electrical conductivity data for various nanofluids in open literature was another challenge in the application of nanofluids in fuel cells. Unlike in any other thermal management system, a nanofluid in a fuel cell is dealt with using a thermoelectrically active environment. The main challenge in nanofluid adoption in fuel cells was the formulation of a suitable nanofluid coolant with heat transfer enhancement, as compared to its base fluid, but still complying with the strict limits of electrical conductivity as low as 2 S/cm and several other restrictions discussed by the researchers. It is concluded that a nanofluid in PEMFC is advantageous in terms of both heat transfer and simplification of the cooling system through radiator size reduction and potential elimination of the <b>deionizer</b> as compared to the current PEMFC cooling system.

40|$|Graphene {{has great}} {{potential}} for energy storage and conversion applications due to its outstanding electrical conductivity, large surface area and chemical stability. However, the pristine graphene offers unsatisfactory performance {{as a result of}} several intrinsic limitations such as aggregation and inertness. The functionalization of graphene is considered as a powerful way to modify the physical and chemical properties of graphene, and improve the material performance, which unfortunately still being preliminary and need further knowledge on controllable functionalization methods and the structure-property relationships. This thesis aims to provide in-depth understanding on these aspects. We firstly explored oxygen-functionalized graphene for supercapacitor electrodes. A mild solvothermal method was developed for graphene preparation from the reduction of graphene oxide; the solvent-dependent reduction kinetics is an interesting finding in this method that could be attributed to the solvent-graphene oxide interactions. Using the solvothermal method, oxygen-functionalized graphene with controlled density of oxygen functional groups was prepared by tuning the reduction time. The oxygen-containing groups, primarily phenols and quinones, reduce the graphene aggregation, improve the wetting properties and introduce the pseudocapacitance. Consequently, excellent supercapacitive performance was achieved. Nitrogen-doped graphene was synthesized by the pyrolysis of graphene oxide with nitrogen-containing molecules and used as an electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reactions. We achieved the structural control of the nitrogen-doped graphene, mainly the content of graphitic nitrogen, by manipulating the pyrolysis temperature and the structure of nitrogen-containing molecules; these experiments help understand the evolution of the bonding configurations of nitrogen dopants during pyrolysis. Superior catalytic activity of the prepared nitrogen-doped graphene was found, due to the enriched content of graphitic nitrogen that is most active for the oxygen reduction reaction. Moreover, we demonstrated a facile strategy of producing superhydrophobic octadecylamine-functionalized graphite oxide films. The long hydrocarbon chain in octadecylamine reduces the surface energy of the graphene oxide film, resulting in a high water contact angle and low hysteresis. The reaction mechanism and the effect of hydrocarbon chain length were systematically investigated. In addition to the researches on graphene-based materials, some results on advanced carbon nanomaterials and polymer composites for electronic packaging will also be discussed as appendix to the thesis. These include carbon nanotube-based capacitive <b>deionizer</b> and gas sensor, and hexagonal boron nitride-epoxy composites for high thermal conductivity underfill. Ph. D...|$|E
