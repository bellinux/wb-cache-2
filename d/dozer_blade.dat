50|$|Nagmachon is {{a heavily}} {{armoured}} infantry fighting vehicle fielded by the Israel Defense Forces. The Nagmachon {{evolved from the}} NagmaShot APC, which in turn was based on Centurion Sho't hulls from the 1970s and 1980s. The vehicle carries thick belly armour designed to withstand mine-blasts and mountings on the front hull for various engineering devices such as mine plows, mine rollers and <b>dozer</b> <b>blades.</b> In addition to its belly armour and the relatively heavy armour of the Centurion hull, the Nagmachon also carries explosive reactive armour to counter HEAT rounds, such as rocket propelled grenades.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1970s about 700 [...] "Track Marshall" [...] {{tractors}} were {{imported into}} Australia and fitted with <b>dozer</b> <b>blades.</b> These machines were {{powered by a}} 4-cylinder Perkins diesel engine and were considered very reliable in their time. They steered through an unusual wet band brake system through a differential gear system. This {{is known as a}} 'controlled differential'. It is impossible to stop one track, you pull the brake lever, the track slows down, the other track speeds up. This type of steering system absorbs a lot of power when turning. Several are still in use around the Northern Rivers area of NSW, Australia.|$|R
5000|$|GPS Technology {{was officially}} {{introduced}} as a guidance system for earthmoving {{machines in the}} late 1990s. Since this time, many manufacturers of earthmoving equipment now offer GPS and other guidance systems, as a factory option. Many companies exist that also sell GPS guidance systems for the earthmoving industry as a retrofit option. The two main companies for heavy equipment guidance systems are Trimble and Topcon. In April 2002, Trimble and Caterpillar Inc. began a joint venture known as Caterpillar Trimble Controls Technology LLC (CTCT). [...] "The joint venture develops machine control products that use site design information combined with accurate positioning technology to automatically control <b>dozer</b> <b>blades</b> and other machine tools". [...] Though aftermarket kits were available from various companies to retrofit an existing machine for GPS guidance, Caterpillar Inc. was the first heavy equipment manufacturer to offer GPS guidance systems as a factory option from the dealer called an ARO (Attachment Ready Option). [...] John Deere soon followed with {{their own version of}} ARO called [...] "Integrated Grade Control" [...] in 2006 on many Track-Type Tractors (TTT) and Motorgraders (MG).|$|R

Its jib is telescopic and when in traveling position it is folded down and placed on a cradle {{in the rear of}} the hull which is folded down against the engine deck when the crane is in use. A hydraulically operated <b>dozer</b> <b>blade</b> is mounted to the front of the hull; it can be used in a straight or V-configuration only. The vehicle is fitted with a searchlight. The IMR was developed in 1969 and entered service five years later.|$|E
