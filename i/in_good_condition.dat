5|$|The last coastal watchtower {{to be built}} was Sopu Tower, {{which was}} {{constructed}} in Gozo in 1667. The tower had almost collapsed but was rebuilt in the early 2000s {{and it is now}} <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>condition.</b>|$|E

5|$|At Syracuse, he {{repaired}} {{the city}} walls and the temples of the gods. He had new roads built and pushed to keep roads <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>condition.</b> He had planned to rebuild the palace of Polycrates at Samos, to finish the temple of Didymaean Apollo at Ephesus and to found a city {{high up in the}} Alps. He planned to dig a canal through the Isthmus of Corinth in Greece and sent a chief centurion to survey the work.|$|E
5|$|Both {{panel and}} frame are <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>condition.</b> That the panel retains its {{original}} frame makes it especially interesting to art historians, {{apart from its}} aesthetic qualities. The canvas has suffered little paint loss, board cracking, or other damage, and has been cleaned several times since it came into the possession of the Groeningemuseum.|$|E
5|$|He was {{described}} by sportswriters of the time {{as one of the}} fastest pitchers in the league, comparable to Amos Rusie and Ted Breitenstein. Kid Nichols remarked in 1902 that Stivetts' speed was as fast as Rusie, and could have extended his career much longer had he taken better care of his body. Baseball writer O. P. Caylor wrote that Stivetts' issues were entirely his own, blaming his hard-drinking lifestyle and his inability to remain <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>condition.</b>|$|E

5|$|Some {{national}} standards {{require that the}} cylinder valve includes a bursting disk, a pressure relief device that will release the gas before the cylinder fails {{in the event of}} overpressurization. If a bursting disk ruptures during a dive the entire contents of the cylinder will be lost in a very short time. The risk of this happening to a correctly rated disc, <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>condition,</b> on a correctly filled cylinder is very low.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{public and}} much of the {{military}} command structure were kept in the dark about the extent of the defeat: Japanese news announced a great victory. Only Emperor Hirohito and the highest Navy command personnel were accurately informed of the carrier and pilot losses. Consequently, even the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) continued to believe, for at least a short time, that the fleet was <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>condition.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{airstrip}} at Kaiapit was reconnoitred on 11 September 1943 by No. 4 Squadron RAAF, which {{reported that}} it was apparently <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>condition,</b> with the Kunai grass recently cut. Lieutenant Everette E. Frazier, USAAF, selected a level, burned-off area near the Leron River, not far from Kaiapit, and landed in an L-4 Piper Cub. He determined {{that it would be}} possible to land C-47 Dakota aircraft there. On 16 September, Hutchison approved the site for Dakotas to land.|$|E

5|$|Though Endeavour was now <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>condition,</b> {{her crew}} were not. During the ship's stay in Batavia, all but 10 of the 94people aboard {{had been taken}} ill with malaria and dysentery. By the time Endeavour set sail on 26 December, seven crew members had died and another forty were too sick to attend their duties. Over the {{following}} twelve weeks, a further 23 died from disease and were buried at sea, including Spöring, Green, Parkinson, and the ship's surgeon William Monkhouse.|$|E
5|$|A 1937 {{survey of}} Kennedy's rebuilt church by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire {{said that it}} was formed from a {{continuous}} nave and chancel, measuring in total 43 by 15feet (13.3 by 4.7m). The church, which was at that time <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>condition,</b> was entered through a porch on the south side, and there was a vestry on the north side. As well as the font, the church contained some 18th-century memorials. The font is now in the south chapel of St Cybi's Church, Holyhead.|$|E
5|$|After the Norman {{conquest of}} England in the 11th century a motte and bailey castle was {{constructed}} {{on the south}} side of the city, but the Norman rulers continued to use the older burh walls, despite the city having expanded beyond these defences in the north and south-east. During the years of the Anarchy in the 1140s, Worcester was successfully attacked several times; after the war a new city wall was built to improve the city's defences. The new walls, completed by the early 13th century, were constructed of stone and had three main gates. They were maintained <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>condition</b> into the 17th century.|$|E

25|$|Desirable height for mature males is 25½ - 28½ {{inches and}} for mature females is 24½ - 27 inches. Mature males <b>in</b> <b>good</b> working <b>condition</b> weigh between 88 and 110 pounds. Mature females <b>in</b> <b>good</b> working <b>condition</b> weigh between 66 and 88 pounds.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the wood}} {{recovered}} from the Levels was visually intact, it was extremely degraded and very soft. Where possible, pieces of wood <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>condition,</b> or the worked ends of pegs, were taken away and conserved for later analysis. The conservation process involved keeping the wood in heated tanks in a solution of polyethylene glycol and, by a process of evaporation, gradually replacing {{the water in the}} wood with the wax over a period of about nine months. After this treatment the wood was removed from the tank and wiped clean. As the wax cooled and hardened, the artefact became firm and could be handled freely.|$|E
5|$|Bears of {{northern}} regions, including the American black bear and the grizzly bear, hibernate in the winter. During hibernation, the bear's metabolism slows down, its body temperature decreases slightly, and its heart rate slows from a normal value of 55 to just 9 beats per minute. Bears normally do not wake during their hibernation, and can go the entire period without eating, drinking, urinating, or defecating. A fecal plug is {{formed in the}} colon, and is expelled when the bear wakes in the spring. If they have stored enough body fat, their muscles remain <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>condition,</b> and their protein maintenance requirements are met from recycling waste urea. Female bears give birth during the hibernation period, and are roused when doing so.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, the church, rectory, {{and schools}} were {{recorded}} by a historic preservation program {{run by the}} Ohio Historical Society, known as the Ohio Historic Inventory. This survey found the church in excellent condition, the elementary school in fair condition, and {{the high school and}} rectory <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>condition.</b> Although no historic preservation program was in effect, no threats to historic integrity were identified for any of the buildings, except for the elementary school, which was deemed to be in danger from being outdated.|$|E

50|$|This {{transport}} {{had considerable}} disadvantages, {{so there was}} not roads <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>conditions</b> and the rivers obligated to passengers to stray dozens of kilometers from the path. The carriages covered an average of 80 km per day.|$|R
