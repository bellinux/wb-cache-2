500|$|Latifah Muhammad {{from the}} BET called the ballad a [...] "field of {{emotional}} land mines, which is fitting given the subject matter". The A.V. Club writer Evan Rytlewski {{wrote that the}} singer managed to convey [...] "real, unfettered pain" [...] on the [...] "crushing tribute" [...] to her miscarried baby. Korina Lopez from USA Today called the ballad [...] "sweet" [...] and one that offers a [...] "peek into her family life". Mesfin Fekadu from the Associated Press noted the song to be more honest than Beyoncé's previous work. Mike Wass of Idolator named the [...] "fragile ballad" [...] as a [...] "heartbreaking letter" [...] and his personal favorite on the album. He noted how it may never be disclosed whether the song was inspired by Beyoncé's personal loss, before adding that [...] "if so, it couldn't be a more beautiful tribute". Anupa Mistry from Spin found a [...] "moving story of a miscarriage" [...] in the track. Tom Breihan from the website Stereogum lauded Beyoncé's decision to record a song about the important subject of miscarriage, calling it [...] "an incredibly brave and real act" [...] and noting how it acted as a [...] "hug" [...] to people with similar experiences. He concluded that [...] "eople are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> their eyes out to this" [...] before naming [...] "Heaven" [...] and [...] "Blue" [...] "maybe the realest, most grown-up things Beyoncé has ever done".|$|E
2500|$|The {{philosophy}} of parkour {{has been compared}} to that of martial arts. In an interview with The New Yorker, David Belle acknowledges the influence: [...] "There's a quote by Bruce Lee that's my motto: 'There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. A man must constantly exceed his level.' If you're not better than you were the day before, then what are you doing—what's the point?". In an interview with the press, Belle explained that parkour is a training method for warriors. [...] "So many people try to train easy 'Come do parkour! It's really cool!' But if tomorrow I made you do real training, you would end up crying. That's what you need to know: you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry,</b> you are going to bleed {{and you are going to}} sweat like never before." [...] In his book, Belle also quotes his father Raymond: [...] "If two roads open up before you, always take the most difficult one. Because you know you can travel the easy one." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{first she}} laughed, and next {{looked as though}} she were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{knew what}} you were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say,' <b>cried</b> Tom, looking fixedly at him, and {{speaking}} very softly. 'You don't tell me so?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Say {{what you}} were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say,' <b>cried</b> Jonas angrily, 'and let my face be! As long as I can show my teeth when I want to (and I can do that pretty well), the colour of my lips is not material.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen?" [...] <b>cried</b> Mrs. Travers. [...] "What's to be done?" [...] Jorgenson kept up his {{appearance}} of communing with himself.|$|R
60|$|She {{dropped her}} skirts. For {{a moment he}} feared that she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> out.|$|E
60|$|He {{could hardly}} speak. He was afraid {{for a moment}} that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry.</b>|$|E
60|$|NORA [almost awestruck]. You're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry,</b> are you? I {{never thought}} a man COULD cry. Don't.|$|E
6000|$|... "'What are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do?' she <b>cried.</b> And as I {{looked upward}} {{her eyes and}} those of the tiger were {{steadily}} fixed on me.|$|R
6000|$|... "He's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> strike!" [...] <b>cried</b> Phil, and as {{he spoke}} the shotgun in Sid Todd's hands was discharged. He fired among the leaves, {{and whether or not}} he hit the snake, nobody could tell.|$|R
6000|$|The {{next day}} the Swallow flew down to the harbour. He sat on the mast of a large vessel and watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold with ropes. [...] "Heave a-hoy!" [...] they shouted as each chest came up. [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Egypt"! <b>cried</b> the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.|$|R
60|$|She {{took her}} hands {{away from a}} face that looked just {{as if she were}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry.</b>|$|E
60|$|She was {{suddenly}} wildly {{sorry for what}} she had done. She felt she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry,</b> to behave absurdly.|$|E
60|$|TARLETON. Lina: I'm {{going to}} make a fool of myself. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> [he crumples into the nearest chair].|$|E
6000|$|... "For me, I am {{almost as}} much {{divorced}} as Catherine, and have had my head cut off as completely as Anne Bullen {{and the rest of}} them. Go away, Marie, because I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have a <b>cry</b> by myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'As if I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> endure that!' <b>cried</b> Albinia. 'No, no, Edmund, I am {{not likely}} {{to run away from}} you and Sophy! You may send Lucy off, if you like, but {{certainly}} not me, or if you do I shall come back the same evening.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stay?" [...] <b>cried</b> {{the little}} girl, beaming {{from under a}} Feejee crown of feathers, which {{produced}} as comical an effect upon her curly head as did the collar of shark's teeth round her plump neck or the great Japanese war-fan in her hand.|$|R
60|$|Here Mrs. Glegg's voice intimated {{that she}} was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry,</b> and {{breaking}} off from speech, she rang the bell violently.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm willing," [...] {{answered}} Tom recklessly. He knew {{fighting was}} against {{the rules of the}} college, but he was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> quits.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Is he <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> all night?' {{said the}} colonel, 'or are we {{supposed}} to sit up with little Mildred's guest until he feels better?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{has turned}} and is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fight," [...] <b>cried</b> Barringford, {{and a moment}} later they came in sight of the elk, backed up against a clump of walnuts, {{standing}} at bay, with dilated nostrils and a gaze of mingled alarm and rage in his large, round eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{precisely}} what I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> observe," [...] <b>cried</b> Mrs Croft. [...] "I would rather have young people settle on a small income at once, and have to struggle with a few difficulties together, than {{be involved in a}} long engagement. I always think that no mutual--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'YOU'RE not a <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stand that!' <b>cried</b> Mr Codlin, {{glancing at}} the clock again and pulling his hair with both hands {{in a kind of}} frenzy, but whether occasioned by his companion's {{observation}} or the tardy pace of Time, it was difficult to determine. 'Here's a world to live in!' ...|$|R
60|$|Again James {{looked at}} her; {{he could not}} make out the {{expression}} on her face. She looked almost as if she were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry,</b> and yet....|$|E
6000|$|... "Is he <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> all night?" [...] {{said the}} colonel, [...] "or are we {{supposed}} to sit up with little Mildred's guest until he feels better?" ...|$|E
60|$|His father's face, dusky red, {{twitching}} {{as if he}} were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry,</b> {{and words}} breaking out that seemed rent from him by some spasm in his soul.|$|E
6000|$|... “And {{purchase}} the cargo {{of one of}} those ships that they say are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> China,” <b>cried</b> Elizabeth; “turn your pot ash-kettles into teacups, the scows on the lake into saucers, bake your cake in yonder lime- kiln, and invite the county to a tea-party. How wonderful are the projects of genius! Really, sir, the world is of opinion that Judge Temple has tried the experiment fairly, though he did not cause his loaves to be cast in moulds of the magnitude that would suit your magnificent conceptions.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Kéfera {{suffered}} bullying {{when she}} was younger. [...] "I hated <b>going</b> <b>to</b> school. I <b>cried</b> every day. And blamed me for growing (both chronologically and to the sides). I thought that if I wasn't getting older, I wouldn't have to face school. I wished I could stay in kindergarten forever. And I {{did not know what}} to expect." [...] Kéfera Buchmann ...|$|R
5000|$|In direct {{retaliation}} {{after the}} vote, Helms and Moseley Braun found {{themselves on the}} same elevator with Senator Orrin Hatch and he began singing [...] "Dixie". Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun recounts the story that Helms entered the Senate elevator, saw her, and began singing, [...] "I wish I was {{in the land of}} cotton[...] [...] [...] [...] " [...] and then looked at Sen. Hatch and said, Im <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make her <b>cry.</b> Im <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sing Dixie until she cries.|$|R
6000|$|... "What shall I do?" [...] she cried. [...] "I can't {{walk home}} without that basket. It's {{perfectly}} dreadful!" [...] And {{she looked as}} if she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry.</b>|$|E
60|$|There was an {{uncontrollable}} {{break in}} her voice. She had a dreadful {{feeling that she}} might be <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry.</b> She made a great effort to be cold and clear.|$|E
6000|$|... "Cry!" [...] Ralph {{repeated}} indignantly. [...] "You don't {{suppose a}} boy of my age is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> like a girl! An English boy would be ashamed to cry, especially when Frenchmen were looking on." ...|$|E
60|$|Whilst {{his mother}} was yearning after him at home, and I do believe every hour of the day, and during most hours of the sad lonely nights, {{thinking}} of him, this young gentleman {{had a number of}} pleasures and consolations administered to him, which made him for his part bear the separation from Amelia very easily. Little boys who cry when they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> school <b>cry</b> because they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> a very uncomfortable place. It is only a few who weep from sheer affection. When you think that the eyes of your childhood dried {{at the sight of a}} piece of gingerbread, and that a plum cake was a compensation for the agony of parting with your mamma and sisters, oh my friend and brother, you need not be too confident of your own fine feelings.|$|R
5000|$|Because of this, Martin holds Mac in {{very high}} regard, {{describing}} {{him as his}} [...] "best friend" [...] to Guy when confronting him about not showing his sadness at Mac's impending death. When he learns that Mac is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die, he <b>cries,</b> knowing he would never see him pass his exams. He does attend Mac's wedding, though gets disappointed when he fails to hear Mac's real name during the vows, as everyone coughs when it is mentioned.|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be called <b>Cry</b> of the City {{as it was}} being filmed in the Spring of 1984. It was produced by a now ex-mob boss Michael Franzese, who was dubbed by Tom Brokaw as [...] "The Prince of the Mafia" [...] and made more money for organized crime than anyone since Al Capone. The film was held back {{for over a year}} before its release as Knights of the City in 1986 by New World Pictures.|$|R
