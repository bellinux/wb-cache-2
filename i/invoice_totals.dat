40|$|ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: The EPaNIC {{randomized}} controlled multicentre trial showed that postponing initiation of parenteral nutrition (PN) in ICU-patients to beyond {{the first week}} (Late-PN) enhanced recovery, as compared with Early-PN. This was mediated by fewer infections, accelerated recovery from organ failure and reduced duration of hospitalization. Now, the trial's preplanned cost analysis (N = 4640) from the Belgian healthcare payers' perspective is reported. METHODS: Cost data were retrieved from individual patient <b>invoices.</b> Undiscounted <b>total</b> healthcare costs were calculated for the index hospital stay. A cost tree based on acquisition of new infections and on prolonged length-of-stay was constructed. Contribution of 8 cost categories to total hospitalization costs was analyzed. The origin of drug costs was clarified in detail through the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. The potential impact of Early-PN on total hospitalization costs in other healthcare systems was explored in a sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: ICU-patients developing new infection (24. 4 %) were responsible for 42. 7 % of total costs, while ICU-patients staying beyond one week (24. 3 %) accounted for 43. 3 % of total costs. Pharmacy-related costs represented 30 % of total hospitalization costs and were increased by Early-PN (+ 608. 00 EUR/patient, p = 0. 01). Notably, costs for ATC-J (anti-infective agents) (+ 227. 00 EUR/patient, p = 0. 02) and ATC-B (comprising PN) (+ 220. 00 EUR/patient, p = 0. 006) drugs were increased by Early-PN. Sensitivity analysis revealed a mean total cost increase of 1, 210. 00 EUR/patient (p = 0. 02) by Early-PN, when incorporating the full PN costs. CONCLUSIONS: The increased costs by Early-PN were mainly pharmacy-related and explained by higher expenditures for PN and anti-infective agents. The use of Early-PN in critically ill patients can thus not be recommended for both clinical (no benefit) and cost-related reasons.

40|$|With {{regard to}} the use of {{rituximab}} for patients with steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome and frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome, not only has the regimen not been clinically verified but also {{there is a lack of}} health economics evidence. Therefore, we conducted a prospective clinical study on 30 patients before (with steroids and immunosuppressants) and after introducing rituximab therapy. Relapse rates and <b>total</b> <b>invoiced</b> medical expenses were selected as the primary endpoints for treatment effectiveness and treatment costs, respectively. As secondary endpoints, cost-effectiveness was compared before and after administering rituximab in relation to previous pharmacotherapy. The observation period was 24 months before and after the initiation of rituximab. We showed that there was a statistically significant improvement in the relapse rate from a mean of 4. 30 events before administration to a mean of 0. 27 events after administration and that there was a significantly better prognosis in the cumulative avoidance of relapse rate by Kaplan–Meier analysis (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). Finally, the total medical costs decreased from 2, 923 [*]USD to 1, 280 [*]USD per month, and the pre–post cost-effectiveness was confirmed as dominant. We, therefore, conclude that treatment with rituximab was possibly superior to previous pharmacological treatments from a health economics perspective.

When we do that, we have no gap between the way we understand problems and the way we implement their solutions. ” Bjarne Stroustrup Bits and transistors get a lot of press. They are the fundamental atoms in our digital world, the basic units that for some reason we often count in order to measure the size and power of our electronic creations. There are surely many professional software engineers who think in terms of bits and transistors when creating device drivers, operating systems or networking libraries. But end-user programmers have little reason to think in these terms. Ask an end-user programmer what his code does, and he will not say, “My application tells the transistors to do X, Y, and Z to my bits. ” Instead, he might explain that his web application collects the names and email addresses of people into a database. Or he might say that his spreadsheet computes the <b>total</b> <b>invoice</b> to be billed for each project. In other words, an end-user programmer’s world involves not bits but rather higher-level abstractions like person names, email addresses, invoice amounts and project numbers. Indeed, many professional software engineers also focus on such abstractions rather than raw bits when designing applications. For the most part, instances of these abstractions are concretely represented in applications as “strings”. Eve...|$|R

The <b>total</b> charge for a day of hospitalization, care and treatment increased by 83 %. In this total per diem charge the share of hospital charges in the strict sense declined from 60 to 53 %; the shares of charges for services and for pharmaceuticals rose, respectively, from 29 to 32, and from 10 to 15 %. Within charges for services the share for diagnostic services declined by 22 %; the share for surgery rose by 16 %, and that for miscellaneous other services by 89 %. For diagnostic services the decline was particularly clear for laboratory medicine (- 32 %) and for conventional imaging services (- 22 %), while cardiac and endoscopic investigations show a prominent expansion (+ 78 and + 83 %, respectively). In surgery the growth is quite homogeneous with the charges for urology, ophthalmology and orthopedics as the most important growers. In a group of miscellaneous, not diagnostic nor surgical services, which grows faster than all other groups, there is a marked shift from rather simple to technologically more advanced services. The increase in the pharmacy's bill results from increases in charge for both drugs (+ 49 %) and materials (+ 95 %). We conclude that the observed changes in charges reflect an intensification of care and an impact of technological innovation on clinical practice, including a phenomenon of substitution of old technologies for newer ones. status: publishe...|$|R

By applying the homomorphic feature of the cryptographic technique, we propose methods to allow most of the computing works of calculating customer <b>invoices</b> based on <b>total</b> electricity consumption to be done directly on encrypted data by the cloud.

We also propose a parallel version of our billing algorithm to utilize the processing capability of multi-core processors in cloud servers so that computation time is reduced significantly compared to using our sequential algorithm.

40|$|Zeolite mining in Australia {{has been}} {{developing}} at a steady, if slow pace since late 1987, when the first Australian zeolite mine commenced operation at Escott. This inaugural economic deposit, likely {{to be joined by}} others, is situated in altered ignimbrite, air fall pyroclastic, and volcaniclastic lacustrine sediments of the Late Carboniferous Currabubula Formation in north-eastern New South Wales. The Early Carboniferous Ducabrook Formation of the Drummond Basin in central Queensland is another zeolite deposit with good economic potential. While generally the regional geology for each deposit is relatively simple and understood, characterisation of the zeolitic mineralisation has been determined by a wide range of geochemical, petrological, physical, SEM, and recently thermal XRD and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods. Studies have confirmed that the prominent zeolite mineral mined at Escott is low thermal stability. Ca-clinoptilolite, and that this zeolite mineral is likely at the other prospects. This Characterisation is important as the natural zeolitic rock produced has physical properties (density, hardness, age, etc.) different from most overseas zeolitic rocks, thereby requiring specific trials to be developed to examine the application of its different properties. Also, different deposits show physical and chemical variations that might play an unknown part in performance for particular markets. The aim {{of this study is to}} compile and obtain new information of the characterisation of the Australian natural zeolites, in the manner outlined by Sheppard (1983). Such determination is essential for establishing a rational basis for the commercial use and application research of natural zeolites. No systematic compilation or examination had been made to date on the increasingly large amount of laboratory and exploration material collected over six years. It is hoped that this thesis provides a reference source, both for geological and other disciplines utilising zeolites. A starting point for any new zeolite deposit is the established characterisation methods for natural zeolitic rocks developed by the New South Wales Department of Mineral Resources (Fredrickson, 1986). Sale and marketing information gained in' Australian over its six year history has shown the importance of working with clients, and the development of innovative technology for the utilisation of natural zeolites (Stephen & Gout, 1993). Product development has ranged over packaging, particle sizing and selective high grade mining, with strong encouragement for bilateral communication with potential clients during trialing. Main barriers to expanded growth in some markets are milling and freight costs, which are currently being addressed. Future developments will include chemical and physical modification of the natural zeolite to meet certain client requirements. One threat to market development is the potential health implications of the fibrous zeolite erionite currently mined overseas. The natural zeolite industry in Australia is established, with <b>total</b> <b>invoiced</b> sales to date of over a million dollars, but growth is slow and difficult due to volume related inefficiencies resulting in high costs and slow consumer appreciation of the products. Geological studies have been minimal due to the need for low cost development, but this has changed with the realisation that detailed characterisation is essential. The role of the geologist has thus also changed, from that of active exploration, to technical coordinator for a mineral group with extremely wide product applications...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{efficiency}} {{measures are}} more and more important because the price of the energy is increasing every year. Moreover, saving energy it is also important for decrease the environmental impact. Kastvallen is a hockey arena built in 1997 that cools the hockey rink with electric compressors. The changing rooms are heating by using district heating. Actually the <b>total</b> <b>invoice</b> of electricity is above the 800000 SEK. Meanwhile the district heating invoice reaches the 60000 SEK. The aim of this project is reducing the amount of the electricity and heat invoice promoting smart energy improvements. The improvements proposals can be divided in three sections; energy savings of the changing rooms, efficiency increase of the compressors and dehumidifier energy savings. For heat the tap water and the changing room’s ventilation it is suggested to take profit from the heat released at the condenser and so reduce its heat load requirements. For this proposal two different configurations are studied. In order to increase the efficiency of the compressors the possibility of reducing the condenser temperature will be studied. Three proposals will be studied to carry out this commitment; Installing a condensing temperature control, installing a evaporate cooler and having a snow storage. Finally, one of the largest consumers of electricity in Kastvallen ice hockey rink is the dehumidifier. The current dehumidifier works with a desiccant wheel. The desiccant material extract the moisture from the processed air flow, after that the desiccant has to be reactivated with ‘fresh air’. This reactivation air needs to be heated 95 ºC, so the waste air released after the reactivation of the desiccant is air at high temperature. The first proposal is preheat the reactivation air with the hot waste air {{in order to reduce the}} heating requirements, conducting this proposal the total money saved each year would be 41811 SEK with a Pay-back around 1 year. The second step is studied the possibility of heating the air with district heating, taking into account that district heating is three times cheaper than electricity, conducting this proposal the total money saved each year would be 45629 SEK with a Pay-back around 1 year. The last proposal is to combine preheating and heating with district heating, conducting this proposal the total money saved each year would be 61553 SEK with a Pay-back around 1. 6 years. All the previous energy improvements proposals are studied with empirical and analytical methods and using the knowledge gained during the previous years of studies. The study concludes that the best proposal for the dehumidifier is combine the preheating and heating with district heating. In addition of the money saved, this measure allows to save 2. 71 Tm of CO 2 each year. For the refrigeration cycle, the study concludes that installing a controlled temperature control is the best option if the price of that is lower than 334726 SEK. If not the best option is heating the rooms and the ventilation with the condenser of the refrigeration cycle. These measures could reduce between 8 % and 20 % of the <b>total</b> energy <b>invoice</b> plus a considerable reduction of CO 2 emissions.

40|$|A {{construction}} company {{consists of a}} number of different sites where the physical production is taking place. This production is not always performed in the best possible way. There are numerous things such as organisation, logistics, co-ordination, technique, quality and others that can be improved. To have a process of continuous improvement at sites it is necessary to be able to evaluate their performance. Doing this only in terms of profits, which is the most common way, is not sufficient. Other ways of evaluating site performance such as productivity measurements are therefore needed. The {{purpose of this study was}} to find measures of productivity which could be used to evaluate site performance. Such measures should be cheap, understandable, univocal and be possible to relate to company objectives. With the results from productivity measurements a process of internal benchmarking could be initiated at construction companies. This could make it possible to find sites with excellent performance, investigate the factors of importance for such performance and try to use these results in a process of continuous improvement. Finding such determinants of site productivity is of vital importance for the improvement of the performance of a company. The overriding method in this work has been to "steal" ideas from others. By investigating how others had been measuring productivity and by evaluating these measures, the expectation was that measures would be found that could be applied on construction sites. However, a number of other and more "well define& methods such as Data Envelopment Analysis, inquiries, multiple regression analysis, case studies and practical tests have been used. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) had not previously been used to measure construction site productivity in Sweden. DEA was used to analyse 104 projects constructed during the period 1989 to 1992. The output factor used was value added, and the inputs were the costs of staff, workers and machines. The projects analysed included 3 3 office buildings, 40 blocks of flats and 3 1 roads and bridges, and the <b>total</b> <b>invoicing</b> amounted to SEK 2 232 million. Substantial differences in input saving efficiency could be noted regarding the projects included in the analyses. A second step in this benchmarking process was that of trying to relate the differences in efficiency to variables affecting the result. A questionnaire was therefore sent out to all the site managers. This information, together with the results from the DEA, was then analysed using multiple regression. The result was that variables such as additional work ordered by the client, formal education and employment time of the site manager and participation of workers in planning did not seem to have any significant effect for any of the types of products studied. For the blocks of flats the variables which showed a negative correlation with the result from the DEA were extended construction time, design and build contract, major parts prefabricated and serious disturbances. The only positive variable was in-house design. For the offices, variables such as a large share of the work being performed by subcontractors and a high proportion of the people employed being staff, were positive, while many different persons being involved in planning before the actual start of construction were negative. For the roads and bridges studied the positive variables were in-house design, a high proportion of staff, and many different persons being involved in planning before the start of construction work. The negative variable found was in this case high wages to the workers. Manufacturing industry exposed to foreign competition was assumed to have used measurements of productivity for a long time. Case studies were therefore performed at a number of production units throughout Sweden to find out how such measurements were made and how the results were used. As a reference case studies were also made at three sites within the construction industry. The findings were that there were large differences between the plants studied in the manufacturing industry and the construction industry. One of the major differences was the extent of the measurements. The units studied in manufacturing used many more different measures than did the construction sites studied. Another important and clear difference was the purpose of the measurements. The measurements performed in the manufacturing industries studied had several purposes. The main aim was to use the results for a comparison with those of competitors or with other units within the same company. The results from the measurements were also used to inform and motivate the employees, followup investments in new technology or changed organisations, control operations and as a basis for bonus wages. At the construction sites studied, on the other hand, the results were used mainly for cost forecasts and for estimates in connection with tendering. The most frequently used measure was labour productivity, and the reason for this was that labour productivity was considered to be both important and easy to understand. Other measures were, however, used to evaluate performance such as delivery time, stoppage times, actual hours or costs versus budgeted, energy used and many others. All these measures were considered by the company management in the manufacturing companies to be important for controlling their operations. At the construction companies the results were mainly used by the site managers to estimate the final costs. A general conclusion was that making performance measurements is never an easy task. There are always shortcomings with the measures chosen. In spite of this the advantages of measuring instead of not measuring are great when it comes to having a process of continuous improvement in a company. Various key ratios were measured at eight construction sites in northern Sweden and the results were evaluated. The different projects were followed for periods of between three months to one year with the help of personnel at the sites. The key ratios chosen were selected after performing the DEA and the case studies and after discussion with the persons at the sites. The key ratios were used to measure labour productivity, machine productivity, machine utilisation, material stock, material consumption, quality, actual hours versus budgeted hours, actual time compared to scheduled time and attendance. All these measurements showed that almost all the measures used could be obtained with limited effort with regard to both time and money. The results also contained valuable information which could be used to control site operations in a better way than that of today. Labour productivity was measured regularly using both value added and physical units as outputs. The use of value added was as a result difficult, mainly due to the great variations in site turnover. The results were easier to evaluate when physical units were used. These measurements, however, in some cases required more time. The measurements of material consumption, which were made using both physical quantifies and monetary value, were also in most cases easy to perform. Due to changes in both quality and size the results were sometimes difficult to interpret when physical quantities were used. Measuring actual costs, or hours, versus budgeted showed that this method of measuring is relatively easy but it also has many disadvantages. If such measurements are compared with the results from other sites it is necessary to use a reference against which these comparisons can be made. Informing and discussing the results with the workers revealed that there was a great interest from the workers in having feedback regarding their performance. A number of general conclusions regarding the execusion of measurements of site performance were drawn based on the results from the data envelopment analysis, the case studies and the tests with key ratios. One was that measurements of site performance could serve two purposes. The first was as a strategy tool for company management. By using the results from the site measurements in an internal benchmarking process it could be possible to identify sites with excellent performance within the company. By finding the characteristics of the good and the bad projects company management can improve competitiveness and long term profitability of the company. The second purpose was as a help for the site management in their daily work. The results could thus be used in a process of continuous improvement on site. In the selection of measures the purpose of the measurements should not soley be considered. The type of product also determines what measures should be used. For simple products with short manufacturing times and low complexity physical outputs should be used. For complex products with long manufacturing times the product has to be broken down into smaller, more measurable parts. Most of the data required to perform measurements are already available, or can be obtained with a moderate amount of effort. By using the workers for collecting and reporting some of the data, the work for the site management in this regard would be facilitated. This would, however, require that there would be a different flow of information than that of today. The workers should have more information regarding development at the site than they have today. There should also be a different flow of information from the site to the main office. The sites should report productivity data which could be used in an internal benchmarikng process where the prerequisites for good performance could be known to all sites and where excellent performance could be used as a reference.
