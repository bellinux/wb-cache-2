The view of the bridge is similar to those found in Astoria Park and Astoria can occasionally be viewed in the background of shots facing east.|$|E

We came last night, {{got up to}} a {{delightful}} spring <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> are now enjoying the little book room, with the windows open, hearing the birds sing, and the place looking beautiful. The plants in the passage are just watered: and with the passage door open the room smells like a greenhouse. Pamela has dressed four beautiful flower-pots, and is now working at her frame, while I write to my dearest mother; and upon the two little stands are six pots of fine auriculas, and I am sitting in a bay window with all those pleasant feelings which the fine weather, the pretty place, the singing birds, the pretty wife and Frescati give me.|$|E

I came up still thinking it was day I suppose, and I said, 'It's been a hard day ...' and I looked around and saw it was dark so I said, '... night!' So we came to A Hard Day's Night." ...|$|E

I had that with Regan Smith , had it with [...] McMurray on Saturday night [...] But you can't be in those positions if you don't build a great race car." [...] Also by winning the race, Kurt Busch would be the leader at the start of the Daytona 500, after Earnhardt was involved in an accident. Second-place finisher Smith stated: [...] "Kurt (Busch) and I worked good all <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> had good cars hooked up together. I hope we find each other and do the same thing on Sunday." [...] The first event took 58 minutes and 12 seconds to complete and the margin of victory was 0.065 seconds.|$|E
500|$|... "Callie and Her Sister" [...] {{was written}} by Mick Kelly, in his second writing credit for the series, {{following}} the [...] finale [...] "The Manbirds". The episode was directed by series creator Devin Clark and Richard Ferguson-Hull. [...] "Callie and Her Sister" [...] marked Ferguson-Hull's first directing credit for the series; he previously served as a director for the Adult Swim animated series Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law (2000–07). In addition to the main cast, [...] "Callie and Her Sister" [...] features appearances by recurring guest voice actors Pete Holmes, Julie Klausner and Mike O'Gorman. Klausner provided the voices of Lilith and Rosie, and main cast member Larry Murphy returned to voice Callie's father Aldermach. [...] "Callie and Her Sister" [...] was first hinted at in June 2011 during an interview by Clark on what to expect in the series' second season, where he revealed the episode's main plot and its references: [...] "Callie's parents get back together in one episode and {{give birth to a}} sister for Callie who because of being a supernatural creature, ends up aging one year, every <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> have an homage to The Omen in there. Mark and Callie end up taking over the responsibilities of her parenting dealing with this demonic child." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Time Will Crawl" [...] {{was written}} and {{recorded}} by Bowie in mid– to late–1986 at Mountain Studios in Montreux, Switzerland. He produced the recording alongside David Richards. Lyrically, the song addresses the pollution {{and destruction of}} the planet by industry. Bowie has cited hearing of the Chernobyl disaster in April 1986 as {{the genesis of the}} lyrics, and was in Switzerland {{at the time of the}} accident. He said, [...] "I was taking a break from recording [...] it was a beautiful <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> were outside on a small piece of lawn facing the Alps and the lake. Our engineer, who had been listening to the radio, shot out of the studio and shouted: 'There's a whole lot of shit going down in Russia.' The Swiss news had picked up a Norwegian radio station that was screaming – to anyone who would listen – that huge billowing clouds were moving over from the Motherland and they weren't rain clouds." [...] In another contemporary interview, Bowie said that the song [...] "deals with the idea that someone in one's own community could be the one responsible for blowing up the world." [...] At the time, he also stated that it was his favorite song from the album.|$|E
500|$|In comparison, some reviewers {{were more}} {{critical}} of American Gangster. Jonathan Crocker of Time Out London was polarized with the film, criticizing its aesthetics. In his review, he wrote, [...] "Scott's meticulous aesthetics can’t touch the urban texture and deep focus of The French Connection, The Godfather, Serpico and Prince of the City – all looming heavily in intertextual nods." [...] In contrast, Crocker praised Washington's acting, writing, [...] "He's immense: centering every scene with tractor-beam charisma, that dangerous, easy charm hovering between a luxury smile or blazing violence." [...] In conclusion, Crocker gave the film three out of five stars. Similarly, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a 'C-' grade, expressing that American Gangster is [...] "never dull, {{but it could have}} used more good old-fashioned melodramatic intrigue." [...] Gleiberman found Washington's performance to have [...] "a ghastly ingenuity". Empires Ian Freer rated the film three stars out of five; he stated that it was [...] "undeniably enjoyable" [...] and praised the cast, but also noted that he felt that [...] "very little in the movie feels fresh, re-treading scenes, riffs and imagery from the whole history of crime flicks" [...] and that the film did not explore enough of Lucas' story and Scott's visual imagination. Slant Magazine journalist Nick Schager harshly criticized the film, giving the film a one out of four stars. Schager remarked that the film was [...] "dumb as a rock", and that it was [...] "far too convinced of its import to be any fun." [...] Giving American Gangster a two out of five stars, Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian was disappointed with Washington's acting, asserting, [...] "He doesn't seem to relax and enjoy himself in the role, or even inhabit it very satisfyingly." [...] He resumed: [...] "He never has the menace of his dirty cop in Training <b>Day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> don't see anything like the transformation from street-hustler to leader in Malcolm X. That shoulder-shimmying swagger is rarely seen, and the brand-classic robes of American Gangster sit on him heavily." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "One" [...] was {{released}} as the album's third single in February 1992 as a benefit single, {{with all of}} the band's royalties being donated to different AIDS research organisations for each country in which the single {{was released}}. The group's manager Paul McGuinness commented on their decision: [...] "The band feels that [...] is the most pressing issue of the <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> really have to focus people's attention to the AIDS plague that has been with us for 10 years." [...] To promote safe sex, U2 sold condoms bearing the album title Achtung Baby at their Zoo TV Tour concerts. The cover of the single release is a photograph by David Wojnarowicz. The photograph depicts buffaloes falling off a cliff after being chased by Native American hunters. The single's liner notes explain that Wojnarowicz [...] "identifies himself and ourselves with the buffalo, pushed into the unknown by forces we cannot control or even understand".|$|E
2500|$|The {{victory of}} Adwa, which is officially celebrated across Ethiopia on the 1st of March every year, marks the momentous victory that Ethiopia {{achieved}} against the invading Italian army on March 1, 1896. Most historians {{agree that the}} Battle of Adwa is the first inter-state conflict of its kind where an African army has definitively defeated a European army. Ethiopia’s decisive victory at the Battle of Adwa has inspired several African countries in their fight against European colonialism. During the 121 years anniversary of Adwa, Ethiopian academic and social media contributor Wondwesen Tafesse posted a message on Facebook that reads, “Most nations have independence day, we [...] have victory <b>day.</b> <b>And,</b> <b>we</b> call it…A D W A”. This message resonated with the Ethiopian social media community, and has since been shared, retweeted and posted on different social media networking sites thousands of times. The message has inspired Ethiopians, {{and served as a}} motto during the 121st celebration of the Victory of Adwa on social media.|$|E

We're going to Mars....But when?...More practically, we're going within 20 years. Some of you could be walking on Mars before you are forty years old. You just have to believe.

2500|$|Night of the Living Drums, the band's fourth studio album, was {{initially}} set for release in June 2010, {{according to the}} band's official website. However it was pushed back for undisclosed reasons, then in December it was revealed the band had left Sony Music, after the label had refused to release the album. On 11 November 2011 Rogue Traders finally released Night of the Living Drums, after they had re-signed to Sony. It was released as part of The Sound of Drums which is a double album that includes a compilation disc, The Greatest Hits, and the studio recording, Night of the Living Drums. Ash described The Sound of Drums conception, [...] "he catalyst was when we realised we were coming up to the band's 10-year anniversary. We'd always talked about how much fun {{it would be to}} do a greatest hits one <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> struck on the idea of doing a record that combined the two. I have to give credit to Sony, because they changed their minds about us – we brought this idea back to them and they went for it".|$|E
2500|$|Like a Prayer {{was named}} after the {{influence}} of Catholicism on Madonna's early {{life as well as}} her struggles with religion; [...] "The theme of Catholicism runs rampant", she said. [...] "It's me struggling with the mystery and magic that surrounds it. My own Catholicism is in constant upheaval." [...] Recording sessions took place from September 1988 to January 1989. On January 27, 1989, a press release from The Albany Herald said the album would include [...] "a number of hot dance tracks" [...] but noted, [...] "much of the material [...] is of a personal tone." [...] The singer described it as a collection of songs [...] "about my mother, my father, and bonds with my family. [...] It's taken a lot of guts to do this". She also said that it would be her [...] "most different" [...] work to date; [...] "It was a real coming-of-age record for me emotionally, I had {{to do a lot of}} soul-searching, and I think it is a reflection of that [...] I didn't try to candy-coat anything or make it more palatable for mass consumption, I wrote what I felt". She told Rolling Stone magazine [...] "In the past, my records tended to be a reflection of current influences. This album is more about past musical influences". She chose to collaborate with Stephen Bray and Patrick Leonard, with whom she had collaborated on her previous studio album True Blue (1986) and the soundtrack Who's That Girl (1987). Both Bray and Leonard wanted to bring their unique style to the project, and they developed completely different music for the title track. Eventually, Madonna felt that the music presented to her by Leonard was more interesting, and she started to work with him. According to the singer, Leonard was also facing emotional turmoil; [...] "I was working with Pat, who was also in a very dark state of mind, and we worked in a very isolated place in the Valley". On January 6, 1989, following a nullified divorce filing in late 1987 and several publicized fights, one of which led to a 60-day prison term, Madonna and Sean Penn filed for divorce. [...] This incident inspired the song [...] "Till Death Do Us Part". The rest of the songs were written within two weeks; with [...] "Like a Prayer", [...] "Cherish" [...] and [...] "Spanish Eyes" [...] being written the first week. According to Leonard, [...] "we wrote a song a <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> didn't change them. And oftentimes the vocal that she did was the lead vocal, we didn't even change the lead vocal. That was it. She sang it. It was done".|$|E
