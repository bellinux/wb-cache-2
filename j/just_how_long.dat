However, the effect on marine ecosystems is unclear, since the larger types of phytoplankton, which are the preferred food source of most zooplankton, do not appear to have increased as much as the smaller types. So far, Arctic phytoplankton have not {{had a significant impact on}} the global carbon cycle. In summer, the melt ponds on young and thin ice have allowed sunlight to penetrate the ice, in turn allowing phytoplankton to bloom in unexpected concentrations, although it is unknown <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> this phenomenon has been occurring.|$|E
25|$|Following Duffey's murder, Nilsen {{began to}} kill with {{increasing}} frequency. Before {{the end of}} 1980, he was to kill a further five victims and attempt to murder one other, although {{only one of these}} victims whom Nilsen murdered, 26-year-old William David Sutherland, has ever been identified. Nilsen's recollections of the unidentified victims are vague, although he graphically recalled how each victim had been murdered and <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> the body had been retained before dissection. One unidentified victim killed in November had moved his legs in a cycling motion as he was strangled (Nilsen is known to have absented himself from work between 11 and 18 November, likely due to this particular murder); another unidentified victim Nilsen had unsuccessfully attempted to resuscitate, before sinking to his knees and sobbing, before standing to expressly spit at his own image as he looked at himself in the mirror. On another occasion, he had lain in bed alongside the body of an unidentified victim as he listened to the classical theme Fanfare for the Common Man before bursting into tears.|$|E
25|$|<b>Just</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> the {{trajectory}} could continue, however, remained unclear. According to the 11th five-year plan, China needed to sustain an {{annual growth rate}} of 8% for the foreseeable future. Only with such levels of growth, the leadership argued, could China continue to develop its industrial prowess, raise its citizen's standard of living, and redress the inequalities that were cropping up across the country. Yet no country had ever before maintained the kind of growth that China was predicting. Moreover, China had to some extent already undergone the easier parts of development. In the 1980s, it had transformed its vast and inefficient agricultural sector, freeing its peasants from the confines of central planning and winning them {{to the cause of}} reform. In the 1990s, it had likewise started to restructure its stagnant industrial sector, wooing foreign investors for the first time. These policies had catalysed the country's phenomenal growth. Instead, China had to take what many regarded as the final step toward the market, liberalizing the banking sector and launching the beginnings of a real capital market. According to an article in Journal of the Asia Pacific Economy by Mete Feridun of University of Greenwich Business School and Abdul Jalil from Wuhan University in China, financial development leads to a reduction in the income inequality in China. This process, however, would not be easy. As of 2004, China's state-owned enterprises were still only partially reorganized, and its banks were dealing with the burden of over $205 billion (1.7 trillion RMB) in non-performing loans, monies that had little chance of ever being repaid. The country had a floating exchange rate, and strict controls on both the current and capital accounts.|$|E

2500|$|French {{was made}} an Aide-de-Camp General to the King on 19 June 1911. The Second Moroccan Crisis was {{occasion}} for French to push again for greater Army-Navy cooperation. Admiral Fisher, recently retired as First Sea Lord, wrote (20 August 1911) that French {{had been to}} see him [...] "as the tool of Sir William Nicholson. I {{told him to go}} to Hell." [...] On 23 August Henry Wilson carried a CID meeting with a lucid presentation of the Army’s plans for deployment to France; Admiral Wilson’s plans to land on the Baltic Coast were rejected. French spoke to the Navy Club that year on the need for cooperation between the two services. The autumn 1911 manoeuvres were cancelled, supposedly because of shortage of water but in reality because of the war scare. [...] French accompanied Grierson and the French military attaché Victor Huguet to France for talks with de Castelnau, Assistant Chief of the French General Staff (Wilson—Director of Military Operations since August 1910—had already been over for talks in July). On the journey, French talked of how Douglas and Paget would command armies under him in the event of war, with Grierson as chief of staff. Plans for British deployment were especially welcome as French war plans were in a state of flux, with Joffre having been appointed commander-in-chief designate on 28 July. After his return from France in 1911 French inspected German cavalry manoeuvres in Mecklenburg, and was summoned from his bath to receive the Order of the Red Eagle.

The study also found that people who performed slightly above average at identifying how funny a given joke was tended to be the most accurate at assessing how good they were at the assigned tasks, and that those who performed the best tended to think they performed only slightly above average.

30|$|While the {{empirical}} literature on returns to education relies {{almost exclusively on}} school attainment {{as a measure of}} human capital, such measure may in fact be a poor approximation of an individual’s effective human capital. In recent work on the macroeconomic effect of human capital on a country’s economic growth, {{it has been shown that}} educational outcomes (the cognitive skills people have actually learned), not <b>just</b> attainment (<b>how</b> <b>long</b> people stayed in school), are more reliable proxies of human capital. Hanushek and Woessmann (2012, 2015) measure a country’s stock of human capital as the average test score on all international student achievement tests in math and science between 1964 and 2003. Estimating cross-country growth regressions, they find strong support for a positive association between human capital and long-run growth. When the stock of human capital is instead measured by the average years of schooling of the population, the association with economic growth is much weaker, and the model accounts for only one quarter of the cross-country variation in long-run growth (rather than three quarters with achievement). In fact, once differences in achievement are taken into account, there is no separate relationship whatsoever between years of schooling and economic growth. Several rigorous analyses, detailed in Hanushek and Woessmann (2012, 2015), indicate that the achievement-growth picture indeed depicts a causal effect of better educational achievement on economic growth. The results suggest that the quantity of education matters for growth only insofar as it in fact leads to better knowledge and skills of the population. It is what people know and can do that matters for economic growth, not <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it took them to reach that achievement. This evidence strongly calls for a focus on educational outcomes, not just attainment.|$|R
