2500|$|The {{concept of}} vaccine {{overload}} is flawed on several levels.

A study published in 2013 found no correlation between autism and the antigen number in the vaccines the children were administered up to the age of two. Of the 1,008 children in the study, one quarter of those diagnosed with autism were born between 1994 and 1999, when the routine vaccine schedule could contain more than 3,000 antigens (in a single shot of <b>DTP</b> <b>vaccine).</b> The vaccine schedule in 2012 contains several more vaccines, but the number of antigens the child is exposed to by the age of two is 315. Vaccines pose a very small immunologic load compared to the pathogens naturally encountered by a child in a typical year; common childhood conditions such as fevers and middle-ear infections pose a much greater challenge to the immune system than vaccines, and studies have shown that vaccinations, even multiple concurrent vaccinations, do not weaken the immune system or compromise overall immunity.

Interest in giving malaria drug therapy and prevention at the time of childhood immunizations has increased greatly following recent trials of intermittent preventive therapy during infancy (IPTi), stimulating this re-analysis of unpublished data. The effect of malaria chemoprophylaxis on vaccine response was studied following administration of measles vaccines and diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis (<b>DTP)</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Methods In 1975, six villages divided into two groups of children ≤ 74 months of age from Burkina Faso, were assigned to receive amodiaquine hydrochloride chemoprophylaxis (CH+) every two weeks for seven months or no chemoprophylaxis (CH-). After five months, children in each group received either one dose of measles or two doses of <b>DTP</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Results For recipients of the measles vaccine, the seroconversion rates in CH+ and CH- children, respectively, were 93 % and 96 % (P > 0. 05). The seroresponse rates in CH+ and CH- children respectively, were 73 % and 86 % for diphtheria (P > 0. 05) and 77 % and 91 % for tetanus toxoid (P > 0. 05). In a subset analysis, in which only children who strictly adhered to chemoprophylaxis criteria were included, there were, likewise, no significant differences in seroconversion or seroresponse for measles, diphtheria, or tetanus vaccines (P > 0. 05).

Objective: The objective was to study the effect of 50 000 IU vita-min A administered with BCG vaccine at birth on vitamin A status in both sexes. Design: Within a randomized placebo-controlled trial of VAS, we obtained blood from 614 children at 6 wk of age and from 369 mother-infant pairs at 4 mo of age. We assessed vitamin A status {{on the basis of}} serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) and measured se-rum C-reactive protein to monitor for concurrent infections. Results: RBP concentrations indicated vitamin A deficiency in 32 % of the children at age 6 wk and in 16 % at age 4 mo. VAS was not associated with higher RBP concentrations overall or in either sex. However, the effect of VAS varied with maternal education (P for interaction 0. 004) : At age 6 wk, VAS was associated with higher (9 %; 95 % CI: 2, 17 %) RBP concentrations in children of nonedu-cated mothers but not in children of educated mothers.

The mouse DTP MIA was shown to be specific and sensitive and to correlate with the six single in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for all antigens. Moreover, the MIA was expanded to include avidity measurements of DTP antigens in a multivalent manner.
