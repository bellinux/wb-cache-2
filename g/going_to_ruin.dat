25|$|The rivalry {{began with}} the teams' first meeting in 1991, with annual {{meetings}} beginning in 2005 when the Knights entered C-USA. Playing in the same division East Carolina and UCF were permanent opponents under the conference's scheduling structure. In recent years, the match between UCF and East Carolina has determined {{the winner of the}} Eastern Division. In 2007, UCF's only conference loss came {{at the hands of the}} Pirates. UCF won the division anyway, and ultimately took the conference title. In 2008, UCF was looking like they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ruin</b> East Carolina's dreams of the Eastern Division title like they did to Marshall, but with a late rally, the Pirates won in overtime making the Pirates the first C-USA team to beat UCF in Spectrum Stadium. A loss at East Carolina also determined them as the Eastern Division champions in 2009, while a UCF win at home was the difference in 2010. In the final scheduled meeting of the two schools in 2012, it would be UCF that would win 40–20, despite falling behind 14–0 early on. As of now, the final count in the series in 9–4 in favor of East Carolina. The rivalry resumed when the Pirates joined UCF in the American Athletic Conference in 2014. UCF won as time expired on a 51-yard Hail Mary pass from Justin Holman to Breshad Perriman, 32–30. This allowed for them to win back to back conference championships. ECU would blow out a winless UCF team the next year, 44-7. One year later, UCF would beat ECU 47-29 under first-year head coach, Scott Frost, against ECU's first-year head coach, Scottie Montgomery.|$|E

During the song, she {{repeatedly}} labels an ex's bad behavior as [...] "bullshit" [...] and tells him, [...] "fuck you". In another part, she mocks, [...] "When we did it, I'll admit it, wasn't satisfied." [...] In the chorus, she sings: [...] "It might sound like I’m an unapologetic bitch / but sometimes you know I gotta call I like it is." [...] The song was allegedly written about Madonna's ex-boyfriend Brahim Zaibat. She told Rolling Stone that the song [...] "it's like, fuck you, I'm going to have fun. You think you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ruin</b> my life and you think that it's over for me, but guess what? It's not. Life goes on."

2500|$|Bo Weinberg, {{concerned}} that the drain of money from Schultz’s rackets into his legal defense fund was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ruin</b> the business for everyone else, sought advice from New Jersey mobster Longy Zwillman, who in turn put him in contact with Charlie [...] "Lucky" [...] Luciano. Weinberg was hoping {{to make a deal}} whereby he would retain overall control and a percentage, but Luciano instead planned to divide the Schultz empire among his associates, which was to take place in the event of Schultz's being convicted.|$|E

2500|$|Parker {{was deeply}} {{unhappy with the}} episode in the day {{preceding}} its broadcast, remarking to the show's producers, [...] "I've lost it. I don’t {{know how to do}} this anymore." [...] He begged executive producer Anne Garefino to call Comedy Central and inform them that the show would not air, remarking, [...] "I don’t want the South Park legacy to be ruined, and this show is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ruin</b> it, because it’s so bad." [...] Parker went home unable to sleep and was surprised the following day that the episode was so well received.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the break}} room was located {{immediately}} behind the main nurse's station in obstetrics, others overheard {{all or part}} of it. Ballew, whose work-related absences from the nurses' station limited her exposure to the conversation, and head nurse Jean Welty, were among them. The next morning Ballew told Davis that Churchill had spent 20 minutes [...] "knocking the department" [...] and specifically [...] criticizing Waters and Davis, saying the former was trying to get her fired and the latter [...] "was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ruin</b> this hospital". After the conversation, Ballew claimed, Perkins-Graham was no longer interested in transferring. The morning afterwards, Davis asked Perkins-Graham to tell her about the conversation.|$|E
2500|$|Stefani {{believed}} {{that some of}} the fans of No Doubt would be upset with her solo effort, commenting, [...] " [...] were probably like, 'Why is she doing this record? She's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ruin</b> everything'." [...] She revealed that she too did not know why she was recording a solo album. For the remainder of the evening, Stefani and Williams incorporated this inspiration into the lyrics that eventually became [...] "Hollaback Girl". The two decided that Stefani did not have to have an answer for her intentions and that the choices she made were based on what she felt was wrong or right. On its creation, Stefani said, [...] "To me, it is the freshest attitude song I've heard in so long." [...] Williams was pleased with the song, commenting, [...] "Gwen is like the girl in high school who just had her own style." ...|$|E

5000|$|While it {{is never}} {{revealed}} who this is, the most likely suspect is Victor Dalimar.

However, the player won't be <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the <b>ruins</b> just yet, because in the MCF chronology, the Detective is summoned back to America, because the 13th Skull mystery awaits him in Louisiana.|$|R

60|$|To an onlooker it {{certainly}} didn't seem so simple. I never knew the meanness, the trickery, of the mining business, the sheer obstinate {{determination of the}} bigger capitalists not to make money when they might, till I heard the accounts of Jeff's different mines. Take the case of Corona Jewel. There was a good mine, simply <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ruin</b> for lack of common sense.|$|E

6000|$|DAN:--"He was so thin Uncle Roger {{used to say}} {{he always}} mistook him for {{a crack in the}} atmosphere.

6000|$|... "I'm as I was made, and {{to watch}} Allenwood <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ruin</b> is more than I can stand for.

60|$|Thus {{the members}} {{sit and talk}} in {{undertones}} that float to the ear through the haze of Havana smoke.
