60|$|Mr. Chorley's {{review is}} {{objectionable}} {{to me because}} unjust.

60|$|I {{see from}} the papers that my name has been sent in for Brigadier General. This is {{certainly}} very complimentary to me, particularly as I have never asked a friend to intercede in my behalf. My only acquaintance with men of influence in the State was whilst on duty at Springfield, and I then saw so much pulling and hauling for favors that I determined never to ask for anything, and never have, not even a colonelcy. <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> to Washington tendering my services, but then declined Governor Yates' and Mr. Trumbull's endorsement.|$|E

It was a beautiful dream! There are nine inns in a single day's journey between Milan and Mantua, and <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> to my wife from each of them.

60|$|In {{order to}} prepare things for my going home, I first (the Brasil fleet being just going away) {{resolved}} to give answers suitable to the just and faithful account of things I had from thence; and {{first to the}} prior of St. Augustine <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> full of thanks for his just dealings, and the offer of the eight hundred and seventy-two moidores, which was undisposed of, which I desired might be given, five hundred to the monastery, and three hundred and seventy-two to the poor, as the prior should direct, desiring the good Padre's prayers for me, and the like.|$|E
