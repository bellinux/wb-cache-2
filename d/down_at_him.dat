500|$|The line [...] "Beefcake", which Eric Cartman enthusiastically screams {{after hearing}} it on a Weight Gain 4000 commercial, became a {{well-known}} catchphrase following the episode's broadcast, and clothing items with Cartman shouting the line became very popular. One {{of the earliest}} and largest South Park fan sites was called www.beef-cake.com. Matt Stone and site creator Taison Tan decided to shut the site down in April 2001 when the official site South Park Studios launched. , a 1999 video game from developer Acclaim, included a mini-game called [...] "Beefcake", in which players control a Cartman character who moves {{back and forth between}} the screen eating cans of Weight Gain 4000 that are thrown <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> The salesmen from [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] are featured as antagonists in the mini-game. The [...] "beefcake" [...] commercial featured in the episode is also briefly seen in the third season episode [...] "Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub", when Stan is quickly flipping through channels on his television.|$|E
2500|$|The cage {{giving way}} {{completely}} {{was a surprise}} to both Foley and The Undertaker. The Undertaker later said that he thought Foley was dead following the second fall. [...] Foley was genuinely knocked unconscious for a few moments from the impact, but was able to come around. Terry Funk wrote in his autobiography, [...] "Watching from the back, I thought he was dead. I ran out here and looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> still lying in the ring where he'd landed. His eyes weren't rolled back in his head, but they looked totally glazed over, like a dead fish's eyes." [...] Foley later said that the only reason he survived the fall was because he did not take the chokeslam properly. In his memoir Have a Nice Day, Foley called it both the best and worst chokeslam he ever took, saying that despite its looks, he would have likely died if he had landed properly. He also cited the fact that the ring he landed in had a harder surface than the modern rings do, which stopped his momentum once he landed. Foley would later explain that the roof of the cell was supposed to sag sufficiently so that Undertaker could kick him through, allowing him to dangle by his feet and eventually fall in a rotation to land on his front.|$|E

60|$|The {{stranger}} in tweeds {{turned to stare}} <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> surprised.|$|E

60|$|Jimmy went forward, and {{disappeared}} through the scuttle into the forecastle, and some little while later Valentine came <b>down</b> and looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{with a dry}} smile.|$|R
60|$|Putting her guest {{into the}} best chair, Polly sat <b>down</b> and beamed <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with such hospitable satisfaction, that Tom went up several pegs {{in his own}} estimation.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Crisparkle {{laid a hand}} {{upon his}} shoulder, and stood looking <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{with a half}} pathetic, half humorous {{twitching}} of her lips.|$|E

60|$|There {{were delighted}} cries at this, but Custer {{appeared}} perfectly serious, and Thorne looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|She glanced <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> startled. He was sitting, {{with his}} legs crossed, {{looking up at her}} intently.|$|E
60|$|She {{knew then}} {{what it was}} that she had been hoping for. She looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and smiled.|$|E
60|$|They {{went into}} the drawing-room together, and half an hour had passed when Mrs. Acton beckoned to Nasmyth, and he {{followed}} her into an adjoining alcove. She sat <b>down</b> and looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> reproachfully.|$|R

50|$|Orson's alter-ego is a costumed superhero named Power Pig, {{which more}} often than not causes his friends or adversaries to fall <b>down</b> {{laughing}} <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Orson loves books, but is very influenced by them, by sometimes doing what's in the book. Sometimes when Orson reads a book, particularly a scary one, the stuff he reads about usually appears behind him and scares the others away.|$|R
60|$|The sun {{had cleared}} the redwoods {{when he opened}} his eyes again and saw Leger smiling <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

60|$|Partly {{because he}} felt guilty at doing all these things without his wife, and partly because he was now very hungry, March turned from them and got back to his hotel, where she was looking out for him from their open window. She had the air of being long domesticated there, as she laughed <b>down</b> <b>at</b> seeing <b>him</b> come; and the {{continued}} brilliancy of the weather added to the illusion of home.|$|R
60|$|The {{instant he}} spoke those words, Laura threw <b>down</b> the pen--looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with an {{expression}} in her eyes which, throughout all my experience of her, I had never seen in them before, and {{turned her back on}} him in dead silence.|$|R
