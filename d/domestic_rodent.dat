40|$|The {{series of}} papers {{in this issue}} {{reflects}} {{the present state of}} knowledge on opportunistic infections of laboratory rodents and provides speculation into where the field is headed. What has not been covered is the phenomenal growth in knowl-edge of murine infectious diseases over the last 50 yr. Re-markably, more than 60 genera of overtly or opportunisti-cally pathogenic viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, helminths, and arthropods are known to infect laboratory mice (Percy and Barthold 1993). Wild mice and rats are host to an even longer list of agents that can potentially reenter <b>domestic</b> <b>rodent</b> colonies. It is equally remarkable that although laboratory rodent populations are often free of these agents, many of these pathogens are still around.

The manifestation of defensive antipredator behaviors {{has been extensively}} researched in domestic species (i. e., the relationship between laboratory-bred rats and domestic cats). However, {{little is known about}} the expression of these behaviors in wild rodents. Studies have so far focused on quantitative assessments of cost–benefit trade-offs or giving-up densities. We examined the expression of fine-scale defensive behaviors in Arnhem rock rats (Zyzomys maini) in response to fecal cues from 2 predators (the northern quoll [Dasyurus hallucatus] and the dingo [Canis dingo]), a nonpredator (the short-eared rock-wallaby [Petrogale brachyotis]), and a control (water). We adapted a predator-odor avoidance apparatus that has been widely used for <b>domestic</b> <b>rodent</b> studies to film the behavior of wild rock rats in a captive environment. Rock rats did not alter their behavior in the presence of odors of nonpredators, predators, or controls. In the current study, individual rock rats behaved in a consistent manner across time, and we identified 3 individually consistent behaviors which may suggest the existence of personality traits in this species. We suggest that these individual differences may influence wild rock rat behavior more than predation risk. These differences should therefore be taken into consideration when investigating behavioral responses to predators in wild populations...|$|E
40|$|Domestic rodents, {{particularly}} {{those living in}} urban populations, represent a serious public health problem, and effective control measures are required {{to deal with this}} threat to human health. Because of the characteristic interactions between individual animals, certain behaviour patterns occur in rodent populations that are of particular concern to control biologists. The genus Rattus is an extremely diverse group whose ecological requirements are variable and flexible, while the genus Mus, on account of its small size, limited range, and modest requirements in terms of food and water, is also very difficult to control. For any control operation a knowledge of the growth dynamics of <b>domestic</b> <b>rodent</b> populations is needed; after a period of logarithmic growth, population increases cease when the habitat is fully exploited. Consequently, control operations that merely remove some animals lead only to renewed population growth. Trapping, poisoning, and predation are traditional control measures of this kind. Environmental modification is a more certain, but more difficult, approach. The use of chemosterilants offers some hope of radical control in the future, but at present, although some field trials have been made, these substances are not available for general use, one reason being their lack of specificity. Another problem connected with the use of chemosterilants is that, on account of the sexual behaviour and physiology of domestic rodents, it would be necessary to reach nearly 100 % of the population to obtain effective control...|$|E

40|$|Indigenous South American rodents are abundant, varied, and adaptable, and occupy {{most of the}} {{available}} natural habitats. Knowledge of their taxonomy and biology is generally superficial. Near human habitations the introduced Rattus and Mus are common and their contacts with man are often close.

Thus <b>domestic</b> <b>rodents</b> are brought into contact with indigenous species and the inevitable exchange of parasites may then produce unpredictable threats to human health. The role of both wild and <b>domestic</b> <b>rodents</b> in the transmission of certain infectious diseases, such as plague, sylvatic Venezuelan encephalitis, South American haemorrhagic fevers, murine typhus, and cutaneous leishmaniasis, is well established.

40|$|We {{screened}} Orientia tsutsugamushi from 385 <b>domestic</b> <b>rodents</b> and 19 humans with scrub typhus {{in rural}} Tai’an District, Shandong Province, a new scrub typhus epidemic area in northern China. Sequence analysis identified 7 genotypes in the rodents, of which 2 were also {{identified in the}} humans. Orientia tsutsugamushi, the causative agent of scrub typhus, is widely prevalent in the Asia–Pacific region and causes an estimated 1 million cases per year (1). It is characterized by dramatic genetic diversity (2). In the 1960 s, complement fixation initially identified O. tsutsugamushi as Karp, Gilliam, and Kato types (3), which are widely used as tested antigens in serologic assays. Since then,> 20 antigenic variants of O. tsutsugamushi have been identified by immunologic and molecular methods (2). The 56 -kDa type-specific antigen (TSA), {{which is one of}} the major immunogens of the agent and is associated with pathogenesis, has been commonly used for type designation (4 – 6). Scrub typhus is a traditional tropical rickettsiosis. However, since 1986, it has emerged and spread rapidly in temperate zones; the epidemic season is mainly in autumn and winter (7, 8). In the late 1990 s, the district of Tai’an, west of Shandong Province, northern China (116 ° 20 ′– 117 ° 59 ′E, 35 ° 38 ′– 36 ° 28 ′N), became a new epidemic area of autumn–winter type scrub typhus (9); however, few epidemiologic and molecular investigations of the transmission cycle of the disease have been conducted in this area.

Presence of the F 1 antigen, clasically used for diagnosis of Y. pestis infection, was demonstrated by immunoblotting.

Upon digestion with EcoRI and EcoRV, and probing with E. coli 16 S and 23 S rRNA genes, DNA from these Y. pestis isolates gave two distinct profiles which, taken together, suggest that the present Indian isolates represent a new ribotype.

40|$|Vector-borne disease {{prevention}} and control strategies, aside from {{those associated with}} <b>domestic</b> <b>rodents,</b> have rarely involved management of vertebrate populations, even though in many cases such management would appear to represent {{the most effective and}} economical long-term approach. Prevention of a long list of arthropod transmitted diseases is often at best a stop-gap procedure undertaken only after substantial disease hazard is detected in reservoir populations. More often, control actions await the detection of human cases, at which time short-term emergency control measures may be conducted, usually involving the use of toxicants against arthropod vectors and occasionally vertebrate reservoirs. In some cases, action is not taken because techniques are not available, but more often the decisive factors in action versus inaction are economic, jurisdictional, and/or organizational. Often, public health problems proceeding from unmanaged vertebrate populations are (justifiably) given low priority on the basis of costs versus benefits. If the same populations constitute a problem for health, economic, wildlife, or recreational interests, it may behoove us to pool our priorities, skills, and resources in collaborative management program designed for the greatest overall benefit rather than to proceed only on those programs that can be justified on the basis of one special interest...|$|R

The largest {{epidemic}} of pneumonic plague in the United States {{occurred in the}} county in 1924, and the last cases of plague associated with <b>domestic</b> <b>rodents</b> in the United States occurred here in 1925. Sporadic plague activity was recorded from 1925 to 1975. Since 1975, plague has been found annually and is now endemic in the San Gabriel Mountains and the interface, that area where suburban encroachment intermingles with wilderness areas along {{the southern edge of}} these mountains. Within these two areas, plague is amplified and is a risk to humans when it occurs in the California ground squirrel, Spermophilus beecheyi. This rodent has been implicated directly in two human cases, and is now peridomestic throughout most of the interface area. A domestic cat was implicated with another case; the role of domestic pets in plague ecology is discussed. Although large populations of Rattus rattus exist within the interface, they currently play no role in plague ecology due to the virtual absence of fleas. The oriental rat flea, however, is seasonally very abundant in Rattus norvegicus living adjacent to the interface area and poses an alarming potential for epidemics if plague ever was introduced into this host population. The plague surveillance program in Los Angeles County centers on an active intelligence network to report signs of plague activity and on the combined use of serologies taken from wild carnivores and S. beecheyi.

40|$|Abstract: Introduction: Leptospirosis is {{an acute}} febrile disease {{caused by the}} leptospira. It is {{considered}} a zoonosis that affects a variety of animals, both wild and <b>domestic</b> (mainly <b>rodents).</b> Humans become infected accidentally by contact with urine or tissues from infected animals. This pathology has variable clinical manifestations, ranging from inapparent infections and aseptic meningitis, to severe forms such as the Weil syndrome. Development: We present {{the case of a}} young patient of 22 years old with fever quantified peaks of 40 ° C, chills, profuse sweating, headache, muscle and joint pain in knees and malleoli, retroorbital and retrosternal pain; and appetite loss. The symptoms occurred after 20 days of having practiced extreme water sports. Conclusion: The late diagnosis of the patient and hospital readmission are the result of several factors; First, the homology with other infectious diseases that present acute febrile illness with similar symptoms as dengue, malaria, influenza, yellow fever, brucellosis; and secondly the lack of expertise and poor contact with patients who present this disease by the medical staff.

Overall, we found 21 rodents being infected with a Bartonella species including seven B. coopersplainsensis, four B. phoceensis, six B. queenslandensis, one B. rochalimae, one Bartonella sp. RN 24 BJ and two genotypes of a new Bartonella that we propose to give the provisional status "Candidatus Bartonella thailandensis". To {{the best of our}} knowledge, these Bartonella species have been detected {{for the first time in}} Thailand...|$|R

40|$|Companion animals {{comprise}} {{a wide variety}} of species, including dogs, cats, horses, ferrets, guinea pigs, reptiles, birds and ornamental fish, as well as food production animal species, such as domestic pigs, kept as companion animals. Despite their prominent place in human society, {{little is known about the}} role of companion animals as sources of viruses for people and food production animals. Therefore, we reviewed the literature for accounts of infections of companion animals by zoonotic viruses and viruses of food production animals, and prioritized these viruses in terms of human health and economic importance. In total, 138 virus species reportedly capable of infecting companion animals were of concern for human and food production animal health: 59 of these viruses were infectious for human beings, 135 were infectious for food production mammals and birds, and 22 were infectious for food production fishes. Viruses of highest concern for human health included hantaviruses, Tahyna virus, rabies virus, West Nile virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, Aichi virus, European bat lyssavirus, hepatitis E virus, cowpox virus, G 5 rotavirus, influenza A virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Viruses of highest concern for food production mammals and birds included bluetongue virus, African swine fever virus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, lumpy skin disease virus, Rift Valley fever virus, porcine circovirus, classical swine fever virus, equine herpesvirus 9, peste des petits ruminants virus and equine infectious anaemia virus. Viruses of highest concern for food production fishes included cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (koi herpesvirus), viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus and infectious pancreatic necrosis virus. Of particular concern as sources of zoonotic or food production animal viruses were <b>domestic</b> carnivores, <b>rodents</b> and food production animals kept as companion animals. The current list of viruses provides an objective basis for more in-depth analysis of the risk of companion animals as sources of viruses for human and food production animal healt...|$|R
30|$|Ossicles are mature {{lamellar}} and cancellous bone containing fatty {{bone marrow}} surrounded by hyaline cartilage [7]. Many theories {{have been put}} forward regarding the etiology of meniscal ossicles. They may be vestigial structures, as they are common in <b>rodents,</b> <b>domestic</b> cats and Bengal tigers [2], or they may represent a degenerative phenomenon due to the ossification of mucoid degeneration [5]; however, this is unlikely, as ossicles occur mostly in younger men, {{before the onset of}} significant mucoid degeneration [8]. A traumatic etiology has also been put forth, suggesting that the ossicles represent heterotopic ossification [9]; or they may represent bone fragments arising from the tibial attachment of the meniscal root insertion. This theory is supported {{by the fact that the}} most common location for meniscal ossicles is in the posterior horn of the medial meniscus [1, 8], which shows a strong attachment to the tibia and reduced mobility and is thus more prone to an avulsion tear. The normal contour of the adjoining bone on MRI, however, argues against this theory [8]. In short, there is no definite consensus on the etiology of meniscal ossicles.|$|R
