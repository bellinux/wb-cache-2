40|$|Mining {{operations}} at Donaldson Coal’s Tasman Mine were planned around maximizing the efficiencies in road way development and panel extraction within a mine {{to be established}} on traditional bord and pillar mining methods. Of particular relevance in early mine development, was that the installation of trunk conveyors stopped all coal production. Further, the mine plan required repeated relocation of production panel systems in relatively short cycles {{over the life of}} the mine. A key element of the requirements identified by mine management was to minimize the non productive time that occurred during installation of trunk conveyors and the installation and relocation of panel conveyors. Aggressive targets were established for the time to be taken from hand over of a completed heading by the Mining team to Engineering team until hand back with an installed and operational conveyor. These targets, amongst others, necessitated a specific approach to the design of equipment with particular emphasis on simplicity of transport, minimized underground assembly and <b>electrical</b> <b>termination,</b> standardisation of parts and the ability to efficiently add to the installation following initial operation.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop large signal modeling and optimization methods for Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers (CMUTs), especially when they are used in an array configuration. General modeling and optimization methods that cover a large domain of CMUT designs are crucial, as many membrane and array geometry combinations are possible using existing microfabrication technologies. Currently, large signal modeling methods for CMUTs are not well established and nonlinear imaging techniques utilizing linear piezoelectric transducers are not applicable to CMUTs because of their strong nonlinearity. In this work, the nonlinear CMUT behavior is studied, and a feedback linearization method is proposed to reduce the CMUT nonlinearity. This method is shown to improve the CMUT performance for continuous wave applications, such as high-intensity focused ultrasound or harmonic imaging, where transducer linearity is crucial. In the second part of this dissertation, a large signal model is developed that is capable of transient modeling of CMUT arrays with arbitrary <b>electrical</b> <b>terminations.</b> The developed model is suitable for iterative design optimization of CMUTs and CMUT based imaging systems with arbitrary membrane and array geometries for a variety of applications.

The proposed method is independent of the CMUT geometry and valid for large signal operation.

40|$|Acoustic {{methods used}} in fish {{abundance}} estimation constitute {{a key part}} of the analytic assessment that makes the basis for fisheries research and international regulations of marine resources. The methods rely on power budget equations and calibrated systems. Different instrument specific formulations of power budget equations and calibration factors are used in modern scientific echosounder and sonar systems, such as the Simrad EK 500 and the more recent Simrad EK 60, ES 60, ME 70 and MS 70 systems. These are instruments extensively used internationally for such applications, over the last decade or more. However, the lack of sufficient documentation in prior literature, on the actual power budget equations and calibration factors employed in these instruments, and their relationships to the traditional theory of fish abundance measurement, has caused some uncertainty and confusion among users. Control with systematic errors and drift demands the functional relationship of the abundance measurement to be fully known in terms of the electrical and acoustical parameters of the system used. The paper presents a unifying theory which seems to explain the different (instrument specific) power budget equation formulations and calibration factors employed in the mentioned echosounder and sonar systems, how they are related, and their relationship to the traditional and generic (instrument independent) theory of fish abundance measurement. Inconsistencies in prior literature are explained and corrected. Prior literature on the traditional theory is extended to provide more complete power budget equations for fish abundance estimation and species identification, by accounting for <b>electrical</b> <b>termination,</b> representation of echo integration, and the full range of electrical and acoustical echosounder parameters.

40|$|High-power voltage sourced converters(VSC’s) are {{becoming}} increasingly prevalent in modern transmission systems. These systems primarily use switching schemes generating kHz range harmonics, which may be magnified {{by one or more}} system resonances. Despite the high frequency harmonics, VSC systems widely use insulated equipment designed for operation at power frequencies; this includes critical substation components such as medium voltage polymeric cables and terminations. The stress grading systems of non-geometric (compact) cable terminations are susceptible to insulation degradation and eventual flashover failure, under high frequency harmonic stresses. As such, the present work studies high frequency voltage effects in cross-linked polyethylene cable terminations, and their relationship to stress grading (SG) design and material properties. Finite element modeling (FEM) has been used to analyze electric field and resistive heating in termination designs, in response to parametric variations in SG material properties. Experimental studies investigate thermal behaviour in a variety of commercial termination designs, using a high voltage, high frequency test setup developed to replicate conditions of high frequency harmonic resonance in a VSC system. The study results show that high frequency voltage application increases the electric field, resistive heating, and surface temperature rise, in non-geometric (compact) termination designs using field-dependant stress grading materials. Geometric (stress cone) designs are insensitive to high frequency harmonics; however, they have disadvantages compared to compact designs, making them a less practical long-term solution for high frequency applications. Among non-geometric designs, the field-dependent electrical conductivity σ (E), the permittivity ε, and the temperature dependencies of σ (E) and ε strongly influence the <b>termination</b> <b>electrical</b> and thermal behaviour under high frequency stress. Since thermal hotspots in cable termination SG areas may lead to material degradation and eventual failure, recommendations are made for an optimal non-geometric stress grading design, for terminations operating in environments where high frequency harmonics may be present...|$|R
40|$|Conducted EMI in Inverters with SiC Transistors Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) is {{the main}} side effect {{accompanied}} with the fast voltage and current switching transients in power electronics applications. Compliance of the Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) standard is prescribed for any power electronics product before entering the market. In recent years, the new emerged wide band-gap transistor technology Silicon Carbide (SiC) exhibits great potential to replace Silicon (Si) as the dominant transistor because of its superior qualities (e. g. faster switching, higher blocking voltage and higher operating temperature). However, these advances come {{at the cost of}} increased EMI resulting from the SiC transistor’s faster switching speed and higher switching frequencies. In the past, a large variety of EMI suppression approaches have been developed for motor drive systems. However, most of them serve the conventional Si power devices (e. g. IGBT) based motor drive systems. As the result, exploration of corresponding EMI emission mechanism and new suppression approaches is critical. The desired EMC investigations should cover the following features of the SiC power devices based drive systems.  The differences with the Si power devices based motor drive systems and the causes of the differences.  The common EMC analysis and reduction techniques {{that can be used for}} both SiC and Si devices based motor drive systems.  The approaches that improve the EMC performance for SiC devices based motor drive systems. In this thesis, with conventional Si IGBTs as the reference, systematic investigations are presented on variable speed drive systems using the latest SiC JFET as the power devices. Main achievements of this thesis are summarized as follows. System equivalent circuit modeling method for EMC performance evaluation This modeling method is used for evaluating the noise suppressing performance on varies noise propagation paths of the drive system. Additionally, by introducing the actual noise source emission instead of using idealized noise source (e. g pure square waveforms) emission, improved noise level prediction is achieved. The method is based on curve-fitting of the impedance-frequency characteristics measured on the leads of individual components and between different portions of the system. Various sub-circuits of the system are modeled as RCL composed equivalent circuits in order to represent details within the conducted frequency range. The model development procedure is presented in Chapter 3. Current transfer ratio measurements are used to verify the model. In addition, the model is also applied in Chapter 5 and 6. Chapter 5 utilizes the model to predict the noise emission levels of the SiC JFETs and Si IGBTs based motor drives respectively. Chapter 6 utilizes the model to predict the filter insertion losses. This method is applicable for both SiC and Si based motor drive systems. Characterization and cancellation of EMI filter parasitics to improve high frequency filtering performance This study explores the parasitics cancellation techniques for EMI filters with three-dimensional spatial layout that utilizes multi-layer PCB technology and employs surface mount technology (SMT) components. The employed SMT components are named x-dimensional (x-dim) components that have the same height (x= 14 mm) and double sided SMT <b>electrical</b> <b>terminations.</b> In addition to positioning the employed x-dimensional SMT components in the 2 D plane, the components are able to be placed in a third dimension by being stacked onto more PCB layers. This extends the conventional parasitic cancellation techniques to three dimensions. Chapter 4 discusses and implements the 3 D cancellation techniques in a LC filter for motor drives. The techniques enhance the filter performance especially in the high frequency range, which is critical to handle the increased EMI due to SiC fast switching speed. Comparison and identification of noise emission difference between Si IGBTs and SiC JFETs based motor drives This study compares and identifies the causes of the EMI noise emission differences between Si IGBT and SiC JFET based motor drives. In Chapter 5, two inverter prototypes – with Si IGBTs and SiC JFETs as the power transistors respectively are compared under the same power level and using the same layout. The gate drivers are designed to fully exploit the switching speed for the two types of devices at turn-on transition and to provide the same driving condition at turn-off transition. Their switching waveforms are compared under the inductive switching test condition, using one inverter leg consisting of two switches. The caused EMI level differences are clarified by Fourier analysis transformed from the time-domain measurements. In the system level, their EMI noise levels are compared under unfiltered, C filtered and LC filtered conditions. In order to identify the causes of the noise level differences, the two inverters are operated in the CM testing mode, in which the three top and bottom semiconductors are switched on or off simultaneously at a fixed 50 % duty ratio. Hence the maximized CM and DM wave shapes are achieved. Improve EMI filter to accommodate SiC JFETs in motor drives In the second part of Chapter 5, the EMI filter design for SiC JFET motor drive system is improved based on the presence of different noise emissions from the Si IGBT and SiC JFET source. An equivalent circuit model is delivered to predict the noise spectrum emitted from the SiC source and stands as the basis for improving the EMI filter design. The proposed EMI method effectively suppress the increased high frequency noise resulted from the SiC faster switching dv/dts and di/dts. The modeled results agree well with the experiments. Suppression at SiC noise source due to substrate capacitive coupling Two methods to suppress the noise emission due to capacitive coupling are proposed in Chapter 6. One is to use separated substrate, the other one is to use the broadband modeling. Comparing two inverters that use the conventional heat sink and insulated metal substrate (IMS), the emitted noise levels are significantly different due to the different capacitive coupling magnitude. The first part of the Chapter proposes to use separated substrates. The second part presents a broadband modeling procedure to identify the most effective filter design to suppress the capacitive coupling. Both methods effectively suppress the noise emission to comply with the IEC 61800 - 3 -C 2 standard. How EMI emission is affected by the capacitive coupling is identified...|$|R
40|$|This NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) Phase I study {{examined}} the revolutionary concept of performing resource collection and utilization during Mars orbital operations in order to enable the landing of large payloads. An exploration architecture was developed, out of which several mission alternatives were developed. Concepts of operations were then developed for each mission alternative, followed by concepts for spacecraft systems, which were traded to assess their feasibility. A novel architecture using Mars Molniya Orbit Atmospheric Resource Mining is feasible to enable an Earth-independent and pioneering, permanent human presence on Mars by providing a reusable, single-stage-to-orbit transportation system. This will allow cargo and crew to be routinely delivered to and from Mars without transporting propellants from Earth. In Phase I, our study explored how electrical energy could be harnessed from the kinetic energy of the incoming spacecraft and then be used to produce the oxygen necessary for landing. This concept of operations is revolutionary in that its focus is on using in situ resources in complementary and varied forms: the upper atmosphere of Mars is used for aerocapture, which is followed by aerobraking, the kinetic energy of the spacecraft is transformed into usable electrical energy during aerobraking, and the atmospheric composition {{is the source of}} oxidizer for a landing under supersonic retropropulsion. This NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) Phase I study explores a novel mission architecture to establish routine, Earth-independent transfer of large mass payloads between Earth and the Mars surface and back to Mars orbit. The first stage of routine mission operations involves an atmospheric resource mining aerobraking campaign following aerocapture into a highly elliptical Mars orbit. During each pass through the atmosphere, the vehicle ingests the atmospheric oxidizer and stores it onboard, using solid oxide electrolysis to convert the primarily CO 2 atmosphere into usable O 2 for propellant. Power is made available through the use of magnetohydrodynamic energy generation, which converts the motion of the plasma in the shock later into usable <b>electrical</b> energy. Upon <b>termination</b> of the aerobraking sequence, the descent vehicle detaches from the orbit stack, deorbits, and executes the entry, descent, and landing sequence. Hypersonic deceleration is achieved via a deployable heat shield to lower the vehicle ballistic coefficient, and supersonic and subsonic deceleration are achieved via retropropulsion. Mars surface operations involve resource mining of the Martian regolith to produce CH 4 and O 2 propellant to be used for the subsequent MDAV ascent back to high Mars orbit (HMO) providing an apoapsis raise maneuver to initialize the aerobraking sequence, in addition to providing fuel from the Mars surface for EDL propulsive descent. The Resource Collector Vehicle (RCV), which is used for the orbital mining operations, is raised back to HMO via onboard deployable augmented solar electric propulsion.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade there has been {{increased}} interest {{in the study of}} molecular motors. Motor proteins in particular have gained a large following due to their high efficiency of force generation and the ability to incorporate the motors into linear device designs. Much of the recent research centres on using these protein systems to transport cargo around the surface of a device. The studies carried out in this thesis aim to investigate the use of molecular motors in lab-on-a-chip devices. Two distinct motor protein systems are used to show the viability of utilising these nanoscale machines as a highly specific and controllable method of transporting molecules around the surface of a lab-on-a-chip device. Improved reaction kinetics and increased detection sensitivity are just two advantages that could be achieved if a motor protein system could be incorporated and appropriately controlled within a device such as an immunoassay or microarray technologies. The first study focuses on the motor protein system Kinesin. This highly processive motor is able to propel microtubules across a surface and has shown promise as an in vitro nanoscale transport system. A novel device design is presented where the motility of microtubules is controlled using the combination of a structured surface and a thermoresponsive polymer. Both topographic confinement of the motility and the creation of localised ‘gates’ are used to show a method for the control and guidance of microtubules. Two further studies use the actin myosin motor protein system. Both concentrate on the manipulation of actin filaments, gliding on immobilised myosin, by DC electrical fields. Motor protein is adsorbed onto several surface chemistries with varying protein adsorption properties. A range of electrical fields are applied to the motility assay and the performance is analysed in terms of the directionality and any changes in the average velocity of filaments on each surface. This enables us to attribute surface properties to particular motility characteristics and hypothesise as to the nature of protein adsorption. The same electrical motility device is used with an alternative method to allow a more detailed study of the effect of surface chemistry on the motility function and the response of the motility after exposure to an electrical field. The movement of actin filaments on myosin motors is accelerated by a DC <b>electrical</b> field. Upon <b>termination</b> of the field the motility is allowed to return to pre-field function and this section of the procedure is analysed together with the data from the previous study to draw conclusions on the protein adsorption properties of each surface. Both chapters are used to draw conclusions on the response of the motor protein system when it is adsorbed on different surface chemistries. The investigations carried out in this thesis are used to show both novel ways of controlling motor protein motility and also to highlight aspects of design that need to be taken into consideration when incorporating motor proteins into lab-on-a-chip devices.
