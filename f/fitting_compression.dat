40|$|International audienceIt {{is usually}} {{recognized}} that sludge management {{is a major}} problem in water and wastewater treatment, as it can account for up to 50 % of total operating costs. The effectiveness and cost of sludge treatment and disposal operations are strongly affected by its volume. Hence, the water content (or solids concentration) of the sludge is a key parameter which can impact the different steps of the whole treatment. Consequently, thickening and dewatering are key steps in the total sludge processing train. Sludge is classically dewatered by centrifuge, filter-press, belt filter or screw filters. In every case, the process efficiency is strongly affected by sludge properties. That is why users and suppliers need a parameter to assess sludge dewaterability and a standard method to measure it. Suppliers might use this standard data to guarantee dewatering performances of their equipment. The dryness limit is a well-known parameter used by French actors of sludge treatment. It is classically measured by a filtration-compression test until filtrate flowing stops. However, for highly compressible sludges, this condition is difficult to reach. That is why a simple mathematical model <b>fitting</b> <b>compression</b> data was used to extrapolate data for dryness limit assessment. The objective of the research is to study the role of every operating condition listed in FD-T 97001 - 1 relative to sludge dryness in order to recommend values for analysts. The influence of test time, pressure, cake thickness, filter cloth, flocculation conditions, pre-thickening and storage time on the dryness limit was strongly discussed for different kind of sludge. The results enable to establish a proper procedure to measure the dryness limit. This limit is always higher than the dryness reached with industrial devices. The deviation depends mainly on the sludge nature and the type of dewatering equipment used...|$|E

50|$|Push-to-pull, push-to-connect, push-in, push-fit, or instant {{fittings}} are {{a type of}} easily removed <b>compression</b> <b>fitting</b> or {{quick connect}} fitting that allows an air (or water) line to be attached, nominally {{without the use of}} tools (a tool is still usually required for cutting tubing to length and removal). These fittings act similar to the way regular <b>compression</b> <b>fittings</b> work, but use a resilient O-ring for sealing, and a grip ring to hold the (possibly grooved) tube in place. With metal tubing, a groove is needed to hold the tube in place. With PTFE tubing, the tube deforms around the grip ring.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Compression</b> <b>fittings</b> use a {{soft metal}} or {{thermoplastic}} ring (the compression ring or [...] "ferrule") which is squeezed onto the pipe {{and into the}} <b>fitting</b> by a <b>compression</b> nut. The soft metal conforms {{to the surface of}} the tubing and the fitting, and creates a seal. Compression connections do not typically have the long life that sweat connections offer, but are advantageous in many cases because they are easy to make using basic tools. A disadvantage in compression connections is that they take longer to make than sweat, and sometimes require retightening over time to stop leaks.|$|R

50|$|<b>Compression</b> <b>fittings</b> {{are popular}} {{because they do}} not require soldering, so they are {{comparatively}} quick and easy to use. They require no special tools or skills to operate. They work at higher pressures and with toxic gases. <b>Compression</b> <b>fittings</b> are especially useful in installations that may require occasional disassembly or partial removal for maintenance etc., since these joints can be broken and remade without affecting the integrity of the joint. They are also used in situations where a heat source, in particular a soldering torch, is prohibited, or where it is difficult to remove remains of water from inside the pipe which prevent the pipe heating up to allow soldering.|$|R

5000|$|The {{integrity}} of the <b>compression</b> <b>fitting</b> {{is determined by the}} ferrule, which is easily prone to damage. Thus care should be taken to when handling and tightening the fitting, although if the ferrule is damaged it is easily replaced.|$|R
5000|$|The taper on NPT threads {{allows them}} to form a seal when torqued as the flanks of the threads {{compress}} against each other, as opposed to parallel/straight thread <b>fittings</b> or <b>compression</b> <b>fittings</b> in which the threads merely hold the pieces together and do not provide the seal. The various types of pipe threads are designed for use both with or without thread sealants, as particular applications demand. The sealants, where used, are typically thread seal tape or pipe dope (sometimes plumber's putty). As the thread body is tapered (...) , a larger diameter keeps compressing into a smaller diameter and finally forms a seal (no clearance remains between the crests and roots of the threads because of the taper). This means that NPT fittings should be burr-free and lubricated using a lubricant like lubricating paste or thread seal tape. The use of tape also helps to limit corrosion on the threads, which otherwise can make future disassembly nearly impossible.|$|R

5000|$|It is {{critical}} to avoid over-tightening the nut or else {{the integrity of the}} <b>compression</b> <b>fitting</b> will be compromised by the excessive force. If the nut is overtightened the ferrule will deform improperly causing the joint to fail. Indeed, overtightening is {{the most common cause of}} leaks in <b>compression</b> <b>fittings.</b> A good rule of thumb is to tighten the nut first by hand until it is too difficult to continue and then tighten the nut one half-turn more with the aid of a wrench; the actual amount varies with the size of the fitting, as a larger one requires less tightening. The fitting is then tested: if slight weeping is observed, the fitting is gradually tightened until the weeping stops.|$|R
50|$|Compression Fittings: {{primarily}} seen on {{copper pipe}} spudguns, the <b>compression</b> <b>fitting</b> squeezes a metal ring against the pipe between a nut and the fitting body {{to form the}} connection.

50|$|Ports are {{passages}} that allow fluid {{to pass through}} the valve. Ports are obstructed by the valve member or disc to control flow.
