5|$|Evans {{had first}} begun to {{consider}} the potential applications of steam power for transportation while still an apprentice in the 1780s, and had developed rudimentary designs for 'steam carriages' in the 1790s. In 1801, Evans definitively began work on making his long-held dream of a steam carriage into reality. Early steam engineers, most notably Watt contemporary William Murdoch, had developed plans for a steam-propelled carriage incorporating a heavy flywheel, in which pressure was converted directly to rotary power, however it became apparent in experimentation that a low-pressure, rotary steam engine would never be powerful enough to propel a carriage of any weight forward. Evans's attention thus turned to a reciprocating engine, not only for his steam carriage ideas, but also for industrial application. Importantly, Evans became an early proponent of 'strong steam' or high-pressure engines, an idea long resisted by Watt and earlier steam pioneers because the necessary iron making and metal working technology was lacking. Evans recognized that a high-pressure steam engine would be essential {{to the development of}} a steam carriage because they could be built far smaller while providing similar or greater power outputs to low-pressure equivalents. Some experiments with high-pressure steam engines had been made in Europe, most notably an unsuccessful steam tractor developed by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot. However the prevailing fear of early steam engineering was that no boiler could safely contain high-pressure steam. Evans ignored potential drawbacks, and developed radically different designs which called for engines operating at high-pressure and the elimination of the condenser—a central component of conventional designs. His designs also incorporated a grasshopper beam, a <b>double-acting</b> <b>cylinder,</b> and four steam valves. Each valve was independently operated by one of four cams. The resulting design was a high-pressure steam engine that had a higher power-to-weight ratio that prevailing designs, making locomotives and steamboats practical. It was also mechanically simpler than condensing engines, making it less costly to build and maintain, and did not require large volumes of condensing water. These features would make it similarly suited for a variety of industrial applications.|$|E
500|$|Constructing his designs proved {{far more}} {{difficult}} than Evans initially envisaged—with just six working steam engines in the United States at this time, {{and a handful of}} workshops with any experience making them, it took Evans much of his savings and two years to yield a working example to display to the public in 1803. This first engine was powered by a <b>double-acting</b> <b>cylinder</b> six inches in diameter and with a piston stroke length of eighteen inches. Many components, such as the flywheel and crosshead, were made of wood in order to simplify construction. The boiler, the engineering of which was critical to the safe operation of the engine, consisted of a large copper shell encased in wood and cast iron rings in order to contain the pressure. The output of the machine was approximately five horsepower. This work output was modest by contemporary standards—the low-pressure engine of the nearby waterworks produced about twelve horsepower. But his steam engine was just a fraction of the size of pre-existing machines—the waterworks machine was over twenty-five times larger in volume. Evans unveiled his engine at his store and put it to work crushing plaster of Paris and, more sensationally, sawing slabs of marble. The showmanship paid off, and thousands came to see the machine in operation, while the Philadelphia newspaper Aurora declared [...] "a new era {{in the history of the}} steam engine." ...|$|E

5000|$|Steam engines {{normally}} use <b>double-acting</b> <b>cylinders.</b> However, early steam engines, such as atmospheric {{engines and}} some beam engines were single-acting. These often transmitted their force through the beam {{by means of}} chains and an [...] "arch head", as only a tension in one direction was needed.|$|R
50|$|The engine had two <b>double-acting</b> <b>cylinders,</b> {{side-by-side}} {{and equipped}} with slide-valves, {{and it was}} a simple-expansion type. Drive was transmitted directly by the crankshaft to a rear-mounted differential through using a chain. Owners often modified their Locomobiles by adding third-party accessories, including improved lubricators, condensers, and devices which eased the laborious starting procedure.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>double-acting</b> <b>{{cylinder}}</b> is {{a cylinder}} {{in which the}} working fluid acts alternately {{on both sides of}} the piston. In order to connect the piston in a <b>double-acting</b> <b>cylinder</b> to an external mechanism, such as a crank shaft, a hole must be provided in one end of the cylinder for the piston rod, and this is fitted with a gland or [...] "stuffing box" [...] to prevent escape of the working fluid. Double-acting cylinders are common in steam engines but unusual in other engine types. Many hydraulic and pneumatic cylinders use them where it is needed to produce a force in both directions. A double-acting hydraulic cylinder has a port at each end, supplied with hydraulic fluid for both the retraction and extension of the piston. A <b>double-acting</b> <b>cylinder</b> is used where an external force is not available to retract the piston or where high force is required in both directions of travel.|$|E
50|$|Later developments, also by Watt, {{produced}} a <b>double-acting</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The piston rod {{now had to}} transmit a force alternately pushing and pulling. The steam engine's general use of an enclosed cylinder, nearly always double-acting, made it dependent on the stuffing box and so the piston rod.|$|E
5000|$|A few early {{gas engines}} had <b>double-acting</b> <b>cylinders,</b> but {{otherwise}} effectively all {{internal combustion engine}} pistons are single-acting. During World War II, the US submarine Pompano was fitted with a prototype of the infamously unreliable H.O.R. double-acting two-stroke diesel engine. Although compact, {{for use in a}} cramped submarine, this design of engine was not repeated.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Double-acting</b> <b>cylinders</b> (DAC) use {{the force}} of air to move in both extend and retract strokes. They have two ports to allow air in, one for outstroke and one for instroke. Stroke length for this design is not limited, however, the piston rod is more {{vulnerable}} to buckling and bending. Additional calculations should be performed as well.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Double-acting</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{have been}} {{infrequently}} used for internal combustion engines since, although Burmeister & Wain made 2-stroke cycle double-acting (2-SCDA) diesels for marine propulsion before 1930. The first, of 7,000 hp, was fitted in the British MV Amerika (United Baltic Co.) in 1929. The two B&W SCDA engines fitted to the [...] in 1937 produced 24,000 hp each.|$|R
50|$|Extremely large {{gas engines}} were also built as blowing engines for blast furnaces, {{with one or}} two {{extremely}} large cylinders and powered by the burning of furnace gas. These, particularly those built by Körting, used double-acting cylinders. Gas engines require little or no compression of their charge, in comparison to petrol or compression-ignition engines, and so the <b>double-acting</b> <b>cylinder</b> designs were still adequate, despite their narrow, convoluted passageways.|$|E
50|$|Trevithick started {{building}} his first models of high-pressure (meaning a few atmospheres) steam engines, initially a stationary {{one and then}} one attached to a road carriage. A <b>double-acting</b> <b>cylinder</b> was used, with steam distribution {{by means of a}} four-way valve. Exhaust steam was vented via a vertical pipe or chimney straight into the atmosphere, thus avoiding a condenser and any possible infringements of Watt's patent. The linear motion was directly converted into circular motion via a crank instead of using a more cumbersome beam.|$|E
50|$|Where {{these were}} used for pumping mine shafts and only had to act against a load in one direction, {{single-acting}} designs remained in use for many years. The main impetus towards double-acting cylinders came when James Watt was {{trying to develop a}} rotative beam engine, {{that could be used to}} drive machinery via an output shaft. With a single-cylinder engine, a <b>double-acting</b> <b>cylinder</b> gave a smoother power output. The high-pressure engine, as developed by Richard Trevithick, used double-acting pistons and became the model for most steam engines afterwards.|$|E
5000|$|Lloyd 650, another {{two-stroke}} engine of comparable vintage, with two power cylinders sharing a single <b>double-acting</b> pumping <b>cylinder.</b>|$|R
50|$|For <b>double-acting,</b> double-rod <b>{{cylinders}},</b> {{when the}} piston surface area is equally {{covered by a}} rod of equal size {{on both sides of}} the head, there is no force difference. Such cylinders typically have their cylinder body affixed to a stationary mount.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a logical}} {{extension}} of the compound engine (described above) to split the expansion into yet more stages to increase efficiency. The result is the multiple-expansion engine. Such engines use either three or four expansion stages and are known as triple- and quadruple-expansion engines respectively. These engines use a series of <b>double-acting</b> <b>cylinders</b> of progressively increasing diameter and/or stroke and hence volume. These cylinders are designed to divide the work into three or four equal portions, one for each expansion stage. The image to the right shows an animation of a triple-expansion engine. The steam travels through the engine from left to right. The valve chest {{for each of the}} cylinders is {{to the left of the}} corresponding cylinder.|$|R
50|$|Some design {{details were}} carried over from a steam-powered {{prototype}} {{made by the}} Hildebrand brothers in 1889, including the water tank shaped to form the rear mudguard and the connecting rods of the engine driving the rear wheel directly. The water tank was repurposed to supply water to the cooling jackets surrounding the cylinders. The steam-powered prototype had a <b>double-acting</b> <b>cylinder,</b> applying power to the piston in both directions. With no double action available in the petrol engine, and no flywheel effect apart from {{the movement of the}} rear wheel, the return impulse for the piston was provided by heavy rubber bands.|$|E
50|$|Newcomen's {{engine was}} only {{replaced}} when James Watt improved it in 1769 {{to avoid this}} problem (Watt {{had been asked to}} repair a model of a Newcomen engine by Glasgow University; a small model that exaggerated the problem). In the Watt steam engine, condensation took place in an exterior condenser unit, attached to the steam cylinder via a pipe. When a valve on the pipe was opened, the vacuum in the condenser would, in turn, evacuate that part of the cylinder below the piston. This eliminated the cooling of the main cylinder walls and such, and dramatically reduced fuel use. It also enabled the development of a <b>double-acting</b> <b>cylinder,</b> with both upwards and downwards power strokes, increasing amount of power from the engine without a great increase {{in the size of the}} engine.|$|E
50|$|The inventor, William Joseph Still, {{patented}} his {{device in}} 1917 and on 26 May 1919 in London he announced it at a meeting, chaired by steam turbine inventor Charles Algernon Parsons, at the Royal Society of Arts. Still described a continuous {{process by which}} a <b>double-acting</b> <b>cylinder</b> is powered on one side by internal combustion {{and on the other}} by steam from a boiler heated principally by the waste heat from the water jacket and exhaust gases. He explained how the reserve of energy represented by the steam pressure in the boiler provided for any occasional overload which would defeat a standard internal combustion engine of the same power. Independent heating of the boiler was occasionally used, to provide extra power for exceptional conditions, and in the first stage of operation to allow the engine to start itself from steam power alone, even against a load.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{locomotives}} of {{this pattern}} were also {{made by the}} Royal Iron Foundry in Berlin. Though they worked well when tested at the Foundry, neither {{could be made to}} work properly at their intended workplaces, and both ended their days as stationary engines. The Murray/Blenkinsop locomotives had the first <b>double-acting</b> <b>cylinders</b> and, unlike the Trevithick pattern, no flywheel. The cylinders drove a geared wheel which engaged with the rack beside one rail. One of the geared locomotives was described as having two 8"x20" [...] cylinders, driving the wheels through cranks. The piston crossheads worked in guides, rather than being controlled by parallel motion like the majority of early locomotives. Between them, the engines saw more than twenty years of service.|$|R
50|$|For <b>double-acting</b> single-rod <b>cylinders,</b> {{when the}} {{input and output}} {{pressures}} are reversed, there is a force {{difference between the two}} sides of the piston due to one side of the piston being covered by the rod attached to it. The cylinder rod reduces the surface area of the piston and reduces the force that can be applied for the retraction stroke.|$|R
50|$|Pompanos engines were {{a unique}} {{prototype}} of the H.O.R. engine, having 8 cylinders. An inherent problem with <b>double-acting</b> <b>cylinders,</b> owing to the piston rod reducing the piston area on one side, is an imbalance in the force {{on each side of}} the piston. The H.O.R. engines were plagued by vibration and other problems as a result. While Pompano was still being built, the Salmon class submarines were ordered. Three of these were built by Electric Boat, with a 9-cylinder development of the same H.O.R. engine. The 9-cylinder arrangement was an attempt to re-balance the engine, so reducing the overall effect of vibration across the engine. Although not as great a failure as Pompanos engines, this version was still troublesome and the boats were later re-engined with the same General Motors 16-248 two-stroke V16 Diesel engines as their sister boats. Other Electric Boat constructed submarines of the Sargo and Seadragon classes were also built with these 9-cylinder H.O.R. engines, but later re-engined.|$|R
5000|$|The steam {{needs to}} be fed into {{the end of the}} {{cylinder}} {{at just the right time}} in the cycle to push the piston in the correct direction. In the other direction, the steam {{needs to be}} allowed to escape from the cylinder. As the crankshaft rotates, the piston rod moves up and down (or side to side in the case of a vertical cylinder) as well as in and out. Because the piston rod is rigid and the piston itself is long relative to its diameter, this causes the cylinder to rock, or [...] "oscillate" [...] on its special mounting (trunnion). In the design usually found in a toy or model engine, a hole in the side of the cylinder (one at each end for a <b>double-acting</b> <b>cylinder)</b> and a pair of holes in the port block are arranged so that this rocking motion lines up the holes at the correct times, allowing steam to enter the cylinder in one direction and to escape into the atmosphere or condenser in the other direction.|$|E
5000|$|The earlier single-action beam engines used a {{chain to}} connect the piston to the beam and this worked satisfactorily for pumping water from mines, etc. However, for rotary motion a linkage that works both in {{compression}} and tension provides a better design and allows a <b>double-acting</b> <b>cylinder</b> to be used. Such an engine incorporates a piston acted upon by steam alternately on the two sides, hence doubling its power. The linkage actually used by Watt (also invented by him) in his later rotary beam engines was called the parallel motion linkage, a development of [...] "Watt's linkage", but using the same principle. The piston of the engine {{is attached to the}} central point of the linkage, allowing it to act on the two outer beams of the linkage both by pushing and by pulling. The nearly linear motion of the linkage allows this type of engine to use a rigid connection to the piston without causing the piston to bind in its containing cylinder. This configuration also results in a smoother motion of the beam than the single-action engine, making it easier to convert its back-and-forth motion into rotation.|$|E

In Lebanon, the application of wave and tidal energy is not yet developed. The aim of this work is to design a high-efficiency system that harvests the sea wave energy to produce electrical power. A novel concept of a mechanical system will be presented in details. This system benefits from the transverse motion of waves and converts it into electrical power. The proposed wave converter consists of a flat plate to which two double acting piston-cylinder assemblies are connected. When submerged under water, the system exploits the drag experienced by the plate to operate the <b>double-acting</b> <b>cylinders</b> and pump water through a hydraulic circuit to a storage tank placed at a higher elevation.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to develop a}} model that represents the dynamics of a hydraulically operated forestry crane. The model was derived with the traditional Euler-Lagrange formalism and considers the crane mechanics, three <b>double-acting</b> hydraulic <b>cylinders</b> and the valve control unit. On the basis of the derived model we reproduced the entire crane model in MATLAB in order to run simulations herewith. This gave us the possibility to do parameter changes for further studies of the crane in motion. Another major goal within the thesis work was to estimate cylinder friction of the hydraulic actuators. We built up a test rig and used <b>double-acting</b> <b>cylinders</b> for determing their frictional behaviour. For this, we ran open-loop experiments in order to create velocity-friction maps that represented the static friction force of the cylinders. In this concern, we varied system pressure and cylinder load to study their influence on the friction force. By means of the derived static friction maps we approached the cylinder’s dynamic friction behaviour and applied both step and ramp control inputs to examine the spring-damping characteristics of the microspoic bristles in the contacting area. The dynamic friction experiments have been exerted in the fashion of the LuGre model. As a result we acquired different nominal friction parameters that we necessarily used to develope adequate friction models. A third {{objective of}} this thesis was to establish a crane-tip control. Instead of a traditional control, providing a direct relationship between joystick input and cylinder extension, the focus was to build up a control for the end-effector’s trajectory in a two-dimensional frame. This could be achieved by using inverse kinematics {{in order to determine the}} required joint angles that corresponded to the desired position of the crane-tip. The work also contains a CD including all developed MATLAB models that have been written within this project...|$|R

The developed model {{takes advantage of the}} availability of basic hydraulic components which can be parameterized based on real ones, including most of the hydraulic losses. With the aim of optimizing the extraction of wave energy, this PTO is able to modify its restraining torque through the independent activation of the hydraulic cylinders located in the primary transmission and modifying some geometrical parameters related to their fixation points respecting to the axis torque. The ultimate objective of this PTO is to provide a wide range of torques that can be modulated by modifying the operating high pressure of the HP accumulator, the combination of the available areas of the <b>double-acting</b> hydraulic <b>cylinder</b> and the location of their fixation points with respect to the applied movement. This factor can help to improve the control of WEC based on activated bodies with the aim to optimize the extraction of wave energy.

50|$|In {{the marine}} environment, the general {{requirement}} was for autonomy and increased operating range, as ships {{had to carry}} their coal supplies. The old salt-water boiler was thus no longer adequate {{and had to be}} replaced by a closed fresh-water circuit with condenser. The result from 1880 onwards was the multiple-expansion engine using three or four expansion stages (triple- and quadruple-expansion engines). These engines used a series of <b>double-acting</b> <b>cylinders</b> of progressively increasing diameter and/or stroke (and hence volume) designed to divide the work into three or four, as appropriate, equal portions for each expansion stage. Where space is at a premium, two smaller cylinders of a large sum volume might be used for the low-pressure stage. Multiple-expansion engines typically had the cylinders arranged in-line, but various other formations were used. In the late 19th century, the Yarrow-Schlick-Tweedy balancing 'system' was used on some marine triple-expansion engines. Y-S-T engines divided the low-pressure expansion stages between two cylinders, one at each end of the engine. This allowed the crankshaft to be better balanced, resulting in a smoother, faster-responding engine which ran with less vibration. This made the 4-cylinder triple-expansion engine popular with large passenger liners (such as the Olympic class), but was ultimately replaced by the virtually vibration-free steam turbine.|$|R
50|$|The {{important}} {{concept of}} pressure lubrication of engine bearings began with high-speed steam engines {{and is now}} a vital part of internal combustion engines. This is both reliable as a lubrication system and also allows the use of hydrodynamic bearings ('oil wedge') that can support greater loads. The first patents for this were issued to Belliss & Morcom in 1890, from the work of their draughtsman Albert Charles Pain. Belliss & Morcom preferred <b>double-acting</b> <b>cylinders,</b> so as to produce the smallest possible engines for a given power; one of their major markets, like Peter Brotherhood, was in supplying generator sets to the Royal Navy for use in the confines of a warship engine room. The difficulty of a double-acting engine was that the direction of the forces in the connecting rod now reverses between compression and tension, so that the bearing clearances must be made tighter to avoid any rattling. Belliss and Morcom developed a two-cylinder engine of 20 bhp at 625 rpm that used a small separate oil pump to feed oil under pressure to the crank bearings, through long drilled holes in the crankshaft. This provided reliable lubrication and cooling and the pressure of the oil film was sufficient to allow the use of double-acting engines with adequate clearance to provide free running.|$|R
