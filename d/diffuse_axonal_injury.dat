40|$|International audienceShear {{waves that}} {{propagate}} in soft solids, {{such as the}} brain, are strongly nonlinear and can develop into shock waves in less than one wavelength. We hypothesize that these shear shock waves could be responsible for certain types of traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and that the spherical geometry of the skull bone could focus shear waves deep in the brain, generating <b>diffuse</b> <b>axonal</b> <b>injuries.</b> Theoretical models and numerical methods that describe nonlinear polarized shear waves in soft solids such as the brain are presented. They include the cubic nonlinearities that are characteristic of soft solids and the specific types of nonclassical attenuation and dispersion observed in soft tissues and the brain. The numerical methods are validated with analytical solutions, where possible, and with self-similar scaling laws where no known solutions exist. Initial conditions based on a human head X-ray microtomography (CT) were used to simulate focused shear shock waves in the brain. Three regimes are investigated with shock wave formation distances of 2 : 54 m; 0 : 018 m, and 0 : 0064 m. We demonstrate that under realistic loading scenarios, with nonlinear properties consistent with measurements in the brain, and when the shock wave propagation distance and focal distance coincide, nonlinear propagation can easily overcome attenuation to generate shear shocks deep inside the brain. Due to these effects, the accelerations in the focal are larger {{by a factor of}} 15 compared to acceleration at the skull surface.

Early recognition of patients with brain cellular damage allows for early rehabilitation and patient outcome improvement. MethodsIn this prospective study, the clinical conditions of patients with mild to moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) were assessed, and patient serum S 100 B levels were measured. Patients were followed up one month later and evaluated for level of consciousness, {{presence or absence of}} post-traumatic headache, and daily activity performance (using the Barthel scale). Student's t-test and the chi-square test were used for data analysis, which was performed using SPSS software. ResultsThe mean serum S 100 B value was significantly lower for patients with minor TBI than for patients with moderate TBI (23. 1 ± 14. 2 ng/dl and 134. 0 ± 245. 0 ng/dl, respectively). Patients with normal CT scans also had statistically significantly lower serum S 100 B levels than patients with abnormal CT findings. The mean S 100 B value was statistically significantly higher for patients with suspected <b>diffused</b> <b>axonal</b> <b>injury</b> (632. 18 ± 516. 1 ng/dl) than for patients with other abnormal CT findings (p= 0. 000) : 24. 97 ± 22. 9 ng/dl in patients with normal CT results; 41. 56 ± 25. 7 ng/dl in patients with skull bone fracture; 57. 38 ± 28. 9 ng/dl in patients with intracranial hemorrhage; and 76. 23 ± 38. 3 ng/dl in patients with fracture plus intracranial hemorrhage).

40|$|Aims: Traumatic {{brain injury}} is a {{significant}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} worldwide. An epidemiological association between head injury and long-term cognitive decline has been described for many years and recent clinical studies have highlighted functional impairment within 12 months of a mild head injury. In addition chronic traumatic encephalopathy is a recently described condition in cases of repetitive head injury. There are shared mechanisms between traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer's disease, and it has been hypothesized that neuroinflammation, in the form of microglial activation, may be a mechanism underlying chronic neurodegenerative processes after traumatic brain injury. Methods: This study assessed the microglial reaction after head injury in a range of ages and survival periods, from < 24 -h survival through to 47 -year survival. Immunohistochemistry for reactive microglia (CD 68 and CR 3 / 43) was performed on human autopsy brain tissue and assessed ‘blind’ by quantitative image analysis. Head injury cases were compared with age matched controls, and within the traumatic brain injury group cases with <b>diffuse</b> traumatic <b>axonal</b> <b>injury</b> were compared with cases without <b>diffuse</b> traumatic <b>axonal</b> <b>injury.</b> Results: A major finding was a neuroinflammatory response that develops within the first week and persists for several months after traumatic brain injury, but has returned to control levels after several years.

40|$|Abstract — We {{investigate}} numerically which {{properties of}} the human brain cause <b>Diffuse</b> <b>Axonal</b> <b>Injuries</b> (DAI) to appear in a scattered and pointwise manner near the gray/white matter boundary, mostly in the white matter. These simulations are based on our dually-nonlinear, viscoelastic, fluid Traumatic Brain Injury model, which includes a nonlinear stress/strain relation. We simulate rotational accelerations and decelerations of a human head that replicate realistic traumatic scenarios. The rotational loads are quantified by our Brain Injury Criterion, which extends the translational Head Injury Criterion to arbitrary head motions. Our simulations show that: (i) DAI occurrences near the gray/white matter boundary {{can be explained by the}} difference in the gray and the white matter’s shear modulus values, (ii) the scattered/pointwise DAI character can be attributed to the nonlinear fluid aspect of the brain tissue, and (iii) the scattering of DAI deeper in the white matter appears to be caused by the complicated shape of the brain.

40|$|INTRODUCTION For {{over fifty}} years {{the theory of}} {{viscoelasticity}} has {{played a major role}} in modeling brain injuries. The main premise of this approach is that the brain is injured when the strain field, created in the brain tissue by shear waves, assumes sufficiently high values. In particular, the linear Voigt PDE system describing the motion of shear waves in viscoelastic solids has been successfully used in modeling closed head injuries such as hematomas [1] or <b>diffuse</b> <b>axonal</b> <b>injuries</b> (DAI) [2]. Whereas it is generally accepted that a 50 % stretching of neurons can cause hematomas [3], the exact mechanism of DAI is unclear. The prevailing theory is that a 20 %- 30 % stretching of a neuron's membrane leads to a chemical 'poisoning' that causes neuronal death around twelve hours after the accident [4]. Mechanically, neurons might be able to 'survive' even 80 % stretching [5]. However, the basic deficiency of the linear Voigt model, as well as other models known to us, is that they canno...|$|R
2500|$|Axons are {{normally}} elastic, but when rapidly stretched they become brittle, and the axonal cytoskeleton can be broken. [...] Misalignment of cytoskeletal elements after stretch injury {{can lead to}} tearing of the axon and death of the neuron. [...] Axonal transport continues {{up to the point}} of the break in the cytoskeleton, but no further, leading to a buildup of transport products and local swelling at that point. When it becomes large enough, swelling can tear the axon {{at the site of the}} break in the cytoskeleton, causing it to draw back toward the cell body and form a bulb. This bulb is called a retraction ball, the hallmark of <b>diffuse</b> <b>axonal</b> <b>injury.</b>|$|E
2500|$|DAI is {{difficult}} to detect since it does not show up well on CT scans or with other macroscopic imaging techniques, though it shows up microscopically. [...] However, there are characteristics typical of DAI {{that may or may}} not show up on a CT scan. [...] Diffuse injury has more microscopic injury than macroscopic injury and {{is difficult}} to detect with CT and MRI, but its presence can be inferred when small bleeds are visible in the corpus callosum or the cerebral cortex. [...] MRI is more useful than CT for detecting characteristics of <b>diffuse</b> <b>axonal</b> <b>injury</b> in the subacute and chronic time frames. [...] Newer studies such as Diffusion Tensor Imaging are able to demonstrate the degree of white matter fiber tract injury even when the standard MRI is negative. [...] Since axonal damage in DAI is largely a result of secondary biochemical cascades, it has a delayed onset, so a person with DAI who initially appears well may deteriorate later. [...] Thus injury is frequently more severe than is realized, and medical professionals should suspect DAI in any patients whose CT scans appear normal but who have symptoms like unconsciousness.|$|E
2500|$|The {{structural}} and functional diversity of calpains {{in the cell}} is reflected in their involvement in the pathogenesis {{of a wide range}} of disorders. At least two well known genetic disorders and one form of cancer have been linked to tissue-specific calpains. When defective, the mammalian calpain 3 (also known as p94) is the gene product responsible for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A, calpain 10 has been identified as a susceptibility gene for type II diabetes mellitus, and calpain 9 has been identified as a tumour suppressor for gastric cancer. Moreover, the hyperactivation of calpains is implicated in a number of pathologies associated with altered calcium homeostasis such as Alzheimer's disease, and cataract formation, as well as secondary degeneration resulting from acute cellular stress following myocardial ischemia, cerebral (neuronal) ischemia, traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury. Excessive amounts of calpain can be activated due to Ca2+ influx after cerebrovascular accident (during the ischemic cascade) or some types of traumatic brain injury such as <b>diffuse</b> <b>axonal</b> <b>injury.</b> Increase in concentration of calcium in the cell results in calpain activation, which leads to unregulated proteolysis of both target and non-target proteins and consequent irreversible tissue damage. Excessively active calpain breaks down molecules in the cytoskeleton such as spectrin, microtubule subunits, microtubule-associated proteins, and neurofilaments.-dependent mechanisms of cell injury in cultured cortical neurons |journal=Neuroscience |volume=86 |issue=4 |pages=1133–44 |date=October 1998 |pmid=9697120}} [...] It may also damage ion channels, other enzymes, cell adhesion molecules, and cell surface receptors. This can lead to degradation of the cytoskeleton and plasma membrane. [...] Calpain may also break down sodium channels that have been damaged due to axonal stretch injury, leading to an influx of sodium into the cell. [...] This, in turn, leads to the neuron's depolarization and the influx of more Ca2+. A significant consequence of calpain activation is the development of cardiac contractile dysfunction that follows ischemic insult to the heart. Upon reperfusion of the ischemic myocardium, there is development of calcium overload or excess in the heart cell (cardiomyocytes). This increase in calcium leads to activation of calpain.|$|E

Cortico-subcortical fiber density maps were derived by using probabilistic tractography from diffusion tensor imaging data acquired in 24 severe TBI patients and 9 healthy controls. These maps were compared between patients and controls as well as between patients with favorable (FO) and unfavorable (UFO) 1 -year outcome to identify the thalamo-cortical and ponto-thalamo-cortical pathways involved in the maintenance of consciousness. Thalamo-cortical and ponto-thalamo-cortical fiber density was significantly lower in TBI patients than in healthy controls. Comparing FO and UFO TBI patients showed thalamo-cortical deafferentation associated with unfavorable outcome for projections from ventral posterior and intermediate thalamic nuclei to the associative frontal, sensorimotor and associative temporal cortices. Specific ponto-thalamic deafferentation in projections from the upper dorsal pons (including the reticular formation) was also associated with unfavorable outcome.

Thus, absence of sleep spindles in coma could imply an absence of sleep elements and the consequent lack of sleep-wake cycles as measured by EEG. Given that human spindle generators are located in the thalamus, it is tempting to hypothesize that the absence of spindles in coma results from the interruption of either the ascending reticular thalamocortical pathway or of the thalamocortical loops [13, 33, 34]. Some earlier studies indicated that sleep spindles carry prognostic information [35]. It was subsequently shown that the presence of spindle after hypoxic or anoxic injury does not always indicate a good outcome and that the absence of spindles has been associated with a poor outcome [36].
