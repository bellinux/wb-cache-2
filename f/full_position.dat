Jones suggested in a BBC Radio Ulster interview in 2006 that Creationists should be disallowed from being medical doctors because [...] "all of its (Creationism's) claims fly {{in the face of}} the whole of science" [...] and he further claimed that no serious biologist can believe in biblical creation.

2500|$|With {{spinning}} reels, closed-face reels {{and conventional}} reels with star drags, {{a good starting}} point is to set the drag to about one-third to one-half the breaking strength of the line. For example, if the line is rated at [...] test, a drag setting that requires [...] of force on the line to move the spool would be appropriate. This is only a rule of thumb. For lever drag reels with a strike position, most anglers start by setting the drag at the strike position to one-third the break strength of the line. This usually allows the <b>full</b> <b>position</b> to still be safely under the line rating while providing flexibility during the fight. Depending on the conditions, some anglers may leave their reels in freespool then setting the anti-reverse or engaging the drag on hookup.|$|E

6000|$|When I {{said above}} that I {{believed}} in witches, {{but not in}} witch-smellers, I stated my <b>full</b> <b>position</b> about that conception of heredity, that half-formed philosophy of fears and omens; of curses and weird recurrence and darkness and the doom of blood, which, as preached to humanity to-day, is often more inhuman than witchcraft itself. I do not deny that this dark element exists; I only affirm that it is dark; or, in other words, that its most strenuous students are evidently {{in the dark about}} it. I would no more trust Dr. Karl Pearson on a heredity-hunt than on a heresy-hunt. I am perfectly ready to give my reasons for thinking this; and I believe any well-balanced person, if he reflects on them, will think as I do. There are two senses in which a man may be said to know or not know a subject. I know the subject of arithmetic, for instance; that is, I am not good at it, but I know what it is. I am sufficiently familiar with its use to see the absurdity of anyone who says, [...] "So vulgar a fraction cannot be mentioned before ladies," [...] or [...] "This unit is Unionist, I hope." [...] Considering myself for one moment as an arithmetician, I may say that I know next to nothing about my subject: but I know my subject. I know it in the street. There is the other kind of man, like Dr. Karl Pearson, who undoubtedly knows a vast amount about his subject; who undoubtedly lives in great forests of facts concerning kinship and inheritance. But it is not, by any means, the same thing to have searched the forests and to have recognised the frontiers. Indeed, the two things generally belong to two very different types of mind. I gravely doubt whether the Astronomer-Royal would write the best essay on the relations between astronomy and astrology. I doubt whether the President of the Geographical Society could give the best definition and history of the words [...] "geography" [...] and [...] "geology." ...|$|E

50|$|The AIS-P {{protocol}} is {{an alternative}} to the ADS-B and Mode S based TCAS protocols, and solves the problems of frequency congestion, by eliminating a requirement for multiple packet messages, or new longer packet definitions for ADS-B not established by international treaty, and by eliminating the 24 bit overhead for named identity in each packet of the message (required to tie multiple packets together into a message). One packet encodes latitude and longitude, altitude, direction, and speed (<b>full</b> <b>position</b> and velocity), handles error detection and recovery, along with channel use arbitration, in the AIS-P protocol.
