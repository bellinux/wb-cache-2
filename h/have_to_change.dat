5|$|The Stamford Bridge freehold, the pitch, the {{turnstiles}} and Chelsea's {{naming rights}} are {{now owned by}} Chelsea Pitch Owners, a non-profit organisation in which fans are the shareholders. The CPO was created to ensure the stadium could never again be sold to developers. As a condition for using the Chelsea FC name, the club has to play its first team matches at Stamford Bridge, which means that if the club moves to a new stadium, they may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> their name.|$|E
5|$|The {{conduct of}} Neymar, who {{performed}} tricks {{with the ball}} in the closing stages of Barcelona's victory, was a talking point after the match. His opponent Iraola decried Neymar, saying that his actions were unsporting, while Barcelona manager Luis Enrique said that Neymar's actions were common in Brazil, even though frowned upon in Spain, and would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> However, Neymar himself did not apologise and said that he would repeat his behaviour in the future.|$|E
5|$|The main {{design feature}} of the Mk. XIV was that it gave the bomb aimer more {{time to work on}} the problem of {{bringing}} the aircraft to the proper location to drop the bombs. As the calculations of this location were being carried out automatically, he could concentrate solely on the sight throughout the bomb run. The sight projected crosshairs into space so they were in focused at infinity, allowing the user to focus their eyes on the target and not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> focus to see the line.|$|E

5|$|Evan soon {{learns that}} 614 {{actually}} {{refers to the}} verse in the Book of Genesis, where God instructs Noah to build an Ark {{in preparation for a}} flood. God later repeatedly appears in various guises before finally revealing himself to Evan, and cordially insisting that he should also build an ark as well. God explains to Evan that a flood is coming, and that the only opportunity Evan will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the world is by saving his community instead. God also tells Evan to inform others about the flood should they ask him later. Concerned about Evan's behavior, Joan initially believes that he is having a mid-life crisis. Evan begins constructing the ark with his sons, who start to admire him as he is spending more time with them.|$|E
5|$|Ram Narayan {{was born}} on 25 December 1927 in Amber village, near Udaipur in northwestern India. His great-great-grandfather, Bagaji Biyavat, was a singer from Amber, and he and Narayan's great-grandfather, Sagad Danji Biyavat, sang at the court of the Maharana of Udaipur. Narayan's grandfather, Har Lalji Biyavat, and father, Nathuji Biyavat, were farmers and singers, Nathuji played the bowed {{instrument}} dilruba, and Narayan's mother was a music lover. Narayan's first language was Rajasthani and he learned Hindi and, later, English. At an age of about six, he found a small sarangi left by the family's Ganga guru, a genealogist, and was taught a fingering technique developed by his father. Narayan's father taught him, but {{was worried about the}} difficulty of playing the sarangi and its association with courtesan music, which gave the instrument a low social status. After a year, Biyavat sought lessons for his son from sarangi player Mehboob Khan of Jaipur, but changed his mind when Khan told him Narayan would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> his fingering technique. Narayan's father later encouraged him to leave school and devote himself to playing the sarangi.|$|E

25|$|Thus, {{numerous}} underlying cross-border {{problems are}} {{at the root of}} the difficulties of regional rail transport. A lack of track-sharing agreements means that a single operator moving goods through two or more countries is not feasible. This causes time-consuming and costly border operations - trains <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> locomotives and crews at each border crossing. There is no system of sealing wagons to avoid the need for customs inspections at borders or within transit countries.|$|E
25|$|A daily {{through train}} service {{operated}} between Cleethorpes and London King's Cross via Grimsby, Market Rasen and Lincoln Central {{until the late}} 1980s.

Passengers now <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> trains at Newark when travelling to and from London.

Locomotives would then <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> ends and the trains return to Clifton Hill station, where they diverged east on to the line to Heidelberg.|$|E

A frequent express service operates to Dewsbury, Leeds and Manchester and regular services to Darlington, Hull, Liverpool, Manchester Airport, Middlesbrough, Newcastle upon Tyne, Scarborough and York operated by TransPennine Express. There are local stopping services operated by Northern linking Huddersfield with Barnsley, Bradford, Brighouse, Dewsbury, Halifax, Leeds, Sheffield and Wakefield.|$|E

Since the mid-1980s, these express services have been routed via East Croydon in order to serve Gatwick Airport; passengers from Sutton for the south coast now <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> at Horsham, or alternatively travel to West Croydon station and walk, take the bus or use Croydon's Tramlink service to reach East Croydon station.|$|E
