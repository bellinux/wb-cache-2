5|$|How {{were such}} effects produced, {{and how did}} they look? The {{crocodile}} etc. obviously used the floor trap, but was it an illusionistically painted figure worked with sticks, or a man in a crocodile suit? There are no extant drawings or descriptions of machinery and sets for the Restoration theatre, although some documentation exists for court masques from {{the first half of the}} 17th century, notably the work of Inigo Jones and his pupil John Webb. One reason for the lack of information for the public theatres is that stage effects, and particularly machines, were trade secrets. Inventors of theatrical effects took <b>great</b> <b>pains</b> to hold on to their secrets, and the playhouses guarded their machine workings as zealously as a magician guards her or his tricks.|$|E
5|$|Avery Brundage had no {{children}} with either of his wives. During his first marriage, however, Brundage fathered two sons out of wedlock with his Finnish mistress, Lilian Dresden. His affair with Dresden was one of many. The children were born in 1951 and 1952, at precisely the time that Brundage was being considered for {{the presidency of the}} IOC. Though he privately acknowledged paternity, Brundage took <b>great</b> <b>pains</b> to conceal the existence of these children, concerned that the truth about his extra-marital relationships might damage his chances of election: he requested that his name be kept off the birth certificates. Brundage visited his two sons periodically in the 1950s, visits that tailed off to telephone calls in the 1960s and nothing in his final years. He did establish a trust fund for the boys' education and start in life, but after his death, unnamed in his will, they sued and won a small settlement of $62,500 each out of his $19 million estate.|$|E

40|$|Sixty healthy men {{and women}} {{experienced}} experimentally-induced pain during exposure to either a pleasant odour (lemon), an unpleasant odour (machine oil) or no odour. Participants reported the degree of pain they experienced at five minute intervals for 15 minutes. Individuals exposed to both odours reported significantly <b>greater</b> <b>pain</b> than did {{the participants in the}} control condition at five minutes. At 15 minutes, individuals exposed to the unpleasant odour experienced <b>greater</b> <b>pain</b> than did the control group. The results suggest that exposure to odour is not beneficial to those seeking pain relief. Rather, its perception is associated with <b>greater</b> <b>pain</b> than is no odour...|$|R

Caplan says that Rothbard did not understand the position he was attacking, because microeconomic theorists go to <b>great</b> <b>pains</b> to show that their results hold for any monotonic transformation of an ordinal utility function, and do not entail cardinal utility.|$|E

Several busloads of workers, under threat of being fired, arrived in Bucharest's Piața Palatului (Palace Square, now Piața Revoluției – Revolution Square) and were given red flags, banners and large pictures of Ceaușescu.

25|$|Because witness {{intimidation}} {{had been such}} an important issue during the initial trial, witness protection was a prominent feature in both trials. During both trial the Prosecution took <b>great</b> <b>pains</b> to protect the identity of witnesses called to testify. This often included, voice modification, pseudonyms, {{and in some cases}} witness relocation. During the retrial, the Court took the extraordinary measure of moving the entire court to an undisclosed secret location in order to secure the testimony of a protected witness. These efforts paid off.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the sixteenth}} century, {{it has been}} widely held that the Aztec Emperor Moctezuma II {{initially}} believed the landing of Hernán Cortés in 1519 to be Quetzalcoatl's return. This view has been questioned by ethno-historians who argue that the Quetzalcoatl-Cortés connection is not found in any document that was created independently of post-Conquest Spanish influence, {{and that there is}} little proof of a pre-Hispanic belief in Quetzalcoatl's return. Most documents expounding this theory are of entirely Spanish origin, such as Cortés's letters to Charles V of Spain, in which Cortés goes to <b>great</b> <b>pains</b> to present the naive gullibility of the Aztecs in general as a great aid in his conquest of Mexico.|$|E

25|$|When Yeo {{arrived at}} the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) in 2001, he found that fewer than 20% of PhD holders in A*STAR's institutes were Singaporean, and few among them were young scientists. Yeo {{immediately}} set up his boldest scholarship yet by setting up the A*STAR Graduate Academy to implement the plan to train up 1,000 PhD scholars that would eventually return to Singapore and undertake research in fields like information technology, engineering, molecular biology, biochemistry and medicine. One {{of the hallmarks of}} Yeo's personal style is the amount of personal attention he gives to his scholars. He takes <b>great</b> <b>pains</b> to remember personal details about their background and also closely tracks their academic performance. He regularly meets with them to buy them meals whenever he is near their overseas universities on his regular business trips abroad.|$|E
25|$|Watson's {{merger of}} {{diplomacy}} and business {{was not always}} lauded. During the 1930s, IBM's German subsidiary was its most profitable foreign operation, and a 2001 book by Edwin Black, IBM and the Holocaust, argues that Watson's pursuit of profit led him to personally approve and spearhead IBM's strategic technological relationship with Nazi Germany. In particular, critics point to the coveted Order of the German Eagle medal that Watson received at the Berlin ICC meeting in 1937, as evidence {{that he was being}} honored for the help that IBM's German subsidiary Dehomag (Deutsche Hollerith-Maschinen Gesellschaft mbH) and its punch card machines provided the Nazi regime, particularly in the tabulation of census data (i.e. location of Jews). Another study argues that Watson believed, perhaps naively, that the medal was in recognition of his years of labor on behalf of global commerce and international peace. Within a year of the Berlin congress though, where Watson's hopes had run high, he found himself strongly protesting the German policy toward the Jews. Because of his strong feelings about the issue, Watson wanted to return his German citation shortly after receiving it. When Secretary of State Hull advised him against that course of action, he gave up the idea until the spring of 1940. Then Hull refused advice, and Watson sent the medal back in June 1940. Dehomag's management disapproved of Watson's action and considered separating from IBM. This occurred when Germany declared war on the United States in December 1941, and the German shareholders took custody of the Dehomag operation. But during World War II, IBM subsidiaries in occupied Europe never stopped delivery of punch cards to Dehomag, and documents uncovered show that senior executives at IBM world headquarters in New York took <b>great</b> <b>pains</b> to maintain legal authority over Dehomag's operations and assets through the personal intervention of IBM managers in neutral Switzerland, directed via personal communications and private letters.|$|E

Conrad's input proved useful in making the scenes set in weightlessness as convincing as the budget would allow. Assistance was also received from an aerospace manufacturer, the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, who provided stock footage of astronauts training in a water tank and received an on-screen credit on the first episode [...] "An Instinct for Murder".|$|E
500|$|As it was {{intended}} to be Nimoy's last portrayal of Spock, the actor was adamant that his appearance be faithful to the original 1960s Fred Phillips and Charlie Schram design of the character. Mills consulted photos from the original television series as reference, and created five ear sculptings before Nimoy was satisfied. The result was tall ears with the tips pointing forward—considerably different from Richard Snell's swept-back look for The Voyage Home. The character of Valeris was designed to be more ivory-hued than Spock's yellow tone, with sleeker eyebrows and a severe haircut favored by Meyer. [...] "We went to <b>great</b> <b>pains</b> to establish {{that this is the way}} a Vulcan woman—a sexy Vulcan woman—would look," [...] said Mills.|$|E

In this study, injections were administered by 1 of 3 approaches; however, there is currently no consensus on which, if any, of these techniques produce a more favorable outcome. To provide additional insight on this topic, {{the results of the}} previous trial were reanalyzed to determine whether (1) the effect of Cingal was significant within each injection technique and (2) pain reductions were similar between injection techniques across all treatment groups. <b>Greater</b> <b>pain</b> reductions with Cingal up to 3 [*]weeks were only significant in the anteromedial subgroup. Across all therapies, both the anteromedial and anterolateral techniques demonstrated significantly <b>greater</b> <b>pain</b> reductions than the lateral midpatellar approach at 18 and 26 [*]weeks...|$|R
