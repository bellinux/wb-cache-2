2500|$|The Series II Land Rover was a sales success, {{but there}} was still room for improvements. In 1962 the {{slightly}} altered Series IIA was launched. As well as some suspension and steering system changes, the biggest update was an <b>improved</b> <b>diesel</b> <b>engine.</b> This shared many parts with its petrol-fuelled sibling, including the block, valve gear, cooling systems and lubrication systems. A forged crankshaft was used for added strength, and different pistons were needed. The cylinder head used the same basic casting, but was very different internally, being in essence an updated version of that used on the original 2-litre engine, to which the new diesel bore a strong external resemblance. Like the 2.25-litre petrol, the 2.25-litre diesel was a dry-liner design. It was built on the same production line as the petrol engine and the flexibility of the basic design was much in evidence- for example, where the diesel engines had their fuel injector pumps, the petrol engine had its distributor fitted. Although it offered a modest improvement in power and a useful jump in torque, the main benefit of the new diesel engine was that it was much quieter and more efficient than the older unit. It also proved to be much more reliable in service. Like the petrol engine, the diesel was upgraded to a 5-bearing crankshaft in 1980. The engine was fitted to the Austin FX4 Black Cab between 1982 and 1985. FX4s fitted with the engine were designated 'FX4R' ('R' for 'Rover'). In this application the engine gained a reputation for very short service life and unreliability. This was caused by the significantly greater times spent at idle speed in the Black Cab than in the Land Rover. Solihull engineers had warned Carbodies, builders of the FX4R that this would cause problems as at idle speed the engine's oil pressure dropped, causing the automatic tensioner unit for the timing chain to not operate fully. At the high number of hours spent at idle speed (taxi drivers tended to leave the engines idling for long period whilst waiting for passengers or when off-duty as well as all the time spent in stationary traffic in London) this caused the timing chains to stretch, causing incorrect fuel injection timing which greatly reduced engine life.

The approach applied in the article makes it possible to reveal the existing and modify the existing methods of solving the problem of <b>improving</b> <b>diesel</b> <b>engine’s</b> efficiency with due regard to interrelation of the parameters, characterizing efficiency of their operation.

Interrelation between volume combustion rate, nominal parameters of diesel operation and efficiency indices, obtained by processing statistical data of more than 500 models of diesels of different series was evaluated, the main feature of it being a mathematical trend.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in computer hardware and algorithms {{make it possible}} to consider more computationally demanding control methods, allowing more effective exploitation of the equipment under control. This thesis explores new ways of controlling ships (or other marine vessels) that are designed to keep a pre-determined position and heading automatically exclusively by the means of their thrusters – a task called “Dynamic Positioning”, or DP. Special attention is given to the interplay between the thruster system and the power plant that supplies it. A DP control architecture typically consists of at least 1) a DP control algorithm that considers the current position and velocity of the vessel against the DP setpoint, and calculates the total forces and the moment that the thruster system should produce, and 2) a thrust allocation (TA) algorithm that calculates the forces to be produced by the individual thrusters to match the command from the DP control algorithm. Chapter 2 describes a TA algorithm that enables centralized control over the power consumption in the thruster system. It achieves that by allowing the TA to make short-term deviations from the command it receives from the DP control algorithm; the resulting deviations in position and velocity of the vessel are carefully monitored and constrained, and are usually small due to the large inertia of a typical marine vessel. This enables the thrusters to counter-act load variations from other consumers on the ship, reducing the total variations on the power plant. The TA algorithm is tested on a simulated marine vessel, which includes a realistic marine power plant. In Chapter 3, a more efficient version of this algorithm is described. The improvement in efficiency is achieved by positioning the vessel against the slowlyvarying component of the environmental forces in a way that increases the acceptable deviation margins in the likely drift-off direction. In Chapter 4, the capabilities of the thruster system to control its power consumption are examined from a theoretical perspective. Much of the work above required a mathematical model of the power output from a diesel engine; a model that is well-suited for controller design and verification purposes was designed based on first-principle models in the literature. This model was then used to design an <b>improved</b> <b>diesel</b> <b>engine</b> governor (controller) algorithm, which is described in Chapter 5. The TA algorithms that are described in the literature usually focus on solving one or a few aspects of the TA problem at a time. In Chapter 6, functionality from several earlier publications is gathered into a single TA algorithm. The singularity avoidance functionality is given additional theoretical treatment. Implementing a DP control algorithm that is aware of thruster limitations such as saturations and rotation rate constraints involves largely heuristic adaptions. Chapter 7 introduces a DP control architecture that avoids having separate DP and TA algorithms, and is instead based on a single MPC-based controller. This allows better coordination between control of the thrusters and control of the ship. PhD i teknisk kybernetikkPhD in Engineering Cybernetic...|$|E

40|$|About 2. 1 {{billion gallons}} of fuel ethanol {{was used in the}} United States in 2002, mainly in the form of {{gasoline}} blends containing up to 10 % ethanol (E 10). Ethanol use has the potential to increase in the U.

Ethanol would remain the only viable near-term option as an oxygenate in reformulated gasoline production and to meet a potential federal renewable fuels standard (RFS) for transportation fuels. Ethanol may also be blended with additives (co-solvents) into diesel fuels for applications in which oxygenation may <b>improve</b> <b>diesel</b> <b>engine</b> emission performance. Numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate the fuel-cycle energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission effects of ethanol-gasoline blends relative to those of gasoline for applications in spark-ignition engine vehicles (see Wang et al. 1997; Wang et al. 1999; Levelton Engineering et al. 1999; Shapouri et al. 2002; Graboski 2002). Those studies did not address the energy and emission effects of ethanol-diesel (E-diesel or ED) blends relative to those of petroleum diesel fuel in <b>diesel</b> <b>engine</b> vehicles. The energy and emission effects of E-diesel could be very different from those of ethanol-gasoline blends because (1) the energy use and emissions generated during diesel production (so-called ''upstream'' effects) are different from those generated during gasoline production; and (2) the energy and emission performance of E-diesel and petroleum diesel fuel in <b>diesel</b> compression-ignition <b>engines</b> differs from that of ethanol-gasoline blends in spark-ignition (Otto-cycle-type) engine vehicles.

40|$|The main {{driving force}} behind this {{research}} was the need for cleaner and more efficient engines to meet the ever-increasing demands on the modern automobile’s emissions. In recent years different studies {{have been carried out}} to analyze the combined effects of high-pressure injection, boost pressure, multiple injections, included spray angle and combustion chamber geometry. Though considerable research has shown these technologies can meet the low emission regulations, the careful optimization of the engine operating conditions is still required {{in order to get the}} full benefit of the different strategies. With these issues as motivation, the first important objective of this study was to gain a detailed understanding of the mechanisms through which fuel injection interacts with other engine parameters and influences diesel combustion and emissions, and hence to attempt to generalize the adoption of multiple injection strategies with regards to <b>improving</b> <b>diesel</b> <b>engine</b> performance. For this purpose, a modified parameter called “Homogeneity Factor of in-cylinder charge” (HF) was introduced and proposed as a new measure in combustion theory to analyze the combustion characteristics and air-fuel mixing process of <b>diesel</b> <b>engines</b> in more detail. The second part of this research builds upon a detail investigation on the included spray cone angle concept and explores further their use in conjunction with multiple-injection strategies in <b>diesel</b> <b>engines.</b> In addition, an investigation was performed in third phase of this research to analyze the effects of piston geometry on combustion, performance and exhaust emission characteristics. The results showed that employing a post-injection combined with a pilot injection results in reduced soot formation from diffusion combustion and enhances the soot oxidation process during the expansion stroke, resulting in decreased soot emissions, while the NOx concentration is maintained in low levels. It was also found that spray targeting is very effective for controlling the in-cylinder mixture distributions especially when it accompanied with advanced injection strategies.

The project scope also included novel materials for use in advanced components and designs associated with waste-heat recovery and other concepts for improved thermal efficiency. Caterpillar initially provided ORNL with a 2004 Tier 2 C 15 ACERT <b>diesel</b> <b>engine</b> (designed for on-highway use) and two 600 hp motoring dynamometers. The {{first year of the}} CRADA effort was focused on establishing a heavy-duty experimental engine research cell. First year activities included procuring, installing and commissioning the cell infrastructure. Infrastructure components consisted of intake air handling system, water tower, exhaust handling system, and cell air conditioning. Other necessary infrastructure items included the fuel delivery system and bottled gas handling to support the analytical instrumentation. The second year of the CRADA focused on commissioning the dynamometer system to enable engine experimentation. In addition to the requirements associated with the dynamometer controller, the electrical system needed a power factor correction system to maintain continuity with the electrical grid. During the second year the engine was instrumented and baseline operated to confirm performance and commission the dynamometer. The engine performance was mapped and modeled according to requirements provided by Caterpillar. This activity was further supported by a Work-for-Others project from Caterpillar to evaluate a proprietary modeling system. A second Work-for-Others activity was performed to evaluate a novel turbocharger design. This project was highly successful and may lead to new turbocharger designs for Caterpillar heavy-duty <b>diesel</b> <b>engines.</b> During the third (and final) year of the CRADA, a novel valve material was evaluated to assess high temperature performance and durability.

40|$|This article {{demonstrates}} {{a possibility for}} increasing the power output from <b>diesel</b> <b>engines</b> and <b>improving</b> the fuel economy for such engines. This is achieved by employing a power cycle which is driven solely by the engine waste-heat in the cooling water and, also, the exhaust gases. For road engines an organic fluid Rankine cycle is employed. R- 12 is evaporated in a boiler, fired by the coolant waste-heat. This is superheated using the exhaust-gases before it is introduced to a turbine where it expands down to an air-cooled condenser. The cycle power output can supplement the base engine power by about 16 % of its output. For stationary <b>diesel</b> <b>engines,</b> however, water is used in a steam Brayton power cycle.

40|$|Societal {{concerns}} on combustion-based {{fuel consumption}} are ever-increasing. With respect to internal combustion engines, this translates to {{a need to}} increase brake fuel conversion efficiency (BFCE). <b>Diesel</b> <b>engines</b> are a relatively efficient internal combustion engine to consider for numerous applications, but associated actions to mitigate certain exhaust emissions have generally deteriorated <b>engine</b> efficiency. Conventionally, <b>diesel</b> <b>engine</b> emission control has centered on in-cylinder techniques. Although these continue to hold promise, the industry trend is presently favoring the use of after-treatment devices which create new opportunities to <b>improve</b> the <b>diesel</b> <b>engine's</b> brake fuel conversion efficiency. This study focuses on injection timing effects on the combustion processes, engine efficiency, and the engine system's responses. The engine in the study is a medium duty <b>diesel</b> <b>engine</b> (capable of meeting US EPA Tier III off road emission standards) equipped with common rail direct fuel injection, variable geometry turbo charging, and interfaced with a custom built engine controller. The study found that injection timing greatly affected BFCE by changing the combustion phasing. BFCE would increase up to a maximum then begin to decrease as phasing became less favorable. Combustion phasing would change from being mostly mixing controlled combustion to premixed combustion as injection timing would advance allowing more time for fuel to mix during the ignition delay. Combustion phasing, in turn, would influence many other engine parameters. As injection timing is advanced, in-cylinder temperatures and pressures amplify, and intake and exhaust manifold pressures deteriorate. Rate of heat release and rate of heat transfer increase when injection timing is advanced. Turbocharger speed falls with the advancing injection timing. Torque, however, rose to a maximum then fell off again even though engine speed and fueling rate were held constant between different injection timings. Interestingly, the coefficient of heat transfer changes from a two peak curve to a smooth one peak curve as the injection timing is advanced further. The major conclusion {{of the study is}} that injection advance both positively and negatively influences the <b>diesel</b> <b>engine's</b> response which contributes to the brake fuel conversion efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Using {{vegetable}} oils directly {{as an alternative}} diesel fuel has presented engine problems. The problems {{have been attributed to}} high viscosity of vegetable oil that causes the poor atomization of fuel in the injector system and pruduces uncomplete combustion. Therefore, it is necessary to convert the vegetable oil into ester (metil ester) by tranesterification process to decrease its viscosity. In this research has made biodiesel by reaction of palm oil and methanol using lye (NaOH) as catalyst with operation conditions: constant temperature at 60 oC in atmosferic pressure, palm oil : methanol volume ratio = 5 : 1, amount of NaOH used as catalyst = 3. 5 gr, 4. 5 gr, 5 gr and 5. 5 gr and it takes about one hour time reaction. The ester (metil ester) produced are separated from glycerin and washed until it takes normal pH (6 - 7) where more amount of catalyst used will decrease the ester (biodiesel) produced. The results show that biodiesels' properties made by using 3. 5 (M 3. 5) gr, 4. 5 gr (M 4. 5) and 5 (M 5. 0) gr catalyst close to industrial diesel oil and the other (M 5. 5) closes to automotive diesel oil, while blending diesel oil with 20 % biodiesel (B 20) is able to <b>improve</b> the <b>diesel</b> <b>engine</b> performances. <br...|$|R
40|$|Turbocharged <b>diesel</b> <b>engines</b> {{suffer from}} poor drivability, mostly at low loads and speeds, leading also to {{overshoot}} in exhaust emissions (primarily PM/soot and NOx) during the transient operation after a speed or load increase. The main cause for this problematic behavior {{is located in}} the turbocharger in the form of high moment of inertia and unfavorable aerodynamic-type compressor flow characteristics. In the present work, various alternative turbocharging configurations are reviewed that have proven successful in <b>improving</b> the dynamic <b>diesel</b> <b>engine</b> operation. The configurations studied are: combined supercharging, variable geometry turbine, electrically assisted turbocharging, two stage series and sequential turbocharging, as well as lower turbine moment of inertia. It is shown that significant improvement in the engine’s transient response can be realized through reduction in the turbocharger mass moment of inertia (using lighter materials and/or more than one units). Increasing the available turbine torque (e. g. through elevated turbine back pressure in a variable-geometry turbine) is another successful option, as well as enhancement of the compressor boost pressure (e. g. {{through the use of a}} positive displacement compressor upstream of the turbocharger). Finally, the use of external energy (e. g. in the form of electrical assistance on the turbocharger shaft during the critical turbocharger lag phase) is another recently developed and highly promising measure to mitigate the drawbacks of the poor transient performance of turbocharged diesel-engined vehicles and limit their exhaust emissions...|$|R
