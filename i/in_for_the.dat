5|$|A {{few of the}} Acadians {{migrating}} to the Miramichi River probably died of hypothermia during the trip due to the 1758–59 winter. Those who survived joined the refugees already present, who had been persuaded by Boishébert to seek refuge there. Inadequate housing and supplies, among other reasons, led to {{the deterioration of the}} reputation of the French commander, and only 700 Acadians remained there by late 1759. Meanwhile, the raiding rapidly took its toll on the residents who stayed around the Three Rivers, as food supplies became scarce and reconstruction became impossible. The fall of Quebec City in September 1759 also eliminated the possibility of assistance from that area. On 16 November 1759, the 190 Acadians in the region sent a delegate to Fort Beauséjour (which had been renamed Fort Cumberland) to announce their surrender to the newly promoted Colonel Frye. The settlements of Miramichi, Richibucto, and Bouctouche surrendered the next day, with a delegate sent to the fort to represent their 700 refugees. Frye requested and received permission from Governor Lawrence to take them <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> winter. The Acadian refugees were offered land on the Isthmus of Chignecto in early 1760, but most requested their original lands around the Three Rivers, which the governor granted.|$|E
5|$|After {{directing}} The Search for Spock, {{cast member}} Leonard Nimoy {{was asked to}} direct the next feature, and given greater freedom regarding the film's content. Nimoy and producer Harve Bennett conceived a story with an environmental message and no clear-cut villain. Dissatisfied with the first screenplay produced by Steve Meerson and Peter Krikes, Paramount hired The Wrath of Khan writer and director Nicholas Meyer. Meyer and Bennett divided the story between them and wrote {{different parts of the}} script, requiring approval from Nimoy, lead actor William Shatner, and Paramount. Principal photography commenced on February 24, 1986. Unlike previous Star Trek films, The Voyage Home was shot extensively on location; many real settings and buildings were used as stand-ins for scenes set around and in the city of San Francisco. Special effects firm Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) assisted in post-production and the film's special effects. Few of the humpback whales in the film were real: ILM devised full-size animatronics and small motorized models to stand <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> real creatures.|$|E

Realizing he requires a guard to get through the retinal scanner that locks the doors to the space port, Riddick decides to go after Abbott and take his eyes. He gains access to Abbott's apartment by telling him there is a delivery for him. A fire fight ensues and after that, as Abbott bleeds out on the floor, Riddick moves <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> kill but is stopped by Johns.|$|E

5|$|After the war, {{he resumed}} with Victoria, but faced {{a lot of}} {{competition}} for a place as an opening batsman in the Australian team. He played his only Test in the 1946-47 Ashes series at the Adelaide Oval, filling <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> injured Sid Barnes. Scoring 12 and 31, he partnered Arthur Morris in a second innings opening stand of 116. After a further two first-class seasons, Harvey retired after being dropped from Victoria's first-choice team. He ended with a record of 1,147 first-class runs at 38.23 in 22 matches. This included three centuries, and he captained Victoria five times, winning one matchthe rest were drawn. His career highlight was an innings of 136 in December 1946 against New South Wales, when he hooked a bouncer from Ray Lindwall into the MCG public bar and featured in a partnership of 271 with Keith Miller. His highest score was 163 against South Australia at Adelaide. Harvey continued playing for Fitzroy until 1954-55, and he finished with 6,654 runs at an average of 29.31 in 207 First XI matches for the club.|$|E
5|$|After {{traveling}} to New York {{to perform the}} first seven episodes, the four men decided to broadcast from Los Angeles instead. NBC {{did not have a}} studio on the West Coast, so for the next thirteen weeks, between January 16 and April 24, 1933, the show was transmitted from a borrowed empty soundstage at RKO Radio Pictures. Folding chairs were brought <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> audience of around thirty or forty people – coming from vaudeville, Groucho and Chico preferred to perform to a crowd – and were quickly cleared {{out at the end of}} each performance so that the stage would be ready for any filming the following day.

5|$|Against the Baltimore Ravens in {{the preseason}} opener on August 11, Kafka {{replaced}} Young at quarterback during the second quarter and played into the fourth quarter. He went 13-of-19 for 132yards with one interception thrown to Ravens safety Bernard Pollard in the game. In {{the second week of}} the preseason on August 18 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Kafka entered the game in the fourth quarter and led the Eagles to two scoring drives in a 24–14 loss. With less than four minutes remaining in the game, he threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Gerald Jones, and with only 19 seconds left on the following drive, threw a second touchdown pass to Jones for sevenyards. He finished the game going 14-for-19 for 160yards along with the two scores. Kafka played in garbage time in the next preseason game against the Cleveland Browns, handing the ball off twice and kneeling down twice. Against the New York Jets {{in the preseason}} finale, he filled <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> injured Young, who started the game, to start the third quarter. Kafka had the wind knocked out of him on a sack, but was able to play the rest of the game despite a rib contusion. He finished the game 7-for-11 for 76yards and one interception. He went 34-for-49 for 369yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions in the preseason overall.|$|E
5|$|Albion's sole goalscoring {{opportunity}} {{of the second}} half came afterwards; Clark took the ball on a lengthy run before crossing it into the box, across an open goal with no Albion player there to tap the ball in and put the game beyond QPR's reach. Fifteen minutes {{from the end of the}} match QPR equalised, Marsh's shot with his right foot went in off the post. A corner followed for QPR who were now dominating Albion with their style of play. Allen crossed it in to Lazarus, but the Albion goalkeeper saved the shot with his legs. With eight minutes to go, one of Albion defenders mis-kicked the ball in their own penalty area. Hunt rushed <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> chance but Sheppard once again saved the game for Albion. The ball ran free to Mike Lazarus who tapped the ball into the back of an empty net to increase the scoreline to 3–2 in QPR's favour. A final attack from QPR came in the closing moments of the game as Lazarus took the ball past two defenders and into the box, his subsequent shot hit the outside of the post and went wide.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) orders Darryl to hire {{replacements}} for the warehouse staff, but Darryl is wallowing in his depression and neglects to {{even look at}} the applications. With an order due out for one of Phyllis Vance's (Phyllis Smith) most important clients, Andy asks for volunteers to step <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> day {{and make sure that}} the order is shipped out. Jim, Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) take over the process, (however, in a talking-head interview, Kevin states that he will deliberately do a poor job because he did not volunteer and was merely suggested for the job because of his large size), but {{do not know how to}} use the heavy-lifting equipment and balk at the notion of carrying all the heavy boxes by hand. Upon Kevin's suggestion, they create an oil luge to slide the boxes across the floor resulting in a lot of damaged inventory. They retool Kevin's idea throughout the day, resulting in still more damaged inventory, and Phyllis ultimately loses the client.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 2001 {{and into}} 2002, CZW's {{territory}} (that is, the area at which they held {{the majority of their}} events) was shifting from Sewell, New Jersey to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in order to hold events regularly at the old ECW arena, beginning with December 15's Cage of Death 3. At this event, they faced Nick Gage and Nate Hatred, but wore masks and were identified as The Midnight Outlaws. This was likely to get around the fact that Jay was only 17 and Mark only 16 at the time; this meant, as they were under 18 years of age, that they could not legally work in a sport wrestling exhibition in the state of Pennsylvania. As CZW regularly began holding shows in the Philadelphia area, the Midnight Outlaws made appearances at the next four CZW events. At A Higher Level of Pain on April 13, 2002, Jay appeared across the ring from the Midnight Outlaws, tagging with Ruckus against Mark and someone else. By this time, he had turned 18. Jay and Ruckus were won the match, and this was the last time either Jay or Mark appeared for CZW until April 12, 2003, where Jay and Mark both returned for Best of the Best 3. Jay was a surprise entrant after being taunted by A.J. Styles, and Mark filling <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> injured Ruckus. Jay advanced to the semi finals, where he lost to B-Boy, and Mark lost his fill-in match to Sonjay Dutt. The two faced off with the Backseat Boyz for the CZW World Tag Team Championship at Truth or Consequences on June 14, but failed to win the belts.|$|E
5|$|Both The Pleasure Garden and The Mountain Eagle were {{produced}} in co-operation with Emelka Film Studios in Munich, Germany.

5|$|Both clubs {{having been}} {{eliminated}} from the FA Cup, Small Heath arranged a friendly with Notts County, refereed by the Test cricketer and former England international footballer Billy Gunn, which gave {{them an opportunity to}} try out reserve players Jack Jones and Alec Leake. On a hard, snow-covered pitch, Billy Walton scored all three goals in a 3–3 draw, but the attendance of under a thousand, though understandable because of the weather conditions, was disappointing. Jones made his competitive debut, standing <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> injured Hallam, as Small Heath again struggled in muddy conditions and, for the fourth time this season, lost to West Bromwich Albion.|$|E

5|$|Croyle {{started his}} first home game at Arrowhead Stadium on November 25 against the Oakland Raiders, but injured {{his back in}} the 20–17 loss. The injury sidelined Croyle for the {{following}} week's game against the San Diego Chargers, and Damon Huard started in Croyle's place. The injured quarterbacks continued to rotate playing time, and Croyle was again declared the starter for Kansas City's game against the Denver Broncos on December 9. The plan, barring injury, was for Croyle to start the remaining games of the 2007 season, so that coach Herm Edwards and his staff could better evaluate him moving forward into 2008. However, Croyle bruised his hand while trying to stop a defender from running an interception in for a touchdown and Damon Huard, who was the only active quarterback on the Chiefs' roster besides Croyle, filled <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> remainder of the game.|$|E

5|$|Dining hall {{protocol}} was a scripted process, including a whistle system to indicate which block and tier of men would move {{into and out}} of the hall at any given time, who sat where, where to place hands, and when to start eating. Prisoners would be awakened at 6:30, and sent to breakfast at 6:55. A breakfast menu is still preserved on the hallway board, dated 21 March 1963. The breakfast menu included assorted dry cereals, steamed whole wheat, a scrambled egg, milk, stewed fruit, toast, bread, and butter. Lunch was served in the dining hall at 11:20, followed by a 30-minute rest in the cell, before returning to work until 16:15. Dinner was served at 16:25 and the prisoners would then retire to their cells at 16:50 to be locked <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> night. Inmates were permitted to eat as much as they liked within 20 minutes, provided they left no waste; waste would be reported and may make the prisoner subject to removal of privileges if they made a habit of it.|$|E
