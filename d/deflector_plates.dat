5|$|Smoke-lifting {{devices were}} not a {{priority}} with the normal single-chimney Pacifics. However, with its double chimney and subsequent fitting of a double Kylchap exhaust in 1937, Humorist continued to pose a problem in this regard and always had small wings {{on either side of}} the chimney. Finally, in the 1950s, it acquired the Peppercorn-type of <b>deflector</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|E
5|$|The last {{modification}} of the class undertaken by Maunsell was the gradual introduction of small smoke <b>deflector</b> <b>plates</b> from 1934. These were fitted to improve driver visibility {{as a result of}} smoke deflection experiments made on the King Arthur class between 1926 and 1927. Maunsell retired from the Southern Railway in 1937 and his replacement was Oliver Bulleid. Despite making various modifications to the steam circuit on other Maunsell classes, Bulleid saw no reason to make such drastic alterations to the N1class. As a result, the final set of modifications made under Southern Railway ownership was made after the Second World War and included the removal of superfluous smokebox-mounted anti-vacuum snifting valves and the replacement of the wide-diameter N1 chimney with the U1 type to improve draughting on the prototype; the standard Nclass chimneys of the other five were also replaced. The class was well-used by British Railways over both Central and Eastern sections between 1948 and 1962 and justified the fitting of Automatic Warning System (AWS) equipment in 1959 alongside the Nclass.|$|E

40|$|This paper summarises the two part work {{carried out}} during project 7 of work package 3 of the EU funded {{research}} project AMEDEO. At first, {{the outcome of}} a practical application and extension of a numerical coupled FEA-CFD methodology is presented. Extensive use is made of FEA (solids) and CFD (fluid) modelling techniques to understand the thermo-mechanical behaviour of a turbine stator well cavity, due to the interaction of cooling air supply with the main annulus. In this investigation, two different geometries (baseline and a <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> design) with a specific amount of cooling air are modelled and the impact of the structural deflections on the heat transfer is investigated. The second part focuses on a CFD-based automated optimisation of a turbine stator well (TSW) geometry with an included stationary <b>deflector</b> <b>plate.</b> Experiments as well as numerical simulations have shown that due to the <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> the cooling flow is fed more directly into the disc boundary layer, allowing more effective use of less cooling air, leading to improved engine efficiency. Therefore, the <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> geometry is embedded in an automated optimisation loop to further reduce the amount of cooling air. The optimisation strategy concentrates on a flexible design parameterisation of the cavity geometry with <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> and its implementation in an automatic 3 D meshing system. The parameterised geometry is optimised using a metamodel-assisted approach based on regressing Kriging in order to identify the optimum position and orientation of the <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> inside the cavity...|$|R
50|$|The firebox {{door was}} also of novel design. As the {{backplate}} sloped so steeply, {{the door was}} top-hinged and opened inwards, rather than outwards. This also {{had the effect of}} acting as a <b>deflector</b> <b>plate,</b> directing the cold draught down onto the firebed, rather than directly across and into the tubes.|$|R
40|$|At present, it is {{a common}} {{practice}} to expose engine components to main annulus air temperatures exceeding the thermal material limit in order to increase the overall engine performance and to minimize the engine specific fuel consumption. To prevent overheating of the materials and thus the reduction of component life, an internal flow system is required to cool and protect the critical engine parts. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} insertion of a <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> in turbine cavities leads to a more effective use of reduced cooling air, since the coolant is fed more effectively into the disk boundary layer. This paper describes a flexible design parameterization of an engine representative turbine stator well geometry with stationary <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> and its implementation within an automated design optimization process using automatic meshing and steady-state computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Special attention and effort is turned to the flexibility of the parameterization method in order to reduce the number of design variables to a minimum on the one hand, but increasing the design space flexibility and generality on the other. Finally, the optimized design is evaluated using a previously validated conjugate heat transfer method (by coupling a finite element analysis (FEA) to CFD) and compared against both the nonoptimized deflector design and a reference baseline design without a <b>deflector</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|R
25|$|Despite this, a {{dedicated}} single-seat fighter version {{was built in}} 1915, armed with an 8mm Hotchkiss machine gun that fired through the propeller arc, the propeller blades being protected by <b>deflector</b> <b>plates.</b> Only one or two prototypes were built, and the type never entered service.|$|E
25|$|The {{electron}} beam, {{which typically}} has an energy ranging from 0.2 keV to 40 keV, is focused {{by one or}} two condenser lenses to a spot about 0.4nm to 5nm in diameter. The beam passes through pairs of scanning coils or pairs of <b>deflector</b> <b>plates</b> in the electron column, typically in the final lens, which deflect the beam in the x and y axes so that it scans in a raster fashion over a rectangular area of the sample surface.|$|E
25|$|Wood-burners emit large {{quantities}} of flying sparks which necessitate an efficient spark-arresting device generally housed in the smokestack. Many different types were fitted, the most common early type being the Bonnet stack that incorporated a cone-shaped deflector placed before {{the mouth of the}} chimney pipe, and a wire screen covering the wide stack exit. A more-efficient design was the Radley and Hunter centrifugal stack patented in 1850 (commonly known as the diamond stack), incorporating baffles so oriented as to induce a swirl effect in the chamber that encouraged the embers to burn out and fall to the bottom as ash. In the self-cleaning smokebox the opposite effect was achieved: by allowing the flue gasses to strike a series of <b>deflector</b> <b>plates,</b> angled {{in such a way that}} the blast was not impaired, the larger particles were broken into small pieces that would be ejected with the blast, rather than settle in the bottom of the smokebox to be removed by hand at the end of the run. As with the arrestor, a screen was incorporated to retain any large embers.|$|E
40|$|It is {{possible}} to produce concentrated free surface water jets by rapidly accelerating a geometrically shaped curved <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> below the free water surface. This principle has been established using a self focusing electromagnetic acoustic source (FEMAS) and this report verifies it using a shock tube based mechanical analogue of that system. The shape, form and speed o f the water jets produced vary between the two systems. Discrete pressure measurements using a needle hydrophone positioned at different points below the free water surface are presented. The variation in pressure amplitudes recorded highlight the scatter and uncertainty inherent in a complex coupled system, while the form o f the pressure trace is dependant on the mechanical design o f the system in use and the position o f the needle hydrophone in the pressure field. To better understand the experimental system, a computer simulation using commercially availa ble non-linear dynamic analysis software has been developed. This shows that the water surface jets result from the overall hydrodynamic, flow initiated by rapid movement o f the <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> below the water surface...|$|R

5000|$|Another of Kirtley's {{achievements}} in 1859 was, at last, {{to solve the}} problem of coal burning, by combining the brick arch with a firehole door <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> and a blower to increase the draught. Research into track wear was carried out by Robert Forester Mushet, who produced the first double-headed rail using Bessemer steel. Whereas wrought iron rails lasted typically six months, a length of steel rail laid near Derby station 1857 was still in use in 1873.|$|R
25|$|Magnification in a SEM can be {{controlled}} over a range of about 6 orders of magnitude from about 10 to 500,000 times. Unlike optical and transmission electron microscopes, image magnification in an SEM is not {{a function of the}} power of the objective lens. SEMs may have condenser and objective lenses, but their function is to focus the beam to a spot, and not to image the specimen. Provided the electron gun can generate a beam with sufficiently small diameter, an SEM could in principle work entirely without condenser or objective lenses, although it might not be very versatile or achieve very high resolution. In an SEM, as in scanning probe microscopy, magnification results from the ratio of the dimensions of the raster on the specimen and the raster on the display device. Assuming that the display screen has a fixed size, higher magnification results from reducing the size of the raster on the specimen, and vice versa. Magnification is therefore controlled by the current supplied to the x, y scanning coils, or the voltage supplied to the x, y <b>deflector</b> <b>plates,</b> and not by objective lens power.|$|E
500|$|A3s 2747 Coronach and [...] 2751 Humorist were {{subjected}} to smoke deflection trials following an accident [...] on the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) due to poor visibility; this included the modification of the upper smokebox area surrounding the chimney. Originally the whole smokebox wrapper was retained in order to form an air duct, with the exit behind the chimney, but this was found ineffective. The next stage, at least with 2751, was {{to cut off the}} top part of the wrapper, but retaining the sloping plate that directed air flow upwards, and therefore lifting the smoke above the locomotive. The original chimney was replaced by a double stove-pipe variety, and miniature <b>deflector</b> <b>plates</b> were added on either side, angled to concentrate the air flow when the locomotive was on the move.|$|E
500|$|As mentioned, {{the main}} {{production}} batch of Southern-built locomotives {{differed from the}} two prototypes, Channel Packet and Union Castle. [...] The steam-operated firehole door treadle was removed, and {{a new type of}} boiler cladding was utilised in response to the worsening supply situation during the Second World War. [...] Modification was also made to the air-smoothed casing surrounding the smokebox after reports were made of drifting smoke obscuring the locomotive crew's vision ahead. Initially, the only form of smoke deflection was a narrow slot in front of the chimney, intended to enable air to lift the smoke when the locomotive was travelling. This proved inadequate because of the relatively soft exhaust blast that came from the multiple-jet blastpipe, which failed to be caught by the air flow. [...] After several trials, the air flow was increased by extending the casing roof over the front of the smokebox to form a cowling whilst side smoke <b>deflector</b> <b>plates</b> were also incorporated into the front of the air-smoothed casing. The latter added to the poor visibility from the footplate and the expedients combined never fully solved the smoke drift problem.|$|E
40|$|Engine {{components}} are commonly {{exposed to air}} temperatures exceeding the thermal material limit {{in order to increase}} the overall engine performance and to maximise the engine specific fuel consumption. To prevent the overheating of the materials and thus the reduction of the component life, an internal flow system must be designed to cool the critical engine parts and to protect them. As the coolant flow is bled from the compressor and not used for the combustion an important goal is to minimise the amount of coolant in order to optimise the overall engine performance. Predicting the metal temperatures is of paramount importance as they are a major factor in determining the component stresses and lives. In addition, as modern engines operate in ever harsher conditions due to efficiency requirements, the ability to predict thermo-mechanical displacements becomes very relevant: on the one hand, to prevent damage of components due to excessive rubbing, on the other hand, to understand how much air is flowing internally within the secondary air system for cooling and sealing purposes, not only in the design condition but throughout the engine life-span. In order to achieve this aero-engine manufacturers aim to use more and more accurate numerical techniques requiring multi-physics models, including thermo-mechanical finite elements and CFD models, which can be coupled in order to investigate small variations in temperatures and displacements. This thesis shows a practical application and extension of a numerical methodology for predicting conjugate heat transfer. Extensive use is made of FEA (solids) and CFD (fluid) modeling techniques to understand the thermo-mechanical behaviour of a turbine stator well cavity, due to the interaction of cooling air supply with the main annulus. Previous work based on the same rig showed diffculties in matching predictions to thermocouple measurements near the rim seal gap. In this investigation, further use is made of existing measurements of hot running seal clearances in the rig. The structural deflections are applied to the existing model to evaluate the impact in flow interactions and heat transfer. Furthermore, for one test case unsteady CFD simulations are conducted in order {{to take into account the}} flow unsteadiness in the heat transfer predictions near the rim. In addition to a baseline test case without net ingestion, a case simulating engine deterioration with net ingestion is validated against the available test data, also taking into account cold and hot running seal clearances. Furthermore an additional geometry with a stationary <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> is modelled and validated for the same flow cases. Experiments as well as numerical simulations have shown that due to the <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> the cooling flow is fed more directly into the disc boundary layer, allowing more effective use of less cooling air, leading to improved engine efficiency. Therefore, the <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> geometry is embedded in a CFD-based automated optimisation loop to further reduce the amount of cooling air. The optimisation strategy concentrates on a flexible design parameterisation of the cavity geometry with <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> and its implementation in an automatic 3 D meshing system with respect of finally executing an automated design optimisation. Special consideration is given to the flexibility of the parameterisation method in order to reduce design variables to a minimum while also increasing the design space flexibility & generality. The parameterised geometry is optimised using a metamodel-assisted approach based on regressing Kriging in order to identify the optimum position and orientation of the <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> inside the cavity. The outcome of the optimisation is validated using the benchmarked FEA-CFD coupling methodology...|$|R
50|$|In the event, the {{experiment}} did not deliver the hoped-for benefits, and efficiency was not increased sufficiently {{to justify the}} cost and complexity. Moreover, conditions were unpleasant on the footplate in a cross-wind, this in spite the later provision of a small <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> forward of the chimney. These problems led to the subsequent sealing off of the preheater drum, over the period 1959-1961, and the locomotives were then worked conventionally. As a result of this, there was a reduced ability to generate steam, and so their power classification was reduced from 9F to 8F.|$|R

500|$|Rocket {{engineer}} G. Harry Stine worked alongside Coandă from 1961 to 1965 at Huyck Corporation, {{and interviewed}} him in 1962. In 1967, the magazine Flying printed an account written by Stine, which described {{the landing gear}} as retracting into the lower wing, with the fuel tank hidden in the upper wing. Stine wrote that Coandă flew on 10 December 1910, and described {{the heat from the}} [...] "two jet exhausts" [...] as being [...] "too much for me" [...] after the powerplant was mounted in the aircraft. In the 1980s after Coandă's death, Stine wrote a magazine article and a book mentioning the 1910 aircraft, including new details such as the name of master mechanic Pierre Clerget as the friend who helped build the turbo-propulseur.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation to}} explore {{the characteristics of the}} initial drop screen which was formed by sprinkler heads at low water pressures was carried out. Two commercially available sprinkler heads (with thin and massive frame arms) were modified, {{not only in terms of}} <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> design, but also with respect to the orifice diameter, in order to decrease the flow and study the effect on liquid sheet thickness, initial sheet angle, sheet breakup distance and drop size distributions and their correspondence with the existing mathematical models. It was found that the addition of a boss in the sprinkler design had little impact on the average drop size and sheet breakup distance. The presence of the boss was found to influence the initial angle of the liquid sheet, which was in line with findings of previous researches. Longer slots on the <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> did not change the initial angle of the sheet considerably, but did result in an earlier sheet breakup and smaller median drop diameter. A drop combustion sub-model was built, introducing two novel parameters: theoretical heat capacity (THC) and evaporate heat capacity (EHC), which could be used for estimating the actual heat capacity of the spray. In combination with the calculated drop size distribution in a spray screen, the combustion sub-model confirmed that sprinkler performance does not depend merely on provided flow, but rather on the drop size and the number of drops in a drop screen.
