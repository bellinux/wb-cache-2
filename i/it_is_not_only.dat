5|$|Blitzball {{is first}} {{introduced}} {{in the beginning of}} the game during one of the early cinematic sequences in which Tidus, the main character who is described as a star blitzball player, is part of an intense game. It is the only minigame that plays a role in the overall plot line as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> a main part of Tidus's character, but it's also in the first scene where the game's main antagonist, Sin is shown. Unlike with the other minigames, playing blitzball is mandatory near the beginning of the game, but it is later optional.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> males that are ousted from their pride to become nomads, {{although}} most females certainly do remain with their birth pride. However, when the pride becomes too large, {{the next generation}} of female cubs may be forced to leave to eke out their own territory. Furthermore, when a new male lion takes over the pride, adolescent lions, both male and female, may be evicted.|$|E
5|$|It seems {{curious that}} a text so {{obviously}} written {{with the expectation}} that it would be widely copied should exist in only one manuscript and that, apparently, a draft. Treharne has taken this as suggesting that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> modern readers who have found the work tedious (Treharne 2000, p.273). Orm, however, says in the preface that he wishes Walter to remove any wording that he finds clumsy or incorrect (quoted in Bennett and Smithers 1982, pp.175–76).|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> {{receptive}} {{fields that}} define the microzone structure: The climbing fiber input from the inferior olivary nucleus is equally important. The branches of a climbing fiber (usually numbering about 10) usually activate Purkinje cells belonging to the same microzone. Moreover, olivary neurons that send climbing fibers to the same microzone tend to be coupled by gap junctions, which synchronize their activity, causing Purkinje cells within a microzone to show correlated complex spike activity on a millisecond time scale. Also, the Purkinje cells belonging to a microzone all send their axons to the same small cluster of output cells within the deep cerebellar nuclei. Finally, the axons of basket cells are much longer in the longitudinal direction than in the mediolateral direction, causing them to be confined largely to a single microzone. The consequence of all this structure is that cellular interactions within a microzone are much stronger than interactions between different microzones.|$|E
5|$|The More Library is {{the main}} library for {{students}} whilst the 'House Libraries' (the Arundell, the Bay, and the Square) contain many artefacts from the Society of Jesus and English Catholicism. The Arundell Library, presented in 1837 by Everard, 11th Baron Arundell of Wardour, is the most significant; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> a country-house library from Wardour Castle but also has a notable collection of 250 incunabula, medieval manuscripts and volumes of Jacobite interest, signal among which is Mary Tudor's Book of Hours, which it is believed was given by Mary, Queen of Scots to her chaplain on the scaffold. The manuscript Le Livre de Seyntz Medicines was written in 1354 by Henry, Duke of Lancaster. To these were added {{the archives of the}} English Province of the Society of Jesus, which include 16th-century manuscript verses by St Robert Southwell SJ, the letters of St Edmund Campion SJ (1540–81) and holographs of the 19th-century poet Gerard Manley Hopkins. The Arundell Library has a copy of the Chronicles of Jean Froissart, captured at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, and held the 7th-century Stonyhurst Gospel of St John before it was loaned to the British Library, as well as a First Folio of Shakespeare.|$|E
