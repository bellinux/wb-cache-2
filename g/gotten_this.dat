25|$|However, another account {{states that}} after {{his brother was}} shot, Bonifacio was stabbed and hacked to death. This was {{allegedly}} done while he lay prone in a hammock {{in which he was}} carried to the site, being too weak to walk. This version was maintained by Guillermo Masangkay, who claimed to have <b>gotten</b> <b>this</b> information from one of Macapagal's men. Also, one account used to corroborate this version is of an alleged eyewitness, a farmer who claimed he saw five men hacking a man in a hammock. Historian Milagros Guerrero also says Bonifacio was bayoneted, and that the brothers were left unburied. After bones said to be Bonifacio's – including a fractured skull - were discovered in 1918, Masangkay claimed the forensic evidence supported his version of events. Writer Adrian Cristobal notes that accounts of Bonifacio's captivity and trial state he was very weak due to his wounds being left untreated; he thus doubts that Bonifacio was strong enough to make a last dash for freedom as Macapagal claimed. Historian Ambeth Ocampo, who doubts the Bonifacio bones were authentic, thus also doubts the possibility of Bonifacio's death by this manner.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{previous}} Sonic Youth albums, Washing Machine {{was recorded}} at Easley Studios in Memphis, where indie rock bands like Pavement, Guided by Voices and Grifters previously recorded albums. Moore remarked that {{the atmosphere in}} Memphis [...] "lent itself to avoiding {{the reality of the}} record-buying public. In the past we were always very aware of who was out there checking us out. This was the first record where we've <b>gotten</b> <b>this</b> certain level of notoriety and we were just, like, 'fuck it. He also felt that Washing Machine was conceived and recorded like some of the band's earlier albums: [...] "It hearkens back to records like Sister where we'd write a bunch of songs, go into the studio for a month, put them down, then go on the road and play them for a year. By {{the end of the year}} they'd mutate into something much more excited". Gordon credited Memphis for its relaxed atmosphere and cited the album as one of her favorites.|$|E

[...] After the 2001–2002 season, O'Neal told friends {{that he did not want}} another season of limping and being in virtually constant pain from his big right toe. His trademark mobility and explosion had been often absent. The corrective options ranged from reconstructive surgery on the toe to rehabilitation exercises with more shoe inserts and anti-inflammation medication. O'Neal was already wary of the long-term damage his frequent consumption of these medications might have. He did not want to rush a decision with his career potentially at risk.|$|E
