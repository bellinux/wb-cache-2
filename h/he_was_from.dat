5|$|Goffman {{was born}} 11 June 1922, in Mannville, Alberta, Canada, to Max Goffman and Anne Goffman, née Averbach. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>from</b> {{a family of}} Ukrainian Jews who had emigrated to Canada {{at the turn of}} the century. He had an older sibling, Frances Bay, who became an actress. The family moved to Dauphin, Manitoba, where his father {{operated}} a successful tailoring business.|$|E
5|$|Little {{has been}} {{recorded}} about Redheffer's life, other than his connection to the hoax. According to one source, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>from</b> Germantown in Philadelphia, but most sources simply state that he appeared in Philadelphia with his machine. Redheffer disappeared from public view after {{the discovery of the}} fraud, and his fate is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Yesterday, as my orderly {{was holding}} my horse, I asked him where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>from.</b> He said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>from</b> Hawaii! He {{proved to be}} a full-blood Kanaka, by the name of Kealoha, who came from the Islands last year. There is also another, by the name of Kaiwi, who lived near Judge Smith's, who left the Islands last July. I enjoyed seeing them very much and we had a good jabber in kanaka. Kealoha is a private in the 41st Regiment US Colored Troops, and Kaiwi is a Private in the 28th U.S.C.T., in the pioneer corps. Both are good men and seemed glad to have seen me.|$|E

5|$|Born in Exeter around 1125, Baldwin {{was the son}} of Hugh d'Eu, Archdeacon of Totnes, and a {{woman of}} unknown name who later became a nun. Gervase of Canterbury's story that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>from</b> an even humbler {{background}} has been shown by modern scholarship to stem from bias on the medieval chronicler's part. It is possible that he studied at Bologna in the 1150s with the future Pope Urban III. Robert Warelwast, who was Bishop of Exeter from 1138 to 1155, had sent Baldwin to Italy to study law. Baldwin was also said to have taught at Exeter, although this is not substantiated by any contemporary record. In 1150 or 1151 Pope Eugene III appointed him tutor to Eugene's nephew. By 1155 Baldwin seems to have returned to England, where he joined the household of Robert of Chichester, Bishop of Exeter.|$|E
5|$|Hensley {{told his}} {{children}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>from</b> West Virginia {{and that his}} family's roots were in Pennsylvania. In reality, his family lived in Hawkins County, Tennessee, in 1880, the year historian David Kimbrough argues Hensley was born. One of 13 children, Hensley lived in Tennessee in Hawkins County and Loudon County in the 1880s. His family lived in Big Stone Gap, Virginia, in the 1890s, and there he witnessed an elderly woman handle a snake during a revival service at a coal mining camp. His mother and sisters were very religious, and he was reared a Baptist.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Lao She {{introduced}} Xin Fengxia to {{the famous}} playwright Wu Zuguang. Like many intellectuals at the time, Wu held high hopes for the new People's Republic and returned to China from British Hong Kong. Xin, who had acted in one of Wu's plays, admired his talent. They married that year, {{despite the fact that}} they were from differing socioeconomic backgrounds; she had no formal education and was nearly illiterate, while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>from</b> a prominent family of scholars. Wu helped her to study reading, writing, and calligraphy. She also studied painting with Qi Baishi, one of the most celebrated masters of Chinese painting, who took her as his goddaughter.|$|E

5|$|Long {{was born}} in 1893 in {{southern}} Vietnam as Phan Phát Sanh. His place of birth is disputed; the historians R. B. Smith and Hue-Tam Ho Tai say that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>from</b> Cholon, the Chinese business district of Saigon, while Oscar Chapuis records Tan An as his place of birth. Sanh's father was a police officer. {{and it has been}} speculated that the family were of Chinese descent. He started as a servant in a French family, before travelling to the That Son (Seven Mountains) region in the far south of Vietnam, a region that was known as a hotbed of mysticism. There Long trained in mysticism. As a youth, Sanh travelled from Vietnam to Siam, earning his living as a fortune-teller and geomancer.|$|E
5|$|Some of the Kentish crowds now dispersed, {{but others}} continued. From this point, {{they appear to}} have been led by Wat Tyler, whom the Anonimalle Chronicle {{suggests}} was elected their leader at a large gathering at Maidstone on 7 June. Relatively little is known about Tyler's former life; chroniclers suggest that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>from</b> Essex, had served in France as an archer and was a charismatic and capable leader. Several chroniclers believe that he was responsible for shaping the political aims of the revolt. Some also mention a Jack Straw as a leader among the Kentish rebels during this phase in the revolt, but it is uncertain if this was a real person, or a pseudonym for Wat Tyler or John Wrawe.|$|E

5|$|Continuing their charge after McCausland's Brigade, the Union cavalry charged {{into the}} camp of the 16th Virginia Cavalry, which fled without resisting. Conger's 3rd West Virginia turned eastward and pursued rebels fleeing east {{down the road}} to Wardensville and Winchester. The 17th Virginia Cavalry was camped near some woods east of the main road, and had more time to prepare for the attack. They formed a battle line while three {{companies}} waited behind a fence. Initially, they repulsed Conger's men, forcing them to retreat. However, Conger was soon reinforced by Colonel Powell and the 1st West Virginia Cavalry, which was commanded by Colonel Henry Capehart. The two regiments charged the Virginians and drove them down the road or into the woods. During this time, Conger was killed by a lieutenant from the 17th Virginia. The Virginian was wearing a blue coat that fooled Conger into thinking <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>from</b> Conger's regiment. The two West Virginia regiments continued to pursue the Confederates down the road, and captured McCausland's two pieces of artillery. Eventually, some of the fleeing rebels ran into Major Work's 22nd Pennsylvania, and had to scatter to the woods. Work's men captured 34 of them.|$|E
5|$|Dodd, {{also known}} as Mullawa or Mulla walla (flying fish), was an Arunta or Arrente Indigenous man from central Australia. It is unclear if Dodd was from the Northern Territory or South Australia: one source states {{he was born in}} Alice Springs, and another states he was born at the Hermannsburg Mission, to the town's south-west. However a third source {{suggests}} Oodnadatta, across the border in South Australia, while Dodd himself, in a 2011 interview, stated he was South Australian. A 1953 newspaper report states that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>from</b> Coober Pedy and had been resident at Colebrook Home, which housed Indigenous children from northern South Australia; some residents subsequently identified as members of the Stolen Generation. The only record of a birth date is in the Department of Veterans' Affairs' Nominal Roll of Australian Veterans of the Korean War, which gives 1 June 1928.|$|E
5|$|In March 1981, {{widespread}} violence {{took place}} in Bangui following elections, after Operation Caban led the French to drop Bokassa (who had begun to call himself Emperor Bokassa I), and replaced him with David Dacko. Opponents of the President met in Bangui and were forced to flee the country. After returning voluntarily to Bangui {{in the autumn of}} 1986, Bokassa went on trial. Initially faced with the death penalty, in February 1988 he was instead sentenced to life imprisonment. His successor was General André Kolingba, army chief of staff of Decko’s army, who took over control from the local French military on 1 September 1981 under the pretext that the country was heading towards civil war. Although he attempted to combat corruption and control the national economy, he was unable to achieve his reforms. By the middle of the 1980s the country’s economic situation had deteriorated as 80% of the revenue went towards meeting the salaries of the staff. Under pressure from France and other western countries, Kolingba restored democracy in the country in 1991 with a multiparty government but elections could be held only three years later in August 1994. During the elections, Ange-Félix Patassé was elected to the post of president. Since <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>from</b> northern CAR, the southern group of Kolingba started a rebellion during 1996.|$|E

5|$|Most of what {{is known}} about John Endecott's origins is the result of {{research}} conducted since the 1990s. Biographers of the 19th century believed <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>from</b> the Dorset town of Dorchester because of his significant later association with people from that place. In the early 20th century, historian Roper Lethbridge proposed that Endecott was born circa 1588 in or near Chagford in Devon. Interestingly, in the 16th century the prominent Endecott family, together with the Whiddons, Knapmans and Lethbridges, owned most of the mines around the stannary town of Chagford, which might—if he is indeed from this family—explain the Governor's interest in developing copper mining. (Based on this evidence, Chagford now has a house from the period named in Endecott's honour.) However, more recent research by the New England Historic Genealogical Society has identified problems with Lethbridge's claims, which they dispute. Endecott has more recently been definitively determined to have been born in 1588 in Chagford, to Thomas Endecott and an unnamed mother, who died shortly after his birth.|$|E
5|$|The {{governmental}} {{structure of}} the newly formed Confederate States of America was very much {{like that of the}} parent United States. The executive branch was partitioned into several departments, each headed by a secretary or equivalent who would advise the president. The constitution provided for a navy that would be directed by its own department, and President Jefferson Davis nominated Mallory to be Confederate States Secretary of the Navy. He was chosen for two principal reasons: first, he had extensive experience with nautical affairs, both in his boyhood home of Key West and later in Washington; and second, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>from</b> Florida. In a bow to the principle of States' Rights, Davis had to spread representation in his cabinet around among the seceding states. Although the requirement of geographical representation sometimes meant that the occupant would not be the best person available, the selection process worked well in Mallory's case.|$|E
5|$|Urse {{came from}} an undistinguished family, {{and made his way}} on {{military}} reputation. He was probably born in about 1040, but the exact date is unknown. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>from</b> St Jean d'Abbetot in Normandy, where his family had lands, and where he himself was a tenant of the lords of Tancarville. Other tenants of the Tancarville lords included Robert d'Abetot and his wife Lesza, who held lands close to St Jean d'Abbetot in the early 12th century; despite the name, it is not certain that Robert d'Abetot was related to Urse. Urse had a brother usually called Robert Despenser, sometimes known as Robert fitz Thurstin, who also became a royal official. The historian Emma Mason suggested that Urse may have been a nickname rather than a forename, perhaps given on account of his tenacious temperament. Urse's usual last name derives from his ancestral village in Normandy. His brother's usual last name of Despenser derives from his office, that of dispenser, in the royal household.|$|E

5|$|With the {{surrender}} of Fort Henry, the Confederates faced some difficult choices. Grant's army now divided Confederate Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston's two main forces: P.G.T. Beauregard at Columbus, Kentucky, with 12,000 men, and William J. Hardee at Bowling Green, Kentucky, with 22,000 men. Fort Donelson had only about 5,000 men. Union forces might attack Columbus; they might attack Fort Donelson and thereby threaten Nashville, Tennessee; or Grant and Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell, who was quartered in Louisville with 45,000 men, might attack Johnston head-on, with Grant following behind Buell. Johnston was apprehensive about {{the ease with which}} Union gunboats defeated Fort Henry (not comprehending that the rising waters of the Tennessee River played a crucial role by inundating the fort). He was more concerned about the threat from Buell than <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>from</b> Grant, and suspected the river operations might simply be a diversion.|$|E
