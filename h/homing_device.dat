5|$|Homing on the enemy's {{broadcasts}} {{meant that}} there was no accurate way to calculate the range to the target; radar ranging measurements are based on timing the delay between broadcast and reception, {{and there was no way}} to know when the enemy's signal was originally broadcast. This meant that the <b>homing</b> <b>device</b> could only be used for the initial tracking, and the final approach would have to be carried out by radar. The extra range of the Mk. VIII was not required in this role as Serrate would bring the fighter within easy tracking range, and the loss of a Mk. IV would not reveal the secret of the magnetron to the Germans. For this reason, the Mk. IV was considered superior to the newer radars for this role, in spite of any technical advantages of the newer designs.|$|E

40|$|Bringing {{the vision}} that {{monoclonal}} antibodies (mAbs) could be medicinal “magic bullets” into practice {{has been a}} long and challenging journey which began in 1975 when Kohler and Milstein made it possible to generate these homogenous, highly specific <b>homing</b> <b>devices.</b> In the last 35 years, many hurdles have slowed the manifestation of this dream, including: target location; host species, specificity, and subclass of the mAb; immunogenicity of murine mAbs; mAb pharmacokinetics (i. e. hepatic and renal clearance); and mAb form (i. e. natural, conjugated to a toxin or radionuclide, humanized murine mAbs, scFvs). The work involved in overcoming these factors explains why few mAb's have been made it to the clinic in more than 3 decades later. Nonetheless, over 20 mAbs have been FDA-approved for human use since 1994.

2500|$|Chun-Li was {{a central}} {{character}} in the 1994 Street Fighter film, and was played by Ming-Na. She was given a surname ("Chun-Li Zang") and posed as a television reporter working in Shadaloo in her personal quest to track down and kill Bison, who had murdered her father during a peasant uprising. Her relationship with Guile is acrimonious from the start, as he bluntly rejects her interview request before seizing her microphone to exchange words with Bison on the air, then chides Chun-Li for his own inability to trace a signal broadcast by Bison. Chun-Li allies herself with E. Honda and Balrog, who work as her news crew and whose reputations were ruined by Bison's mafia connections, and later forms an initially uneasy alliance with Ryu and Ken working with Guile in attempting to locate Bison's secret fortress. After Guile's [...] "death" [...] during a staged prison break, Chun-Li uses a <b>homing</b> <b>device</b> to trace him to, and then infiltrate, the Allied Nations' headquarters, where she is shocked to discover that he is still alive. However, Guile refuses to brook her reasoning behind her actions, as {{he does not want}} her vendetta against Bison interfering with his own. He orders Cammy and T. Hawk to take Chun-Li into custody but she manages to escape. She, Balrog, and Honda, all posing as traveling carnival performers, later work with Ken and Ryu on an assassination attempt against Bison and Sagat with an explosives-filled truck, which detonates Bison's weapons caches instead, before they are all captured and taken to Bison's fortress. Chun-Li is held prisoner in Bison's private chambers (during which she is seen in an approximation to her traditional game costume, wearing a sleeveless red Chinese dress and with her hair made in ox horns, but not covered in brocades), and after she relays the story of her father's murder, Bison mocks her and her fighting skills in response, which provokes Chun-Li into attacking him, having planned all along for an opportunity to personally attack Bison. She actually gains the upper hand before becoming distracted by her comrades coming to her rescue, allowing Bison to escape before subduing them with knock-out gas. When Guile and the Allied Nations launch an invasion on Bison's fortress during the film's climax, she and Balrog help Ryu and Ken free Bison's hostages, and after Bison's forces are defeated, Guile promises her an exclusive interview, but only, he adds in jest, if she shows up in her costume.|$|E

40|$|Purpose of the study: {{characterization}} of the targeting potential of liposomes with multiple plasminogen molecules on the outside. Background: Liposomes can be loaded with a thrombolytic and on the outside multiple <b>homing</b> <b>devices</b> can be attached for site-specific delivery of the thrombolytic. We tested plasminogen {{as a candidate for}} multivalent interaction with the polymer fibrin in thrombi. Methods: An in vitro, closed loop, flow-through model system is used with a total volume of 600 μl and flow rate of 2 ml/min. After introduction of a clot, labelled plg-iiposomes (around 100 pig-molecules /liposomes) are administered and the accumulation of radio-label on the entire clot is measured. Results: plg-iiposomes show increased accumulation over free Pig, both on a fibrin clot and a whole blood clot, in buffer and in plasma. Most importantly, bound free pig can be washed away, while plgiiposomes cannot. Eventually, this results in strong binding of > 20 % of injected liposomes onto the thrombus. Binding is increased when fibrin is partially proteolysed. Plg-iiposomes are able to compete successfully with an excess of free pig and show a high clot accumulation rate: half maximal binding within 4 circulation times (1. 2 min). Conclusions: These in vitro findings indicate that plg-iiposomes may be suitable for rapid and effective in vivo targeting to thrombi. In vivo studies are performed at present with plg-iiposomes loaded with t-PA to verify this...|$|R

40|$|Background: Drug {{targeting}} to activated endothelial cells via E-selectin {{is currently}} being explored as {{a new approach to}} treat chronic inflammatory disorders. This approach uses E-selectin directed antibodies as carrier molecules to selectively deliver anti-inflammatory drugs into activated endothelial cells, thereby theoretically decreasing drug-associated side-effects. Therapeutic effects of developed drug targeting constructs will have to be tested in animal models of inflammation, in which E-selectin is expressed {{during the course of the}} disease. In this study several murine models of inflammation were investigated regarding expression of E-selectin. Methods: E-selectin expression was determined both at the mRNA level using RT-PCR and at the protein level by immunohistochemistry using two monoclonal antibodies (10 E 9. 6 and MES- 1). The models studied included delayed type hypersensitivity induced skin inflammation, dextran sodium sulphate induced colitis, kidney ischemia/reperfusion injury, atherosclerosis in ApoE knockout mice, and collagen induced arthritis. Results: In all animal models E-selectin mRNA expression was detected, although to a different extent. In contrast, only the delayed type hypersensitivity model and, to a minor extent, the collagen induced arthritis model showed E-selectin protein expression. Conclusions: These results stress the need to determine E-selectin protein expression and not only mRNA expression, when choosing an animal model for testing E-selectin directed drug targeting preparations. In addition, in the arthritis model, E-selectin protein detection was dependent on the particular anti-E-selectin antibody used. This finding may not only have implications for the development and/or choice of <b>homing</b> <b>devices</b> to be used in E-selectin directed drug targeting preparations, but also for inflammation research in general...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: A {{number of}} assays {{have so far}} been {{exploited}} for detection of cancer biomarkers in various malignancies. However, the expression of cancer biomarker(s) appears to be extremely low, therefore accurate detection demands sensitive optical imaging probes. While optical detection using conventional fluorophores often fail due to photobleaching problems, quantum dots (QDs) offer stable optical imaging in vitro and in vivo. Methods: In this review, we briefly overview the impacts of QDs in biology and its applications in bioimaging of malignancies. We will also delineate the existing obstacles for early detection of cancer and the intensifying use of QDs in advancement of diagnostic devices. Results: Of the QDs, unlike the II-VI type QDs (e. g., cadmium (Cd), selenium (Se) or tellurium (Te)) that possess inherent cytotoxicity, the I-III-VI 2 type QDs (e. g., AgInS 2, CuInS 2, ZnS-AgInS 2) appear to be less toxic bioimaging agents with better control of band-gap energies. As highly-sensitive bioimaging probes, advanced hybrid QDs (e. g., QD-QD, fluorochrome-QD conjugates used for sensing through fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), quenching, and barcoding techniques) have also been harnessed {{for the detection of}} biomarkers and the monitoring of delivery of drugs/genes to the target sites. Antibody-QD (Ab-QD) and aptamer-QD (Ap-QD) bioconjugates, once target the relevant biomarker, can provide highly stable photoluminescence (PL) at the target sites. In addition to their potential as nanobiosensors, the bioconjugates of QDs with <b>homing</b> <b>devices</b> have successfully been used for the development of smart nanosystems (NSs) providing targeted bioimaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT). Conclusion: Having possessed great deal of photonic characteristics, QDs can be used for development of seamless multifunctional nanomedicines, theranostics and nanobiosensors...|$|R

40|$|Hyperspectral imaging in the 2 - 5 µm {{band has}} {{implications}} for applications in detection and discrimination of objects of interest. Real time instrumentation is particularly powerful {{as a tool for}} characterization and field measurement. A compact, real-time, refractive MWIR hyperspectral imaging instrument has been designed and tested. The system has been designed for cryogenic operation to improve signal to noise ratio, reduce background noise, and enable real-time hyperspectral video processing. The system is a 2 - 5 µm 32 -band hyperspectral imager capable of collecting and processing complete hyperspectral image cubes at 15 cubesper-second. The ability to collect spectral imagery and process it at near video frame rates to find objects of interest based on spectral signatures is unique to this system. An alternate implementation yields higher spatial resolution and 64 spectral bands at a 2 cube-per-second frame rate. Real-time discrimination applications include finding and tracking varied gas plumes, industrial hygiene and process monitoring, and personnel tracking. REAL-TIME HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGING Real-time imaging over broad bands in the electromagnetic spectrum from ultraviolet (UV) through infrared (IR) has become a staple in the areas of remote sensing, surveillance, target detection and tracking, search and <b>homing</b> <b>devices,</b> spectrally tailored coating development, nondestructive inspection, and noninvasive diagnosis. Improvements are being made in these techniques all the time, with increased resolution, higher sensitivity, and greater information throughput being the benefit.

With the rest of the Decepticons scattered throughout Iacon, Megatron is left alone to fend off the Autobot siege against Trypticon. Megatron realizes that Trypticon will be destroyed, and salvages Trypticon's data core before Trypticon is destroyed. The Decepticon campaign ends with Megatron revealing that the salvaged data core contains the secrets of Dark Energon, and thus the Decepticons still have the advantage in the war.|$|R
5000|$|The wing {{provided}} {{support in}} March 1973 for Operation Homecoming, the repatriation of American prisoners from Hanoi, North Vietnam. In February 1973, the POWs, {{some of whom}} had been held since 1965, were finally released. Military Airlift Command (MAC) was given the honor of bringing the POWs home, but the MAC Lockheed C-141 Starlifter crews were upstaged by C-130 crewmen from the 374th. In preparation for the release, several C-130 flights transported members of the negotiating team into Hanoi. On the day of the release two C-130 crews flew into Gia Lam Airport with members of the release team and an Air Force combat control team who brought in <b>homing</b> <b>devices</b> to help the MAC crews find the airfield. When the prisoners were released, the two C-130 crews were standing with nothing to do. Seeing that the first prisoners were the most badly injured, SSgt Ron Zogoda, a loadmaster, too the initiative as he stepped forward and took the arm of the first prisoner to be released, then escorted him across more than 100 feet of tarmac to where the MAC [...] "freedom birds" [...] waited. (The MAC C-141 crews were under strict instructions not to leave their airplanes.) The other members of the two crews followed Zgoda's lead. When the POWs got to their first stop at Clark Air Base, Philippines, they told Gen. William Moore, commander of Thirteenth Air Force, how they appreciated the fact that the first Americans they talked too were combat crewmembers like themselves. Consequently, on subsequent releases, the C-130 crews were assigned escort duty with the returning prisoners.|$|R
