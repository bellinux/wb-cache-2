Age-standardised admission, and 30 - and 365 -day mortality ratios were estimated for cardiovascular disease and injury.

Methods Eligible reports were selected from a national organization and a specialist service using search terms relevant to adults with intellectual disability and/or mental ill health. Qualitative analysis was completed with comparison of themes identified in both sets of reports. Findings The numbers of choking incidents identified in national reports suggest underreporting compared with the specialist service and varying levels of severity. Themes included trends in timing, care setting and food textures as perceived by staff. Conclusions This study demonstrates paucity of detail in reporting in systems without additional question prompts.

40|$|Abstract In a {{national}} field experiment, the same questionnaires were administered simultaneously by RDD telephone interviewing, by the In-ternet with a probability sample, {{and by the}} Internet with a nonprobability sample of people who volunteered to do surveys for money. The probabil-ity samples were more representative of the nation than the nonprobability sample in terms of demographics and electoral participation, even after weighting. The nonprobability sample was biased toward being highly engaged in and knowledgeable about the survey’s topic (politics). The telephone data manifested more random measurement error, more survey satisficing, and more social desirability response bias than did the Inter-net data, and the probability Internet sample manifested more random error and satisficing than did the volunteer Internet sample.

Data quality assessment has become a hot topic in numerous sectors and considerable research has been carried out in this respect, although most of the existing frameworks often need to be adapted with respect to the use case needs and features. Within this context, this paper develops a methodology for assessing the quality of enterprises ’ daily maintenance reporting, relying both on an existing data quality framework and on a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique.

40|$|Research {{objective}} First, {{the aim of}} {{this pilot}} {{study was to examine the}} motives of European companies to practice integrated reporting applying The International Integrated Reporting Framework that has been introduced by The International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) in 2013. Second it aimed at revealing possible motive differentiations among certain industry sectors. However, in addition to a contribution to the investigation of motives for integrated reporting practice, the study made efforts to offer a contribution to investor relations as an academic discipline, which accounts for the least studied field in corporate communication. Methodology and theoretical foundations To illuminate possible motives and motive variations, thematic qualitative text analysis was chosen for examining 15 corporate annual reports within the financial services, utilities, consumer goods, and oil and gas sector. For approaching the phenomenon under study the theoretical foundations illustrated the importance of strategic communication, organizational legitimacy, the Nordic School approach for investor relations, and stakeholder engagement. Findings and conclusions The study found, the main drivers for engaging in integrated reporting to be (1) <b>enhanced</b> <b>reporting</b> efficiency, (2) improved trust and transparency, and (3) enabling the representation of a holistic business performance model. It revealed that the industry sectors applying this newly launched framework were differently motivated to engage in this reporting method. Whereas <b>enhanced</b> <b>reporting</b> efficiency was interpreted to be the main driver for the utilities industry, and the oil and gas sector, it was enhanced trust and transparency, and enabling to demonstrate long-term value creation that made the consumer goods practice integrated reporting. For the financial services sector the opportunity to report on a holistic business performance model was the main motive to apply integrated reporting. Thus, this study confirms what scholars have assumed earlier: motives to practice integrated reporting vary, not only by companies but also by respective industry sectors. The results indicate that business practitioners might choose to apply the framework above other reporting practices if, for instance, they aim at enhancing stakeholder engagement. Further, the findings seem to suggest that a one- size-fits-all solution for an framework is not an optimal solution in practice...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Taiwanese {{government}} offers {{firms that}} invest in qualified projects in emerging high-tech industries two mutually exclusive tax incentives—a corporate 5 -year tax exemption or shareholder investment tax credits. This study examines whether corporate managers take shareholder tax benefits into account in their corporate tax planning.

Listed firms with relatively high earnings response coefficients tend to choose a corporate 5 -year tax exemption, as it can <b>enhance</b> <b>reported</b> after-tax earnings. Further, in the 5 -year period following their choice of a particular tax incentive, firms choosing a corporate 5 -year tax exemption exhibit significantly lower earnings persistence than those choosing shareholder investment tax credits.
