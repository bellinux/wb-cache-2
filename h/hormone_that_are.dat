30|$|Peptides are {{involved}} in a variety of physiological and pathological processes, and play very important roles in modulating various cell functions such as the absorption of blood glucose into the body through the promotion of insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells by glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP 1), a peptide <b>hormone</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> postprandially secreted in intestinal L-cells and activates one of class B GPCRs, GLP 1 receptor (GLP 1 R) (Baggio and Drucker 2007). Because of their intermediate molecular size ranging from 0.5 to 5  kDa which is between that of small-molecule drugs and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, peptides potentially have advantages of easy drug design, high safety, accessibility for protein–protein interactions, targeting of intracellular molecules, and low production cost (Craik et al. 2013).|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} {{to the effects of}} thyroid <b>hormone</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> mediated through interaction with chromatin-associated receptors, T 4 modulates the activity of the cellular content of the membrane-associated protein type II iodothyronine 52 ̆ 7 -deiodinase (52 ̆ 7 D-II) by regulating its degradation through an actin-dependent extranuclear mechanism. Under the influence of thyroid hormone, the substrate-binding subunit of 52 ̆ 7 D-II is translocated from the plasma membrane to an intracellular microfilament-associated pool. In glial cells, a 55 -kilodalton (kDa) protein (glial-p 55), which was shown to be identical to the 55 -kDa monomer of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) also demonstrates a similar T 4 -dependent association to the F-actin microfilaments. To explore the role of glial-p 55 in the extranuclear effect of thyroid hormone in glial cells, the effects of thyroid hormone on the subcellular localization of glial-p 55 were further examined. The current study demonstrates the presence of two pools of glial-p 55. While the majority of glial-p 55 is associated with endoplasmic reticulum and represents PDI, approximately 25...|$|E
40|$|Genomic {{actions of}} thyroid hormone are {{initiated}} with intranuclear binding of the hormone by heterodimeric nuclear thyroid hormone receptor (TR) proteins that are transcription factors. There is increasing recent experimental {{appreciation of the}} existence of nongenomic actions of the <b>hormone</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> initiated in cytoplasm or at the plasma membrane. Those that begin in cytoplasm may involve nuclear TRs now recognized to reside in cytoplasm and may alter the state of the actin cytoskeleton or foster insertion into the plasma membrane of the Na,K-ATPase; cytoplasmic action of the hormone via TR may also culminate downstream in the nucleus in the transcription of specific genes, such as hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 α. A plasma membrane receptor for L-thyroxine (T 4) and 3, 5, 3 ’-triiodo-L-thyronine (T 3) has been described on integrin αvβ 3. Among the complex mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; ERK 1 / 2) -mediated activities initiated at the integrin receptor are tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Shuttling of TRs between cytoplasm and nucleus may be promoted by thyroid hormone via the integrin. The hormonal actions attributable to integrin-liganded T 4 or T 3 can be reproduced by hormone analogues tethered to agarose or to nanoparticles that prevent cell entry of the hormone.
