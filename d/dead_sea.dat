5|$|At present, {{there are}} two ways to get to Arad: by air or road. The only highway {{connecting}} Arad with the rest of the country is Highway 31, which connects it with Beersheba to the west, and the <b>Dead</b> <b>Sea</b> to the east. It has two junctions within Arad's municipal area—the Arad Junction (within the city itself, with Road 3199), and the Tel Arad Junction (with Highway 80). The local Road 3199 connects Arad with Masada, but does not connect to the road next to the <b>dead</b> <b>sea</b> (Highway 90). It is therefore the only way to get to Masada's western side.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Dead</b> <b>Sea</b> is {{receding}} at {{an alarming}} rate. Multiple canals and pipelines were proposed to reduce its recession, which had begun causing many problems. The Red Sea–Dead Sea Water Conveyance project, carried out by Jordan, will provide water to neighbouring countries, while the brine will be carried to the <b>Dead</b> <b>Sea</b> to help stabilise its levels. The {{first phase of the}} project is scheduled to begin in 2018 and to be completed in 2021. Phosphate mines in the south have made Jordan one of the largest producers and exporters of this mineral in the world.|$|E

In Israel it grows in the Judean desert, the <b>Dead</b> <b>Sea</b> Valley, the Negev hills and Eilat.|$|E

The term 'Biblical Hebrew' may or may not include extra-biblical texts, such as inscriptions (e.g. the Siloam inscription), and generally also includes later vocalization traditions for the Hebrew Bible's consonantal text, most commonly the early medieval Tiberian vocalization.|$|E

40|$|The {{hydrological}} model TRAIN {{was successfully}} applied {{to reproduce the}} water conditions of the Jordan and <b>Dead</b> <b>Seas</b> catchments and their surrounding area. For the first time, a detailed overview of current water availability has been compiled for the Middle East. Data from three climate model combinations were fed to TRAIN to generate potential future water scenarios. Results showed that a clear precipitation decrease can be expected in the coming decades. A decrease in rainfall leads to significant reductions in water availability and reduces total river runoff while irrigation water demand increases. Climate change appears to dominate over land-use change impacts on water resources. There is, however, a potential to reduce adverse climatic effects by appropriate land-use planning...|$|R
5|$|According to Tchernov's 1962 paper, Passer predomesticus {{was found}} in the middle Acheulean (middle Pleistocene, {{probably}} more than 400,000 years old) layer E1 of the Oumm-Qatafa cave in Wadi Khareitoun near Bethlehem. In 1984, however, Tchernov wrote that P.predomesticus was about 140,000 years old, from the Yabrudian. Layer E1 contained remains of about 40bird species, including a premaxilla Tchernov described as a precursor of the <b>Dead</b> <b>Sea</b> sparrow (Passer moabiticus) and a tarsometatarsus and humerus tentatively allied with the house sparrow. An undetermined Acheulean layer of the same cave also contained fossils Tchernov described as precursors of both the house and Spanish sparrows.|$|E
5|$|Bromine is {{significantly}} less {{abundant in the}} crust than fluorine or chlorine, comprising only 2.5parts per million of the Earth's crustal rocks, and then only as bromide salts. It is the forty-sixth most abundant element in Earth's crust. It {{is significantly}} more abundant in the oceans, resulting from long-term leaching. There, it makes up 65parts per million, corresponding to a ratio of about one bromine atom for every 660 chlorine atoms. Salt lakes and brine wells may have higher bromine concentrations: for example, the <b>Dead</b> <b>Sea</b> contains 0.4% bromide ions. It is from these sources that bromine extraction is mostly economically feasible.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is too {{reactive}} {{to occur}} as the free element in nature but is very {{abundant in the}} form of its chloride salts. It is the twentieth most abundant element in Earth's crust and makes up 126parts per million of it, through the large deposits of chloride minerals, especially sodium chloride, that have been evaporated from water bodies. All of these pale in comparison to the reserves of chloride ions in seawater: smaller amounts at higher concentrations occur in some inland seas and underground brine wells, such as the Great Salt Lake in Utah and the <b>Dead</b> <b>Sea</b> in Israel.|$|E

5000|$|Brogan {{performs}} his own {{material as}} a guitarist and vocalist in Sea Pinks and frequently enlisted Cully and Miskimmin on bass and drums respectively, for live shows between 2010 and 2012. Since late 2012, {{the members of}} Charles Hurts have played as Brogan's backing band. Sea Pinks has released five albums (Youth Is Wasted in September 2010, <b>Dead</b> <b>Seas</b> in September 2011, Freak Waves in September 2012, Dreaming Tracks in September 2014 and Soft Days in January 2016). Brogan describes Sea Pinks' style as having [...] "substituted Girls Names' shades of grey for a sunnier disposition and more stripped-down sound". He also runs the Belfast-based indie label CF Records (formerly known as Cass/Flick and Caff/Flick), which put out the first Girls Names releases as well as recordings by Cloud Nothings, Mount Eerie, High Places, Lucky Dragons, Thread Pulls, No Monster Club and Patrick Kelleher.|$|R
