50|$|The Mk XX mine became {{available}} in early 1941 with a copper wire antenna extended 60 ft above the <b>explosive</b> <b>casing</b> by a buoyant float {{and a lower}} antenna extending 74 ft below the casing. Minelaying progressed with new fields laid {{north and south of}} the Faeroes and in the Denmark Strait using Mk XX mines wherever its 134 ft depth coverage would reduce the number of mines required. Additional safety measures were required for the new mines after Menestheus was damaged by detonation of a drifting Mk XX mine on 6 February 1941. Intelligence reports in July indicated that U-boats were using the Faeroes-Iceland passage, so a series of deep anti-submarine fields were laid north-west of the Faeroes. A refitting programme in U.S. ports was implemented in 1941, but work was delayed by fog and gales.|$|E
40|$|Fragments of {{aluminium}} impacting on Composition B explosives encased in rolled homogenous armour (RHA) steel were investigated using the explicit nonlinear finite element method. The investigation focused on shock to detonation simulations of Composition B, {{with the objective}} of determining the critical velocity which would generate a shock wave strong enough to cause detonation of the explosive and the resulting pressure profile of the detonation wave. Detonation scenarios at low, intermediate, high impact velocity were investigated. It was observed that a) at intermediate velocities detonation was due to the development of localized hot spots caused by the compression of the explosive from the initial shockwave; b) at high impact velocity, initiation of the explosive was caused by the initial incident wave behind the top casing/explosive interface. c) At low impact velocity, initiation of the explosive may be caused by the increased pressure of reflecting waves against the surfaces of the <b>explosive</b> <b>casing.</b> This case served to show the importance of capturing all confining surfaces correctly as any surface enhance detonation. Advanced features of the simulation includes Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) approach, the Elastic Plastic Hydrodynamic constitutive material model and the Ignition and Growth of Reaction in High Explosive eq uation of state (IGRHE-EOS) to account for the probability that the explosive may not detonate when impacted.

50|$|Upon {{detonation}} of the <b>explosive,</b> the <b>casing</b> disintegrates into {{extremely small}} particles, {{as opposed to}} larger pieces of shrapnel which results from the fragmentation of a metal shell casing. The HMTA powder acts like micro-shrapnel which is very lethal at close range (about 4 meters or 13 feet), but loses momentum very quickly due to air resistance, coming to a halt within approximately 40 times {{the diameter of the}} charge. This increases the probability of killing people within a few meters of the explosion while reducing the probability of causing death and injuries or damage farther away. Survivors close to the lethal zone may still have their limbs amputated by the HMTA microshrapnel, which can slice through soft tissue and bone.|$|R
5000|$|The W53 warhead of the B53 used oralloy (highly enriched uranium) {{instead of}} {{plutonium}} for fission, {{with a mix}} of lithium-6 deuteride fuel for fusion. The explosive lens comprised a mixture of RDX and TNT, which was not insensitive. Two variants were made: the B53-Y1, a [...] "dirty" [...] weapon using a U-238-encased secondary, and the B53-Y2 [...] "clean" [...] version with a non-fissile (lead or tungsten) secondary <b>casing.</b> <b>Explosive</b> yield was approximately nine megatons.|$|R
5000|$|A high {{explosive}} bomb {{is one that}} employs a process called [...] "detonation" [...] to rapidly go from an initially high energy molecule to a very low energy molecule. Detonation is distinct from deflagration in that the chemical reaction propagates faster {{than the speed of}} sound (often many times faster) in an intense shock wave. Therefore, the pressure wave produced by a {{high explosive}} is not significantly increased by confinement as detonation occurs so quickly that the resulting plasma does not expand much before all the explosive material has reacted. This has {{led to the development of}} plastic <b>explosive.</b> A <b>casing</b> is still employed in some high explosive bombs, but with the purpose of fragmentation. Most high explosive bombs consist of an insensitive secondary explosive that must be detonated with a blasting cap containing a more sensitive primary explosive.|$|R
5|$|Following the Palomares and Thule accidents—the only {{cases where}} the {{conventional}} explosives of U.S. nuclear bombs accidentally detonated and dispersed nuclear materials—investigators concluded the high explosive (HE) used in nuclear weapons was not chemically stable enough to withstand the forces involved in an aircraft accident. They also determined that the electrical circuits of the weapons' safety devices became unreliable in a fire and allowed connections to short circuit. The findings triggered research by scientists in the United States into safer conventional <b>explosives</b> and fireproof <b>casings</b> for nuclear weapons.|$|R
50|$|Three {{approaches}} are taken when designing insensitive munitions: Firstly, the high energy device can be protected and transported with an external protection of some kind. Some munition shipping containers {{are designed to}} provide some protection and thermal insulation. Secondly, the chemistry of the high energy fill is chosen to provide {{a higher degree of}} stability, for example by using plastic bonded <b>explosives.</b> Lastly, the <b>casings</b> of high energy devices can be designed {{in such a way as}} to allow venting or some other form of pressure relief in a fire.|$|R
40|$|Many {{different}} casing formulae {{have been}} proposed to determine the airblast-effective equivalent weight from the actual weight of HE in cased charges. Equivalent weight {{is needed to determine}} blastparameters as peak overpressure or specific blastimpulse from available standard curves for bare <b>explosives.</b> As different <b>casing</b> formulae result in very different equivalent weight, it was necessary to check them by new tests. It was found that semiempirical casing formulae are not more useful than simple linear approximation formulae. There is no theoretical approach that allows to determine the equivalent mass correctly. Casing formulae are proposed here that possibly enable a new theoretical approach...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{two-dimensional}} problem involving fluid-solid coupling where a solution {{is given in}} closed form. The upper half of the domain is modeled as an isotropic solid; the lower part as a compressible gas. The loading of the solid at the fluid-solid boundary is called superseismic when its speed {{is larger than the}} speed of propagation of disturbances in the bulk of the material. The loading is modeled by a shock coupled to the deformation of the boundary. The problem is relevant to high explosive applications, since it is very similar to the interaction between an <b>explosive</b> and the <b>casing</b> in a cylinder test experiment. Within this framework, we show the existence of self-similar solutions in the reference frame moving with the shock wave...|$|R
40|$|An {{equation}} {{to predict}} blast effects from cased charges was first proposed by U. Fano in 1944 and revised by E. M. Fisher in 1953 [1]. Fisher’s revision provides much better matches to available blast impulse data, but still requires empirical parameter adjustments. A new derivation [2], {{based on the}} work of R. W. Gurney [3] and G. I. Taylor [4], has resulted in an equation which nearly matches experimental data. This new analytical model is also capable of being extended, through the incorporation of additional physics, such as the effects of early case fracture, finite casing thickness, casing metal strain energy dissipation, explosive gas escape through casing fractures and the comparative dynamics of blast wave and metal fragment impacts. This paper will focus on the choice of relevant case fracture strain criterion, as it will be shown that this allows the explicit inclusion of the dynamic properties of the <b>explosive</b> and <b>casing</b> metal. It will include a review and critique of the most significant earlier work on this topic, contained in a paper by Hoggatt and Recht [5]. Using this extended analytical model, good matches can readily be made to available free-field blast impulse data, without any empirical adjustments being needed. Further work will be required to apply this model to aluminised and other highly oxygen-deficient explosives...|$|R
40|$|Research is {{reported}} concerning an aqueous process for oxidative destruction of solid- and liquid organic wastes, including ongoing work relevant to demilitarization This process uses acidified ammonium- or sodium peroxydisulfate and operates at ambient pressure and at temperatures of 80 - 100 C The oxidant may be regenerated by electrolysis of the sulfate by- product at Pt anodes at roughly 80 % coulombic efficiency, {{even in the}} presence of inorganic contaminants (e g, nitrate, phosphate or chloride) found in the original waste and entrained in the recycle stream Integral rate constants have been determined for the oxidation of diverse organic compounds at low concentrations (50 ppm, C), with rate constants (based on equivalents) of 0 004 -O 02 miri Higher concentrations generally react at a 2 - 4 X higher rate. The process has been carried through full- scale laboratory tests and initial pilot plant tests on chlorinated solvents, using a hydrolysis pretreatment Integral rate data indicate throughput rates of about 200 kg- C/m 3 -day The process may benefit the demilitarization efforts in various specialized applications destruction of solvents; destruction of trace propellants and <b>explosives</b> in shell <b>casings</b> remaining after bulk removal, destruction of red and pink waters, in situ remediation of soils at open pit burning/detonation sites; and as a regenerative filter for offgas carrying toxic or explosive substances...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} the Eco Logic Process and discusses the procedures and {{results of a}} pilot-scale treatability study on <b>explosives</b> in shell <b>casings.</b> The study was conducted {{as part of a}} contract which was awarded to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) and Eco Logic by the Department of Energy's Federal Energy Technology Center (FETC) in Morgantown, West Virginia to conduct treatability studies on complex hazardous wastes, energetic and low level mixed wastes. The U. S. Army currently decontaminates spent shell casings using a bailout or high pressure wash process that removes a large amount of the propellant from the casing but not enough to allow recycle of the entire casing intact; the U. S. Army currently projects the use of a metal parts furnace to completely decontaminate the shell casings. Use of the Eco Logic Process to decontaminate the shell casings would allow the shell casing to be reused intact. In addition to explosives commonly used by the Army such as TNT and Composition B, ARDEC personnel also were interested in the decontamination of shell casings with a residual of the propellant Yellow D which is a common energetic in artillery shell casings used by the Navy. A series of treatability tests on neat samples of explosive as well as shell <b>casings</b> containing each <b>explosive</b> were performed between June 9 and June 20, 1997 at the US Army's Edgewood Research Development, Engineering Center (ERDEC) toxic test chamber facility located at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland., including a 2 gram neat sample of TNT and lO gram samples of TNT, composition B and Yellow D to determine optimal treatment conditions for each explosive followed by two tests on washed shell casings containing trace amounts of TNT and a total of six tests, two each on shell casings lined with 10 grams of TNT, composition B and Yellow D...|$|R
