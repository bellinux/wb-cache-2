5|$|At {{present the}} most <b>informative</b> {{sequence}} of dinosaur-bearing {{rocks in the}} world from the K–Pg boundary is found in western North America, particularly the late Maastrichtian-age Hell Creek Formation of Montana. This formation, when compared with the older (approximately 75Ma) Judith River/Dinosaur Park Formations (from Montana and Alberta respectively) provides information on the changes in dinosaur populations over the last 10million years of the Cretaceous. These fossil beds are geographically limited, covering only part of one continent.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, the adventurers' ship lands in New Phlan, and they receive a brief but <b>informative</b> tour of the civilized area. They learn that the city is plagued with a history of invasions and wars and has been {{overtaken}} by a huge band of humanoids and other creatures. Characters hear rumors that a single controlling element is in charge of these forces. The characters begin a block-by-block quest to rid the ruins of monsters and evil spirits.|$|E
5|$|Most {{multiple}} sequence alignment methods try {{to minimize}} the number of insertions/deletions (gaps) and, as a consequence, produce compact alignments. This causes several problems if the sequences to be aligned contain non-homologous regions, if gaps are <b>informative</b> in a phylogeny analysis. These problems are common in newly produced sequences that are poorly annotated and may contain frame-shifts, wrong domains or non-homologous spliced exons.|$|E
5|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{has good}} spatial resolution (~0.5 micrometers) and sensitivity (single nanotubes); it requires only minimal sample preparation and is rather <b>informative.</b> Consequently, Raman spectroscopy {{is probably the}} most popular technique of carbon nanotube characterization. Raman scattering in SWCNTs is resonant, i.e., only those tubes are probed which have one of the bandgaps equal to the exciting laser energy. Several scattering modes dominate the SWCNT spectrum, as discussed below.|$|E
5|$|The FIC {{includes}} information guides on the fortifications of Malta, {{going back}} to the first fortifications at Borġ in-Nadur and focusing especially on those built by the Order and the British. It contains models of Maltese forts, as well as <b>informative</b> panels describing fortifications around the world, thus putting Malta's fortifications in context.|$|E
5|$|The family symbol in {{advertising}} may be observable before the industrial revolution, {{but it was}} not until after the industrial revolution that advertising boomed and the use of family images {{in advertising}} became prevalent. The industrial revolution changed advertising from <b>informative</b> flyers marking the availability of goods in 17th and 18th century Europe, whose audience were those within physical propinquity, to multimillion-dollar campaigns that attempted to instantly connect and persuade peoples from across the world. After the industrial revolution, large companies emerged as mass-producers, products became branded, and customers began establishing brand loyalties. Thus, persuading customers to purchase one brand rather than another became vital to advertising. An advertisement was responsible for making products and services salient in order to earn consumer attention in competitive industrial markets. During this period, not only did the immensity of the advertising industry drastically change, but so did its marketing strategies as it began to incorporate images and specify an audience. This change from largely <b>informative</b> to largely persuasive strategies and from general to specific audiences explains the increase in presence and usage of symbols, representations, and stereotypes in advertising—including those of the family.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, the {{national}} flag is reserved to serve either <b>informative</b> of festive purposes. A single specimen {{of the flag}} on or {{in front of a}} public office building indicates its official role. Multiple flags, on the other hand, are normally used to decorate both public and private buildings to mark special occasions, such as national holidays.|$|E
5|$|Although {{probable}} {{prokaryotic cell}} fossils date to almost 3.5billion years ago, most prokaryotes {{do not have}} distinctive morphologies and fossil shapes cannot {{be used to identify}} them as archaea. Instead, chemical fossils of unique lipids are more <b>informative</b> because such compounds do not occur in other organisms. Some publications suggest that archaeal or eukaryotic lipid remains are present in shales dating from 2.7billion years ago; such data have since been questioned. Such lipids have also been detected in even older rocks from west Greenland. The oldest such traces come from the Isua district, which include Earth's oldest known sediments, formed 3.8billion years ago. The archaeal lineage may be the most ancient that exists on Earth.|$|E
5|$|As more carcharodontosaurids were discovered, their interrelationships became clearer. The {{group was}} defined as all allosauroids closer to Carcharodontosaurus than Allosaurus or Sinraptor by Thomas R. Holtz and colleagues in 2004. In 2006, Coria and Currie united Giganotosaurus and Mapusaurus in the carcharodontosaurid {{subfamily}} Giganotosaurinae based on shared features of the femur, such as a weak fourth trocanther, and a shallow, broad groove on the lower end. In 2008, Sereno and Stephen L. Brusatte united Giganotosaurus, Mapusaurus, and Tyrannotitan in the tribe Giganotosaurini. Giganotosaurus {{is one of the}} most complete and <b>informative</b> members of Carcharodontosauridae.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{chemical}} antioxidants, cells are protected against oxidative stress by an interacting network of antioxidant enzymes. Here, the superoxide released by {{processes such as}} oxidative phosphorylation is first converted to hydrogen peroxide and then further reduced to give water. This detoxification pathway {{is the result of}} multiple enzymes, with superoxide dismutases catalysing the first step and then catalases and various peroxidases removing hydrogen peroxide. As with antioxidant metabolites, the contributions of these enzymes to antioxidant defenses can be hard to separate from one another, but the generation of transgenic mice lacking just one antioxidant enzyme can be <b>informative.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bache's {{strategy}} for presenting these works {{was one of}} familiarity. He performed two-piano arrangements of Liszt's orchestral works prior to the debuts of the original versions, and performed some of Liszt's symphonic poems shortly after they had been premiered at the Crystal Palace. He also provided <b>informative,</b> scholarly program notes, written by leading musical analysts and intimates in the Liszt circle. The English musical press, while generally hostile to the music he presented, noted and appreciated Bache's efforts. Liszt remained grateful; without Bache, he acknowledged, his music might not have gained the foothold that it did.|$|E
5|$|Born in Lawton, Oklahoma {{and raised}} in Anaheim, California, Hillenburg became fascinated with the ocean {{as a child and}} also {{developed}} an interest in art. He started his professional career in 1984, instructing marine biology, at the Orange County Marine Institute, where he wrote The Intertidal Zone, an <b>informative</b> comic book about tide-pool animals, which he used to educate his students. In 1989, two years after leaving teaching, Hillenburg enrolled at the California Institute of the Arts to pursue a career in animation. He was later offered a job on the Nickelodeon animated television series Rocko's Modern Life (19931996) after his success with short films The Green Beret and Wormholes (both 1992), which he made while studying animation.|$|E
5|$|Critics chastised Stewart for not {{conducting}} sufficiently hard-hitting {{interviews with}} his political guests, {{some of whom}} he may have lampooned in previous segments. Stewart and other Daily Show writers responded to such criticism by saying {{that they do not}} have any journalistic responsibility and that as comedians their only duty is to provide entertainment. Stewart's appearance on the CNN show Crossfire picked up this debate, where he chastised the CNN production and hosts for not conducting <b>informative</b> and current interviews on a news network.|$|E
5|$|Lutheran theologian Rudolf Bultmann {{proposed}} that the Bible contains existential content which is expressed through mythology; Bultmann sought to find the existential truths behind the veil of mythology, a task known as 'demythologising'. Bultmann distinguished between <b>informative</b> language and language with personal import, the latter of which commands obedience. He believed that God interacts with humans as the divine Word, perceiving a linguistic character inherent in God, which seeks to provide humans with self-understanding. Bultmann believed that the cultural embeddedness of the Bible could be overcome by demythologising the Bible, a process which he believed would allow readers to better encounter the word of God.|$|E
5|$|The Allied command {{structure}} in the South West Pacific Area faced the challenges of coalition warfare in several ways, {{with varying degrees of}} success. The benefits of the wartime alliances proved to be substantial, but required constant effort to maintain. For Australia and New Zealand, coalition warfare became the norm, and the experience in SWPA proved to be a formative and <b>informative</b> one, with many political and military lessons. Over the following decades, Australian, New Zealand and American forces would fight together again, in the Korean War, Vietnam War and the War on Terror.|$|E
25|$|Studying model {{organism}}s can be <b>informative,</b> but {{care must be}} taken when extrapolating from one organism to another.|$|E

25|$|Lieutenant-interpreter (later Commander) Robert Aspinion (…?–...?) is {{the author}} of Apprenons le berbère: {{initiation}} aux dialectes chleuhs (1953), an <b>informative</b> though somewhat disorganized teaching grammar. Aspinion's simple but accurate transcriptions did away with earlier phonetic and French-based systems.|$|E
25|$|Mass {{spectrometry}} is a {{very sensitive}} and reliable analytical method to detect DNA methylation. MS in general is however not <b>informative</b> about the sequence context of the methylation, thus limited in studying the function of this DNA modification.|$|E

25|$|As {{elaborated}} below, it {{is typically}} impossible, outside the exponential family of distributions, {{to identify a}} finite-dimensional set of sufficient statistics. Nevertheless, <b>informative,</b> but possibly non-sufficient, summary statistics are often used in applications where inference is performed with ABC methods.|$|E
25|$|Baden-Powell made {{paintings}} and drawings almost every day of his life. Most have a humorous or <b>informative</b> character. He published books and other texts during his years of military service both to finance his life and to educate his men.|$|E
25|$|The prose of {{the century}} is mainly {{dedicated}} to scientific subjects, but the letters of António da Costa, António Ribeiro Sanches, and Alexandre de Gusmão have literary value {{and those of the}} celebrated Carvalheiro d'Oliveira, if not so correct, are even more <b>informative.</b>|$|E
25|$|Trail {{is often}} cited as an {{important}} determinant of bicycle handling characteristics, and is sometimes listed in bicycle manufacturers' geometry data, although Wilson and Papodopoulos argue that mechanical trail {{may be a more}} important and <b>informative</b> variable, although they both describe very nearly the same thing.|$|E
25|$|The {{causes of}} martyrs were {{conducted}} {{in the same way}} as those of confessors as far as the <b>informative</b> processes and those de non cultu and ad introductionem causae were concerned. But when once the commission of introduction had been appointed they advance much more rapidly.|$|E
25|$|The {{inclusion}} of fish vertebrae, jaw bones, teeth, and other <b>informative</b> skeletal elements improves prey identification and quantification over otolith analysis alone. This {{is especially true}} for fish species with fragile otoliths, but other distinctive bones, such as Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), and Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus).|$|E
25|$|Though genealogical DNA {{test results}} in general have no <b>informative</b> medical value {{and are not}} {{intended}} to determine genetic diseases or disorders, a correlation exists between a lack of DYS464 markers and infertility, and between mtDNA haplogroup H and protection from sepsis. Certain haplogroups {{have been linked to}} longevity.|$|E
