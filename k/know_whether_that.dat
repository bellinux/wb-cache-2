2500|$|Cameron {{described}} himself in December 2005 as a [...] "modern compassionate conservative" [...] and {{spoke of a}} need for a new style of politics, saying that he was [...] "fed up with the Punch and Judy politics of Westminster". He was [...] "certainly a big Thatcher fan, but I don't <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>that</b> makes me a Thatcherite", claiming to be a [...] "liberal Conservative", though [...] "not a deeply ideological person." [...] As Leader of the Opposition, Cameron asserted that he did not intend to oppose the government as a matter of course, and would offer his support in areas of agreement. He has urged politicians to concentrate more on improving people's happiness and [...] "general well-being", instead of focusing solely on [...] "financial wealth". There were claims that he {{described himself}} to journalists at a dinner during the leadership contest as the [...] "heir to Blair".|$|E
2500|$|In June 2007, Perverted-Justice {{was criticized}} {{following}} a sting operation in Collin County, Texas {{that resulted in}} the charges against 23 suspected online sex predators being dropped. Collin County Assistant District Attorney Greg Davis said the cases were dropped after Perverted-Justice failed to provide enough usable evidence. [...] "In many cases, we could not prosecute because Perverted Justice refused to answer our questions, refused to participate as witnesses, or refused to turn over potential evidence." [...] Susan Etheridge, director of the Children's Advocacy Center in Plano, Texas, was not surprised the cases were thrown out. She doubts the efficacy of a citizen-based group in conducting such a sting, [...] "I know that law enforcement works very hard to find and prosecute Internet predators. When citizens do it -- I don't <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>that</b> can work. Perhaps policing is best left to the police." [...] Responding to the criticism, members of Perverted-Justice have stated on their website that they were never asked for the relevant evidence, never refused to provide witnesses, and answered all the Murphy Prosecutor's questions. They describe the Collin County District Attorney's Office as [...] "corrupt", [...] "inept", and [...] "incompetent", while labeling Collin County, Texas DA Greg Davis [...] "the biggest liar we've ever dealt with in our lives." ...|$|E
