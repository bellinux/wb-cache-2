25|$|Stewart grew up {{with both}} his mother and father, but his mother died {{while he was a}} {{teenager}} and his father remarried. His mother was part of the Dudgeon sept of the Noresmen. His mother was thought to be a major influence in Stewart’s life from whom he received his love and appreciation for beauty. He was a cab proprietor and later ran a farm called Pictstonhill. He was a very religious man and influenced Stewart towards missionary work. Stewart had a desire from a young age to go to Africa. He told his cousin, “I shall never be satisfied till I am in Africa with a Bible in my pocket, and a rifle on my shoulder to supply my wants.” From a very young age, James Stewart <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to do with his life: be a missionary in Africa.|$|E
500|$|When Paoli was young, {{his parents}} would often {{take him to}} operas at Ponce's La Perla Theater located {{a block away from}} Paoli's residence. There, on one {{occasion}} he saw a performance of Giuseppe Verdi's Il Trovatore by Italian tenor, Pietro Baccei, and at that moment <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to do as an adult. His parents were very supportive of his ambition and guided him on this route during his youth, enrolling him in a school of [...] "voice" [...] directed by Ramon Marin. His sister Amalia was a soprano who performed at La Perla in Emilio Arrieta's opera, Marina. In 1883, when Paoli was only 12 years old, both his parents died and he went to live in Spain with his sister Amalia.|$|E
500|$|The title track, {{although}} not {{released in the}} US as a single until 1977, received heavy play in FM radio formats. [...] "Into the Mystic" [...] has also gained a wide following over the years. [...] "Come Running", which reached the American Top 40, rescued Morrison from what seemed then as Hot 100 obscurity. Moondance was both well received and favourably reviewed. Lester Bangs and Greil Marcus had a combined full page review in Rolling Stone, saying Morrison now had [...] "the striking imagination of a consciousness that is visionary in the strongest sense of the word." [...] "That {{was the type of}} band I dig," [...] Morrison said of the Moondance sessions. [...] "Two horns and a rhythm section – they're the type of bands that I like best." [...] He produced the album himself as he felt like nobody else <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted.</b> Moondance was listed at number sixty-five on the Rolling Stone magazine's The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In March 2007, Moondance was listed as number seventy-two on the NARM Rock and Roll Hall of Fame list of the [...] "Definitive 200".|$|E

2500|$|Churchill {{later wrote}} that Robertson [...] "was an {{outstanding}} military personality. His vision as a strategist was not profound … {{he had no}} ideas of his own, but a sensible judgement negative in bias" [...] but he also commented that Robertson [...] "had never himself at any time led even a troop in action, and whose war duties involved him in no more risk than many clerks".

2500|$|Series {{producer}} Craig-Brown {{revealed the}} [...] "biggest challenge" [...] was {{to distinguish the}} storyline from other sexuality plots featured in other dramas.

[...] She also confirmed it would be a long-running story arc for the character. Astill also shared her sentiment stating it was a [...] "new direction" [...] for the programme. He said it would be easy for Dan to [...] "come out" [...] if he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted.</b> Hobley later revealed Dan is [...] "moving things too fast", which has a negative effect on her training. He is annoyed with Chrissie when Malick offers her theatre slots. She added [...] "Dan doesn't respect what she is trying to do [...] Dan's reaction makes her see red". Hobley revealed that Dan's affair begins to come between them – [...] "so when she finds out what Dan has been up to under her nose all hell is going to break loose." ...|$|E

60|$|Ditmar <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted.</b> Of {{the mill}} {{he was the}} {{absolute}} master, familiar with every process, carrying constantly in his mind how many spindles, how many looms were at work; and if anything untoward happened, becoming aware of it by what seemed to Janet a subconscious process, sending for the superintendent of the department: for Mr. Orcutt, perhaps, whose office was across the hall--a tall, lean, spectacled man of fifty who looked like a schoolmaster.|$|E
60|$|He kept {{falling in}} love with stenographers and waitresses, with actresses whom he never met. He was never satisfied. He didn't at all <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted,</b> but <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> {{something}} stronger than himself.|$|R

60|$|But Elsa and Andor had {{remained}} behind close beside the shrine.

60|$|He {{went off}} and Mrs. Winter mused. Jim {{generally}} <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted,</b> but his attitude was puzzling now. Although he meant to marry Evelyn and imagined he loved her, Mrs. Winter doubted. She wondered whether Evelyn had, so to speak, dazzled him by her grace and beauty. Jim was resolute and practical, but not clever. Mrs. Winter sighed and imagined she had been foolish to let Carrie stay so long, {{but she could not}} see her way. Jim would not be married until he had drained the marsh and Jake would not go before the work was finished. Mrs. Winter admitted that he could not go.|$|E

60|$|But {{it was not}} {{in pursuit}} of a ship that the swift keel of the Badger cut through the sea, this way and that, now on a long course, now {{doubling}} back again, like a hound fancying he has got the scent of a hare, then raging wildly when he finds the scent is false; it was in pursuit of a woman that every sail was spread, that the lookout swept the sea, and that the hot brain of the captain worked steadily and hard. This English man-of-war was on a cruise to make Kate Bonnet the bride of its captain. The heart of this naval lover was very steady; it was fixed in its purpose, nothing could turn it aside. Vince's plans were well-digested; he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to do, he knew {{how he was going to}} do it.|$|E
60|$|No {{man could}} {{now say that}} the former captain of the Revenge was not an {{accomplished}} and seasoned desperado. Even the great Blackbeard would not have cared to give him nicknames, nor dared to play his blithesome tricks upon him; he was now no more Captain Nightcap to any man. His crew of hairy ruffians had learned to understand that he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted,</b> and, more than that, {{he knew how to}} order it done. They listened to his great oaths and they respected him. This powerful pirate now commanded a small fleet, for in the cove where lay his flag-ship also lay two good-sized sloops, manned by their own crews, which he had captured in Delaware Bay and had brought down with him to this quiet spot, a few miles up the Cape Fear River, where now he was repairing his own ship, which had had a hard time of it since she had again come into his hands.|$|E
60|$|On {{the next}} morning he had an {{interview}} with Branscombe Denham in the library, which left him with a very unpleasant impression. In fact, the silence he forced himself to maintain hurt him, and he felt {{it would have been a}} vast relief to tell the fastidious, immaculately dressed gentleman precisely what he thought of him. Having on certain delicately implied conditions secured his goodwill, Leland set about the prosecution of his suit with a directness and singleness of purpose that was a matter of delight to those who watched his proceedings. He, however, was quite oblivious of their amusement. He <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted,</b> and it did not matter in the least that others should guess it, too, but, apart from his obvious directness, he played the suitor with a grave, old-fashioned gallantry and deference that became him. In fact, since it was by no means what they expected from him, they wondered how he came to have it. Though Leland himself could not have told them its source, it had been his practice in the long nights, when Prospect lay silent under the Arctic frost, to read and ponder over the best of the early Victorian novelists. His mother had been a woman of taste, and he had, perhaps, unconsciously acquired from the books she had left him some of the mannerisms of a more punctilious time.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh yes. I {{wanted to}} do it all.' <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> to do it, and he had done it. But God <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to do it for. He had now one day at Lucerne, one day at Interlaken and Berne, then London.|$|R
