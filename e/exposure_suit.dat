25|$|The main {{components}} of the average scuba diver's equipment which are positively buoyant are the {{components of the}} <b>exposure</b> <b>suit.</b> The two most commonly used <b>exposure</b> <b>suit</b> types are the dry suit and the wet suit. Both of these types of <b>exposure</b> <b>suit</b> use gas spaces to provide insulation, and these gas spaces are inherently buoyant. The buoyancy of a wet suit will decrease significantly with an increase in depth as the ambient pressure causes the volume of the gas bubbles in the neoprene to decrease. A dry suit will also compress with depth, but the air space inside is continuous and can be topped up from a cylinder or vented to maintain a moderately constant volume. A large part of the ballast used by a diver is to balance the buoyancy of this gas space.|$|E
25|$|The diver's harness is an item {{of strong}} webbing, and {{sometimes}} cloth, which is fastened around a diver over the <b>exposure</b> <b>suit,</b> and allows the diver to be lifted without risk of {{falling out of the}} harness. Several types are in use.|$|E
25|$|Divers {{working in}} cold water, {{particularly}} when breathing helium based gases, which increase {{the rate of}} heat transfer, may rapidly lose body heat and suffer from hypothermia, which is unhealthy, and reduces diver effectiveness. This is can be ameliorated with a hot water system. A diver hot water system heats filtered seawater and pumps it to the divers through the bell and diver umbilicals. This water is used to heat the breathing gas before it is inhaled, and flows through the diver's <b>exposure</b> <b>suit</b> to keep the diver warm.|$|E

25|$|The {{certified}} scuba diver {{is expected}} to be able to assess what type of diving <b>exposure</b> <b>suit</b> is suitable for the planned dive, and to check that it is in safe usable condition, that it is the right size, and to dress correctly in it. Entry level skills usually cover wet suits, but in countries where the water and/or weather conditions are very cold, dry suit skills may be considered an entry level skill. In other parts of the world, dry suit skills are considered a specialty skill. Where dry suits are used, the skills of using the dry suit safely during a dive are also necessary. These include equalizing, buoyancy control, inversion recovery, emergency venting and blowup recovery. Recreational divers trained in warm tropical waters may have no skills in the use of diving suits.|$|E
25|$|A {{backplate}} and wing {{is a type}} of scuba harness with an attached buoyancy compensation device (BCD) which establishes {{neutral buoyancy}} underwater and positive buoyancy on the surface. Unlike most BCDs, the backplate and wing is a modular system, in that it consists of separable components. The core components of this system are the backplate, usually made from metal, which is held against the diver’s back by the harness, and to which the diver’s primary cylinder or cylinders are attached, and inflatable buoyancy bladder known as a wing, sandwiched between the backplate and the cylinder(s), used for adjusting the buoyancy of the diver when in the water. This arrangement clears the front and sides of the diver for other equipment to be attached in the region where it is easily accessible. This additional equipment is usually suspended from the harness or carried in pockets on the <b>exposure</b> <b>suit.</b>|$|E
25|$|In free diving (breathhold) {{the weight}} system is almost {{exclusively}} a weight belt with quick release buckle, as the emergency {{release of the}} weights will usually allow the diver to float to the surface even if unconscious, where {{there is at least}} a chance of rescue. The weights are used mainly to neutralise the buoyancy of the <b>exposure</b> <b>suit,</b> as the diver is nearly neutral in most cases, and there is little other equipment carried. The weights required depend almost entirely on the buoyancy of the suit. Most free divers will weight themselves to be positively buoyant at the surface, and use only enough weight to minimise the effort required to swim down against the buoyancy {{at the start of a}} dive, while retaining sufficient buoyancy at maximum depth to not require too much effort to swim back up to where the buoyancy becomes positive again. As a corollary to this practice, freedivers will use as thin a wetsuit as comfortably possible, to minimise buoyancy changes with depth due to suit compression.|$|E
25|$|Water conducts heat around 25 {{times more}} {{efficiently}} than air. Hypothermia, a potentially fatal condition, occurs when the human body's core temperature falls below 35°C. Insulating the body's warmth from water is {{the main purpose of}} diving <b>suits</b> and <b>exposure</b> <b>suits</b> when used in water temperatures below 25°C.|$|R
25|$|Dry {{suits are}} better thermal {{protection}} than most wetsuits, and isolate the diver {{from the environment}} more effectively than other <b>exposure</b> <b>suits.</b> When diving in contaminated water, a drysuit with integral boots, sealed dry gloves and a helmet sealed directly to the suit provides the best environmental isolation. The suit material must be selected to be compatible with the expected contaminants. Thermal undersuits can be matched to the expected water temperature.|$|R
50|$|Most {{risks are}} {{preventable}} {{with the use}} of <b>exposure</b> <b>suits.</b> Wet-suits are typically pre-warmed with warm water in order to keep divers warm throughout a frozen competition. Three finger mitts are usually recommended. Smaller body parts such as fingers, toes, ears, and the nose are at the highest risk for frostbite and are the most vital to keep covered and warmed. Divers are also warned against heavy exercise after resurfacing from the ice. Decompression sickness has not been studied enough for extreme cold and any measures taken to prevent causing sickness is recommended.|$|R

At the same time, the B-29 bombers and the battleships continued their bombing raids. Because of the naval gunfire and aerial bombardment, the Japanese commander, General Kuribayashi, mistakenly sensed that the Americans were coming in for a main invasion and opened fire. The infantry landing crafts and the enemy Japanese forces began exchanging fire from their 20 mm, 40 mm and 4.5-inch rockets over the combat swimmers (both the Marines and UDT) in the water.|$|R
50|$|Rubberized suits, {{weighted}} {{belts and}} shoes, and helmets {{are used for}} deep sea diving. Diving bells, open helmets, atmospheric diving suits were used. Deep sea exploration today is accomplished using Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus (“SCUBA”), unmanned submersible vehicles, Remote Operating Vehicles (“ROVs”), and <b>exposure</b> <b>suits.</b> Sound Navigation and Ranging (“Sonar”) and magnetometers are used for detection of treasure. Hand tools, probes, screens, containers, shovels, metal detectors, and sifters are useful for land treasure hunting (Smith, 1971). The Evinrude Aquanaut is a portable floating diving unit that feeds air directly to the divers without need of tanks on the divers.In diving, masks allow for improved vision, fins increase swimming speeds, safety vests provide lifesaving assistance, diver’s flags alert others of a diver’s location, wetsuits conserve body heat and also provide skin protection, weight belts offset buoyancy of rubber suits, knives prove useful as a tool, tanks supply air, and snorkels conserve energy.|$|R

40|$|During the mid- 19802 ̆ 7 s, {{the crisis}} in marine {{insurance}} and growing concern over fishing vessel safety combined to stimulate passage of the Commercial Fishing Industry Vessel Safety Act of 1988. This law was enacted {{with the goal of}} improving the overall safety of commercial fishing industry vessels. However, the Act as passed by Congress contained no provisions for marine insurance reform. As a result, the commercial Fishing Industry Vessel Safety Act offered little incentive for the industry to improve upon its dubious safety record. With the exception of self-insurance clubs, the vast burden of implementing the Act has fallen upon the U. S. Coast Guard. Implementation of any congressional mandate necessarily involved identification of Congressional intent. In the case of the Commercial Fishing Industry Vessel Safety Act, the intent of Congress was to promote a proactive risk management system and the use of voyage terminations as a primary enforcement mechanism. Unfortunately, this policy has been implemented within the Coast Guard such that the authority to terminate a fishing vessel voyage is concentrated at a high level within that agency, and the Coast Guard has been precluded from effectively utilizing the enforcement tool which Congress provided for in the Act. Instead, the Coast Guard has focused its enforcement efforts on post-contact control measures such as mandating <b>exposure</b> <b>suits</b> and life rafts, and in so doing has missed the opportunity to prevent accidents by creating a new risk management regime. By refocusing enforcement efforts within the Coast Guard {{in order to create a}} more effective risk management system, the fishing vessel safety program currently in place in this country could be vastly improved. Likewise, a more aggressive data gathering protocol and the utilization of risk management methodology to measure and identify hazards within the commercial fishing industry is necessary to the effectiveness of this program...|$|R
40|$|Demographic {{methods can}} {{translate}} toxicant effects on individuals into consequences for populations. To date few such {{studies have been}} conducted with longer-lived invertebrates. This is because full life-cycle experiments are difficult with such species. Here we report the effects of copper and cadmium on the key demographic parameter intrinsic rate of population increase (r) in a long-lived invertebrate (an earthworm). The approach used to derive r was based on robust measurement of effects oil life-cycle traits in three specifically designed toxicity tests and integration of this data within a demographic model. The three laboratory tests used to generate values for specific life-cycle parameters under copper and cadmium <b>exposure</b> were <b>suited</b> to the task. Significant effects on a range of separate adult and juvenile life-cycle parameters were seen. Integration of parameter values within the demographic equation indicated that for copper, r was reduced only at a concentration that also caused adult mortality. For cadmium. a more graded exposure-dependent effect on fitness was seen. with r reduced at sublethal concentrations. The concentration response patterns for r found for the two metals suggest significantly different consequences for earthworm populations exposed to sublethal levels of copper and cadmium...|$|R

40|$|Fixed {{tobramycin}} (mg/kg) dosing {{is often}} inappropriate {{in patients with}} cystic fibrosis (CF), as pharmacokinetics are highly variable. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) is an <b>exposure</b> metric <b>suited</b> to monitoring in this population. Bayesian strategies to estimate AUC have been available for over 20 years but are not standard practice in the clinical setting. To assess their suitability for use in clinical practice, three AUC estimation methods using limited sampling were compared to measured true exposure by using intensive sampling tobramycin data. Adults prescribed once daily intravenous tobramycin had eight concentrations taken over 24 h. An estimate of true exposure within one dosing interval was calculated using the trapezoidal method and compared to three alternate estimates determined using (i) a two-sample log-linear regression (LLR) method (local hospital practice); (ii) a Bayesian estimate using one concentration (AUC(1)); and (iii) a Bayesian estimate using two concentrations (AUC(2)). Each method was evaluated against the true measured exposure by a Bland-Altman analysis. Twelve patients with a median (range) age and weight of 25 (18 to 36) years and 66. 5 (51 to 76) kg, respectively, were recruited. There was good agreement between the true exposure and the three alternate estimates of AUC, with a mean AUC bias of < 10 mg/liter center dot h in each case, i. e., - 8. 2 (LLR), 3. 8 (AUC(1)), and 1. 0 (AUC(2)). Bayesian analysis-based and LLR estimation methods of tobramycin AUC are equivalent to true exposure estimation. All three methods may be suitable {{for use in the}} clinical setting; however, a one-sample Bayesian method may be most useful in ambulatory patients for which coordinating blood samples is difficult. Suitably powered, randomized clinical trials are required to assess patient outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Born in 1932 to Croatian American {{farmers in}} the Santa Clara Valley town of Cupertino, Betty Van Dyke saw her fertile home ground transformed, in a few decades, from {{seemingly}} endless orchards to unrelenting urban sprawl. As the energetic matriarch of a popular family-run fruit-growing business, she has since participated in the region’s organic agricultural renaissance, overseeing {{one of the first}} California operations to grow and dry fruit organically (becoming certified in 1986), and playing {{an active role in the}} early days of California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF). And as a member of one of the region’s noted surfing families, she built this thriving business while sustaining her love affair with Pacific ocean waves. Van Dyke Ranch sits at the base of the Gavilan Mountains in Gilroy, Santa Clara County, on a southern <b>exposure</b> perfectly <b>suited</b> for growing sweet, flavorful Blenheim apricots and Bing cherries. The ranch produces fresh fruit in season and dried apricots, cherries, nectarines, peaches, pears, and persimmons throughout the year. (A rarer delicacy available to a few farmers’-market patrons are home-grown capers, the pickled flower buds of plants propagated from a thirty-year-old bush planted by Betty’s mother.) Betty Van Dyke and her three sons took over from her father in the mid- 1970 s. While son Peter and various grandchildren now carry most of the day-to-day responsibility for the ranch, Betty still holds down two weekly farmers’-market booths, and commutes frequently to Gilroy from her Santa Cruz home to help with ranch work during busy seasons. Sarah Rabkin interviewed Betty Van Dyke at Rabkin’s Soquel home on April 16, 2008. A lively storyteller with an easy smile, Van Dyke shared memories of picking apricots on her grandfather’s farm as a small child, working and playing alongside migrant dust-bowl refugees from Oklahoma and Arkansas, discovering surfing as a college student in the 1950 s, and running an evolving Van Dyke Ranch...|$|R
