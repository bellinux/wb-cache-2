25|$|On December 18, 1941, Johnson {{reported}} to the Missouri Institute of Aeronautics, a civilian contractor school in Sikeston, Missouri, for Primary Flying Training. His first five hours of the pre-solo training phase were flown in a PT-19A, {{in which he was}} instructed in spin recoveries, stalls, and basic turning maneuvers. He then began nearly sixty hours of Primary training in the more agile PT-18 Kaydet, practicing aerobatic maneuvers. All of the training, which included more than 175 landings, was conducted in open-cockpit trainers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>of</b> <b>winter.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the fairy-tale play The Twelve Months by Russian writer Samuil Marshak, a greedy queen decrees that {{a basket}} of gold coins shall be rewarded to anyone who can bring her galanthus flowers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>of</b> <b>winter.</b> A young orphan girl is sent out during a snow storm by her cruel {{stepmother}} to find {{the spirits of the}} 12 months of the year, who take pity on her and not only save her from freezing to death, but also make it possible for her to gather the flowers even in winter. The Soviet traditionally animated film The Twelve Months (1956), Lenfilm film The Twelve Months (1972) and the anime film Twelve Months (1980) (Sekai meisaku dowa mori wa ikiteiru in Japan) are based on this fairy-tale play.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1900 s the Everett Mills, {{like all the}} other Lawrence mills were staffed mainly with European {{immigrants}} who were underpaid and overworked. When a law was passed in Massachusetts reducing the maximum number of hours that could be worked weekly by women and children, the mill owners reduced their workers’ pay accordingly and the Bread and Roses strike of 1912 erupted. Believing that a workforce of women and ethnically self-segregated immigrants living paycheck to paycheck could never band together to achieve a common goal, the mill owners were proved wrong with the strike that shut down the mills for two months <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>of</b> <b>winter.</b> Originating with female Polish weavers at the Everett Mills who revolted upon receiving pay reduced by thirty-two cents, soon 20,000 millworkers were on strike. Helped by the Industrial Workers of the World labor union who organized meetings with representatives from all affected ethnic communities, fundraisers to support the millworkers while they were on strike, and highly visible protests meant to arouse nationwide support and outrage at national labor norms, the workers won pay increases and time-and-a-quarter for overtime work. The strike had far reaching consequences across the country when mill owners in other cities and states voluntarily raised pay in fear of similar uprisings by their own workers.|$|E

500|$|On June 5, 1799, Asa Danforth Jr. began {{construction}} eastward from Toronto {{on a road}} {{which was}} to extend the Governor's Road through Port Hope and to the Trent River.

It would be extended in 1802 to reach the Bay of Quinte at Stone Mills (now Glenora) and a ferry crossing established to Adolphustown. The Bath extension of the Danforth Road (1802) provided access to a key early colonial road, the Bath Road, which had long joined Bath to Kingston.|$|E

2500|$|Colter left Fort Raymond in October, 1807 with a pack {{weighing}} roughly {{thirty five}} pounds (not including his rifle and ammunition,) and traveled over five hundred miles to establish {{trade with the}} Crow nation. Over {{the course of the}} winter, he explored the region that later became Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks. Colter reportedly visited at least one geyser basin, though it is now believed that he most likely was near present-day Cody, Wyoming, which at that time may have had some geothermal activity to the immediate west. Colter probably passed along portions of the shores of Jackson Lake after crossing the Continental Divide near Togwotee Pass or more likely, Union Pass in the northern Wind River Range. Colter then explored Jackson Hole below the Teton Range, later crossing Teton Pass into Pierre's Hole, known today as the Teton Basin in the state of Idaho. After heading north and then east, he is believed to have encountered Yellowstone Lake, another location in which he may have seen geysers and other geothermal features. Colter then proceeded back to Fort Raymond, arriving in March or April 1808. Not only had Colter traveled hundreds of miles, much of the time unguided, he did so <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>of</b> <b>winter,</b> in a region in which nighttime temperatures in January are routinely [...]|$|E
2500|$|On December 19, {{he struck}} north again, {{retracing}} his path. He crossed Monida Pass, then turned east after crossing the Beaverhead Mountains, {{passing through a}} broad prairie between the Pioneer Mountains and the Ruby Range. He followed the Beaverhead River to the Jefferson River again, then explored the Gallatin Valley before turning west to the Big Hole River again. Turning north, he followed a stream until he reached a series of low ridges which divided the Big Hole tributary from the Hellgate Fork of the Bitterroot River. [...] Crossing these, {{he arrived at the}} headwaters of the Deer Lodge River (now known as the Clark Fork River) on December 31. He followed the Deer Lodge River to the Hellgate Fork, and retraced his path back to Fort Owen, which he reached on January 10. Mullan and his men had traveled through heavy snows and strong winds that drove the wind chill tens of degrees below zero, crossed rivers and streams covered in thin ice (through which their horses frequently plunged), and often went hungry.
