40|$|We {{report a}} {{significant}} poleward surge in thermospheric winds at subauroral and midlatitudes following the 17 – 18 March 2015 great geomagnetic storm. This premidnight surge is preceded by strong westward winds. These disturbances were observed over three sites with <b>geodetic</b> <b>latitudes</b> 35 – 42 °N in the American sector by Fabry-Perot interferometers at 630 [*]nm wavelength. Prior {{to the wind}} disturbances, subauroral polarization streams (SAPS) were measured by the Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar between 20 and 02 [*]UT. We identify the observed neutral wind variations as driven by SAPS, through a scenario where strong ion flows cause a westward neutral wind, subsequently establishing a poleward wind surge due to the poleward Coriolis force on that westward wind. These regional disturbances appear to have prevented the well-known storm time equatorward wind surge from propagating into low latitudes, with the consequence that the classic disturbance dynamo mechanism failed to occur.

25|$|The {{formulae}} in {{the previous}} sections give the auxiliary latitude {{in terms of the}} <b>geodetic</b> <b>latitude.</b> The expressions for the geocentric and reduced latitudes may be inverted directly but this is impossible in the four remaining cases: the rectifying, authalic, conformal, and isometric latitudes. There are two methods of proceeding. The first is a numerical inversion of the defining equation for each and every particular value of the auxiliary latitude. The methods available are fixed-point iteration and Newton–Raphson root finding. The other, more useful, approach is to express the auxiliary latitude as a series in terms of the <b>geodetic</b> <b>latitude</b> and then invert the series by the method of Lagrange reversion. Such series are presented by Adams who uses Taylor series expansions and gives coefficients in terms of the eccentricity. Osborne derives series to arbitrary order by using the computer algebra package Maxima and expresses the coefficients in terms of both eccentricity and flattening. The series method is not applicable to the isometric latitude and one must use the conformal latitude in an intermediate step.|$|E

40|$|A vehicle {{simulation}} is "surface-interacting" if {{the state}} of the vehicle (position, velocity, and acceleration) relative to the surface is important. Surface-interacting simulations perform ascent, entry, descent, landing, surface travel, or atmospheric flight. The dynamics of surface-interacting simulations are influenced by the modeling of gravity. Gravity is the sum of gravitation and the centrifugal acceleration due to the world s rotation. Both components are functions of position relative to the world s center and that position for a given set of <b>geodetic</b> coordinates (<b>latitude,</b> longitude, and altitude) depends on the world model (world shape and dynamics). Thus, gravity fidelity depends on the fidelities of the gravitation model and the world model and on the interaction of the gravitation and world model. A surface-interacting simulation cannot treat the gravitation separately from the world model.

This study starts with derivations for a 3 D variant of Gaussian ray bundles in this coordinate system. To verify the accuracy of this approach, acoustic propagation predictions of transmission loss, time of arrival, and propagation direction are compared to analytic solutions and other models.

40|$|Two- and {{three-dimensional}} {{coordinate systems}} are fundamental to most quantitative mapping applications. The Geodetic, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM),and State Plane systems have traditional roles in various science, surveying, and government agency engineering applications. The coordinates of three-dimensional <b>Geodetic</b> system are <b>latitude,</b> longitude, and height above ellipsoid (HAE). Because {{of its ability}} to cope with the intrinsically three dimensional character of the earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface, the Geodetic system is capable of supporting precise relative positioning and very high accuracy computations of distance between any two positions on or near the earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface. The two-dimensional UTMand State Plane systems are extremely useful for the local horizontal positioning and scaling required for paper maps of county-size land areas. In the two plane systems, horizontal distance computation is a very straightforward application of the distance formula (analytic geometry) based on the Pythagorean theorem. Although precision line- and geodesic- distance formulas based on geodetic coordinates are more complex, useful horizontal distance estimates are easily derived from the latitudes and longitudes of two positions. This paper examines this premise for Arkansas. The approach to estimating horizontal distances utilizes an application of the distance formula in conjunction with an assumed constant distance/unit latitude of 30. 8 m (arc sec) 2 ̆ 2 1. Alinear regression equation is used to represent distance/unit longitude as a function of latitude in Arkansas. The approximation math is extremely simple, and the process as a whole is equivalent to a portable coordinate projection...|$|R

40|$|Position, {{velocity}} and time (PVT) {{can be calculated}} from Global Positioning System (GPS). Two types of GPS measurement models are present, code phase measurement model and carrier phase measurement model. Range measurement in GPS is affected by different types of errors including atmospheric, multipath, satellite and receiver clock and ephemeris errors. Atmospheric errors are the biggest source of error amongst these. Receivers within close proximity to each other face mostly same atmospheric errors from GPS signal. Several differential techniques have been developed {{during the last few}} years to mitigate these common errors. It means that the accuracy can be improved by using multiple receivers which mitigate the majority of errors. Real Time Kinematic (RTK) concept uses carrier phase measurements, which have high accuracy. RTK concept was originally developed for application such as surveying. The unknown ambiguity in the number of cycle between each satellite and receiver node is the main issue in RTK technique, moreover these ambiguities are integer numbers. Once the ambiguity is solved, it remains constant as long as the receiver maintains a phase lock on satellites signals. However, the loss of phase lock results in cycle slips and the ambiguity needs to solve again. In this work, RTKLIB, an open source software, is used for the RTK GPS positioning. Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) is known since early 1900 s with synonymous terms such as impulse, time domain, nonsinusoidal, baseband, carrier free, orthogonal function and large relative bandwidth radio signals. The huge frequency bandwidth of UWB makes it suitable for positioning and navigation applications. Multipath resistance, high accuracy, low cost and low power implementation are other features of UWB. The huge bandwidth in frequency domain corresponds to short pulse in time domain, usually of nanosecond (ns) order. The Time of arrival (TOA), the time difference of arrival (TDOA) and the received signal strength (RSS) are known methods to calculate the range between the source and the target through UWB. TOA and TDOA are highly accurate but have clock synchronization problem. To overcome this problem, a modified method known as two-way time-of-flight can be used. BeSpoon phone equipped with UWB is used here for UWB ranging. To summarize the previous discussion, RTK GPS positioning has a high accuracy but has integer ambiguity resolution problem which causes cycle slips and requires good satellite visibility as well. Moreover RTK GPS positioning solution is for outdoor applications only and has high dynamic outdoor range. UWB, on the other hand, can give highly accurate positioning solution but has low dynamic range. UWB can be used for both indoor and outdoor applications. Moreover, high bandwidth of UWB makes it multipath resistant and as result can be used in shadow areas. Thus, the fusion of RTK GPS and UWB positioning may compensates the limitations of both and result in better performance system. In this thesis a Kalman filter is used for fusion of UWB and RTK GPS positioning solutions. UWB gives range from tags which are in meter and relative to BeSpoon phone while RTK GPS positioning solution is in <b>geodetic</b> coordinates form (<b>latitude</b> and longitude). Three steps are involved in fusion; first, convert UWB ranges to position in local coordinate by using trilateration, second, convert geodetic coordinates of RTK GPS to local coordinates through rotation matrix and third, use Kalman filter for fusion of both positioning data. The main goal of the thesis is the fusion of both RTK GPS and UWB positioning solutions with the help of Kalman filter in order to obtain better performance compare to stand-alone RTK GPS. Tampere University of Technology (TUT) parking area is used for testing. One corner of TUT parking area has the known coordinate point which is used for the base station of RTK GPS. Reference track and tags positions are drawn through Laser instrument Leica TPS 1200 which has millimeter level of accuracy. Measurement results show that the fusion of UWB and RTK GPS positioning solutions have better performance compared to stand-alone RTK GPS solution. Whenever measurement from RTK GPS gives erroneous/missing result, the measurement from UWB sensor corrects it and the resulting solution from filter has better performance...|$|R
