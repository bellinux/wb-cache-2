500|$|Shand: How {{could you}} really have {{thought that he had}} behaved in a manner {{befitting}} worthy representatives of Australia and {{on and off the field}} his conduct was exemplary <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> his conduct was so serious as to warrant his omission from the team? How do you reconcile those two? ...|$|E
2500|$|Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly {{gave it a}} good review: [...] "And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> we {{were done}} with surprises to set up next season, {{let me assure you}} we’re just getting started. Who shows up in Chinatown? None other than the Evil Queen, who claims “Regina never should have let me out to play.” And this is a war now. You thought the Big Bad for season 6 was Hyde? Try Dark Regina instead. And yes, I’m into it. Lana Parrilla {{is one of the best}} things about this show, and I’ll take {{anything}} that gives her a chance to flex her acting chops." ...|$|E
60|$|Or {{you might}} omit the stanza altogether, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> proper, the piece being long enough without it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Listen,' she said, 'and try to understand. If I {{thought she}} hated him, I {{would tell her}} something. <b>If</b> she <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> hated them, {{he would tell me}} something. <b>If</b> ye or <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> he hated her, I would tell him something. I will wait and see.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is a {{good deal}} you and the boys at Cedar don't know, Larry. Any way, lots of people sing better than I do, but I should be angry with <b>you</b> <b>if</b> I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> were pleased." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And why not? I {{think that}} is nonsense, Caroline. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> really <b>thought</b> that, <b>you</b> would not receive him as you will do, nor his friend neither." ...|$|R
60|$|BUILDER. [Suddenly revolting] No! <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> it a sin--I--might. But you don't; you're {{nothing but}} a--a little heathen.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't say mädchen,' he cried, petulantly. 'It {{sounds as}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> {{me one of}} those sentimental Germans. I hate sentiment.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought,</b> Herbert, {{that you}} could, without doing any injury to your business, leave the {{question}} {{open for a}} little while--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{very good}} of you; {{that will save}} me the trouble; and perhaps save Miss Gresham too. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> have <b>thought</b> it over thoroughly, that will do for all." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{pulled the}} bell {{almost as if}} in some inward triumph. 'But don't you think,' she suggested, 'that that, like the other, might be, as it were, partly {{imagination}} too? <b>If</b> now <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> back.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've left {{too much}} to <b>you</b> already. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> hadn't <b>thought</b> it was {{necessary}} to make the acquaintance of every fellow who was going to the fair I'd have my fifteen dollars in my cap now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{was rather}} obvious," [...] Agatha rejoined with some dryness. [...] "But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> {{we would be}} disappointed, why did you come?" ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. H. Very likely <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> that {{it would}} flatter your vanity. You'd cry {{my name on the}} house-tops to make people turn round.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Mr. Robinson, don't {{you talk}} like that. You wouldn't {{take it all}} calm that way <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> {{she was going to}} have him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Rather a good scheme {{occurred}} to me, that is, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> haven't <b>thought</b> over {{the idea of}} that trip on my yacht and decided it would bore you to death. You still feel like making one of the party--what?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yet, I {{think you}} must have been {{convinced}} of it. That he told you why he was going proves that you were on friendly terms, which would have been impossible <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had <b>thought</b> him guilty. What has made you change?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir; I've {{no reason}} to suppose you haven't told me the truth, {{as far as it}} goes. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> have <b>thought</b> it {{advisable}} to keep anything back from me, you may wish to tell the whole story to an attorney." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. H. Very likely <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> that {{it would}} flatter your vanity. You'd cry {{my name on the}} house-tops to make people turn round.|$|E
6000|$|Henrietta looked disappointed, and her steady gaze betrayed it. [...] "You don't {{ask that}} right--as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> it important. You're changed--you're {{thinking}} of other things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After all, cousin, it {{was very}} natural in you to say so, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> so; though I should not have {{supposed}} you would think so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{like you}} when you talk like that, Uncle Harry--that is, I shouldn't like <b>you</b> <b>if</b> I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> meant it; but you only talk so out of contradiction. If I had said I thought Frank was very foolish for having gone into the water, you would have taken the {{opposite}} side directly." ...|$|R
6000|$|She did not answer, and he {{felt that}} he had been seeking a mean advantage. He went on: [...] "If you didn't expect it, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> never <b>thought</b> that I was coming, there's no need for me to tell you {{anything}} else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh dear, no, Master Copperfield!' {{returned}} Uriah. 'Oh, believe me, no! Such {{a thought}} never {{came into my}} head! I shouldn't have deemed it at all proud <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had <b>thought</b> US too umble for you. Because we are so very umble.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{all very}} well saying that; but you wouldn't be {{moderate}} if Noningsby were on fire, or <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> the judge was going to die." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you would}} go away <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> that she took any warmer {{interest}} in you than ladies generally do in men engaged to be married." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'One thing more,' said Lily, looking down; 'after {{this great}} fall, ought I {{to come to}} next Sunday's feast? I would turn away <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> fit.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There's genteel {{comedy in}} your walk and manner, {{juvenile}} tragedy in your eye, and touch-and-go farce in your laugh,' said Mr Vincent Crummles. 'You'll {{do as well}} as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had <b>thought</b> of nothing else but the lamps, from your birth downwards.' ...|$|R
6000|$|DEAR WEBSTER,--I {{can hardly}} invite a gentleman {{to my house}} a second time who walked out of it the first in so {{singular}} a mood, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had <b>thought</b> proper to pay me a visit, {{you would have had}} a [...] "Highland Welcome." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And lose {{thirteen}} cottages {{and this}} ship and my {{berth in the}} bargain," [...] said the skipper. [...] "Now you try and think of some other way, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> haven’t <b>thought</b> of it by dinner-time, I’ll tell you what I’m going to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can laugh, but I sha'n't rest {{after seeing}} this. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> I {{was going to}} say, 'Oh, how picturesque!' you're mistaken. I think it's barbarous." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I fancied," [...] Jimmy broke in. [...] "Those {{things are}} rather a mockery, {{but of course}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> it would help you in any way----" ...|$|E
6000|$|Ida. Yes, but I do {{not like}} the name; methinks [...] It sounds so cold, as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> upon [...] Our pedigree, and only weighed our blood.|$|E
6000|$|... "La, la! I {{speak in}} the Queen's name. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> have <b>thought</b> to aid the Dowager of Condillac in this {{resistance}} of Her Majesty's mandate, let me enjoin you, as you value your seneschalship--as you value your very neck--to harbour that thought no longer.|$|R
6000|$|BIGELOW--[Distractedly.] For {{the love}} of God, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have such <b>thoughts,</b> keep them to yourself. I won't listen! You make me despise life! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't mean anything, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't. I <b>thought</b> {{from your}} {{beginning}} to defend {{yourself that you}} felt yourself {{to be in the}} wrong." ...|$|R
