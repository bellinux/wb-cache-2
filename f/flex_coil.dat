40|$|Increased signal {{intensity}} on {{magnetic resonance}} (MR) imaging of tendons {{arising from the}} magic angle phenomenon is well recognized. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of varying the echo time (TE) upon tendon signal intensity, and {{to determine if a}} modified TE value produces acceptable T 1 and proton density (PD) weighted images. Fresh bovine tendons were imaged in a 1. 5 T MR scanner using spin echo (SE) T 1 and PD weighted sequences and utilizing a number of different coils. For each set of sequences, the tendon was orientated at 55 degrees to the main magnetic field (B 0) and imaged using constant TR and incremental TE values. Signal intensity was measured on images at each TR/TE value and compared with the signal intensities of tendons orientated at 0 degree to B 0, obtained using minimum TE values. This experiment was repeated with a 1. 0 T MR scanner and utilizing a spine coil. The Achilles tendon of a human volunteer was similarly imaged using a general purpose <b>flex</b> <b>coil.</b> For bovine and human tendons orientated at 55 degrees to B 0, the signal intensities decreased exponentially with increasing TE. A critical TE value exceeding 37 ms, for each sequence, reduced the signal intensities to the levels obtained with the tendons orientated at 0 degree to B 0, such that the magic angle phenomenon could be avoided. Although there was variability of the signal intensities with different coils, the critical TE value remained constant and the anatomical clarity was not degraded. The critical TE value was unaltered using two MR scanners of different field strengths. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{quantify}} {{and compare}} the intramyocellular (IMCL), extramyocellular (EMCL) lipids and total fat fraction in human vastus lateralis muscle between lean and type 2 diabetic (T 2 DM) subjects using long echo time (TE) STEAM proton MR spectroscopy (1 H-MRS). Methods : 1 H-MRS using single voxel (15 × 15 × 15 mm 3) stimulated acquisition mode (STEAM) was performed in right vastus lateralis m. on 10 lean controls (age: 28. 3 ± 3. 94 yo, BMI: 24. 25 ± 3. 20 kg/m 2) and 7 type 2 diabetic (age: 54. 28 ± 6. 42 yo, BMI: 31. 34 ± 3. 13 kg/m 2) subjects with Siemens 3 T MRI and a four-channel <b>flex</b> <b>coil.</b> Unsuppressed water spectra (NSA = 16) with TR/TE = 3000 / 30 ms, TM = 10 ms BW = 2000 Hz, and water-suppressed spectra (NSA = 128) with TR/TE = 3000 / 270 ms, TM = 10 ms, fixed water suppression BW = 50 Hz were acquired. Spectral intensity ratios of IMCL-CH 2, EMCL-CH 2 and total lipid (IMCL + EMCL) with unsuppressed water signal (W) were converted into absolute concentrations expressed in mmol/kg. Fat fraction (100 × F/(W+F)) was also calculated, where F includes the signal intensities of IMCL and EMCL methylene (CH 2) n, peaks only. Results: Comparison of IMCL (controls: 11. 70 ± 6. 7, T 2 DM: 21. 74 ± 10. 2, p < 0. 01), EMCL (controls: 22. 89 ± 18. 42, T 2 DM: 77. 21 ± 33. 4, p < 0. 001) and total lipid (64. 35 mmol/kg less in controls, p < 0. 001) showed statistical significance using two-tailed student’s t-test. Mean fat fraction (%) exhibited considerable inter-individual variability for controls (3. 14 ± 2. 09; range: 1. 34 – 7. 04) and T 2 DM (9. 34 ± 2. 88; range: 4. 15 – 13. 67) and deemed significant (p < 0. 05). Conclusion : Single voxel STEAM 1 H-MRS at long TE provides a robust non-invasive method for characterizing lipids within localized muscle regions, with well-resolved IMCL/EMCL peak separation. Regional lipid estimate and fat fraction in vastus lateralis muscle is significantly different in T 2 DM compared to normal lean controls.

40|$|The Göttingen Minipig (GM) is used {{as large}} animal model in {{articular}} cartilage research. The aim {{of the study was}} to introduce osteoarthritis (OA) in the GM by resecting the anterior cruciate ligament (ACLR) according to Pond and Nuki, verified by histological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scoring as well as analysis of gene and protein expression. The eight included skeletally mature female GM were assessed after ACLR in the left and a sham operation in the right knee, which served as control. 26 weeks after surgery the knee joints were scanned using a 3 -Tesla high-field MR tomography unit with a 3 T CP Large <b>Flex</b> <b>Coil.</b> Standard proton-density weighted fat saturated sequences in coronal and sagittal direction with a slice thickness of 3 mm were used. The MRI scans were assessed by two radiologists according to a modified WORMS-score, the X-rays of the knee joints by two evaluators. Osteochondral plugs with a diameter of 4 mm were taken for histological examination from either the main loading zone or the macroscopic most degenerated parts of the tibia plateau or condyle respectively. The histological sections were blinded and scored by three experts according to Little et al. Gene expression analysis was performed from surrounding cartilage. Expression of adamts 4, adamts 5, acan, col 1 A 1, col 2, il- 1 ß, mmp 1, mmp 3, mmp 13, vegf was determined by qRT-PCR. Immunohistochemical staining (IH) of Col I and II was performed. IH was scored using a 4 point grading (0 -no staining; 3 -intense staining). Similar signs of OA were evident both in ACLR and sham operated knee joints with the histological scoring result of the ACLR joints with 6. 48 ± 5. 67 points and the sham joints with 6. 86 ± 5. 84 points (p = 0. 7953) The MRI scoring yielded 0. 34 ± 0. 89 points for the ACLR and 0. 03 ± 0. 17 for the sham knee joints. There was no correlation between the histological and MRI scores (r = 0. 10021). The gene expression profiles as well as the immunohistochemical findings showed no significant differences between ACLR and sham knee joints. In conclusion, both knee joints showed histological signs of OA after 26 weeks irrespective of whether the ACL was resected or not. As MRI results did not match the histological findings, MRI was obviously unsuitable to diagnose the OA in GM. The analysis of the expression patterns of the 10 genes could not shed light on the question, whether sham operation also induced cartilage erosion or if the degeneration was spontaneous. The modified Pond-Nuki model may be used with reservation in the adult minipig to induce an isolated osteoarthritis...|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{demonstrate}} the design, fabrication and characterization of a synchronous micro motor. The micro motor consists of <b>flex</b> print <b>coils</b> and a permanent magnet rotor. The {{size of the}} motor is 2. 0 mm length and 1. 0 mm outer diameter. With 1. 0 A effective driving current, the motor can rotate a 0. 3 mm mirror at a maximum speed of 3640 revolutions per second. The uniformity and accuracy of the motor was characterized at 50 Hz, 200 Hz and 3200 Hz driving frequencies. The performance improved by increasing the driving frequency, which was represented as better speed uniformity and lower angular error. The torque of the motor {{was estimated to be}} 0. 25 - 0. 27 μN m with 1. 0 A current by fitting the measured speed based on the equation of motion. We describe the application of the micro motor as a distal actuator for intravascular imaging. We constructed optical and ultrasonic imaging catheters and show the intravascular images of coronary arteries obtained with these catheters...|$|R
25|$|One of the {{greatest}} operational problems with an evaporator is the build-up of scale. Its design is tailored to reduce this, and to make its cleaning as effective as possible. The usual design, as developed by Weir and the Admiralty, is for a vertical cylindrical drum, heated by steam-carrying drowned coils in the lower portion. As they are entirely submerged, they avoid the most active region for the deposition of scale, around the waterline. Each coil consists {{of one or two}} spirals in a flat plane. Each coil is easily removed for cleaning, being fastened by individual pipe unions through the side of the evaporator. A large door is also provided, allowing the coils to be removed or replaced. Cleaning may be carried out mechanically, with a manual scaling hammer. This also has a risk of mechanical damage to the tubes, as the slightest pitting tends to act as a nucleus for scale or corrosion. It is also common practice to break light scaling free by thermal shock, by passing steam through the coils without cooling water present or by heating the coils, then introducing cold seawater. In 1957 the trials ship , an obsolete heavy cruiser, was used for the first tests of the 'flexing element' distiller, where non-rigid heating <b>coils</b> <b>flexed</b> continually in service and so broke the scale free as soon as it formed a stiff layer.|$|R
