500|$|The 1990s {{brought a}} focus on greater {{independence}} for people with disabilities, and more inclusion in mainstream society [...] In schools, {{students with special needs}} were placed in regular classrooms rather than segregated settings, which led to an increased use of AAC as a means of improving student participation in class. Interventions became more collaborative and naturalistic, taking place in the classroom with the teacher, rather than <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>therapy</b> room. Facilitated communication – a method by which a facilitator physically and emotionally supports a person with severe communication needs as they type on a keyboard or letter board – received wide attention in the media and in the field. [...] The question of the authorship made the approach controversial; most of the subsequent research indicated that the facilitators were unknowingly influencing the messages typed. As a result, professional organizations and AAC researchers and clinicians have not typically accepted facilitated communication.|$|E

In this paper, we introduce two computational representations of range compensator. One of our compensator representations, which {{we refer to}} as a subtraction solid-based range compensator, precisely represents the compensator. Our other representation, the 3 D hexagon-based range compensator, closely approximates the compensator geometry.

50|$|Although the {{therapeutic}} effects of empathogens may be promising, {{drugs such as}} MDMA {{have the potential for}} negative effects that are counter productive <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>therapy</b> setting. For example, MDMA may make negative cognition worse. This means that a positive experience is not a guarantee and can be contingent on aspects like the setting and the patient's expectations. Additionally there is no clear model of the psychopharmalogical means for a positive or negative experience.  There is also a potential concern for the neurotoxic effects of MDMA on the fiber density of serotonin neurons in the neocortex. High doses of MDMA may cause potential depletion of serotonergic axons. The same effects may not be caused by lower doses of MDMA required for treatment, however.|$|E

5000|$|Motif Description, or the {{preferred}} term [...] "Motif Notation", {{is closely related}} to Labanotation in its use of the same family of symbols and terminology.

In contrast, Motif Notation highlights core elements and leitmotifs depicting the overall structure or essential elements of a movement sequence. It can be used to set a structure for dance improvisation or for an educational exploration of movement concepts.

5000|$|Neo-Marxist Feminist Therapy is {{a school}} of thought that {{believes}} that the means of knowledge, culture, and pedagogy {{are part of a}} privileged epistemology. In this school, privilege is meant to mean the absence of injustice and the resultant undue enrichment in terms of production of knowledge. Neo-marxist feminism relies heavily on critical theory, intersectional feminism and postmodern thought, and seeks to apply those theories in psychotherapy as the means of political and cultural change. Teresa Mcdowell and Rhea Almeda use these theories <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>therapy</b> method called [...] "liberation based healing", which like many forms of Marxism uses sample bias in the many interrelated liberties, in order to magnify the [...] "critical consciousness" [...] of the participants towards unrest of the status quo.|$|E

40|$|Background: Anxiety {{is one of}} the psychical {{stresses}} {{experienced by}} children during hospitalization. <b>A</b> storytelling <b>in</b> <b>a</b> play <b>therapy</b> is considered effective in reducing anxiety. Objective: This study aims to determine the effect of storytelling <b>in</b> <b>a</b> play <b>therapy</b> on anxiety level in pre-school children during hospitalization in the general hospital of Buton. Methods: This was a quasy-experimental study with pretest-posttest control group design. There were 30 pre-school children selected in this study using accidental sampling, with 15 assigned in each group. The Pre School - Spence Children’s Anxiety Scale (SCAS) was used to measure anxiety in pre-school children. Wilcoxon matched paired test was used to analyze the data. Results: Findings showed that the mean of anxiety level in the intervention group in pretest was 42 and in posttest was 31. 53. Wilcoxon matched paired test showed p-value 0. 003 (< 0. 05), which indicated that there was a statistically significant effect of storytelling on the level of anxiety in pre-school children. Conclusions: There is a significant influence of storytelling <b>in</b> <b>a</b> play <b>therapy</b> on anxiety levels in pre school children during hospitalization. It is suggested that this intervention could be applied as a nursing intervention to reduce anxiety in children. ...|$|R
