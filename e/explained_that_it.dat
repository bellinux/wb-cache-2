5|$|Thuppakkis {{first look}} poster was leaked on the {{internet}} on 30 April 2012, a day prior to its scheduled release on 1 May. The poster, that depicted Vijay holding a cigar in his mouth, was criticised by social activists for violating the Indian Tobacco Act, which prohibits advertising tobacco products. Murugadoss <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was only for promotional purposes and added that the film had no such scenes, claiming that even a small sequence featuring Vijay smoking had been deleted from the film.|$|E

5|$|An early {{concept for}} The Rite of Spring was {{to extend the}} story {{to the age of}} mammals and the first humans and the {{discovery}} of fire and man's triumph. John Hubley, the segment's art director, <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was later curtailed by Disney to avoid controversy from creationists, who promised to make trouble should he connect evolution with humans. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the history of the planet the studio received guidance from Roy Chapman Andrews, the director of the American Museum of Natural History, English biologist Julian Huxley, paleontologist Barnum Brown, and astronomer Edwin Hubble. Animators studied comets and nebulae at the Mount Wilson Observatory, and observed a herd of iguanas and a baby alligator that were brought into the studio. The camera was kept at a low position throughout the segment to heighten the immensity of the dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Graham, {{programmer}} of {{the original}} game, had returned to university after its completion, and David Darling, co-founder of Codemasters, decided {{that they could not}} wait for him to finish his degree. Codemasters approached Peter Williamson of Supersonic Software and had him produce the sequel. Williamson had just completed Cosmic Spacehead and wanted to do something new. It was intended for the sequel to reproduce the feeling {{of the original}} and add as many new features as possible. The original was used for reference, and the code and graphics were produced from the beginning. Williamson <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was hoped that they could capture and go beyond that the original game offered, and the game's success was anticipated. Darling wanted it {{to be more than a}} mere continuation of the first.|$|E
5|$|There were {{assertions that}} Odex had charged 10% {{interest}} for settlements paid through an instalment plan, but {{a press release}} by the company denied that it had required any such interest payments. By September 2007, 105 out of the 300 SingNet subscribers who had received letters had negotiated with and paid Odex, although, in a news conference, Odex said that it had neither forced payment from nor fined anyone. The company <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would not profit from the enforcement process and intended to donate to charity any excess amount received. It would also release a financial audit of all the money collected {{at the close of}} proceedings. On 31 August 2007, in an attempt to address criticisms of late releases, Odex began to offer video on demand (VOD) on its relaunched website. Users could legally download and unlock a digital rights management (DRM)-protected anime episode at S$2 for seven days.|$|E

5|$|Western Australia's Deputy Mineralogist gave {{evidence}} that he had identified magnesium hydroxide, a corrosion product, in fuel passages in one of Amana's engines. Counsel for the Department of Civil Aviation explained that evidence gathered during investigation of the crash indicated water {{in some of the}} fuel on board Amana was responsible for the corrosion products found in engines numbers 1 and 4; for the rough running of an engine heard by a number of witnesses; and for the intermittent failure of all engines, leading to the aircraft descending to ground level. The Inquiry heard evidence from the Department of Civil Aviation's Acting Chief Inspector of Air Accidents, C.A.J. Lum, a former RAAF Douglas Dakota pilot, who described his personal experience of a flight in 1946 in which all fuel tanks were checked for the presence of water prior to take-off and the flight proceeded normally for 20 minutes until both engines began running roughly. Lum returned to the aerodrome and checked again for water in the tanks, this time finding a significant amount of water. Counsel for the Vacuum Oil Co. <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was almost impossible for water to be introduced to an aircraft during refuelling, and vigorously rejected the theory that water in the fuel contributed to the crash.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{initially}} going to feature online elements, offered through Square's PlayOnline service. The features, however, were dropped during production, and online gaming would not {{become part of}} the Final Fantasy series until Final Fantasy XI. Map director Nakazato wanted to implement a world map concept with a more realistic approach than that of the traditional Final Fantasy game, in line with the realism of the game's 3D backgrounds, as opposed to pre-rendered backgrounds. As a player of the games in the Final Fantasy series, battle director Tsuchida wanted to recreate elements he found interesting or entertaining, which eventually led to the removal of the Active Time Battle system, and instead, incorporated the strategy-focused Conditional Turn-Based Battle system. Originally, Final Fantasy X was going to feature wandering enemies visible on the field map, seamless transitions into battles, and the option for players to move around the landscape during enemy encounters. Battle art director Shintaro Takai has <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was his intention that battles in Final Fantasy X come across as a natural part of the story and not an independent element. However, due to hardware limitations, this idea was not used. Instead, a compromise was made, whereby some transitions from the field map to the battle map were made relatively seamless with the implementation of a motion blur effect that would happen {{at the end of an}} event scene. The desire for seamless transitions also led to the implementation of the new summoning system seen in the game. Kitase has explained that the purpose behind the Sphere Grid is to give players an interactive means of increasing their characters' attributes, such that they will be able to observe the development of those attributes firsthand. The developers experienced difficulty with the scene of Tidus and Yuna kissing, as they were not used to animating romance scenes. Visual Works director Kazuyuki Ikumori stated that this was due to the use of 3D models in the scene. Because of the negative response from female members of staff, the scene was remade multiple times.|$|E

Bory de St.-Vincent knew Latreille's work, and managed to obtain the release of Latreille and one of his cell-mates. All the other inmates were dead within one month. The beetle had been described by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1775, but recognising it had saved Latreille's life.|$|E
