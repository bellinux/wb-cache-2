25|$|Waterboarding {{is a form}} {{of water}} torture in which water is poured over a cloth {{covering}} the face and breathing passages of an immobilized captive, causing the individual to experience the sensation of drowning. Ordinarily, the water is poured intermittently so as to prevent death during torture, however, if the water is poured uninterruptedly <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> death by asphyxia with the sensation of drowning, also called dry drowning. Besides death, waterboarding can cause extreme pain, damage to lungs, brain damage from oxygen deprivation, other physical injuries including broken bones due to struggling against restraints, and lasting psychological damage. Adverse physical consequences can manifest themselves months after the event, while psychological effects can last for years.|$|E

25|$|In 1991 David Deutsch {{showed that}} quantum theory is fully {{consistent}} (in {{the sense that}} the so-called density matrix can be made free of discontinuities) in spacetimes with closed timelike curves. However, later it was shown that such model of closed timelike curve can have internal inconsistencies as <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> strange phenomena like distinguishing non orthogonal quantum states and distinguishing proper and improper mixture. Accordingly, the destructive positive feedback loop of virtual particles circulating through a wormhole time machine, a result indicated by semi-classical calculations, is averted. A particle returning from the future does not return to its universe of origination but to a parallel universe. This suggests that a wormhole time machine with an exceedingly short time jump is a theoretical bridge between contemporaneous parallel universes.|$|E

Conservative groups in the U.S. have opposed the concept of making HPV vaccination mandatory for pre-adolescent girls, asserting that making the vaccine mandatory is a violation of parental rights. They also say that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> early sexual activity, giving a false sense of immunity to sexually transmitted disease. (See Peltzman effect) Both the Family Research Council and the group Focus on the Family support widespread (universal) availability of HPV vaccines but oppose mandatory HPV vaccinations for entry to public school. Parents also express confusion over recent mandates for entry to public school pointing out that HPV is transmitted through sexual contact, not through attending school with other children.|$|E

In 1763, the ambitious Emir Youssef Al Shihabi (ruled afterwards Mount Lebanon from 1770 to 1789) installed in the Jbeil region and being himself in conflict with the Hamadeh, profited from the difficulties of the Bourgeois Sheikhs and maneuvered to take from them the collection of taxes in Jebbet Bsharri. He contracted an alliance with the Bourgeois Sheikhs and confirmed their privileges in the tax collection of their districts as well as their right to claim the abandoned properties of the Hamadeh (Baklik). The fight with the Hamadeh will continue for 12 years. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> their eviction from the whole region and to their final defeat in 1772.

In the second game, he approaches Drake, convincing him to [...] help steal an oil lamp from a Turkish museum for a wealthy client. The two, along with Frazer, plan to keep the lamp for themselves, believing <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> the location of Marco Polo's lost fleet and the treasures it holds.

[...] There, Lazarevic and his men, Flynn, Drake and company are attacked by the Guardians, where Flynn is gravely wounded due to a gunshot wound from Lazarevic, his employer having clearly grown tired of his failures. Flynn ultimately commits suicide while attempting to blow up Drake but severely wounds Fisher with a grenade. Naughty Dog used the dialog in the game to hint at the relationship between Drake and Flynn, but desired ambiguity regarding the exact nature of their past dealings, and to show what Drake could have become. Flynn mainly served to hint at the darker past where Drake performed less heroic activities. Flynn was not written as a British character; the casting of a British actor was mere coincidence.|$|E
