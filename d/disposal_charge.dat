5000|$|In {{many places}} in Switzerland, {{household}} rubbish disposal and collection is charged for. Household refuse (except dangerous and cumbersome items, batteries, sofas, electrical appliances etc.) in theory, {{is only to}} be collected {{if it is in}} bags which either have a payment sticker attached, in official bags with the surcharge paid when the bags are purchased or weighed at central collection bins. However in practice, this is difficult to enforce, for hygiene reasons and difficulty in identifying the perpetrators. However it is a financial incentive to recycle as much as possible, for recycling is usually free of charge or cheaper, albeit not always operated through a door-to-door collection. Swiss health officials and police often open up garbage for which the <b>disposal</b> <b>charge</b> has not been paid. They search for evidence such as old bills which connect the bag to the household/person they originated from. Fines for not paying the disposal fee can now be up to CHF 10'000.- in some municipalities. Again many people are now aware of this and remove their names and details from any documentation disposed of illegally before trashing it, therefore rendering it impossible and futile for health officials to identify where the rubbish is coming from. In fact in some areas the cost of the payment stickers or official rubbish sacks has fallen slightly. However, where this has occurred, an annual taxation on refuse collection has been introduced or reintroduced as it were. In some extraordinary cases, a handful of municipalities have introduced refuse weighing machines and electronic chip-cards which need to be 'topped up' with money, thus enforcing payment for refuse elimination by weight and not volume. Again causing problems for elderly residents who would have to somehow get to the nearest refuse disposal point, possibly having to walk uphill or a significant distance. All such methods are proving unpopular Switzerland-wide, especially, as said, amongst the ageing Swiss nationals who often find it difficult {{to come to grips with}} the ever-imposing technological era. Dumping refuse and household waste inappropriately and/or illegally incurs a heavy fine.|$|E

40|$|A {{considerable}} amount of solid wastes is generated every year from construction and demolition (C&D) activities in Hong Kong. The C&D waste can be classified into inert and noninert wastes, in which the inert waste is normally disposed of in public fills as reclamation materials and the noninert waste is dumped at landfills. Under the current waste generation trend, all landfills and public fills in Hong Kong will be used up within a few years. To tackle this problem, in December of 2005, the Hong Kong Government implemented the Construction Waste Disposal Charging Scheme (CWDCS) to provide financial incentives to C&D waste generators to reduce waste and encourage reuse and recycling. This paper {{presents the results of}} a study to explore the perceptions of the Hong Kong construction participants toward the CWDCS after three years of implementation. The study was conducted by a survey with follow-up interviews to experienced professionals in the building industry. The results revealed no consensus view among the construction participants on C&D waste reduction, especially regarding on-site waste sorting and recycling. The findings also revealed that 40 % of the survey respondents believed that waste reduction is less than 5 % after CWDCS was implemented. The interviewees expressed that some waste generation was unavoidable, although a waste <b>disposal</b> <b>charge</b> has been imposed. In addition, 30 % of survey respondents agreed that the cost of CWDCS was not high enough to raise awareness about waste management on construction sites.

40|$|New Zealand has {{a problem}} with an {{increasing}} number of motor vehicles being abandoned {{at the end of their}} useful life. The environmental and associated social costs created by this problem are expected to increase with the rising number of vehicles entering the country. In addition, there are environmental concerns regarding some aspects of the legal disposal of end-of-life vehicles (ELVs). The exact magnitude of both problems is unknown and attempts made to address them have been ad hoc and success limited. This thesis sets out to quantify the problems and provide policy makers with tools to improve the overall management of motor vehicle disposal in New Zealand. To assess the extent and cost of the abandoned vehicle problem, local authorities are surveyed. The legislation dealing with car ownership, transferral and disposal and its implementation are scrutinised for weaknesses that allow ELVs to be abandoned without penalty. The automobile recycling industry is surveyed to determine the environmental impact from the industry's activities. Using semi-structured surveys, policies and practices used in other countries for the management of ELVs are investigated and assessed for effectiveness. Their application to the New Zealand situation is ascertained. Of the vehicles which are deregistered each year, one in five is dumped. The direct cost to local authorities, to deal with the 25, 500 vehicles abandoned each year, is more than six million dollars. In addition, practices and standards for the removal and disposal of hazardous substances from ELVs vary nationwide, adding to the environmental burden caused by vehicle disposal. Recommendations for the improved management of ELVs target four areas, legislation, institutional practices, entry into the recycling system and dismantling operations. Minor changes to legislation and institutional practices combined with rigorous enforcement will close the data gaps and overcome free-rider problems. A <b>disposal</b> <b>charge</b> added to the registration fee of vehicles entering the country will allow ELV owners to dispose of their vehicles free-of-charge. Improved environmental performance by automotive dismantlers can be achieved through licensing and consistent monitoring from within the industry. Implementation of these recommendations will lead to better management of ELVs, through changed behaviour by private individuals and dismantling operations, and a reduction in the environmental costs associated with vehicle disposal...|$|E
40|$|When {{speaking}} about energy it means {{speaking about}} life, activity, economy, growth and environmental issues. The issue of energy {{has been the}} main article {{all over the world}} in recent years, {{this is due to the}} importance of energy to life and its impact on the environment. For example, Paris climate change meeting in 2015 is one of the recent global meeting which directly related to the energy use by nations. The meeting was mainly focused up on the restriction of greenhouse gas emission which implies that industries should think about other alternative energy resources rather than fossil fuel for positive impact on climatic change. This is one of the cases that led industries into greater competition in the global market. Industries must consider energy alternatives which is safe for the environment and by using such energy a competitive product with better quality and quantity should be produced. This challenge has motivated industries to look and study the energy that they are using currently. Studies and researches show that one of the main and most abundant energy resources that most of these industries can get is by improving the energy efficiency or managing the energy that they currently use. The main aim of this thesis is to provide Arizona chemical plant (Kraton) at Sandarne on the potential energy saving by managing their energy use. The first wisdom in energy utilization is managing and using the energy they possess efficiently. In Arizona plant at Sandarne, the product named “Pitch” (a natural viscoelastic polymer or rosin) is a fuel used as the primary energy supply for the production of steam by boilers. The steam may be utilized well but the energy in the condensate (after steam loses its latent heat) is not addressed well enough. Hence this paper has studied on how significant is the energy lost by the steam condensate is and how its recovery can be used to save energy and cost. The plant produces about an average of 11. 42 ton of steam each hour in a year. This steam can be returned or fully recovered (100 %) as condensate from the law of conservation of mass since only energy is lost from the steam. But the plant returns a maximum of about 3 ton of condensate each hour. This amount is relatively low compared to the amount of condensate recovery possibility. Recovery possibility of condensate return showed that the plant at Sandarne can return at least 8. 5 ton of condensate  each hour. In comparison with the current return estimated 5. 5 ton of condensate is being lost simply as waste each hour leading to about 400 SEK minimum cost loss. The calculation of cost is in minimum because the charge from water supply and condensate effluent <b>disposal</b> <b>charge</b> are not considered. In this paper only recovery from the easily recoverable steam condensate is being considered (25 % of the system) which resulted in payback time of the proposed investment 1. 88 years without considering the above explained charges. It is much motivating study considering the generalized approach and over simplified method. If a deeper investigation is made on the potential, it can be clearly shown that how significant the potential is in securing and sustaining energy and environmental issues. Ensuring the security and sustainability of energy which addresses the environmental issue precisely will help the plant to stay on the race of global market competition.   Keywords: Energy efficiency, Boiler efficiency, Energy management, Condensate recovery...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, many {{companies}} are engaged in the heading of plasticizers molded in oil refineries, chemical industry, production of phenolic resins mainly generated byindustrial effluents with high concentrations of organic compounds, where they have great highlight the presence of phenolic substances. In the process of production of phenolic resins, exists as a product distilled {{in the presence of}} phenol at high concentrations (approximately 5 %), which is part of industrial wastewater effluent, with this part of the environmental problem that this paper proposes a industry a new technique for recovery, reuse and contribution to the environment. Its adverse effects submitted, the final destination of phenol in the environment and its removal is complicated and difficult by several factors: its high solubility in water at room temperature, its ability to ionize, low vapor pressure, its tendency to oxidation, to possess properties and characteristics of reactivity, stability and amphoteric (not biodegradable), can exist in the environment without losing its character under more drastic harmful, causing negative environmental impact. The proposed method offers new technology to recover the phenol is dissolved in industrial water through a chemical reaction with sodium hydroxide, to recover as sodium phenolate, which serves to reuse in the same process of the phenolic resin of novolac type. The secondary distillate from the distillation process of the sodium phenolate solution, even with traces of phenol was adsorbed completely through the bed of granular activated carbon, which guarantees the residual distillate without the presence of phenol for disposal or sewer outfall; contributing the same management and minimization of environmental impacts, particularly the aquatic environment. In the market there are several methodologies for the removal and wastewater treatment in the presence of phenol from the incineration, chemical degradation, biodegradation up heat, but still the resulting constraints are: phenol incineration of gaseous emissions (CO, CO 2, water vapor, etc [...] ) providing to the pollution of air quality and global warming of the planet earth, treatment of phenol biodegradation involves a need for space very large, low concentration of phenol and specialized bacteria are very sensitive to changing conditions, which is not in the treatment of phenolic industrial wastewater and chemical treatment for thermal degradation is very expensive, unlike the physicochemical and absorption method activated charcoal proposed is efficient, easy to use in the treatment of phenol, using input chemicals (NaOH and granular activated carbon) available on the market at low cost, making the method for the recovery of phenol in wastewater proposed industrial sector represents an alternative in the management and treatment of industrial water in order to preserve the aquatic environment mainly. We have developed a new technique physicochemical laboratorial y technique with an resultat eficient outcome, the proposed method has been shown to 96. 17 % recovery of phenol in industrial wastewater and the rest of phenol is treated with the technique of absorption granular activated carbon, which is demonstrated with a 100 % removal of phenol in industrial waste waters, it contributes to the field of science and industry to management, treatment and <b>disposal</b> <b>charge</b> compatible with the preservation and care of the environment, given that their industrial wastewater to the sewer may be available or surface water body (sea, river, lake, etc.), below the allowable limits, according to relevant industry standards, for example, for the Sub Sector Hydrocarbons must have industrial wastewater below the permissible limits, according to Article 1 of Supreme Decree N º 037 - 2008 -PCM "maximum permissible limits for liquid effluents to the Activities Sub-Sector Oil" to not impact the quality of surface waters in compliance of Supreme Decree N º 002 - 2008 -MINAM and Water Resources Act, it contributes to responsible environmental management, which minimizes the impact to aquatic ecosystems. The recovered phenol through the technique described above is broadly applicable in the same production process of phenolic resins. Phenol recovered can also be applied in the wood's conservation (manufacture of plywood, manufacture of pressed wood, iron, melanites, etc.). This research work in the management and treatment of phenol in industrial wastewater proposed, given other environmental tool to companies engaged in the business phenolic, so they can make use of this method in the management and treatment of these hazardous waste and avoid hiring firms EPS-RS for the management, treatment, transportation and disposal of such hazardous waste to a secure landfill, according to Supreme Decree 057 - 2004 -PCM. With this grant is contributing to environmental management that respects the environment, since it does not have the substance be toxic to aquatic ecosystems, which can negatively impact aquatic flora and fauna. To arrive at developing the experimental part, results from a literature search, mainly in journals or magazines for professionals and researchers, as well as communications made in conferences or symposiums, Doctoral thesis, etc. This research has allowed, among other things, support research that is desired to avoid undertaking research already carried out, to take cognizance of experiments already made to repeat them when necessary, further investigations interrupted or incomplete, seeking information suggestive, select a theoretical framework for the literature review. The undersigned concluyes that the research developed as the main objetive of this thesis is an efficient, economical and easy method for the application during the extraction and separation of phenol in industrial wastewater. It is a contribution to the environmentally responsible management and minimization of hazardous substances that can negatively impact the environment and, finally, is an environmental management tool for industry to manage and minimize environmental impacts. En la actualidad, muchas empresas están dedicadas al rubro de plastificantes moldeables, en las refinerías de petróleo, en la industria de química, en la producción de resinas fenólicas principalmente, que generan efluentes residuales industriales con altas concentraciones de compuestos orgánicos, en donde tienen gran destaque la presencia de sustancias fenólicas. En el proceso de producción de resinas fenólicas, existe como subproducto un destilado con presencia de fenol en altas concentraciones (aproximadamente 5 %), que forma parte del efluente residual industrial, siendo esta parte del problema ambiental, que el presente trabajo de investigación propone a la industria una nueva técnica de recuperación, reuso y aporte al ambiente. Sus efectos adversos presentados, el destino final del fenol en el ambiente y su remoción es complicado y difícil por diversos factores: su alta solubilidad en el agua a temperatura ambiente, su habilidad para ionizarse, su baja presión de vapor, su tendencia a la oxidación, por poseer propiedades y características de reactividad, estabilidad y anfotérico (no biodegradable), puede existir en el ambiente sin perder su carácter nocivo en condiciones más drásticas, causando impacto negativo al medio ambiente. El método propuesto propone una nueva tecnología que consiste en recuperar el fenol disuelto en agua industrial a través de una reacción química con hidróxido de sodio, para recuperar como fenolato de sodio, que sirve para reusar en el mismo proceso de la resina fenólica del tipo las novolacas. El destilado secundario del proceso de destilación de la solución fenolato de sodio, aún con trazas de fenol es adsorbido totalmente a través del lecho de carbón activado granulado, que garantiza el destilado residual sin presencia de fenol para su disposición final al alcantarillado o emisor submarino; la misma que contribuye el manejo y minimización de impacto al medio ambiente, en especial al medio acuático. En el mercado existen varios metodologías para la remoción y tratamiento de aguas residuales con presencia de fenol desde la incineración, biodegradación hasta degradación química térmica, siendo los limitantes más resultantes tenemos: la incineración de fenol genera emisiones gaseosas (CO, CO 2, vapor de agua, etc.) que aporta a la contaminación de la calidad de aire y al calentamiento global de la planeta tierra; tratamiento de fenol por biodegradación involucra necesidad de contar con un espacio muy grande, con baja concentración de fenol y bacterias pecializadas muy sensibles al cambio de condiciones, que no es aplicable en el tratamiento de aguas residuales industriales con fenol; y el tratamiento por degradación química térmica es muy costoso, a diferencia del método fisicoquímico y absorción con carbón activado propuesto, es eficiente, fácil manejo en el tratamiento de fenol, uso de insumo químico comercial (NaOH y carbón activado granulado) a disposición en el mercado con un costo bajo, haciendo que el método para la recuperación de fenol en aguas residuales industriales propuesto represente al sector industrial una alternativa en el manejo y tratamiento de dicho agua industrial con la finalidad de preservar el ambiente acuático principalmente. Se ha desarrollado una nueva técnica fisicoquímica a nivel de laboratorio con resultado eficiente, es decir, con el método propuesto se ha demostrado la recuperación al 96. 17 % de fenol en aguas residuales industriales y, el resto de fenol es tratado con la técnica de absorción con carbón activado granulado, con el cual se demuestra una remoción del 100 % de fenol en aguas industriales, la misma que contribuye al campo científico y al sector industrial a un manejo, tratamiento y disposición final responsable compatible con la preservación y cuidado al medio ambiente, toda vez que sus aguas residuales industriales se puede disponer al alcantarillado o al cuerpo de agua superficial (mar, río, laguna, etc.), por debajo de los límites permitidos, según las normas del sector correspondiente; por ejemplo, para el Sub Sector Hidrocarburos, hay que disponer las aguas residuales industriales por debajo de los límites permisibles, de acuerdo al Art. 1 º del Decreto Supremo Nº 037 - 2008 -PCM “Límites Máximos Permisibles de Efluentes Líquidos para las Actividades del Sub-Sector Hidrocarburos”, a fin de no impactar la calidad de aguas superficiales, en cumplimiento del Decreto Supremo Nº 002 - 2008 -MINAM y la Ley de Recursos Hídricos, la misma que contribuye a un manejo ambiental responsable, que minimiza el impacto al ecosistema acuático. El fenol recuperado a través de la técnica descrito en líneas arriba tiene aplicación en el mismo proceso de producción de resinas fenólicas. También el fenol recuperado puede tener aplicación en el tratamiento de maderas (fabricación de triplay, fabricación de madera prensado, planchas, melanitas, etc.) como preservativos. Con el presente trabajo de investigación en el manejo y tratamiento de fenol en aguas residuales industriales se propone otra herramienta ambiental a las empresas dedicadas en el rubro fenólicas, para que pueden hacer uso de este método en el manejo y tratamiento de estos residuos peligrosos y así evitar contratar empresas EPS-RS para el manejo, tratamiento, transporte y disposición final de dicho residuo peligroso a un relleno de seguridad, de acuerdo al Decreto Supremo N° 057 - 2004 -PCM. Con este aporte se está contribuyendo al manejo ambiental responsable con el medio ambiente, toda vez que no se va disponer la sustancia toxica al ecosistema acuático, que puede impactar negativamente a la flora y fauna acuática. Para llegar a desarrollar la parte experimental, se ha realizado una investigación bibliográfica, fundamentalmente en journals o revistas destinadas a profesionales e investigadores, como así también las comunicaciones hechas en Congresos o Simposios, tesis de doctorado, etc. Esta indagación ha permitido, entre otras cosas, apoyar la investigación que se desea realizar, evitar emprender investigaciones ya realizadas, tomar conocimiento de experimentos ya hechos para repetirlos cuando sea necesario, continuar investigaciones interrumpidas o incompletas, buscar información sugerente, seleccionar un marco teórico para el estudio bibliográfico. El suscrito concluye que el trabajo de investigación desarrollado que es materia de esta tesis, es un eficiente, económico y método fácil en la aplicación en la extracción y separación de fenol en aguas residuales industriales.

40|$|Due to {{the rising}} {{worldwide}} awareness of green environment, both government and contractors have to consider effective construction and demolition (C&D) waste management practices. The last two decades have witnessed the growing importance of demolition and renovation (D&R) works and the growing amount of D&R waste disposed to landfills every day, especially in developed cities like Hong Kong. Quantitative waste prediction is crucial for waste management. It can enable contractors to pinpoint critical waste generation processes and to plan waste control strategies. In addition, waste estimation could also facilitate some government waste management policies, such as the waste <b>disposal</b> <b>charging</b> scheme in Hong Kong. Currently, tools that can accurately and conveniently estimate {{the amount of waste}} from construction, renovation, and demolition projects are lacking. In the light of this research gap, this paper presents a building information modeling (BIM) based system that we have developed for estimation and planning of D&R waste. BIM allows multi-disciplinary information to be superimposed within one digital building model. Our system can extract material and volume information through the BIM model and integrate the information for detailed waste estimation and planning. Waste recycling and reuse are also considered in our system. Extracted material information can be provided to recyclers before demolition or renovation to make recycling stage more cooperative and more efficient. Pick-up truck requirements and waste <b>disposal</b> <b>charging</b> fee for different waste facilities will also be predicted through our system. The results could provide alerts to contractors ahead of time at project planning stage. This paper also presents an example scenario with a 47 -floor residential building in Hong Kong to demonstrate our D&R waste estimation and planning system. As the BIM technology has been increasingly adopted in the architectural, engineering and construction industry and digital building information models will likely to be available for most buildings (including historical buildings) in the future, our system can be used in various demolition and renovation projects and be extended to facilitate project control.

Consequently, it has created a serious waste management problem. The State Governments of Victoria and New South Wales have been pushing {{for the use of}} recycled materials; they have promulgated specifications for the use of recycled aggregate from construction and related waste. However, in Queensland, similar specifications are not available, which explains the lack of research conducted in this important area. This paper presents an evaluation of the prevailing waste recycling methods used in Queensland. Nine sites have been visited, including two construction sites, three demolition sites, three recycling plants and one landfill in Southeast Queensland. Difficulties encountered by the recycling operators and their associates from these site visits are investigated. One of the major barriers is that the local councils disallow the use of recycled materials in construction activities! To help improve the situations, state and local authorities should implement policies encourage the use of recycled construction waste.

The study demonstrates the capability of these schemes to significantly reduce household waste and suggests changes to allow their possible adoption in England. One of the main barriers to their adoption is the Environmental Protection Act, 1990 that prevents English local authorities (LAs) from implementing the variable charging method for household waste management. This barrier could be removed through a change in legislation. The need to derive consistent data and standardise the method of measuring the effectiveness of schemes is also highlighted...|$|R

40|$|The Productivity Commission�s {{inquiry report}} into �Waste Management� was {{released}} in December 2006. The Australian Government asked the Commission to identify policies that would enable Australia to address market failures and externalities associated with the generation and disposal of waste, and recommend how resource efficiencies can be optimised to improve economic, environmental and social outcomes. In the final report, the Commission maintains that waste management policy should be refocused on the environmental and social impacts of waste collection and disposal. The Commission noted that policy makers and community attitudes {{will need to be}} guided by more open and rigorous analysis of costs, benefits and risks, if waste management measures are to best serve the community. The Commission also recommends that the Australian Government play a leadership role in facilitating relevant reforms and in developing sound, nationally consistent waste management policies. The Commission makes further recommendations in several other areas including target setting, landfill regulation, <b>disposal</b> <b>charges</b> and levies, product stewardship, government procurement and performance indicators. The Commission�s findings and recommendations are categorised under the following headings: waste management in Australia; {{the costs and benefits of}} waste; the case for government intervention; a waste policy framework; the waste hierarchy and target setting; regulation; market-based instruments; extended producer responsibility and product stewardship; Government information provision and procurement; institutional and regulatory impediments to resource recovery; and performance measurement.

50|$|Nevada, Washington, and South Carolina {{threatened}} {{to close their}} sites unless Congress acted to give them greater control. To relieve this problem {{and at the same}} time to accelerate action, Congress passed the Low Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-240). The Low Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act (LLRWPAA) extended the operation of the three existing disposal sites to December 31, 1992. After that time the three sites could close or exclude waste from outside the compacts in which they were located. The Amendments Act also set up strong incentives to encourage states without sites for disposal facilities to site, license, and construct facilities. Compacts and states without sites when the 1985 Amendments Act was passed faced rising <b>disposal</b> <b>charges</b> for using existing disposal facilities. They also had to meet specific milestones in order to maintain access to the present facilities. Milestones included deadlines on ratifying compacts, selecting host states, developing plans, submitting license applications, and providing disposal. Existing disposal sites are allowed to impose surcharges for disposal of wastes from regions without sites, with rebates to be used by states or compacts for site development. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) keeps track of these arrangements, with authority to assign additional emergency disposal capacity to reactors, while the NRC can authorize emergency access to existing sites. Both agencies are active in providing information and guidance.|$|R

40|$|Based on the {{polluter}} pays principle, {{construction waste}} <b>disposal</b> <b>charging</b> schemes (CWDCS) {{have been deployed}} by various economies {{as one of the}} most effective ways of managing construction waste. Nevertheless, a means of rationalizing these schemes has not been well documented. Using the economic technique of contingent valuation method (CVM), this study aims to investigate stakeholders’ willingness to pay (WTP) for enhanced construction waste management (CWM) with a view to providing a scientific foundation for CWDCS rationalization. In considering this WTP in light of repeated exhortations that all stakeholders play a role in the management of construction waste, the study is unique. To ascertain stakeholders’ WTP, a payment card-style questionnaire survey was designed and administered to Hong Kong’s major CWM stakeholders in February 2014. Interestingly, the results show that there is no statistically significant variation in the WTP of different stakeholder groups. The average maximum WTP is around HK$ 232 /t for landfill disposal of C&D waste, HK$ 186 /t for off-site sorting facility (OSF) disposal, and HK$ 120 /t for public fill reception facility (PFRF) disposal. These values are higher than the existing CWDCS charges (HK$ 125 /t for landfilling, HK$ 100 /t for OSF disposal, and HK$ 27 /t for PFRF disposal) but much lower than the charges proposed to the government. This research provides not only a scientific foundation for the ongoing debate on changes to Hong Kong’s CWDCS, but also a valuable reference for other economies facing the challenge of developing charging schemes to deal with construction waste. postprin...|$|R
40|$|Waste {{management}} in the building industry in Hong Kong has become an important environmental issue. Particularly, an increasing amount of construction and demolition (C&D) waste is being disposed at landfill sites. In order to reduce waste generation and encourage reuse and recycling, the Hong Kong Government has implemented the Construction Waste <b>Disposal</b> <b>Charging</b> Scheme (CWDCS) to levy charges on C&D waste disposal to landfills. In order to provide information on the changes in reducing waste generation practice among construction participants in various work trades, a study was conducted after 3 years of implementation of the CWDCS via a structured questionnaire survey in the building industry in Hong Kong. The study result has revealed changes with work flows of the major trades as well as differentiating the levels of waste reduced. Three building projects in {{the public and private}} sectors were selected as case studies to demonstrate the changes in work flows and the reduction of waste achieved. The research findings reveal that a significant reduction of construction waste was achieved at the first 3 years (2006 – 2008) of CWDCS implementation. However, the reduction cannot be sustained. The major trades have been influenced to a certain extent by the implementation of the CWDCS. Slight improvement in waste management practices was observed, but reduction of construction waste in the wet-finishing and dry-finishing trades has undergone little improvement. Implementation of the CWDCS has not yet motivated subcontractors to change their methods of construction so as to reduce C&D waste.

5000|$|US {{state laws}} and {{regulations}} dealing with scrap tires are currently enacted in 48 states. Here are some common features of state programs that deal with scrap tires: source of funding for the program; licensing or registration of scrap tire haulers, processors, and end users; manifests for scrap tire shipments; limitations on who may handle scrap tires; financial assurance requirements for scrap tire handlers; and market development activities. [...] Some state programs are now supported by fees charged to the consumer at purchase or disposal of each tire. These fees, sometimes called “tipping fees”, help to support recycling costs. When the <b>disposal</b> rates <b>charged</b> to consumers are set high, this, in turn, discourages landfill disposal, a simple solution encouraging more affordable tire recycling programs.|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} a {{difficult}} task to reduce and handle solid wastes generated from construction and demolition (C&D) activities {{in a number of}} countries. In Hong Kong, the C&D soHd wastes of which many of them are suitable for recycling land reclamation were typically disposed to landfills. Regarding this, in December 2005, a main piece of legislation regarding the C&D solid waste minimization namely the Construction Waste <b>Disposal</b> <b>Charging</b> Scheme (CWDCS) was enacted in Hong Kong. Since then disposal of C&D solid waste to public landfill sites has no longer been a &# 039;free meal&# 039; for the contractors. While the government statistics indicate that the average quantity of C&D solid waste disposed to the public landfill has been tremendously decreased, disgraceful news about the illegal disposal of C&D waste by contractors have begun to mount. Some criticized that the illegal disposal was indeed driven by the legislation. It is because the legislation itself basically cannot solve the problems encountered by the contractors i. e. an effective solid waste reduction and management. As such, a behavioral change of solid waste disposal by the contractors has yet been noted. This study uses the enactment of the CWCS as a benchmark, and seeks to investigate [I] whether the Scheme has prompted the construction contractors to adopt C&D solid wastes reduction strategies in the construction projects; and [2] the effect of the strategy applied by the contractors on C&D solid waste reduction in their projects. A questionnaire survey was conducted. The analysed results based on the Pearson correlation analysis show that the enactment of the CWCS merely led the main contractors reorient their operational practices. Collaboration among project team members in C&D solid waste reduction remains inadequate. Recommendation in response to the research findings was suggested...|$|R
