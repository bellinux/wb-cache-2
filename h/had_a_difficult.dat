5|$|Andersen {{was born}} on 9 July 1898 in Kristiania (now Oslo), and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> childhood, {{the latter part of}} it in an orphanage. He was the son of {{construction}} worker Ole Andersen and Josefine Hansen. Soon after Johannes was born, Norway entered a period of economic difficulties, with little construction work available. This led to his father having to change jobs from mason to milkman. Johannes' mother became obsessed with religion.|$|E
5|$|Andretti {{found little}} success after 1978 in Formula One– {{he failed to}} win another grand prix. He <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> year in 1979, as the new Lotus 80 was not competitive, and the team {{had to rely on}} the Lotus 79 which had been {{overtaken}} by the second generation of ground effect cars. In 1980, he was paired with the young Italian Elio de Angelis, and briefly with test driver Nigel Mansell, but the team was again unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|During the war, Japan brought {{as many as}} 670,000 Korean conscripts to Japan to work as forced labor. About 5,000–8,000 Koreans {{were killed}} in Hiroshima and another 1,500–2,000 died in Nagasaki. For many years, Korean {{survivors}} <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> time fighting for the same recognition as Hibakusha as afforded to all Japanese survivors, a situation {{which resulted in the}} denial of the free health benefits to them. Most issues were eventually addressed in 2008 through lawsuits.|$|E
5|$|Henry III's younger brother, Richard of Cornwall, {{was granted}} the earldom in 1227. Backed by the {{revenues}} from the lucrative Cornish tin mining industry, he reconstructed the defences at the castle. Richard only visited Cornwall occasionally during his life, probably using Berkhampsted and Wallingford castles as his primary residences in England, and the work may {{have been designed to}} impress the Cornish nobility, with whom Richard <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> relationship.|$|E
5|$|Neild's family {{arrived in}} Australia in 1860, {{and he worked}} as an {{insurance}} agent and company manager before winning election to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1885. He served intermittently until 1901 and had a tumultuous career as a backbencher, eventually contributing significantly to {{the fall of the}} Reid government in 1899. He also established his own volunteer regiment, which <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> and sometimes hostile relationship with military command.|$|E

His older sister, Sigrún Hjálmtýsdóttir (Diddú), is an opera singer.|$|E
5|$|Sorabji {{appears to}} have <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> {{relationship}} with his father. Although the father was musically cultured and financed the publication of several of Sorabji's compositions (enabling 14 {{of them to be}} published between 1921 and 1931), he did not want his son to become a musician. He is also alleged to have brought about the end of his wife's singing career.|$|E
5|$|When Marseille {{was still}} a young child his parents {{divorced}} and his mother subsequently married a police official named Reuter. Marseille initially assumed {{the name of his}} stepfather at school (a matter he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> time accepting) but he reverted to his father's name of Marseille in adulthood. He acquired the reputation of being a rebel from a lack of discipline, a characteristic that plagued him early on in his Luftwaffe career. Marseille also <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> relationship with his natural father whom he refused to visit in Hamburg for some time after the divorce. Eventually he attempted a reconciliation with his father, who subsequently introduced him to the nightlife that was to initially hamper his military career during his early years in the Luftwaffe. However, the rapproachment with his father did not last and he did not see him again thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Also in 1933 Whale {{directed}} the romantic comedy By Candlelight which gained good reviews {{and was a}} modest box office hit. In 1934 he directed One More River, an adaptation of the novel {{of the same name}} by John Galsworthy. The film {{tells the story of a}} woman desperate to escape her abusive marriage to a member of the British aristocracy. This was the first of Whale's films for which Production Code Administration approval was required and Universal <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> time securing that approval because of the elements of sexual sadism implicit in the husband's abusive behavior.|$|E
5|$|Although the Giants {{had one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} seasons in franchise history in 1990, the season <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> beginning as Taylor held out of training camp, demanding a new contract with a salary of $2 million per year. Talks reached September with no progress. As the season approached Taylor received $2,500 dollars a day in fines for not reporting. Taylor signed a contract just four days before the season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles. Despite barely practicing since the previous season, he started and finished with three sacks and a forced fumble.|$|E
5|$|Dougan {{returned}} to the First Division when he signed for Leicester City in May 1965 for a £26,000 fee. However, he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> relationship with manager Matt Gillies despite being the first choice striker at Filbert Street. He scored 19 goals in 37 league games in the 1965–66 season to help the team to a seventh-place finish. He scored 21 goals in 35 league and cup games in the 1966–67 season, but his 'free spirit' nature frustrated Gillies, who sanctioned Dougan's sale despite his good form.|$|E

5|$|Fingleton <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> childhood, {{forced to}} leave formal {{education}} {{at the age of}} 12 to support his family {{after the death of his}} father. He worked in a series of odd jobs before joining the media at the age of 15. He gradually progressed in his newspaper and cricket career. After making his first-grade debut in Sydney district cricket at the age of 16, he made his first-class debut for New South Wales at the age of 20 in 1928–29. However, Fingleton struggled to establish himself at interstate level, and was unable to maintain a regular position in the team, playing in only seven matches in his first three seasons.|$|E
5|$|He was {{inducted}} into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1975. Russell, who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> relationship with the media, did not attend either event. After retiring as a player, Russell had stints as head coach of the Seattle SuperSonics (1973 to 1977) and Sacramento Kings (1987 to 1988). His time as a non-player coach was lackluster; although he led the struggling SuperSonics into the playoffs {{for the first time in}} franchise history, Russell's defensive, team-oriented Celtics mindset did not mesh well with the team, and he left in 1977 with a 162–166 record. Russell's stint with the Kings was considerably shorter, his last assignment ending when the Kings went 17–41 to begin the 1987–88 season.|$|E
5|$|Jænberht (died 792) was {{a medieval}} monk, {{and later the}} abbot, of St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury who was named Archbishop of Canterbury in 765. As archbishop, he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> {{relationship}} with King Offa of Mercia, who at one point confiscated lands from the archbishopric. By 787, some of the bishoprics under Canterbury's supervision were transferred to {{the control of the}} newly created Archbishopric of Lichfield, although it is not clear if Jænberht ever recognised its legitimacy. Besides the issue with Lichfield, Jænberht also presided over church councils in England. He died in 792 and was considered a saint after his death.|$|E

5|$|Kennedy {{was spotted}} by Arsenal playing for New Hartley Juniors, {{and though the}} scouts had {{initially}} gone to the game to watch his striker partner Watts, Kennedy had impressed enough to win an apprentice contract with Arsenal in May 1968. He then signed professional forms with the club in November 1968. He <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> task though to win a first team place, as manager Bertie Mee used only 15 players throughout the entire 1968–69 season, during which time Kennedy made 20 appearances for the Reserve team as they claimed the Football Combination Division One title.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall {{was born}} at Mascot, Sydney, New South Wales, the fourth of five children. He had one younger sister, two older sisters {{one of which was}} Eileen Lindwall who married Frank Weston and an older brother. The {{grandson}} of Swedish and Irish immigrants, Lindwall <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> childhood with his mother Catherine dying of pneumonia when he was seven. His father Arthur had a job at the Water and Sewerage Board, but the children were aware that their father could not financially support them beyond school-leaving age.|$|E
5|$|Lord Hailsham {{left his}} {{position}} in 1938 due to his failing health, {{and was replaced by}} Lord Maugham, who was appointed on 15 March. His appointment was done on Schuster's advice and was considered quite a surprise as he had no real political experience; even Maugham himself admitted he had not expected to be offered the job. Schuster and Maugham <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> relationship, especially after the start of the Second World War in 1939, due to their differing political opinions. Schuster did not play an active part in policy decisions in this period, partially because of his disagreements with Maugham and partially because Maugham preferred to work on legislation and policy changes himself. Schuster later said that he got on with all of his Lord Chancellors except one—Maugham.|$|E
