5|$|Black's view on {{due process}} drew from his reading of British history; to him, due process meant all persons {{were to be}} tried in {{accordance}} with the Bill of Rights' procedural guarantees and in accordance with constitutionally pursuant laws. Black advocated <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> by the government for all persons, regardless of wealth, age, or race. Black's view of due process was restrictive {{in the sense that it}} was premised on equal procedures; it did not extend to substantive due process. This was in accordance with Black's literalist views. Black did not tie procedural due process exclusively to the Bill of Rights, but he did tie it exclusively to the Bill of Rights combined with other explicit provisions of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|For most of Scott's {{tenure as}} governor, {{tensions}} between the U.S. and Great Britain escalated. Sentiment {{in favor of a}} U.S. declaration of war against the British was particularly strong in Kentucky. Most Kentuckians resented the replacement of the Embargo Act of 1807 with the weaker Non-Intercourse Act of 1809 and Macon's Bill Number 2. Kentucky Senator Henry Clay became the acknowledged leader of the war hawks in Congress. During an address to the General Assembly on December 4, 1810, Scott expressed little hope of peacefully resolving U.S. grievances against Great Britain. He reminded the General Assembly, however, that France had also violated the United States' maritime rights and urged <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> of the two countries for their offenses.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} these steps toward <b>equal</b> <b>treatment,</b> a legal flaw remained: if {{children}} were born within a lesbian marriage, the non-biological mother was not legally regarded as a parent; she still had to undergo the lengthy financial process of adoption. This right was granted to heterosexual couples (married or not), where a stepfather could declare his wife's children to be his without further process. On 7 November 2006, the Spanish Parliament amended the law on assisted reproduction, allowing the non-biological mother {{to be regarded as}} a parent alongside her female spouse who is the birth-mother.|$|E

40|$|To {{avoid the}} {{cumulative}} application of takeover regulation of more jurisdictions, {{it is common}} practice to exclude from the offer shareholders resident in countries adopting extraterritorial conflict rules. Among such countries, the most significant case is that of US securities regulation: according to US case-law, {{in order to avoid}} the application of US takeover regulation and anti-fraud provisions, bidders should completely exclude any publicity of the offer in the US or to US resident and consider acceptances from US residents as void. However, such restrictions could be at odds with the principle of <b>equal</b> <b>treatments</b> of targetâ€™s shareholders, provided for by the EU Takeover Directive. In the paper, I argue that only restrictions to dissemination could be reconciled with the equality principle.

5|$|The {{massacre}} and Gandhi's non-violent {{response to}} it moved many, but also made some Sikhs and Hindus upset that Dyer was getting away with murder. Investigation committees were formed by the British, which Gandhi asked Indians to boycott. The unfolding events, the massacre and the British response, led Gandhi {{to the belief that}} Indians will never get a fair <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> under British rulers, and he shifted his attention to Swaraj or self rule and political independence for India. In 1921, Gandhi was the leader of the Indian National Congress. He reorganised the Congress. With Congress now behind him, and Muslim support triggered by his backing the Khilafat movement to restore the Caliph in Turkey, Gandhi had the political support and the attention of the British Raj.|$|E
5|$|Boganda {{was born}} into a family of {{subsistence}} farmers, and was adopted and educated by Roman Catholic Church missionaries. In 1938, he was ordained as the first Roman Catholic priest from Oubangui-Chari. During World War II, Boganda served in a number of missions and after was persuaded by the Bishop of Bangui to enter politics. In 1946, he became the first Oubanguian elected to the French National Assembly, where he maintained a political platform against racism and the colonial regime. He then returned to Oubangui-Chari to form a grassroots movement in opposition of French colonialism. The movement led to the 1949 foundation of the Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa (MESAN), which became popular among villagers and the working class. Boganda's reputation was slightly damaged when he was laicized from the priesthood after marrying Michelle Jourdain, a parliamentary secretary. Nonetheless, he continued to advocate for <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> and civil rights for blacks in the territory well into the 1950s.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} different irrigation levels on yield and oil content of rapeseed, and to determine the irrigation requirement and irrigation scheduling, an experiment with Randomized Complete Block Design consisting of four irrigation treatments replicated 3 times, was conducted in Zarghan Agric. Expt. Station {{during the years of}} 2000 - 2003. The treatments were based on the cumulative evaporation values of 50, 75, 100 and 125 mm from class A pan (T 50, T 75, T 100 and T 125). The depth of water for each treatment was determined according to the deficit of field capacity and soil moisture content before irrigation. In the three years of experiment, the cultivars: Okapi, Orient and Likord were cultivated and the annual data related to yield and seed oil contents of each cultivar was analyzed separately. In the first year of experiment, the effect of different treatments on yield of Okapi cultivar was not significant, but the maximum and minimum yields were obtained at the T 75 and T 100 <b>treatments</b> <b>equal</b> to 2678 and 2050 kg ha- 1, respectively. The effect of different treatments on seed oil content was significant at the level of 5 %, and the maximum and minimum seed oil contents were obtained at the T 100 and T 75 <b>treatments</b> <b>equal</b> to 42. 50 and 41. 66 %, respectively. In the second year of experiment, the effect of different treatments on the yield of Orient cultivar was significant at the level of 5 %, and the maximum and minimum yields were obtained at the T 50 and T 125 <b>treatments</b> <b>equal</b> to 3133 and 2133 kg ha- 1, respectively. The effect of different treatments on seed oil content was significant at the level of 5 %, and the maximum and minimum seed oil contents were obtained at the T 75 and T 50 <b>treatments</b> <b>equal</b> to 46. 38 and 44. 82 %, respectively. In the third year of experiment, the effect of different treatments on the yield of Likord cultivar was significant at the level of 5 %, and the maximum and minimum yields were obtained at the T 50 and T 125 <b>treatments</b> <b>equal</b> to 3667 and 2250 kg ha- 1, respectively. The effect of different treatments on seed oil content was significant at the level of 1 %, and the maximum and minimum seed oil contents were obtained at the T 50 and T 125 <b>treatments</b> <b>equal</b> to 47. 63 and 44. 60 %, respectively.

5|$|In 1873, Melvin {{refused to}} {{transfer}} the case of Taylor Strauder, a black man, to a federal court following his indictment by an all-white Ohio County grand jury {{for the murder of}} his wife. Strauder and his lawyers argued that he would not receive <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> in the West Virginia courts due to its all-white jury law and cited the Civil Rights Act of 1866 for a transfer to a federal court. Following Melvin's ruling, Strauder's murder trial proceeded in the Ohio County court in May 1873, and he was inevitably convicted by an all-white jury. Strauder appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia and finally to the Supreme Court of the United States, where his case Strauder v. West Virginia 100 U.S. 303 (1879) was decided on March1, 1880. The Supreme Court held that categorical exclusion of blacks from juries {{for no other reason than}} their race violated the Equal Protection Clause, and Strauder's conviction was overturned due to the Ohio County court's violation of United States constitutional criminal procedure.|$|E
5|$|The Right to Equality {{is one of}} {{the chief}} {{guarantees}} of the Constitution. It is embodied in Articles 14â€“16, which collectively encompass the general principles of equality before law and non-discrimination, and Articles 17â€“18 which collectively encompass further the philosophy of social equality. Article 14 guarantees equality before law as well as equal protection of the law to all persons within the territory of India. This includes the equal subjection of all persons to the authority of law, as well as <b>equal</b> <b>treatment</b> of persons in similar circumstances. The latter permits the State to classify persons for legitimate purposes, provided there is a reasonable basis for the same, meaning that the classification is required to be non-arbitrary, based on a method of intelligible differentiation among those sought to be classified, as well as have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the classification.|$|E
