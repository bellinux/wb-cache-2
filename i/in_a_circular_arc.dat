The length of the path that it traces is called the measurement length. The wavelength of the lowest frequency filter that will be used to analyze the data is usually defined as the sampling length.

The assessment length or evaluation length is the length of data that will be used for analysis. Commonly one sampling length is discarded from each end of the measurement length. 3D measurements can be made with a profilometer by scanning over a 2D area on the surface.|$|E

The Inland Empire Highway was numbered as State Road 3 in 1923 and PSH 3 in 1937 as part of the primary and secondary state highways. The United States Highway System was adopted on November 11, 1926 by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) and included US 295, traveling northeast from US 410 at Dodge to US 195 in Colfax and crossing the Snake River at Central Ferry. US 295 succeeded PSH 3 during the 1964 state highway renumbering, but was decommissioned in 1968 before the new state highway system was codified. The roadway was re-designated as SR 127 after the new sign route number system was codified into the Revised Code of Washington in 1970, traveling 43.82 mi from US 12 at Dodge to US 195 in Colfax and crossing the Snake River on the Elmer Huntley Bridge, completed in 1969.

5000|$|Over {{the next}} six years, he {{made a number of}} other {{improvements}} and modifications to the steam engine. A double acting engine, in which the steam acted alternately on {{the two sides of the}} piston was one. He described methods for working the steam [...] "expansively" [...] (i.e., using steam at pressures well above atmospheric). A compound engine, which connected two or more engines was described. Two more patents were granted for these in 1781 and 1782. Numerous other improvements that made for easier manufacture and installation were continually implemented. One of these included the use of the steam indicator which produced an informative plot of the pressure in the cylinder against its volume, which he kept as a trade secret. Another important invention, one which Watt was most proud of, was the parallel motion which was essential in double-acting engines as it produced the straight line motion required for the cylinder rod and pump, from the connected rocking beam, whose end moves <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circular</b> <b>arc.</b> This was patented in 1784. A throttle valve to control the power of the engine, and a centrifugal governor, patented in 1788, to keep it from [...] "running away" [...] were very important. These improvements taken together produced an engine which was up to five times as efficient in its use of fuel as the Newcomen engine.|$|E

50|$|Adult Richmond birdwings {{are very}} strong fliers usually active {{in the early morning}} and near dusk, when they can be easily {{observed}} feeding on flowers such as Lantana (Lantana camara), although eucalypt and Melaleuca flowers are also utilised. Observations of O. richmondia at other times of the day can lead to false impressions of their rarity, as the species can be locally abundant, albeit in small areas. Females are often observed some distance from their habitats and a migration of sorts has been noted in the QLD-NSW border ranges following years of exceptional rainfall. Such migrations allow populations of this species to establish in highland habitats over summer, although they die out over winter due to cold.Birdwing butterflies are extremely elegant fliers, using their forewings to generate most of the power for flight. These are moved <b>in</b> almost <b>a</b> <b>circular</b> <b>arc,</b> while the hindwings act almost as a tailplane. Birdwings of the genus Troides fly <b>in</b> <b>a</b> similar manner. If disturbed, their flight becomes very erratic, essentially a series of skips and hops weaving in and out of foliage. They typically fly high in the rainforest canopy, descending only to feed or oviposit on host plants.Males routinely establish territories along creeks and in rainforest clearings and periodically patrol them during the day, again being most active at dawn and dusk. Courtship is elaborate, with the male initially chasing after the female before hovering above to douse her in pheremones from his androconial brush, a large row of hairs along the anal fold of the hindwing. Females not receptive to such overtures will avoid mating by remaining immobile and preventing the male from settling and pairing with her.|$|R

Telerobotics operation is simulated by computer control of a motor-driven device with capabilities for programmable force feedback and force measurement. A computer-controlled motor drive is developed that provides forces against the fingers as well as (angular) position control. A load cell moves <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circular</b> <b>arc</b> as it is pushed by a finger and measures reaction forces on the finger. The force exerted by the finger on the load cell and the angular position are digitized and recorded as a function of time by the computer. Flexure forces of the index, long and ring fingers of the human hand in opposition to the motor driven load cell are investigated. Results of the following experiments are presented: (1) Exertion of maximum finger force as a function of angle; (2) Exertion of target finger force against a computer controlled force; and (3) Test of the ability to move to a target force against a force that is a function of position. Averaged over ten individuals, the maximum force that could be exerted by the index or long finger is about 50 Newtons, while that of the ring finger is about 40 Newtons.
