Additionally, the salt amount, pH value and <b>drain</b> <b>weight</b> level for each sample were determined. Quantitative analysis of BPA in samples {{was carried out by}} solid phase extraction method followed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection. The mean levels of BPA in the analysed canned fish samples were determined as 0. 45 ± 0. 09, 0. 31 ± 0. 09, 0. 45 ± 0. 09 and 2. 33 ± 0. 09 mg kg - 1 for A, B, C, D brands, respectively. According to the findings of this study, it was determined that the mean BPA values of the samples except for the values obtained from D brand were below the Turkish Food Codex (TFC) values (0. 6 mg kg - 1). Furthermore, the pH values and salt amounts were in accordance with Turkish Standart Instute (TSI) values for all brands. However, mean of <b>drain</b> <b>weight</b> found in all brands were lower than the TSI value. In conclusion, some samples obtained during the period of the study are determined to have high levels of BPA.

40|$|Abstract: Although, the {{conservation}} process protects the foodstuffs from contaminations {{and increases the}} shelf life, however it causes undesirable changes in food materials. In this study, Nisin as a natural compound was used {{in order to reduce}} the effect of heat on physiochemical properties of red bean conserve in tomato sauce. To carry out this research, initially the exact duration of sterilization was determined in temperature at 121 °C. Then Nisin in concentration of 2. 5, 3. 1, 3. 7 and 4. 3 ppm were added to samples. For each of these concentrations, 5 different durations for sterilization in 121 °C were considered. Among these treatments, the samples which, like reference sample did not have any contamination and made continuation of other tests on them possible were only those and containing 3. 1 and 3. 7 ppm Nisin with 27. 5 minutes sterilization, 2. 5 and 3. 1 ppm Nisin with 30 minutes sterilization and 2. 5 ppm Nisin with 32. 5 minutes sterilization duration respectively. The results showed that with lower levels of Nisin and higher levels sterilization duration contamination would decrease. Also various concentration of Nisin did not produce significant differences in levels of pH, salt and water <b>drain</b> <b>weights</b> of samples. Significant differences in colour factors (a * and L*) is related to sterilization duration which its increase is consistent with elevation in sterilization duration, the extent of lightness (L*), redness (a*) of samples.

40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{cycle of}} the traditionally exploited sea cucumber Holothuria tubulosa was investigated in the Pagasitikos Gulf (39 degrees 18 ' 457 '' N, 23 degrees 05 ' 869 '' E) from June 2007 to July 2008. The study examined the microscopic characteristics of the gonads and was based on maturity index (MI) and oocytes' size-frequency distribution. The reproductive cycle {{was found to be}} synchronous between sexes, following an annual pattern. The minimum MI values were recorded in December and January, marking the onset of the reproductive cycle. During the spring, MI increased due to gamete development and proliferation. Mature specimens were prominent in summer while spawning occurred between July and September. The maximum MI values were recorded in mid-autumn, when most specimens were at the postspawning stage. The oocytes' size-frequency distribution showed analogous seasonal variability. The present findings are crucial for establishing an efficient management strategy for this commercial and ecosystem-engineering species, since its exploitation in Greek waters has not been under official control for more than a century.

40|$|Graduation date: 1963 Large {{amounts of}} plant tissue {{are used in}} the {{production}} of many canned, frozen and dried foods. Some of this material is unsatisfactory in appearance and texture, despite careful processing from high quality raw materials. In the present study, the changes induced in soft fruits by controlled heating and freezing treatments were of prime concern. Strawberries and tomatoes were canned and frozen in 60 ° B sucrose syrup, stored for 3 - 6 months and examined by physical and chemical methods. Measurements of the texture, pectins, hemicelluloses, cellulose, nitrogen, ash and ash constituents, were made on raw, frozen and canned samples. The tissues were sliced, macerated with 0. 4 percent sodium hexametaphosphate, and screened. The cell suspensions were dialysed and stored at 35 °F, with toluene as a preservative. The cell suspensions were analyzed similarly to the tissue samples, and the reactivity of the cell suspensions with sugars and electrolytes was investigated. The results indicated the following conclusions: 1) No significant difference was found between the effects of canning and freezing on the texture of the fruits, as determined by the Shear Press, although major {{differences were found between the}} fresh and processed samples. 2) Drained weights were lower when the fruits were canned than when frozen, especially in the strawberries. 3) Histological changes brought about by the treatments were more marked in the frozen than in the canned fruits. Freezing caused severe breakage of cell walls, plus some cell separation, whereas canning tended to cause more shrinkage of cells without much breakage or separation. Adhesion between cells was increased in the heated packs. Damage to cells increased as cell size increased. The study showed that more emphasis should be placed on selecting varieties of fruits for processing which have a smaller mean cell size, and thicker cell walls. 4) Aqueous suspensions of parenchyma cells were found to be a useful means of studying the several mechanisms involved in textural and <b>drained</b> <b>weight</b> changes. 5) No sorption affinity was found between dialysed, depectinized parenchyma cells and sucrose or glucose. 6) Dialysed cells were negatively charged, highly hydrated, and formed viscous suspensions at low concentrations. 7) The addition of small amounts of cations, particularly H⁺ ion and Al⁺⁺⁺ ion, precipitated cell suspensions, by suppressing the ionization of the carboxyl group or by salt formation. 8) A new hypothesis was proposed which assigned an important role to the acids and other electrolytes of fruits, in governing the textural and <b>drained</b> <b>weight</b> characteristics of such products. It was proposed that the quantity of acids and other electrolytes which become distributed throughout the cell during processing, causes a reduction of cell hydration including a shrinkage of cell walls, which could be partially reversed during subsequent storage...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1940 Ten, twenty, {{and thirty}} percent of {{dextrose}} were used in place of sucrose to preserve the Maraschino-type cherries because of the expectation that the smaller sized molecules would enter the cherry tissue more readily and thus increase the weight and volume of the fruit. Other samples, sucrose and percent dextrose replacement, were tested with the pH of the syrup controlled at 3. 0. Both cold and hot processes were used, and samples were tested every two days during the concentrating period for <b>drained</b> <b>weight</b> of the cherries; volume of the cherries; pH, inversion, and degree Brix of the syrup. The commercial product, with the trade name "glucose", was also tested in another series of samples. Owing to its insolubility at low temperatures only the hot process was used. The results show that dextrose increases the weight of cherries in the cold process, whereas the difference in weight gain is not as noticeable in the hot process. "Glucose" gives approximately the same results as does dextrose. High inversion of the syrup of a sample does not indicate a comparable weight gain in the cherries because the monosaccharides are concentrated in the fruit tissue.

A study was made of these changes in processed strawberries, raspberries, blackberries and blueberries, still cooked and stored at 78 °F for one and six months in No. 10 cans. Three samples of the above four berries were analyzed before processing, immediately after processing and after one and six months of storage at 78 °F. Five samples of syrups were collected from both center and side of the cans by means of 50 ml pipettes. These five samples were from top, 1 3 / 4 ", 3 l/ 2 ", and 5 1 / 4 " from the top and from the bottom and a mean sample was taken from the drained syrup. The cans were then drained on an 8 mesh 10 " screen. 100 gram samples of the drained solids from top, middle and bottom were collected for texture measurements. The results indicated the following: 1. There is a decrease in soluble solids of the syrup and <b>drained</b> <b>weight</b> of the fruit immediately after processing.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Biological Systems Engineering, Washington State UniversityMicrowave (MW) heating overcomes the {{disadvantages}} of slow conductive/convective heat transfer inherent in conventional thermal processes, and therefore {{has the potential}} to produce safe and high quality vegetable products. This research was conducted to evaluate the quality attributes of pre-packaged diced carrots after MW pasteurization and of diced tomatoes after MW sterilization, in comparison with those subjected to conventional thermal processing. A systematic study of developing MW sterilization or pasteurization processes for tomato and carrot products, and evaluating their influence on product quality is presented in this thesis. A MW-assisted sterilization thermal process (MAST) achieving a target F value of no less than 6 min was developed for processing diced tomatoes packaged in 8 -oz pouches, which can deliver a 5 D thermal treatment to Bacillus coagulans ATCC 8038 spores. For diced carrots, MW assisted pasteurization processes (MAP) with F 90 °C= 3 min and F 90 °C= 10 min were developed to achieve at least 6 D reductions of NP C. botulinum type E spores. Thermal resistance of the target bacterium (B. coagulans spores) in tomatoes was characterized, and kinetics of texture degradation of carrots were investigated for developing thermal processes for these products. Tomato/carrot dices with added salts (NaCl/CaCl 2) at commonly used commercial levels were processed, and their dielectric properties were determined and used for computer simulation of heating patterns and cold spot locations in sample pouches. The quality related attributes of processed tomatoes (<b>drained</b> <b>weight,</b> soluble solids, color, texture, ascorbic acid, and lycopene content) and carrots (color, texture, pectin methylesterase activity, and carotenoids) were assessed.

Therefore, titanium alloy housing dummies were immersed in 25 ml heparinized human blood. The dummies were constantly tempered at specific temperatures (37 - 45 °C) over 15 minutes {{as well as one}} dummy was used as a blank sample and was not tempered. Blood samples were withdrawn for blood parameter analysis and the determination of the plasmatic coagulation cascade. The quantity of adhesions on surfaces were determined by <b>drained</b> <b>weight</b> and underwent histological analysis, likewise one sample was evaluated using FACS (Fluorescent activated Cell Sorter) for further information. With regard to red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and hematocrit, no statistically significant temperature-dependent difference could be shown at temperatures up to 45 °C. Yet, respecting the conditions of the dummies and the blank sample, hemoglobin as well as PF 4 (platelet factor 4) seem to be significantly altered by elevated temperatures. Referring to red blood cells, hematocrit, hemoglobin and especially to platelets a significant decrease in terms of cell count could be shown. However, the descent {{does not appear to be}} temperature-dependent but correlates with the formation of surface adhesions. Towards 41 °C, adhesions seem to increase, whereas temperatures above 43 °C show a tendency to a decreasing amount of surface adhesions. Moreover, analyzed by an optical microscope, surface adhesions exposed to higher temperatures demonstrate elevated levels of granulocytes. Also, a temperature-dependent ascending trend towards 43 °C could be seen with respect to the amount of activated platelets in FACS analysis. The results of our study suggest that human blood basically tolerates temperatures up to 45 °C during the investigated time of 15 minutes. Still, alterations in blood-consistency can be observed. Especially the contact to extrinsic surfaces seems to strongly alter the mentioned parameters. Yet, a critical surface temperature not leading to any undesirable effects on human blood could not be identified within this study...|$|E

40|$|The fruit {{production}} industry is of significant economic {{importance in the}} state of Utah. The annual receipts by the producers of fruit is usually between 3, 000, 000 and 5, 000, 000 according to Utah Agricultural Statistics (1963). With the farmer receiving only about 38 percent of the consumer 2 ̆ 7 s dollar this amounts to approximately 9, 000, 000 to 15, 000, 000 total contribution by the fruit industry. The recent trend, however, is a slight reduction in acreage, number of farms, and total production of fruit. One of the major problems of the fruit industry and all agriculture in the state is the small size of the farms. In our present day of high specialization and modern technology it is not economically possible for the small farms to compete with the large units of other areas, particularly the west coast. Closely allied with this problem is the high value of real estate in the areas climatically suited for the growing of fruit. This latter problem {{is a result of the}} competition between fruit producers and home owners for the bench lands near the large towns and cities in the state. This has forced the fruit growers to seek new and lower priced areas for plantings. There has been some success in relocating orchards under new irrigation projects remote from the urban areas where the lower value of land will permit an economical operation. There is room for further expansion, but the size of the farms will need to be increased to provide economical units that can compete favorably with other large production areas. Utah residents presently consume more fruit than is grown in the state. This is because during the season of production there is a surplus of most of the fruits and a considerable quantity is shipped from the state in the form of fresh fruit. Utah processes a much smaller percentage of its fruit than the national average according to Taylor (1964). The population of Utah and the neighboring states is rapidly increasing as is the population of the entire country. At the same time the production of fruit is not increasing as is the population of the entire country. At the same time the production of fruit is not increasing at a corresponding rate. The weather in Utah provides another problem to the fruit industry. Although the weather every place in the United States has a strong bearing on the industry, the effect of the weather is more prevalent in Utah than most areas because of the frequent late spring frosts and the occasional extreme winters. In years when the weather is favorable for high yields a marketing problem exists. The above average crops fail to bring extra revenue because of the lack of markets and often the total revenue is less for the high yields than for the mediocre yields because the excessive supply forces the unit price received by the producer to a point where the gross receipts are less than for the average crop. These are some of the major problems the fruit industry of Utah faces today. Many have foreseen the solution of the problem to be the expansion of the fruit processing industry in the state. Carpenter (1949) and Nielson (1964) feel that this should be done by small cooperative canneries. Schermerhorn and Korzan (1962) feel that in order to survive the competition a large name brand company would be required. It is unquestioned that a processing industry would be of benefit to the fruit industry in Utah. A processing industry would stabilize prices to a great extent. It would allow the state to be more self-sustaining and provide for possible expansion of the fruit industry. Processing companies have highly skilled research organizations to assist growers in imporoving production. These are many of the things a processing industry has done in other areas and can do in Utah. However, many changes would be required in Utah production to adapt to a processing industry. Some of these changes are: (1) Processors must be insured of a uniform source of supply each year and have fruit available to them not only when the fresh market is oversupplied. (2) The volume of fruit must be large enough to allow for efficiency of the processing plant. (3) Some orchards need to be planted specifically for processing. (4) Quality control must be maintained from the producer right through the processor - the processed product can be no better than the raw material that goes into it. (5) Research must be conducted to determine the best processing varieties, harvest maturities, and ripening procedures. (6) In addition to adequate volume, a sufficient number of commoditites must be grown for processing to add diversification and extend the processing season over a reasonable period of time. This report concerns the effects of variety, maturity, and storage on the quality and nutritive value of certain fruits processed by freezing and canning with a view to the possibilities of expanding the fruit processing industry in Utah. Several varieties of apricots, cherries, peaches, pears, plums and strawberries were studied.

Holothurians' length was a moderate predictor of biomass since r values reached 60 %; in contrast a very strong relation was observed between <b>drained</b> and gutted <b>weight.</b> Size-frequency distribution analysis was unimodal with the exception of spring where a second mode of larger sized individuals appeared. The gonadosomatic index showed a single spawning season per year, in late summer; accordingly the reproductive cycle of the species showed a clear annual pattern which was highly correlated with the seasonal variations of temperature...|$|R

The battery consisted of seven pasted lead-antimony grid positives and eight plated copper-screen egatives covered with sponge cadmium. Open-circuit voltage is ap-proximately 2. 4. The batteries were discharged at the constant current density shown in Fig. 1. The performance characteristics are shown in Fig. 1 and 2. Table I shows the capacity of a representative cadmium-lead peroxide cell at various discharge rates and at tempera-tures of- 28. 9 ~ (- 20 ~ to + 26. 7 ~ (80 ~ Lower dis-charge voltages and lower capacities result when batteries are dry-stored for extended periods. The sponge-cadmium cells have a slightly higher discharge voltage and a shghtly greater capacity than the lead-lead peroxide cells at higher discharge rates and at lower tempera-tures. They also are lighter in weight. This system has been adapted to special military-purpose units where high <b>drain</b> and light <b>weight</b> are important factors. These units must be used promptly after activation since sponge cadmium plates react vigorously with the sulfuric acid electrolyte, with liberation of hydrogen. Open-circuit stands {{of more than one}} hour after activation are not recom-mended. The vigorous gassing also presents a serious problem in the design of nonspill or sealed units...|$|R
40|$|Four {{species of}} dendrochirote holothurians, Roweia stephensoni John, Pseudocnella sykion Lampert, Aslia spyridophora Clark, Roweia frauenfeldi frauenfeldi Ludwig, and one aspidochirote holothurian, Neostichopus grammatus Clark, are common {{inhabitants}} of the intertidal regions of the eastern Cape rocky shores of South Africa. All five species are sympatric {{for most of their}} geographical distribution. The intertidal distributions, densities and biomasses of R. stephensoni, P. sykion and N. grammatus were examined at six sites from Port Elizabeth to East London in the eastern Cape. At all sites the three species showed similar overlapping zonations with R. stephensoni and P. sykion reaching their highest maximum mean densities and biomasses (<b>drained</b> wet <b>weight)</b> in the lower mid-shore region (401 m² and 684 g/m², 181 m² and 269 g/m², respectively at Port Elizabeth), whilst N. grammatus in the low-shore region (61 m² and 72 g/m², at Port Elizabeth). The highest densities and biomasses of all three species were recorded on boulder shores that had minimal sand inundation. Seasonality of reproduction of R. stephensoni, P. sykion and N. grammatus was compared at Port Elizabeth, using gonad index values, gonadal tubule diameters, egg diameters and spermatozoon content in tubules from January 1992 until August 1993. All three species are dioecious and did not deviate from a 1 : 1 sex ratio. Sizes at first sexual maturity were 2. 5 - 2. 9 cm³ for R. stephensoni and P. sykion, and 3. 0 - 3. 9 cm³ for N. grammatus. The gonads of R. stephensoni and P. sykion consist of a bunch of unbranched tubules of equal diameter, with males having more tubules of a smaller diameter than females. By contrast, the gonad of N. grammatus consists of two tufts of multiple branched tubules. All three species followed annual reproductive cycles, and in R. stephensoni and P. sykion gametogenesis occurred from March 1992 until August/September 1992, and maturity was maintained until the main spawning event in January 1993. By contrast, in N. grammatus gametogenesis occurred from July 1992 until September 1992, and maturity was maintained until the main spawning event in December 1992 /January 1993. Unlike R. stephensoni and P. sykion the reproductive cycle of N. grammatus was more pronounced, in that the gonad regressed after spawning. Aspects of the feeding biology of R. stephensoni, P. sykion, A. spyridophora, R. ffrauenfeldi and N. grammatus were compared, using the gross buccal tentacle morphology, type and size range of ingested food particles, and gut lengths. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the buccal tentacles of R. stephensoni, P. sykion and A. spyridophora could be classified as dendritic, branching numerous times with the tips terminating in numerous nodes covered with discs of papillate projections. The buccal tentacle structure of R. f frauenfeldi deviated from the typical dendrochirote dendritic form. The tentacles are stout with few branches which terminate in large bulbous nodes lacking discs of papillate projections. Neostichopus grammatus possesses buccal tentacles that could be classified as peltate, terminating in large nodes which also lacked discs of papillate projections. Roweia stephensoni, P. sykion and A. spyridophora are suspension-feeders, ingesting food particles mostly < 53 pm in size. Roweia f frauenfeldi was classed as a "heavy" suspension-feeder, ingesting food particles mostly between 250 pm-l. 18 mm, while N. grammatus is a deposit-feeder, ingesting benthic sediments mostly between 106 - 500 pm. The gut lengths of the dendrochirote holothurians were found to be significantly longer than that of the aspidochirote, and may be attributed {{to the nature of the}} food ingested. ...|$|R
