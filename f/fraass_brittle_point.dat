40|$|The Moriyoshi Breaking Point (MBP) test, Fraass Breaking Point (FBP) {{test and}} {{conventional}} tests, i. e., performance-related grade tests {{developed by the}} Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP), were performed on asphalt of various ages at low temperatures, and the Thermal Stress Restrained Specimen Test (TSRST) on asphalt mixtures. In addition, a field investigation on relationships between the MBP of asphalt residuals aged by the High Temperature Long Time Durability test (HTLTD) and pavement-cracking temperatures was conducted. A strong correlation {{was found between the}} results of the MBP, FBP and conventional tests performed on asphalt concrete. The rate of strain and <b>brittle</b> <b>point</b> of the asphalts were linear during the various tests, and the MBP temperature after HTLTD testing could be used to prevent low-temperature cracking. この論文は低温で種々の劣化状態のアスファルトを用い，森吉ぜい化点（MBP）試験，フラースぜい化点（FBP）試験，SHRP（戦略的道路研究プログラム）が開発した試験との関係，およびこれらとアスファルト混合物の熱応力試験（TSRST）等との関係について述べている。加えて，高温長期耐久性試験（HTLTD）で劣化したアスファルトの森吉ぜい化点（MBP）と舗装のき裂との関係の現場調査も行っている。MBP，FBPおよびアスファルト混合物で実施した通常の試験の間に強い相関関係が得られた。ひずみ速度とアスファルトのぜい化点との関係も直線関係にあり，HTLTD後のMBP温度はアスファルト舗装の低温き裂現象を防ぐ一つの指標であることを明らかにした...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. According {{to the low}} {{temperature}} disease on asphalt pavement {{in the areas of}} cold and large temperature difference between day and night, conventional index test and {{low temperature}} bending creep test were used to analyze the influence of diatomite dosage on the low temperature performance of diatomite modified asphalt, and the mixture’s low temperature bending test was applied for verification. Test results show that after diatomite’s addition into asphalt, equivalent <b>brittle</b> <b>point</b> reduces significantly, ductility test cannot estimate low temperature performance very well, stiffness modulus increases and relaxation ability decreases; meanwhile, peak value of stiffness modulus and strain energy of asphalt mixture can be found, the low temperature crack resistance is enhanced; optimum dosage of diatomite is 13 %. So, the low temperature performance evaluation method of diatomite modified asphalt mixture through BBR’s low temperature performance evaluation on diatomite modified asphalt remains to be discussed...|$|R

50|$|Larch Mountain is {{the remnant}} {{of an ancient}} shield volcano, with broad slopes {{covering}} tens of square kilometers. It is currently the tallest peak in the Boring Lava Field, a volcanic field active during the Plio-Pleistocene time frame. Active between 1.8 and 1.4 million years ago, the volcano is composed mainly of basalts, although the summit at Sherrard Point is composed mainly of iron-rich andesite. Larch Mountain's basalt is tough to distinguish from the surrounding Columbia River Basalt, although the Columbia River Basalt is slightly lighter in color and less <b>brittle.</b> Sherrard <b>Point</b> is the eroded remains of the original volcanic plug.|$|R
5000|$|Zintl phases are a {{subgroup}} of <b>brittle,</b> high melting <b>point</b> intermetallic compounds which are diamagnetic or exhibit temperature-independent paramagnetism, are poor conductors or semiconductors. Zintl {{noted that there}} was an atomic volume contraction when these compounds were formed and realised this could indicate cation formation. He suggested that the structures of Zintl phases were ionic, where there was complete electron transfer from the more electropositive metal. The structure of the anion (nowadays called the Zintl ion) should then be considered {{on the basis of the}} resulting electronic state. These ideas were further developed to become the Zintl rule or Zintl Klemm concept, where the polyanion structure should be similar to an isoelectronic element.|$|R
50|$|The {{two major}} {{processes}} of {{hardening and tempering}} {{can be broken down}} into four major steps. First, a piece of carbon steel is heated gradually until it reaches a temperature above the alloy's critical temperature. The steel is then quenched, usually in water or oil (though other quenches, such as brine or sodium hydroxide solutions, are sometimes used to achieve a particular result). The steel is now at that given alloy's maximum hardness, but as discussed above, also <b>brittle.</b> At this <b>point,</b> tempering is usually performed to achieve a more useful balance of hardness and toughness. The steel is gradually heated until the desired temper colours are drawn, generally at a temperature significantly lower than the alloy's critical point. Different colours in the temper spectrum reflect different balances of hardness to toughness, so different temper levels are appropriate for different applications. The steel is then re-quenched to 'fix' the temper at the desired level. A talented smith or metalworker can fine-tune the performance of a steel tool or item to precisely what is required based solely on careful observation of temper colours. A visual representation of this process may make the concept easier to understand.|$|R
5000|$|All plastic {{is subject}} to {{deterioration}} through physical or chemical means, and thus, motion picture film {{is subject to}} the same deterioration. Films deteriorate over time, which can damage individual frames or even lead to the entire film being destroyed. Cellulose nitrate, cellulose diacetate and triacetate are known to be unstable mediums: improperly preserved film can deteriorate in a period of time much faster than many photographs or other visual presentations. Cellulose nitrate, because of its unstable chemistry, eventually breaks down, releasing nitric acid, further catalyzing the decomposition. In the final stages of celluloid decomposition, the film turns into a rust-like powder. Likewise, tri-acetate stock is also vulnerable to deterioration. Because of the small gauge of the film, owners of home-made films often find that their film can become shrunken and <b>brittle</b> to the <b>point</b> where the film is unwatchable {{in the space of a}} few years. In general, decaying acetate film breaks down into acetic acid, and similar to celluloid decomposition, leads to an auto-catylictic breakdown of the base that cannot be reversed. The result of the acetic acid released is a strong odor of vinegar, which is why the decay process in the archival community is known as [...] "vinegar syndrome". Modern polyester-based stocks are far more stable by comparison and are rated to last hundreds of years if stored properly.|$|R
40|$|The BGA {{packages}} {{have many}} advantages over conventional modules in IC packaging industries. For BGA assemblies, the solder joints {{are not only}} the passage for electrical signals, power, and ground, but also provide mechanical support to hold the module in position on the printed circuit board (PCB). Therefore, solder joint reliability {{is a major concern}} for BGA packages. The conventional method to evaluate solder ball attachment strength is the ball shear test (following JESD 22 -B 117). In the past few years, the ball pull test configuration has been developed. In this thesis, experimental investigations were performed on the effects of testing conditions of conventional solder ball shear and pull tests for BGA packages. The emphasis is placed on understanding the progressive failure mechanisms during the ball shear and pull tests. The critical reflow cooling rate of large Ag 3 Sn plate formation was studied using lead free SnAgCu (SAC) solder balls. The ball shear and pull characteristics were tested on SAC solder balls cooled at different rates, which assessed the effects of large Ag 3 Sn plates on the room-temperature mechanical properties of SAC solder joints. This study also describes the formation and growth of intermetallic compound (IMC) at the interface of Sn 3. 5 %Ag and Sn 4. 0 %Ag 0. 5 %Cu reflow soldered on different types of substrate pad surface finishes. The effects of IMC growth after soldering and thermal aging at 150 ℃ are discussed. The attachment strength of solder balls subject to thermal aging was investigated by the conventional ball shear and pull tests. The test results indicate that the ball pull test method can reveal the brittle failure of solder joints with a higher sensitivity, especially under a fast loading speed. As a result, the effects of IMC growth can be identified more easily. In order to predict the solder joint reliability under drop conditions, it is important to increase the testing speed of package level test methods, such as high-speed solder ball shear and pull. Conventional ball shear and pull tests are not considered suitable for evaluation of joint reliability under drop loading since the applied test speeds, usually lower than 5 mm/s, are below the impact velocity applied to the solder joint in a drop test. It is necessary to study the characterization of high-speed ball shear and pull tests, including the failure mode and brittle fracture mechanism during these high speed tests. The brittle fracture surfaces were systematically analyzed on SnAgCu and SnPb solder balls after high-speed ball shear and pull tests, which led to a fundamental understanding of the failure mechanisms of solder balls under high speed mechanical loading. This study includes comprehensive high-magnification SEM/EDX characterization of the brittle fracture surfaces after high-speed ball shear/pull tests. Detailed images of the fractured surfaces of both the solder balls and the corresponding package pads were recorded. To evaluate the sensitivity of high-speed ball shear and pull tests to brittle failure, the morphologies and element distributions of the brittle fracture surfaces induced by these two methods are also compared. High-magnification SEM/EDX analysis of the fracture interfaces indicated that the solder residue on the package pad is more prevalent for SnPb solder compared to SnAgCu solder, and for high-speed shear testing compared to pull testing. The study was performed to compare the high speed ball shear/ball pull tests with the board level mechanical drop test. The emphasis is placed on the correlation of the failure mode and energy absorption between these two testing methods. The objective is to investigate the feasibility of using high speed ball shear/ball pull tests as an alternative method to evaluate solder joint integrity under dynamic loading. This study compared high-speed bondtesting (shear and pull) with board level drop testing (BLDT) of BGA packages using Sn 4. 0 %Ag 0. 5 %Cu solder balls and either an ENIG or OSP package substrate surface finish. High-speed shear and pull tests were carried out at various speeds; failure modes were recorded, together with force and fracture energy data. In addition, a detailed microscopic analysis (SEM and EDX) was executed on both complementary surfaces (ball and pad) of brittle fracture failures from both the shear and pull test samples. The results of these studies showed high similarity to those from brittle fractures generated during BLDT of the same packages. Furthermore, there was a strong correlation between the various bondtesting parameters at the <b>point</b> <b>brittle</b> fractures occurred and the number of drops to failure seen in BLDT. In summary, it is suggested that brittle fractures obtained in high-speed bondtesting are a strong indicator of BLDT behavior...|$|R
40|$|Brecciated fabrics, {{coupled with}} authigenic {{carbonate}} precipitation, extensively affect the carbonatic units {{developed during the}} Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC) of the Mediterranean Sea. These limestones represent a complex unit in terms of genesis and stratigraphy: they show a rich facies inventory and are intimately related to a major basin-scale unconformity (the MES, Messinian Erosional Surface). The brecciated limestones are known as “Calcare di Base” Fm. (basal limestone) and show sulphur-bearing lithofacies at places. They have been long investigated and the attempt to group them {{on the basis of}} sedimentological, mineralogical and geochemical datasets results in still fragmentary models, where the fabric aspects have not been highlighted yet, nor the trigger for the wholesale brecciation hasn’t been clearly defined. Two different triggers for brecciation have been so far claimed: evaporitic collapse and mass wasting processes. The relation between the upper Messinian breccias and fluid migration, to date only speculated, is tested in the present study using a suite of sedimentary techniques (outcrop facies analysis, natural radioactive measurements, facies and fabric investigations) and geochemical techniques (XRD and EDS analyses, stable isotopes δ 18 O and δ 13 C, organic geochemistry). The brecciated limestones widely crop out in the Western Mediterranean area: some key-sections located in Italy (Maiella area; Calabrian Arc; Sicily) have been chosen in this thesis to obtain an exhaustive stratigraphic framework and a genetic model for the Upper Messinian breccias. The overall challenge is to validate the role of investigating brecciated fabric as: 1) a sedimentological tool for detecting ancient cold seeps, offering a contribute to the “paleo-seep search strategy”; 2) an opportunity to achieve an outstanding insight into the processes taking place below the seafloor in modern seepage settings. The Messinian breccias are made up of limestones exhibiting high variability in facies and thickness: their geometry varies from a patchy distribution within a host sediment to massive or stratified thick bodies interbedded with pelitic horizons. The carbonatic beds consist of locally brecciated marly lime mudstones, highly cemented, devoid of gravity segregation and any preferential distribution. Generally brecciation overprints the primary fabric, resulting in fabric-retentive breccias (in situ brecciation). Breccias are typified by monomictic subangular clasts, showing scale-invariant fabric and lithology-independent patterns. Brecciation, accompanied by fluid migration pathways occurring at any scale of observation, is a diffused phenomenon at the mesoscale, but localized at the microscale. This possibly accounts for variation in the energy input of the fluids, supposed to have triggered brecciation in such environments. - 2 - The co-occurrence of plastic and <b>brittle</b> behaviour proxies <b>point</b> to fluidification and associated brecciation phenomena taking place in a partly unlithified sedimentary column, typified by differential diagenesis. Both the carbonates and the pelitic fraction show an intense natural radioactivity (up to 63 Cps), mostly related to authigenic 238 U. The geochemical dataset is complex and shows wide ranges both in δ 18 O (+ 7. 74 down to - 9. 64 ‰ PDB) and δ 13 C values (+ 4. 14 down to - 43. 7 ‰ PDB). This is the result of: 1) originally mixed carbon sources involved in authigenesis; 2) a complex fluid-rock interaction; 3) different fluid composition in the different basins (in the Maiella Basin and at Capodarso - in the Caltanissetta basin - they were enriched in hydrocarbons; in the Calabrian Arc and in Centuripe - in the Caltanissetta basin - the nature of the fluids, was possibly saline). In addition, the coupled positive δ 18 O - negative δ 13 C widely typifying the Calcare di Base both in Sicily and Calabria, could be related to gas hydrate destabilization processes, since textures resembling gas-hydrate bearing sediments were observed as well. A revisiting of the term “seep limestone” is proposed herein, since the aforementioned facies and fabric association enucleates important sedimentological proxies for the detection of seep limestones: (a) irregular geometries of the geobodies; (b) primary fabric overprinting; (c) peculiar textural characters of breccias; (d) scale-independent and lithology-independent patterns; (e) complex rheology; (f) fabric resembling gas-hydrate infilling sediments. The upper Messinian brecciated limestones occur in correspondence to different phases of the Messinian Salinity Crisis, but are strictly related to the regional unconformity: the MES {{played a critical role in}} the brecciation processes. There is no evidence to consider the upper Messinian breccias as a stratigraphic unit: the processes of brecciation and widespread fluid migration took place, involving different stratigraphic levels, according to their rheology and to the structural local setting. The age of this processes is constrained to the early upper Messinian phase, before the development of the Lago-Mare event. The major drawdown of the Mediterranean Sea recorded by the MES corresponds to a huge sea level drop: this most likely represents the primary trigger for fluid migration: the high depressurization experienced by the sedimentary column after the removal of at least 1 km of water column, could have likely favoured a catastrophic migration of overpressured fluids from below...|$|R
