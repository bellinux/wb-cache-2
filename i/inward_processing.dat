Thereby, it distinguishes between size, relative factor endowment, (other) cost factors and infrastructure variables. Using a large panel of bilateral processing trade flows of the EU 12 countries at the aggregate level over the period 1988 – 1999, we find that infrastructure variables, relative factor endowments and other cost variables are important determinants for the EU's outward processing trade. Costs also {{play a key role}} for the EU's <b>inward</b> <b>processing</b> trade...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the impact of {{manufacturing}} internationalisation, in the forms of international trade, cooperation agreements – measured by <b>inward</b> and outward <b>processing</b> trade (IPT and OPT, respectively) - and FDI, on the transport industry employment. Descriptive statistics and econometric analysis are carried out at the “regional-industry” level (20 NUTS 2 regions and 8 transport sub-industries) with reference to Italy in the period 1996 - 2001. Results show that export, FDI and the components of IPT (temporary import and re-export) positively affect the transport employment variation in 1996 - 2001, while import and the components of OPT (temporary export and re-import) display a negative impact...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the robustness of {{the output of}} a Bayesian network, a sensitivity analysis can be performed in which {{the relation between the}} output and each of the (probability) parameters of the network is established. This relation is given as a quotient of two linear functions in a parameter under study. Current methods for computing the coefficients of these functions relies on a large number of probability propagations. In this paper, we present a method which only requires a single outward propagation in a junction tree for computing the coefficients associated with all the parameters, in addition to an <b>inward</b> propagation for <b>processing</b> evidence. Conversely, the method also only requires a single outward propagation for computing the coefficients associated with a single parameter and all possible outputs. We show that these results also hold for the analysis of the effects of joint variations of sets of parameters, known as n-way sensitivity analysis...|$|R

40|$|With an {{increasing}} international trade, a {{more and more}} significant expansion was experienced by combined commercial operations, also including goods processing transactions. The expansion of these international economic affairs had as motivation the multiple direct and indirect positive effects they produce both at micro and macro level, such as: obtaining a significant commercial profit and on this basis, increasing the currency contribution, increasing the general indicator of the international trade volume, relieving the balance of external payments of certain payments in currency, making optimum use of production capacity and labour force etc. Given {{the complexity of the}} combined commercial operations of foreign trade, in this article we shall address the commercial transactions of <b>inward</b> <b>processing</b> of foreign goods in terms of accounting models specific for conducting these transactions. In this regard, after the theoretical delimitation of these operations we shall emphasize the benefits of <b>inward</b> <b>processing</b> of foreign goods but also without forgetting the limitations of these international commercial operations. To develop accounting models we shall first clarify the tax matters that affect the entry in the accounts of <b>inward</b> <b>processing</b> of foreign goods, then we shall proceed to their reflection in accounting starting from a case study, if the recipient of such operations is based in the extra-community or community area. Thus {{we will be able to}} identify the conditions that the entities must meet in order to use as little cash money, the affecting fiscal conditions and the reflection in accounting of <b>inward</b> <b>processing</b> of foreign goods.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} impacts of an export {{promotion}} policy, namely the <b>Inward</b> <b>Processing</b> Regime, on Turkish trade, employment and competitiveness. Several trade indices as well as descriptive statistics are {{used to assess the}} effects of the regime for the period of 2002 - 2014. It is concluded that its implementation has not been effective more than the average progress in trade flows, employment and competitiveness. There is no clear evidence that Turkish exporters use the regime in order to avoid customs taxes and trade remedies. By reducing the cost of imported inputs with world prices and providing them in a timely manner, the regime places Turkish exporters on an equal footing with others in third countries. In addition, thanks to this regime Turkish businesses, in order to sell good quality products to the world, can reach raw materials, semi-manufactured products or high technology equipment that cannot be provided from the domestic market and that are necessary for an ambitious manufacturing process. Therefore, the application of <b>Inward</b> <b>Processing</b> Regime should be continued as a complementary part of the global supply chain. <b>Inward</b> <b>Processing</b> Regime; Export Incentives; Competitiveness; Competitiveness Indice...|$|E

40|$|Context {{variability}} can {{be defined}} as the number of preexperimental contexts in which a given concept appears. Following M. Steyvers and K. J. Malmberg’s (2003) work, the authors have shown that concepts that are experienced in fewer preexperimental contexts generally are better remembered in episodic memory tasks than concepts that are experienced in a greater number of preexperimental contexts. The {{purpose of this article is}} to demonstrate that low context variability confers its memorial advantage because of stronger item-to-list context associations as compared with high context variability. Three experiments that use environmental context changes from study to test demonstrate that the low context variability advantage is eliminated when item-to-list context associations are not available because of environmental changes at test. In addition, the low context variability advantage is eliminated when <b>inward</b> <b>processing</b> at study prevents the formation of item-to-list context associations...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine applicability of the <b>Inward</b> <b>Processing</b> Regime (IPR) in enterprises which are vegetable oil producers and exporters. The data was obtained from 26 vegetable oil producer and exporter enterprises by using survey method. Frequency tables, indices, and percentage calculating were used to analyse Data. Also, SWOT analysis was used to determine the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats in the sector, and relationship among some variables were examined with correlation coefficient. According to research findings, 25 of the enterprises (96 %) utilised the IPR. Since the enterprises started to use that system; availability of cheap raw material, rate of capacity utilisation, market share, and export value all have increased. In addition, raw material was found as an important expense item, and the most important problems were qualified as raw material inadequacy and high input prices...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{fragmentation and}} globalisation {{in the context}} of the electronics industry in Ireland. Fragmentation refers to the breaking-up of vertically integrated production processes into various components. We find empirical evidence of fragmentation in a number of data sources. Data on <b>inward</b> <b>processing</b> trade indicate that production in the Irish electronics industry is globally fragmented, and that the scale of such fragmented production is growing. Furthermore, Ireland’s share of fragmentation is rising faster than that in the EU generally, especially in the electronics industry. Other firm survey data show that the scale of local fragmentation has risen relative to global fragmentation as firms in different Irish intermediate goods producing sectors trade increasingly on the local Irish market. Looking more specifically at the computer manufacturing sector, we find evidence of fragmented production in this sector in that the ratio of bought-in materials to total sales has risen significantly over the past decade.

40|$|It was {{the overall}} {{aim of this}} paper to {{highlight}} some {{of the implications of}} international production networks (or international fragmentation of production) on the relevance of comparative advantages, on some of their measures, on the determinants of economic activity. First, we emphasised that vertical, international disintegration of production processes necessarily blurs the concepts of comparative advantage as we know it and leads to a lessening of its power in explaining both merchandise composition and directions of trade; on the other hand, the concept of absolute advantage becomes increasingly relevant, as trade in intermediates grows at the world level. The basic reason for this result is that with trade in intermediates the factor content of traded final goods is no longer solely determined by autarkic relative factor endowments (in the Heckscher-Ohlin class of models), nor by autarkic relative productivities (as in the Ricardian class of models). Second, we have shown that with international fragmentation of production traditional measures of revealed comparative advantages may be misleading. These measures are still useful under the condition that the overall trade flows are properly disaggregated by reason of exchange. Data on trade in intermediates are useful in that they can offer a measure of the degree of production integration of any given domestic industry within the international production network: the upshot is that integration should no longer be thought of as simple trade integration, as we are accustomed to think of it. Third, we moved on to estimate a simple model of aggregate demand accounting for international trade in intermediates: our estimates show that the participationto this form of international division of labour can significantly affect the level of economic activity of a country above and beyond effects due to more traditional forms of international economic integration. More precisely, <b>inward</b> <b>processing</b> traffic appears to be a powerful contribution to GDP growth in ways other than those followed by ‘traditional’ exports of final goods. Thus our results show that international fragmentation of production changes the way we should look at international trade patterns irreversibly...|$|E
40|$|International {{trade has}} been defined as the engine of growth by {{international}} development institutions as more cross-border trade associated with more economic activity, higher employment, hence, poverty alleviation. If trade is the engine of growth, trade finance can be defined as grease for the engine. Hence, availing more funds to finance the enormous amount of international trade, counting about half of global GDP, is an important agenda for the OIC as well as many multilateral development institutions. The main reason behind the efforts to avail more funds for trade finance is to direct valuable financial resources from speculation to explore opportunities to increase international trade in a way to grease and roll the wheel of real economy. With reference to the OIC Ten-Year Programme of Action to Meet the Challenges Facing the Muslim countries in the 21 st century, this research aims to introduce outward-looking, cost-effective, and informal policy options for a resilient OIC trade integration to increase international trade among OIC countries. In this regard, the first essay aims to explore the determinants of recent increase in intra-OIC trade to ascertain if it is due to policy instruments implemented by OIC organs or some other externalities. It is argued that recent increase in intra-OIC trade percentage {{is likely to be the}} product of reverse effects of oil price surge and Euro appreciation but not trade diversion effect of OIC membership. OIC membership itself alone would not increase intra-OIC trade if not accompanied with policy instrument for trade facilitation to make cross-border trade easier among member countries. However, as customs revenue constitutes the bulk of public revenue for many OIC countries, they need to be convinced about benefit of trade facilitation. Accordingly, with reference to the unwillingness of OIC countries for trade facilitation, the same essay scrutinizes the effect of tariff and WTO Customs Valuation Agreement on customs’ revenue of OIC countries. The results suggest that increasing tariffs might increase customs revenue for big countries but not for small countries. Besides, the implementation of WTO Customs Valuation Agreement does not decrease customs revenue as its indirect undervaluation effect would be surpassed by its direct effect of less incentive for tax evasion. As a crucial crop for public finances in many OIC countries and initial stage of industrialization, special emphasis is given to development of the cotton sector under the OIC Ten-Year Programme of Action. The Third Expert Group Meeting on Enhancing Production Efficiency and International Competitiveness in OIC Cotton-Producing Countries adopted the Five-Year OIC Cotton Plan of Action (2007 - 2011). As per the mandate of OIC, two Islamic trade finance products are proposed, one for the cotton sector through the resources mobilized with mudarabah, by proposing salam for complete supply chain financing in the second essay, and another for resource mobilization based on 2 -Step murabahah in the context of international trade as an alternative to commodity murabahah, sukuk as well as mudarabah in the third essay. In conclusion, based on further findings of the survey, the questionnaire and interviews; capacity building in trade facilitation for small countries to be complemented with OIC mutual recognition agreement for standard and conformity assessment within halal food standard development; integrated single window among OIC countries’ customs; OIC cumulation system of rules of origin for market access; <b>inward</b> <b>processing</b> relief as an alternative to free trade zones; development of the cotton sector among OIC countries to address production constraints of LDMCs and 2 -Step murabahah to mobilize trade finance resources to boost trade of OIC countries, particularly for LDMCs, are proposed as a part of concretely defined and well-grounded OIC trade integration framework...|$|E
