Their complexity and magnitude is rapidly increasing and their distributed version (DDoS attacks) is becoming a nuisance to modern IT infrastructure and a very challenging detection problem [2]. Various detection solutions are proposed and many intrusion detection tools attempt to identify DDoS attacks mostly through anomaly detection, i. e. identification of deviations from normal operation patterns. We present an anomaly detection solution that relies on network flow data exported from CISCO Netflow-enabled [3] devices; this work is inspired by and augments the algorithm and set of metrics initially proposed in [4]. The proposed detection algorithm monitors flow data from all interfaces of border routing equipment and calculates specific metrics that are compared against adaptive thresholds that characterize the “normal ” network utilization.

It introduces deontic input-output automata —an extension of input-output automata with permissions and obligations — and an automated synthesis technique over this formalism to support such derivation.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis concerns the design, {{development and implementation of}} two digital components to be used, primarily, in autonomously operating embedded systems, such as mobile robots. The first component is an image coprocessor, for high-speed morphological image processing, and the second is a hardware-based genetic algorithm coprocessor, which provides evolutionary computation functionality for embedded applications. The morphological image coprocessor, the Clutter-II, has been optimised for efficiency of implementation, processing speed and system integration. The architecture employs a compact hardware structure for its implementation of the morphological neighbourhood transformations. The compact structure realises a significantly reduced hardware resource cost. The resources saved by the compact structure can be used to increase parallelism in image processing operations, thereby improving processing speed in a similarly significant manner. The design of the Clutter-II as a coprocessor enables easy-to-use and efficient access to its image processing capabilities from the host system processor and application software. High-speed <b>input-output</b> <b>interfaces,</b> with separated instruction and data buses, provide effective communication with system components external to the Clutter-II. A substantial part of the work {{presented in}} this thesis concerns the practical implementation of morphological filters for the Clutter-II, using the compact transformation structure. To derive efficient filter implementations, a genetic algorithm has been developed. The algorithm optimises the filter implementation by minimising the number of operations required for a particular filter. The experience gained from the work on the genetic algorithm inspired the development of the second component, the HERPUC. HERPUC is a hardware-based genetic algorithm processor, which employs a novel hardware implementation of the selection mechanism of the algorithm. This, in combination with a flexible form of recombination operator, has made the HERPUC an efficient hardware implementation of a genetic algorithm. Results indicate that the HERPUC is able to solve the set of test problems, to which it has been applied, using fewer fitness evaluations and a smaller population size, than previous hardware-based genetic algorithm implementations...|$|R

40|$|Runtime {{enforcement}} {{techniques are}} {{introduced in the}} literature {{to cope with the}} failures that occur while software is being executed in its target environment. Runtime enforcement techniques contain various concepts that are composed with each other so that the overall functionality of the techniques is achieved. By the term concept we mean a fundamental abstraction or definition that exists in most runtime enforcement techniques. Since the development of runtime enforcement techniques can be complex, runtime enforcement frameworks are proposed to ease the development process. These frameworks offer specification languages to represent the concepts of interest. To facilitate a natural representation of the concepts, this thesis introduces a computation model termed as Event Composition Model, which offers a set of novel linguistic abstractions, called events, event modules, reactors, reactor chains, event composition language and event constraint language. Events represent changes in the states of interest. Event modules are means to group events, have <b>input-output</b> <b>interfaces,</b> and implementations. Reactors are the implementations of event modules. Reactor chains are groups of related reactors that process events in a sequence. The event composition language facilitates selecting the events of interest; and the event constraint language facilitates defining constraints among reactors or event modules. The thesis introduces the EventReactor language as an implementation of Event Composition Model. The language is open-ended for new sorts of events and reactor types. This helps to specify new sorts of concepts. It makes use of the Prolog language as its event composition language. Reactors and reactor chains are parameterizable, and are defined separately from event modules. This increases the reusability of event modules and their implementations. In the EventReactor language, the concepts of interest are represented independently from any programming language, and the compiler of EventReactor supports software developed in Java, C and. Net languages. For distributed software that makes use of Java-RMI as the middleware, the EventReactor language supports distribution-transparent representations of the concepts. There are two basic ways in utilizing the EventReactor language: a) as an underlying language for the specification languages of runtime enforcement frameworks; b) as an implementation language for runtime enforcement techniques. ...|$|R

40|$|Power {{dissipation}} in {{switching devices}} {{is believed to}} be the single most important roadblock to the continued downscaling of charge based electronic circuits. At this time there is a lot of interest in analyzing alternative technologies which could enable further downscaling of electronic circuits. It has also been suggested that magnets as collective entities could require significantly low switching energies. In this thesis we analyze the intrinsic switching energy that is dissipated in the switching process of single-domain magnets. One central result is that the intrinsic switching energy of a magnet (which could be composed of millions of spins) is on the order of its energy barrier height Eb. This is different from conventional transistors in that the switching energy is on the order of NE b, N being the number of electronic charges participating in a switching process (usually on the order of thousands). Furthermore a spintronic device is proposed that uses spin at every stage of its operation: information manipulation, transport, storage, input and output are all accomplished with magnets and spin-coherent channels. Contrary to the typical spin/magnet based logic schemes, the all-spin scheme neither relies on ordinary magnetic fields (generated by current carrying wires) nor does it rely on electrical read-out of magnetic states. Binary data are represented by the bi-stable states of nanomagnets (i. e. magnetic polarization) which can be non-volatile. Application of a voltage signal to a magnetic contact (input data bit) creates a spin-current in a channel which can be conveniently guided and routed to another magnetic contact (output data bit) where it determines its final state based on spin-torque phenomenon. The all-spin device could potentially find use for low-power digital logic since it should satisfy the five essential characteristics for logic applications namely nonlinearity, gain, concatenability, feedback prevention and a complete set of Boolean operations. Moreover it could provide a basis for unconventional approaches. For example the spin accumulation in a channel underneath a magnetic contact could provide a weighted average of different inputs that makes it switch (2 ̆ 7 fire 2 ̆ 7) when it exceeds a threshold like neural networks. Alternatively the magnetic contacts on top of the channel could possibly serve as <b>input-output</b> <b>interface</b> for spin-based quantum computing. ...|$|E

Reservoir {{operation}} certainly provides {{ample opportunity}} to use computer-aided management tools.

Uncertain inflows, reservoir and river dynamics, hydroelectric plant characteristics, flood and drought concerns, water supply, energy generation commitments and economics, water quality standards, recreational activities, local and regional water use conflicts and legislation, and public opinion are {{but a few of the}} parameters influencing reservoir management decisions. Recent reservoir control research advances combined with fascinating developments in the computer industry provide new opportunities for model use in real time reservoir management. Modern reservoir control methods can now handle dimensionally large systems with both multiple objectives and operational constraints. And, of equal importance, control models can now be implemented on readily accessible microcomputers which encourages potential widespread use and numerous practical applications. Combined with interactive <b>input-output</b> graphics <b>interfaces,</b> management models can be designed to maximize user involvement and provide intuitive understanding of the computations in progress.

In a nut shell, the architecture comprises two types of nodes, a computing node and an <b>input-output</b> node, <b>interfaced</b> together through a high-speed network with bus topology. To detect faults in the nodes, a fault management scheme specifically designed to support the cooperative task-oriented distributed computing concept is proposed and employed, which is referred to as Adaptive Middleware for Fault-Tolerance (AMFT). AMFT is implemented as a separate hardware block and operates in parallel with the processing unit within the computing node. A set of metrics is designed and mathematical models of availability and reliability are developed, which are used to evaluate the proposed distributed computing architecture and fault management scheme. As a new development, extending {{the current state of the}} art, the proposed fault-tolerant distributed architecture has been subjected to a rigorous assessment through hardware implementation. Implementation approaches at two levels were adopted to provide a proof of concept: a board level and a Multiprocessor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) level. Both distributed computing system implementations were evaluated for functional validity and performance. To examine the FTDC architecture performance under a realistic space related distributed computing scenario a case-study application, representing a satellite Attitude and Orbit Control System (AOCS), was developed. The AOCS application was selected because it features a time critical task execution, in which system failure and reconfiguration time must be kept minimal. Based on the case-study application, it was demonstrated that the FTDC architecture is capable of fully meeting the desired requirements by timely migrating tasks to functional nodes and keeping rollback of task states minimal, which proves the advantages of the adopted cooperative distributed approach for use on board spacecraft...|$|R
