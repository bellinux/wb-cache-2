50|$|PPV agglutinates human, monkey, guinea pig, cat, chicken, rat, {{and mouse}} erythrocytes. Erythrocytes of {{other kinds of}} animals that have been tested are {{relatively}} or completely insensitive, or {{the results have been}} equivocal. Several parameters of the hemagglutination (HA) test—such as the temperature of incubation, the species of erythrocyte used, {{and in the case of}} chicken erythrocytes the genetic composition and age of the donor—may quantitatively affect results. The <b>HA</b> <b>test</b> is most commonly conducted at room temperature, at approximately neutral pH, and with guinea pig erythrocytes. Higher HA titers have been recorded when the diluent used in the test was veronal buffer rather than phosphate-buffered saline. Elution of virus (the hemagglutinin is part of the virion) can be induced by suspending erythrocytes in alkaline buffer, pH 9.|$|E
40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarAccording to the {{specifications}} of the European Pharmacopoeia (EP) monograph on Tetanus vaccine {{for veterinary use}} (EP 1990) potency testing is based either on immunization and bleeding of guinea-pigs or rabbits, followed by estimation of the antitoxin titre by toxin neutralization assay (TN test) in mice (Method A) or on immunization and challenge of mice (Method B). Recently in vitro serological assay systems {{have been described as}} potential alternatives to the TN test. These include Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), Toxin Binding Inhibition (ToBI) test, Haemagglutination (<b>HA)</b> <b>test</b> and modifications of these procedures such as antigen capture ELISA and antigen competition ELISA. An interlaboratory validation study was initiated to evaluate the suitability of the in vitro serological methods to provide valid and reproducible measurements of the biological potency by Method A of the EP. This report presents the results of this study. Intra- and interlaboratory variation was acceptable for ELISA and ToBI test, but large variation was seen in the <b>HA</b> <b>test.</b> Estimates of potency obtained by TN test and by in vitro test systems were in good agreement {{for a wide range of}} products and a wide range of antitoxin titres. It is concluded that the TN test for the estimation of potency of tetanus toxoid vaccines for veterinary use according to Method A of the EP can be replaced by ELISA or ToBI test. Standardization of <b>HA</b> <b>test</b> is required before this test can be used for quality control purposes...|$|E

40|$|Human pythiosis is an emerging, {{life-threatening}} infectious disease, {{caused by}} the oomycete Pythium insidiosum. Thailand {{is an area where}} human pythiosis is endemic and the genetic blood disorder thalassemia is a predisposing factor. Patients with pythiosis present with arterial occlusions of the lower extremities, corneal ulcers, or chronic cutaneous infections. Diagnosis relies on time-consuming, relatively insensitive tests such as culture identification and immunodiffusion assay. Most patients undergo surgical removal of infected organs, and many die from the infection. Delayed diagnosis results in a poor prognosis. Here, we describe a hemagglutination (<b>HA)</b> <b>test</b> for rapid diagnosis of human pythiosis. Sheep red blood cells were coated with P. insidiosum protein extract and used in duplicated detection assays using serum samples from 33 patients with vascular (n = 27), cutaneous (n = 2), or ocular (n = 4) pythiosis and serum samples from 289 control patients with other infectious diseases (n = 77), with highly positive antinuclear antibody (n = 5), with thalassemia (n = 21), or with no known disorder (i. e., healthy blood donors) (n = 186). Based on receiver-operating characteristic analysis, a serum titer of 1 : 160 was selected as the cutoff point for the <b>HA</b> <b>test.</b> Serum samples that generated HA at the cutoff titer were read as positive, while samples that did not were read as negative. Positive results were obtained with the serum samples of all patients with vascular and cutaneous pythiosis and with two serum samples from the control group. Negative results were obtained with serum samples from all ocular pythiosis patients and the 287 remaining serum samples from the control group. Sensitivity and specificity of the HA were 88 % and 99 %, respectively. In conclusion, the <b>HA</b> <b>test</b> for detection of anti-Pythium antibodies is a simple, rapid, and reliable test for serodiagnosis of vascular and cutaneous pythiosis...|$|E

Samples were collected from intestine, intestine contained and mucose, as well as dogs feses from diarrhoea and blood diarrhoea.

The presence of CPE indicated that there was viral isolate and continued to further identification using Haemaglutination (<b>HA)</b> <b>test</b> with pig red blood cells.

Nine isolates were obtained from feces and 1 isolate was obtained from Mucose intestine from bloody diarrhoea dogs. Those isolates were also obtained from 1 to 2 days post blood diarrhea clinical signs. Two from 10 cadavers examined showed histological changes to CPV infection.
