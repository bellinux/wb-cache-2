Thorne-Zytkow objects are expected to look like extreme M-type supergiants, assuming that they can avoid a runaway neutrino instability. Accretion onto the embedded neutron star will produce either an isolated, spun-up neutron star (possibly a short-period pulsar) or a black hole.

40|$|Abstract. Pulsar {{astronomy}} {{is currently}} enjoying {{one of the}} most productive phases in its history. In this review, I outline some of the basic observational aspects and summarise some of the latest results of searches for pulsars in the disk of our Galaxy and its globular cluster system. 1. Preamble Pulsar astronomy began serendipitously in 1967 when Jocelyn Bell and Antony Hewish discovered periodic signals originating from distinct parts of the sky via pen-chart recordings taken during an interplanetary scintillation survey of the radio sky at 81. 5 MHz (Hewish et al. 1968). This remarkable phenomenon has since been unequivocally linked with the radiation produced by a rotating neutron star (Gold 1968, Pacini 1968). Baade & Zwicky (1934) were the first to hypothesise the existence of neutron stars as a stable configuration of <b>degenerate</b> <b>neutrons</b> formed from the collapsed remains of a massive star after it has exploded as a supernova. Although the theory of pulsar emission is complex, the basic idea ca...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the astrophysical reaction rates for radiative neutron capture reactions (n,γ) in the crust of a neutron star. The presence of <b>degenerate</b> <b>neutrons</b> at high densities (mainly {{in the inner}} crust) can drastically affect the reaction rates. Standard rates assuming a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for neutrons can underestimate the rates by several orders of magnitude. We derive simple analytical expressions for reaction rates {{at a variety of}} conditions with account for neutron degeneracy. We also discuss the plasma effects on the outgoing radiative transition channel in neutron radiative capture reactions and show that these effects can also increase the reaction rates by a few orders of magnitude. In addition, using detailed balance, we analyze the effects of neutron degeneracy and plasma physics on reverse (γ,n) photodisintegration. We discuss the dependence of the reaction rates on temperature and neutron chemical potential and outline the efficiency of these reactions in the neutron star crust.

50|$|<b>Neutrons</b> in a <b>degenerate</b> <b>neutron</b> gas are spaced {{much more}} closely than {{electrons}} in an electron-degenerate gas because the more massive neutron has a much shorter wavelength at a given energy. Typical separations are comparable {{with the size of}} the neutron and the range of the strong nuclear force and it is actually the repulsive nature of the latter at small separations that primarily supports neutron stars more massive than 0.7 solar masses (which includes all measured neutron stars). In the case of neutron stars and white dwarf stars, this is {{compounded by the fact that}} the <b>pressures</b> within <b>neutron</b> stars are much higher than those in white dwarfs. The pressure increase is caused by the fact that the compactness of a neutron star causes gravitational forces to be much higher than in a less compact body with similar mass. This results in a star with a diameter on the order of a thousandth that of a white dwarf.|$|R
40|$|Current {{neutron star}} {{theories}} use a two-component {{model of the}} star interior, which is believed to consist of a <b>degenerate</b> <b>neutron</b> superfluid core surrounded by a rigid crust of iron nuclei {{in a sea of}} free electrons. At the extremely high densities {{near the center of the}} star (10 11 to 10 15 g/cm 3), the characteristics of the matter are largely unknown. We have created several models of the neutron star interior employing different equations of state in order to place restrictions on the possible equations of state of the matter. We have been able to set limits on the mass, radius, and central density from these models. We have also been able to discredit one of the models as unrealistic due to observational constraints on the mass. It is also possible to use the model parameters, particularly the crust parameters, to determine the feasibility of the starquake model as the mechanism by which some pulsars exhibit glitches, which are sudden spin-ups in a pulsar's extremely stead [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Exotic {{examples}} of <b>degenerate</b> matter include <b>neutron</b> <b>degenerate</b> matter, strange matter, metallic hydrogen and white dwarf matter. Degeneracy pressure {{contributes to the}} pressure of conventional solids, {{but these are not}} usually considered to be degenerate matter because a significant contribution to their pressure is provided by electrical repulsion of atomic nuclei and the screening of nuclei from each other by electrons. In metals it is useful to treat the conduction electrons alone as a degenerate, free electron gas while the majority of the electrons are regarded as occupying bound quantum states. This contrasts with degenerate matter that forms the body of a white dwarf, where all the electrons would be treated as occupying free particle momentum states.|$|R
40|$|What {{happens to}} a neutron star or white dwarf near its maximum mass limit when it is brought into a close binary orbit with a companion? Such {{situation}} may occur in the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae and in coalescing neutron star binaries. Using an energy variational principle, we show that tidal field reduces the central density of the compact object, making it more stable against radial collapse. For a cold white dwarf, the tidal field increases the maximum stable mass only slightly, but can actually lower the maximum central density {{by as much as}} 30 %. Thus a white dwarf in a close binary may be more susceptible to general relativistic instability than the instability associated with electron capture and pycronuclear reaction (depending on the white dwarf composition). We analyse the radial stability of neutron star using post-Newtonian approximation with an ideal <b>degenerate</b> <b>neutron</b> gas equation of state. The tidal stablization effect implies that the neutron star in coalescing neutron star-neutron star or neutron star-black hole binaries does not collapse prior to merger or tidal disruption.

40|$|The beta {{relaxation}} {{time of the}} <b>degenerate</b> <b>neutron</b> star cores, composed of neutrons, protons and electrons, is evaluated {{taking into account the}} superfluidity of nucleons. We calculate the implied reduction factors for both direct and modified Urca reactions, with isotropic pairing of the protons or anisotropic pairing of neutrons. We find that due to the non-zero value of the temperature and/or to the vanishing of anisotropic gaps in some directions of the phase-space, superfluidity does not always completely inhibit beta relaxation, allowing for some reactions if the superfluid gap amplitude is not too large in respect to both the typical thermal energy and the chemical potential mismatch. However, we also observe that if the ratio between the critical temperature and the actual temperature is very small, a suprathermal regime is reached for which superfluidity is almost irrelevant. On the contrary, if the gap is large enough, the composition of the nuclear matter can stay frozen for very long durations, unless the departure from beta equilibrium is at least as important as the gap amplitude. These results are crucial for precise estimation of the superfluidity effect on the cooling/slowing-down of pulsars, which we will study elsewhere...|$|R

40|$|A {{new type}} of stellar model is constructed. It is related to neutron stars as {{ordinary}} red giants are related to white dwarfs. Its external appearance {{is similar to that}} of an ordinary M supergiant, but its evolutionary lifetime is 10 times longer. Our models are constrained to be relativistic but nonrotating, to constrain a <b>degenerate</b> <b>neutron</b> core of mass 1 M⊙ and radius 10 km, surrounded by a nondegenerate, massive, diffuse envelope. The core and envelope turn out to be separated by a thin (40 m) energy-generation layer. The envelope convects from this layer all the way out to the photosphere. The effective temperatures and radii are 2700 K and 1000 R⊙. Within a fairly narrow range of effective temperatures and radii, two families of models were found: "red giants" and "red supergiants" with luminosities and masses less than and greater than 65, 000 L⊙ and 10 M⊙, respectively. The luminosity of a giant comes 97 percent from gravitational contraction and 3 percent from nuclear burning. That of a supergiant is 5 percent from gravitational contraction and 95 percent from hydrogen burning by nonequilibrium, hot CNO reactions. The CNO reaction products are convected directly from the hydrogen-burning shell out to the photosphere of the supergiant, where they should be observable...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contains}} {{the results of}} two investigations: one {{into the nature of}} stars with <b>degenerate</b> <b>neutron</b> cores and the other into the interpretation of the phenomenology of luminous low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) displaying slow quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in their X-ray flux. A star with a <b>degenerate</b> <b>neutron</b> core would be a red giant or supergiant. In this thesis we investigate the structure of such a supergiant, particularly examining the energy production and seeking an identifying observational signature. This star is convective from near the photosphere down {{to the base of the}} envelope just outside the degenerate core (radius 10 km). The star's luminosity comes from the rp-process in a convective burning region within 100 km of the base of the envelope. The convection brings fuel for the rp-process into the burning region from throughout the envelope and deposits the products of rp-burning back into the envelope, including the photosphere. After about 10 ^ 5 years, the abundances of Br, Rb, Y, and Nb at the surface of the star will be about 200 times greater than their solar abundances, and that of Mo, over 1000 times solar. A suitable observational signature would be the strong enhancement of absorption lines for these elements in the star's spectrum. As many as 10 of the nearest 100 red supergiants (those within 5 kpc) could have neutron cores. The other investigation concerns a model of rapid accretion onto an unmagnetized neutron star with radius somewhat less than 6 GM/c^ 2. This model is applied to the phenomenology of a class of LMXBs displaying slow (∼ 6 Hz) QPOs in X-ray flux. These sources are highly luminous (approximately Eddington) and display what appears to be three modes ("branches") of accretion. In this model, at low accretion rates, the neutron star lies within the inner edge of the accretion disk, and matter is dripped onto the neutron star from the inner edge. As the accretion rate increases, the transition from the "horizontal branch" to the "normal branch" occurs when the disk thickens and its inner edge touches the star and forms a boundary layer. The formation of a boundary layer changes the structure of the inner disk and the spectral character of the escaping X-rays. The transition from the normal branch to the "flaring branch" occurs when the boundary layer covers the whole surface of the neutron star and radiation escapes primarily through convective instabilities. This thesis presents an exploration of this model, with an emphasis on establishing the plausibility that a neutron star could indeed lie inside an accretion disk accreting at the observed rate and that a change of mass accretion rate could push the inner radius onto the surface of the star. ...|$|R
40|$|The Chandrasekhar {{limit for}} quark stars is {{evaluated}} from simple energy balance relations, {{as proposed by}} Landau for white dwarfs or neutron stars. It {{has been found that}} the limit for quark stars depends on, in addition to the fundamental constants, the Bag constant. Compact objects like the white dwarfs and neutron stars have been a topic of interest for several decades. These objects are produced as the end product of the stellar evolution, i. e., when the nuclear fuel of the normal stars have been consumed. White dwarfs are supported against gravitational collapse by the degeneracy pressure of electrons whereas for <b>neutron</b> stars, this <b>pressure</b> comes mainly from the <b>degenerate</b> <b>neutrons.</b> It is well known that both these classes of collapsed stars have a maximum mass (∼ 1. 5 M ⊙), beyond which they collapse to black holes [1, 2, 3]. Although the Chandrasekhar limit refers strictly to white dwarfs, the limiting mass for neutron stars is also loosely called the Chandrasekhar limit, primarily because the limits in the two cases {{turn out to be the}} same [2]. The underlying quark structure of the nucleons suggests a possible hadron- quark phase transition at high density and/or temperature. This, in turn, implies the possible existence of another kind of compact objects, namely quark stars [4, 5, 6]. The suggestion of Witten[7] that the strange quark matter may be the true ground state of the strongly interacting matter started a new era in this subject. In this circumstance, quark stars, if they are formed, would preferably convert to strange stars, comprising u, d and s quarks, under weak interaction. Several authors (for example, [8, 9]) have used different models to understand the properties of strange stars. For a review, see [6]. The unique feature of strange stars, which separates them from other compact objects, is that these need not be the direct product of stellar evolution. These are most likely to be produced due to the hadron quark phas...|$|R

In this paper, previous ideal-magnetohydrodynamic models of isothermal mountains are generalized {{to a range of}} physically motivated, adiabatic equations of state. It is found that the mass ellipticity drops substantially, from ϵ 3 e- 4 (isothermal) to ϵ 9 e- 7 (non-relativistic <b>degenerate</b> <b>neutrons),</b> 6 e- 8 (relativistic degenerate electrons) and 1 e- 8 (non-relativistic degenerate electrons) (assuming a magnetic field of 3 e 12 G at birth).

Similar results are obtained for a realistic, piecewise-polytropic nuclear equation of state. The adiabatic models are consistent with current LIGO upper limits, unlike the isothermal models. Updated estimates of gravitational-wave detectability are made. Monte Carlo simulations of the spin distribution of accreting millisecond pulsars including gravitational-wave stalling agree better with observations for certain adiabatic equations of state, implying that X-ray spin measurements can probe the equation of state when coupled with magnetic mountain models.
