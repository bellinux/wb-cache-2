5|$|In {{contrast}} to DNA damage, a mutation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> {{in the base}} sequence of the DNA. A mutation cannot be recognized by enzymes once the base change is present in both DNA strands, and thus a mutation cannot be repaired. At the cellular level, mutations can cause alterations in protein function and regulation. Mutations are replicated when the cell replicates. In a population of cells, mutant cells will increase or decrease in frequency according {{to the effects of}} the mutation on the ability of the cell to survive and reproduce.|$|E
5|$|Blood free {{thyroxine}} and TSH {{levels are}} monitored {{to help determine}} whether the dose is adequate. This is done 4–8 weeks {{after the start of}} treatment or a change in levothyroxine dose. Once the adequate replacement dose has been established, the tests can be repeated after 6 and then 12 months, unless there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> in symptoms. In people with central/secondary hypothyroidism, TSH is not a reliable marker of hormone replacement and decisions are based mainly on the free T4 level. Levothyroxine is best taken 30–60 minutes before breakfast, or four hours after food, as certain substances such as food and calcium can inhibit the absorption of levothyroxine. There is no direct way of increasing thyroid hormone secretion by the thyroid gland.|$|E
5|$|Cancer <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> in the {{cellular}} processes that cause a tumour to {{grow out of}} control. Cancerous cells sometimes have mutations in oncogenes, such as KRAS and CTNNB1 (β-catenin). Analysing the molecular signature of cancerous cellsthe DNA and its levels of expression via messenger RNAenables physicians to characterise the cancer and to choose the best therapy for their patients. As of 2010, assays that incorporate an array of antibodies against specific protein marker molecules are an emerging technology; there are hopes for these multiplex assays that could measure many markers at once. Other potential future biomarkers include micro RNA molecules, which cancerous cells express more of than healthy ones.|$|E

25|$|In thermodynamics, an {{adiabatic}} process <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> that occurs without heat flow, and slowly {{compared to the}} time to reach equilibrium. In an {{adiabatic process}}, the system is in equilibrium at all stages. Under these conditions, the entropy is constant.|$|E

25|$|The most general {{definition}} {{of climate change}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> in the statistical properties (principally its mean and spread) of the climate system when considered {{over long periods of}} time, regardless of cause. Accordingly, fluctuations over periods shorter than a few decades, such as El Niño, do not represent climate change.|$|E
25|$|Change to attacking formations. When {{chasing a}} game for a {{desirable}} result, teams tend to sacrifice a defensive player or a midfield player for a forward in order to chase a result. An {{example of such a}} change <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> from 4–5–1 to 4–4–2, 3–5–2 to 3–4–3, or even 5–3–2 to 4–3–3.|$|E
25|$|A single-nucleotide {{polymorphism}} (SNP) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> to {{a single}} nucleotide in a DNA sequence. Typical Y-DNA SNP tests test about 20,000 to 35,000 SNPs.

It is often due to the scission of polymer chain bonds via hydrolysis, leading to a decrease in the molecular mass of the polymer.|$|E
25|$|Aberration {{should not}} be {{confused}} with parallax. The latter <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> in the apparent position of a relatively nearby object, as measured by a moving observer, relative to more distant objects that define a reference frame. The amount of parallax depends on the distance of the object from the observer, whereas aberration does not. Aberration is also related to light-time correction and relativistic beaming, although it is often considered separately from these effects.|$|E
