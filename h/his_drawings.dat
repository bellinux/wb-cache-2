5|$|Construction of Selfe's {{version of}} the Sydney harbour bridge never started due to an {{economic}} slowdown and a change of government at the 1904 state election. Much to Selfe's outrage, the Department of Public Works kept his calculations and drawings, and also copied and printed them. Eventually in 1907, the department contacted Selfe {{and asked him to}} collect <b>his</b> <b>drawings,</b> but refused to return the calculations. Selfe was never given the £1,100 prize, nor was he paid for his subsequent work which he estimated to be worth more than £20,000.|$|E

50|$|In 1813 he {{published}} {{a series of}} ‘Views of the Neighbourhood of Windsor, &c.,’ with engravings by others from <b>his</b> own <b>drawings.</b> In 1816-17 he travelled in Italy, and on his return published in parts ‘A Picturesque Tour of Italy,’ in which some of <b>his</b> own <b>drawings</b> were finished into pictures for engraving by J. M. W. Turner. In 1820-1 he visited Jamaica, and subsequently published ‘A Picturesque Tour in the Island of Jamaica,’ from <b>his</b> own <b>drawings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Two of <b>his</b> many master <b>drawings,</b> <b>his</b> gift {{during a}} visit to Yugoslavia, are kept in the Syrmia Museum in Sremska Mitrovica.

5|$|Forty-eight Non-Indian people visited Yosemite Valley in 1855, {{including}} San Francisco writer James Mason Hutchings {{and artist}} Thomas Ayres. Hutchings {{wrote an article}} about his experience that {{was published in the}} July 12, 1855, issue of the Mariposa Gazette and Ayres' sketch of Yosemite Falls was published in late 1855; four of <b>his</b> <b>drawings</b> were presented in the lead article of the July 1856 and initial issue of Hutchings' Illustrated California Magazine. The article and illustrations created tourist interest in Yosemite and eventually led to its protection.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-1870s Busch's {{illustrations}} {{were printed}} using zincography. With this technique {{there was no}} longer any danger that a wood engraver could change the character of <b>his</b> <b>drawings.</b> The originals were photographed and transferred onto a photosensitive zinc plate. This process allowed for the application of a clear, free pen-drawn ink line, and was a much faster printing method. Busch's use of zincography began with Mr. and Mrs. Knopp.|$|E
5|$|His {{scholarly}} {{writing as}} an Aesthetic Realism consultant showing {{the relation of}} art and life includes considerations of the lives and works of sculptors Augustus Saint-Gaudens and Jacques Lipchitz; painters René Magritte, Giorgio de Chirico, Henri Matisse, Rembrandt, Fernand Léger, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Masaccio; and many American printmakers. He {{is the author of}} The Art of the Print, essays on works of Picasso, Daumier, Munch, Hogarth, and Duane Hanson. <b>His</b> <b>drawings</b> illustrate Siegel's book, Damned Welcome: Aesthetic Realism Maxims (New York: Definition Press, 1972, 2011).|$|E

5|$|In 1855, {{entrepreneur}} James Mason Hutchings, artist Thomas Ayres and {{two others}} {{were the first to}} tour the area. Hutchings and Ayres were responsible for much of the earliest publicity about Yosemite, writing articles and special magazine issues about the Valley. Ayres' style in art was highly detailed with exaggerated angularity. His works and written accounts were distributed nationally, and an art exhibition of <b>his</b> <b>drawings</b> was held in New York City. Hutchings' publicity efforts between 1855 and 1860 led to an increase in tourism to Yosemite.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo also closely {{observed}} and recorded {{the effects of}} age and of human emotion on the physiology, studying in particular the effects of rage. He drew many figures who had significant facial deformities or signs of illness. Leonardo also studied and drew the anatomy of many animals, dissecting cows, birds, monkeys, bears, and frogs, and comparing in <b>his</b> <b>drawings</b> their anatomical structure with that of humans. He also {{made a number of}} studies of horses.|$|E
5|$|The Simpson {{family first}} {{appeared}} as shorts in The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987.

However, the animators merely re-traced <b>his</b> <b>drawings,</b> {{which led to the}} crude appearance of the characters in the initial shorts. The animation was produced domestically at Klasky Csupo, with Wes Archer, David Silverman, and Bill Kopp being animators for the first season. Colorist Gyorgyi Peluce was the person who decided to make the characters yellow.|$|E

5|$|The {{popularity}} of Rodin's most famous sculptures tends to obscure his total creative output. A prolific artist, he created thousands of busts, figures, and sculptural fragments {{over more than}} five decades. He painted in oils (especially in his thirties) and in watercolors. The Musée Rodin holds 7,000 of <b>his</b> <b>drawings</b> and prints, in chalk and charcoal, and thirteen vigorous drypoints. He also produced a single lithograph.|$|E
5|$|After the Franks {{were driven}} from the Holy Land in 1291, European {{familiarity}} with the castles of the Crusades declined. It {{was not until the}} 19thcentury that interest in these buildings was renewed, so there are no detailed plans from before 1837. Guillaume Rey was the first European researcher to scientifically study Crusader castles in the Holy Land. In 1871 he published the work Etudes sur les monuments de l'architecture militaire des Croisés en Syrie et dans l'ile de Chypre; it included plans and drawings of the major Crusader castles in Syria, including Krak des Chevaliers. In some instances <b>his</b> <b>drawings</b> were inaccurate, however for Krak des Chavaliers they record features which have since been lost.|$|E
5|$|Despite this protest, {{two sets}} of {{illustrations}} for Candide were produced by the French artist Jean-Michel Moreau le Jeune. The first version was done, at Moreau's own expense, in 1787 and included in Kehl's publication of that year, Oeuvres Complètes de Voltaire. Four images were drawn by Moreau for this edition and were engraved by Pierre-Charles Baquoy. The second version, in 1803, consisted of seven drawings by Moreau which were transposed by multiple engravers. The twentieth-century modern artist Paul Klee stated that it was while reading Candide that he discovered his own artistic style. Klee illustrated the work, and <b>his</b> <b>drawings</b> were published in a 1920 version edited by Kurt Wolff.|$|E

5|$|Caragiale {{continued}} to be hailed as a relevant writer during the ten years following his death, and his wors went through new critical editions. Pajere was published in spring 1936, having been edited by Marica Caragiale-Sion and Alexandru Rosetti. Later in the year, a volume of collected works, Opere, was published by Rosetti and featured prints made by Mateiu Caragiale at various moments during his lifetime. Large portions of the diaries kept by Mateiu Caragiale are lost. The transcript made by Perpessicius was criticized for having selectively discarded much content, while originals kept by Rosetti were mysteriously lost during the Legionnaires' Rebellion of 1941. Additional notes, which notably featured Caragiale's criticism of his father, were preserved for a while by Șerban Cioculescu, before being borrowed to Ecaterina Logadi, Ion Luca's daughter, and never recovered. A significant number of <b>his</b> <b>drawings</b> and paintings, which Vianu assumed had survived by 1936, have also been misplaced.|$|E
5|$|Fox {{negotiated}} a deal which would prove extremely lucrative for Groening, {{in which he}} retained {{a large portion of}} revenue from merchandising. To animate the short segments, Brooks and company settled on Klasky Csupo, a small animation house who offered to produce the cartoons cheaply. Brooks initially just wanted to animate the shorts through the basic line drawings, and Klasky-Csupo offered color for the same cost. The studio only employed three young animators—CalArts graduates Bill Kopp, Wes Archer, and David Silverman—who adapted Groening's scripts for animation in one week, doing layouts, animation and inbetweening by hand in the very short amount of time. Groening submitted only basic sketches to the three, and assumed that the figures would be cleaned-up in production. However, the animators merely re-traced <b>his</b> <b>drawings,</b> which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial short episodes. Colorist Gyorgyi Peluce was the person who decided to make the characters yellow.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, {{again at}} the {{invitation}} of the Prince of Wales, he joined HMS Serapis, which conducted the Prince on an official tour of India, 1875–76. Louis sketched some of the events of the tour and <b>his</b> <b>drawings</b> were published in the Illustrated London News. He was promoted to lieutenant on 15 May 1876. The Prince asked Louis to stay with him at Marlborough House for the summer of 1876, but wishing to gain further experience at sea, Louis instead accepted an offer to join Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, as a lieutenant on board HMS Sultan. In addition to acting as the Duke's equerry, Louis continued his naval duties. He did not enjoy the position, as the Duke was rather touchy and Louis's cabin was infested with rats, one of which he caught with his bare hands as it ran across his chest as he lay in bed. The Sultan toured the Mediterranean from July 1876.|$|E

5|$|In 1920, {{while still}} {{attending}} high school, Cooper took three art courses at Montana Agricultural College in Bozeman. His interest in art was inspired years earlier by the Western paintings of Charles Marion Russell and Frederic Remington. Cooper especially admired and studied Russell's Lewis and Clark Meeting Indians at Ross' Hole (1910), which still {{hangs in the}} state capitol building in Helena. In 1922, Cooper enrolled in Grinnell College in Iowa to continue his art education. Cooper did well academically in most of his courses, but was not accepted to the school's drama club. <b>His</b> <b>drawings</b> and watercolors were exhibited throughout the dormitory, and he was named art editor for the college yearbook. During the summers of 1922 and 1923, Cooper worked at Yellowstone National Park as a tour guide driving the yellow open-top buses. Despite a promising first eighteen months at Grinnell, he left college suddenly in February 1924, spent a month in Chicago looking for work as an artist, {{and then returned to}} Helena, where he sold editorial cartoons to the Independent, a local newspaper.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, Virginia Weddell hired {{architect}} William Lawrence Bottomley {{and purchased}} antique stone columns from the Spanish Duke of the Infantado to reconstruct an ancient Spanish loggia {{on the southwest}} elevation of the house. Bottomley was able to incorporate the existing parapets, finials and pierced railings and posts from the north library bay windows into the loggia design, with a ceiling reconstructed from a sixteenth-century house {{on the grounds of}} a manor in Knole, Kent, England. Wall tiles were used which indicated use of gunpowder on the original property. Bottomley, however, was quite critical of his own work and believed his loggia was too symmetrical and lacking in the quality of picturesqueness and romance {{that the rest of the}} house displayed and proposed an octagonal stairway be added on the outside corner. However, his idea was rejected by the Weddells, and the loggia was completed without the staircase in 1946. Bottomley was paid $10,764 and received a ten percent commission for <b>his</b> <b>drawings</b> and construction.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} of unmistakable Turkish danger and the fall of Bosnia under Turkish rule, a {{detached}} fortress providing additional protection to the land approach to the eastern Ploče Gate was built {{to the east of}} the city in 1462. The name Revelin derives from rivelino (ravelin), a term in military architecture which refers to work built opposite the city gate in order to afford better protection from enemy attack. Danger of Venetian assault suddenly increased in the times of the First Holy League, and it was necessary to strengthen this vulnerable point of the city fortifications. The Senate hired Antonio Ferramolino, an experienced builder of fortresses {{in the service of the}} Spanish admiral Doria, a trusted friend of the Republic. In 1538 the Senate approved <b>his</b> <b>drawings</b> of the new, much stronger Revelin Fortress. It took 11 years to build it, and during that time all other construction work in the city had stopped in order to finish this fortress as soon as possible.|$|E
