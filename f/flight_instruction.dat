5|$|The son of William and Ida Steege, Gordon Henry Steege {{was born}} in the Sydney suburb of Chatswood on 31October 1917, and educated at North Sydney Boys High School.

On 21July 1937, he joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), undergoing <b>flight</b> <b>instruction</b> at No.1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria. He graduated with a distinguished pass on 23June 1938, and was commissioned a pilot officer. His first posting was to No.3 (Army Cooperation) Squadron at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, flying Hawker Demon biplane fighters. Steege and the squadron participated in several exercises with the Australian Army, undertaking reconnaissance, spotting for artillery, and practising ground-attack missions. He was promoted to flying officer in December 1938.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} it was re-formed as No.1 AFTS, the flying school at Point Cook had also been made {{responsible}} for training the RAAF's air traffic controllers; this role was transferred to Central Flying School at East Sale in December 1956. Southern Area Command was re-formed as Training Command in September 1953. On 28May 1958, No.1 AFTS relocated to RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia, where its Wirraways were replaced by deHavilland Vampire jet trainers, which required a runway longer than that at Point Cook. The school's place at Point Cook was taken by No.1 BFTS, which transferred from Uranquinty on 19December. By this time the RAAF had decided to commission all pilots and navigators, who would be selected for these roles upon induction into the service; navigators therefore went straight to the School of Air Navigation at East Sale, without attending flying training school. On 31December 1958, the Flying Training Squadron of RAAF College was disbanded, and the <b>flight</b> <b>instruction</b> component of the four-year cadet course became the responsibility of No.1 BFTS (for basic training) and No.1 AFTS (for advanced training). Previously, the cadets had used FTS aircraft under RAAF College instructors, but from 1959 their flight training was fully integrated with the FTS system.|$|E
