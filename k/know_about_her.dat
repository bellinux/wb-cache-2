5|$|Murasaki {{began her}} diary after she entered service at Shōshi's court. Much {{of what we}} <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> and her {{experiences}} at court comes from the diary, which covers the period from about 1008 to 1010. The long descriptive passages, {{some of which may}} have originated as letters, cover her relationships with the other ladies-in-waiting, Michinaga's temperament, the birth of Shōshi's sons—at Michinaga's mansion rather than at the Imperial Palace—and the process of writing Genji, including descriptions of passing newly written chapters to calligraphers for transcriptions. Typical of contemporary court diaries written to honor patrons, Murasaki devotes half to the birth of Shōshi's son Emperor Go-Ichijō, an event of enormous importance to Michinaga: he had planned for it with his daughter's marriage which made him grandfather and de facto regent to an emperor.|$|E
