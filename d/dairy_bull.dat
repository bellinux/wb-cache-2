5000|$|Cattle only produce milk after calving, and {{so every}} dairy cow must produce a calf every year. In dairy herds (which in the British Isles are almost all Holstein-Friesians), the best milking cows will {{normally}} be bred to a <b>dairy</b> <b>bull,</b> usually by artificial insemination (AI). The female purebred dairy calves from these matings {{will go on}} to become replacement dairy cows. Half of the purebred calves will, of course, be male [...] - [...] these are mostly not needed for breeding, and are generally unsuitable for beef; they may be reared for veal or are killed and disposed of at a few days old, depending on economics. Purebred dairy calves are not needed {{from the rest of the}} herd, and a beef bull is run with the remaining females to produce crossbred calves suitable for beef [...] - [...] these females will be the poorer-quality cows, the heifers (first-time calvers), and any of the other cows which have not settled (become pregnant) successfully by a bull. The beef bull in this system may be of almost any beef breed, but the Hereford is one of the most widely used [...] - [...] one reason for its popularity is that the white face from the Hereford makes it very easy to avoid confusion between the crossbred and purebred calves at birth.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of hedonic pricing to {{identify}} the value of relevant production and type traits for <b>dairy</b> <b>bulls</b> in Alberta. A hedonic pricing model is estimated that models semen price {{as a function of}} individual production and longevity characteristics for a sample of Holstein bulls. This model corrects for sources of statistical bias in the data (i. e., censored data and endogenous supply problems). The results suggest that the most important characteristics in valuing <b>dairy</b> <b>bulls</b> are milk volume, protein and fat content, general conformation, body capacity, the popularity of the bull, and the probability that the bull's semen may be in short supply. This methodology may be used to establish a method of forecasting semen prices for newly proven bulls. The valuation procedure may be easily updated and adjusted as producers' breeding objectives change over time due to the changing economic environment. Further extensions of this method may be done to incorporate other characteristics and/or to assess shifts in producer breeding objectives over time. The results of this analysis suggest that hedonic pricing may be a superior method of placing a value on production and type characteristics for <b>dairy</b> <b>bulls</b> than the Lifetime Profit Index, currently being used by the Canadian dairy industry.

At <b>Dairy</b> <b>Bull</b> reef, {{with low}} macroalgal cover (8 % in 2002 falling to 1 % in 2015) and {{significant}} number of Diadema antillarum urchins (c. 5 m− 2), live coral cover increased from 13 % ± 5 % in 2006 after the bleaching event in 2005, to 31 % ± 7 % in 2008, while live Acropora cervicornis increased from 2 % ± 2 % in 2006 to 28 % ± 5 % in 2015. Coral cover levels were at least maintained until 2015, owing mostly to {{a slight increase in}} A. cervicornis. Dancing Lady reef however was dominated by macroalgae throughout this period (cover of c. 76 % ± 7 %), with no D. antillarum and showed little decrease in the already low (6 % ± 1 %) coral cover in 2005. Growth rates for Siderastrea siderea were similar for both sites (7 mm∙yr− 1), while growth rates of A. cervicornis and A. palmata were 120. 0 ± 30 mm∙yr− 1 and 71. 0 ± 29 mm∙yr− 1 respectively at <b>Dairy</b> <b>Bull</b> in 2015.

We compare these proportions to the proportion of variance in DTDs explained by the additive relationship matrix derived from the pedigree, {{as well as the}} sum of variance explained by both pedigree and marker information when these were fitted simultaneously. The propor- tion of genetic variance in DTDs relative to the total genetic variance (the total genetic variance explained by the genomic relationships and pedigree relationships when both were fitted simultaneously) varied from 32 % for fertility to approximately 80 % for milk yield traits. When fitting genomic and pedigree relationships simultaneously, the variance unexplained (i. e. the residual variance) in DTDs of the total variance for most traits was reduced compared to fitting either individually, suggesting that there is not complete overlap between the effects. The proportion of genetic variance accounted by the genomic relationships can be used to modify the blending equations used to calculate genomic estimated breeding value (GEBV) from direct genomic breeding value (DGV) and parent average.
