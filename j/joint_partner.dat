5|$|Commerce Square {{was part}} of an office-building boom {{that took place in the}} late 1980s in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. During the boom {{numerous}} skyscrapers were constructed in the West Market Street neighborhood of Center City. The US$300 million development of Commerce Square was led by Robert F. Maguire III, co-managing partner of Maguire Thomas Partners of Los Angeles. To get his project moving, Maguire engaged the architectural firm IM Pei & Partners (now called Pei Cobb Freed & Partners) to design the complex. Using a design by a leading architectural firm as incentive, Maguire approached IBM, a company he had past associations with. By early November 1984, after negotiations with Maguire, IBM agreed to be a <b>joint</b> <b>partner</b> in the development. IBM also agreed to serve as the lead tenant for One Commerce Square, occupying about half the building as its headquarters for the Mid-Atlantic region. Commerce Square would be split between two buildings, One Commerce Square being built first, and the second tower, Two Commerce Square, being built later once a lead tenant was secured. Plans for Commerce Square were officially announced on November 16, 1984 at a press conference held by Maguire and IBM at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel. The first phase of the project included One Commerce Square, retail and restaurant space, a plaza, and an underground parking garage. Construction began with the first phase on June 10, 1985. One Commerce Square was topped off with a ceremony on June 6, 1986, and the skyscraper officially opened on October 23, 1987.|$|E

40|$|The {{temporomandibular}} joint (TMJ) is a synovial joint. Two bony <b>joint</b> <b>partners</b> {{are covered}} with articular cartilage. The joint is enclosed in a joint capsule. The joint capsule is lined with a synovial membrane, producing synovial fluid, which is of importance for lubrication and nutrition of the joint. The joint space {{is divided into two}} functional compartments by an articulating disc. Although the bony <b>joint</b> <b>partners</b> {{are covered with}} fibrocartilage, and not by hyaline cartilage {{as is the case in}} most other synovial joints, the TMJ functions as a synovial joint.

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{development}} of a flip chip package with a long term thermal resistance for temperatures above 250 °C and additional high reliability against temperature cycling is shown. Since standard organic underfill materials can not be used at these high temperatures a solder frame structure was added along the chip edges. This leads, analogue to the function principle of an underfill, to a bow of the whole package instead of a lateral prolongation of the <b>joint</b> <b>partners.</b> Thereby the solder bumps stay aligned perpendicular to their <b>joint</b> <b>partners</b> and as a consequence the lateral deformation as well as the thermomechanical tension are reduced. The bump and the frame connections were produced with a gold/tin Solid-Liquid Interdiffuision (SLID) solder process. By the presented concept of an additional solder frame the thermomechanical tension could be reduced and the reliability against thermal cycles is increased significantly. The thermal stability is shown for temperatures up to 300 °C...|$|R
