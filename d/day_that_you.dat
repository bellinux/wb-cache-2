500|$|Walpole {{is quite}} taken by this {{tradition}} and mentions it in several letters to his friends. [...] In {{a letter to}} the Countess of Ailesbury (Lady Caroline Campbell, daughter of John Campbell, 4th Duke of Argyll and widow of Charles Bruce, 4th Earl of Elgin and 3rd Earl of Ailesbury but by this stage married to Hon. H. S. Conway), Walpole with tongue firmly in cheek berates her for not having come to Whichnoure to claim the flitch: [...] "Are you not ashamed, Madam, never to have put in your claim? It is above a year and a <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have been married, and I never once heard either of you mention a journey to Whichnoure." [...] Describing the location and explaining why the flitch no longer gets claimed, he writes [...] "... it is a little paradise, and the more like an antique one, as, by all I have said, the married couples seem to be driven out of it." [...] Walpole concludes, [...] "If you love a prospect, or bacon, you will certainly come hither." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} {{is portrayed as}} having created, or at least contributed to, his own reputation. When Gibbs tells Will that Sparrow escaped from a desert island by strapping two sea turtles together, Sparrow embellishes the story by claiming the rope was made from hair from his own back, while in reality, Sparrow escaped the island by bartering with rum traders. The video game [...] bases itself on these tall tales, including the sacking of Nassau port without firing a shot. Depp has likened pirates to rock stars in that their fame preceded them. Sparrow insists on being addressed as [...] "Captain" [...] and often gives the farewell, [...] "This is the day you will always remember as the <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow!" [...] which is sometimes humorously cut off. When Norrington accuses him of being the worst pirate he has ever heard of, Sparrow replies, [...] "But you have heard of me." [...] In a deleted scene from The Curse of the Black Pearl Sparrow ponders being [...] "the immortal Captain Jack Sparrow", and during At World's End he again is interested in immortality, although his father, Captain Teague, warns {{it can be a}} terrible curse. Sparrow ponders being [...] "Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate," [...] as the East India Trading Company purges piracy.|$|E

2500|$|The Book of Jubilees {{interpreted}} God's {{warning to}} Adam in [...] that [...] "on the <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> eat of it you shall die" [...] {{in the light}} of the words of Psalm [...] that [...] "a thousand years in [...] sight are but as yesterday," [...] noting that Adam died 70 years short of the 1000 years that would constitute one day in the testimony of the heavens. And the Books of 4 Ezra (or 2 Esdras) and 2 Baruch interpreted [...] to teach that because Adam transgressed God's commandment, God decreed death to Adam and his descendents for all time.|$|E
2500|$|A Baraita deduced {{from the}} words [...] "you shall make them known to your children, and your children's children" [...] in [...] {{that if a}} parent teaches a child Torah, Scripture ascribes merit as though the parent had taught the child, the child's children, and so on, {{until the end of}} all time. Rabbi Joshua ben Levi taught that if a parent teaches a child (or some say a grandchild) Torah, Scripture {{accounts}} it as if the parent had received the Torah at Mount Sinai, as [...] says, [...] "And you shall make them known to your children and your children's children," [...] and immediately thereafter, [...] says, [...] "The <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> stood before the Lord your God in Horeb." [...] Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba once found Rabbi Joshua ben Levi, who had hurriedly thrown a cloth upon his head, taking his child (or some say grandchild) to the synagogue to study. When Rabbi Hiyya asked Rabbi Joshua what was going on, Rabbi Joshua replied that it was no small thing that the words [...] "you shall make them known to your children and your children's children" [...] are immediately followed by the words [...] "The <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> stood before the Lord your God in Horeb." [...] From then on, Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba did not eat breakfast before revising the previous day's lesson with his child (or some say grandchild) and adding another verse. And Rabbah son of Rav Huna did not eat breakfast until he took his child (or some say grandchild) to school.|$|E

[...] Faisal concluded that [...] "In all cases, the film is definitely action-packed, and perhaps Saudis and Arabs may enjoy it more than Americans, as events are depicted as taking place in the Saudi capital…and it is not every <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> watch a Hollywood-style car chase happening on the streets of Riyadh. For Westerners, the movie might be an interesting “insight” to a culture that is very different to their own." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 5 October 2014, it was {{announced}} that West would be leaving the show in a [...] "dramatic" [...] storyline. Dominic Treadwell-Collins, executive producer, said of West's departure, [...] "When you have an actor of Tim's calibre joining your cast, you treasure every <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have him - and we knew from the start that Stan's stay {{with the rest of the}} Carter family would be a finite one. But what a stay - and as we draw towards Stan's exit from the show, the audience should get ready as one of Britain's finest actors pulls out all the stops and gives his King Lear..." [...] It was reported on 2 November 2014 that Babe Smith (Annette Badland) would grow suspicious of Stan's whereabouts and when she discovers the truth, order him to tell his family. Over a week later, it {{was announced}} that Stan would confirm he has terminal prostate cancer to his family after Babe hastily tells them at Lee's birthday meal. These scenes were praised by Prostate Cancer UK. On 20 December 2014, Dyer revealed on The Graham Norton Show that Stan would ask Mick to help him die in a new euthanasia storyline. Dyer said, [...] "I'm juggling about eight storylines at the moment. My old man is on his way out. My mother's got Alzheimer's - she's not my mother, my sister's actually my mum. My dad dying - he's not my dad, he's actually my grandad - he wants me to smother him." [...] The prostate cancer began taking its effect on Stan's health on 23 January 2015 when Stan collapses in mid-commotion. Digital Spy Sophie Dainty reported in January 2015 that the Carters would clash over Stan's request to be killed by his family as Tina agrees to helping him, but Mick firmly disagrees. Mick even informs the family of Stan's request and they strongly disagree. Stan's request was made following his collapse. West praised show bosses for handling Stan's cancer storyline the way they have and their way of handling West's decision to leave the show, [...] "They very kindly said I could have some time out and they would send me to South Africa or prison. But I suggested something finite like death so they decided it would be good for me to have a disease of which I would know about and one where it could be arranged for me to die in six months' time." ...|$|E
