40|$|Abstract. The {{motivation}} {{for this work}} is to explain the development of special textures during recrystallization such as the cube component, { 001 } in fcc metals. Monte Carlo simulation is used with two different mobility and energy functions. The energy function has little influence on texture development whereas the mobility function has a strong influence. A mobility function with a single broad peak does not promote growth of the cube although texture changes do occur. A sharply peaked mobility function, however, leads to marked growth in the cube. The behavior of the various texture components is studied by tracking the <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>area</b> between orientations. Plots in the same Euler space used to depict textures reveal a wealth of detail about which components gain or lose area from each other...|$|R

The dynamics of LULCC critically analyzed for the two time periods 1987 – 1997 and 1997 – 2007. The LULCC analyzed in terms of quantity of change and allocation of change.

The receptors were transiently expressed in HEK- 293 cells, and potencies of the agonists to elicit cytosolic Ca 2 + elevation were measured. The results show that the N-terminal regions of the receptor are most important, and the <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> the <b>area</b> from the C-terminal part of the transmembrane helix 2 to the transmembrane helix 4 is enough to lead to an almost total change of the receptor’s ligand profile...|$|R

There was a boundary change to the civil parish in 1885 when the county boundary between Lancashire and Cheshire was adjusted: it gained part of Thelwall civil parish from Cheshire. A complex set of boundary changes occurred in 1933, involving the county boundary with Cheshire: the civil parish gained part of Lymm ancient parish; <b>exchanged</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> land with Grappenhall ancient parish; and <b>exchanged</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> land with Thelwall civil parish, all in Cheshire. Finally, and again in 1933, the civil parish of Woolston with Martinscroft was abolished and parts used to create the civil parishes of Croft and the modern day civil parish of Woolston, both in Lancashire. This new civil parish of Woolston was formed from parts of the old Woolston with Martinscroft civil parish, as explained above, and also part of Culcheth civil parish. It remained in Warrington rural district until the local government reforms of 1974 which created the borough of Warrington which was located in Cheshire. In 1998, when Warrington borough became a unitary authority, it remained in the ceremonial county of Cheshire, and continued to be served by Cheshire Police and Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service.|$|R

Stereological techniques were used to estimate the surface <b>area</b> <b>of</b> the <b>exchange</b> vessels on random thin sections from four control and four duct-ligated glands.
