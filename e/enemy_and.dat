5|$|After being {{questioned}} sharply, Đính quickly became angry. Ray Herndon of United Press International {{asked him to}} name the country that he was referring to, but Đính dodged the question.

After several reporters derisively laughed at these comments, Đính stormed out of the conference.|$|E

5|$|First and Second World War dazzle camouflage, {{pioneered by}} English artist Norman Wilkinson, was {{used not to}} make ships disappear, but to make them seem smaller and/or faster, to {{encourage}} misidentification by an <b>enemy</b> <b>and</b> to make the ships harder to hit. In the Second World War, the Royal Canadian Navy trialled a form of active camouflage, counter-illumination, using diffused lighting to prevent ships from appearing as dark shapes against a brighter sky during the night. It reduced visibility by up to 70%, but was unreliable and never went into production.|$|E

5|$|Virginia headed {{directly}} for the Union squadron. The battle opened when Union tug Zouave fired on the advancing <b>enemy,</b> <b>and</b> Beaufort replied.
