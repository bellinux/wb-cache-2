5|$|Racial {{tensions}} increased {{after the}} United States Supreme Court's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education to end segregation <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>education,</b> which it ruled as unconstitutional. Many segregationists believed the ruling {{would lead to}} interracial dating and marriage. Whites strongly resisted the court's ruling; one Virginia county closed all its public schools to prevent integration. Other jurisdictions simply ignored the ruling. In other ways, whites used stronger measures to keep blacks politically disenfranchised, {{which they had been}} {{since the turn of the}} century. Segregation in the South was used to constrain blacks forcefully from any semblance of social equality.|$|E

5|$|Several {{branches}} of creationism, including creation science, neo-creationism, and intelligent design, {{argue that the}} idea of life being directly designed by a god or intelligence is at least as scientific as evolutionary theory, and should therefore be taught <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>education.</b> Such arguments against evolution have become widespread and include objections to evolution's evidence, methodology, plausibility, morality, and scientific acceptance. The scientific community does not recognize such objections as valid, pointing to detractors' misinterpretations of such things as the scientific method, evidence, and basic physical laws.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to her work at Hull House, Smith was involved <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>education.</b> Francis Wayland Parker invited her to head the vocal music department at the Chicago Normal School in 1897 and she was asked by John Dewey to teach at the University of Chicago {{as the head of}} the Department of Music, School of Education from 1901 to 1910.

25|$|One {{unforeseen}} {{result of}} the launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union was the immediate emphasis on education for bright students in the United States, and this settled the question whether {{the federal government should}} get involved <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>education</b> at all. The National Defense Education Act (NDEA) was passed by Congress in 1958 with $1 billion US to bolster science, math, and technology <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>education.</b> Educators immediately pushed to identify gifted students and serve them in schools. Students chosen for gifted services were given intelligence tests with a strict cutoff, usually at 130, which meant that students who scored below the 130 were not identified.|$|E

25|$|After the First World War (19141918), the {{teaching}} of creation and evolution <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>education</b> grew as a public controversy.
