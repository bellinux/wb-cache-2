The plants were grown in the plastic pots, which were subjected to the respective combination of the day (8 : 30 ～ 17 : 30) and the night (17 : 30 ～ 8 : 30) water-temperatures in the three sorts of water baths regulated at 25 ℃, 31 ℃, and 37 ℃, respectively. These treatments were conducted during the period from July 1 st to August 13 th, and the plants were gathered to be examined. The top- and root-growths were most prominent at the constant temperature of 31 ℃, which were suppressed remarkably at 37 ℃ during the night, and the growths under the constant high water-temperature (37 ℃) were made to be ceased completely in a few days. The negative influence of high water-temperature was almost denied almost in the case when the day water-temperature was kept at 25 ℃ or 31 ℃, respectively. The plant-length was promoted mostly within the range from 31 ℃ to 25 ℃, whereas it was restrained by the high water-temperature (37 ℃) at day or night, especially at night.

40|$|In forest ecology, a snag {{refers to}} a standing, partly or {{completely}} dead tree, often missing a top {{or most of the}} smaller branches. The accurate estimation of live and dead biomass in forested ecosystems is important for studies of carbon dynamics, biodiversity, and forest management. Therefore, an understanding of its availability and spatial distribution is required. So far, LiDAR remote sensing has been successfully used to assess live trees and their biomass, but studies focusing on dead trees are rare. The paper develops a methodology for retrieving individual dead trees in a mixed mountain forest using features that are derived from small-footprint airborne full waveform LIDAR data. First, 3 D coordinates of the laser beam reflections, the pulse intensity and width are extracted by waveform decomposition. Secondly, 3 D single trees are detected by an integrated approach, which delineates both dominate tree crowns and understory small trees in the canopy height model (CHM) using the watershed algorithm followed by applying normalized cuts segmentation to merged watershed areas. Thus, single trees can be obtained as 3 D point segments associated with waveform-specific features per point. Furthermore, the tree segments are delivered to feature definition process to derive geometric and reflectional features at single tree level, e. g. volume and maximal <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> <b>crown,</b> mean intensity, gap fraction, etc. Finally, the spanned feature space for the tree segments is forwarded to a binary classifier using support vector machine (SVM) in order to discriminate dead trees from the living ones. The methodology is applied to datasets that have been captured with the Riegl LMS-Q 560 laser scanner at a point density of 25 points/m 2 in the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany, respectively under leaf-on and leaf-off conditions for Norway spruces, European beeches and Sycamore maples.

(P. caspica) as endemic and endangered poplar species. Some quantitative characteristics of the trees and soil samples were taken based on completely randomized block design. Samplings of live and senescent leaves were carried out in two-stages, mid-summer during the peak nutritional activities of trees and mid-autumn for senescent leaves. Soil samples were analyzed to determine organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P) and exchangeable potassium (K). OC, total of N, P and K were also determined in live and senescent leaves. The results showed that P. d “Harvard” had the highest total height, DBH and <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> <b>crown</b> compared to the other species and clones. The amount of OC, N and P in soil and live leaves of P. d “Harvard” clone are more than those of the other species and clones. OC, N, P, and K returned by senescent leaves were higher and lower for P. d “Harvard” and P. caspica respectively. P retranslocation for all of the clones and species was higher compared to N and K. The highest retranslocation percentage was observed in P. caspica (N= 18. 93, P= 39. 63, K= 24. 02) and the lowest (N= 12. 09, P= 32. 46, K= 21. 14) in P. d “Harvard” clone.

40|$|Background and Purpose: The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} measuring wood and leaf mass {{above the ground}} level of hop hornbeam shrubs (Ostrya carpinifolia Scop.). An {{important part of the}} study describes the development of models for quick and reliable estimation of biomass in forest ecosystems. Materials and Methods: The research was done and samples collected on seaside slopes of Velebit, the area of the Obrovac forestry, on experimental subplots 1 and 2, Jesenice management unit, department 41. Biomass of wood and leaves was measured separately as weight and volume. Independable estimators were the <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> the sprout, the height of the sprout and the <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> the <b>crown.</b> The weight <b>of</b> wood and leaves was measured in kg, volume in m 3, <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> the sprout in cm, height of the sprout and crown diameter in m. General linear modelling was used {{for the development of the}} model. Results: The volume of wood in shrubs varied from 18. 07 to 65. 22 m 3 /ha, the volume of leaves from 5. 75 to 13. 70 m 3 /ha. The volume depends on the degradation stage of the shrub, that is the dimensions of the units composing it, their number in the area, entity and the manner of grouping, and the intrinsic value of site. The results show that wood and leaf mass in hop hornbeam shrubs are in particularly strong linear dependence on <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> the sprout, height of the sprout and crown diameter. Linear regression coefficient between the volume, as well as the weight of the wood and the <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> the sprout,was 0. 920 at 30 cm height above the ground level, and 0. 898 between the volume, as well as the weight of the leaves and the <b>crown</b> <b>of</b> the sprout. Conclusions: The biomass above the ground level in hop hornbeam shrubs can at best be estimated by univariate regression analysis on the basis <b>of</b> sprout <b>diameter,</b> although this regression model yields nearly equal results if based on the height of the sprout and the <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> the <b>crown.</b> Multivariate regression models do not give much better results than the univariate model, especially by the <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> the sprout as the best independable estimator, where the values are nearly equal...|$|R

The construction of the spatial distribution model on the tree area indicating the <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> <b>crowns</b> area and the areas of intersection of circles of the competition of the trees of both species was performed {{with the use of}} Quantum GIS. To {{determine the}} dependence of the current growth of the pine part of the stand on the influence of admixture of birch trees in 44 pines a radial growth was determined, the data were divided into three groups according to the intensity of growth: weak – radial growth for 10 years, 0 – 10 mm, average – 10 – 20 mm and intensive – 20 mm and more. The current growth for the selected trees was determined by different methods based on the taxation indices of trees.

Stating {{of biomass}} in forest {{ecosystems}} {{and development of}} models for its quick estimation {{is an important part}} of investigation, especially on karst. During many years of research on research projects the authors have collected and partly published data about biomass for some important species on Mediterranean karst area of Croatia. This paper presents the results of green wood and foliage mass measurement above soil level in maquis of strawberry tree (Arbutus unedoL.). Research was made and samples collected on permanent experimental plot on Vrgorac area. The plot has dimensions of 1 ha, the subplot number 15, which was excluded and on which measurements on vegetation was made and its basic structural data stated, has 100 m 2 (table 1). Canopy on subplot amounts to 69, 61 %, the medium height of sprout of strawberry tree is 1, 61 m (maximal 2, 30 m). Wood and foliage mass on experimental plot was measured separately for every bush as weight and volume, the independent estimation were the height <b>of</b> the bush, <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> the <b>crown</b> and number <b>of</b> sprouts on the trunk. The weight of wood and leaf was measured in kg, the volume in m 3, the height of the bush and <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> bush <b>crown</b> in m. The volume of wood in research maquis, on the area of 100 m 2, amounts to 0, 095 m 3, the volume of leaf 0, 074 m 3. The important part of the research also comprises the model for quick and reliable estimation of wood and leaf mass in these forest ecosystems. General lineal modelling was used for development of the model. In table 3 it is evident that the height and wood volume is in strong correlation with number of sprouts on the trunk (r = 0, 611) and bush height (r = 0, 619) and in very strong correlation with crown diameter (r = 0, 846). The weight and leaf volume are in strong correlation with bush height (r = 0, 610), in very strong with number of sprouts on the trunk (r = 0, 775) and crown diameter (r = 0, 892). On the basis of number of sprouts on the trunk, bush height and <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> the <b>crown,</b> as independent variables, the weight and wood and leaf volume of strawberry tree were estimated by univariate and multivariate regression analysis. In table 4 and figure 4 the regression models for estimation of weight and volume of wood and foliage of strawberry tree on experimental plot 15 are shown. By univariate regression analysis the significant dependance on weight and volume of wood and leaf with number of sprouts on the trunk, height <b>of</b> bush and <b>crown</b> <b>diameter</b> was stated. The results show that the number of sprouts explains 35, 5 % (ß = 0, 611; p< 0, 0001), the height of the bush 36, 5 % (ß = 0, 619; p< 0, 0001), the crown diameter 70, 7 % (ß = 0, 846; p< 0, 0001) the variability of the weight and wood volume. The number of sprouts on the explains 59, 2 % (ß = 0, 777; p< 0, 0001), the height of the bush 35, 4 % (ß = 0, 610; p< 0, 0001) and crown diameter 79, 0 % (ß = 0, 893; p< 0, 0001) of variability of leaf weight and volume. In figure 4, besides regression analysis of dependance of weight and volume of wood and leaf on number of sprouts on the trunk and <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> the <b>crown</b> the equations <b>of</b> regression line beside the level of significance of 5 % were given. By multivariate regression analysis (table 4) the significal dependance of weight and tree volume and leaf with crown diameter was stated Td-(ß = 0, 756; p< 0, 0001), Tl-(ß = 0, 843; p< 0, 0001), while the significance for bush height was not stated Td-(ß = 0, 142; p< 0, 233), Tl-(ß = 0, 078; p< 0, 441). The results of multivariate regression analysis show that the <b>crown</b> <b>diameter</b> and height <b>of</b> bush explain 71, 1 % of variability of weight and volume of wood (R 2 = 0, 711) and 78, 8 % variability of weight and leaf volume (R 2 = 0, 788).

The orchards {{are located in the}} cities of Alhandra (Coastal), Camalaú, Monteiro and Serra Branca (Cariri West), Nova Floresta (Wild) and Sapé (Zona da Mata), with plants propagated by seminal and four years of age, approximately. For those linear dimensions of the plants were assessed height, <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> the <b>crown</b> and perimeter <b>of</b> the stem. For the chemical and physical characterizations were collected 150 fruits per orchard, same stage of maturation per plant.

The experimental design was the randomized blocks, appear to six treatments (an orchard by city) and fifteen replicates (plants per orchard). Preliminary results concluded that the acerolas tree of the semi-arid region, even with additional supply of irrigation water, had lower biometric performance and intrinsic and extrinsic attributes than the other physiographic regions.

40|$|A set of 37 genotypes {{selected}} from a survey of over 200 diverse germplasms, for their diverse drought tolerance mechanisms, were analyzed in this study for root physiological traits that are indicative of different drought resistance mechanisms. The genotypes include controls such as the drought sensitive IR 64 and Nipponbare, along with the drought resistant Nagina 22 (N 22) and Bengal landraces to identify distinguishing phenotypic features of resistant accessions. Anatomical traits studied include total areas of the cross-sections of the stele, cortex, aerenchyma, cortical-cell, and xylem tissue; the number of aerenchyma, xylem vessels, cortical cell file number and size that together describe a number of root phenes, or individual traits that can be analyzed genetically. To make paired comparisons in size using cross-section area the ratio of xylem to stele, stele to cortex, cortex to cross-section, stele to cross-section, cortical cell area to cortex, and aerenchyma to cortical cell area were calculated. Architectural traits were evaluated for root <b>diameter,</b> number <b>of</b> <b>crown</b> roots, lateral root densities, root length and root angles. To study the expression of genes with known function in root traits, the intrinsic gene expression levels of ten candidate genes under optimal growth conditions were estimated by qRT-PCR, which was then used in correlation studies with the data on phenotypic variation.

40|$|This paper {{contains}} two parts: a short description of our tree finder, and a concept for the automatic {{evaluation of the}} results. The basic idea of our delineation approach is, that the coarse structure <b>of</b> the <b>crown</b> can be approximated {{with the help of}} a sphere or an ellipsoid. This assumption is true, if the fine structure <b>of</b> the <b>crown</b> is ignored and the coarse structure is revealed in an appropriate level of the multi-scale representation of the surface model. However, this scale level is unknown, because it is correlated with the unknown <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> the <b>crown.</b> The proposed solution for this chicken-and-egg problem is to investigate a wide range of scale levels, and to subsequently select the best hypothesis for a crown from all these scale levels. This selection must be based on an internal evaluation of the obtained results. The evaluation concept is based on the classification of the topological relations between the crown’s projection from different data sets onto the ground level. In general, eight different topological relations exist in 2 D space: disjoint, touch, overlap, covers, contains, contained by, covers, and covered by. These topological relations can be subdivided into two clusters C 1 and C 2, where the C 1 cluster includes the relations disjoint, touch and C 2 the other ones apart from the overlap relation. The overlap relation is between these two clusters, it can be divided into weak-overlap (C 1) and strong-overlap (C 2). The motivation behind this partitioning is that the relations in C 1 are similar to disjoint, and in C 2 to equal. In our approach the type of the relation cluster is used in the internal evaluation to decide whether hypotheses from different scale levels are identical. In the external evaluation, we use the relation cluster to decide which trees from a reference data set are identical to automatically extracted trees. 1...|$|R

J. APPELMAN on July 15, 1952, is remarkable for the abnormal development of its right P 1. The full permanent dentition is in place except for the posterior premolars and last molars, which are in alveolo. The teeth are but little worn and, apart from the right P 1, they do not show anv unusual characters. The left P 1 has the shape normally found in the Brazilian tapir; the crown is triangular with rounded angles, and bears a continuous outer crest (ectoloph) extending from the front angle (parastyle) to the posterior outer cusp (metacone). The position of the central outer cusp (paracone), merged in the crest, is indicated only by a weak vertical ridge on the labial face of the ectoloph, flattening toward the crown base, the paracone style. The posterior inner cusp (hypocone) is a low but distinct, anteroposteriorly elongated elevation of the cingulum. The protocone is just visible as a tiny cusp on the lingual cingulum, internal to the paracone. The labial cingulum is shown as a slight swelling all along {{the base of the}} ectoloph.
