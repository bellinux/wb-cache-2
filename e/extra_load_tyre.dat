40|$|A new {{formulation}} {{to determine}} the unit impulse response (Green’s) functions of a <b>loaded</b> rotating <b>tyre</b> in the vehicle-fixed (Eulerian) reference frame for tyre/road noise predictions is presented. The proposed formulation makes use of the set of eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes for the statically <b>loaded</b> <b>tyre</b> obtained from a finite element (FE) model of the tyre. A closed-form expression for the Green’s functions of a rotating tyre in the Eulerian reference system {{as a function of}} the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of the statically <b>loaded</b> <b>tyre</b> is found. Non-linear effects during loading are accounted for in the FE model, while the frequency shift due to the rotational velocity is included in the calculation of the Green’s functions. In the literature on tyre/road noise these functions are generally used {{to determine the}} tyre response during tyre/road contact calculations. The presented formulation opens the possibility to solve the contact problem directly in the Eulerian reference frame and to include local tyre softening due to non-linear effects while keeping the computational advantage of describing the tyre dynamics as a set of impulse response functions. The advantage of obtaining the Green’s functions in the Eulerian reference system is that only the Green’s functions corresponding to the potential contact zone need to be determined, which significantly reduces the computational cost of solving the tyre/road contact and since the mesh is fixed in space, a finer mesh can be used for the potential contact zone, improving the accuracy of the contact force calculations. Although these effects might be less pronounced if a more accurate tyre model is used, it is found that using the Green’s functions of the <b>loaded</b> <b>tyre</b> in a contact force calculation leads to smaller forces than in the unloaded case, lower frequencies are present in the response and they decrease faster as the rotational velocity increases...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Many {{studies have}} {{emphasized}} the importance of resistive exercise to maintain a healthy human body, particular in prevention of weakening of physical strength. Recently, some studies advocated that an application of vibration as a supplementary means in a regular training was effective in encouraging physical strength. Aim of the current study was, therefore, to identify if an application of vibration in a resistive exercise was effective in encouraging physical strength as that in a regular training. A 3 -dimensional virtual lower extremity model for a healthy male and virtual leg-press model were generated and synchronized. Dynamic leg-press exercises on a slide machine with/without <b>extra</b> <b>load</b> and on a footboard with vibration as well as on a slide machine with <b>extra</b> <b>load</b> were analyzed. The results of the current indicated that the application of the vibration on the dynamic leg-press exercise might be not greatly effective in encouraging physical strength, compared with the dynamic leg press exercise with <b>extra</b> <b>load.</b> It was, however, thought that the application of the vibration might be helpful to elderly individuals because the reduced maximum muscle strength appeared by the effect of the vibration may avoid a muscular spasm, which can be driven from a high muscle strength sometimes produced during the leg-press exercise with <b>extra</b> <b>load.</b> Keywords—Resistive exercise, leg-press exercise, muscle strength.

40|$|Much {{functionality}} of today's vehicles runs as {{software on}} embedded computer systems. This includes, for example, automatic climate control and engine control. As the processors necessarily {{are located in}} diffent physical locations inside the vehicle wires must be drawn between processors that need to communicate. Therefore, it is typical to have one or several buses connecting the processors in an embedded computer network, thus creating a distributed system. As {{some parts of the}} system in the car have real-time properties, it is necessary to validate that the real-time properties are upheld in the distributed system. This thesis presents the design and implementation of an adaptive cruise controller (ACC), which is a cruise controller that also keeps a minimum distance to the closest vehicle in front. Further, the performance of the ACC has been evaluated using an existing system-level simulator for distributed real-time systems together with metrics for Quality-of-Control (QoC). The ACC has then been simulated under different scenarios. The scenarios include outside conditions, for example the slope of the road, the behaviour of the vehicle in front, and the desired velocity, as well as internal conditions as adding different amounts of <b>extra</b> <b>load</b> on the processors and the bus. The results show that the functionality of the ACC starts deteriorating when the <b>extra</b> <b>load</b> on the nodes reaches high levels. When the <b>extra</b> <b>load</b> reaches very high levels, the ACC stops functioning completely. The results also show that the <b>extra</b> <b>load</b> on the bus has very little effect on the performance of the ACC...|$|R

We present such experiences in Third World institutions where, due to economic and infrastructure limitations, tools such as Course Administration Software cannot be used. We instead substitute them with standard software tools, which are then integrated with modern pedagogical and technical principles, into our entire teaching approach.
