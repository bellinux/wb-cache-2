5|$|Homer and Bart {{arrive at}} the school during the school-dance to steal the grease in the school's kitchen which Bart told him about. They sneak <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> plants a hose in the fryer to suck it into the car, but Willie spots them and {{attempts}} to stop them, claiming the grease to be his retirement plan. Homer tries to escape, but Willie grabs his legs and strangles him with the hose sucking the grease, which explodes due to the increased pressure, causing the grease to flood into the dance hall. A grease fight begins among the students, where Alex eventually joins in after being told by Lisa to act her own age.|$|E
25|$|After {{an injury}} {{forced him to}} leave Bob Astor, he stayed a while in New York. He played with Bobby Byrne in late 1942, then with Charlie Barnet for whom he wrote the classic {{arrangement}} of Skyliner. During his time in New York, he hung around the clubs on 52nd Street, listening to bebop trumpet master Dizzy Gillespie and other musicians, and immersing himself in the new music. Since he didn't {{have the money to}} actually go into the clubs, he would sneak <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> hang out with the bands, and he got to know many of the great beboppers.|$|E
25|$|The four terrorists stormed {{into the}} ship's dining room. They shot their {{automatic}} weapons {{over the heads}} of the eating passengers. Screams from the passengers meshed with the shouting of the gunmen and with the sound of falling glass shards and splinters. Viola Meskin tried to run to a door but was intercepted by a terrorist with a gun who turned her back. Austrian passenger Anna Hoeranter ran to an exit but was pushed down an adjacent flight of stairs by one of the terrorists. Other passengers ran in a panic from the dining room <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> were chased by one of the terrorists. Inside the kitchen the pursuing terrorist beat two of the kitchen staff to the floor.|$|E

60|$|She went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> second <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> took a lantern. Her father {{watched her}} as she returned.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's right,' whispered Miss Price, 'say {{something}} kind to her, and she'll soon come round. Here! Shall John and I go <b>into</b> <b>the</b> little <b>kitchen,</b> <b>and</b> {{come back}} presently?' ...|$|R
25|$|By April and May 1971, Genie's {{scores on}} the Leiter International Performance Scale tests had {{dramatically}} increased, with her overall mental age {{at the level of}} a typical 4-year-9-month-old, but on individual components she still showed a very high level of scatter. Her progress with language accelerated, and doctors noticed that the words she used indicated a fairly advanced mental categorization of objects and situations and focused on objective properties to a degree not normally found in children. Around that time, when a minor earthquake struck Los Angeles, she ran frightened <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> rapidly verbalized to some of the hospital cooks she had befriended, marking the first time she sought out comfort from another person and the first time she was so readily verbal. However, she still had a hard time being with large crowds of people; at her birthday party, she became so anxious at all the guests present that she had to go outside with Rigler to calm down.|$|E
500|$|Later, Homer {{is playing}} with the doll when it starts {{saying that it is}} going to kill him. He dismisses this until the doll threatens to stab him. After {{numerous}} attempts on Homer’s life, he captures the evil Krusty doll, locks it in a suitcase, and drops it in a [...] "Bottomless Pit". Returning home, Homer is ambushed by the escaped doll, who tackles him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> tries to drown him in Santa's Little Helper's dog bowl.|$|E
500|$|CS gas {{was used}} {{extensively}} by Bahrain's police {{from the start}} of the Bahraini uprising. [...] The Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry concluded that Bahrain's police used a disproportionate amount of CS gas when dispersing protests, and that in some situations, police fired CS gas into private homes in an [...] "unnecessary and indiscriminate" [...] manner. [...] In one particular incident witnessed by Commission investigators, police fired [...] "at least four tear gas canisters (each containing six projectiles) ... from a short range <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> living room of a home." ...|$|E
60|$|Then the housemaid {{came running}} down <b>the</b> stairs singing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> dusting-brush <b>and</b> dust-pan in her hands--a pretty girl with dark merry bright eyes, and her brown hair worn frizzled on her forehead.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Duks,' {{answered}} the beasts; and {{that must have}} meant, 'We are quite willing,' for the old man went on, 'Here is abundance; go <b>into</b> <b>the</b> back <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> cook us a supper.' ...|$|R
60|$|Rollo and Nathan were {{exceedingly}} {{pleased with}} this plan; and even Rollo's mother looked somewhat gratified. She {{said she did}} not know much about magnetism, and she meant to go out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> herself, <b>and</b> hear <b>the</b> lecture.|$|R
500|$|The Simpsons are {{in their}} {{backyard}} having a barbecue when they are abducted by extraterrestrial life forms (specifically Kang and Kodos). The aliens explain that they are taking the Simpsons to their home planet on Rigel IV, [...] "a world of infinite delights," [...] for a 'feast'. En route they present the family with enormous amounts of food and watch eagerly as they gorge themselves, then check their weights, being particularly delighted at Homer's mass. Suspicious of the alien's intentions, Lisa sneaks <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> finds a book titled How To Cook Humans. She takes the book and shows it to the aliens, who explain to her {{that part of the}} title was obscured by space dust, which they then blow away to reveal the title How To Cook For Humans. Lisa, skeptical at this, blows off more space dust, revealing the title to be How To Cook Forty Humans. The aliens blow off the last of the space dust, finally revealing the real title How To Cook For Forty Humans. Enraged at Lisa's mistrust, they return the Simpsons to Earth, explaining that Lisa ruined the family's chance at paradise on the aliens' home planet.|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 6 October 1965, Hindley drove Brady to Manchester Central railway station, where she waited outside in the car while he {{selected}} their victim. After a few minutes Brady reappeared {{in the company of}} Edward Evans, to whom he introduced Hindley as his sister. After they had driven back home and relaxed over a bottle of wine, Brady sent Hindley to fetch her brother-in-law. When they got back to the house Hindley told Smith to wait outside for her signal, a flashing light. When the signal came, Smith knocked on the door and was met by Brady, who asked if he had come for [...] "the miniature wine bottles". Brady led Smith <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> left him there, saying {{that he was going to}} collect the wine. A few minutes later, Smith heard a scream, followed by Hindley shouting loudly for him to come and help. Smith entered the living room to find Brady repeatedly striking Evans with the flat of an axe, and watched as he then throttled Evans with a length of electrical cord. Evans's body was too heavy for Smith to carry to the car on his own—Brady had sprained his ankle in the struggle—so they wrapped it in plastic sheeting and put it in the spare bedroom.|$|E
2500|$|While {{searching for}} Jack, Wendy discovers {{he has been}} typing pages of a {{repetitive}} manuscript: [...] "all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy". She begs Jack to leave the hotel with Danny, but he threatens her before she knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat. She drags him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> locks him in the pantry, but she and Danny are both trapped at the hotel: Jack has disabled the hotel's two-way radio and snowcat. Later, Jack converses through the pantry door with Grady, who unlocks the door.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Poyser, however, had {{no sooner}} seen the pony move off than she turned round, gave the two hilarious damsels a look which drove them <b>into</b> <b>the</b> back <b>kitchen,</b> <b>and</b> unspearing her knitting, began to knit again with her usual rapidity as she re-entered the house.|$|R
60|$|At {{the same}} instant Dumps scurried <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> <b>The</b> scuttle <b>and</b> tongs went down, the slop-pail and shovel {{followed}} suit, also <b>the</b> watering-pan, <b>into</b> which latter Dumps went head foremost as it fell, and from its interior another yell issued with such resonant power that the first yell was a mere chirp by contrast. The Slogger fled from the scene like an evil spirit, while John Waters sprang up and grasped the pistol and poker.|$|R
50|$|Josh {{agrees to}} help Melissa in her scheme to expose Lassiter's for using frozen tuna <b>and</b> they sneak <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchens</b> <b>and</b> head towards <b>the</b> fridge where {{they find the}} tuna but a <b>kitchen</b> hand shuts <b>the</b> door, leaving Josh and Melissa trapped. Josh quickly stops the fan from {{freezing}} them but Melissa is in danger due to suffering from epilepsy and not having her medication to hand. The couple are saved but Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) is unimpressed with {{the damage to the}} fridge and demands payment for the damages. When Josh begins violin lessons and constantly talks about a woman named Katrina, Melissa is quick to accuse him of cheating on her with another girl. Melissa tracks down Katrina and realizes she is much older than Josh and has worried for nothing.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{additional}} {{scene with}} Donna [...] {{was cut from}} the final episode: [...] "There was an additional Donna bit after this goodbye from the Doctor, which is when he goes outside into the TARDIS, we cut back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> <b>and</b> there's a moment where Donna hears the TARDIS... there's a moment of realisation, and then she turns back round and carries on talking into the phone." [...] Gardner considered this scene untruthful and too confusing, since Donna remembering would lead to her death, and since she didn't recognise the Doctor it wouldn't make sense to assume she would recognise {{the noise of the}} TARDIS.|$|E
2500|$|... "On 7 November {{he asked}} his father if he could borrow the car but his father said no. That {{afternoon}} his parents went out and Miles stayed at home brooding and getting drunk. By the time his parents returned about 7.30pm Miles had decided what to do. He {{went down to the}} garage and using a piece of lead pipe he beat his father to death. Taking the same piece of pipe into the house he then went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> bludgeoned his mother to death. He took the bodies and tipped them over the cliff {{at the end of the}} garden and then got in the car and drove to see his girlfriend in London. [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|Welcome Table is {{dedicated}} [...] "to every wannabe cook who will dare criticism by getting <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> stirring up some groceries", and {{well as to}} Angelou's friend Oprah Winfrey, [...] "who said she wanted a big, pretty cookbook". Angelou adds, [...] "Well, honey, here you are". Angelou, on her acknowledgement page, also thanks [...] "all the great cooks whose food I have eaten and whose stories I have heard". [...] She thanks those who helped her compile the recipes in the book, and her family, who sampled her food. She also thanked Brian Lanker, who photographed the dishes, and Brian Daigle, who drove her tour bus as she and her assistant, Lydia Stuckey, traveled the U.S.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Simpson {{gazed at}} her fixedly, and then, with an {{impatient}} exclamation, walked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> small <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> began to set the supper. A joint of cold beef, a jar of pickles, bread, butter, and cheese made an appetizing display. Then he took a jug from the dresser and descended to the cellar.|$|R
60|$|As {{he came in}} out of {{the barn}} on this spring day, he turned to look up at the roof with a curse. Something had angered him. He did not stop to comb his hair after washing at the pump, but came <b>into</b> <b>the</b> neat <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> surlily took a seat at the table.|$|R
5000|$|Jake: Ernest's Fantail (goldfish) in Ernest Goes to Africa. Sadly, Jake {{died when}} Ernest accidentally broke his fish bowl and then dropped him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> garbage {{disposal}} <b>and</b> mistakenly hit the wrong switch.|$|R

6000|$|It was impossible, of course, {{to prevent}} some {{of all this}} leaking <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> <b>the</b> nursery, <b>and</b> the stable. In the first-mentioned spot, Quin remarked to the housemaid,--"Sure, it's a quare evint entirely," [...] with which {{sentiment}} the housemaid agreed.|$|R
5000|$|... 1966: The {{northeast}} corner was filled in {{as part of}} a new storage and toilet area and a cream brick mail room was constructed on the southern side of the building. The upper floor was subsequently converted to a lunch room and staff facility which involved the incorporation of <b>the</b> southern balcony <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> area <b>and</b> removal of a partition wall between a former bedroom and sitting room.|$|R
60|$|Hearing the street-door slam, Peter stole <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> brewed {{himself a}} cup of coffee.|$|E
60|$|Then Clemantiny {{went back}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> cried--good, rough-spoken, tender-hearted Clemantiny {{sat down and}} cried.|$|E
60|$|He {{walked the}} length of the hallway, and stepped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> over to a side window.|$|E
5000|$|One afternoon, {{while being}} {{influenced}} by Todd's criminal friend Gary [...] "Boof" [...] Head (Stephen Hall), the teens begin a drinking session which immediately proves dangerous for Melissa as she suffers from epilepsy, luckily Beverly is {{on hand to}} help.

6000|$|... "Half an {{hour later}} Neil Campbell rushed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Sherman <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> oh, how angry he was!

60|$|The dog, {{bored by}} the inaction, had wandered back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> summer <b>kitchen</b> <b>and</b> resumed his broken slumber. One of the tramps {{was leaning against}} the wall talking with the farmer woman. The other was busily engaged in {{scratching}} his right shin with what remained of the heel of his left shoe. He supported himself with one hand on a small table upon the top of which was a family Bible.|$|R
