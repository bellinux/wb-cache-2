5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{escalating}} violence the government was forced to appeal for international peacekeepers on 25 May. Peacekeepers began to arrive in Dili the next day and eventually restored order. A total of 37 people were killed in the fighting in April and May and 155,000 <b>fled</b> <b>their</b> homes. A United Nations inquiry found that the interior and defence ministers and the commander of the F-FDTL had illegally transferred weapons to civilians during the crisis and recommended that they be prosecuted.|$|E

5|$|The German {{breakthrough}} at Sedan, {{which had}} been thought impassable, meant that defenders of the K-W Line risked being outflanked, and had to withdraw on 16 May. The German invasion triggered a panic amongst Belgian civilians {{in the path of}} the advancing German army. By 11 May, the roads leading westwards, away from the fighting, were blocked by refugees, hampering the eastward advance of French and British forces. It is estimated that around two million civilians <b>fled</b> <b>their</b> homes during the campaign.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known inhabitants {{from about}} 400 A.D. {{were members of}} the Hopewell tradition who buried their dead in mounds (now Indian Mounds Park) on the bluffs above the river. The next known inhabitants were the Mdewakanton Dakota in the 17th century who <b>fled</b> <b>their</b> ancestral home of Mille Lacs Lake in central Minnesota in response to westward expansion of the Ojibwe nation. The Ojibwe would later occupy the north (east) bank of the Mississippi River.|$|E

5|$|With Soviet support, 2,000 ANC troops {{launched}} a major offensive against South Kasai. The attack was extremely successful, {{but during the}} course of the offensive, the ANC became involved in infighting between the Baluba and Bena Lulua ethnic groups. As a result, the ANC perpetrated a number of large massacres of Luba civilians. Around 3,000 were killed. The violence of the advance caused an exodus of thousands of Baluba civilians who <b>fled</b> <b>their</b> homes to escape the fighting.|$|E
5|$|Adding to {{the chaos}} were {{fears of a}} {{potential}} second explosion. A cloud of steam shot out of ventilators at the ammunition magazine at Wellington Barracks as naval personnel extinguished a fire by the magazine. While the fire was quickly put out, the cloud was seen from blocks away and quickly led to rumours that another explosion was imminent. Uniformed officers ordered everyone away from the area. As the rumour spread across the city, many families <b>fled</b> <b>their</b> homes. The confusion hampered efforts for over two hours until fears were dispelled by about noon. However, many rescuers ignored the evacuation and naval rescue parties continued working uninterrupted at the harbour.|$|E
5|$|Byzantine Greeks, {{forming the}} {{majority}} of the Byzantine Empire proper at the height of its power, gradually came under the dominance of foreign powers with the decline of the Empire during the Middle Ages. Those who came under Arab Muslim rule, either <b>fled</b> <b>their</b> former lands or submitted to the new Muslim rulers, receiving the status of Dhimmi. Over the centuries these surviving Christian societies of former Byzantine Greeks in Arab realms evolved into Antiochian Greeks, Melchites or merged into the societies of Arab Christians, existing to this day.|$|E

Her forces surrounded Bristol, where Hugh Despenser the Elder had taken shelter; he surrendered and was promptly executed. Edward and Hugh the Younger <b>fled</b> <b>their</b> castle around 2 November, leaving behind jewellery, considerable supplies and at least £13,000 in cash, possibly once again hoping to reach Ireland, but on 16 November they were betrayed and captured by a search party north of Caerphilly. Edward was escorted first to Monmouth Castle, and from there back into England, where he was held at Henry of Lancaster's fortress at Kenilworth. The King's final remaining forces, by now besieged in Caerphilly Castle, surrendered after five months in April 1327.|$|E

Joan and her family <b>fled</b> <b>their</b> village before it was attacked, and it was actually attacked by the Burgundians, not the English. In the film Joan is seen experiencing visions {{as a young child}} when the historical Joan asserted that these visions began around the age of 13. Joan is also seen finding her sword in a field as a child, whereas historically it was uncovered many years later on her journey to Chinon.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arriving}} {{at the foot of}} the settlement, Eric besieged and attacked the city, but was repelled. Led by duke Višeslav, the inhabitants of Trsat threw spears, shot arrows, and hurled huge stones on the enemy, and managed to kill many of them. Eric's forces <b>fled</b> <b>their</b> positions, and were subsequently routed by the forces of Višeslav in an ambush. Eric was among those killed, and his death and defeat proved to be a great blow for the Carolingian Empire. Aquileian Patriarch Saint Paulinus II cursed the land in which the hero was killed, and wrote Carmen de regula fidei, the rhythmus or elegy for his death.|$|E

5|$|Although Hurricane Marco {{never made}} landfall, {{it was a}} large storm with an unusual and erratic path and as a result, caused heavy {{rainfall}} throughout Central America and the western Caribbean nations. In the Dominican Republic, three people drowned north of Santo Domingo, while 200families <b>fled</b> <b>their</b> homes during the flooding. Marco also contributed to an ongoing flood in Jamaica, which had already caused a total of $3million in damage to roads and left 170families without shelter. After significant damage from Hurricane Lili in the previous month, minimal effects occurred in Cuba. Large amounts of precipitation also fell across Cuba, especially on the Isle of Youth and in Pinar del Río Province. Heavy rains caused thousands to flee their homes. However, damage in the country, if any is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Although {{an urban}} revolt in Aleppo {{did not take}} place in the {{aftermath}} of the city's occupation by French forces, many of Aleppo's inhabitants engaged in passive resistance against the French and clandestinely provided material aid to Hananu's rebels fighting in the rural areas west of the city. In addition to the rebels' propaganda campaign, anti-French sentiment in Aleppo was growing due to socio-economic factors. These included the disruption of trade routes between Aleppo and its countryside, the hoarding and profiteering of flour and rising unemployment that was partially a result of an influx of Armenian refugees who had <b>fled</b> <b>their</b> villages in Turkey during the Armenian Genocide. The latter led to soaring prices for bread and subsequent food riots and famine in some of the city's neighborhoods. The French authorities also declared martial law, restricting travel and speech, further frustrating the inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} {{fell across}} the Dominican Republic, with isolated totals of 10inches (250mm) expected. The rainfall caused flooding along the Yaque del Norte River, and initially {{there appeared to}} be a threat that the Tavera Dam along the river would fail, potentially killing thousands in Santiago Province. Officials instead opted to open all six floodgates at 0400UTC on December 12, which released about 1.6milliongallons (6.1millionliters) of water into the river every second. The deluge created a 66foot (20m) wave of water that caught many off guard due to the time of night and only about 15minutes to prepare, according to eyewitnesses who criticized the decision; the flooding killed at least 35people and left homes in seven towns flooded. Two other deaths were reported elsewhere in the country, and more than 34,000people <b>fled</b> <b>their</b> homes due to the storm; more than 7,500houses were damaged. Damage in the country was estimated at $1.5billion (2007DOP, $45million 2007USD). In neighboring Haiti, two deaths were reported in the northern portion of the country. On December 11, a station in the Turks and Caicos Islands recorded sustained winds of 36mph (58km/h).|$|E

5|$|Historians are {{now turning}} to local gazetteers of Ming China for clues {{that would show}} {{consistent}} growth in population. Using the gazetteers, Brook estimates that the overall population under the Chenghua Emperor (r. 1464–1487) was roughly 75 million, despite mid-Ming census figures hovering around 62 million. While prefectures across the empire in the mid-Ming period were reporting either a drop in or stagnant population size, local gazetteers reported massive amounts of incoming vagrant workers with not enough good cultivated land for them to till, so that many would become drifters, conmen, or wood-cutters that contributed to deforestation. The Hongzhi and Zhengde emperors lessened the penalties against those who had <b>fled</b> <b>their</b> home region, while the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–67) finally had officials register migrants wherever they had moved or fled {{in order to bring}} in more revenues.|$|E
5|$|In San Blas, {{strong winds}} from the {{hurricane}} {{damaged or destroyed}} 95% of the homes, with 1,540houses damaged and 8,800people affected. There, large commercial shrimp boats were swept up to 900feet (275m) inland from their docks. An elderly woman died in the city when the wall of her house collapsed on her. Large portions of the city were covered with building debris and sand washed from the ocean. Elsewhere in Nayarit, flying debris killed a person in Santiago Escuintla. There, two elderly men drowned, one by falling into a river. Both were {{believed to have been}} killed during the storm as they <b>fled</b> <b>their</b> homes. In Santiago Ixcuintla, the hurricane damaged 3,770homes, and throughout Nayarit, strong winds from the hurricane destroyed the roofs of hundreds of houses. Federal authorities lost communications with at least 30Indian villages due to the high winds of the hurricane. Kenna destroyed the entire banana, tobacco, and tomato crops in the rural areas of San Blas, Tecuala, and Acaponeta, leaving more than 700subsistence farmers and their families in need of water and food.|$|E
5|$|In Tampico, {{near the}} {{location}} of the storm's second landfall, the streets were littered with fallen trees branches, utility poles, and billboards. Additionally, many roads were inundated with water, leaving some impassable. Nearby, over 700people <b>fled</b> <b>their</b> homes for shelter due to flooding in Ciudad Madero. One death occurred in Pueblo Viejo when a woman was crushed by a tree that fell on her house. Six other deaths occurred in Veracruz, five from a ship capsizing near Boca del Río and another after a person was caught in an undertow offshore Úrsulo Galván. Two landslides in northern Puebla left roads impassable, isolating some communities such as Tlatlauquitepec. Hundreds of homes were destroyed leaving 35,000people homeless and there was severe damage in Tuxpan, Tamiahua, Pueblo Viejo, Platon, Pánuco, Tampico Alto, and elsewhere along the coast of northeast Mexico.|$|E
