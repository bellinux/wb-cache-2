5|$|Originally {{constructed}} by the Dinn Corporation, Mean Streak {{opened to the public}} on on May 11, 1991, as the tallest wooden coaster in the world with the longest <b>drop</b> <b>height.</b> Cedar Point closed Mean Streak on September 16, 2016, casting doubt and uncertainty regarding the ride's future. The park dropped subtle hints over the following year that the ride was being refurbished. On August 16, 2017, Cedar Point officially announced the conversion of Mean Streak into Steel Vengeance, marketed as the first hybrid hypercoaster. Before its official opening, a virtual recreation of the ride was made available in the video game, Planet Coaster.|$|E

Dollywood's Wild Eagle actually opened earlier on 24 March 2012, making it the first Wing Coaster in North America. On 13 August 2012, Cedar Point announced {{plans to build a}} new Wing Coaster called GateKeeper, which set new records for a Wing Coaster including longest track length, fastest speed and <b>drop</b> <b>height.</b> The first Wing Coaster in Asia, Parrot Coaster, opened at Ocean Kingdom on 25 January 2014. Thorpe Park announced that the last two rows of The Swarm would be turned backwards – a first for a Wing Coaster – for the 2013 season. On 24 July 2014, Holiday World & Splashin' Safari announced Thunderbird, the first launched Wing Coaster.|$|E
25|$|After {{the attack}} {{aircraft}} had finished their bombing runs the six transports, {{which had been}} holding in wait to the east, commenced their formation run towards Cassinga {{at an altitude of}} 200 feet (60 m). Shortly before reaching the base, the six aircraft climbed to , the <b>drop</b> <b>height,</b> and lined up for the drop. However, required visual 'tracking and distance' co-ordination markers were obscured by smoke from the bombing run, the drop zone (DZ) box scaling and drop point distances were incorrect - due to the reconnaissance scaling errors - and the drop was a shambles with nearly all the paratroopers being dropped off-target, some on the West side of the river and some into tall maize where they had problems linking up. The resultant confusion caused numerous delays, ruining the schedule of the 'drop-to-contact' plan, and much of the advantage of surprise. The disastrous drop also meant that it would be nearly an hour before C-Company was able to move into position on {{the eastern side of the}} camp and seal off the escape routes and as a result a number of top PLAN commanders, including Dimo Amaambo and Greenwell Matongo (two principal targets of the attack) escaped (with Amaambo later becoming the first head of the Namibian Defence Force in 1990).|$|E

40|$|In the literature, athletes {{preparing}} for explosive activities are recommended to include drop jumping in their training programs. For {{the execution of}} drop jumps, different techniques and different <b>dropping</b> <b>heights</b> can be used. This {{study was designed to}} investigate for the performance of bounce drop jumps the influence of <b>dropping</b> <b>height</b> on the biomechanics of the jumps. Six subjects executed bounce <b>drop</b> jumps from <b>heights</b> of 20 cm (designated here as DJ 20), 40 cm (designated here as DJ 40), and 60 cm (designated here as DJ 60). During jumping, they were filmed, and ground reaction forces were recorded. The results of a biomechanical analysis show no difference between DJ 20 and DJ 40 in mechanical output about the joints during the push-off phase. Peak values of moment and power output about the ankles during the push-off phase were found to be smaller in DJ 60 than in DJ 40 (DJ 20 = DJ 60). The amplitude of joint reaction forces increased with <b>dropping</b> <b>height.</b> During DJ 60, the net joint reaction forces showed a sharp peak on the instant that the heels came down on the ground. Based on the results, researchers are advised to limit <b>dropping</b> <b>height</b> to 20 or 40 cm when investigating training effects of the execution of bounce drop jumps...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the reliability of}} the Reactive Strength Index (RSI) and jump-height (JH) performance from multiple <b>drop</b> <b>heights</b> in an elite population. Methods: Thirteen professional basketball players (mean ±SD age 25. 8 ± 3. 5 y, height 1. 96 ± 0. 07 m, mass 94. 8 ± 8. 2 kg) completed 3 maximal drop-jump attempts onto a jump mat at 4 randomly assigned box heights and 3 countermovement-jump trials. Results: No statistical difference was observed between 3 trials for both the RSI and JH variable at all the tested <b>drop</b> <b>heights.</b> The RSI for drop-jump heights from 20 cm resulted in a coefficient of variation (CV) = 3. 1 % and an intraclass correlation (ICC α) =. 96, 40 cm resulted in a CV = 3. 0 % and an ICC α =. 95, and 50 cm resulted in a CV = 2. 1 % and an ICC α =. 99. The JH variable at the 40 -cm drop-jump height resulted in the highest reliability CV = 2. 8 % and an ICC α =. 98. Conclusion: When assessing the RSI the 20 -, 40 -, and 50 -cm <b>drop</b> <b>heights</b> are recommended with this population. When assessing large groups it appears that only 1 trial is required when assessing the RSI variable from the 20, 40 -, and 50 -cm <b>drop</b> <b>heights...</b>|$|R

500|$|At {{the time}} of its {{introduction}} in 2000, Son of Beast was the only wooden roller coaster nationally ranked in the top 10 for track height, track length, <b>drop</b> <b>height,</b> and speed. It set several world records becoming the tallest and fastest wooden roller coaster in the world, as well as becoming the second longest following its predecessor, The Beast. [...] Son of Beast was also the only wooden roller coaster to feature a vertical loop. The loop was removed prior to the 2007 season. Prior to its removal, the vertical loop also made Son of Beast the longest roller coaster in the world to contain one. Following its removal, California Screamin' at Disney California Adventure acquired the title.|$|E
40|$|An {{alternating}} {{cycle of}} negative-positive work phases {{in the lower}} legs during vertical jumps represents a sequence where storage and utilization of elastic energy takes place. It is possible that energy storage and its utilization depend on the stretch load capacity of activated muscles in legs. It {{is also possible that}} there may be a difference between trained and untrained subjects in stretch load capacity. To investigate these assumed differences and to evaluate the leg stretch load capacity, fourteen male subjects were assigned to either a trained (N = 7) or untrained (N = 7) group. All subjects performed two vertical jumps, drop jump and counter-movement jump, at four different heights (20, 35, 50 and 65 cm). A Locam 16 mm high speed camera was used to film the all movements during two vertical jump tests. A Sonic digitizer interfaced to VAX was used to digitize the film data in this study. As expected, the mechanical work, vertical force and vertical velocity during landing phase increased with the increase of <b>dropping</b> <b>height</b> for both of the groups. But, these selected biomechanical variables, including positive work, force, kinetic energy and jumping performance, during take-off phase for trained subjects increased when <b>dropping</b> <b>height</b> was increased from 20 to 50 cm,and then decreased when <b>dropping</b> <b>height</b> increased up to 65 cm; for untrained subjects increased when <b>dropping</b> <b>height</b> increased from 20 to 35 cm, and then decreased when <b>dropping</b> <b>height</b> up to 50 or 65 cm. In counter-movement test, the mechanical energy output during positive phase increased with increase of jumped heights. The results of present study revealed that the main effects of drop jump as one of the most popular plyometric drills to influence jumping performance are significant.
