5|$|Swedish {{used to have}} genitive {{that was}} placed {{at the end of}} the head of a noun phrase. In modern Swedish, it has become an <b>enclitic</b> -s, which {{attaches}} to the end of the noun phrase, rather than the noun itself.|$|E
5|$|Nouns {{can form}} noun phrases (NPs) {{where they are}} the {{syntactic}} head of the words that depend on them such as determiners, quantifiers, conjunctions or adjectives. Noun phrases can be short, such as the man, composed only of a determiner and a noun. They can also include modifiers such as adjectives (e.g. red, tall, all) and specifiers such as determiners (e.g. the, that). But they can also tie together several nouns into a single long NP, using conjunctions such as and, or prepositions such as with, e.g. the tall man with the long red trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles (this NP uses conjunctions, prepositions, specifiers and modifiers). Regardless of length, an NP functions as a syntactic unit. For example, the possessive <b>enclitic</b> can, in cases which do not lead to ambiguity, follow the entire noun phrase, as in The President of India's wife, where the <b>enclitic</b> follows India and not President.|$|E
5|$|Negation is {{done with}} the adverb not, which precedes the main verb and follows an {{auxiliary}} verb. A contracted form of not -n't {{can be used as}} an <b>enclitic</b> attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb to be. Just as with questions, many negative constructions require the negation to occur with do-support, thus in Modern English I don't know him is the correct answer to the question Do you know him?, but not *I know him not, although this construction may be found in older English.|$|E
5|$|Possession can be {{expressed}} either by the possessive <b>enclitic</b> -s (also traditionally called a genitive suffix), or by the preposition of. Historically the -s possessive {{has been used for}} animate nouns, whereas the of possessive has been reserved for inanimate nouns. Today this distinction is less clear, and many speakers use -s also with inanimates. Orthographically the possessive -s is separated from the noun root with an apostrophe.|$|E
25|$|Hurrian uses both <b>enclitic</b> and {{independent}} personal pronouns. The independent pronouns {{can occur in}} any case, whereas the <b>enclitic</b> ones represent only the absolutive. It is irrelevant {{to the meaning of}} the sentence to which word in the sentence the <b>enclitic</b> pronoun is attached, so it is often attached either to the first phrase or to the verb. The following table gives the attested forms of the personal pronouns, omitting those that cannot be determined.|$|E
25|$|An <b>enclitic</b> appears {{after its}} host.|$|E
25|$|These <b>enclitic</b> prepositions in Ge'ez {{are similar}} to the inseparable prepositions in Hebrew.|$|E
25|$|Lakota has {{a number}} of <b>enclitic</b> {{particles}} which follow the verb, many of which differ depending on whether the speaker is male or female.|$|E
25|$|A Turkish suffix can {{be called}} <b>enclitic</b> if its vowel {{undergoes}} vowel harmony, agreeing with the last vowel of the stem the suffix is attached to.|$|E
25|$|Kapampangan pronouns {{follow a}} certain order {{following}} verbs or particles like negation words. The <b>enclitic</b> pronoun is always first {{followed by another}} pronoun or discourse marker.|$|E
25|$|An {{even less}} common variant {{is used in}} the case of two people being addressed, namely, Namo vām, which is a {{combination}} of namaḥ and the <b>enclitic</b> 2nd person dual pronoun vām.|$|E
25|$|If a verb form is nominalised, e.g. {{to create}} a {{relative}} clause, then another suffix is used: -šše. Nominalised verbs can undergo Suffixaufnahme. Verb forms can also take other <b>enclitic</b> suffixes; see 'particles' below.|$|E
25|$|Distributive numbers {{carry the}} suffix -ate, e.g. kikate (by threes), tumnate (by fours). The suffix -āmha denotes multiplicatives, e.g. šināmha (twice), ēmanāmha (thrice). All {{cardinal}} numbers {{end in a}} vowel, which drops when an <b>enclitic</b> is attached.|$|E
25|$|English enclitics {{include the}} {{contracted}} versions of auxiliary verbs, as in I'm and we've. Some also regard the possessive marker, as in The Queen of England's crown as an <b>enclitic,</b> {{rather than a}} (phrasal) genitival inflection.|$|E
25|$|A {{less common}} variant {{is used in}} the case of three or more people being {{addressed}} namely Namo vaḥ which is a combination of namaḥ and the <b>enclitic</b> 2nd person plural pronoun vaḥ. The word namaḥ takes the Sandhi form namo before the sound v.|$|E
25|$|Words of one, two, {{or three}} {{syllable}}s have primary {{stress on the}} first syllable. In words of more than three syllables, the first syllable receives a primary stress while every syllable after receives a secondary stress, unless there was an <b>enclitic</b> present, which normally took the primary stress.|$|E
25|$|In general, the dialects {{that gave}} birth to Portuguese had a quite {{flexible}} use of the object pronouns in the proclitic or <b>enclitic</b> positions. In Classical Portuguese, the use of proclisis was very extensive, while, on the contrary, in modern European Portuguese the use of enclisis has become indisputably majoritary.|$|E
25|$|First {{and second}} person pronouns have both {{independent}} forms and dependent (<b>enclitic)</b> forms. The dependent forms are used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) {{and when it}} follows a noun (as possessor). The independent forms are used elsewhere (although there are some variations on this rule).|$|E
25|$|In {{western and}} {{southern}} Jutish dialects of Danish, æ {{is also the}} proclitic definite article: æ hus (the house), as opposed to Standard Danish and all other Nordic varieties which have <b>enclitic</b> definite articles (Danish, Swedish, Norwegian: huset, Icelandic, Faroese: húsið (the house)). The dialects are rarely committed to writing, except for some dialect literature.|$|E
25|$|The <b>enclitic</b> {{particles}} can {{be attached}} to any word in a sentence, but most often they {{are attached to the}} first phrase of the sentence or to the verb. They are much more diverse and frequent in the Mitanni letter than in Old Hurrian. Common ones include =ān (and), =mān (but), =mmaman (to be sure) and =nīn (truly!).|$|E
25|$|A last mark, {{which could}} either be the Tironian note ⁊ or the {{ampersand}} &, was used with equal frequency as the conjunction et (and) or as et in {{any part of}} the word. The symbol ⁊ {{at the end of a}} word indicates the <b>enclitic</b> -que (and). A corruption occurs in some manuscripts between it and the us/os mark.|$|E
25|$|Only a few sentence-initial {{particles}} are attested. In contract with nouns, which also end in /i/, the final vowel of the conjunctions ai (when) and anammi (therefore) is not dropped before an <b>enclitic</b> personal pronoun. Other conjunctions include alaše (if), inna (when), inu (like) and panu (although). Hurrian {{has only a}} small amount of adverbs. The temporal adverbs are henni (now), kuru (again) and unto (then). Also attested are atī (thus, so) and tiššan (very).|$|E
25|$|Sanskrit pronouns are {{declined}} for case, number, and gender. Many pronouns have alternative <b>enclitic</b> forms. The {{first and}} second person pronouns are declined {{for the most part}} alike, having by analogy assimilated themselves with one another. Ablatives in singular and plural may be extended by the syllable -tas; thus mat or mattas, asmat or asmattas. Sanskrit does not have true third person pronouns, but its demonstratives fulfil this function instead by standing independently without a modified substantive.|$|E
25|$|For {{all persons}} except {{the third person}} singular, the present tense is formed by the {{insertion}} of -i, and the proper <b>enclitic</b> pronominal ending: girin, girim, girir. As with the infinitive, -i causes an a or o in the stem to umlaut to e: pedin, pedim, pedir, from pad-. The third person singular, {{because it has a}} zero-ending, does not require the insertion of -i. This leaves the bare stem, which, because of Sindarin's phonological history, causes the vowel of the stem to become long: gîr, blâb, pâd.|$|E
25|$|Brazilians {{normally}} {{place the}} object pronoun before the verb (proclitic position), as in ele me viu ("he saw me"). In many such cases, the proclisis {{would be considered}} awkward or even grammatically incorrect in EP, in which the pronoun is generally placed after the verb (<b>enclitic</b> position), namely ele viu-me. However, formal BP still follows EP in avoiding starting a sentence with a proclitic pronoun; so both will write Deram-lhe o livro ("They gave him/her the book") instead of Lhe deram o livro, though it will seldom be spoken in BP (but would be clearly understood).|$|E
2500|$|... {{with the}} <b>enclitic</b> {{question}} word -e (e.g. Tudod-e, merre menjünk? ‘Do {{you know which}} way to go?’) ...|$|E
2500|$|The variant forms -me, -ma and -lle of {{the third}} person absolutive pronouns only before certain conjunctions, namely ai (when), inna (when), inu, unu (who), panu (though), and the {{relative}} pronouns iya and iye. When an <b>enclitic</b> personal pronoun {{is attached to a}} noun, an extensive system of sound changes determines the final form. The <b>enclitic</b> -nna {{of the third}} person singular [...] behaves differently from the other pronouns: when it is preceded by an ergative suffix it, unlike the other pronouns, combines with the suffix to form šša, whereas with all other pronouns the š of the ergative is dropped. Moreover, a word-final vowel /i/ changes to /e/ or /a/ when any <b>enclitic</b> pronoun other than -nna is attached.|$|E
2500|$|There are no case declensions in Danish nouns. [...] Nouns are inflected {{only for}} {{possession}} which is expressed with a possessive <b>enclitic,</b> for example min fars hus [...] "my father's house" [...] where the noun far carries the possessive <b>enclitic.</b> This is however {{not a case}} of genitive case marking, because in the case of longer noun phrases the -s attaches to the last word in the phrase, which need not be the head-noun or even a noun at all. For example, the phrases kongen af Danmark's bolsjefabrik [...] "the king of Denmark's candy factory", or det er pigen Uffe bor sammen meds datter [...] "that is the daughter of the girl that Uffe lives with", where the <b>enclitic</b> attaches to a stranded preposition.|$|E
2500|$|The {{interrogative}} particle (soru eki) is not written as a suffix, {{but it is}} <b>enclitic</b> (i.e., it exhibits vowel harmony): ...|$|E
2500|$|Telugu: idi nā puvvu = ఇది నా పువ్వు (This is my flower). With <b>enclitic</b> ē which {{indicates}} certainty, this sentence becomes ...|$|E
2500|$|Old Norse: The {{definite}} {{article was}} the <b>enclitic</b> -inn, -in, -itt (masculine, feminine and neuter nominative singular), as in álfrinn [...] "the elf", gjǫfin [...] "the gift", and tréit [...] "the tree", an abbreviated {{form of the}} independent pronoun hinn, cognate of the German pronoun jener. It was fully declined for gender, case and number. Since both the noun and <b>enclitic</b> were declined, this led to [...] "double declension". The situation remains similar in modern Faroese and Icelandic, but in Danish, Norwegian and Swedish, the enclitics have become endings.|$|E
2500|$|Tariana switch {{reference}} enclitics {{indicate whether}} {{the action of}} a dependent clause is simultaneous with or prior to {{the action of the}} main clause and whether the subject of the dependent clause is the same or different from the subject of the main clause. In rapid speech, the <b>enclitic</b> -hyume often becomes -yuhme or even -yume. -Kayami can be ponounced -kañami or -kayãmi. Note that there are several different enclitics for simultaneous action categories. [...] Each <b>enclitic</b> has various restrictions as to which other clitics and affixes with which it may combine and where it may fall within a clause or sentence.|$|E
2500|$|Simultaneity is {{expressed}} by iken or its (not <b>enclitic)</b> suffixed form -(y)ken; {{but if it}} follows a verb, then the verb appears, not as a stem, but as a base; see Bases of verbs: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Hurrian possessive pronouns cannot occur independently, but {{are only}} <b>enclitic.</b> They are {{attached}} to nouns or nominalised verbs. The form of the pronoun is dependent on that of the following morpheme. The table below outlines the possible forms: ...|$|E
2500|$|Namaste (Namas + te, Devanagari: नमस् + ते = नमस्ते) {{is derived}} from [...] Sanskrit and is a {{combination}} of the word nama and the second person dative pronoun in its <b>enclitic</b> form, te. The word namaḥ takes the Sandhi form namas before the sound t.|$|E
2500|$|The name is {{composed}} {{from the two}} elements melek(h) [...] "king" [...] and ṣedeq [...] "righteous(ness)". With {{the addition of the}} <b>enclitic</b> possessive pronoun (...) , malk-ī means [...] "my king", so that the name literally translates to [...] "my king is righteousness" [...] (or [...] "my king is Ṣedeq").|$|E
