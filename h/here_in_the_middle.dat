His father Alexander was a forester in Erasbach, and after 1717 head forester in Reichstadt (today Zákupy), Kreibitz (today Chřibská) and Eisenberg (today Jezeří), all in northern Bohemia. According to some biographers, it was <b>here,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of Lusatian Mountains, where 8-year-old Christoph received his first musical education at the Jesuit gymnasium in Komotau (today Chomutov).

2500|$|A German ethnic {{minority}} speaking the Cimbrian language, having {{settled in the}} mountains between Vicenza, Verona, and Trento in Italy (also known as Seven Communities), is also called the [...] For hundreds of years this isolated population and its present 4,400 inhabitants have {{claimed to be the}} direct descendants of the Cimbri retreating to this area after the Roman victory over their tribe. However, {{it is more likely that}} Bavarians settled <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Ages. Most linguists remain committed to the hypothesis of a medieval (11th to 12th century AD) immigration to explain the presence of small German-speaking communities in the north of Italy. Some genetic studies seem to prove a Celtic, not Germanic, descent for most inhabitants in the region that is reinforced by Gaulish toponyms such as those ending with the suffix -ago < Celtic -*ako(n) (e.g. Asiago is clearly the same place name as the numerous variants - Azay, Aisy, Azé, Ezy - in France, all of which derive from *Asiacum < Gaulish *Asiāko(n)). On the other hand, the original place names in the region, from the specifically localized language known as 'Cimbro' are still in use alongside the more modern names today. These indicate a different origin (e.g., Asiago is known also by its original Cimbro name of Sleghe). The Cimbrian origin myth was popularized by humanists in the 14th century.|$|E
