5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the shootings, Virginian governor Tim Kaine convened a panel consisting of various officials and experts to investigate and examine the response and handling of issues related to the shootings. The panel released its final report in August 2007, devoting more than 30 pages to detailing Cho's troubled history. In the report, the panel criticized the failure of the educators and mental health professionals who came into contact with Cho during his college years to notice his deteriorating condition and help him. The panel also criticized misinterpretations of privacy laws and gaps in Virginia's mental health system and <b>gun</b> <b>laws.</b> In addition, the panel faulted Virginia Tech administrators in particular for failing to take immediate action after the first shootings. Nevertheless, the report did acknowledge that Cho was still primarily responsible for not seeking assistance and for his murderous rampage.|$|E
5|$|Other {{proposals}} from Kelly and Giffords include {{limiting the}} sale of certain magazines, limiting {{the sale of}} assault weapons, and stopping gun trafficking. Mark Kelly was denied the sale of an AR-15 rifle. The shop owner denied Mr. Kelly the purchase stating his disagreement with Mr. Kelly's previous statements on <b>gun</b> <b>laws.</b> Local news reports that Mr. Kelly tried to buy the firearm using his Texas drivers license and thus could not prove Arizona residency. Mr. Kelly had stated that he was purchasing in order to turn the weapon in to the police department. In April 2013, Kelly was photographed at his mother-in-law's house in Arizona, with Giffords watching and cheering him on while he used a Glock 9 millimeter for target practice.

40|$|Relations {{between state}} <b>gun</b> <b>law</b> {{strength}} and state-aggregated levels of Republican leaning, gun ownership, and resident Big Five neuroticism (based on 619, 397 residents nationally) were determined in a state-level {{analysis of the}} 50 American states using multiple regression strategies with state socioeconomic status, white population percent, and urban population percent statistically controlled. In a standard hierarchical model with state <b>gun</b> <b>law</b> strength as the criterion, the three demographic variables accounted for 44. 4 % of the variance and the Big Five accounted for another 21. 9 %. When the Big Five entered stepwise after the demographics, neuroticism was the sole significant personality predictor, accounting for another 13. 4 % of the variance. Greater state <b>gun</b> <b>law</b> strength was associated with higher state resident neuroticism. Further hierarchical regression analyses showed that state Republican leaning and gun ownership could account separately and jointly for significant variance in state <b>gun</b> <b>law</b> strength but not with state resident neuroticism controlled...|$|R
