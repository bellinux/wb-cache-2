60|$|March felt reassured; nevertheless, <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> eyes {{very tight}} {{and held his}} breath.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> {{eyes and}} either could not {{or would not}} speak again.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> eyes, {{and kissed}} her, {{and his arms}} folded her closer and closer.|$|E
60|$|Ginger {{smiled at}} 'im; then <b>'e</b> <b>shut</b> <b>'is</b> eyes and dropped off to sleep.|$|R
60|$|Ginger {{smiled at}} ’im; then <b>’e</b> <b>shut</b> <b>’is</b> eyes and dropped off to sleep.|$|R
60|$|Bill {{looked at}} the butter and then 'e {{looked at the}} ten shillings on the table, and at last <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> <b>'is</b> eyes and gulped it down and {{put the money in}} 'is pocket.|$|R
60|$|The doctor seemed seized with a qualm of faintness; <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> mouth {{tight and}} nodded.|$|E
60|$|But Chet {{would not}} believe this. <b>He</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> teeth hard {{and looked at his}} chum.|$|E
60|$|Love is proverbially blind. The {{argument}} {{was more than}} sufficient. <b>He</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> eyes, metaphorically, and rushed upon his fate.|$|E
60|$|The {{silence is}} {{broken only by}} the snores of the young gentleman, whose mouth has fallen open, until a few distant shots half waken him. <b>He</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>his</b> mouth convulsively, and opens his eyes sleepily. A door is violently kicked outside; and the voice of Drinkwater is heard raising urgent alarm.|$|R
60|$|Jim said he hadn't been asleep; <b>he</b> just <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> eyes so <b>he</b> {{could listen}} better.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>shut</b> up <b>his</b> notes, and, {{steadily}} {{watching my}} face, {{waited for me}} to speak first.|$|R
60|$|Shere Khan's ears lay {{flat back}} on his head, and <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> eyes, for the blazing branch was very near.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> lips {{tight as}} though to say no more, and thereupon turned and went away from that place.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's mine--too. My sixty-fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh.' <b>He</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> lips firmly {{against the}} tide of visualised numbers that {{threatened}} to carry him along.|$|E
6000|$|... "’Picked {{it up on}} a book-stall,’ he ses; then <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> <b>’is</b> eyes an’ {{said his}} piece wonderful. It made me quite queer to listen to ’im. ’That’s how I feel,’ ses he, when he’d finished. ’Just {{strength}} enough to get to bed. Lend a hand, Bill, an’ go an’ fetch the doctor.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That’s bad," [...] said Mr. Tredgold, sympathetically. [...] "Has <b>he</b> tried <b>shutting</b> <b>his</b> {{eyes and}} {{counting}} sheep jumping over a stile?" ...|$|R
60|$|So <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> up <b>his</b> {{glass and}} went into his shell to make a note of the {{discovery}} of the world's end, and the nature of it.|$|R
60|$|His hands moulded ample {{curves of}} air. <b>He</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> eyes tight in delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought, Aunt Alice, I thought----" [...] he began, but {{at sight}} of the morose, heavy countenance lifted up to him, <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> mouth.|$|E
6000|$|Again <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> {{eyes and}} the watchers thought that all was done, till of a sudden once more he opened them and added in broken tones-- ...|$|E
6000|$|He shook again, all over. [...] "You rascal! You sad dog, sir! No, sir, faith, {{you must}} shut your eyes. Eh, madam, must <b>he</b> not <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> eyes?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The old taste, {{not a bit}} changed," [...] <b>he</b> murmured, <b>shutting</b> <b>his</b> eyes. [...] "Brings {{back the}} old ships, and the old messmates, and the old times, and Old England." ...|$|R
60|$|Many {{times did}} {{the face of}} Martin flush and pale as he listened. A vision of Paradise had been opened before him, but he felt that <b>he</b> must <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> face {{out for a}} moment, {{with the}} hand that again wandered over his forehead, and then it lowered on Redlaw, reckless, ruffianly, and callous.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> {{book when}} he saw Rollo and the guide, and put it away in his knapsack. At {{the same time he}} rose from his seat, saying,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He took me {{into the}} rose-garden. Was that Sir Thomas's idea? There couldn't {{have been a better}} setting, I'm sure. The roses looked lovely. Presently, I heard him gulp, and I was so sorry for him! I would have refused him then, and put him out of his misery, only I couldn't very well till he had proposed, could I? So, I turned my back, and sniffed at a rose. And, then, <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> eyes--I couldn't see him, but I know <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> eyes--and began to say his lesson." ...|$|E
60|$|Rupert said he didn't mind, {{and then}} <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> <b>'is</b> eyes {{and pretended to}} be asleep. His idea was to wait till George was asleep and then pinch 'is clothes; {{consequently}} 'is feelings when 'e opened one eye and saw George getting into bed with 'is clothes on won't bear thinking about. He laid awake for hours, and three times that night George, who was a very heavy sleeper, woke up and found Rupert busy tucking him in.|$|R
6000|$|... "Three-quarters of a yard," [...] Bruno {{replied with}} perfect solemnity. [...] "And I'm a little sorry too," [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>shutting</b> <b>his</b> eyes {{so as not}} to see that he was smiling.|$|R
60|$|Zachary's face darkened, he {{clenched his}} fists. Then <b>he</b> seemed to <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> anger into himself.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> mouth angrily as {{he watched}} her. She seemed to scorn the work she {{mechanically}} produced; yet the hose she made were as nearly perfect as possible.|$|E
60|$|The frown slowly {{left the}} visage of Jack Brace. <b>He</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> eyes, smiled benignly, and {{delivered}} {{a series of}} heavy puffs from the starboard side of his mouth.|$|E
6000|$|Dicky Weed didn't answer 'im. <b>He</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> eyes {{tight and}} then 'e jumps {{up all of}} a sudden. [...] "I've got it!" [...] he says. [...] "Where's that bag?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The man {{had such}} a shock," [...] she continued, [...] "that <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> up <b>his</b> house, gave up all his schemes for {{re-entering}} life, left England, and {{never set foot in}} the country again." ...|$|R
50|$|Upham {{discontinued}} his facsimile {{business in}} late 1863 {{and returned to}} selling stationery, perfume, and hair dye. His notes were still {{being used in the}} war-torn South by Union soldiers and other persons after <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> down <b>his</b> business.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then {{you must}} drag me thither,' <b>he</b> groaned, and <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> eyes as though with faintness, and doubtless he was {{somewhat}} faint.|$|R
