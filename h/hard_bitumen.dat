40|$|A flexible, {{waterproof}} {{material that}} will solidify in water {{has long been}} desired in civil engineering. We have developed {{a new class of}} material, called Aquaphalt, which has these and other desirable properties. Aquaphalt is composed of an asphalt emulsion, cement and a water-absorbing polymer. The components are liquid at ambient temperature and can therefore be pumped, but they form a gel almost instantly when mixed. The hardened mixture is similar to <b>hard</b> <b>bitumen,</b> and has very low water permeability, high ductility and good adhesion to other materials. Here we describe the characteristics of Aquaphalt, with particular emphasis on those properties that give it potential as a shock-absorbing, waterproof backfill material for tunnels and dams, and as an antiliquefaction agent for protection of buildings exposed to earthquake hazards...|$|E
40|$|In {{anticipation}} of the introduction of high modulus materials in the Swiss standards, a research project {{has been carried out}} for the evaluation of these bituminous mixtures. These mixtures make possible to reduce rut in base courses. With a temperature of 50 °C, three test sections (two with high modulus and one with a reference material for base layer), were built in a building for ALT and were submitted to traffic loads corresponding to those of heavy vehicles. The behaviour of the test sections corresponds to the results provided by laboratory test made with LCPC rutting tests. The section designed to have a strong rut resistance has no rut in the base layer. The two others sections present important permanent deformation, even the one using <b>hard</b> <b>bitumen</b> (in this last case, the mixture was mainly designed to have high fatigue resistance). A second experience shows that rutting increases strongly with addition of transverse loads...|$|E
40|$|Since {{more than}} ten years, the focuses on {{environmental}} aspects have lead to a need to adapt technical solutions for road applications regarding the sustainable development. In France, to answer to these preoccupations, the Enrobés à Module Elevé (EME - High Modulus Asphalt mixes, in english) give, since more than 20 years, an excellent solution to reduce the use of materials while maintaining a very long service life road structure. Similarly, the hot recycled asphalt mixes with high rate of RA (up to 50 %) had shown a good efficiency to improve the environmental aspect, while showing a good mechanical behaviour. This article presents the main characteristics of a job site which combine these two techniques, namely an EME with 50 and 65 % of RA content. The main keys of success are developed, in terms of homogeneity of RA (wearing course on motorway), preliminary laboratory mix design, new mixing plant with two separate drums, where one is specially dedicated to the re-heating of RA and quality control. This paper describes the asphalt mix performance of the different asphalt mixes, like complex modulus, fatigue and rutting resistances, (preliminary study, mix from the plant or obtained in laboratory). This study is well completed by some researches on {{the properties of the}} binders (original binder from RA, new added <b>hard</b> <b>bitumen</b> 10 / 20, recovered binder from recycled mix).

40|$|In {{this report}} we present the background, the {{scientific}} and experimental approach {{and the results of}} AFM experiments performed on two different batches of bitumen. The specific bitumen researched in this project has also been studied {{in the context of the}} InfraQuest project ‘Pragmatisch Healing Onderzoek’. It has been known for quite some time already that bitumen posessess a microstructure at the typical length scale of micrometers. This can be shown experimentally by imaging the bitumen surface with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). As is the case for many other engineering materials (e. g. steel), the microstructure will manifest itself by the macroscopic mechanical response of the material; thus on the typical length scales where it performs its load bearing function in pavement structures. Together with the hitherto not precisely specified properties of the many available bitumen grades, this justifies further research into the origin and properties of this microstructure. Here we also anticipate that a better understanding about the origin and properties of the bitumen microstructure will lead to improved bitumen grades (material appraisal) and possibly to better criteria for selecting a bitumen for a specific application. In the context of this research first the objectivity of the AFM imaging technique has to be established. Therefore two independent laboratories (TNO and CiTG, TU Delft) have prepared and conditioned bitumen samples for the AFM. All samples have been prepared from the same batch of bitumen. Then each laboratory has imaged its ‘home made ‘samples’ as well as the samples prepared at the other lab. The results appear to be qualitatively identical. Thus one may conclude that the microstructure of bitumen is a reproducible quantity. It was also found that the (thermal) conditioning of the bitumen (prior to imaging) has a significant impact on the microstructure observed. One may conclude from this that the sample conditioning procedure is a very important aspect in the AFM imaging process. In other words: an AFM image of bitumen is meaningless, unless the conditioning procedure of the samples is reported extensively. The next step was to find the influence of temperature on the observed bitumen microstructure. Identical samples have been prepared by TU Delft and both laboratories have imaged the microstructure as a function of temperature. A similar observation as stated before has been made: the microstructures observed by both laboratories were very similar. Moreover, it has been observed that the microstructure gradually disappears when the temperature is raised. However, even at the highest (experimental) temperatures (70 °C) traces of the microstructure remain visible. Apparently the ordering process that governs the bitumen microstructure has an associated interaction energy in the order of 400 kB, i. e. 30 - 40 meV (kB, Boltzmann constant). It was also found that (chemically) reclaimed bitumen (from an asphalt test beam) does show a microstructure as well. Surprisingly however, it was found that the microstructure of <b>harder</b> <b>bitumen</b> grades disappears at lower temperatures compared to softer bitumen grades. This is against the intuition that in <b>harder</b> <b>bitumen</b> molecules are more tightly bound together than in softer grades, and that for <b>harder</b> <b>bitumen</b> the microstructure would ‘melt’ (disappear) at higher temperatures. The molecular mobility appears to be higher in <b>harder</b> <b>bitumen</b> grade, hence they are anticipated to be better ‘healers’. Macroscopic fatigue test have shown similar trends.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand {{of crude oil}} will increase the price of petroleum asphalt. Indonesia has imported asphalt to meet the need for the annually road construction and maintenance. One solution to improving the rheological properties of bitumen is by adding the <b>harder</b> <b>bitumen</b> or other chemical compound to reduce dependence to petroleum asphalt. In Indonesia there is a source of natural asphalt in Buton Island, Sulawesi with huge amount of deposit that potentially could improve the rheological properties of Pen 60 / 70 Petroleum Asphalt. In order to obtain a better understanding on the contribution of Asbuton to the improvement of performance on rheological properties, this research used 19 variations of Asbuton and pen 60 / 70 petroleum bitumen. This variation is then subjected to the basic rheology test and the mechanistic test using Dynamic Shear Rheometer. The conclusion of basic rheological performance is obtained that mixture (Asbuton and 60 / 70 petroleum bitumen) will increase hardness of bitumen.  Conclusion on mechanistic rheological performance is that mixture (Asbuton and 60 / 70 petrol bitumen) will increase Performance Grade (PG) and Complex Shear Modulus (G*).

40|$|Reclaimed Asphalt (RA) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{fractions}} of raw materials used in road construction today. Probably over 90 % of the total RA in the Netherlands is being reused in new asphalt constructions. RA contains aggregates coated with very <b>hard</b> <b>bitumen</b> (penetration grade of 10 - 20). During service, the bituminous binder loses its flexibility and its intrinsic self-healing capability because of ageing. These parameters are critical for reconstructing new durable surface layers. Therefore it is very important to reintroduce the flexibility and the intrinsic self-healing capability of the RA. In order to achieve this goal, rejuvenation technology is developed in this paper to re-compound to the aged bitumen in the RA. A preliminary research has been conducted to evaluate the effect of different potential rejuvenators on aged bituminous binders by means of laboratory blending. Two types of laboratory aged bitumen and six types of rejuvenators were developed. The rheological properties were evaluated by using the Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR), and the chemical compositions were evaluated using the Infrared Spectrometry (FT-IR). The thermodynamic properties of the blended bitumen were evaluated using the Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measurements. It is shown that with the blending of the rejuvenator into the laboratory aged bitumen is a physical process, the bitumen can regain its flexibility with a lower complex shear modulus, a higher phase angle and a lower glass transition temperature. A softer rejuvenator shows a higher potential. No significant chemical change can be observed for the rejuvenated bitumen. This research is on-going to investigate the diffusion capabilities of rejuvenators on the field aged reclaimed asphalt and the fatigue and healing evaluation.

40|$|Organisers {{of extreme}} sports need to better {{understand}} the motivations of participants who are prepared to face significant injury and maybe even death on a regular basis. For example, being flipped from your motorcycle at speeds in excess of 300 km/h or sliding over a <b>hard</b> <b>bitumen</b> surface with no control, often resulting in broken bones, comprise simply one aspect of competition in an activity accepted as an extreme sport (Lewis, 2004). One might wonder do competitors simply suffer from a death-wish or, in fact, just the opposite. That is, they seek to live life to the very fullest and, in so doing, want to enjoy every possible minute. The intent of the study therefore, was to explore the phenomena more closely by determining the primary motivations for engagement of individuals in motorcycle road racing at an Australian Championship. This exploratory study was undertaken using grounded theory with one-on-one phone interviews the primary means of data collection. Advocates of motivational theory (Martens & Webber, 2002) posit that there are three primary types of internal and external motivation, as well as a form of amotivation. Study results indicated that all three intrinsic forms of motivation were experienced but only one extrinsic form was highlighted as significant by study participants. The three instrinsic motivators are the intrinsic motivation to know, to accomplish and to experience stimulation. Intrinsic motivation to know was demonstrated through learning how to ride their bike faster and smoother, resulting in faster lap times. Intrinsic motivation to accomplish occurred when riders derived satisfaction and pleasure from the experience which resulted in personal satisfaction and mastery. Intrinsic motivation to experience stimulation resulted from the respondents’ perception of pleasure, fun and excitement from participation. On the other hand, tangible extrinsic rewards were generally limited to riders who had access to a factory-backed motorcycle with the majority of riders considering they suffered financially as a consequence of their participation. Intangible extrinsic rewards revealed themselves in the form of deep, personal identification with the attainment of personal goals which, in turn, lead to personal growth and development. Interestingly, all four motivators were found to result in positive outcomes for the riders which they indicated kept them engaged in the high risk sport. Such results suggest that organisers of such competitive meets need be aware that prize money is not the major attractant for participants. Rather, the personal benefits derived by participants when motorcycle racing was the primary determinant of enduring engagement in this extreme sport...|$|E

The current practice of road construction agencies in Qatar is to utilize Marshall method of mix design {{to arrive at the}} best combination of aggregates, commonly crushed local limestone or imported Gabbro as coarse and fine aggregates and a mineral filler, and the 60 / 70 pen. grade bitumen.

40|$|In {{addition}} {{to the ability to}} withstand deformation at higher temperatures and the ability to resist cracking at lower temperatures, the ability to withstand load alternations, i. e. the fatigue resistance, is a property of asphaltic bitumens which can never be ignored for the area of road construction. For this reason the number of endurable load alternations up fracture N was investigated on asphaltic bitumens 0 / 11 having different compositions at four different test temperatures with the aid of tensile threshold tests using the principle of cross-classification. The binder content, the filler content and the type of bitumen were systematically varied with 0 / 11 asphaltic bitumens. Prismatic test bodies of asphaltic bitumen with sides of 40 x 40 x 160 mm were used for the tensile threshold tests. In the tensile threshold test, these prismatic test bodies were subjected in the direction of their longitudinal axis to a minimum stress corresponding to the cryogenic tensile stress relevant to the particular test temperature. Mechanical (traffic-load-conditioned) stresses, which were varied in four stages, were superimposed on to the cryogenic tensile stress as threshold loads. It has been established {{on the basis of the}} investigations that the fatigue resistance of asphaltic <b>bitumens</b> having <b>hard</b> or medium-hard <b>bitumen</b> as binder increases with increasing content of binder and with increasing content of filler. As a function of the temperature, the number of endurable load alternations reaches a maximum which is around - 20 C when using a soft bitumen and in the region of the freezing point of water when using a <b>harder</b> <b>bitumen.</b> An increase in the load brings about a reduction in the number of endurable load alternations up to fracture, whereby the reduction was exponential in form with the exponent being clearly dependent on the temperature, having a value of around - 5. 3 at - 30 C and around - 2. 6 at + 40 C.

Bimodal emulsions are a combination of one large bitumen size and a small one. For this study, <b>hard</b> penetration <b>bitumens</b> were used, B 35 / 50 and B 15 / 25, because they are the most difficult bitumen to emulsify and, consequently, the worst sedimentation values are expected.

40|$|AbstractProper {{description}} of asphalt mixtures behavior under long time load {{is one of}} the most important factors in analyses of strain and stress relations at low temperatures both from traffic and environmental loads. For example different models of thermal stress accumulation require different approaches of {{description of}} asphalt concrete. But in all cases it is required to describe its behavior under long time loading, which in some cases may be even longer than 10 000 seconds. This paper presents advantages and disadvantages of three different models used for description of the asphalt mixes behavior in low temperatures. The authors have chosen three following approaches: generalized models, which describe asphalt mixtures using one parameter – the stiffness modulus – designated for a specific temperature and time of loading; rheological models (represented by Burgers rheological model), which describe asphalt mixtures using two or more parameters at a discrete range of temperature but at a continuous range of time of loading and master curves models which describe asphalt mixtures in a continuous range of both temperature and time of loading. Parameters of presented models were obtained from laboratory three-point bending creep tests conducted on different asphalt mixtures: high modulus asphalt concretes (HMAC), conventional asphalt concretes (AC), stone matrix asphalt (SMA) and porous asphalt (PA). The bending creep tests were conducted at three temperatures: 0 °C, - 10 °C and - 20 °C for the time of loading of 2400 seconds according to the procedure developed at Gdansk University of Technology. In this study the authors presented parameters only for HMAC. Commonly used models assume that asphalt mixture is linear viscoelastic and thermorheologically simple material.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{research}} reports FA 07. 101 G 82 B and FA 07. 136 G 87 B, an investigation was subsequently carried out to determine to what extent the binder characteristics of the asphalt surfaces have further changed after 12 to 15 years of lifetime and whether these results can be reached using the laboratory forecast methods 'Modelltopf' (model pot). For this purpose test cores from 30 asphalt layers were investigated to determine their binding characteristics. Tests were carried out on asphalt concrete, asphaltic mastic and asphalt bearing courses with bitumen B 80, B 65 or B 45. The ageing of the bitumen was directly dependent on the type of bitumen in a magnitude which covers more than two types (#DELTA# Ep. R. u. K. #approx# 20 C). It was obvious here that the cavity content played a particular role in the binder ageing. The fact that, despite strong binder ageing also in the case of <b>harder</b> types of <b>bitumen</b> (B 45), damage to roads does not necessarily occur, {{can be seen as a}} positive finding of the investigation results. Hence, the findings allow the conclusion to be made that the use of harder binders certainly is worthwhile in practice. This can minimise the problem of deformations without anticipating the formation of cracks due to binder ageing. The respective climatic conditions certainly have to be taken into consideration in choosing the binder. The ageing forecasts in the laboratory cannot, without further knowledge, be applied to behaviour in practice. On the contrary, practice shows that the combined effects of many circumstances always shapes the binder ageing in the course of a road being exposed and leads to great fluctuations, which makes a laboratory forecast difficult.

40|$|The current {{interest}} in energy saving asphalt production techniques is great and several new processes {{have been developed}} to reduce the mixing and compaction temperatures for hot mix asphalt. In particular, mastic asphalt products (Gussasphalt) require high working temperatures, and <b>harder</b> requirements concerning <b>bitumen</b> fumes and carbon dioxide emissions have been introduced for such products. Consequently, the need of a new means of producing and placing mastic asphalt at lower temperatures is particularly large. One way of reducing asphalt mixture temperature is by using special flow improving additives like wax. This technique has successively been tried in several studies for polymer modified mastic asphalt used for bridge decks and parking areas in Sweden. However, there still are uncertainties about possible negative impact on crack susceptibility at lower temperatures due to the addition of wax. In this study, 4 % montan wax (Asphaltan A) was used for one particular polymer modified mastic asphalt product. Type and amount of wax additive was selected based on results from earlier studies. The impact on binder, binder/filler mixtures and mastic asphalt from production was tested in the laboratory, focusing on low temperature performance. The bending beam rheometer (BBR) was used for determining low temperature creep compliance and the tensile stress restrained specimen test (TSRST) for determining fracture temperatures. Binder properties were determined using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and conventional tests (softening point, penetration, elastic recovery, Fraass breaking point, viscosity and storage stability). Aging was performed using the rolling thin film oven test (RTFOT) at 200 °C. As expected, the addition of wax to the polymer modified binder showed a viscosity reduction at higher temperatures, corresponding to a similar positive effect of more than 10 °C on production and laying temperature for the mastic asphalt. DMA and BBR results showed some increase in stiffness and a more elastic response of the wax modified binder at medium and low temperatures. The TSRST fracture temperature was 5 °C higher for the mastic asphalt containing 4 % wax, indicating however no dramatic negative impact on crack susceptibility...|$|R
