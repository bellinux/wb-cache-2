5|$|Because {{it is so}} {{far from}} the nearest major landmass, the <b>ecosystem</b> of Kohala has {{experienced}} the phenomenon of geographic isolation, resulting in an <b>ecosystem</b> radically different from that of other places. Invasive species introduced by man present a problem to Kohala's <b>ecosystem,</b> as they push native species out of their habitat. There are several initiatives to preserve Kohala's <b>ecosystem.</b> Crops, especially sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), have been harvested on the Leeward side of the volcano for centuries as well. The northern part of the island is named after the mountain, with two districts named North and South Kohala. King Kamehameha I, the first King of the Kingdom of Hawaii, was born in North Kohala, near Hawi.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} {{biennial}} {{reports from the}} U.S. National Research Council have reviewed the progress of CERP. The fourth report in the series, released in 2012, found that little {{progress has been made}} in restoring the core of the remaining Everglades ecosystem; instead, most project construction so far has occurred along its periphery. The report noted that to reverse ongoing <b>ecosystem</b> declines, it will be necessary to expedite restoration projects that target the central Everglades, and to improve both the quality and quantity of the water in the <b>ecosystem.</b> To better understand the potential implications of the current slow pace of progress, the report assessed the current status of ten Everglades <b>ecosystem</b> attributes, including phosphorus loads, peat depth, and populations of snail kites, birds of prey that are endangered in South Florida. Most attributes received grades ranging from C (degraded) to D (significantly degraded), but the snail kite received a grade of F (near irreversible damage). The report also assessed the future trajectory of each <b>ecosystem</b> attribute under three restoration scenarios: improved water quality, improved hydrology, and improvements to both water quality and hydrology, which helped highlight the urgency of restoration actions to benefit a wide range of <b>ecosystem</b> attributes and demonstrate the cost of inaction. Overall, the report concluded that substantial near-term progress to address both water quality and hydrology in the central Everglades is needed to reverse ongoing degradation before it is too late.|$|E

Previously we found that biodiversity rapidly declined in experimental exotic communities because the mechanisms that maintained diversity in experimental native communities were reduced.

5|$|The {{underlying}} {{concept of}} <b>ecosystem</b> {{can be traced}} back to 1864 in the published work of George Perkins Marsh ("Man and Nature"). Within an <b>ecosystem,</b> organisms are linked to the physical and biological components of their environment to which they are adapted. Ecosystems are complex adaptive systems where the interaction of life processes form self-organizing patterns across different scales of time and space. Ecosystems are broadly categorized as terrestrial, freshwater, atmospheric, or marine. Differences stem from the nature of the unique physical environments that shapes the biodiversity within each. A more recent addition to <b>ecosystem</b> ecology are technoecosystems, which are affected by or primarily the result of human activity.|$|E
40|$|Recent, {{parallel}} {{developments in}} the study of freshwater and marine <b>ecosystems</b> have provided evidence that net heterotrophic systems (those in which respiratory organic matter destruction exeeds photosynthetic production) are more prevalent than hitherto believed, including most rivers, oligo- to mesotrophic lakes and some oligotrophic regions of the ocean. In parallel, these aquatic <b>ecosystems</b> have been shown to act as CO 2 sources to the atmosphere, as expected from the heterotrophic nature of the communities they contain. The prevalence of net heterotrophic aquatic <b>ecosystems</b> indicates that they must receive significant inputs of organic carbon from adjacent <b>ecosystems,</b> assigning an important role to the lateral exchanges of carbon between land and aquatic <b>ecosystems,</b> between coastal and open ocean <b>ecosystems,</b> as well as internal redistribution within large or complex aquatic <b>ecosystems</b> in determining their metabolic status and the gaseous exchange with the atmosphere. The examination of the carbon budget of <b>ecosystems</b> requires, therefore, an integrative approach that accounts for exchanges between compartments often studied in isolation.

40|$|This work {{highlights}} the importance of green spaces in an urban environment not only for human and his activities, but especially for the biotic element of environment. To these artificial <b>ecosystems,</b> despite their non-productive function, people provide deluxe services such as irrigation and fertilization.

The work focuses on the issue of expansion of non-native plant and animal species and extrusion of native species from their natural habitat. By this process the native species are highly threatened in urban environments.

5|$|Olson {{made many}} inferences on the paleoecology of the Texas Red beds {{and the role}} of Dimetrodon within its <b>ecosystem.</b> He {{proposed}} several main types of ecosystems in which the earliest tetrapods lived. Dimetrodon belonged to the most primitive <b>ecosystem,</b> which developed from aquatic food webs. In it, aquatic plants were the primary producers and were largely fed upon by fish and aquatic invertebrates. Most land vertebrates fed on these aquatic primary consumers. Dimetrodon was probably the top predator of the Red Beds <b>ecosystem,</b> feeding on a variety of organisms such as the large shark Xenacanthus, the aquatic amphibians Trimerorhachis and Diplocaulus, and the terrestrial tetrapods Seymouria and Trematops. Insects are known from the Early Permian Red Beds and were probably involved to some degree in the same food web as Dimetrodon, feeding small reptiles like Captorhinus. The Red Beds assemblage also included some of the first large land-living herbivores like Edaphosaurus and Diadectes. Feeding primarily on terrestrial plants, these herbivores did not derive their energy from aquatic food webs. According to Olson, the best modern analogue for the <b>ecosystem</b> Dimetrodon inhabited is the Everglades. The exact lifestyle of Dimetrodon (amphibious to terrestrial) has long been controversial, but bone microanatomy supports a terrestrial lifestyle, which implies that it would have fed mostly on land, on the banks, or in very shallow water. Evidence also exists for Dimetrodon preying on aestivating Diplocaulus during times of drought, with three partially eaten juvenile Diplocaulus in a burrow of eight bearing teeth marks from a Dimetrodon that unearthed and killed them.|$|E
