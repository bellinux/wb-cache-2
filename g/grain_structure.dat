25|$|Roll forging is {{a process}} where round or flat bar stock is reduced in {{thickness}} and increased in length. Roll forging is performed using two cylindrical or semi-cylindrical rolls, each containing one or more shaped grooves. A heated bar is inserted into the rolls and when it hits a spot the rolls rotate and the bar is progressively shaped as it is rolled through the machine. The piece is then transferred to {{the next set of}} grooves or turned around and reinserted into the same grooves. This continues until the desired shape and size is achieved. The advantage of this process is there is no flash and it imparts a favorable <b>grain</b> <b>structure</b> into the workpiece.|$|E

In the present work, we proposed the automatic modeling of a kinetic Monte-Carlo (KMC) simulation to treat an asymmetric <b>grain</b> boundary <b>structure</b> that corresponds to target samples used in fusion material experiments for retention and permeation. In this method, local minimum energy sites and migration paths for impurity atoms in the <b>grain</b> boundary <b>structure</b> are automatically found using localized molecular dynamics.

2500|$|Micro{{extrusion}} is a microforming extrusion process {{performed at}} the submillimeter range. Like extrusion, metal is pushed through a die orifice, but the resulting product's cross section can fit through a 1mm square. Several microextrusion processes have been developed since microforming was envisioned in 1990. Forward (ram and billet move in the same direction) and backward (ram and billet move in the opposite direction) microextrusion were first introduced, with forward rod-backward cup and double cup extrusion methods developing later. Regardless of method, {{one of the greatest}} challenges of creating a successful microextrusion machine is the manufacture of the die and ram. [...] "The small size of the die and ram, along with the stringent accuracy requirement, needs suitable manufacturing processes." [...] Additionally, as Fu and Chan pointed out in a 2013 state-of-the-art technology review, several issues must still be resolved before microextrusion and other microforming technologies can be implemented more widely, including deformation load and defects, forming system stability, mechanical properties, and other size-related effects on the crystallite (<b>grain)</b> <b>structure</b> and boundaries.|$|E

A selection of numerical simulation results illustrates the capability of the phase-field model to recover a variety of complex experimental growth structures. In particular, the discretized model is used to simulate the microstructure evolution in eutectic, peritectic and monotectic alloys.

40|$|Abnormal {{grain growth}} in ODS superalloys, {{which leads to}} the desired coarse <b>grain</b> <b>structures,</b> was examined. A heat {{treatment}} in a temperature gradient (i. e. zone annealing) causes directional grain growth producing very elongated <b>grain</b> <b>structures.</b> Two temperature limits were determined which control the abnormal grain growth process: an "initiation temperature" (T(aKw)) which must be reached to initiate the process, and a "minimum temperature" (T(w)) required to maintain abnormal growth. T(w) is always lower than T(aKw) both of which define the temperature range in which abnormal grain growth occurs continuously during zone annealing without the "nucleation" of new coarse grains. The physical explanation of these two temperatures is associated with the mechanisms of the onset and the propagation of abnormal grain growth. These mechanisms can be best understood by the influence of foreign atoms on grain boundary motion (impurity-drag theory) ...|$|R

Results for varying ratios of the solid-solid interface energy to solid-liquid interface energy and varying solid volume fractions are presented. A variety of microstructures, from fully connected <b>grain</b> <b>structures</b> with liquid pockets at the grain junctions to individual grains fully wetted by the liquid matrix, is seen. The 3 main mechanisms for particle shape accommodation, namely, contact flattening, Ostwald ripening and particle bonding, are reproduced in the simulations.

In this paper, the model formulation, application and simulation results are compared for two of these approaches.

Then, simulation results obtained with both models, using equivalent model parameters, are compared for <b>grain</b> <b>structures</b> in 2 D and 3 D. The evolution of the individual grains, grain boundaries and triple junction angles is followed in detail. Moreover, the simulation results obtained with both approaches are compared using analytical theories and previous simulation results as benchmarks. We find that both models give essentially the same results, except for differences in the structure near small shrinking grains which are most often locally and temporary for large <b>grain</b> <b>structures.</b> (C) 2009 Elsevier B.

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the formation of}} bimodal ferrite <b>grain</b> <b>structures</b> (i. e. mixed coarse + fine grain sizes) in TMCR HSLA steel plates, as-continuously cast HSLA steel slabs with varying microalloying additions (Ti, Nb and V) were reheated to temperatures in the range 1000 - 1300 Â°C and deformed at 1110 Â°C and 980 Â°C temperatures in Gleeble 3500. The interdendritic segregation during continuous casting and the consequent inhomogeneous microalloying precipitate distributions (with interdendritic regions being the precipitate-rich regions) has resulted in severely bimodal austenite <b>grain</b> <b>structures</b> under certain reheat conditions (due to the significantly higher pinning force in solute-rich regions compared to solute-poor regions). The segregation of microalloying elements can also promote bimodality during deformation by affecting the local recrystallisation kinetics. Notch-bend fracture tests were performed at â 160 Â°C to investigate {{the effect of a}} bimodal grain size distribution on fracture toughness by comparing local fracture stress values for uniformly fine, uniformly coarse and bimodal ferrite <b>grain</b> <b>structures.</b> Analysis of local fracture stress values suggests that bimodality can raise the scatter in the fracture test results and therefore, it is undesirable. Current methods of measuring bimodality are not useful at consistently quantifying small differences in bimodality between microstructures of steel, and hence, two easy-to-measure parameters (peak height ratio, PHR and peak grain size range, PGSR) have been suggested in this study to quantify bimodality in HSLA steels.
