5000|$|The sheer {{richness}} {{and complexity of}} the artist’s work over four decades is open to continual further characterization. As an artist working from a core principle, often with strong conceptual aspects, his inner focus and dialogue within a given medium allows him high variability and unpredictability. Working with one or more principles at a time (e.g., the physicality of the medium and of languaging and imaging; liminality or the intense space between contraries and extremes of appearance), he can make it happen on multiple planes simultaneously—physical, personal, ontological, social, political—without reification of any one of them. Result: a singular event of reflexive speaking that marries mind and machine beyond any notion of reference as such—no stable signifier or signified, yet intense engagement at personal, emotional, and intellectual levels. Later works in computer animation—e.g., Liminal Objects (1995-), <b>Frustrum</b> (2006)—challenge one’s sense of “object” and mind-body boundaries and the very basis of our “reality.” Major projective installations—Tall Ships (1992), HanD HearD (1995-96), Viewer (1996), Wall Piece (2000), Up Against Down (2008)—raise these issues of physicality, objectivity, polyvalent signification, and language itself to a further human dimension—a principle of torsional engagement both within one’s own mind and body and up against the surface and face of the other. [...] He was influenced by the intellectual orientation of conceptual art which dominated art of the 1970s, but he instinctively evolved beyond the conceptual as such, working into a refined domain of principle that put him in full processual and open dialog both with electronic media and the language of thinking. His reading of the fiction and philosophical literary essays of Maurice Blanchot, in particular, provided him with ideas relating {{to the way in which}} language impinges on phenomenological experience, and a notion of 'the other'. Such reading informs Hill's visual-poetic explorations of the interrelationships between language, image, identity, and the body. For example, in Cabin Fever he uses the binary opposition of light and darkness to convey the notion of an interaction between a self and an ‘other’. He has also explored immersive environments, as seen in his 1992 piece Tall Ships.Hill's work thoroughly exploits the capacity of video to offer complex nonlinear narratives that encourage active engagement on the part of the viewer. In Roland Barthes' terms, Hill’s video narratives can be understood as ‘writerly’ texts.|$|E
40|$|Objectives:The aim of {{the study}} was to compare a novel {{infrared}} optoelectronic system (Perometer) of limb volume measurement with water displacement and two indirect measurement techniques. Design:A prospective experimental study. Methods:In 10 healthy male volunteers (20 limbs) we compared limb volume measurements obtained by water displacement, infrared perometry, the disc model method and the <b>frustrum</b> method. In a further 17 patients with swollen limbs due to lymphatic (9 limbs) or venous (11 limbs) disease, perometry was compared to the disc model method and the <b>frustrum</b> method only. Results:In normal limbs, mean ± s. d. limb volume using water displacement was 1802 ± 268 ml. Perometer values agreed almost exactly (1809 ± 262 ml, r = 0. 97, variation ± 7 % by limits of agreement) but both the disc (1923 ± 306 ml, r = 0. 90, variation ± 14 %) and <b>frustrum</b> (1905 ± 372 ml, r = 0. 72, variation ± 28 %) methods significantly overestimated limb volumes (p < 0. 05 (ANOVA, Fisher's Least Significant Difference). In diseased limbs perometer, disc method and <b>frustrum</b> method results were 2415 ± 995 ml, 2494 ± 969 ml, and 2413 ± 870 ml representing variation of ± 17 % and ± 23 % for disc method and <b>frustrum</b> method respectively compared to perometry. Conclusions:Perometry is a novel, extremely accurate and easy method for assessing limb volume. It provides more accurate results than traditional indirect measurement of limb volume and potentially is a very useful clinical and research tool...|$|E

The stresses also decrease as we go from the equatorial region to the apex. Because heart muscles physically have residual stresses, the consequent lower stress gradient through the wall enhances the diastolic function of the left ventricle. 1 Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ 07102 2 Center for Applied Mathematics and Statistics, New Jersey I [...] ...|$|E

Since the anchoring energy dominates when the thickness of the film is small, it is essential to understand its influence on the structure of the minimizers of the limiting energy. In particular, the anchoring energy dictates the class of admissible competitors and the structure of the limiting problem. We assume general weak anchoring conditions on the top and the bottom surfaces of the film and strong Dirichlet boundary conditions on the lateral boundary of the film when the surface is not closed.

This paper reports experimental measurements of shock standoff distance for the 70 deg cone AOTV configuration in shock-tunnel-test flows at Mach numbers of 3. 8 to 7. 9 and for angles of attack from 0 deg to 20 deg. The controlling parameter for hypersonic bow-shock standoff distance (for a given forebody shape) is the mean normal-shock density ratio.

It is concluded that the AOTV shock standoff distance for the conical configuration, based on <b>frustrum</b> (base) radius, is equivalent to that of a sphere with a radius about 35 percent greater than that of the cone; the distance is, therefore, much less than reported in previous studies.

40|$|AIM: The aim of {{this paper}} was to examine the {{reliability}} and validity of a new measurement device that counters the disadvantages of the traditional method of arm circumference measurements. METHODS: We measured the arm on the non-operated side of breast cancer patients. Sixty-four patients were measured twice by the same assessor and 48 patients were measured twice by two different assessors. The arm circumferences were measured at the olecranon and each 4 cm proximal and distal of the olecranon. The measurements were performed with a self-developed device consisting of a stainless steel bar on which a tapeline was fixed at every 4 cm distance. The arm volume was calculated from the circumference measurements with the <b>frustrum</b> formula and was also measured directly with the water displacement method. RESULTS: For the circumference measurements, intrarater and interrater ICCs ranged between 0. 942 and 0. 998. ICCs for the calculated arm volume were also very high. No systematic changes between the first to the second assessment could be found. The standard error of measurement for the circumference measurements as well as for the calculated arm volume was low (between 0. 8 % and 2. 0 %). An increase of 1. 0 cm or more of the arm circumference at any measurement side and of 55 ml or more of the calculated arm volume was clinically significant.

All measurements were performed under ultra-high vacuum conditions. As surfactants gallium, bismuth, and atomic hydrogen were used. In case of Ga, the influence of surface reconstruction on epitaxy has been studied. X-ray standing waves results prove, that during growth on the Ga:Si(111) - 6. 3 x 6. 3 surface Ga segregates {{on the surface and}} a discommensurate reconstruction with Ga atoms in substitutional sites is formed. In contrast, Ge deposition on the Ga:Si(111) -(#sq root#(3) x #sq root#(3)) -R 30 surface results in change of Ga adsorption site from T_ 4 to substitutional, which leads to a partially Ga-free surface and thus explains the break-down of surfactant mediated epitaxy on Ga:Si(111) -(#sq root#(3) x #sq root#(3)) -R 30 reported in the literature.

40|$|Summary of the thesis: Computer {{modeling}} of neuromodulation {{in the management}} of chronic pain by: Ljubomir Manola Neuromodulation is an important and frequent therapy applied, among others, {{in the management of}} chronic pain. Neuromodulation is defined as â€œa therapeutic alteration of activity in the central, peripheral or autonomic nervous systems, electrically or pharmacologically, by means of implanted devicesï¿½ï¿½?. It encompasses a focal, minimal invasive and reversible approach. Due to its invasive character with some more risks than other modalities of pain treatment, neuromodulation is generally applied as the last option when all other therapies have failed. The overall success rate of this treatment modality is about 50 %. It is often the only modality that may help a particular patient. However, there are still many chronic pain patients in whom neuromodulation was attempted with suboptimal or even less than satisfactory results. For the sake of this pool of patients it is an imperative to understand the effects occurring during a neuromodulation therapy and to design stimulation {{in such a way that}} a larger number of patients can be treated, while giving them an improved satisfaction with the therapy. This thesis is focused on spinal cord and motor cortex stimulation therapies for chronic, otherwise intractable pain management. The influence of various stimulation and volume conductor parameters on the neural response was investigated by means of realistic computer models. In Chapter 1 neuromodulation is presented as one of the treatment modalities for the management of various chronic pain syndromes. Further, the clinical methods named spinal cord stimulation and motor cortex stimulation are introduced. Details are given on working hypotheses (when existing), main indications, surgical procedures and technical aspects, difficulties and challenges encountered in the therapies. The chapter is completed by introducing the computer model as an invaluable tool to mimic/simulate the biophysical effects of neurostimulation. The technical performance of two different lead types commonly used in the clinical practice of spinal cord stimulation, the paddle (or surgical) lead and the percutaneous lead has been modeled and evaluated in Chapter 2. In addition to the thickness of the dorsal cerebrospinal fluid and the lead distance from the dura mater, the contact spacing on the lead was identified as the most important parameter influencing the performance. Despite a similar contact spacing and technical performance, a superior clinical performance of paddle leads was observed in clinical practice. This superiority is most likely attributable to the larger volume of a paddle and a consequent ventral displacement of the dura mater. The secure fixation of the paddle in close contact with the dura mater is most likely an additional factor determining the superior clinical performance as discussed in the chapter. In Chapter 3 the technical performance of percutaneous leads for spinal cord stimulation having various contact spacings is modeled and compared. While reducing the contact spacing the recruitment of dorsal column fibers is increased, though with larger energy expenditure. The effect on the recruitment of dorsal root fibers is opposite. Modelling predicts that a displacement of the lead dorsally or laterally in the dorsal epidural space results in a reduction of the ratio of dorsal root and dorsal column fiber thresholds and thereby in less paresthesia coverage (when the stimulus is just at the discomfort threshold). When two leads are connected in parallel modelling predicts that dorsal column recruitment is reduced. This prediction has recently been confirmed empirically. Owing to technical advances the concept of electrical field steering has recently emerged in spinal cord stimulation. A method to electronically shift the electrical field rostrocaudally along the spinal cord, resulting in predictable changes in the population of recruited sensory nerve fibres and thus the position of paresthesia is described in Chapter 4. It is predicted that a smaller contact spacing allows a better control of the stimulation field. This may be crucial in the treatment of pain syndromes such as chronic low-back pain, as discussed in this chapter. In Chapter 5, the first model of electrical stimulation of human motor cortex is introduced. The region of the precentral gyrus and surrounding sulci with an electrode array (paddle lead) on the overlying dura mater represents the core of the modelâ€™s volume conductor. A simple fiber model was taken from the spinal cord stimulation model and used to assess the neural response to the stimulation induced field. It was predicted that the thickness of the cerebrospinal fluid layer underneath the active contact influences the stimulation threshold considerably. In addition, nerve fibers oriented perpendicular to an anode above the cortical surface could be activated at a low amplitude. As a consequence, an anode cannot be considered an indifferent contact in motor cortex stimulation, contrary to common belief. A refined and extended model of motor cortex stimulation is described in Chapter 6. When the myelinated axon model was extended with a <b>frustrum</b> and another cylindrical membrane structure, representing a pyramidal cell and its apical dendrite, respectively, the stimulation threshold was generally reduced. By changing the polarity and/or position of the stimulating contact array, stimulation thresholds of pyramidal cells varied and the population of recruited cells was changed as well. The model predictions have been shown to be qualitatively in accordance with empirical data from the literature. Finally, the thesis is completed in Chapter 7 with a discussion of the most prominent effects in spinal cord and motor cortex stimulation that have been analyzed by computer modeling. In addition, recommendations for future theoretical and empirical studies are proposed...|$|E
