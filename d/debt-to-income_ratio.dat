50|$|In the United States, a {{conforming}} loan is {{a mortgage}} loan that conforms to GSE (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) guidelines. The most well-known guideline {{is the size}} of the loan, which as of 2017 was generally limited to $424,100 for single family homes in the continental US. Other guidelines include borrower's loan-to-value ratio (i.e. the size of down payment), <b>debt-to-income</b> <b>ratio,</b> credit score and history, documentation requirements, etc.|$|E
5000|$|The {{borrower}} {{is typically}} asked for their {{social security number}} or other identifier, together with proof of their employment, income and assets, which is weighed against the monthly payments being made on their current debts. This provides a general picture of their credit worthiness. Based on this initial information, a maximum loan amount will be determined according to a standard <b>Debt-to-income</b> <b>ratio</b> (DTI). Final approval of the loan will require a credit report from a credit bureau.|$|E
40|$|The United States {{experienced}} {{two major}} economic crises {{over the past}} 100 years-the Great Depression of 1929 and the Great Recession of 2007. Income inequality {{may have played a}} role in the origins of both income inequality may {{have played a role in}} the origins of both.

50|$|Low LTV ratios (below 80%) {{carry with}} them lower rates for lower-risk borrowers and allow lenders to {{consider}} higher-risk borrowers, such as those with low credit scores, previous late payments in their mortgage history, high <b>debt-to-income</b> <b>ratios,</b> high loan amounts or cash-out requirements, insufficient reserves and/or no income. Higher LTV ratios are primarily reserved for borrowers with higher credit scores and a satisfactory mortgage history. Full financing, or 100% LTV, is reserved for only the most credit-worthy borrowers. The loans with LTV ratios higher than 100% are called underwater mortgages.|$|R
50|$|Second, the {{potential}} lender assesses the prospective home buyer for risk. The analysis of one's <b>debt-to-income</b> <b>ratio</b> enables the buyer {{to know what}} type of home can be afforded based on monthly income and expenses and is one risk metric considered by the lender. Other factors, e.g. payment history on other debts, are considered and used to make decisions regarding eligibility and terms for a loan. FHA loans for buyers who don't meet a minimum 640 FICO score {{may be subject to}} higher mortgage rates.|$|E
50|$|The {{loans are}} {{personal}} loans or SME loans and range between €1,000 - €150,000 in Germany. The interest fee is calculated {{on the basis}} of the borrower’s credit score, credit history, desired loan amount and the borrower’s <b>debt-to-income</b> <b>ratio.</b> Lendico determines whether the borrower is creditworthy and assigns to its approved loans a credit grade that determines the payable interest rate and the fees. The loan period can range between 1 and 5 years and be repaid at any time. Only 10% of applications are received on the platform.|$|E
50|$|Failure to {{disclose}} liabilities: Borrowers may conceal obligations, such as mortgage loans on other properties or newly acquired credit card debt, {{to reduce the}} amount of monthly debt declared on the loan application. This omission of liabilities artificially lowers the <b>debt-to-income</b> <b>ratio,</b> which is a key underwriting criterion used to determine eligibility for most mortgage loans. It is considered fraud because it allows the borrower to qualify for a loan which otherwise would not have been granted, or to qualify for a bigger loan than what would have been granted had the borrower's true debt been disclosed.|$|E
40|$|The high <b>debt-to-income</b> <b>ratios</b> {{and the low}} {{financial}} literacy levels among Canadian immigrants are hindering public welfare, macroeconomic policies, and economic growth.

Based on longitudinal data we assess the effects of morbidity and mortality episodes on household income, medical spending, labour supply and consumption. We find that despite maintaining household labour supply, a serious illness exerts a negative effect on household income for the poor. However, the estimates do not reject consumption smoothing. The most prominent response to finance current needs is to borrow from money lenders, which leads to an increase in household <b>debt-to-income</b> <b>ratios</b> with possible detrimental effects on future consumption...|$|R
50|$|Housing-related loans growth {{accelerated}} {{far higher}} than majority of the Euro Area during the property bubble period. As the interest rates for majority mortgage loans were variable (rather than fixed), borrowers {{were exposed to the}} risk of interest rate fluctuations and potential sharp decline in terms of property price decline. Furthermore, with the exception of Lithuania, both Estonia and Latvia imposed none cap on Loan-to-value ratio and <b>debt-to-income</b> <b>ratio.</b> Borrowers in Estonia and Latvia were also practically free from the maturity limit on their mortgage loans due to the absence of such condition by the lenders.|$|E
50|$|Lending Club enables borrowers {{to create}} loan listings {{on its website}} by {{supplying}} details about themselves and the loans {{that they would like}} to request. All loans are unsecured personal loans and can be between $1,000 - $40,000. On the basis of the borrower’s credit score, credit history, desired loan amount and the borrower’s <b>debt-to-income</b> <b>ratio,</b> Lending Club determines whether the borrower is credit worthy and assigns to its approved loans a credit grade that determines payable interest rate and fees. The standard loan period is three years; a five-year period is available at a higher interest rate and additional fees. The loans can be repaid at any time without penalty.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, {{underwriters}} {{evaluate the}} capacity to pay the loan using a comparative method known as the <b>debt-to-income</b> <b>ratio.</b> This is calculated by adding the monthly liabilities and obligations (mortgage payments, monthly credit and loan payments, child support, alimony, etc.) and dividing it by the monthly income. For an example, if a borrower has a $500 car payment, $100 in credit and loan payments, pays $500 in child support and wants a mortgage with payments $1,000 per month, her total monthly obligations is $2100. If she makes $5,000 a month, her debt to income ratio is 42%. Typically the ratio must be below anywhere from 32% for the most conservative loans to 65% for the most aggressive loans.|$|E

To do so, it studies how the 2001 and 2008 income tax rebates affected consumer bankruptcy filings. We exploit the randomized timing of the rebate checks and estimate that the rebates caused a significant, short-run increase in consumer bankruptcies in both years, with larger effects in 2008 when the rebates were more generous and more widely distributed.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that starting public school teacher salaries are too low, and student loan burdens are too high. If true, we could be facing {{a situation in which}} recent college graduates cannot afford to go into teaching because they will be unable to repay their college debts. Public policies are already being formulated on the basis of that conclusion. Unfortunately, the only major analysis of teacher salaries and student debt published to date is based largely on borrowers' subjective feelings about debt manageability. Likewise, more traditional methods of determining how much debt is too much offer little help because they are based primarily on general risks of default predicted by <b>debt-to-income</b> <b>ratios</b> rather than the ability of specific borrowers to handle their debts and other expenses. To provide legislators with a more objective basis for policymaking, this paper assesses first year teachers' ability to pay back college loans given their actual salaries and expenses. This method eliminates both the subjectivity of determining debt burdens on the basis of debtors' feelings, and the imprecision of using correlations between <b>debt-to-income</b> <b>ratios</b> and overall default rates. The findings presented here reveal that first year teachers in even the least affordable of the 16 districts examined can easily afford to pay back their debts. Indeed, with just some basic economizing, a first-year teacher could not only pay back average debt, but could handle debt levels nearly three times the national average. This does not mean that current teacher salaries or student debt burdens are "right" [...] only markets can determine that [...] but it does mean that {{there is no need for}} policymakers to intervene in either teacher pay or student aid to assure that college graduates can afford to become public school teachers...|$|R

5000|$|The Peerform Loan Analyzer is {{the unique}} {{algorithm}} {{used to determine}} if a person can qualify for a Peerform personal loan.

[...] The Peerform Loan Analyzer also uses empirical methods instead of standard filters in determining a borrower's APR rate, which the company believes will better calculate consumer credit risk.|$|E

5000|$|A highly {{controversial}} topic is the Gainful Employment Rule {{proposed by the}} Obama administration in 2010. According to the administration, {{the main purpose of}} the rule is to create career colleges and training programs that better prepare students for gainful employment. In order to determine if programs prepare students for gainful employment, the U.S. Department of Education intends to measure the relationship between the debt students incur and their incomes after completing the program as well as the rate in which program enrollees repay their loans. If a program graduates a large share of students with high <b>debt-to-income</b> <b>ratios,</b> the program may be ineligible to participate in federal student funding.

50|$|Table 1 below, {{given by}} Prosper (2005), shows data from Experian, {{one of the}} 3 main U.S. and UK credit bureaus (along with Equifax in the UK and TransUnion in the U.S. and internationally). (The data {{actually}} come from installment loans end loans, but {{can also be used}} as a fair approximation for credit card loans end loans). The table shows the loss rates from borrowers with various credit scores. To get a desired rate of return, a lender would add the desired rate to the loss rate to determine the interest rate. Though individual borrowers differ, lenders predict that, as an aggregate, borrowers will tend to exhibit the same payment behavior that others with similar credit scores have shown in the past. Banks then compete on details by making analyses of how to use data such as these along with any other data they gather from the application and history with the cardholder, to determine an interest rate that will attract borrowers by remaining competitive with other banks and still assure a profit. <b>Debt-to-income</b> <b>ratio</b> (DTI) is another important factor for determining interest rates. The bank calculates it by adding up the borrower's obligated minimum payments on loans, and dividing by the cardholder's income. If it is more than a set point (such as 20% in this example) then loans to that applicant are considered a higher risk than given by this table. These loss rates already include incomes the lenders receive from payments in collection, either from debt collection efforts after default or from selling the loans to third parties for further collection attempts, {{at a fraction of the}} amount owed.|$|E
40|$|The {{ratio of}} {{outstanding}} debt to {{gross national product}} in the United States has shown essentially no time trend over a period measured not in years but in decades. The research reported in this paper indicates that lenders' portfolio behavior exhibits characteristics that could provide aplausible explanation of this phenomenon. Given the long-run stability of the U. S. economy's wealth in relation to income, the question of lenders' behavior explaining the stable aggregate <b>debt-to-income</b> <b>ratio</b> turns on whether investors treat debt and other assets as close or distant substitutes in their portfolios. Analysis of financial assets' respective risk properties indicates that debt and equity are indeed sufficiently distant substitutes for lenders' behavior to confine the <b>debt-to-income</b> <b>ratio</b> within relatively narrow limits. In particular, the substitutability of debt and equity securitiesis sufficiently limited that very large movements in expected return differentials [...] movements so large as presumably to elicit offsetting responses from borrowers [...] {{would be required to}} induce major changes in the debt share of investors' aggregate portfolio, and hence in the economy's aggregate <b>debt-to-income</b> <b>ratio.</b> ...|$|E

Barriers to rational credit access for low incomes {{are among the}} most important obstacles faced by Lithuanian households seeking affordable dwelling. Efforts to expand access to rational housing credit have led to reforms in the lending practices of advanced industrial economies and to the creation of alternative credit institutions and instruments. For example, rational housing credit access can be expanded through the use of low interest loans, waivers of closing costs, government and private mortgage insurance, reduced down payments, sweat equity, flexible <b>debt-to-income</b> <b>ratios,</b> lease-purchase arrangements, deferred second mortgage, etc. The research was performed by studying the expertise of advanced industrial economies and by adapting it for Lithuania, taking into consideration specific history, development level, needs and traditions.
