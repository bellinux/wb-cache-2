Fiedler's first critical work appeared in 1948 and came about from his habit of reading American novels to his sons.

[...] argued a recurrent theme in American literature was an unspoken or implied homoerotic relationship between men, using Huckleberry Finn and Jim as examples. Pairs of men flee for wilderness rather than remain in the civilizing and domesticated world of women. Fiedler also deals with this male bonding in Love and Death in the American Novel [...] (1960), Waiting for the End [...] (1964) and The Return of the Vanishing American (1968).|$|E

6000|$|Blodgett College is on {{the edge}} of Minneapolis. It is a bulwark of sound religion. It is still combating the recent heresies of Voltaire, Darwin, and Robert Ingersoll. Pious {{families}} in Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, the Dakotas send their children thither, and Blodgett protects them from the wickedness of the universities. But it secretes friendly girls, young men who sing, and one lady instructress who really likes Milton and Carlyle. So the four years which Carol spent at Blodgett were not altogether wasted. The smallness of the school, the fewness of rivals, permitted her to experiment with her perilous versatility. She played tennis, gave chafing-dish parties, took a <b>graduate</b> <b>seminar</b> in the drama, went [...] "twosing," [...] and joined half a dozen societies for the practise of the arts or the tense stalking of a thing called General Culture.|$|E
