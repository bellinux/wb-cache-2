5|$|Gold {{seems to}} have been {{acquired}} from a number of sources. Gold probably came from Sasu (southern Sudan), as well as more nearby Ethiopian sources, though the latter isn't well documented for the north. A gold trade from the southern areas of Ethiopia such as the medieval province/kingdom of Innarya has been attested from the 6th century (i.e. from the writings of Cosmas Indicopleustes) and continued through James Bruce's day (18th century). Gold also came from more northerly sources such as Gojjam, Beja lands, and what is now <b>Eritrea,</b> though the latter two are less certain. However, a recent gold exploration assay in <b>Eritrea</b> has found significant gold deposits at Emba Derho, and deposits are also attested at Zara in central-western <b>Eritrea.</b>|$|E

He won his third consecutive title over the half marathon distance with ease, taking the lead early on and beating the second-placed Patrick Makau Musyoki by almost two minutes. His success caused much celebration in his home country, {{so much so that the}} President of <b>Eritrea</b> greeted him at the airport upon his return. With a strong history in the half marathon, Zersenay announced he would try the full marathon distance the following season.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Eritrea's</b> foreign {{relations}} with Ethiopia are adversarial. [...] Immediately after <b>Eritrea's</b> independence from Ethiopia, relations were cordial despite the former relationship. Since independence <b>Eritrea's</b> relationship with Ethiopia was entirely political, {{especially in the}} resuscitation and expansion of IGAD's scope. Since 1998 and the Eritrean-Ethiopian War, the relationship became increasingly hostile.|$|R

5|$|On {{his arrival}} in Cairo, Clarke began to build a network of useful contacts. He befriended Lieutenant-Colonel Raymund Maunsell, who {{operated}} Security Intelligence Middle East (SIME), the agency in charge of counter-espionage in the region. Maunsell later worked closely with Clarke, helping to feed misinformation to the enemy via double agents. Clarke's first deception was a scheme to mislead Italian forces into expecting an invasion of Italian Somaliland instead of <b>Eritrea,</b> the real Allied target. Operation Camilla fooled the Italian leadership completely but instead of diverting troops as the British hoped, they withdrew their forces into <b>Eritrea.</b> From this failure Clarke learned a first lesson, one he would teach to many other deception officers during the war: {{that the key to}} deception was not to make your enemy think what you wish but to get them to do what you want.|$|E

5|$|The British {{forces in}} Kenya under General Alan Cunningham, {{including}} Rhodesian officers and NCOs in the King's African Rifles and the Nigeria and Gold Coast Regiments, {{as well as}} the South African 1st Infantry Division, advanced into Abyssinia and Italian Somaliland during late January and February 1941, starting with the occupation of the ports of Kismayo and Mogadishu. The Italians retreated to the interior. No.237 Squadron meanwhile provided air support to the 4th and 5th Indian Divisions during Lieutenant-General William Platt's offensive into <b>Eritrea</b> from the Sudan, attacking ground targets and engaging Italian fighters. One of the Rhodesian Hardys was shot down near Keren on 7 February with the loss of both airman aboard; two days later five Italian fighters attacked a group of grounded Rhodesian aircraft at Agordat in western <b>Eritrea,</b> and wrecked two Hardys and two Lysanders.|$|E

5|$|In {{the period}} before the Second World War (1939–1945) the British wanted to reduce growth of Egyptian {{influence}} in Sudan, {{which had become}} more likely {{as a result of}} the 1936 treaty, while also suppressing the ultra-nationalist neo-Mahdist movement. They gave their support to Sayyid Ali al-Mirghani of the Khatmiyyah sect as a counterpoise to Sayyid Abd al-Rahman. Sayyid Abd al-Rahman responded by telling the British that Sayyid Ali al-Mirghani was pro-Italian due to his family commitments in <b>Eritrea,</b> but this was not accepted by the British.|$|E
