Some important phytochemicals, including curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate, genistein and resveratrol are pan-assay interference compounds, meaning that in vitro studies of their activity often provide unreliable <b>data.</b> <b>As</b> a result, phytochemicals have frequently proven unsuitable as lead compounds in drug discovery.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Titan used Jaguar's 10 PB of Lustre storage with a {{transfer}} speed of 240 GB/s, but in April 2013, the storage was upgraded to 40 PB with {{a transfer}} rate of 1.4 TB/s. GPUs {{were selected for}} their vastly higher parallel processing efficiency over CPUs. Although the GPUs have a slower clock speed than the CPUs, each GPU contains 2,688 CUDA cores at 732 MHz, resulting in a faster overall system. Consequently, the CPUs' cores are used to allocate tasks to the GPUs rather than directly processing the <b>data</b> <b>as</b> in conventional supercomputers.|$|E
5|$|No tornado watches or {{warnings}} {{were issued}} {{before the storm}} struck. This was later determined to be because of missing atmospheric sounding <b>data,</b> <b>as</b> well as an incorrect assessment of {{the height of the}} tropopause, which led to an underestimation of the strength of the thunderstorm which produced the tornado. Although a severe thunderstorm warning was issued at 2:57 pm, very few people received the warnings in time.|$|E

5|$|Often in {{part because}} of the threat of hurricanes, many coastal regions had sparse {{population}} between major ports until the advent of automobile tourism; therefore, the most severe portions of hurricanes striking the coast may have gone unmeasured in some instances. The combined effects of ship destruction and remote landfall severely limit the number of intense hurricanes in the official record before the era of hurricane reconnaissance aircraft and satellite meteorology. Although the record shows a distinct increase in the number and strength of intense hurricanes, therefore, experts regard the early <b>data</b> <b>as</b> suspect.|$|E

5|$|The concept {{underlying}} {{the method is}} based on the probability integral transform, in that a set of independent random samples derived from any random variable should on average be uniformly distributed with respect to the cumulative distribution function of the random variable.

He explicitly denied Odex access to this information.

Following the ruling, some downloaders who had already settled with Odex planned a countersuit to recover their settlement monies.

5|$|Northrop Grumman and Raytheon {{decided in}} 2002 to locate its ground station for National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, the {{successor}} of EOS, to Helsinki, Finland, instead of Svalbard.

The cable was financed by the satellite operators paying the same fee for the transmission of <b>data</b> <b>as</b> {{they would have to}} pay for a satellite connection until the cable was paid for.
