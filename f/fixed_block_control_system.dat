40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is the {{creation}} of an adaptive Function <b>Block</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> and the implementation of Artificial Intelligence integrated within the Function <b>Block</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> using IEC 61499 standard to control an ABB 6 -axis virtual robot, simulated in the software RobotStudio. To develop these objectives, we studied a lot of necessary concepts and how to use three different softwares. To learn how to use the softwares, some tests were carried out. RobotStudio is a program developed by ABB Robotics Company where an ABB robot and a station are simulated. There, we designed and created a virtual assembly cell with the virtual IRB 140 robot and the necessary pieces to simulate the <b>system.</b> To <b>control</b> the robot and the direct access to the different tools of RobotStudio, it is necessary to use an application programming interface (API) developed by ABB Robotics Company. C sharp (C#) language is used to program using the API, but this language is not supported by the Function Block programming software nxtStudio. Because of this, we used VisualStudio software. In this software, we use the API libraries to start and stop the robot and load a RAPID file in the controller. In a RAPID file the instructions that the robot must follow are written. So, we had to learn about how to program in C# language and how to use VisualStudio software. Also, to learn about IEC 61499 standard it was necessary to read some books. This standard determines how an application should be programmed through function blocks. A function block is a unit of program with a certain functionality which contains data and variables that can be manipulated in the same function block by several algorithms. To program in this standard we learnt how to use nxtStudio software, consuming a lot of time because the program is quite complex and it is not much used in the industrial world yet. Some tests were performed to learn different programing skills in this standard, such as how to use UDP communication protocol and how to program interfaces. Learning UDP communication was really useful because it is necessary for communication between nxtStudio and other programs, and also learning how to use interfaces to let the user access the program. Once we had learnt about how to use and program the different softwares and languages, we began to program the project. Then, we had some troubles with nxtStudio because strings longer than fourteen characters cannot be used here. So, a motion alarm was developed in VisualStudio program. And another important limitation of nxtStudio is that C++ language cannot be used. Therefore, the creation of an Artificial Intelligence system was not possible. So, we created a Function <b>Block</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> This system is a logistical system realised through loops, conditions and counters. All this makes the robot more adaptive. As the AI could not be carried out because of the different limitations, we theoretically designed the AI system.
