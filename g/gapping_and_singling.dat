40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{influence}} of roller mill <b>gap</b> <b>and</b> <b>single</b> kernel properties of wheat {{on the energy}} requirements of first–break grinding was studied. Multiple linear regression models for energy per unit mass (EM), new specific surface area (ANSS, in log scale), and specific energy (EA = EM /ANSS) were developed based on milling data from six wheat classes ground at five roll gaps with an experimental roller mill. The models, which were functions of roll <b>gap,</b> <b>single</b> kernel properties, <b>and</b> wheat class as a classification variable, explained most of the variability in the experimental data. Roll <b>gap</b> <b>and</b> <b>single</b> kernel hardness had the greatest influence on EM, ANSS, and EA. Milling ratio, a variable that combined <b>single</b> kernel size <b>and</b> roll <b>gap,</b> reduced some collinearities among <b>single</b> kernel properties <b>and</b> isolated the effect of single kernel mass from that of single kernel size. The effect of single kernel mass became significant in the models based on milling ratio. Good agreement between predicted and measured values was observed from 100 validation samples. The EA model is a potential alternative to break release {{as a basis for}} online roll gap control...|$|R

For an odd number of electrons in the device, the ground state {{corresponds to the}} intrinsic quasiparticle bound to the tunneling contact.

From the von Neumann entanglement entropy we determine the central charge and the transition points {{for the first two}} Mott lobes. Our DMRG results for the ground-state energy, momentum distribution function, boson correlation function decay, Mott <b>gap,</b> <b>and</b> <b>single</b> particle-spectral function are reproduced very well by the strong-coupling expansion to fifth order, and by VCA with clusters up to 12 sites as long as the ratio between the hopping amplitude and on-site repulsion, t/U, is smaller than 0. 15 and 0. 25, respectively. In addition, in the superfluid phase VCA captures well the ground-state energy and the sound velocity of the linear phonon modes. This comparison provides an authoritative estimate for the range of applicability of these methods. In strong-coupling theory for the Mott phase, the dynamical structure factor is obtained from the solution of an effective single-particle problem with an attractive potential. The resulting resonances show up as double-peak structure close to the Brillouin zone boundary. These high-energy features also appear in the superfluid phase which is characterized by a pronounced phonon mode at small momenta and energies, as predicted by Bogoliubov and field theory.

Atalla and Sgrad model together with acoustic-transmission approach (ATA) and Johnson-Allard equivalent fluid model is employed to estimate the absorption coefficient of multilayer absorber panel.

40|$|Accurate {{spectroscopy}} {{has driven}} advances in chemistry, materials science, and physics. However, despite their {{importance in the}} study of highly correlated systems, two-dimensional systems (2 DES) have proven difficult to probe spectroscopically. Typical energy scales are on the order of a millielectron volt (meV), requiring high resolution, while correlated states of interest, such as those found in the integer and fractional quantum Hall effect, are destroyed by excessive electron heating. Approaches based on tunneling have been hampered by problems such as ohmic heating and low in-plane conductivity, while optical approaches probe long-wavelength excitations which can be difficult to interpret. Here we present a refined spectroscopic technique, time domain capacitance spectroscopy (TDCS), with which we measure the single particle density of states (DOS) of a 2 DES with temperature-limited resolution. In TDCS, sharp voltage pulses disequilibrate a metallic contact from a nearby 2 DES, inducing a tunnel current. We detect this current by monitoring the image charge of the tunneled electrons on a distant electrode. No ohmic contact to the 2 DES is required. The technique works when the 2 DES is empty or has vanishing in-plane conductivity, as frequently occurs in studying the quantum Hall effect. Using TDCS, we perform unprecedentedly high resolution measurements of the DOS of a cold 2 DES in GaAs over a range from 15 meV above to 15 meV below the Fermi surface. We provide the first direct measurements of the width of the single-particle exchange <b>gap</b> <b>and</b> <b>single</b> particle lifetimes in the quantum Hall system. At higher energies, we observe the splitting of highly excited Landau levels by spin polarization at the Fermi surface, demonstrating that the high energy spectrum reflects the low temperature ground state in these highly correlated systems.

However, the two-dimensional electron system (2 DES), host to remarkable correlated electron states such as the fractional quantum Hall effect 4, has proven difficult to probe spectroscopically. Here we present an improved version of time domain capacitance spectroscopy (TDCS) 5 that now allows us to measure the SPDOS of a 2 DES with unprecedented fidelity and resolution. Using TDCS, we perform measurements of a cold 2 DES, providing the first direct measurements of the single-particle exchange-enhanced spin <b>gap</b> 6 <b>and</b> <b>single</b> particle lifetimes 7 in the quantum Hall system, as well as the first observations of exchange splitting of Landa...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere is a {{fast growing}} {{interest}} in new applications for advanced ceramic systems {{in the field of}} functional materials and in particular for optical materials. Ceramics are entitled to fulfil the <b>gap</b> between glasses <b>and</b> <b>single</b> crystals in the area of photonic materials. The processing versatility and unpaired resistance to high temperature corrosive environments of some ceramics make them good candidates for such applications. However, the critical dependence of the material optical properties on microstructure makes the deep understanding of the processing conditions even more necessary than before for the fabrication of well ordered, transparent, efficient optical ceramics. This review is directed towards ceramists interested in new applications. In the paper we address some fundamental aspects of the relationship between processing, microstructure and optical properties that are illustrated with some examples related with transparent ceramics, glass ceramics, luminescence, random lasers, thermo-emissive applications, scintillators and dielectric metamaterials...|$|R
