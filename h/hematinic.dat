40|$|Introduction Celiac disease (nontropical sprue, gluten-sensitive enteropathy, chronic {{intestinal}} malabsorption disorder) {{is caused by}} gluten intolerance. This hereditary disorder is caused by sensitivity to gliadin. Because the body's own immune system causes the damage, celiac disease {{is considered to be}} an autoimmune disorder. However, it is also classified as a disease of malabsorption because nutrients are not absorbed. When people with celiac disease eat foods containing gluten, their immune system responds by damaging the small intestine. Specifically, tiny finger-like protrusions, called villi, on the lining of the small intestine are lost. The diagnosis is suspected on the basis of symptoms and signs, enhanced by laboratory and x-ray studies, and confirmed by biopsy revealing flat mucosa and subsequent clinical and histologic improvement on a gluten-free diet. Gluten must be excluded from diet. Supplementary vitamins, minerals and <b>hematinics</b> may be given depending on deficiency. Case report This is a case report of a 23 -year old female patient with a mineralization defect (osteomalacia) and secondary osteoporosis caused by long-time unrecognized celiac disease. The patient had many symptoms: short stature, steatorrhea, anemia, weight loss and chronic bone pain. Laboratory and x-ray studies and jejunal biopsy revealed a chronic {{intestinal malabsorption}} disorder caused by gluten intolerance. Gluten-free diet and supplementary vitamins, minerals and <b>hematinics</b> were included with apparent clinical remission. Discussion and Conclusion Some people with celiac disease may not have symptoms. The undamaged part of their small intestine is able to absorb enough nutrients to prevent symptoms. However, people without symptoms are still at risk for complications of celiac disease. Biopsy of the small intestine {{is the best way to}} diagnose celiac disease. Decreased bone density (osteoporosis and osteomalacia) is a serious problem for celiacs. If calcium is not absorbed, due to small intestinal damage caused by untreated celiac disease, bones are not as dense. The only treatment for celiac disease is gluten-free diet, that is, avoiding all foods that contain gluten. For most people, this diet stops symptoms, heals the existing intestinal damage, and prevents further damage...|$|R

Objective: To determine the rate and predictors of low serum ferritin levels during the puerperium in Enugu, Southeast Nigeria. Study design: A hospital-based prospective longitudinal study involving parturient women who delivered singleton fetuses at term. Venous blood samples were collected to determine the serum ferritin concentration at 48 hours and 6 weeks postpartum. Data analysis involved descriptive and inferential statistics at 95 % confidence interval (CI) using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) computer software version 20. 0. Results: Two-hundred and two women who carried singleton pregnancies to term were studied. The mean serum ferritin levels at 48 hours and 6 weeks were 27. 82 ± 18. 41 µg/L and 36. 12 ± 21. 53 µg/L, respectively. Forty-eight hours postdelivery, 29. 2 % had low ferritin levels and this decreased to 12. 4 % at 6 weeks postpartum. There was a significant positive correlation between the serum ferritin level at 48 hours postdelivery and the serum ferritin level at 6 weeks postpartum (r= 0. 89, P< 0. 001). Predictors of the low ferritin level at 6 weeks included age < 20 years (odds ratio [OR] = 0. 70, 95 % CI = 0. 53, 0. 93), multiparity (OR = 63. 7, 95 % CI = 3. 18, 127. 5), anemia at 48 hours postpartum (OR = 61. 7, 95 % CI = 13. 27, 116. 6), a low ferritin level at 48 hours (OR = 78. 1, 95 % CI = 8. 8, 108. 3), and intake of antenatal <b>hematinics</b> for < 3 months (OR = 0. 04, 95 % CI = 0. 01, 0. 20).

40|$|Background: Children {{presenting}} {{with typical}} clinical features of celiac disease (CD) are diagnosed relatively easily, however, diagnosis remains challenging {{and is often}} delayed when they present with ′difficult to treat anemia′ without overt gastrointestinal manifestations. Index study was undertaken to report profile of patients referred to pediatric hematology unit with ′difficult anemia′ who subsequently were diagnosed with CD. Materials and Methods: The records of 83 patients (1988 - 2008) with CD were scrutinized retrospectively who had presented with predominant hematological manifestations. Results: CD was confirmed histologically in 31 (37 %), while 52 (63 %) were diagnosed by serology alone. The mean age at diagnosis was 8. 0 ± 2. 8 years. The mean duration of symptom-diagnosis interval was 40. 9 ± 30. 6 months. Eighty-one (98 %) children had anemia (Hb < 11 g/dl) and 55 (66 %) had received iron supplements without discernible benefit. Thirty-nine (47 %) patients received a blood transfusion. Thirty-six (43 %) patients did not have diarrhea. Majority of the patients had either a microcytic-hypochromic (48 %) or dimorphic (43 %) anemia. Twenty-four (33 %) had thrombocytosis, while 5 (7 %) had thrombocytopenia.

Materials and Methods: This was a questionnaire-based descriptive study of 410 antenatal clients attending primary, secondary and tertiary centers in Ibadan, Nigeria. The variables analysed were demographic data of respondents and level of health care received. Outcome measures were use of prescribed drugs, self-medication or herbal preparations. Chi-tests and logistic regression were used for statistical analysis. Results: All patients on prescribed medication for medical conditions claimed to be compliant with their drugs. Exactly 19. 2 % admitted to self-medication, mostly <b>hematinics</b> and pain-relieving pills (acetaminophen). No one admitted to alcohol or tobacco use, but 46. 3 %, especially attendees of the rural center (OR 5. 79; 95 % CI 2. 56 - 13. 10), ingested herbal concoctions while pregnant.

Nevertheless, the clinical appearance, laboratory findings and consultation did not support the diagnosis of recurrent oral Herpes Simplex infection and Behçet Syndrome, thus, enhancing the definite diagnosis of the herpetiform type of RAS with immune and <b>hematinic</b> deficiency as the underlying condition. Based on the definite diagnosis, treatment plan was then revised to target the underlying condition...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} the first clinical isolate of Bordetella petrii {{from a patient}} with mandibular osteomyelitis. The only pre-viously documented isolation of B. petrii occurred after the initial culture of a single strain from an environmental source. A 67 -year-old man visited an emergency dental clinic,where he complained of toothache in the lower right mandibular quadrant. Examination showed a root-filled lower right canine tooth that was mobile and tender to per-cussion. The tooth was extracted uneventfully under local anesthesia. The patient returned after several days with pain at the extraction site. A localized alveolar osteitis was diagnosed, and local debridement measures were institut-ed. These measures proved unsuccessful, and repeat exam-ination showed submandibular lymphadenopathy and tenderness to palpation in the buccal sulcus in the extrac-tion site. Radiographs showed no abnormality at this stage. A course of oral amoxicillin (250 mg, every 8 h for 5 days) followed by oral metronidazole (200 mg every 8 h for 5 days) was prescribed. Symptoms persisted, with increasing severity of pain in the affected area, and the patient was referred to a tertiary referral center. On exam-ination there, the patient had normal full blood count, <b>hematinics,</b> and glucose levels. Ultrasound examination of the submental soft tissue region did not indicate any abnor-mal pathology. Radiographs showed radiolucencies in the bone surrounding the extraction site. During this period a 3 -week course of oral co-amoxiclav (375 mg, every 8 h) was prescribed. A bone biopsy was performed under local anesthesia, and a diagnosis of mandibular osteomyelitis was made. A portion of the bone biopsy specimen was cultured in 10 mL Fastidious Anaerobe Broth (FAB) (BioConnections, Wetherby, UK) and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C in air. Afte...|$|R
40|$|General Objective: To {{assess the}} {{practice}} of blood conservation. Specific Objectives: To determine the methods of blood conservation in use, to assess the lower limit for hemoglobin for elective procedures, to determine transfusion trigger point in practice, to find out limitations in practice and ways to improve clinical practice. Materials and Methods: This was conducted in February 2009. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed among the surgeons and anesthetists in practice at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu State University Teaching Hospital, Ebonyi State University Teaching Hospital and National Orthopaedic Hospital, Enugu. The data gathered was analyzed using the SPSS software. Results : Of participants who agreed to fill the questionnaires, more than 50 &#x 0025; were males. The most prevalent specialty was general surgery (24. 2 &#x 0025;), followed by orthopedics (22. 6 &#x 0025;), obstetrics and gynecology (20. 7 &#x 0025;), and anesthesia (17. 7 &#x 0025;). The lowest hemoglobin limit before the patient was allowed into the theatre for elective procedures was 10 g/dl while individual transfusion trigger points ranged from hemoglobin of 6 to 10 g/dl. Majority of the doctors would avoid homologous blood transfusion {{in order to avoid}} transfusion-related diseases and reaction. Regarding knowledge of blood conservation methods and means of avoiding homologous blood, the use of diathermy was highest (12. 33 &#x 0025;), followed by preoperative blood donation (11. 87 &#x 0025;), use of <b>hematinics</b> (10. 96 &#x 0025;), and tourniquet 10. 5 &#x 0025;. Also, in practice, diathermy was the most frequently used (18. 69 &#x 0025;), followed by preoperative blood donation (16. 16 &#x 0025;), use of tourniquet (15. 15 &#x 0025;), while the Ovadje cell saver was least with 0. 01 &#x 0025;. Suggestions from respondents on the ways of limiting transfusion-related problems included optimization of patients (24. 5 &#x 0025;), improvement of standard of living (17. 7 &#x 0025;), and personnel training (13. 3 &#x 0025;). Conclusion: There is an agreement with the global trend geared toward minimizing the use of homologous blood by doctors in these hospitals. However, our practice must continually be refined by continuing medical education in order to keep everyone informed of changes in practice. The Government must improve the quality of service by the provision of unavailable infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|Recurrent aphthous {{stomatitis}} (RAS) is {{a common}} mucosal condition producing painful ulcerations in the oral cavity and considerable clinical morbidity. The etiology remains obscure, though local trauma, psychologic stress, <b>hematinic</b> deficiencies and immune dysregulation have been implicated. Though the primary goals of therapy are symptomatic relief of pain, the clinicians are aiming toward reducing the frequency, duration, number of ulcerations and increasing ulcer free periods with systemic drug therapy if topical medications appear ineffective. Levamisole, an antihelminthic drug has been tried with promising results in patients with severe RAS providing long-term benefits...|$|E
