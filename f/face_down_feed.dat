40|$|Surface topography, surface {{residual}} stress and bending strength of RBSiC ground using diamond wheel were studied. Grinding RBSiC is removed mainly by brittle fracture and lightly by ductile cutting. With {{the increase of}} <b>down</b> <b>feed,</b> surface roughness Ra increases. Burnishing with no <b>down</b> <b>feed</b> can improve the Ra in some way. With increasing <b>down</b> <b>feed,</b> the compressive {{residual stress}} decreases because of an inadequately cooling effect. Compare with the specimens grounded using 0. 9 μm/s, those using <b>down</b> <b>feed</b> of 1. 35 μm/s have worse surface quality. Considering both the processing efficiency and the surface quality, the optimum parameters are as follow: 0. 9 μm/s <b>down</b> <b>feed,</b> 2. 1 r/min work table rotational speed and 1 min burnishing...|$|R
