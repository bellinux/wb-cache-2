5|$|The 15-inch turrets {{had been}} {{designed}} when the customary practice was to place the magazine above the shell room, {{and it was not}} cost-effective to modify the ammunition <b>hoists</b> to accommodate the opposite arrangement which was adopted after the Battle of Jutland demonstrated the dangers of exposing the magazines to long-range gunfire. The ship was provided with a powder-handling room above the shell room to mimic the arrangement that turret's <b>hoists</b> were designed to handle, and another set of <b>hoists</b> moved the propellant charges from the magazines to the powder-handling room. The charges were stowed in cases to reduce their exposure to fire.|$|E

5|$|The rules {{regarding}} the correct methods {{to display the}} flag state that when two flags are fully spread out horizontally on a wall behind a podium, their <b>hoists</b> should be towards each other with the saffron stripes uppermost. If the flag is displayed on a short flagpole, this should be mounted {{at an angle to}} the wall with the flag draped tastefully from it. If two national flags are displayed on crossed staffs, the <b>hoists</b> must be towards each other and the flags must be fully spread out. The flag should never be used as a cloth to cover tables, lecterns, podiums or buildings, or be draped from railings.|$|E

40|$|Material {{transportation}} for high-rise building construction {{relies heavily on}} tower cranes. Hence {{the proper use of}} tower cranes is of paramount importance for high-rise residential building construction. In planning and monitoring crane usage in Hong Kong, a schedule is usually prepared to coordinate <b>hoisting</b> operations. Apart from that, little research in optimizing crane usage has been carried out previously, except on operation cycle times, e. g. concreting using a crane and skip and formwork erection. Allocation of time for the <b>hoisting</b> schedule is based on the planners' and operators' experience. The accuracy of the <b>hoisting</b> schedule for crane dominated construction works has significant effects on the materials supply and on concreting operations. Imbalance in the allocation of crane usage for subcontractors may lead to conflicts between trades and idling of workers due to a shortage of materials. Although planners understand that the load <b>hoisting</b> time is proportional to <b>hoisting</b> height and other factors, floor construction cycles usually, for simplicity, are assigned to be constant six day, eight day or ten day cycles without making the necessary compensation for the longer <b>hoisting</b> times for upper floors. The prediction of <b>hoisting</b> times is of great importance to planners to ensure the accuracy of the construction schedule for crane dominated construction. This paper describes the derivation of a mathematical model to predict the <b>hoisting</b> times for a tower crane for public housing construction. Work measurement is used to collect <b>hoisting</b> times data for analysis. Twelve factors considered to influence <b>hoisting</b> time are identified for the model. Multiple regression models are built for predicting supply <b>hoisting</b> times and return <b>hoisting</b> times. The effects of the variables on <b>hoisting</b> time are reviewed. Estimated <b>hoisting</b> times calculated from the models are compared with actual <b>hoisting</b> times, and a worked example illustrating the application of the models is presented.

5|$|The {{number of}} ready-use rounds is {{insufficient}} and the <b>hoists</b> are desperately slow. The 47mm guns, {{much more so}} than the large and medium-calibre guns, will have to fight at night; yet these are the only guns without a fire-control system designed for night operations. This is a deficiency which needs to be corrected as soon as possible.|$|E
5|$|The turrets {{were placed}} on pear-shaped barbettes; the first six ships had this arrangement, but the last two, Caesar and Illustrious, had {{circular}} barbettes. The BII mountings {{in the first six}} ships allowed all-around loading from the supply of ready ammunition kept in the turret, but the guns had to return to the centerline to bring ammunition up from the magazines, as the ammunition <b>hoists</b> did not rotate with the turret. Caesar and Illustrious, with their circular barbettes, had BIII mountings with rotating <b>hoists,</b> and these allowed all-around loading from the magazines. Both the BII and BIII mounts had a range of elevation from 5degrees to 13.5degrees, with the loading angle at maximum elevation. During World War I, four of the Majestics were disarmed, and these guns were used to arm eight s. A further two turrets from Illustrious were later emplaced as coastal guns on the Tyne.|$|E

5|$|A {{week after}} taking command, Moosally and his {{executive}} officer, Mike Fahey, canceled a planned $1million repair package for Iowas main gun batteries, including repairs {{to the main}} gun turrets' lighting, electrical, powder <b>hoists,</b> and hydraulic systems—75 detailed deficiencies in all. Instead, the funds were spent on overhauling the ship's powerplant. In August 1988, Iowa set sail on sea trials around the Chesapeake Bay area and then began refresher training in the waters around Florida and Puerto Rico in October.|$|E
5|$|Accommodations {{were even}} more cramped and poorly {{ventilated}} than earlier ships because the ammunition <b>hoists</b> passed through the crew spaces, a problem for ships intended for long-endurance sorties into the North Atlantic. The lack of room in the hull forced a number of workshops and offices into the superstructure which added more weight high in the ship. There were three deckhouses abaft the break in the forecastle with intervals between them to permit the beam torpedo tubes to rotate, but these were no larger than in earlier ships which meant that space was at a premium.|$|E

40|$|The dynamic {{efficiency}} of <b>hoisting</b> transmission system {{on a container}} crane is fundamental for accurate efficiency prediction, while the dynamic {{efficiency of}} <b>hoisting</b> transmission system has not been investigated sufficiently. This paper will focus on dynamic efficiency of <b>hoisting</b> transmission system under <b>hoisting</b> dynamic load. A power loss model of gearbox was built. Then the dynamic model of gear transmission was developed including time-varying mesh stiffness and <b>hoisting</b> dynamic load was studied. Power loss, dynamic efficiency, and equivalent static efficiency were conducted in <b>hoisting</b> and lowering working conditions. The result shows that dynamic efficiency which consists of the significant lower frequency component coincided with <b>hoisting</b> load torque of the higher frequency component which {{is directly related to}} dynamic mesh and bearing force. And in two processes, the equivalent static efficiency in constant speed stage is min, whereas maximum value occurs in different stage. The research results lay a foundation for <b>hoisting</b> gear transmission dynamic efficiency analysis...|$|R
5|$|The NGS deemed {{this gun}} {{obsolete}} {{shortly after the}} first ships were laid down, but the gun that it wanted to use, the Canon de 138 mm modèle 1923, was not yet available, so they planned to replace the 130mm guns later. The guns and their larger <b>hoists</b> were ordered well before any of the ships were completed {{and had to be}} written off when it became apparent that the ships' stability was too marginal to tolerate the additional top weight.|$|E
5|$|The upper {{handling}} {{room was}} {{just below the}} visible part of the mount. It was armored and reinforced to support {{the weight of the}} mount. A person standing in the upper handling room could look up and see the bottom of the gun mount inside the training circle on which the mount rotated. Hanging from the mount, and rotating with it, was the equipment used to pass ammunition up to the mount. This included the lower ends of the projectile and powder case <b>hoists.</b> In {{the center of the room}} there was a vertical tube that also turned with the mount. This tube enclosed the electrical power and control cables going up to the mount. Around the perimeter of the upper handling room were the ready service ammunition racks welded to the bulkheads. Close by, either in a corner of the handling room or in an adjoining compartment was the upper end of an ammunition hoist from the magazine. The responsibility of the men stationed in the upper handling room was to shuttle 30 to 40 projectiles and 30 to 40 powder cases per minute from the ready service racks to the <b>hoists</b> while avoiding the equipment rotating with the mount. During quiet spells, they would replenish the ready service racks with ammunition from the magazines.|$|E

30|$|The {{longitudinal}} vibrations of ropes in mine <b>hoist</b> {{have been}} widely studied by many researchers. The single-rope mine drum is the catenary–vertical rope system and the coupled lateral–longitudinal dynamic response of the cables was studied by Kaczmarczyk and Ostachowicz (2003 a, 2003 b). Qin (2007) analyzed the longitudinal vibration of <b>hoisting</b> ropes by using the Lagrange principle. Li (2010) established Horizontal and vertical vibration models of the <b>hoisting</b> container under the steel guide and the vibration characteristic of <b>hoisting</b> container under different faults of steel guide was studied. To master the impact dynamical behaviors of the <b>hoisting</b> rope during the skip loading, the mechanical model of the coupled longitudinal-torsional vibration for <b>hoisting</b> rope were built by Cao (2010).|$|R

5|$|Apart {{from the}} cordite handling, {{the battle was}} mostly inconclusive, though both the British {{flagship}} Lion and Seydlitz were severely damaged. Lion lost speed, causing her to fall behind {{the rest of the}} battleline, and Beatty was unable to effectively command his ships {{for the remainder of the}} engagement. A British signalling error allowed the German battlecruisers to withdraw, as most of Beatty's squadron mistakenly concentrated on the crippled armoured cruiser Blücher, sinking her with great loss of life. The British blamed their failure to win a decisive victory on their poor gunnery and attempted to increase their rate of fire by stockpiling unprotected cordite charges in their ammunition <b>hoists</b> and barbettes.|$|E
5|$|Two of the Mole {{sides are}} sloped whilst the {{south-east}} face is vertically walled.

The two battleships and the ancient central battery ironclad —which had {{been built in the}} mid-1870s—had been on a summer training cruise since July, and so were prepared for the conflict. On 1 October, shortly after the outbreak of war, Barbaros Hayreddin {{and the rest of the}} Ottoman fleet was moored at Beirut. The following day, the fleet departed for Constantinople for repairs in preparation to engage the Italian fleet. Nevertheless, the bulk of the Ottoman fleet, including Barbaros Hayreddin, remained in port for the duration of the war. By the end of the war, Barbaros Hayreddin and her sister were in very poor condition. Their rangefinders and the ammunition <b>hoists</b> for their main battery guns had been removed, their telephones did not work, and the pipes for their pumps were badly rusted.
