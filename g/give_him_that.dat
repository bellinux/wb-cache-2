500|$|Gaara's backstory {{became one}} of Kishimoto's {{favorite}} stories from Part I; Kishimoto had to revise his illustrations in such chapters as he wanted readers to understand more of Gaara's mental state. The character was originally {{going to be called}} Kotarou Fuuma, but Kishimoto's editor highly refused to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> name. As a result, he was given the name Gaara why he felt more suitable to the fact he always uses sand. By 2013, Kishimoto stated he still did not understand why such name was discarded. Nevertheless, he refrained from giving him of giving him a complete name like Gaara Yuzawa. Another early name was a younger child named [...] "Kumomaru" [...] but was avoided by Kishimoto. However, after multiple changes, he became Gaara. Due to his importance in the manga as a result of being Naruto's foil, Kishimoto added the kanji for [...] "love" [...] in his head to complement his name (part of Gaara's name can be read as [...] "love").|$|E
500|$|The {{central theme}} {{in almost all}} {{renditions}} of the narrative favouring the Mortara family was that of Marianna Mortara's health. From July 1858 onwards it was reported across Europe {{that as a result}} of her grief, Edgardo's mother had practically if not actually gone insane, and might even die. The powerful image of the heartbroken mother was stressed heavily in the family's appeals both to the public and to Edgardo himself. Momolo and the secretary of Rome's Jewish community, Sabatino Scazzocchio, told Edgardo that his mother's life was at risk if he did not come back soon. When Marianna wrote to her son in August, Scazzocchio refused to deliver the letter on the grounds that, being relatively calm and reassuring in tone, it might work against the impression they were trying to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> she was no longer herself and that only his return could save her. One correspondent reported in January 1859: [...] "The father shows a great deal of courage, but the mother is having a hard time carrying on.... If the Holy Father had seen this woman as I saw her, he would not have the courage to keep her son another moment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tennant {{appeared}} in Derren Brown's Trick or Treat. In TV & Satellite Week [...] (26 April – 2 May issue), Brown {{is quoted as}} saying: [...] "One of the appeals of Doctor Who for David is time travel, so I wanted to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> experience. He was open and up for it, and I got a good reaction. He's a real screamer!" [...] The episode aired on Channel 4 on 16 May 2008, and showed Tennant apparently predicting future events correctly by using automatic writing. Tennant also returned for the final episode of the series {{with the rest of}} the participants from the other episodes in the series to take part in one final experiment.|$|E

2500|$|A weaver {{who earned}} his {{livelihood}} from commercial weaving, {{as opposed to}} domestic weaving, {{had to have a}} ready supply of yarn and often it was only mill-spun yarn bought in from the mainland of Scotland could <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> supply. The great danger of using machine-spun yarn from a mainland mill was that nobody could guarantee that the yarn which came back had been made from the island wool which had been sent to the mill, or even that the yarn was made from 100% pure virgin wool as was tradition. It was by no means unheard of for unscrupulous spinning mills, particularly in the north of England, to introduce a proportion of re-cycled wool or even cotton [...] "shoddy", to make the new wool go further.|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll {{have it in}} due form. <b>Give</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> book, doctor," [...] he said. [...] "Now repeat after me, {{and then}} we'll take your testimony." ...|$|E

6000|$|... “I {{believe they}} do <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> royal title; but Dad {{is only a}} monarch in finance, and when he visits my ranch he’s as much a boy as his son.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, {{what shall}} we <b>give</b> <b>him,</b> <b>that</b> sum included?' said my aunt. 'Agnes, my dear, you and I can talk about {{division}} of it afterwards. What should it be? Five hundred pounds?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... --Even money, Lenehan said returning. I knocked against Bantam Lyons {{in there}} going to back a bloody horse someone <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> hasn't an earthly. Through here.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Sowler emptied her glass, {{and looked}} hard at Jervy across the table. [...] "My memory isn't good for much, at my time of life." [...] She <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> answer, and she <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> no more.|$|R
6000|$|The little model <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> a furtive glance. [...] "I did see him," [...] she said. [...] "I must {{go right}} away now; it wouldn't be safe, would it?" [...] Again she <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> swift look.|$|R
6000|$|... "Worthington. Worthington. He {{has begun}} making a speech before the whole room. He got up the moment old Abendgasse sat down. Why the deuce did you <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> glass of champagne?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ask for the foreman, and <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>that,</b> {{and he will}} {{arrange for}} you to begin work on Monday. Come along, Nellie; {{we have got to}} buy the fruit for to-morrow, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Suppose we don't <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> opportunity?" [...] Pierre said thoughtfully. [...] "Suppose we {{neglect to}} ask {{permission}} from any {{one to go}} out to get fish enough to prevent ourselves from starving?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Old stories, my dear Maria!" [...] cries the Countess. [...] "I am sure my dear Earl {{was very}} kind to <b>him</b> in <b>giving</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> great estate in Virginia." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because his godfathers and godmothers <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> {{name when}} he was made a child of Christ, and an inheritor {{of the kingdom of}} heaven," [...] said Lizzie, ever so pertly.|$|R

6000|$|Bah! {{the very}} thought was monstrous and impossible. Was {{the life of the}} Prince of Orange to be sacrificed because a rascal would not help her to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> word of warning which might save him even now at the {{eleventh}} hour? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think not," [...] she said. [...] "Only I blame {{myself that}} I ever trusted the Prince even {{so far as}} to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> message. For I know very well that if Victor had {{received}} it he would have been here." ...|$|E
6000|$|She sinks {{again into}} the chair, and again he withdraws. And [...] once more she <b>gives</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> soft eager look, and once more [...] averts it as he turns to her.|$|R
