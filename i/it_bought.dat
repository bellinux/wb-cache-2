5|$|After the battle, Julian was {{acclaimed}} as Augustus (co-emperor) by his troops, but he vehemently {{refused the}} title, which could only legally be bestowed {{by the ruling}} Augustus, Constantius. Given the latter's murderous attitude against potential contenders, Julian's caution is understandable, although <b>it</b> <b>bought</b> him no credit with Constantius.|$|E

Then, Braathens became a domestic airline, {{and did not}} have international scheduled services again until 1987, except during part of 1960. From 1994, the airline market was deregulated, and Braathens was free to operate domestically and within the European Economic Area. In 1997, <b>it</b> <b>bought</b> Transwede and started domestic services in Sweden, but these were terminated in 1999. The company merged with the Norwegian division of Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) in 2004 to create SAS Braathens.|$|E

5|$|Odwalla was {{incorporated}} in September 1985 {{after five years}} of growth and expanded to sell products in San Francisco in 1988. Hambrecht & Quist Inc., a venture capital firm in San Francisco, was one of Odwalla's main investors at the time, investing several million dollars in the company.

Church planned to restore it but {{his death in}} a plane crash meant that the house {{continued}} to decay until <b>it</b> was <b>bought</b> by Strand Harbour Securities and Warings of Portsmouth in 1991. A five-year, Â£4m restoration was completed in 1996 and the building became a company headquarters for a computer firm until in 2000 <b>it</b> was <b>bought</b> by the family-owned firm the Wilky Group.|$|R
5|$|Within {{five years}} Trafford Park, Europe's largest {{industrial}} estate, {{was home to}} forty firms. The earliest structures on the canal side were grain silos; the grain was used for flour and as ballast for ships carrying raw cotton. The wooden silo built opposite No.9 Dock in 1898 (destroyed in the Manchester Blitz in 1940) was Europe's largest grain elevator. The CWS bought land on Trafford Wharf in 1903, where it opened a bacon factory and a flour mill. In 1906 <b>it</b> <b>bought</b> the Sun Mill, which it extended in 1913 to create the UK's largest flour mill, with its own wharf, elevators and silos.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the decline}} in burials from an already low level, rising land values in the post war years meant that the LNC was a {{valuable}} and successful company. In the 1940s <b>it</b> <b>bought</b> {{out a number of}} other firms of funeral directors, particularly those catering for the expanding and prosperous suburbs of south west London within easy reach of Brookwood by road. The LNC continued to lobby the SR and its 1948 successor British Railways until the 1950s on the matter of cheap fares for visitors to the cemetery, but were unable to come to any agreement. In 1957 the Southern Region of British Railways considered allowing the LNC to sell discounted fares of 7s6d (compared to the standard rate of 9s4d) for return tickets for same-day travel from London to Brookwood and back. By this time most visitors to the cemetery were travelling by road. The LNC felt that the relatively minor difference between the fares would not be sufficient to attract visitors back to the railway, and the proposal was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Arcadiopolis {{was fought}} in 970 between a Byzantine army under Bardas Skleros and a Rus' army, the latter also {{including}} allied Bulgarian, Pecheneg and Hungarian (Magyar) contingents. In the preceding years, the Rus' ruler Sviatoslav had conquered Bulgaria, {{and was now}} menacing Byzantium as well. The Rus' force had been advancing through Thrace towards Constantinople when it was met by Skleros' force. Having fewer men than the Rus', Skleros prepared an ambush and attacked the Rus' army with {{a portion of his}} force. The Byzantines then feigned retreat, and succeeded in drawing off the Pecheneg contingent into the ambush, routing it. The remainder of the Rus' army then panicked and fled, and suffered heavy casualties from the pursuing Byzantines. The battle was important as <b>it</b> <b>bought</b> time for the Byzantine emperor John I Tzimiskes to settle his internal problems and assemble a large expedition, which eventually defeated Sviatoslav the next year.|$|E

5|$|The University of Alaska also grew {{during this}} period. In 1946, Congress {{appropriated}} money {{for construction of}} a Geophysical Institute to study Arctic phenomena such as the aurora borealis. The institute was established in 1949 and spurred the university's growth as the GI Bill simultaneously boosted the student population. Elementary education also developed as the Fairbanks Independent School District (the precursor to today's Fairbanks North Star Borough School District) was established in 1947 to collect school taxes from areas outside city limits that were sending students to Fairbanks' school. The Golden Valley Electric Association, an electrical cooperative, was founded in the 1940s to provide electricity to areas outside Fairbanks city limits. In 1953, <b>it</b> <b>bought</b> the FE Co. power plant that served Fairbanks and provided electricity to customers as varied as Fairbanks' second radio station, KFRB, and the town's largest farm, Creamer's Dairy.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} railroad between San Francisco and San Jose (known as the Peninsula Commute) {{was built}} by the San Francisco and San Jose Rail Road in 1863. In 1870 the railroad was acquired by Southern Pacific. Southern Pacific double tracked the line in 1904. In 1958 the railroad had record ridership, 7.5 million passengers. The popularity of the railroad began to decline and in 1977 Southern Pacific petitioned to the state government to discontinue Peninsula Commute. After months of negotiation, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) reached {{an agreement with the}} three counties of which the Peninsula Commute ran through to continue rail operation. Under the agreement, the system was renamed Caltrain and operation responsibilities were shared by Caltrans, Southern Pacific and the three counties. The Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board was formed in 1987, and <b>it</b> <b>bought</b> the right of way of Caltrain from Southern Pacific in late 1991 for $220million. The PCJPB formally took over the operation of Caltrain in 1992 and contracted Amtrak to operate the system. In the same year, Caltrain extended to Gilroy. Amtrak's contract with PCJPB was renewed in 2001.|$|E
