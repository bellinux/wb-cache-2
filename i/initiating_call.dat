40|$|Abstract. In {{existing}} component models, control {{originates in}} components, and connectors are channels for {{passing on the}} control to other components. This provides a mechanism for message passing, which allows components to invoke one another’s operations by method calls (or remote procedure calls) {{either directly or indirectly}} via a channel such as a bus. Thus components in these models mix computation with control, since in performing their computation they also <b>initiate</b> method <b>calls</b> and manage their returns, via connectors. Consequently, in terms of control, components are not loosely coupled. In this paper, we propose exogenous connectors, and demonstrate their use in a small example. In contrast to connectors in existing component models, exogenous connectors <b>initiate</b> <b>calls</b> and manage their returns, and are used to encapsulate control in a component model we are working on. In the example, we demonstrate the feasibility of exogenous connectors, and compare them with connectors in closely related architecture description languages. ...|$|R
