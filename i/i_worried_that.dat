So when she’s mistaken for his mum, it really takes her by surprise." [...] Quigan thought the storyline helped her personally and enjoyed the chemistry between her and Edwards-Brown, stating; [...] "It’s hard to deny your own personal insecurities as you get older. This storyline confronted me with the way my own body has aged, especially when I looked at myself alongside someone so much younger. <b>I</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> it would look silly, but once we were working together, I realised that it’s just two people who really get each other. Shaun is a very generous actor, who makes it really easy. He’s a delight to work with.

5000|$|It {{was very}} late when Cohen, chin stubbled and now wearing a khaki safari jacket and jeans, finally took the stage. In the liner notes to album, film {{director}} Murray Lerner confesses to Sylvie Simmons: [...] "As I watched him walk out there I thought {{this is going}} to be a disaster. Because the mood was still very mixed. There was definitely a sense of bad feeling, though there was also a sense of people being tired and not so aggressive as earlier. But Cohen was essentially acoustic, just as Kristofferson was, and I thought the crowd would be expecting a bigger high in terms of the sound of the music. <b>I</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> what happened to Kristofferson would happen to him." [...] After glaring out at the darkness and strapping on his guitar, Cohen began by telling a story about his father taking him to the circus when he was a boy. Leonard didn't much like the circus, he told them sedately, but he had enjoyed the part when a man would ask everyone in the audience to light a match. He then asked the audience to do the same so he could see where they were. Almost from the moment he began speaking, the mood of the crowd changed, and when he began singing - starting with [...] "Bird on the Wire" [...] - many of them became transfixed. Kristofferson later commented to Cohen biographer Ira Nadel in the 1996 book Various Positions: A Life of Leonard Cohen that the Canadian singer [...] "did the damndest thing you ever saw: he Charmed the Beast. A lone sorrowful voice did what some of the best rockers in the world had tried for three days and failed." ...|$|E

40|$|I {{have always}} hated Internet chat rooms and studiously avoided them. To me, they are chaotic, confusing, and frustrating. I have also {{accepted}} {{the fact that}} on this question I am probably in the minority. I suspect that most students who participate in online courses have experience with chat and are quite comfortable with the fragmented and seemingly incoherent conversations that are the hallmark of Internet chat rooms, but I am not comfortable with the chaos. As I began developing courses for online delivery, I therefore dreaded the possibility that I might have to include chat as a synchronous communication tool. However, I eventually realized that only using asynchronous discussion boards and e-mail would not adequately address the subject matter. The course I was teaching was a graduate course on theories of psychotherapy and family therapy, {{and much of the}} material was amenable to the asynchronous methods of threaded discussions and e-mails. Yet <b>I</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> the lack of spontaneous real-time interaction among course participants would fail to integrate the course material knowledge with the professional role of therapist I sought to foster in my students.

40|$|More {{years ago}} than I care to admit, I spent many not-so-unpleasant hours {{standing}} {{on a street corner}} with one eye on the controller settings and the other on traffic, trying to optimize the controller settings by making minute adjustments to initial, extension, and maximum intervals. Even when I thought the settings could be no further improved, <b>I</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> my “fine tuning ” might not yield optimum intersection performance. Something else worried me even more: Whenever I shared the street corner with another equally experienced engineer, our fine tunings were completely different. The Problem The task of evaluating intersection performance in real time is hampered by exhaust fumes that make eyes water and by horn honks that express drivers ’ opinions of the current signal timing. There is no lack of candidate performance measures: total intersection delay, approach delay, average stopped delay per vehicle, turning movement counts, and saturation flow rates are a few that come readily to mind. However, a significant gap exists between these quantitative measures and the information available to the engineer on the street corner. This gap is wide. Many engineers, despairing of ever being able to close the gap, have retired to the office and computer to generate signal settings. Others have entirely forsaken analytical techniques and have resorted to twisting knobs, pushing buttons, and keying pads in their attempt to optimize more pragmatic measures, such as horn honks per minute or cryptic driver comments per cycle. Of course, between these two extremes lie the majority of traffic engineers, who do some calculations in the office, fine tune the settings in the f~ki, and wish there were a better way. Maybe there is a better way. Technology, in the form of laptop microcomputers, has provided practicing traffic engineers with a powerful device {{that can be used to}} evaluate the effects of their knob twkting in real time...|$|E
