6000|$|That sad day of {{very small}} {{things for the}} sportsman is, however, not near, nor within {{measurable}} distance; or, so {{it seemed to me}} when, an hour ago, I strolled round the garden, curiously peering into every shrub, to find the visible and comparatively noble insect-life in great abundance. Beetles were there--hard, round, polished, and of various colours, like sea-worn pebbles on the beach; and some, called lady-birds in the vernacular, were bound like the books that Chaucer loved in black and red. And the small gilded fly, not less an insect light-headed, a votary of vain delights, than in the prehistoric days when a white-headed old king, discrowned and crazed, railed against sweet Nature's liberty. And ever waiting to welcome this inconstant lover (with falces) there sits the solitary <b>geometric</b> <b>spider,</b> an image and embodiment of patience, not on a monument, but a suspended wheel of which he is himself the hub; and so delicately fashioned are the silver spokes thereof, radiating from his round and gem-like body, and the rings, concentric tire within tire, that its exceeding fineness, like swift revolving motion, renders it almost invisible. Caterpillars, too, in great plenty--miniature porcupines with fretful quills on end, and some naked even as they came into the world. This one, called the earth-measurer, has drunk himself green with chlorophyll so as to escape detection. Vain precaution! since eccentric motion betrays him to keen avian eyes, when, like the traveller's snake, he erects himself on the tip of his tail and sways about in empty space, vaguely feeling for something, he knows not what. And the mechanical tortrix that rolls up a leaf for garment and food, and preys on his own case and shelter until he has literally eaten himself stark naked; after which he rolls up a second leaf, and so on progressively. Thus in his larval life does he symbolize some restless nation that makes itself many successive constitutions and forms of government, in none of which it abides long; but afterwards some higher thing, when he rests motionless, in form like a sarcophagus, whence the infolded life emerges to haunt the twilight--a grey ghost moth. There is no end to rolled-up leaves, and to the variety of creatures that are housed in them; for, just as the [...] "insect tribes of human kind" [...] in all places and in all ages, while seeking to improve their condition, independently hit on the same means and inventions, so it is with these small six-legged people; and many species in many places have found out the comfort and security of the green cylinder.|$|E
25|$|Latrodectus geometricus, {{commonly}} known as the brown widow, brown button spider, grey widow, brown black widow, house button <b>spider</b> or <b>geometric</b> button <b>spider,</b> is one of the widow spiders in the genus Latrodectus. As such, it is a 'cousin' to the more infamous Latrodectus mactans (black widow).|$|R
40|$|Most orb webs are {{vertically}} asymmetric {{with larger}} lower than upper parts, {{even though the}} basic structure of orb webs with concentric sticky spiral loops implies a round shape with the hub in its <b>geometric</b> centre. <b>Spiders</b> are known to modify the basic, round web structure to achieve asymmetric webs by placing the sticky spiral loops eccentrically around the hub and by inserting additional sticky spiral threads below the hub. In addition, spiders could increase asymmetry by building larger meshes below than above the hub. In the present paper, I analyzed these web modifications quantitatively in webs of Araneus diadematus Clerck 1757. In addition, I assessed the influence of gravity on the different web modifications during web building by laying some webs horizontally during auxiliary and/or sticky spiral building, and I also assessed how the web modifications influenced each other during web building. I found that web orientation during auxiliary spiral building influenced auxiliary spiral eccentricity, which in turn influenced sticky spiral eccentricity and overall web asymmetry. Web orientation during sticky spiral building only influenced – together with web asymmetry and spiral ratio – mesh size asymmetry. I conclude that A. diadematus uses the auxiliary spiral as a guiding line during sticky spiral building and that it employs different rules to build the two spirals...|$|R
