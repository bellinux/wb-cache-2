With {{the exception of}} one case-that of Rintelen reported in abstract-none is free from objection and none barring the doubtful exception of Deyl's case and the <b>inadmissible</b> <b>case</b> of Janku, refers to a case observed clinically. (1) Bock (1885). This report concerns the accidental discovery of ectasia at the posterior pole of the two eyes in a man who died, aged 32 years, from pneumonia. No clinical details were available. (2) Deyl (1898). In a boy who died, aged 5 years, there was hydrocephalus and cleft palate. Clinically there had been observed pale discs in both eyes and a central non-excavated lesion 5 D. D. wide in the left eye; in between this lesion and the disc there was a pale red area with greyish lesions containing vessels. (3) Van Duyse (1898). In this case a cyclopean eye with two lateral (macular) colobomata forms the basis of the report...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{introduce}} recursively invariant β-recursion {{theory as}} a new approach towards recursion theory on an arbitraty limit ordinal β. We follow Friedman and Sacks and call a subset of β β-recursively enumerable if it is Σ 1 -definable over Lβ. Since Friedman-Sacks' notion of a β-finite set is not invariant under β-recursive permutations of β we turn to a different notion. Under all possible invariant generalizations of finite there is a canonical one which we call i-finite. We consider further in the <b>inadmissible</b> <b>case</b> those criteria for the adequacy of generalizations of finite which have earlier been developed by Kreisel, Moschovakis and others. We look at infinitary languages over inadmissible sets Lβ and the compactness theorem for these languages, the characterization of the basic notions of β-recursion theory in terms of model theoretic invariance, the definition of β-recursion theory via an equation calculus and axioma for computation theories. In turns out that in all these approaches the i-finite sets are those subsets of β respectively Lβ which behave like finite sets. Invariant β-recursion theory contains classical recursion theory and α-recursion theory as special cases. We start {{in the second half}} of this paper the systematic development of invariant β-recursion theory for all limit ordinals β. We study in particular i-degrees, which generalize Turing degrees and α-degrees. Besides 0 (the degree of β-recursive sets) and 0 ′ (the largest β-r. e. degree) there exist incomparable β-r. e. i-degrees for every limit ordinal β. Similar as the step from ω to α gave rise to the introduction of regular respectively hyperregular sets we arrive in invariant β-recursion theory at the new notion of an i-absolute β-r. e sets. This notion is useful in order to describe a difference among hyperregular β-r. e. sets which occurs exclusively in the <b>inadmissible</b> <b>case.</b> The study of i-degrees is most difficult for those β which are strongly inadmissible (i. e. σ 1 cf β 0 such that no degree b⩽a contains a simple set and we prove a splitting theorem for simple β-r. e. sets. We base the definition of a simple set on the general notion of a 1 -finite set...|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of the assessment of ‘sufficient gravity’ {{for the purpose of}} cases and potential cases before the International Criminal Court (ICC) has been increasingly debated over the last decade. The relevant ICC case law – which this paper will examine briefly – is not explicit as to which elements are relevant for this gravity assessment. Accordingly, an analysis of this issue is of practical relevance and has some theoretical allure since the gravity assessment may lead to the decision not to open an investigation or to consider <b>inadmissible</b> a <b>case.</b> The present paper suggests that only factors that are not elements of international crimes should be taken into consideration. In order to advance this argument, this paper examines the recent proceedings on Mavi Marmara, in which there was strong disagreement between the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) and the Pre-Trial Chamber I (PTCI) in regards to the gravity of the potential cases arising from that situation...|$|R
50|$|Applications by {{individuals}} against contracting states, {{alleging that the}} state violates their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights, {{can be made by}} any person, non-governmental organisation or group of individuals. Although the official languages of the Court are English and French, applications may be submitted in any one of the official languages of the contracting states. An application has to be made in writing and signed by the applicant or by the applicant's representative. Once registered with the Court, the case is assigned to a judge rapporteur, who can make a final decision that the <b>case</b> is <b>inadmissible.</b> A <b>case</b> may be <b>inadmissible</b> when it is incompatible with the requirements of ratione materiae, ratione temporis or ratione personae, or if the case cannot be proceeded with on formal grounds, such as non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, lapse of the six months from the last internal decision complained of, anonymity, substantial identity with a matter already submitted to the Court, or with another procedure of international investigation. If the rapporteur judge decides that the case can proceed, the case is referred to a Chamber of the Court which, unless it decides that the application is <b>inadmissible,</b> communicates the <b>case</b> to the government of the state against which the application is made, asking the government to present its observations on the case. The Chamber of the Court then deliberates and judges the case on its admissibility and its merits. Cases that raise serious questions of interpretation and application of the European Convention on Human Rights, a serious issue of general importance, or which may depart from previous case law can be heard in the Grand Chamber if all parties to the case agree to the Chamber of the Court relinquishing jurisdiction to the Grand Chamber. A panel of five judges decides whether the Grand Chamber accepts the referral.|$|R
40|$|Higher {{education}} institutions (HEIs) have applied knowledge management (KM) to leverage organizational knowledge {{in support of}} their institutional achievements. HEIs need a holistic conceptualization of how KM processes dynamically interact with KM enablers and outcomes, but seem to typically lack an inclusive KM model. This research study aimed to develop and test a correlational model linking KM key enablers and processes to quality performance of HEIs. Data were collected using an online survey of 142 universities in Thailand with archival data. A key informant method was used with KM committee members serving as respondents. The 181 respondents from 60 universities voluntarily participated in the e-survey. After deleting <b>inadmissible</b> <b>cases,</b> 150 respondents were used as true response cases. The exploratory factor analysis (EFA) constructed six scales describing KM enablers and processes: Technology, Strategic Context, Culture, Leadership with a Directive Role, Knowledge Transfer, and Knowledge Generation. Then, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) with structural equation modeling (SEM) showed that the hypothesized model with seven factors (six EFA scales and quality performance score) was acceptable based on the following fit indices (?^ 2 = 1581. 515, df = 845, p <. 001; CFI =. 809; TLI =. 795; RMSEA =. 083, 90 % CI:. 077 ?. 089; SRMR =. 065). This hypothesized model adequately represented the actual data set. The thematic analyses from open ended questions provided emerging themes to support the hypothesized model that focuses on human-oriented enablers, including leadership, individual attitudes, and levels of KM understanding. This study revealed that knowledge becomes a process of individuals? insights, experiences, know-how, and values {{that are to be}} justified through social interactions among participants to make knowledge actionable and embedded in institutions? repositories and routines. Since knowledge requires dynamic management within each institution?s system, KM provides the activity of creating and sharing knowledge across the whole system. HEIs require a dedicated position for KM oversight and {{need to find a way}} to enable members to participate in social interaction processes that make knowledge flow fluently throughout their institutions. With a well-organized KM system that consists of enablers, processes, and outcomes drawn from this study, KM will keep on track and stimulate individual, group, and organizational knowledge development and retention...|$|R

40|$|The article {{explores the}} limits of the ECJ's {{exclusive}} jurisdiction by addressing two main issues: firstly, whether there are exceptions to that exclusivity, such as the application of the CILFIT case law or the exclusion of Community law from the dispute. Secondly, it asks whether other international courts must respect the ECJ's jurisdiction over a case. The article commences by briefly discussing the ECJ's exclusive jurisdiction as it was established in Opinion 1 / 91 and the Mox Plant-Case and draws conclusions from this case law. It then addresses the above-mentioned points and comes to the conclusion that there are generally no exceptions to the ECJ's exclusive jurisdiction and that the only option open to Member States is to exclude Community law from a dispute (and even that option is subject to limitations). Furthermore, after exploring several routes advanced in the academic discussion, the article comes to the conclusion that other courts must respect the ECJ's jurisdiction and as a consequence declare the <b>case</b> <b>inadmissible...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{jurisdictional}} {{relationship between}} African {{states and the}} African Court of Justice and Human and Peoples’ Rights and between the latter Court and the International Criminal Court is not entirely clear.

This chapter first discusses whether the leaving out of the term “genuinely” bears any consequences on {{the assessment of the}} quality of the performance of states in respect of investigation and prosecution of international crimes. Next, it considers two alternative scenario’s—one in which the International Criminal Court is hierarchically superior to the African Court of Justice and Human and Peoples’ Rights and one in which both courts cooperate as equal partners.

5000|$|An {{interlocutory}} {{appeal is}} a highly unusual type of appeal which can be filed before a case is concluded in the trial divisions of the Superior Court (Law or Chancery Divisions or the Family, General Equity, Probate or Foreclosure Parts). Usually, litigants can only appeal a Final Order of a Court in which one or more parties have [...] "lost" [...] and wish to have 3 (usually more experienced) judges rule on their case. Usually, interlocutory appeals are only accepted if the issue being appealed is dispositive of the entire case. A common example would be a criminal {{case in which the}} trial judge has ruled certain evidence, usually drugs, is admissible against the defendant. If the evidence is ruled to be <b>inadmissible,</b> the entire <b>case</b> would be usually be dismissed under the Exclusionary Rule. Therefore, it is efficient to have the issue decided by the appeals court before a trial, after which there may be a successful appeal to have the entire case dismissed -- wasting much time and money in the process.

50|$|Protocol 14 {{amended the}} Convention so that judges would be elected for a non-renewable term of nine years, whereas {{previously}} judges served a six-year term with {{the option of}} renewal. Amendments were also made so that a single judge could reject plainly inadmissible applications, while prior to this protocol only a three judge committee could make this final decision. In cases of doubt, the single judge refers the applications to the Committee of the Court. A single judge may not examine applications against the state which nominated him. The three judge committee has jurisdiction to declare applications admissible and decide {{on the merits of}} the case if it was clearly well founded and based on well established case law. Previously the three judge committee could only declare the <b>case</b> <b>inadmissible,</b> but could not decide on the merits of the case, which could only be done by a chambers of seven judges or the Grand Chamber.

The judge can be invited by the committee, to replace one of its members, but only for specific reasons, such as when the application relates to the exhaustion of national legal remedies.|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} many {{attempts}} to derive continuum models for dense granular flow, but a general theory is still lacking. Here, we start with Mohr-Coulomb plasticity for quasi- 2 D granular materials to calculate (average) stresses and slip planes, but we propose a "stochastic flow rule" (SFR) to replace the principle of coaxiality in classical plasticity. The SFR takes into account two crucial features of granular materials - discreteness and randomness - via diffusing "spots" of local fluidization, which act as carriers of plasticity. We postulate that spots perform random walks biased along slip-lines with a drift direction determined by the stress imbalance upon a local switch from static to dynamic friction. In the continuum limit (based on a Fokker-Planck equation for the spot concentration), this simple model is able to predict a variety of granular flow profiles in flat-bottom silos, annular Couette cells, flowing heaps, and plate-dragging experiments [...] with essentially no fitting parameters [...] although it is only expected to function where material is at incipient failure and slip-lines are <b>inadmissible.</b> For special <b>cases</b> of admissible slip-lines, such as plate dragging under a heavy load or flow down an inclined plane, we postulate a transition to rate-dependent Bagnold rheology, where flow occurs by sliding shear planes. With different yield criteria, the SFR provides a general framework for multiscale modeling of plasticity in amorphous materials, cycling between continuum limit-state stress calculations, meso-scale spot random walks, and microscopic particle relaxation...|$|R
40|$|From its inception, {{the world}} 2 ̆ 7 s first {{permanent}} International Criminal Court (2 ̆ 2 ICC 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 Court 2 ̆ 2) was envisioned {{as a body}} that would preside over only those cases of most serious concern {{to the international community}} as a whole. Thus, the Court 2 ̆ 7 s subject matter jurisdiction is limited to the international crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. Moreover, Article 17 (1) (d) of the Rome Statute provides that the Court shall determine that a <b>case</b> is <b>inadmissible</b> where the <b>case</b> is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. This so-called 2 ̆ 2 gravity threshold 2 ̆ 2 has {{played a critical role in}} guiding the Prosecutor 2 ̆ 7 s selection of both situations and cases. In addition, the first Pre-Trial Chamber to consider the question has affirmed that Article 17 (1) (d) imposes a requirement that must be met above and beyond the jurisdictional mandates of the Rome Statute. Yet, because 2 ̆ 2 gravity 2 ̆ 2 is not defined in the Statute, the appropriate scope of the term remains a matter of substantial debate. The aim of this article is therefore to review the underlying purpose of the gravity threshold as understood by the drafters of the Rome Statute, analyze the application of gravity considerations in practice during the initial years of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s operations, and offer recommendations aimed at clarifying both the objectives of the threshold and the factors relevant to its satisfaction...|$|R
5000|$|PAS {{has been}} cited {{as part of the}} child custody {{determination}} process in the United States. Based on the evaluation of PAS, courts in the US have awarded sole custody to some fathers. PAS has been challenged under the Frye test, to evaluate if it has been accepted by the scientific community. Despite Gardner claiming PAS was generally accepted by the scholarly community and passed the Frye test in two states, a 2006 analysis of court cases involving PAS and cited by Gardner concluded that these decisions did not set legal precedent, that PAS is viewed negatively in most legal scholarship, and that Gardner's writings do not support the existence of PAS. Of sixty-four precedent-bearing cases, only two decisions, both in New York State and both in criminal courts actually set precedents. Both held PAS <b>inadmissible</b> and one <b>case</b> found that PAS failed the Frye test as the appropriate professional community did not generally accept; this decision was upheld in an appellate court. Gardner listed fifty cases on his website that he claimed set precedents that made PAS admissible, but none actually did; forty-six set no precedents or did not discuss admissibility and the remaining four were problematic. One case noted that the trial court found that PAS passed the Frye test, but that finding was not reviewed on appeal so as to become precedential, as the trial court [...] "threw out the words 'parental alienation syndrome'" [...] and focused instead on the [...] "willingness and ability of each parent to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing relationship between the parents and the child" [...] under the state's child custody best interest factors. In the second case, the appellate court did not discuss PAS; the third case specifically chose not to discuss the admissibility of PAS and the fourth made no decision on PAS.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{concerns}} expressed about the implementation of complementarity under the ICC statute is whether a state will have the prerogative of deciding which crimes to charge without running {{the risk that the}} ICC will minimize the State’s choice by prosecuting the same acts under the ICC statute. The primary question is what happens if a State chooses to prosecute for an “ordinary” crime, such as murder or rape, rather than for an “international” crime, such as genocide, crimes against humanity, or war crimes? Suppose, for example, that a State is prosecuting or has prosecuted an accused for multiple murders for a particular incident that also arguably was part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population. Is the <b>case</b> <b>inadmissible</b> in the ICC or could there be a prosecution in the ICC for crimes against humanity of murder? Assuming that jurisdictional requirements are met, the issue becomes one of admissibility of the matter and, in the case of completed cases, also an issue of ne bis in idem, or double jeopardy. A case is not admissible in the ICC if a State with primary jurisdiction is willing and able to proceed with the investigation and prosecution or if the accused was already tried for the conduct and a further prosecution is now barred under the ne bis in idem provision. There are exceptions, however, to the willing and able provision and to the ne bis in idem bar if the State prosecution is a “sham” trial, shielding the accused from responsibility, or was an improper proceeding, lacking in independence or impartiality and inconsistent with bringing the accused to justice. While the issue of “ordinary” crimes occurs with both the “willing and able” standard and the ne bis in idem standard, the focus of this paper will be on the situation in which a State has already prosecuted an accused for a crime, resulting in a conviction, an acquittal, or another final determination of the case. The prior adjudication triggers the principle of ne bis in idem, or double jeopardy. I will develop the point that the design of the ne bis in idem principle in the ICC statute is highly protective of State prosecutions and is expressly different from the statutes for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) that permit greater control by the international tribunal than exists with the ICC. The definitions chosen for ne bis in idem in the ICC statute foster the priority of States in initially prosecuting crimes, give states great leeway to prosecute after an ICC prosecution, and greatly limit the ability of the ICC to prosecute after a state adjudication of the facts. Although the application of the ne bis in idem provision is not settled since the ICC has yet to interpret it, a broad interpretation of ne bis in idem that favors state prosecutions over ICC prosecutions would be more consistent with the language of the statute and the underlying principle of complementarity. This {{is not to say that}} the extensive deference to State prosecutions is necessarily the best balance between national and international prosecutions. The deferential approach will potentially preempt ICC jurisdiction in cases in which one might argue that an international prosecution based on more serious crimes would result in greater justice. Significantly for the accused, the State-protective approach of the ICC statute may result in multiple prosecutions for the same conduct. While these concerns are not inconsequential and deserve consideration from a policy and drafting perspective, this paper focuses on the interpretation that, from a legal analysis, follows from the ICC statute as it was in fact drafted. As presently constituted, the ICC ne bis in idem provisions are protective, rather than preemptive, of State prerogatives. The general principle of ne bis in idem and a detailed analysis of the ICC provisions are laid out in the following sections. Section II provides an overview of the basic terminology and concepts used with ne bis in idem, including the difference between a narrow definition that uses “crime” or “elements” and a broad definition that uses “conduct,” “acts,” or “facts. ” Section III describes the statutory provisions of the ICC statute and analyzes the meaning of the terms “crime” and “conduct” in the statute. The meaning is considered in light of the drafting history, the language differences in each paragraph of the ne bis in idem provision, the distinction between the provisions in the ICC statute and the statutes of the ICTY and the ICTR, and a comparision with the interpretation of ne bis in idem language with regard to the European arrest warrant. The conclusion is that the most accurate interpretation of the ICC statutory provisions would provide for a broad ne bis in idem prohibition when a national prosecution is followed by a potential ICC prosecution, blocking a subsequent ICC prosecution based on the same conduct. Section IV then explores whether the exceptions to ne bis in idem would have the effect of narrowing the ne bis in idem protection. Here, too, the conclusion is reached that, barring evasive, deceptive practices, it is unlikely that the exceptions would change the result that most national prosecutions would bar subsequent ICC prosecutions for the same conduct. As a conclusion, Section V is a summary of the major points why state prosecutions are given deference under the ICC ne bis in idem provisions and also a brief commentary on other unresolved issues related to ne bis in idem...|$|R
