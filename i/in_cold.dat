5|$|For potted flowers a lower {{temperature}} {{is used for}} precooling (5°C for 15 weeks), followed by 16°C–18°C in a greenhouse. For later blooming (mid- and late-forcing), bulbs are harvested in July to August and the higher temperatures are omitted, being stored a 17–20°C after harvesting and placed <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> storage at 9°C in September for 17–18 (cut flowers) or 14–16 (potted flowers) weeks. The bulbs can then be planted <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> frames, and then forced in a greenhouse according to requirements.|$|E

5|$|According to the Earps' {{version of}} events, {{the fight was}} in self-defense because the Cowboys, armed in {{violation}} of local ordinance, aggressively threatened the lawmen and defied a lawful order to hand over their weapons. The Cowboys maintained that they raised their hands, offering no resistance, and were shot <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> blood by the Earps.

5|$|Cockroaches {{are among}} the hardiest insects. Some species are capable of {{remaining}} active for a month without food {{and are able to}} survive on limited resources, such as the glue from the back of postage stamps. Some can go without air for 45 minutes. Japanese cockroach (Periplaneta japonica) nymphs, which hibernate <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> winters, survived twelve hours at −5°C to −8°C in laboratory experiments.|$|E
50|$|Recently, the {{occurrence}} of particulate Cl-PAHs has been investigated. Results have shown that most particulate Cl-PAH concentration detected in urban air tended to be high <b>in</b> <b>colder</b> seasons and low in warmer seasons. This study also determined through compositional analysis that relatively low molecular weight Cl-PAHs dominated in warmer seasons and high molecular weight Cl-PAHs dominated <b>in</b> <b>colder</b> seasons.|$|R

5|$|Drywood {{termites}} {{thrive in}} warm climates, and human activities can {{enable them to}} invade homes since they can be transported through contaminated goods, containers and ships. Colonies of termites have been seen thriving in warm buildings located <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> regions. Some termites are considered invasive species. Cryptotermes brevis, the most widely introduced invasive termite species in the world, has been introduced to all the islands in the West Indies and to Australia.|$|E

2500|$|A {{characteristic}} of the car was that <b>in</b> <b>colder</b> weather, such as at the [...] and [...] the BGP 001 struggled as it couldn't heat its tyres.

5|$|Feynman {{played an}} {{important}} role on the Presidential Rogers Commission, which investigated the Challenger disaster. During a televised hearing, Feynman demonstrated that the material used in the shuttle's O-rings became less resilient <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> weather by compressing a sample of the material in a clamp and immersing it in ice-cold water. The commission ultimately determined that the disaster was caused by the primary O-ring not properly sealing in unusually cold weather at Cape Canaveral.|$|E

5|$|Octopus blood {{contains}} the copper-rich protein haemocyanin to transport oxygen. This makes the blood very viscous {{and it requires}} considerable pressure to pump it round the body; octopuses' blood pressures can exceed 75 mmHg. <b>In</b> <b>cold</b> conditions with low oxygen levels, haemocyanin transports oxygen more efficiently than haemoglobin. The haemocyanin is dissolved in the plasma instead of being carried within blood cells, and gives the blood a bluish colour.|$|E
50|$|Although malaria is {{nowadays}} {{limited to}} tropical areas, most notoriously {{the regions of}} sub-Saharan Africa, many Anopheles species live <b>in</b> <b>colder</b> latitudes (see this map from the CDC).

50|$|This genus {{thrives in}} full sun and sandy soils, which {{explains}} their abundance in warmer climates. Mature plants can survive <b>in</b> <b>colder</b> climates down to -7 C; however, they may not bloom as profusely. Younger plants are more fragile and may not survive <b>in</b> <b>colder</b> climates when temperatures drop below freezing, so planting of younger trees in pots and moving them into a greenhouse for winter is recommended.|$|R
