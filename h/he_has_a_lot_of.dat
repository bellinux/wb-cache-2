500|$|On the {{decision}} to downplay Raziel's quest for vengeance against Kain in this sequel, Hennig explained, [...] "he's being pretty simple-minded, he's sort of being very black-and-white in his interpretation of things, and being kind of petulant [...] he's not really as heroic as Kain is, and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> stuff to figure out, basically, about what's going on". Soul Reaver 2 was crafted to feature a more cinematic, story-focused experience than its predecessor, which the developers felt had been [...] "patchy" [...] in this regard. It entered production after Blood Omen 2, but shipped almost {{six months before the}} latter game. A separate team within Crystal Dynamics, with creative autonomy, developed Blood Omen 2, and contradictions created by its scenario hindered work on Soul Reaver 2. After researching time travel fiction, Hennig devised a subplot concerning temporal paradoxes to resolve the continuity problems between both titles, and established that Blood Omen 2s story {{is a product of the}} final paradox created when Kain saves Raziel at the end of Soul Reaver 2. Other themes were inspired by the works of Joseph Campbell, and theology surrounding Gnosticism. Concepts which formulated the crux of the story included the idea [...] "that the only way a hero can ever succeed is by following his own path", and the question, [...] "can you change history or not? And if so, what does it mean to change history - in terms of being responsible for the repercussions?" ...|$|E
500|$|Espinoza {{positioned}} {{the colt}} {{in third place}} early in the race as Dortmund took the lead, followed closely by Firing Line. The three remained ahead of the pack throughout the race, and broke clear of their rivals entering the straightaway with American Pharoah making a forward move on the outside. The favorite took the lead entering the final furlong and won by a length from Firing Line and Dortmund in 2:03.02, with Frosted finishing strongly in fourth. Espinoza, who won {{the race for the}} third time, said, [...] "I feel like the luckiest Mexican on earth. He has been a special horse since the first time I rode him. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> talent and is an unbelievable horse. Turning for home I started riding a little bit harder. At the eighth pole I just couldn't put that other horse away, but he got it done." [...] Espinoza's performance attracted some scrutiny as he appeared to have struck the winner 32 times with his whip during the race. In post-race analysis, one of the stewards at Churchill Downs said, [...] "we watched [...] many, many times prior to making it official, and that wasn't anything that got our attention." [...] Baffert said, [...] "He was hitting him on the saddle towel. He doesn't hit that hard." [...] Gary Stevens, rider of second-place Firing Line, commented that he had used his whip heavily as well, stating that the race was [...] "as tough a race as I've been in in 20 years the last eighth of a mile." [...] The Blood-Horse writer Steve Haskin, while condemning whip overuse in general, offered analysis that Espinoza [...] "did a lot of waving with the whip" [...] and may not have actually hit the horse as many times as it seemed. Reflecting on the race, Baffert said that the colt did not bring his [...] "super A-game" [...] to the Derby and that {{it was the first time}} American Pharoah had really been tested by other aggressive horses.|$|E

500|$|On July 11, 2015, Marvin Carr, {{better known}} by his stage name, Capo, a {{longtime}} member of Keef's Glo Gang label, {{was shot and}} killed in a drive-by shooting in Chicago. Upon killing Capo, the drivers of the vehicle reportedly struck a stroller with 13-month-old Dillan Harris in it, killing the baby instantly. Keef later announced via Twitter that he would be holding a free benefit concert to tribute Capo, as well as encourage concertgoers to donate to Harris' family. Additionally, Keef announced the formation of the Stop the Violence Now Foundation, in an attempt to decrease crime in Chicago. Due to outstanding warrants in Illinois, Keef was scheduled to attend the concert via hologram from a sound stage in Beverly Hills. The concert, organized by HologramUSA and FilmOn Music originally intended to be held in Chicago's Redmoon Theater, faced a series of delays after Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel's office claimed Keef was [...] "an unacceptable role model" [...] and that his music promoted violence. Keef's representatives then worked out an arrangement with promoters of the Craze Fest event, located in Hammond, Indiana, in an attempt to hold the concert there. Keef's hologram was able to plea for peace in Chicago, stating, [...] "Stop the violence, stop nonsense, stop the killing. Let the kids grow up," [...] before performing [...] "I Don't Like". Fearing that the concert was a threat to public safety, Hammond mayor Thomas McDermott, Jr. successfully organized for the city's police to shut down the generators powering Keef's hologram. McDermott was quoted saying, [...] "I know nothing about Chief Keef. All I’d heard was <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> songs about gangs and shooting people — a history that’s anti-cop, pro-gang and pro-drug use. He’s been basically outlawed in Chicago, and we’re {{not going to let you}} circumvent Mayor Emanuel by going next door." [...] Chicago Tribune columnist Eric Zorn criticized Emmanuel and Hammond for their decisions, claiming they infringed upon Keef's First Amendment rights.|$|E

In 2012, Seeking Gabrielle was bred to Uncle Mo, then {{a first-year}} sire standing for $35,000. Seeking Gabrielle was {{offered for sale}} at the 2012 Keeneland Sales with Nyquist in utero, but failed to meet her reserve. Nyquist was foaled on March 10, 2013, at Coolmore's Ashford Stud in Versailles, Kentucky. His breeder, Tim Hyde Jr, summarized his prime attributes: [...] "Really good walker, really good attitude. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> presence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Commenting on the colt's success, Dettori said [...] "I {{had an easy}} lead, but Jamie [...] {{was very}} clever. He {{attacked}} early, he eyeballed me, but the horse showed what a true champion he is. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> guts and was going away at the end." [...] After the race Oppenheimer was reportedly keen to run the colt in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes but Gosden was cautious in outlining future plans saying [...] "a day at a time, {{a week at the}} time, the horse’ll tell me. I watch, I listen, that’s my job. It’s up to the horse". He did however, suggest that the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe could be a long-term target but added that the colt would not run if the ground was [...] "bottomless".|$|E

2500|$|Hagrid {{was among}} the {{characters}} that Rowling says she created on [...] "the very first day". She has explained {{the source of his}} name as [...] "another old English word, meaning – if you were hagrid – it’s a dialect word – you’d had a bad night. Hagrid is a big drinker – <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> bad nights." [...] His first name, Rubeus, was named after red in Latin to reflect alchemy and his paternal contrast to Albus Dumbledore: his [...] "passion" [...] to Dumbledore's [...] "asceticism". In her article [...] "Harry’s Fame", Rosemary Goring notes the Forest of Dean is an influence on Rowling’s work, and Hagrid is the only character that is [...] "directly drawn from the Forest of Dean". According to Goring, Hagrid’s [...] "dropped word-endings are a Chepstow speciality." [...] She also claims that Hagrid is physically [...] "modeled on the Welsh chapter of Hells Angels who’d swoop down on the town and hog the bar, 'huge mountains of leather and hair".|$|E
2500|$|Wilson is infamously {{difficult}} to interview, rarely ever giving a long answer. According to Salon writer Peter Gilstrap: [...] "He’s also {{been known to}} get up, extend a hand and blurt out 'Thanks!' well before the allotted time is up. And sometimes he just gets tired and shuts down. None of this, however, {{is due to a}} bad attitude." [...] He admits to having a poor memory, and in interviews, occasionally lies to [...] "test" [...] people. David Oppenheim, who interviewed Wilson in 1966, remembers that [...] "we tried to talk with him but didn't get much out of him. Some guy said 'He's not verbal.' He was odd and he seemed odder." [...] In 2017, the Charlotte Observers Theodon Janes surmised that while Wilson's past struggles with mental illness are widely documented, he still [...] "is faring well enough to write a book ... and to headline [...] hugely ambitious concert tour, so presumably he’s capable of telling people who work for him that he's not up for interviews, if he isn't." [...] When asked about negative comments written in the book, Love responded: [...] "He’s not in charge of his life, like I am mine. His every move is orchestrated and a lot of things he's purported to say, there’s not tape of it. But, I don’t like to put undue pressure on him, either, because I know <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> issues. Out of compassion, I don't respond to everything that is purportedly said by him." ...|$|E

60|$|So {{we talked}} for quite a little time, and I told him about Uncle trying to get work and {{how hard it was}} and how at last he had got work, or at least had gone out to get it, as a painter. Mr. Peters said that that was fine. He said that {{painters}} do well here: <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> friends who are painters and they get all the way from sixty to seventy-five cents an hour. It seems so odd to think of them being paid by the hour. I don't think the court artists at home were paid like that. It will be very nice if Uncle William can mingle with Mr. Peters's artist friends. Mr. Peters asked if he might take me out some Sunday, and I said that I would ask Uncle William and Uncle Henry and Cousin Ferdinand and Cousin Willie and if they all consented to come I would go. I hope it was not a forward thing to do.|$|E
