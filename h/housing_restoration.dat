30|$|Of the 13 {{sources of}} aid {{listed on the}} survey form, only 4 sources were {{accessed}} by 50 % {{or more of the}} respondents, implying that they were central to the <b>housing</b> <b>restoration</b> process. The four central sources of aid were family (57 %) followed by the American Red Cross (68 %), the Salvation Army (63 %), and FEMA (78 %), which was accessed by most people. Friends (47 %) and churches (44 %) were also frequently mentioned as sources of help, though less than half the respondents reported receiving aid from them. Initial analysis showed that family and friends were the main source of aid for labor and services, an essential type of aid in the debris removal and reconstruction phases of recovery, followed distantly by FEMA.|$|E
30|$|In {{regards to}} {{rebuilding}} materials, {{there were no}} significant differences between minority groups. Rebuilding materials is a type of assistance that directly relates to personal wealth accumulation. The lack of this type of assistance for minority groups strengthens the argument of institutional barriers faced by them in the recovery process, even if no direct causal relationships were evident. The fact that Anglos were receiving help for permanent <b>housing</b> <b>restoration</b> from so many sources, as compared to other minorities, was contrary to expectation and even local impressions provided by key informants. Even after controlling for variables such as damage, age, income, and so on, ethnicity was still found to be a statistically significant variable in whether a household received aid from their social network. African-Americans were still significantly less likely to receive aid from their social networks than other ethnic groups. Indeed, an Anglo household’s odds of receiving aid from the social network was nearly five times that of African-Americans, and an Hispanic household’s odds were over three times that of African-Americans.|$|E

30|$|In the end, 95 % of all flood victims {{from each}} ethnic group {{received}} {{some type of}} <b>housing</b> <b>restoration</b> aid (this includes temporary housing and replacing belongings). Less than 5 %, from each ethnic group, reported not receiving any aid, from any source. However, when supplementing the qualitative data, and local, social dynamics of the recovery process into context, one can better understand the ethnic variations in significant differences for access to permanent housing aid. Many of the ethnic differences in aid acquisition, and particularly permanent housing assistance, were obfuscated {{by a lack of}} previous research, knowledge of the complex federal system, funding complexities, and local socio-cultural challenges in housing reconstruction, which resulted in poor data categorization inhibiting a more parsed statistical analysis of the housing recovery processes. Since all ethnic groups broke with “culturally documented patterns” for their ethnicity, it shows that disasters can nullify the effect of ethnic cultural trends in the aid acquisition process. This is especially true in situations where the ethnic groups are somewhat isolated from others with the same cultural patterns, and/or there are few if any internal horizontal ties between groups (Wenger 1978).|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to analyse {{problems}} associated with the adaptability of housing to the requirements of "weak" users. Based on an analysys of the existing, the methodology defined provides a practical reference for those working in <b>housing</b> <b>restoration.</b> The integration of this projects into the surrounding area was also studied, starting from the consideration that they can only be effective if well interfaced with the wider urban-scale context. In particular, guide criteria were identified to evaluate the measures required in relation to the various types of disability and the distributive solutions and constructional techniques already existing in the home. The methodological approach developed through the use of guidelines is based on the consideration that the best solutions are those which allow the weak users to remain in their own homes, even if this necessitates the provision of home help, in order to avoid uprooting the individuals concerned and to reduce the costs to society resulting from long term hospitalisation. The work is part of a more complex panorama of housing policies being adopted by public administrations {{at a time when the}} demand for assistance has expanded greatly al all levels and the costs of satisfying it are no longer sustainable...|$|E
30|$|Recent American {{disasters}} {{have demonstrated}} {{that the loss of}} housing is one of the single greatest component of all losses in a natural disaster. Housing recovery may be the most critical element in overall family and community recovery (Bolin 1985). Of the costs associated with natural disasters recovery, over 50 % are directly related to <b>housing</b> <b>restoration,</b> but little systematic attention has been given to the processes people go through in their efforts to re-establish permanent housing (Berke and Wenger 1991; D’Souza 1982; Tootle 2007). Due to the long duration of the housing recovery processes, complexities of reconstruction, research funding, and data collection challenges, the household recovery process has not been well studied nor understood. Few studies exist that focus on the aid acquisition process low-income households’ undertake as they try to re-establish permanent housing following a natural disaster. This study follows households from the moment of impact through the housing recovery stage, 4  years after the event. The lack of studies of this sort, also, implies that the full challenges and voices of natural disaster survivors are lacking from the record (Tootle 2007). This article, in particular, focuses on whether previously documented expression of culture in disaster recovery, for the three largest ethnic groups in the USA, are substantiated in this situation; where {{the majority of the population}} is low-income and seeks to find aid to restore their homes.|$|E

30|$|There {{have been}} {{multiple}} studies centered on different variables {{that contribute to}} increasing vulnerabilities and significantly impact the disaster recovery process: ranging from gender (Anderson 1994; Drotet et al. 2015; Enarson 2012; Ganapati 2012), age (Sanders et al. 2003), language (Lindell and Perry 2004), socio-economic status (Barrios 2016; Comerio 1998; Cutter et al. 2006; Green and Olshansky 2012; Hawkins and Maurer 2009), education (Yamamura 2010), location (Brody et al. 2011; Peacock et al. 2014; Zahran et al. 2008; Zhang 2012), hazard agent (Caruson and MacManus 2008), physical limitations (Kessler et al. 2008), political structures (Binder and Greer 2016; Brody et al. 2011; Pendall 2000; Van Zandt et al. 2012), housing conditions (D’Souza 1982), and more. None of these variables act in isolation or {{can be said to}} be the primary factor determining recovery processes, albeit they do add to issues of vulnerability. Vulnerability is defined as population characteristics that generate differential and heightened challenges in anticipating, coping, and recovering from disasters (Cutter et al. 2006; Flanagan et al. 2011; Van Zandt et al. 2012). “The social aspect of vulnerability disputes the popular belief that natural disasters are indiscriminate events and instead suggests that natural disasters are socially constructed” (Peacock et al. 2014, p. 356). Notwithstanding, this, now commonly accepted, tenant (among disaster researcher and policy experts) that disasters occur due to human constructs has not influenced land-use risk much, and there has been little progress made in systematically attenuating those constructs to assist in the housing or resettlement process once a disaster hits. There is little governmental support for <b>housing</b> <b>restoration</b> (other than as a reinsurer for flood risk), so most low-income people are forced to depend on informal networks for support, whether that be financial or other.|$|E
