5|$|Commercial artist Russell H. Tandy was {{the first}} artist to {{illustrate}} Nancy Drew. Tandy was a fashion artist and infused Nancy with a contemporary fashion sensibility: her early style {{is that of a}} flatfoot flapper: heeled Mary Janes accompany <b>her</b> <b>blue</b> flapper skirt suit and cloche hat on three of the first four volume dust jackets. As styles changed over the next few years, Nancy began to appear in glamorous frocks, with immaculately set hair, pearls, matching hats, gloves, and handbags. By the 1940s, Nancy wore simpler, tailored suits and outfits; her hair was often arranged in a pompadour. In the post-war era, Tandy's Nancy is shown hatless, wearing casual skirt and blouse ensembles, and carrying a purse, like most teens of the late 1940s.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday, March 3, Maria Freitta, {{the owner}} of the dog and the playmate of Barker, went with her mother to a vacant, newly built ranch house next door to her home. It was on 433 2nd Ave, owned by her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Pat Vecchia. Maria managed to open a 3 ft × 5 ft bedroom closet's door, and her missing dog bounded out of the closet and leaped happily at her. Also in the closet was Barker, dead, in a seated position, the hood of <b>her</b> <b>blue</b> coat {{partially}} covering her blonde hair. She was found in the same clothes she had on when she disappeared. Bits of fur from her hat were rubbed off. Police Chief Edward Garrity stated he believed that Barker had recently been placed in the closet as the puppy had been fed recently, and there was no animal waste in the closet despite the dog not being housebroken.|$|E

The furs {{may be the}} {{especially}} expensive sable for him and ermine or miniver for her. He wears a hat of plaited straw dyed black, as often worn in the summer at the time. His tabard was more purple than it appears now (as the pigments have faded over time) and may be intended to be silk velvet (another very expensive item). Underneath he wears a doublet of patterned material, probably silk damask. Her dress has elaborate dagging (cloth folded and sewn together, then cut and frayed decoratively) on the sleeves, and a long train. <b>Her</b> <b>blue</b> underdress is also trimmed with white fur.|$|E

500|$|There are {{multiple}} references made to Disney's Beauty and the Beast. The chipped tea cup that Belle accidentally drops is {{a reference to}} the character Chip in the film. Also, Belle's fiancée in the show is named Gaston, the Disney antagonist, and he was turned into a red rose, which featured prominently in the film. In addition, most of Belle's clothing in the fantasy world appears to be directly inspired by clothing worn by Belle in the Disney film, such as her yellow ballgown and <b>her</b> <b>blue</b> and white plainclothes. Mr. French's flower shop is called [...] "Game of Thorns," [...] a reference to Game of Thrones, a popular fantasy show and book series. The name and a logo can be seen {{on the side of his}} van at the start of the episode. David is seen reading Anna Karenina, another story about an affair that ends tragically. In the end of the episode, a reference to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is shown, when Regina meets a nurse, who looks like nurse Ratchet and the janitor mopping up bears a striking resemblance to the Chief in the novel and film adaptation.|$|E

Around a campfire, he listens to tales; the Bouto or river dolphin used to take [...] "the shape of a beautiful woman, with hair hanging loose to her heels, and walking ashore at night in the streets of Ega, to entice the young men down to the water" [...] where the Bouto would grab them and [...] "plunge beneath the waves with a triumphant cry". They go turtle-hunting; and Bates kills an alligator with a heavy stick. He finds many footprints of the jaguar, and [...] "the great pleasure" [...] of seeing the [...] "rare and curious umbrella bird". Arrived in Catua, he admires a woman of 17: [...] "her figure was almost faultless", and <b>her</b> <b>blue</b> mouth [...] "gave quite a captivating finish to her appearance", but she was [...] "extremely bashful". He is amazed at how much alcohol the [...] "shy Indian and Mameluco maidens" [...] can drink, never giving way to their suitors without it.|$|E
500|$|Marjorie Jacqueline [...] "Marge" [...] Simpson (née Bouvier), {{voiced by}} Julie Kavner, is the well-meaning and {{extremely}} patient wife of Homer {{and mother of}} Bart, Lisa and Maggie. She often acts {{as the voice of}} reason, but displays exaggerated behavior traits of stereotypical mothers and takes the blatant dysfunctionality of her family for granted, unlike the other family members, who are aware that they are eccentric. Her most notable physical feature is <b>her</b> <b>blue</b> hair, styled into an improbably high beehive. Julie Kavner received a Primetime Emmy Award in 1992 for voicing Marge in the episode [...] "I Married Marge". For her performance in The Simpsons Movie, Kavner received a nomination for [...] "Best Voice Acting in an Animated Feature" [...] at the 2007 Annie Awards, but lost to Ian Holm in Ratatouille. Kavner's emotional performance in the movie got positive reviews and one critic said she [...] "gave what must be the most heartfelt performance ever". Part of Kavner's contract says that she will never have to promote The Simpsons on video because she does not want to [...] "destroy the illusion for children". In 2008, CityNews published an article entitled [...] "Top 10 Greatest TV Moms of All Time", and placed Marge in eighth spot.|$|E

Rihanna also performed [...] "Disturbia" [...] on her second major concert tour, Last Girl on Earth Tour. The song was performed as the sixth track, after [...] "Fire Bomb". Rihanna performed a slower ballad remix tempo of the song, surrounded by three big four-legged insect monsters as she crawled {{on the floor to}} escape while singing it. About the performance Lisa Wilton from Calgary Sun commented that: [...] "Rihanna's goth side came out – and by 'goth side' I mean she sang alongside dancers dressed as freaky, giant spiders – during the darker dancefloor anthem, 'Disturbia'." [...] On her Loud Tour, Rihanna performed [...] "Disturbia" [...] as second track, only after the opening song [...] "Only Girl (In the World)". Rihanna performed the song in a brightly colored sequined bikini, while partially been dragging on a moveable floor. Rob Williams from Winnipeg Free Press stated: [...] "Rihanna dropped <b>her</b> <b>blue</b> coat to reveal a jewel- encrusted bikini for 'Disturbia'. It was the first of numerous costume changes that showed off her fashion sense and plenty of skin." [...] Rihanna performed [...] "Disturbia" [...] at Radio 1's Hackney Weekend on May 24, 2012, as the second song on the set list.|$|E

2500|$|During her husband's {{years in}} power, the {{official}} press made Maria Antonescu {{the object of}} reverence, prompting speculation that she was vying for popularity with Queen Helen.

Another propaganda film about Romanian charities was censored {{and had to be}} redone, because officials felt that it shed too much positive light on the Red Cross, and not enough on the Blue Cross.
