5|$|Bush {{initially}} {{wanted to}} nominate Thomas to replace William Brennan, who stepped down in 1990, but he then decided that Thomas {{had not yet}} had enough experience as a judge after only months on the federal bench. Bush therefore nominated New Hampshire Supreme Court judge <b>David</b> <b>Souter</b> instead. The selection of Thomas to instead replace Marshall preserved the existing racial composition of the court.|$|E
5|$|In May 2009, President Barack Obama {{nominated}} a Catholic woman, Sonia Sotomayor, {{to replace}} retiring Justice <b>David</b> <b>Souter.</b> Her confirmation raised {{the number of}} Catholics on the Court to six, compared to three non-Catholics (all Jewish). With Antonin Scalia's death in February 2016, the number of Catholic Justices went back to five. Neil Gorsuch, appointed in 2017, was raised Catholic but attends an Episcopalian church; it is unclear if he considers himself a Catholic or a Protestant.|$|E

50|$|When nominated, Kagan was Solicitor General of the United States, {{to which}} she had been {{appointed}} by Barack Obama.

5|$|All but {{a handful}} of Supreme Court justices have been married. Frank Murphy, Benjamin Cardozo, and James McReynolds were all lifelong bachelors. In addition, retired justice <b>David</b> <b>Souter</b> and current justice Elena Kagan have never been married. William O. Douglas was the first Justice to divorce while on the Court, and also had the most marriages of any Justice, with four. Justice John Paul Stevens {{divorced}} his first wife in 1979, marrying his second wife later that year. Sonia Sotomayor was the first female justice to be appointed as an unmarried woman, having divorced in 1983, long before her nomination in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In May 2009, President Barack Obama {{nominated}} Sotomayor to the Supreme Court {{following the}} retirement of Justice <b>David</b> <b>Souter.</b> Her nomination was confirmed by the Senate in August 2009 {{by a vote of}} 68–31. Sotomayor has supported, while on the court, the informal liberal bloc of justices when they divide along the commonly perceived ideological lines. During her tenure on the Supreme Court, Sotomayor has been identified with concern for the rights of defendants, calls for reform of the criminal justice system, and making impassioned dissents on issues of race, gender and ethnic identity.|$|E
5|$|Justice <b>David</b> <b>Souter</b> wrote a dissenting opinion, {{which was}} joined by Justice Antonin Scalia. Souter {{referenced}} prior cases dealing with sovereignty and jurisdiction, from the decision made in United States v. Kagama, to the opinion made in South Dakota v. Bourland. Souter stated that the decision in this case did not align with precedent established in previous cases. Since Duro held that the tribes had lost their inherent sovereignty, {{the only way for}} the tribes to regain jurisdiction over non-member Indians would be by the delegation of that jurisdiction by Congress. Bourland was even more specific as to that point. Souter believed that the only two ways that the tribes could regain their sovereignty would be for Congress to declare that they were independent of the United States, as it did with the Philippines, or for the Court to overturn the concept of a dependent domestic sovereign.|$|E

50|$|Wood was {{considered}} a likely candidate for the United States Supreme Court in an Obama Administration. Speculation {{that she might be}} appointed intensified after Justice <b>David</b> <b>Souter's</b> retirement announcement, and Wood was the first candidate interviewed for the post by President Barack Obama, who met with her at the White House while she was visiting from Chicago. When Justice John Paul Stevens announced that he would retire at the end of October 2010 term, Wood's name was again widely put forward as a likely replacement.|$|R
25|$|Justice <b>David</b> <b>Souter</b> wrote a concurring opinion, {{using the}} {{reasoning}} that enforcement of {{a restraining order}} is a process, not the interest protected by the process, {{and that there is}} not due process protection for processes.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, {{following}} the announcement by Justice <b>David</b> <b>Souter</b> {{that he would}} retire, Garland was considered as one of nine finalists for the post, which ultimately went to Sonia Sotomayor, then a judge of the Second Circuit.|$|E

50|$|Justice <b>David</b> H. <b>Souter</b> {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the Court.

25|$|On April 16, 2008, the Supreme Court {{rejected}} Baze v. Rees, thereby upholding Kentucky's {{method of}} lethal injection in a majority 7–2 decision.

25|$|Among {{the nine}} justices, Thomas {{was the second}} most likely to uphold free speech claims (tied with <b>David</b> <b>Souter),</b> as of 2002. He has {{voted in favor of}} First Amendment claims in cases {{involving}} a wide variety of issues, including pornography, campaign contributions, political leafleting, religious speech, and commercial speech.|$|E
25|$|The four dissenting justices, {{in three}} dissents written by Justices John Paul Stevens, <b>David</b> <b>Souter,</b> and Stephen Breyer, {{took issue with}} the majority's firm line against the First Amendment ever {{applying}} to speech made {{within the scope of}} public employment, arguing instead that the government's stronger interest in this context could be accommodated by the ordinary balancing test.|$|E
50|$|Justice <b>David</b> <b>Souter's</b> dissent {{argued that}} the concept of {{sovereign}} immunity had been misapplied by the majority. Souter continued by noting that the idea of sovereign immunity was unclear during the period of the Constitution’s ratification. In addition, he argued, the Framers would certainly have not expected the idea to remain static over numerous years. In addition, Souter {{argued that the}} FLSA was national in scope and, as a result, did not violate the principle of federalism as argued by the majority. Souter also argued that the claim the FLSA was unconstitutional was spurious. Such thinking, he argued, could only be reached based upon the misguided notion of sovereign immunity and notion of federalism the majority had used in reaching its decision.|$|R
50|$|Justice Anthony M. Kennedy {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion, joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, <b>David</b> H. <b>Souter,</b> Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen G. Breyer.

50|$|Currently, {{there are}} three living retired Associate Justices: Sandra Day O'Connor, retired January 31, 2006; <b>David</b> H. <b>Souter,</b> retired June 29, 2009; and John Paul Stevens, retired June 29, 2010. Both O'Connor and Souter {{occasionally}} serve on panels of the Courts of Appeals of various circuits. Stevens has not performed any judicial duties.|$|R
25|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion which Justices John Paul Stevens, <b>David</b> <b>Souter,</b> Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer joined. The Court held that homosexuals had a protected liberty interest to engage in private, sexual activity; that homosexuals' moral and sexual choices were entitled to constitutional protection; and that moral disapproval did not provide a legitimate justification for Texas' law criminalizing sodomy.|$|E
25|$|When the Senate Ethics {{committee}} {{needed someone}} to review Republican senator Bob Packwood's diaries, the committee chose Starr. In 1990, Starr was the leading candidate for the U.S.Supreme Court nomination after William Brennan's retirement. He encountered strong resistance from the Department of Justice leadership, which feared that Starr might not be reliably conservative as a Supreme Court justice. George H. W. Bush nominated <b>David</b> <b>Souter</b> instead of Starr.|$|E
25|$|During oral argument, the Supreme Court justices {{appeared}} {{divided between}} {{the need to protect}} new technologies and the need to provide remedies against copyright infringement. Justice Antonin Scalia expressed concern that inventors would be chilled from entering the market by the threat of immediate lawsuits. Justice <b>David</b> <b>Souter</b> questioned how the interpretation of the law the plaintiffs argued for would affect devices like copy machines or the iPod.|$|E
50|$|Justice <b>David</b> H. <b>Souter</b> wrote a dissenting opinion, {{disagreeing with}} the majority's {{usage of the}} text of the Act in question. Justice Stephen Breyer also filed a dissent, writing that the silence of a Congressional statute to discuss the {{implications}} of an enhanced sentence would allow for challenges to that enhanced sentence.|$|R
50|$|Anthony Kennedy {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion, {{agreed to by}} four other justices. Two justices, Clarence Thomas and Scalia {{would have had the}} case end there with Cheney not having to disclose any information. Ruth Bader Ginsburg was joined by <b>David</b> H. <b>Souter</b> in dissenting, arguing the Supreme Court should let the case proceed in the District Court.|$|R
