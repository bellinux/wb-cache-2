5|$|<b>Hands</b> <b>Across</b> Hawthorne was a rally {{held at the}} Hawthorne Bridge in the American West Coast city of Portland, Oregon, on May 29, 2011. The {{demonstration}} was {{in response}} to an attack, one week earlier, on Brad Forkner and Christopher Rosevear, a gay male couple who had been holding hands while walking across the bridge. According to the couple and the Portland Police Bureau, a group of five men followed Forkner and Rosevear along the bridge before physically assaulting them. The assault was condemned by Portland's mayor, Sam Adams, and its police chief, Mike Reese, and news of the attack spread throughout the Pacific Northwest and the United States. The attack prompted volunteers from the Q Center, a nonprofit organization that supports the LGBT community, to form street patrols as a means of monitoring Portland's downtown area.|$|E

25|$|The first Supreme Soviet {{elections}} {{took place}} in March 1989. There was still only one legal communist party, but the availability of multi-candidate choice encouraged the popular fronts and other groups to spread their own electoral message. The Communist Party in all three Baltic republics was divided along nationalist lines, and political leaders were increasingly responding to people rather than the party. The biggest demonstration was the Baltic Way in August 1989, where people protested on the fiftieth anniversary of the Molotov–Ribbentrop treaty by a human chain linking <b>hands</b> <b>across</b> the three republics. Still, by 1990, there were not yet calls for political independence but demands for economic independence from Moscow.|$|E

25|$|Animal Boy is {{the ninth}} studio album {{released}} by the American punk band the Ramones through Sire Records on May 19, 1986. Due to conflicts within the group, the album features less of lead singer Joey Ramone, both in performing and writing, and less of lead guitarist Johnny Ramone. Bassist Dee Dee Ramone wrote and sang more on this album than previous albums, and Richie Ramone became the first drummer to write songs for the band. The album spawned four singles, all of which charted on the UK Singles Chart. In addition to singles, the band promoted their album by making a music video which parodied the benefit concerts Live Aid and <b>Hands</b> <b>Across</b> America.|$|E

500|$|Several LGBT {{and human}} rights {{organizations}} sponsored <b>Hands</b> <b>Across</b> Hawthorne {{in response to the}} attack, with the purpose of linking <b>hands</b> <b>across</b> the entire span of the Hawthorne Bridge to show solidarity. More than 4,000 people attended the rally, which had been publicized on a single Facebook page 72 hours previously. Forkner, Rosevear, Mayor Adams, and other community leaders spoke at the rally. The event received attention throughout the United States. On June 5, residents of Spokane, Washington, held a similar hand-holding rally called [...] "Hands Across Monroe", crossing the Monroe Street Bridge in Riverfront Park.|$|E
500|$|One {{year after}} the release of [...] "We Are the World", {{organizers}} noted that $44.5million had been raised for USA for Africa's humanitarian fund. They stated that they were confident that they would reach an initial set target of $50million (equivalent to $ million in [...] ). By October 1986, it was revealed that their $50million target had been met and exceeded; CBS Records gave USA for Africa a check for $2.5million, drawing the total amount of money to $51.2million. USA for Africa's <b>Hands</b> <b>Across</b> America event had also raised a significant amount of money—approximately $24.5million for the hungry in the US.|$|E
500|$|According to Cassell, <b>Hands</b> <b>Across</b> Hawthorne marked one of {{the first}} {{instances}} where Portland's major LGBT rights organizations worked together on an event other than the Portland Pride Festival. Details of the rally were reported by various publications. The Huffington Post contributor Chuck Currie, a United Church of Christ minister from Portland, used the attack and rally to question the impact of conservative evangelical religion and other anti-gay-rights organizations. Progressive Oregon and Just Out (an LGBT newspaper in Portland) noted the failure of the city's largest newspaper, The Oregonian, to cover the rally; the former sent a letter and petition to the paper's publisher N. Christian Anderson III, requesting [...] "fair and balanced" [...] coverage. Peter Bhatia, editor for The Oregonian, responded to the criticism and petition signed by more than 1,400 people by saying the paper's lack of coverage was a [...] "mistake" [...] caused by [...] "human error".|$|E

500|$|The next {{films in}} which Lombard {{appeared}} were Henry Hathaway's Now and Forever (1934), featuring Gary Cooper {{and the new}} child star Shirley Temple, and Lady by Choice (1934), which was a critical and commercial success. The Gay Bride (1934) placed her opposite Chester Morris in a gangster comedy, but this outing was panned by critics. After reuniting with George Raft for another dance picture, Rumba (1935), Lombard was {{given the opportunity to}} repeat the screwball success of Twentieth Century. In [...] Mitchell Leisen's <b>Hands</b> <b>Across</b> the Table (1935), she portrayed a manicurist in search of a rich husband, played by Fred MacMurray. Critics praised the film, and Photoplays reviewer stated that Lombard had reaffirmed her talent for the genre. It is remembered as one of her best films, and the pairing of Lombard and MacMurray proved so successful that they made three more pictures together.|$|E
500|$|On the {{macroeconomic}} level, {{the company}} was founded {{at a time of}} ascendance for the United States. [...] In 1916, the United States economic output, {{for the first time in}} history, was greater than that of the British Empire, establishing the United States as the world's largest economic superpower. [...] From World War I to the beginnings of the Great Depression, it was under these economic environmental conditions that the company originally produced a product line of harvest hats. [...] Such hats of the period were a staple of farmers and field <b>hands</b> <b>across</b> the US. [...] By the 1920s, St. Louis replaced New England as the world's dominant manufacturing center for harvest hats. [...] International Harvest Hat was a major contributor to this regional shift in industrialization. [...] By the early 1920s, the company had become the largest industrial producer of harvest hats in the world. [...] In 1928, the company produced over 36,000 per day and approximately 9.4 million harvest hats per year.|$|E
500|$|Paramount quickly began casting Lombard as {{a leading}} lady, {{primarily}} in drama films. Her profile increased when she married William Powell in 1931, but the couple divorced after two years. A turning point in Lombard's career came when she starred in Howard Hawks' pioneering screwball comedy Twentieth Century (1934). The actress found her niche in this genre, and continued to appear in films such as <b>Hands</b> <b>Across</b> the Table (1935) (forming a popular partnership with Fred MacMurray), My Man Godfrey (1936), for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress, and Nothing Sacred (1937). At this time, Lombard married [...] "the King of Hollywood", Clark Gable, and the supercouple gained much attention from the media. Keen to win an Oscar, {{at the end of}} the decade, Lombard began to move towards more serious roles. Unsuccessful in this aim, she returned to comedy in Alfred Hitchcock's Mr. & Mrs. Smith (1941) and Ernst Lubitsch's To Be or Not to Be (1942)—her final film role.|$|E

500|$|... "We Are the World" [...] gained further {{promotion}} and coverage on May 25, 1986, {{when it was}} played during a major benefit event held throughout the US. <b>Hands</b> <b>Across</b> America—USA for Africa's follow-up project—was an event in which millions of people formed a human chain across the US. The event was held {{to draw attention to}} hunger and homelessness in the United States. [...] "We Are the World"'s co-writer, Michael Jackson, had wanted his song to be the official theme for the event. The other board members of USA for Africa outvoted the singer, and it was instead decided that a new song would be created and released for the event, titled [...] "Hands Across America". When released, the new song did not achieve the level of success that [...] "We Are the World" [...] did, and the decision to use it as the official theme for the event led to Jackson—who co-owned the publishing rights to [...] "We Are the World"—resigning from {{the board of directors of}} USA for Africa.|$|E
500|$|While at the University of Florida, Youngblood was {{involved}} in the Fellowship of Christian Athletes while also speaking to youth groups and raising funds for needy children. One such event was a 57-mile bicycle ride he organized which intended to send disadvantaged youth to a summer camp. Youngblood {{was involved}} in the 1974 NFL-USO tour to Vietnam and Southeast Asia. In 1977, Youngblood was the chairman of the Los Angeles-area [...] "Right to Read" [...] program and active in the Muscular Dystrophy Foundation. The same year, he was the United Way spokesman for the Rams and was the club's Man of the Year nominee in 1975 and 1983. In 1986 He participated the <b>Hands</b> <b>Across</b> America, an event to end hunger in the United States. Other NFL stars including Walter Payton and Tony Dorsett were also in the nationwide hand-holding line. In his final 13 years (1979–1991) in Los Angeles, Youngblood sponsored a celebrity golf tournament for the John Tracy Clinic for Deaf Children, and was active with programs at the Children's Hospital for Orange County. He was named the Orange County [...] "Sportsman of the Year" [...] by the hospital in 1987.|$|E

2500|$|Although Saved From the Titanic was a {{tremendous}} success in America, Britain, and France the only known prints were destroyed in a 1914 fire at the Eclair Studios in New Jersey.

Dorothy Gibson's other accomplishments in early cinema included starring in one of the first feature films made in the United States (<b>Hands</b> <b>Across</b> the Sea, 1911), co-starring in the first American-produced serial or chapter play (The Revenge of the Silk Masks, 1912), and making one of the first-ever public appearances by a movie personality (January 1912).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Hands</b> <b>Across</b> The Border was a {{campaign}} founded {{in support of}} Scotland remaining in the United Kingdom. The campaign {{was the idea of}} Conservative politician Rory Stewart, MP for Penrith and The Border. In July 2014, the campaign initiated the construction of a large cairn on the Anglo-Scottish border at Gretna. The cairn was named 'The Auld Acquaintance', and was constructed by stones brought from across the UK and placed on the cairn by members of the public who wished to show their support for Scotland staying in the United Kingdom. The cairn was completed in September 2014, days before the referendum was held. The campaign received support from several public figures.|$|E
