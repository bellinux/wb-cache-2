500|$|He {{was born}} Napoleone di Buonaparte (...) in Corsica, to a {{relatively}} modest family from minor Italian nobility. When the Revolution broke out in 1789, Napoleon was serving as an artillery officer in the French army. Seizing the new opportunities presented by the Revolution, he rapidly rose {{through the ranks of}} the military, becoming a general at age 24. The Directory eventually gave him command of the Army of Italy after he suppressed a revolt against the government from royalist insurgents. At age 26, he began his first military campaign against the Austrians and their Italian allies—winning virtually every battle, conquering the Italian Peninsula in a year, and becoming a national hero. In 1798, he led a military expedition to Egypt that served as a springboard to political power. He engineered a coup in November 1799 and became First Consul of the Republic. His ambition and public approval inspired him to go further, and in 1804 he became the first Emperor of the French. Intractable differences with the British meant that the French were facing a Third Coalition by 1805. Napoleon shattered this coalition with decisive victories in the Ulm Campaign and a historic triumph over Russia and Austria at the Battle of Austerlitz, which led to the elimination of the thousand-year-old Holy Roman Empire. In 1806, the Fourth Coalition took up arms against him because Prussia became worried about growing French influence on the continent. Napoleon quickly defeated Prussia at the battles of Jena and Auerstedt, then marched the Grand Army deep into Eastern Europe and annihilated the Russians in June 1807 at the Battle of Friedland. France then forced the defeated nations of the Fourth Coalition to sign the Treaties of Tilsit in July 1807, bringing an uneasy peace to the continent. Tilsit signified the <b>high</b> <b>watermark</b> of the French Empire. In 1809, the Austrians and the British challenged the French again during the War of the Fifth Coalition, but Napoleon solidified his grip over Europe after triumphing at the Battle of Wagram in July.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{a robust}} {{watermarking}} algorithm using balanced multiwavelet transform is proposed. The latter transform achieves simultaneous orthogonality and symmetry without requiring any input prefiltering. Therefore, considerable reduction in computational complexity is possible, making this transform {{a good candidate}} for real-time watermarking implementations such as audio broadcast monitoring and DVD video watermarking. The embedding scheme is image adaptive using a modified version of a well-established perceptual model. Therefore, the strength of the embedded watermark is controlled according to the local properties of the host image. This has been achieved by the proposed perceptual model, which is only dependent on the image activity and is not dependent on the multifilter sets used, unlike those developed for scalar wavelets. This adaptivity is a key factor for achieving the imperceptibility requirement often encountered in watermarking applications. In addition, the watermark embedding scheme is based on the principles of spread-spectrum communications to achieve <b>higher</b> <b>watermark</b> robustness. The optimal bounds for the embedding capacity are derived using a statistical model for balanced multiwavelet coefficients of the host image. The statistical model is based on a generalized Gaussian distribution. Limits of data hiding capacity clearly show that balanced multiwavelets provide <b>higher</b> <b>watermarking</b> rates. This increase could also be exploited as a side channel for embedding watermark synchronization recovery data. Finally, the analytical expressions are contrasted with experimental results where the robustness of the proposed watermarking system is evaluated against standard watermarking attacks...|$|R

60|$|Thus {{far we have}} {{considered}} facts, which indicate, with more or less probability, the increase of the atoll in its different parts: there are others having an opposite tendency. On the south-east side, Lieutenant Sulivan, to whose kindness I am indebted for many interesting observations, found the conglomerate projecting on the reef nearly fifty yards {{in front of the}} beach: we may infer from what we see in all other parts of the atoll, that the conglomerate was not originally so much exposed, but formed the base of an islet, the front and upper part of which has since been swept away. The degree to which the conglomerate, round nearly the whole atoll, has been scooped, broken up, and the fragments cast on the beach, is certainly very surprising, even on the view that it is the office of occasional gales to pile up fragments, and of the daily tides to wear them away. On the western side, also, of the atoll, where I have described a bed of sand and fragments with trees growing out of it, in front of an old beach, it struck both Lieutenant Sulivan and myself, from {{the manner in which the}} trees were being washed down, that the surf had lately recommenced an attack on this line of coast. Appearances indicating a slight encroachment of the water on the land, are plainer within the lagoon: I noticed in several places, both on its windward and leeward shores, old cocoa-nut trees falling with their roots undermined, and the rotten stumps of others on the beach, where the inhabitants assured us the cocoa-nut could not now grow. Captain Fitzroy pointed out to me, near the settlement, the foundation posts of a shed, now washed by every tide, but which the inhabitants stated, had seven years before stood above <b>high</b> <b>watermark.</b> In the calm waters of the lagoon, directly connected with a great, and therefore stable ocean, it seems very improbable that a change in the currents, sufficiently great to cause the water to eat into the land on all sides, should have taken place within a limited period. From these considerations I inferred, that probably the atoll had lately subsided to a small amount; and this inference was strengthened by the circumstance, that in 1834, two years before our visit, the island had been shaken by a severe earthquake, and by two slighter ones during the ten previous years. If, during these subterranean disturbances, the atoll did subside, the downward movement must have been very small, as we must conclude from the fields of dead coral still lipping the surface of the lagoon, and from the breakers on the western shore not having yet regained the line of their former action. The subsidence must, also, have been preceded by a long period of rest, during which the islets extended to their present size, and the living margin of the reef grew either upwards, or as I believe outwards, to its present distance from the beach.|$|E

It made her but feel the more sharply how the specific, in almost any direction, was utterly forbidden her--how the use of it would be, for all the world, like undoing the leash of a dog eager to follow up a scent. It would come out, the specific, where the dog would come out; would run to earth, somehow, the truth--for she was believing herself in relation to the truth!--at which she mustn't so much as indirectly point.

40|$|Imperceptibility and {{robustness}} are two complementary but fundamental {{requirements of}} any watermarking algorithm. Low strength <b>watermarking</b> yields <b>high</b> imperceptibility but exhibits poor robustness. <b>High</b> strength <b>watermarking</b> schemes achieve good robustness but often infuse distortions resulting in poor visual quality in host media. If distortion due to <b>high</b> strength <b>watermarking</b> can avoid visually attentive regions, such distortions {{are unlikely to}} be noticeable to any viewer.
