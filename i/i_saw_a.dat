5|$|Constantine {{was soon}} transported to Tenedos, {{and then to}} Samothrace. He was {{ultimately}} killed while attempting to escape the island. The exact date is unknown, but since Theophanes Continuatus claims that the exiled Romanos <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> nightmare featuring his son's descent to Hell {{at the time of}} Constantine's death, it can be placed between 946 and Romanos's own death in 948.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish {{conflict}} {{flared up}} {{once again in}} 1306, when Robert the Bruce killed his rival John Comyn and declared himself the King of the Scots. Edward I mobilised a fresh army, but decided that this time his son would be formally {{in charge of the}} expedition. Prince Edward was made the Duke of Aquitaine and then, along with many other young men, he was knighted in a lavish ceremony at Westminster Abbey called the Feast of the Swans. Amid a huge feast in the neighbouring hall, reminiscent of Arthurian legends and crusading events, the assembly took a collective oath to defeat Bruce. It is unclear what role Prince Edward's forces played in the campaign that summer, which, under the orders of Edward <b>I,</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> punitive, brutal retaliation against Bruce's faction in Scotland. Edward returned to England in September, where diplomatic negotiations to finalise a date for his wedding to Isabella continued.|$|E
25|$|The buildup to World War <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> great {{demand for}} police dogs, {{which led to}} a revival of {{interest}} in the Rottweiler. During the First and Second World Wars, Rottweilers saw service in various roles, including as messenger, ambulance, draught, and guard dogs.|$|E

25|$|Edgar Leslie Bainton (14 February 18808 December 1956) was a British-born, latterly Australian-resident composer. He {{is remembered}} today mainly for his liturgical anthem And <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> new heaven, a popular {{work in the}} {{repertoire}} of Anglican church music, but during recent years Bainton's other musical works, neglected for decades, have been increasingly often heard on CD.|$|E
25|$|The {{shots were}} {{definitely}} coming my way, because when a bullet passes your head, {{it makes a}} crack. I hit the ground behind the curve, looking over. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> student hit. He stumbled and fell, {{to where he was}} running towards the car. Another student tried to pull him behind the car, bullets were coming through the windows of the car.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{home front}} during World War <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> {{systematic}} mobilization of the country's entire population and economy {{to produce the}} soldiers, food supplies, ammunitions and money necessary to win the war. Although the United States entered the war in April 1917, there had been very little planning, or even recognition {{of the problems that}} Great Britain and the other Allies had to solve on their own home fronts. As a result, the level of confusion was high in the first 12 months, before efficiency took control.|$|E

25|$|Near the {{southern}} border of Shandong one finds a kind of wheelbarrow much larger than that which I have been describing, and drawn by a horse or a mule. But judge by my surprise when today <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> whole fleet of wheelbarrows of the same size. I say, with deliberation, a fleet, {{for each of them}} had a sail, mounted on a small mast exactly fixed in a socket arranged at the forward end of the barrow. The sail, made of matting, or more often of cloth, is five or six feet high, and three or four feet broad, with stays, sheets, and halyards, just as on a Chinese ship. The sheets join the shafts of the wheelbarrow and can thus be manipulated by the man in charge.|$|E
25|$|Today I have {{experienced}} my hardest combat. But {{at the same}} time it has been my most wonderful experience of comradeship in the air. We were eight Messerschmitts in the midst of an incredible whirling mass of enemy fighters. I flew my 109 for my life. I worked with every gram of energy and by the time we finished I was foaming at the mouth and utterly exhausted. Again and again we had enemy aircraft fighters on our tails. I was forced to dive three or four times, but I pulled up again and rushed back into the turmoil. Once I seemed to have no escape; I had flown my 109 to its limits, but a Spitfire still sat behind me. At the last moment Marseille shot it down, 50 metres from my 109. I dived and pulled up. Seconds later <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> Spitfire behind Marseille. I took aim at the enemy— I have never aimed so carefully— and he dived down burning. At the end of the combat only Marseille and I were left in the dogfight. Each of us had three kills. At home we climbed out of out planes and were thoroughly exhausted. Marseille had bullet holes in his 109 and I had 11 hits in mine. We embraced each other, but were unable to speak. It was an unforgettable event.|$|E
25|$|Missionaries {{and trading}} post schools {{provided}} the first formal educational process. The first immigrants {{of the late}} 19th century and early 20th century established log house schools, or classrooms in homes and a settler with some education from the home country would offer to be the teacher. Normal school offered teacher training and were established as early as 1891 but no enrolment for that year. Until local training was completed and there were graduates, some teachers immigrated from eastern Canada and Europe to teach at the early one room school houses. Teachers from the 1880s through to 1940s taught in one room school houses which offered grades 1 through 8, and, where needed, also grades 9 through 12 with classroom sizes varying from 10 through to 40 students. Early residents could teach {{for a short time}} as permit teachers if there was a shortage of qualified teachers with a level of attainment of a Class 3 provincial certificate (also called Standard X, or Junior. World War <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> shortage of teachers as women started to work to support families, and men supported the war effort and fought in an overseas theatre of war. The 1920s and 1930s saw many students educated as teachers. Teachers are members of the Saskatchewan Teachers' Federation, an organization created in 1933. An Act Respecting the Teaching Profession of 1935 gives the group statutory recognition to support teachers and the teaching profession.|$|E
