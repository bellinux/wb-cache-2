5|$|Barbarian King Alrik– The former {{ruler of}} {{a horde of}} barbarians. As the {{champion}} of Hades, he sought the Ambrosia to save his ailing father. Alrik was ultimately unsuccessful and was killed by Kratos. Resurrected by Hades, Prince Alrik learned that he had become King {{after the death of}} his father. Alrik sought vengeance against Kratos, and his barbarian horde threatened to overwhelm Kratos' opposing Spartan army. Alrik almost killed Kratos in combat, but this was undone at the critical moment when Kratos offered up his life to Ares and was returned to battle equipped with the Blades of Chaos, which Kratos used to decapitate Alrik. Alrik eventually fought <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Underworld, and intent on revenge, found and confronted Kratos on the Island of Creation. Kratos killed the Barbarian King once again, and took his hammer. The character was voiced by Bob Joles in God of War II, and Fred Tatasciore in God of War III during the psyche sequence.|$|E

Betty tells Mulder that Lulu is causing {{all of the problems}} and forcing her to leave, while Lulu tells Scully the same thing. Later, the two look-alikes pass each other and a sewer grate blows open, sucking Mulder into the storm drain and sealing him in. Scully finds that the girls share the same father, a {{man by the name of}} Bob Damphouse, who is in prison. Damphouse is revealed to be mentally insane, and is always in a fit of rage. Eventually, Mulder finds <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm drain. At the prison, Scully meets a man that looks exactly like Bert Zupanic. Lulu and Betty meet at a stadium and everyone in the audience breaks into a fight. The other Bert Zupanic shows up and everyone stops fighting. The two Zupanics see each other and a fight breaks out again. The episode ends with Mulder and Scully shown bruised and beaten.|$|E
5|$|The portal {{takes the}} marine {{directly}} into Hell, where he proceeds to fight {{his way through}} the large number of demons to the Soul Cube, defeating its demonic guardian. The marine is then able to reinitialize the teleportation equipment left by research expeditions into Hell and return to the Delta Labs. Betruger, however, tells the marine that although the main UAC teleporter has been destroyed, Hell is opening a Hellmouth on Mars, capable of bringing millions of demons to Mars. Further in the Delta Labs, the marine encounters the injured Swann. Swann informs the marine that Kelly has been working with Hell for possibly the whole time, and has been transformed by the demons. Telling the marine that Campbell has gone after Kelly, Swann gives the marine his PDA containing information on the location on the Hellmouth under the surface of Mars and assures him that he will try to make <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> base alone.|$|E

25|$|The club's {{committee}} {{set about}} rebuilding {{the team in}} an attempt to cope with League football again. Notable signings included Joe Dorrington, a goalkeeper from Blackburn Rovers; Harold Hardman, a local schoolboy who played at outside-left but went on to bigger things at Everton and as a director at Manchester United; and Jack Parkinson, who had been the club's top scorer in their first season in the League, returned after a brief taste of First Division football with Liverpool. On <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> club was Jack Cox, who was sold to Liverpool for the large sum of £150.|$|E
25|$|Other {{setbacks}} {{followed in}} quick succession. The {{greater part of}} the Xhosa police deserted, many of them leaving with their arms. Emboldened by their initial success, a large and powerful contingent of Xhosa troops surrounded and attacked Fort Cox, where the governor was stationed with {{a small number of}} soldiers. More than one unsuccessful attempt was made to kill Sir Harry, and he began to explore ways to escape. Eventually, at the head of 150 mounted riflemen, accompanied by Colonel Mackinnon, he fought <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fort, and rode to King William’s Town through heavy Xhosa fire — a distance of 12 miles (19km).|$|E

25|$|In {{summer and}} autumn of 1799, the {{outbreak}} of the War of the Second Coalition brought renewed fighting to Schwyz. In mid-August the French General André Masséna drove the Austrian-Russian army out of the Schwyz valley. By the end of September they were fighting in the March valley. Simultaneously, the Russian General Alexander Suvorov crossed the Kinzig Pass with his army and began fighting the French in the Muota valley. Suvorov was unable to force <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canton and was eventually driven over the Pragel Pass to Glarus. The destruction and looting from both armies stripped the canton of food and ruined fields, causing hardship and death among the Schwyzer during the following winter.|$|E
25|$|On {{his way to}} exile, {{the former}} emperor {{and his family were}} escorted by former Insurgent leader Nicolás Bravo, who uncharacteristically treated Iturbide harshly. Though the republican {{movement}} had triumphed, the people still held Iturbide in high regard and greatly admired him. In <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city, his carriage was surrounded by the people, the horses dismissed and the people sought to drag the carriage themselves out of the city. This treatment was customary in the entrances or exits of great figures in or out of a city. The soldiers escorting Iturbide prevented this from happening, and would henceforth lead the former emperor through hidden roads, as the government feared a popular rising in favor of Iturbide.|$|E
25|$|The anarchic {{state in}} Mesopotamia {{weakened}} Assyria {{to such a}} degree that a number of its vassal peoples - the Babylonians, Chaldeans, Medes, Persians, Scythians and Cimmerians, attacked it in unison in 616 BC, and after a brutal struggle, sacked Nineveh and slew Sin-shar-ishkun in 612 BC. Assyrian resistance continued from 612 BC, under Ashur-uballit II, an Assyrian general who was crowned amid the house-to-house fighting in Nineveh and managed to fight <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city and form a new Assyrian capital at Harran. However, defeat by the alliance at Carchemish in 605 BC ended any realistic hopes of a resurrection of an Assyrian empire, although traces of Assyrian imperial organisation, administration and possible resistance endured in and around Dur-Katlimmu until 599 BC.|$|E

This was previously done on The Jack Paar Show and later reprised on this show April 21, 1968, and reprised on August 29, 2011, at the D23 Expo by Leslie Carrara-Rudolph (who was operating a rebuilt version of Kermit's pre-frog form) and Brian Henson (who was operating a rebuilt and redesigned version of Yorick). The act was even done on Stuffed and Unstrung (an evolved counterpart of Puppet Up!). Clooney's cover was used for that event.|$|E
25|$|Toye {{pleaded guilty}} in federal court to {{conspiracy}} to defraud collectors, to fraud in misrepresenting the painting's authenticity and origin, and to art forgery.

On September 7, 2011, William and Beryl Toye plead guilty to mail fraud charges and were sentenced to two-years probation and ordered to pay $426,393 in restitution {{to the victims of}} the fraud. Robert Lucky was also convicted of mail fraud in January 2012 and was sentenced to 25 months in prison and a restitution of $326,893. An additional three-year supervised release period and 200 hours of community service is to follow Lucky's incarceration.|$|E
25|$|The Scottish priest then {{revealed}} {{the plan for}} the British navy to evacuate the Division of the North from Denmark and land it at any location in the Spanish empire that La Romana wanted to go. After talking it over with his staff, the Spanish general told Robertson of his desire {{to go ahead with}} the operation. Soon afterward, the plan nearly miscarried when the Scot was picked up by a Danish patrol while attempting to signal a British warship off Funen. The priest managed to talk <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation and later was able to get his message to a British vessel. At length, the commander of the Baltic fleet, Admiral Richard Goodwin Keats contacted Canning that the plan could be put into motion. Transport vessels set out from England for the Baltic.|$|E

25|$|Gould's {{campaign}} was ultimately successful and Congress canceled the subsidy. Owed {{a million dollars}} by Pacific Mail, Roach was now in financial difficulty himself as nervous creditors began calling for immediate settlement of their debts. Roach bluffed <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crisis by declaring his readiness to settle any debt within three days of receiving a detailed statement. But he now had {{to decide whether to}} foreclose on Pacific Mail in order to secure at least some of his investment in the ships, or to renegotiate the payment plan. He chose the latter, accepting Pacific Mail's old ships for their scrap value as part payment, and reducing its monthly payment obligation from $75,000 to $35,000. Roach was embittered by the affair, but ironically, his handling of the crisis increased his reputation as a businessman able to deal with adverse circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Vatatzes intercepted the Seljuq army {{as it was}} {{returning}} to Turkish territory loaded with plunder from sacked Byzantine cities. He deployed his army to create a classic ambush, which was sprung when the Turks {{were in the process}} of crossing the Meander River, near the settlements of Hyelion and Leimocheir. The Seljuq army was almost helpless to defend itself and was destroyed; the Byzantine historian Niketas Choniates stated that only a few out of many thousands escaped. The Seljuq commander, who held the title 'Atabeg', was killed as he attempted to fight <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trap. The battle was a significant victory for the Byzantines and it underlined how limited the immediate effects of the Byzantine defeat at Myriokephalon were on the empire's hold over its Anatolian possessions. The Byzantine victory was followed up by punitive expeditions against the Turcoman nomads settled around the upper Meander Valley.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to Bermudes message, a Portuguese fleet {{under the command}} of Estêvão da Gama, was sent from India and arrived at Massawa in February 1541. Here he received an ambassador from the Emperor beseeching him to send help against the Muslims, and in the July following a force of 400 musketeers, {{under the command of}} Cristóvão da Gama, younger brother of the admiral, marched into the interior, and being joined by native troops were at first successful against the enemy; but they were subsequently defeated at the Battle of Wofla (28 August 1542), and their commander captured and executed. On February 21, 1543, however, Al-Ghazi was shot and killed in the Battle of Wayna Daga and his forces were totally routed. After this, quarrels arose between the Emperor and Bermudes, who had returned to Ethiopia with Gama and now urged the emperor to publicly profess his obedience to Rome. This the Emperor refused to do, and at length Bermudes was obliged to make <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country.|$|E
