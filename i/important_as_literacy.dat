The analysis focuses on the maneuverability that paperwork engenders, and thus contributes to an understanding of mobility and corporeal experiences of the state apparatus in contemporary Amazonia. New patterns of movement—travel to and from cities, daily errands, and maneuvering within social spheres—must be understood with reference to the state and its bureaucratic pervasiveness, but also as congruous with customary practices of “journeying for knowledge,” which forge an intimate link between physical and social mobility. The new maneuverability that is both prompted and necessitated by the current political setting is equally as <b>important</b> <b>as</b> <b>literacy</b> in navigating bureaucratic structures and accessing state resources...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to: (1) {{describe}} the literacy components {{based on the}} PIRLS version,   (2) identify the constructs of reading literacy competence for Grade IV of the elementary school, and (3) make {{a draft of the}} constructs of literacy competence for Grade IV of the elementary school in the Indonesian version. The data were collected through literature review, interviews, and focus group discussion. They were analyzed by the qualitative descriptive technique. The results are as follows. First, the literacy components based on the PIRLS version comprise: the reading literacy concept, assessment framework, benchmark, literary text components, and assessment system determination. Second, the reading literacy competence is constructed as the competence to read and comprehend literary and informative texts, based on four cognitive levels, from a variety of text types in line with the social context around the students and the national context. Third, the constructs of literacy competence in the Indonesian version consist of: 2 - 5 difficult words, a text length of 200 words, the composition of low to high cognitive levels of 30 - 30 - 3010, text themes suitable to Indonesian condition and culture, clear text illustrations, and tables/graphs presented in gradation.

40|$|Numeracy is as <b>important</b> <b>as</b> <b>literacy</b> and {{exhibits}} a similar frequency of disability. Although its etiology is relatively poorly understood, quantita tive genetic {{research has demonstrated}} mathematical ability to be moderately heritable. In this first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of mathematical ability and disability, 10 out of 43 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations nominated from two high- vs. low-ability (n = 600 10 -year-olds each) scans of pooled DNA were validated (P < 0. 05) in an individually genotyped sample of 2356 individuals spanning the entire distribution of mathematical ability, as assessed by teacher reports and online tests. Although the effects are of the modest sizes now expected for complex traits and require further replication, interesting candidate genes are implicated such as NRCAM which encodes a neuronal cell adhesion molecule. When combined into a set, the 10 SNPs account for 2. 9 % (F = 56. 85; df = 1 and 1881; P = 7. 277 e- 14) of the phenotypic variance. The association is linear across the distribution consistent with a quantitative trait locus (QTL) hypothesis; the third of children in our sample who harbour 10 {{or more of the}} 20 risk alleles identified are nearly twice as likely (OR = 1. 96; df = 1; P = 3. 696 e- 07) to be in the lowest performing 15 % of the distribution. Our results correspond with those of quantitative genetic research in indicating that mathematical ability and disability are influenced by many genes generating small effects across the entire spectrum of ability, implying that more highly powered studies will be needed to detect and replicate these QTL associations. © 2009 The Authors...|$|E

40|$|Throughout history {{education}} has born {{the responsibilities of}} producing qualities in our students which were essential for the times. The 21 st century now requires new qualities and skills to be developed in our future citizens. The ability to think creatively, innovatively in order to solve problems of today is a central focus for education in Australia. It is time, {{in light of the}} newly structured Australian National Education Curriculum, to re-examine and raise the prestige of Technology based subjects. This paper considers the implementation of Technology Education within the National Australian curriculum. It is suggested that the Technology curriculum has potential to evolve from a centric focus on technical skills to become the platform which can foster the "new qualities" and "skills" required of the students of the 21 st century. Fostering an appreciation for creative thinking and application to real world design issues is the first step to change the current perception of Technology Education. To raise the standing, it is apt to, again ask the question, what exactly is Technology Education? A clear definition of the technology curriculum has been identified by researchers such as Wicklein (2004) Within technology classrooms the focus needs to be directed to fostering creativity, future innovations, sustainability, future problem solving, experiential and life-long learning. There is much confusion around how students, teachers and parents perceive this subject. To persuade them of its importance, Wicklein 2004, suggests that one must use this new clearly defined structure to take forward and to shape the minds of tomorrow students. Along with the ongoing support of prominent educationalists, such as, Sir Ken Robinson, 2006, who claimed that creativity is just as <b>important</b> <b>as</b> <b>literacy</b> and numeracy, so it is anticipated that with a progressivism curriculum ideology focus and time, the prominence of this subject will rise.

40|$|The {{focus for}} {{this paper is}} the study of an Australian Government funded project titled ‘Principals as Literacy Leaders with Indigenous Communities (PALLIC) - a closing the gap’ project. Forty-eight schools with {{significant}} proportions of Indigenous children were involved. At least half were in very remote Indigenous communities in central Australia where most children were not meeting national benchmarks in literacy. The project was designed to enhance principals’ literacy leadership capabilities, but particularly so in partnership with local Indigenous people. This course of action was taken following a focussed review of scholarly writing and empirical research into leadership and literacy learning with Indigenous people (Bishop and Berryman, 2011; Priest et al, 2008; McNaughton and Lye, 2009). Taking account of the findings of Priest et al. (2008) and Frawley and Fasoli (2012), a model of leadership ‘both ways’ was proposed, bringing together a principal and at least two Indigenous Leadership Partners as a team in each of the project schools. This leadership partnership underpinned the project through the partners’ participation in a shared professional learning program. The hope was that they would work together locally, to engage teachers, parents and community members in supporting children learning to read. One year on, principals and their ILPs were surveyed to gather views about the leadership actions the project had brought into prominence. In the body of the article, we explain the research purposes on which the study was centred, the survey methods and items used. Two survey instruments were administered, one online with principals, the other ‘face-to-face’ in print form with principals and ILPs. A discussion of the results highlights the growth of partnership relationships between principals and their ILPs and the difficulties in extending the benefits of their collaborative work beyond the school. The findings are used to problematize the efficacy of a ‘both ways’ model of leadership and to put forward issues for the further study of school leadership with local Indigenous people. The overall conclusion reached suggests that on matters as <b>important</b> <b>as</b> <b>literacy</b> learning which is so subject to home and community influences, leadership approaches need to be turned ‘inside-out’ – that is, action on literacy considered important by parents and community members must be brought to bear on literacy leadership within the school – circumstances not yet the case...|$|E

40|$|My {{contention}} is that creativity now is <b>as</b> <b>important</b> in education <b>as</b> <b>literacy,</b> {{and we should}} treat it with the same status. (Robinson, 2006) This bold assertion from Sir Ken Robinson, a leading expert and speaker on creativity, is perhaps even truer {{now than it was}} six years ago. Literacy (and numeracy) have always been, and should remain, fundamental to education. However, creativity is not a rival to literacy or numeracy education; it is not an addition to these (or any other) areas of the curriculum. Creativity should be a core, integrated element of teaching and learning throughout the curriculum and the school environment. In the new national curriculum, “critical and creative thinking” are highlighted as general capabilities “that can be developed and applied across the curriculum” (ACARA, 2011, p. 15). Moreover, an aim of education noted by the 2008 Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for Young Australians is “to support all young Australians to become [...] . confident and creative individuals” (MCEETYA, 2008, p. 8). These are confirmation that creativity should have high “status” in Australian education. ...|$|R

40|$|Computer {{literacy}} {{is the ability}} to use computers as tools. Computers affect peoples’ lives. Hodge and Miller (1997 : [Online]) describe the impact of computers in people’s lives and indicate that “information and communication technologies are rapidly changing the way individuals live, firms do business, governments administer and nations interact. ” Mangena, the Deputy Minister of Education, claims that, “today, basic computer literacy skills are becoming just <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> acquiring <b>literacy</b> and numeracy skills” (DoE, 2003 : [Online]). Increasingly, teachers are also expected to use ICT for their teaching, administration and also in the classroom. In the South African situation, many teachers are ill-prepared to use computers, as they have no experience or training in this regard. However, several training programmes exist that train teachers for Educational ICT. The ultimate aim is that teachers will transfer the skills acquired at such training programmes for teaching and learning in their own contexts. Hence, {{the purpose of this study}} was to explore the ways in which teachers transfer the skills that they learnt at a computer course to their work environment. The main findings from data indicated that a number of factors and conditions influence the transfer of skills. Primarily, the course presenter’s style, course content, support from management and peers, time for practice, learning in context, students’ confidence, nature and scope of assessment, accessibility to resources and conditions under which students transfer skills, have great influence in the transfer of learning.

This study examined the joint and unique predictive significance of em rgent literacy skills for both later emergent literacy skills and reading in two samples of preschoolers. Ninety-six children (mean age = 41 months, SD = 9. 41) were followed from early to late preschool, and 97 children (mean age = 60 months, SD = 5. 41) were followed from late preschool to kindergarten or first grade. Structural equation modeling revealed significant developmental continuity of these skills, particularly for letter knowledge and phonological sensitivity from late preschool to early grade school, both of whic were the only unique predictors of decoding.

The next (and largest) section of the booklet considers various metaphors of literacy. A table detailing some ways of talking about literacy is presented. It lists the following topics: six conditions (sickness and/or handicap, ignorance, incapacity, oppression, deprivation, deviance); ways and means of responding to them; {{the goals of the}} possible responses/interventions; and situations where the interventions may be applied. Also included in the section on metaphors of literacy are discussions of the following topics: <b>literacy</b> <b>as</b> control; <b>literacy</b> <b>as</b> a "crisis"; <b>literacy</b> <b>as</b> autonomy and the importance of helping learners master basic skills; <b>literacy</b> <b>as</b> a right and a means of promoting social justice; literacy for social action and the concept of transformation; <b>literacy</b> <b>as</b> technology; and <b>literacy</b> <b>as</b> social practice.
