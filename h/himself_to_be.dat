5|$|After {{allowing}} <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used by {{the casting}} director, Harry gets a small role as a cop in the film {{for which he had}} previously been rejected. On-set he impresses the producers and they offer him a part in a TV series.|$|E

5|$|Clara {{volunteers to}} speak to Skaldak to try and calm him, {{relaying}} the Doctor's words to Skaldak, though {{he knows that the}} Doctor is listening. The Doctor informs Skaldak he was encased in the ice for 5000 years. Skaldak laments the loss of his daughter and his people; however, the Doctor tries to comfort him with the knowledge that the Ice Warriors still live, just not on Earth or Mars. Skaldak escapes from his armour - an act of great dishonour - and stops broadcasting the signal to the other Ice Warriors because he believes <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the only one of his kind left. The Doctor surmises that, thinking <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the last of his kind, Skaldak has nothing left to lose. He manages to grab and kill three members of the crew.|$|E
5|$|Doctor Stephen Strange: The Queen's Physician, {{who is also}} {{a magician}} and alchemist.

Believing <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> next, Alex withdraws from the group.|$|E
5|$|Also like Bewick, many {{articles}} {{end with}} a tail-piece, a small engraving, but here again Yarrell shows <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> both more serious and less merely decorative than Bewick, with more information to impart. The Egyptian vulture article ends with a large and accurate engraving of another specimen, so the article shows both a young and an old bird, with clearly different plumage which is also described in the text.|$|E
5|$|At the Miles family home, Billy, now highly suspicious, {{enters and}} pulls his {{gun on the}} man {{who appears to be}} his father.

If Cole is Infamous, he allows Empire City to slip further into chaos, and disregards Kessler's warning about the Beast, believing <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the strongest to ever exist.|$|E

Burton continued to represent Rialto before the Postmaster, and draw his monthly salary, for five months. Burton's intervention was successful, and the Postmaster's investigation was ceased without the entry of a fraud order.|$|E
5|$|Chopin {{arrived in}} Paris in late September 1831; {{he would never}} return to Poland, thus {{becoming}} one of many expatriates of the Polish Great Emigration. In France he used the French versions of his given names, and after receiving French citizenship in 1835, he travelled on a French passport. However, Chopin remained close to his fellow Poles in exile as friends and confidants and he never felt fully comfortable speaking French. Chopin's biographer Adam Zamoyski writes that he never considered <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> French, despite his father's French origins, and always saw himself as a Pole.|$|E
