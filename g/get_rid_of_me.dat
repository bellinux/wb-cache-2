500|$|On May 18, 2007, the San Francisco Chronicle {{reported}} that Oakland general manager Billy Beane was considering adding Henderson to the roster for one game in September, provided {{it did not}} [...] "infringe on {{the integrity of the}} roster or of the season", so that Henderson could retire as an Oakland A's player. A month later, Henderson appeared to reject the overture, saying, [...] "One day? I don't want one day. I want to play again, man. I don't want nobody's spot... I just want to see if I deserve to be out there. If I don't, just <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> release me. And if I belong, you don't have to pay me but the minimum — and I'll donate every penny of that to some charity. So, how's that hurtin' anybody?... Don't say goodbye for me... When I want that one day they want to give me so bad, I'll let you know." [...] The Athletics retired Henderson's #24 on August 1, 2009.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{their many}} {{disagreements}} Brooke and Churchill held an affection for each other. After one fierce clash Churchill told {{his chief of}} staff and military adviser, Sir Hastings Ismay, that he did not think he could continue to work any longer with Brooke because [...] "he hates me. I can see hatred looking from his eyes." [...] Brooke responded to Ismay: “Hate him? I don't hate him. I love him. But the first time I tell him that I agree with him when I don't will be the time to <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> for then I can be no more use to him." [...] When Churchill was told this he murmured, ”Dear Brookie.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{structure}} of the poem forms an interesting and logical argument and progression. [...] In the first stanza he is saying you're too good for me, so I understand {{if you want to}} <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> [...] In the second stanza he is saying that I am nowhere close to good enough for you, but maybe you are not aware of it. [...] And in the third stanza he is saying you are too good for me, but maybe you didn't realize that before. [...] In the closing couplet, Shakespeare confesses that no matter what the cause of misjudgment, you're released by the mistake, and [...] "I'm left here to remember our time together" [...] when I felt like nobility.|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll {{let that}} subject drop. I must {{remind you that}} your father's will and the {{partnership}} deed prevent your <b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> unless I'm willing to go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is a lie!" [...] he exclaimed, {{struggling}} in his rage {{to break through}} the strong habit of self-control. [...] "It is a damnable lie; but it is the most cruel way <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> and therefore the one most congenial to your heartlessness." ...|$|R
6000|$|The light that, {{under my}} last assurances, had so {{considerably}} revived faded in {{her a little}} as she saw me again tackle the theme of her inconstancy; but the prospect <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> on these terms made my inquiry, none the less, worth trying to face. [...] "That moment?" [...] She showed the effort to think back.|$|R
2500|$|Bow won {{an evening}} gown {{and a silver}} trophy, and the {{publisher}} committed to help her [...] "gain a role in films", but nothing happened. Bow's father told her to [...] "haunt" [...] Brewster's office (located in Brooklyn) until {{they came up with}} something. [...] "To <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> or maybe they really meant to (give me) all the time and were just busy", Bow was introduced to director Christy Cabanne, who cast her in Beyond the Rainbow, produced late 1921 in New York City and released February 19, 1922. Bow did five scenes and impressed Cabanne with true theatrical tears, but was cut from the final print. [...] "I was sick to my stomach," [...] she recalled and thought her mother was right about the movie business.|$|E
2500|$|In 1970 Clyde Packer became joint {{managing}} director of Nine Network with his father, Frank. Clyde later recalled: [...] "t was a very equitable arrangement ... I had the responsibility {{and he had the}} authority". Late in the next year Clyde Packer launched A Current Affair on the Nine network, with Mike Willesee hosting. In 1972, Willesee organised for A Current Affair to have an on-air interview with then-union leader, Bob Hawke, during an industrial dispute. When Frank heard of the arrangement he vetoed the decision to allow Hawke on his network, undermining Clyde's authority. Willesee later declared: [...] "You can't run a current affairs program, as you couldn't run a serious newspaper, and have people tell you you can't have the leader of the Trade Union movement". Packer resigned his posts at the Nine Network and ACP, and later reflected on the split: [...] "I suspect my father was as glad to <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> as I was to get rid of him".|$|E
2500|$|Numerous {{things are}} {{different}} throughout the game if the player is playing as a neutral character. For example, the letter from Blackmore is to Cory, not Torque, telling him Torque doesn't really love him. During the scene when Torque sees Killjoy on his TV, Killjoy reminds Torque that Blackmore had manipulated Cory. When the helicopter attacks, it is piloted by Jordan, and in the drowning pool, Torque fights Copperfield. Later, Blackmore reveals that he gave Cory spiked drugs prior to Cory's murder of Malcolm and subsequent suicide. In the final battle, neither Blackmore nor Torque is able to win, and when they approach one another they are repelled away from touching. Blackmore points out [...] "Looks like we're going {{to play this game}} a while longer. I couldn't change you, and you couldn't <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> The ties that bind, they'll keep us connected, but apart. And I'll be right here, standing over your shoulder." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I was Baltimore {{to make a}} statement. I {{wanted to}} show Pittsburgh they'd {{made a mistake in}} <b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> I mean, I wasn't a 'yes' man for coach Chuck Noll. If you cursed me, I cursed you back. I messed over the curfew rules a lot and, in {{training}} camp, I'd park my car in the coaches' spaces." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I have to {{say that}} it was {{probably}} the right decision because look where they are now. All Mr Fayed has to say is 'there's my record'. At the time <b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> was a harsh decision. A director at the club told me I was going to be the Alex Fergusonof Fulham. I signed a five-year contract... and four months later I was sacked." [...] Adams speaking in July 2009.|$|R
6000|$|If {{she were}} really engaged I {{would go away}} and hide myself [...] in the furthermost corner of the world. Siberia or Central [...] Africa {{would be the same}} to me.

5000|$|... "Without You" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{rock band}} Hinder, that was the second single {{released}} from their 2008 album Take It to the Limit. It was released as a digital download on September 23, 2008. A music video was produced for the song, featuring actors Kellan Lutz and Aimee Teegarden. [...] "I play the bad boyfriend," [...] Lutz told MTV. [...] "Aimee is the sweet cheerleader girl ... who shouldn't be with me. I lead her life {{on the wrong track}} until she <b>gets</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> and her life finally goes to where it should go. She graduates high school, while I am left in the dust." ...|$|R
6000|$|Harold {{raised his}} hand. [...] "Silence, my friends. Let us {{be fair and}} just as it becomes Englishmen. There are villains of all nations, {{and it is not}} because four caitiffs have thought to do a good service to their duke by <b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> that we should blame men who will abhor this crime {{as much as we can}} do. First let us see if Beorn is right as to this man. Hold a torch to his face. It is Fitz-Urse truly. He was of knightly blood, but has died in a most unknightly business. Wulf's dagger is still in his throat. Let us see if we know {{anything}} of the others." ...|$|R
60|$|As I saw my {{companion}} was desirous <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> I asked where I {{was to find}} the person in whose hands were left {{the map of the}} estate, and other particulars connected with the sale. The agent who had this in possession, I was told, lived at the town of --, which I was informed, and indeed knew well, was distant five miles and a bittock, which may pass in a country where they are less lavish of their land for two or three more. Being somewhat afraid of the fatigue of walking so far, I inquired if a horse or any sort of carriage was to be had, and was answered in the negative.|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{are in a}} great {{hurry to}} <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> I think. I suppose Mr. Crawley has been {{complaining}} again about the cream in his tea." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope not," [...] Jack said. [...] "I am {{here because}} I am {{a sort of}} cousin of the Mayor of Southampton. He wanted me to serve in his shop. I stood it for a time, but I hated it, and at last I had a row with his foreman and knocked him down, so I was kicked out into the streets; and I suppose he didn't like seeing me about, and so took this means <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> He needn't have been in such a hurry, for if he had waited a few days I should have gone, for I had shipped as a boy on board of a ship about to sail for the colonies." ...|$|R
5000|$|Burns' {{contract}} was not renewed and expired in Spring 2008, reportedly saying {{in an interview}} that, [...] "Fox News has {{told me that my}} contract will be terminated within the next 2 months, perhaps sooner. I was given no reason. It certainly {{has nothing to do with}} ratings; the last episode of Fox News Watch was the second highest-rated weekend show on all 3 cable news networks and the program has almost been in the top 4 or 5. I have no theory, none, why they are <b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> Although I heard rumors, I have never heard reasons." [...] Fox News responded by saying Burns's {{contract was}} a contributor agreement rather than a talent agreement. Burns was replaced by Jon Scott.|$|R
60|$|REGINALD. No, I didn't: I {{did it to}} <b>get</b> her <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> What {{would you}} do if you were fool enough to marry a woman thirty years younger than yourself, and then found that she didnt care for you, and was in love with a young fellow with a face like a mushroom.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{have one}} {{advantage}}, Harry--one advantage {{over her and}} some others. I am free. The chains have, hurt me sorely during my slavery; but I am free, {{and the price of}} my servitude remains. He had written home-would you believe that? while I was living with him he had written home to say that evidence should be collected for <b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> And yet he would sometimes be civil, hoping to cheat me into inadvertencies. He would ask that man to dine, and then of a sudden would be absent; and during this he was ordering that evidence should be collected! Evidence, indeed! The same servants have lived with me through it all If I could now bring forward evidence I could make it all clear as the day. But there needs no care for a woman's honor, though a man may have to guard his by collecting evidence!" ...|$|R

60|$|But again, a selfish, greedy {{man comes}} often, and sits in my clothes. A man who frets away his life, {{planning}} {{how to get}} more money--more food, more clothes, more pleasures for himself; a man so busy thinking of the many things he needs he has no time to dwell upon the needs of others. He deems himself {{the centre of the}} universe. You would imagine, hearing him grumbling, that the world had been created and got ready against the time when he should come to take his pleasure in it. He would push and trample, heedless, reaching towards these many desires of his; and when, grabbing, he misses, he curses Heaven for its injustice, and men and women for getting in his path. He is not a nice man, in any way. I wish, as I say, he would not come so often and sit in my clothes. He persists that he is I, and that I am only a sentimental fool, spoiling his chances. Sometimes, for a while, I <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> him, but he always comes back; and then he <b>gets</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> and I become him. It is very confusing. Sometimes I wonder if I really am myself.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am afraid, Lizzie,' he openly answered, 'that {{you left}} London to <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> It is not {{flattering}} to my self-love, but I am afraid you did.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'And you {{naturally}} want to <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> {{before it}} can happen,' he said. 'I don't wonder. I'm not vain... Well, I'll go. I knew I had no chance. Good-bye.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you, though!" [...] cried Peters as a woman's {{voice and}} heavy steps sounded in the passage. [...] "We'll soon see about that. This way, officers, if you please.

6000|$|... "Yes, that's it," [...] Brissenden laughed. [...] "Pretty good title, eh? 'Ephemera'--it {{is the one}} word. And you're {{responsible}} for it, what of your man, who is always the erected, the vitalized inorganic, the latest of the ephemera, the creature of temperature strutting his little space on the thermometer.

40|$|My {{wife and}} I visited Brazil in December and January this past year, {{spending}} the Christmas and New Year’s holidays there. Since {{my wife is}} Brazilian, I have taken an interest in exploring Brazilian culture and history. This interest, {{and the fact that}} we were in Brazil for a month, prompted me to take a couple of days to visit various libraries and see how things are done there. I visited three basic types of libraries in the capital district of Brasilia. The Universidade de Brasilia, Biblioteca Central (the University of Brasilia Central Library), two different types of public libraries, and the government libraries of the Senado Federal (Senate) and the Camara dos Deputados (House of Deputies). I could not visit the National Library of Brazil, because it remained in Rio de Janeiro when the new capital was built in the 1960 s. There has been some discussion of moving it to Brasilia, but to this day, that has not happened. I would still like to visit there anyway, but Rio was covered on our previous trip, and I don’t know when I will get there again. My main objective was to visit each of these places, talk with the librarians, and discover what things are the same and what things are different from what we do here in the States. What I discovered is that, although there are many differences, there are also many things that seem very familiar or are just virtually the same as here. While talking with the librarians, through my wife who graciously translated, I asked several questions both out of general interest and in the areas I am most familiar. Of the three types of libraries, those in the government and academic libraries were the most willing to talk with me; whereas, those in the public libraries seemed more interested in <b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> More on that later...|$|R
