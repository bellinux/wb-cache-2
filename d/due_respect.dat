5|$|Many {{contemporary}} Orthodox scholars {{rule that}} the area {{in front of the}} Wall has the status of a synagogue and must be treated with <b>due</b> <b>respect.</b> This is the view upheld by the authority in charge of the wall. As such, men and married women are expected to cover their heads upon approaching the Wall, and to dress appropriately. When departing, the custom is to walk backwards away from the Wall. On Saturdays, it is forbidden to enter the area with electronic devices, including cameras, which infringe on the sanctity of the Sabbath.|$|E
5|$|The triumphal archway at the {{boundary}} between Fleur-de-Lys and Santa Venera {{is known as the}} Wignacourt Arch or the Fleur-de-Lys Gate. It has three doorways, and it is adorned with Wignacourt's coat of arms and three sculpted fleurs-de-lis, the heraldic symbols of Wignacourt. The suburb of Fleur-de-Lys got its name from this arch, and fleurs-de-lis are featured on the flags and coat of arms of both Fleur-de-Lys and Santa Venera. One of the original plaques on the arch gave <b>due</b> <b>respect</b> to the engineer Bontadino de Bontadini. The arch together with the aqueduct's water towers and fountains were the first expression of baroque architecture in Malta.|$|E

25|$|The Department of the Taoiseach {{has issued}} {{guidelines}} to assist persons in giving <b>due</b> <b>respect</b> {{to the national}} flag. Observance of the guidelines {{is a matter for}} each individual as there are no statutory requirements. It is expected, however, that the national flag will be treated at all times with appropriate respect by those who use it. The Department has general responsibility in relation to the national flag and this is primarily concerned with the protocol for the flying of the flag. The Department's role, therefore, is an advisory one.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, a devadasi was {{believed}} to be immune from widowhood and was called akhanda saubhagyavati ("woman never separated from good fortune"). Since she was wedded to a divine deity, {{she was supposed to be}} one of the especially welcome guests at weddings and was regarded as a bearer of good fortune. At weddings, people would receive a string of the tali (wedding lock) prepared by her, threaded with a few beads from her own necklace. The presence of a devadasi on any religious occasion in the house of an upper caste member was regarded as sacred and she was treated with <b>due</b> <b>respect</b> and was presented with gifts.|$|E
25|$|When the {{national}} flag has become worn or frayed {{it is no}} longer fit for display, and should not be used in any manner implying disrespect. The national flag, when used as a decoration, should always be treated with <b>due</b> <b>respect.</b> It may be used as a discreet lapel button or rosette or as part of a centrepiece for a table. When used in the latter context with the flags of other nations, {{the national}} flag should also be displayed in the place of honour on a nearby flag staff. Where multiple national flags are flown on festive occasions these should be of uniform dimensions. Bunting of the national colours may also be used on festive occasions.|$|E

25|$|While he {{supported}} the idea of government ruling by a virtuous king, his ideas contained a number of elements to limit the power of rulers. He argued for representing truth in language, and honesty was of paramount importance. Even in facial expression, truth must always be represented. Confucius believed that if a ruler is to lead correctly, by action, that orders would be unnecessary in that others will follow the proper actions of their ruler. In discussing {{the relationship between a}} king and his subject (or a father and his son), he underlined the need to give <b>due</b> <b>respect</b> to superiors. This demanded that the subordinates must advise their superiors if the superiors are considered to be taking a course of action that is wrong. Confucius believed in ruling by example, if you lead correctly, orders by force or punishment are not necessary.|$|E
25|$|Blackford still {{desired to}} be {{associated}} with the court so he could write the court reports. He was successfully nominated to run for the position of court reporter on the Whig ticket in 1853, but was defeated in the election by future Vice President of the United States Thomas Hendricks. After being defeated in his second election attempt after leaving the court, he briefly returned to private life. He opened a law office and took on one case which he argued before Judge David Wallace. He stumbled in making his arguments as he was unaccustomed to speaking publicly and he lost the case. He found the change of position embarrassing and was occasionally offended by the public and the court system for not showing him what he considered <b>due</b> <b>respect.</b> After the loss of his case he closed his law office.|$|E
25|$|Boris II {{was unable}} to stem the Kievan advance and found himself forced to accept Sviatoslav of Kiev as his ally and puppet-master, turning against the Byzantines. A Kievan {{campaign}} into Byzantine Thrace was defeated at Arcadiopolis in 970, and the new Byzantine Emperor John I Tzimiskes advanced northwards. Failing to secure {{the defense of the}} Balkan passes, Sviatoslav allowed the Byzantines to penetrate into Moesia and lay siege to the Bulgarian capital Preslav. Although Bulgarians and Russians joined in defending the city, the Byzantines managed to set afire the wooden structures and roofs with missiles, and they took the fortress. Boris II now became a captive of John I Tzimiskes, who continued to pursue the Russians, besieging Sviatoslav in Drăstăr (Silistra) while claiming to act as Boris' ally and protector and treating the Bulgarian monarch with <b>due</b> <b>respect.</b> After Sviatoslav had come to terms and set out for Kiev, the Byzantine emperor returned to Constantinople in triumph. Far from liberating Bulgaria as he had claimed, John brought along Boris II and his family, together with the contents of the Bulgarian imperial treasury in 971. In a public ceremony in Constantinople, Boris II was ritually divested of his imperial insignia and was given the Byzantine court title of magistros as compensation. The Bulgarian lands in Thrace and lower Moesia now became part of the Byzantine Empire and were placed under Byzantine governors.|$|E

He then told them {{to give him a}} part of their wealth. They all told him that after meeting the expenditure related to their commitments to the well being of their subjects, with due diligence of the status of their revenue, they would be happy to spare surplus, if any. Agastya, after considering this statement felt that they had no wealth to spare for him. On the advice of the three kings, he then approached Illwala, the King of asuras or danavas who was considered a very wealthy king.|$|R

500|$|Speaking in 2010, Miller {{commented on}} his {{approach}} to playing standards, which was more conservative than that of many others: [...] "I believe in giving <b>due</b> <b>respect</b> to the melody, playing it as true as possible, [...] a solo is a creative process that improves the melody." [...] He almost never transcribed recordings (something that jazz musicians are typically taught to do); Miller credited this with slowing his learning process, but also with allowing him to express himself more freely, as he reached his own understanding of the compositions he played.|$|E

500|$|The song follows in a {{tradition}} established by singers such as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger, of attributing emotions and actions to a musical instrument.

Contributing to Harrison's sense of injustice in [...] "This Guitar", he and his tour musicians believed that detractors had ignored the successful aspects of the 1974 shows – which blended rock, jazz, funk and Indian classical music – and had focused instead on his failure to pay <b>due</b> <b>respect</b> to the legacy of the Beatles. Rolling Stones scathing assessment of Harrison's tour and accompanying album, Dark Horse, represented an about-face by the publication, previously one of his most vocal supporters, and led to Harrison's continued resentment towards the magazine over subsequent decades.|$|E
