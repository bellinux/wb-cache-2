25|$|In the 19th century, the {{surgical}} techniques of J.F. Dieffenbach (1792–1847) popularized the nasolabial flap for nasal reconstruction, {{for which it}} remains a foundational nose surgery procedure. The nasolabial flap can be either superiorly based or inferiorly based; of which the superiorly based flap is the more practical rhinoplastic application, {{because it has a}} more versatile arc of rotation, and the donor-site scar is inconspicuous. Depending upon the how the defect lay upon the nose, the flap pedicle-base can be incorporated either solely to the nasal reconstruction, or it can be divided into a second stage procedure. The blood supply for the flap pedicle are the transverse branches of the contralateral angular artery (the <b>facial</b> <b>artery</b> terminus parallel to the nose), and by a confluence of blood vessels from the angular artery and from the supraorbital artery in the medial canthus, (the angles formed by the meeting of the upper and lower eyelids). Therefore, the incisions for harvesting the nasolabial flap do not continue superiorly beyond the medial canthal tendon. The nasolabial flap is a random flap that is emplaced with the proximal (near) portion resting upon the lateral wall of the nose, and the distal (far) portion resting upon the cheek, which contains the main angular artery, and so is perfused with retrograde arterial flow.|$|E
40|$|The common carotid arteries are {{the major}} source of blood supply to the region of head and neck. Normally {{external}} carotid artery gives eight branches in the region of neck.

Cerebral angiography provides more detailed information on blood flow of ophthalmic artery as well as surrounding orbital area which cannot be covered by fundus fluorescein angiography.

We retrospectively reviewed cerebral angiography of 7 patients (4 hyaluronic acid [HA] and 3 autologous fat-injected cases) showing ophthalmic artery and its branches occlusion after cosmetic facial filler injections, and underwent intra-arterial thrombolysis. On selective ophthalmic artery angiograms, all fat-injected patients showed a large filling defect on the proximal ophthalmic artery, whereas the HA-injected patients showed occlusion of the distal branches of the ophthalmic artery. Three HA-injected patients revealed diminished distal runoff of the internal maxillary and <b>facial</b> <b>arteries,</b> which clinically corresponded with skin necrosis.

40|$|Angiographic {{techniques}} {{have been used}} to study the influence of intracisternally injected haemoglobin on the diameters of the main intrathecal and representative extrathecal (ascending pharyngeal and <b>facial)</b> cranial <b>arteries</b> of the anaesthetized pig. Intracisternal injection of haemoglobin caused concentration-dependent decreases in the diameters of intra- but not extrathecal arteries suggesting that haemoglobin possesses local vasoconstrictor activity. When infused into one ascending pharyngeal artery, acetylcholine (ACh) caused slight dilatation of the intrathecal arteries but no change in the diameters of the ascending pharyngeal and <b>facial</b> <b>arteries.</b> The dilator response induced by ACh in the intrathecal arteries was converted into frank constriction after intracisternal injection of haemoglobin (cerebrospinal fluid concentration approximately 2 × 10 − 5 m). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that subarachnoid haemoglobin can induce cerebral artery constriction by acting as an extraluminal ‘sink’ for intimally released endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) and may be relevant to the pathogenesis of vasospasm after subarachnoid haemorrhage in man...|$|R

40|$|Endocrinopathic {{laminitis}} (EL) is a vascular {{condition of}} the equine hoof resulting in severe lameness with both welfare and economic implications. EL occurs in association with equine metabolic syndrome and equine Cushing's disease. Vascular dysfunction, most commonly due to endothelial dysfunction, is associated with cardiovascular risk in people with metabolic syndrome and Cushing's syndrome. We tested the hypothesis that horses with EL have vascular, specifically endothelial, dysfunction. Healthy horses (n = 6) and horses with EL (n = 6) destined for euthanasia were recruited. We studied vessels from the hooves (laminar artery, laminar vein) and the facial skin (<b>facial</b> skin <b>arteries)</b> by small vessel wire myography. The response to vasoconstrictors phenylephrine (10 - 9 - 10 - 5 M) and 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 HT; 10 - 9 - 10 - 5 M) and the vasodilator acetylcholine (10 - 9 - 10 - 5 M) was determined. In comparison with healthy controls, acetylcholine-induced relaxation was dramatically reduced in all intact vessels from horses with EL (% relaxation of healthy laminar arteries 323. 5 ± 94. 1 % v EL 90. 8 ± 4. 4 %, P = 0. 01, laminar veins 129. 4 ± 14. 8 % v EL 71. 2 ± 4. 1 %, P = 0. 005 and <b>facial</b> skin <b>arteries</b> 182. 0 ± 40. 7 % v EL 91. 4 ± 4. 5 %, P = 0. 01). In addition, contractile responses to phenylephrine and 5 HT were increased in intact laminar veins from horses with EL compared with healthy horses; these differences were endothelium-independent. Sensitivity to phenylephrine was reduced in intact laminar arteries (P = 0. 006) and veins (P = 0. 009) from horses with EL. Horses with EL exhibit significant vascular dysfunction in laminar vessels and in <b>facial</b> skin <b>arteries.</b> The systemic nature of the abnormalities suggest this dysfunction {{is associated with the}} underlying endocrinopathy and not local changes to the hoof...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY To detect {{stenosis}} in the {{carotid artery}} with a bidirec-tional continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound device, the following non-invasive procedure, applied on 800 patients and compared with 249 angiograms of 186 patients, {{has proved to}} be about 90 % reliable. Measurements of flow signals were taken over the terminal branches of the ophthalmic artery (supratrochlear and supraorbital arteries) and averaged. Compression of superficial temporal and <b>facial</b> <b>arteries</b> revealed flow direction and common carotid artery compression revealed the supplying blood vessel and the effectiveness of the circle of Willis. Measurements over the common carotid arteries were used to evaluate peripheral resistance. A set of eight criteria was used; the diagnostic value of each criterion was calculated by comparing 138 pathological Doppler findings in 123 patients with the angiograms. If reverse flow direction in supratrochlear or supraorbital artery was used alone, only 43 % correct diagnoses would have resulted. A more severe stenosis is not necessarily correlated with a more weighted criterion; a subset of criteria is less efficient than the combination of all criteria. Application during 32 extracranial endarterectomies on 28 patients informed the surgeon immediately about the hemodynamic effect of the surgical intervention. Rethrom-bosis was diagnosed in two patients by postoperative Doppler exami-nation...|$|R

40|$|When jaw {{resection}} is {{necessitated by}} mandibular tumors, deformities and dys- or hypofunction of the jaw are unavoidable. To secure recovery from impairment, prostheses of the jaw bone, for instance, artificial substances or autologous bone, are usually utilized. When an artificial substance is used, however, {{it is difficult}} to obtain satisfactory results due to poor tissue affinity and compatibility. When an autologous transplantation is performed, healthy tissue other than the lesion it self is inevitably damaged in addtion to bone fragments being required from the patients. Recent reports have shown that bone regeneration occurs without bone transplantation if the periosteum is left behind at the time of jaw resection. Thus, {{attention has been paid to}} bone regeneration by the periosteum, especially among young patients. To my knowledge, there have been no reports concerning vascular and bone regeneration after subperiosteal hemimandibulectomy. Subperiosteal hemimandibulectomy, including removal of the mandibular head, was performed in rabbits. Dry-cast models were prepared by resin injection into the carotid artery, and transparent specimens were prepared by chloropercha injection into the carotid artery. Regeneration of blood vessels and bone were observed macro- and microscopically. During the initial stage, blood supply to the site of the bone defect was made mainly from periosteal blood vessels. The periosteal blood vessels, related to bone regeneration, gradually developed and anastomosed with the blood vessels extending from the bonr marrow, resulting in a fine vascular network. The external carotid, facial, and transverse <b>facial</b> <b>arteries</b> extended to the site of the bone defect approximately thirty days after the operation. The periosteal, bone marrow and extramaxillary blood vessels probably play an important role in bone regeneration...|$|R
40|$|Background Extended {{soft tissue}} defects {{of the face}} are {{difficult}} to reconstruct, and autologous tissue transfers usually lead to poor cosmetic and functional outcomes. We judged that composite tissue transplantation could be valuable in facial reconstructive surgery. Methods We transplanted the central and lower face of a brain-dead woman onto a woman aged 38 years who had suffered amputation of distal nose, both lips, chin, and adjacent parts of the cheeks. Transplantation consisted of revascularisation of right and left <b>facial</b> <b>arteries</b> and veins (ischaemic time 4 h), mucosal repair of oral and nasal vestibules, bilateral anastomoses of infraorbital and mental sensitive nerves, joining of mimic muscles with motor nerve suture on mandibular branch of the left facial nerve, and skin closure. Immunosuppressive treatment was with thymoglobulin, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. Two infusions of donor bone-marrow cells were given. Follow-up included routine tests, biopsies, physiotherapy, and psychological support. Findings The initial postoperative course was uneventful. No surgical complication occurred. Bone-marrow graft and immunosuppression were well tolerated. Mild clinical signs of rejection were seen at day 20. Increased corticoids initially did not reverse rejection, but signs of rejection disappeared after three boluses of prednisone. Anatomical and psychological integration and recovery of sensation were excellent. At {{the end of the}} first postoperative week, the patient could eat, and speech improved quickly. Passive transmission of muscle contractions to the graft already exists; physiotherapy is being done to restore dynamic motions around the lips. Interpretation The 4 -month outcome demonstrates the feasibility of this procedure. The functional result will be assessed in the future, but this graft can already be deemed successful with respect to appearance, sensitivity, and acceptance by the patient...|$|R
