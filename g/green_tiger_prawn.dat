Population {{characteristics}} of <b>green</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>prawns,</b> Penaeus semisulcatus taken by shrimp trawlers in Jizan area was investigated {{during the period}} from August 2002 to July 2003. Monthly length-frequency data were used to estimate the growth curves and related parameters for both females and males. The mean asymptotic cara-pace length (L∞), growth constant (K), amplitude of growth (C) and winter point (WP) were respectively, 58. 5 mm, 0. 8 year 1, 0. 100 and 0. 800 for females and 44. 9 mm, 0. 7 year 1, 0. 400 & 0. 100 for males. The annual mortality coefficients and current exploitation rate for fe-males were estimated at slightly higher values (Z = 3. 937 year 1, M = 1. 649 year 1, F = 2. 288 year 1 and Ecurrent = 0. 581) than those of males (Z = 3. 599 year 1, M = 1. 588 year 1, F = 2. 011 year 1 and Ecurrent = 0. 550).

The degree of toxicity of the three metals {{were in the order}} Cd > In > Cu. Based on the LCso values, two sublethal concentrations of copper (0. 7 ppm and 1. 4 ppm), cadmium (0. 25 ppm and 0. 5 ppm) and zinc (0. 5 ppm and 1. 00 ppm) were selected for bioaccumulation, physio-biochemical and histopathological studies. In all the lethal and sublethal exposures, blackening of the gill lamellae and exoskeleton was noticed. The accumulation of metals was pronounced in the hepatopancreas, gills, muscle, tail and carapace. The results of the study suggest that the shrimps could not regulate the accumulation of Cu. Cd and In. The bioaccumulation in the selected organsltissues was found to be dose dependent. In the physio-biochemical studies. an increase in the respiration rate was found in shrimps exposed to lethal concentrations of copper. cadmium and zinc. The biochemical components, carbohydrate, protein and lipid were found to get reduced during the various phases of metal exposure. The observed change in the proximate components is attributed to the alterations in the enzymes involved in cellular energy generation processes. inhibition of protein synthesis by the alteration in the DNA and RNA content and increases in the free fatty acid content due to changes in the synthesis and mobilization of lipids.

Abstract It is common to model the dynamics of fisheries using natural and fishing mortality rates estimated independently using two separate analyses. Fishing mortality is routinely estimated from widely available logbook data, whereas natural mortality estimations have often required more specific, less frequently available, data. However, {{in the case of the}} fishery for brown <b>tiger</b> <b>prawn</b> (Penaeus esculentus) in Moreton Bay, both fishing and natural mortality rates have been estimated from logbook data. The present work extended the fishing mortality model to incorporate an eco-physiological response of <b>tiger</b> <b>prawn</b> to temperature, and allowed recruitment timing to vary from year to year. These ecological characteristics of the dynamics of this fishery were ignored in the separate model that estimated natural mortality. Therefore, we propose to estimate both natural and fishing mortality rates within a single model using a consistent set of hypotheses. This approach was applied to Moreton Bay brown <b>tiger</b> <b>prawn</b> data collected between 1990 and 2010.

40|$|AbstractThe {{cover of}} {{seagrasses}} and macroalgae, landings and fishery-independent measures of spawning stock and recruitment for brown <b>tiger</b> <b>prawns,</b> were monitored immediately following a major cyclone in Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia in March 1999. Anecdotal {{evidence on the}} extent of seagrass from 1990 to 1998 suggests that the cyclone caused a major, immediate disruption and loss of the seagrass/macroalgal beds (to ≤ 2 % cover), the critical prawn nursery habitat, and mangroves in the shallow inshore waters of the system. Prawn landings and recruitment to the fishery were not affected in the year of the cyclone, but were markedly lower in the two years immediately afterwards and then increased as the cover of macrophytes increased to over 40 % in 2003. <b>Tiger</b> <b>prawn</b> landings and catch rates were not affected in Shark Bay, a system 500  km south of Exmouth Gulf that did not experience cyclonic disturbance. Seagrasses in Exmouth Gulf showed a succession of species from small colonising species (Halophila ovalis and Halodule uninervis) to larger, broad-leaved species (Cymodocea serrulata, Syringodium isoetifolium) only two years after the cyclone. The recruitment and landings of <b>tiger</b> <b>prawns</b> were correlated significantly with the total cover of macroalgae and seagrass. The large loss of seagrass and macroalgae reduced the settling habitat for postlarvae and the nursery habitat for juvenile <b>tiger</b> <b>prawns,</b> probably leading to the lower recruitment to the fishery. These findings suggest that the extent of seagrass and macroalgae are some of the factors defining the productivity of the <b>tiger</b> <b>prawn</b> fishery in Exmouth Gulf...|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} species for aquaculture are Marsupenaeus japonicus (Kuruma prawn), Fenneropenaeus chinensis (Chinese prawn), Penaeus monodon (giant <b>tiger</b> <b>prawn)</b> and Litopenaeus vannamei (whiteleg prawn).|$|R
40|$|Type of {{business}} {{that we want}} to plunge is business partner that is to say livestock (Penaeus Monodon) in the pond with commercial. Main causes why we choose livestock <b>tiger</b> <b>prawn</b> because this business is very clear prospects, which demand for prawn very high in the local market also oversea and it having ability to give a high profit. Members of partnership are agreed to use Tok Bali <b>Tiger</b> <b>Prawn</b> for name of their company. This livestock have operation at Lot 195, Kampung Cherang Ruku, Daerah Semerak, Jajahan Pasir Puteh, and Kelantan. This location is very applicable for livestock <b>tiger</b> <b>prawn</b> and many facilities at there like nearly the road, river, electrical, water supply and telephone. These businesses expect will start on for starting that. We need RM 260 000 for capital contribution from members of partnership is RM 120 000 and balance is loan from Bank Pertanian Malaysia Berhad...|$|R
