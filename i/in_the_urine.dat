5|$|Excess calcium <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>urine</b> (hypercalciuria) occurs due to {{increased}} bone demineralisation with acidosis. Bones {{are mainly composed of}} calcium phosphate. The phosphate reacts with the acid, and the calcium is excreted by the kidneys.|$|E
5|$|In about 90% {{of cases}} of neuroblastoma, {{elevated}} levels of catecholamines or their metabolites are found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>urine</b> or blood. Catecholamines and their metabolites include dopamine, homovanillic acid (HVA), and/or vanillylmandelic acid (VMA).|$|E
5000|$|This {{is because}} {{patients}} experience polyuria (an excretion of over 2.5 liters of urine per day), and that <b>the</b> <b>urine</b> content {{does not have}} an elevated glucose concentration, as opposed to diabetes mellitus.

5|$|Of the 40% of {{patients}} who develop kidney involvement, almost all have evidence (visible or on urinalysis) of blood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>urine.</b> More than half also have proteinuria (protein <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>urine),</b> which in one eighth is severe enough to cause nephrotic syndrome (generalised swelling due to low protein content of the blood). While abnormalities on urinalysis may continue for a long time, only 1% of all HSP patients develop chronic kidney disease. Hypertension (high blood pressure) may occur. Protein loss and high blood pressure, {{as well as the}} features on biopsy of the kidney if performed, may predict progression to advanced kidney disease. Adults are more likely than children to develop advanced kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) {{kidney failure}} {{is the result}} of {{ethylene}} glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12–24 hours after getting into antifreeze; in dogs, at 36–72 hours after getting into antifreeze. During this stage, severe kidney failure is developing secondary to calcium oxalate crystals forming in the kidneys. Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and inappetance may be seen. Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis, red blood cells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>urine,</b> excess proteins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>urine,</b> lower back pain, decreased or absent production of urine, elevated blood concentration of potassium, and acute kidney failure. If kidney failure occurs it is typically reversible, although weeks or months of supportive care including hemodialysis may be required before kidney function returns.|$|E
5|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} the most {{frequent}} bacterial infection in women. They occur most frequently {{between the ages of}} 16 and 35years, with 10% of women getting an infection yearly and more than 40–60% having an infection {{at some point in their}} lives. Recurrences are common, with nearly half of people getting a second infection within a year. Urinary tract infections occur four times more frequently in females than males. Pyelonephritis occurs between 20–30 times less frequently. They {{are the most}} common cause of hospital acquired infections accounting for approximately 40%. Rates of asymptomatic bacteria <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>urine</b> increase with age from two to seven percent in women of child bearing age to as high as 50% in elderly women in care homes.

5|$|A {{chelating}} agent is a molecule {{with at least}} two negatively charged groups that allow it to form complexes with metal ions with multiple positive charges, such as lead. The chelate that is thus formed is nontoxic and can be excreted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>urine,</b> initially at up to 50 times the normal rate. The {{chelating agent}}s used for treatment of lead poisoning are edetate disodium calcium (CaNa2EDTA), dimercaprol (BAL), which are injected, and succimer and d-penicillamine, which are administered orally.|$|E
5|$|Chronic {{prostatitis}} in {{the forms}} of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome and chronic bacterial prostatitis (not acute bacterial prostatitis or asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis) may cause recurrent urinary tract infections in males.

5|$|Infection with P.falciparum {{may result}} in {{cerebral}} malaria, a form of severe malaria that involves encephalopathy. It is associated with retinal whitening, which may be a useful clinical sign in distinguishing malaria from other causes of fever. Enlarged spleen, enlarged liver or both of these, severe headache, low blood sugar, and hemoglobin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>urine</b> with renal failure may occur. Complications may include spontaneous bleeding, coagulopathy, and shock.|$|E

5|$|The major toxins {{involved}} in A.muscaria poisoning are muscimol (3-hydroxy-5-aminomethyl-1-isoxazole, an unsaturated cyclic hydroxamic acid) {{and the related}} amino acid ibotenic acid. Muscimol {{is the product of}} the decarboxylation (usually by drying) of ibotenic acid. Muscimol and ibotenic acid were discovered in the mid-20th century. Researchers in England, Japan, and Switzerland showed that the effects produced were due mainly to ibotenic acid and muscimol, not muscarine. These toxins are not distributed uniformly in the mushroom. Most are detected in the cap of the fruit, a moderate amount in the base, with the smallest amount in the stalk. Quite rapidly, between 20 and 90 minutes after ingestion, a substantial fraction of ibotenic acid is excreted unmetabolised <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>urine</b> of the consumer. Almost no muscimol is excreted when pure ibotenic acid is eaten, but muscimol is detectable <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>urine</b> after eating A.muscaria, which contains both ibotenic acid and muscimol.|$|E
5|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of malaria typically begin 8–25 days following infection; however, symptoms may occur later in those who have taken antimalarial medications as prevention. Initial manifestations of the disease—common to all malaria species—are similar to flu-like symptoms, and can resemble other conditions such as sepsis, gastroenteritis, and viral diseases. The presentation may include headache, fever, shivering, joint pain, vomiting, hemolytic anemia, jaundice, hemoglobin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>urine,</b> retinal damage, and convulsions.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} {{hyponatremia}} is typically classified by a person's fluid status into low volume, normal volume, and high volume. Low volume hyponatremia can occur from diarrhea, vomiting, diuretics, and sweating. Normal volume hyponatremia {{is divided into}} cases with dilute urine and concentrated <b>urine.</b> Cases <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> <b>urine</b> is dilute include adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and drinking too much water or too much beer. Cases <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> <b>urine</b> is concentrated include syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). High volume hyponatremia can occur from heart failure, liver failure, and kidney failure. Conditions {{that can lead to}} falsely low sodium measurements include high protein levels such as in multiple myeloma, high blood fat levels, and high blood sugar.|$|R

5|$|Urinary {{catheterization}} {{increases the}} risk for urinary tract infections. The risk of bacteriuria (bacteria <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>urine)</b> is between three and six percent per day and prophylactic antibiotics are not effective in decreasing symptomatic infections. The risk of an associated infection can be decreased by catheterizing only when necessary, using aseptic technique for insertion, and maintaining unobstructed closed drainage of the catheter.|$|E
5|$|Arterial blood gas {{measurement}} is usually performed {{to demonstrate the}} acidosis; this requires taking a blood sample from an artery. Subsequent measurements (to ensure treatment is effective), may be taken from a normal blood test taken from a vein, as there is little difference between the arterial and the venous pH. Ketones can be measured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>urine</b> (acetoacetate) and blood (β-hydroxybutyrate). When compared with urine acetoacetate testing, capillary blood β-hydroxybutyrate determination can reduce the need of admission, shorten the duration of hospital admission and potentially reduce the costs of hospital care. At very high levels, capillary blood ketone measurement becomes imprecise.|$|E
50|$|It is very efficient, since {{more than}} 25,000 mmoles/day of sodium is {{filtered}} into the nephron, but only ~100 mmoles/day, {{or less than}} 0.4% remains <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final <b>urine.</b>|$|R

The diagnosis may be suspected when calcium oxalate crystals are seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>urine</b> or when acidosis or an increased osmol gap is present in the blood. Diagnosis may be confirmed by measuring ethylene glycol levels in the blood; however, many hospitals do not have the ability to perform this test.|$|E
5|$|Hemorrhagic cystitis, {{characterized}} by blood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>urine,</b> can occur secondary {{to a number}} of causes including: infections, radiation therapy, underlying cancer, medications and toxins. Medications that commonly cause this problem include the chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide with rates of 2 to 40%. Eosinophilic cystitis is a rare condition where eosinophiles are present in the bladder wall. Signs and symptoms are similar to a bladder infection. Its cause is not entirely clear; however, it may be linked to food allergies, infections, and medications among others.|$|E
5|$|Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP), {{also known}} as IgA vasculitis, anaphylactoid purpura, purpura rheumatica, and Schönlein–Henoch purpura, is a disease of the skin, mucous membranes, and {{sometimes}} other organs that most commonly affects children. In the skin, the disease causes palpable purpura (small, raised areas of bleeding underneath the skin), often with joint pain and abdominal pain. With kidney involvement, {{there may be a}} loss of small amounts of blood and protein <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>urine</b> (hematuria and proteinuria), but this usually goes unnoticed; in a small proportion of cases, the kidney involvement proceeds to chronic kidney disease. HSP is often preceded by an infection, such as a throat infection.|$|E
