Nine Zeros from Zuihō surprised and attacked the Enterprise group, attacking the climbing aircraft <b>from</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the sun. In the resulting engagement, four Zeros, three Wildcats, and two TBFs were shot down, with another two TBFs and a Wildcat forced by heavy damage to return to Enterprise.|$|E
5|$|Military decorum at Fort Roach {{was less}} formal {{than in most}} units. Saluting was optional, and unit members called each other by their first names. Hal Roach Studios did not have barracks, so {{commuting}} from home was commonplace. Men <b>from</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the area were billeted at nearby Page Military Academy.|$|E
5|$|Atangana {{won over}} other chiefs and headmen through gifts, tax cuts, flattery, and {{intervention}} on their behalf. He lavished attention on visitors <b>from</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> town, letting them stay at his palace and use his horses, and treating them to feasts. In addition to flattering them, this {{allowed him to}} monitor their activities and dealings with the colonial authorities. His clerk appointees in Jaunde informed him of the doings of both the Germans and his subjects. Atangana gained {{a substantial amount of}} wealth. He owned workshops and sold produce from five plantations to provision impressed railway construction workers.|$|E

5|$|David Boswell was amongst {{those in}} the 1980s who made the jump from the fanzine world when he began self-{{publishing}} Reid Fleming, World's Toughest Milkman in 1980. <b>From</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the same scene, Bill Marks started publishing the anthology Vortex in Toronto in 1982. Marks' Vortex Comics expanded into publishing other comics. The publisher gained publicity for Mister X, which employed the talents of Dean Motter, Gilberto and Jaime Hernandez and, later, Torontonians Seth and Jeffrey Morgan. Most notably, Marks picked up Chester Brown's Yummy Fur, a taboo-breaking series which started in 1983 as a self-published, photocopied minicomic. It had generated some buzz, and Vortex started publishing it professionally {{at the end of}} 1986. Yummy Furs stories were a mix of genres, with the improvised, surreal Ed the Happy Clown, straight adaptations of the Gospels, and revealing, bare-all autobiographical stories. Brown would become a major figure in Canadian comics.|$|E
5|$|The Coens {{referenced}} the noir tradition {{again with}} The Man Who Wasn't There (2001); a black-and-white crime melodrama set in 1949, {{it features a}} scene apparently staged to mirror the one <b>from</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> the Past pictured above. Lynch's Mulholland Drive (2001) continued in his characteristic vein, making the classic noir setting of Los Angeles the venue for a noir-inflected psychological jigsaw puzzle. British-born director Christopher Nolan's black-and-white debut, Following (1998), was an overt homage to classic noir. During the new century's first decade, {{he was one of}} the leading Hollywood directors of neo-noir with the acclaimed Memento (2000) and the remake of Insomnia (2002).|$|E
5|$|With the {{continuing}} {{improvement in the}} region's winemaking reputation, enotourism in Oregon has become a significant industry in its own right. On-site sales are becoming an increasingly {{important part of the}} business of Oregon winemaking, and other businesses that cater to wine tourists, such as lodging, fine restaurants, art galleries, have been appearing in places like Dundee, many of which have long been rural farming communities. Wine festivals and tastings are commonplace. It is estimated that enotourism contributed USD $207.5 million to the state economy in 2013 excluding sales at wineries and tasting rooms. There are approximately 1.8 million visits to Oregon wineries each year, 59% by Oregonians and 41% <b>from</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> state visitors. Major events drawing significant numbers of tourists to wine country include the International Pinot Noir Celebration which is held the last weekend of July every year since 1987 and the more recent Oregon Chardonnay Celebration.|$|E

5|$|It {{was felt}} that too long had elapsed {{in both cases}} between the German {{warships}} being spotted {{and the arrival of}} the strike force, and to rectify matters, it was decided to carry out reconnaissance in force, with formations of bombers being sent out over the North Sea to find and attack German warships. Their orders forbade them from attacking ships in port, infringing neutral airspace or even attacking German warships escorting merchant ships. A patrol on 29 September resulted in five Hampdens being shot down by Messerschmitt Bf 109s, of II./JG 77, but an attack by 24 Wellingtons of No. 149, No. 38 Squadron RAF and No. 115 Squadron RAF on 3 December was more successful, claiming a German minesweeper sunk (confirmed by German archives), while defensive fire from the Wellington gun turrets repelled attacks by German fighters, shooting one down without loss to the bombers. The German pilot shot down was future German ace Günther Specht. He was shot down by Corporal Copley of No. 38 Squadron RAF. The German ships were the Brummer and the minesweeper M1407 both sunk by unexploded bombs passing through the ship. A German report stated the attack was cleverly executed <b>from</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the sun and delivered to avoid the nearby civilian areas.|$|E
5|$|The University of Colorado's School of Pharmacy (SOP) {{began in}} 1911 as a {{division}} of the School of Medicine in Boulder. It became an independent college in 1913 and a school in 1957. It received its accreditation in 1938–1939 and awarded a B.S. in Pharmacy degree in 1995–1996 when it received a full accreditation status awarding the Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree by the ACPE. In 1986, the School of Pharmacy was administratively transferred to the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver. The physical transfer from Boulder and final consolidation of faculty, staff and students was completed between August and November 1992. In 2008, the school moved to the Anschutz Medical Campus, and offers medical and graduate degrees in pharmacy, the pharmaceutical sciences, molecular toxicology, and pharmaceutical outcomes research. 30% of its class is <b>from</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> state. In 2009, the NIH awarded $7,310,389 and $19,189,543 in grants towards the SOP and Pharmacology department, respectively. In 2011, the school will move into its new building, the Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences which will also be located on the Anschutz Medical Campus.|$|E

25|$|In the 1980s and 1990s {{many people}} moved in <b>from</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> state. Much of this {{immigration}} included {{the arrival of}} more liberal political influences of the urban areas of New York {{and the rest of}} New England in Vermont. The brand of Republicanism in Vermont has historically been a moderate one, and combined with the newcomers <b>from</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> state, this made Vermont friendlier to Democrats as the national GOP moved to the right. As evidence of this, in 1990 Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, was elected to Vermont's lone seat in the House as an independent. Sanders became the state's junior Senator in 2007. However, for his entire career in the House and Senate, Sanders has caucused with the Democrats and is counted as a Democrat for the purposes of committee assignments and voting for party leadership.|$|E
