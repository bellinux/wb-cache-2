40|$|The {{proposed}} {{method used}} {{to investigate the}} long-term perspectives of traffic on the European motorway network, and the identification of a common motorway network of EC interest had been conducted in three fundamental analysis stages: road transport demand; the high capacity road network (supply); and the translation of this demand in terms of traffic (matching of supply and demand). For the demand analysis, a prior role is devoted to international trips by road due to the context and objective of this study: 'ease the free flows of goods and persons inside the EC itself and between the EC and its partners'. The international flows modelization relies on a regional breakdown covering 129 cells where freight and passengers are distinguished. For freight, an origins/destinations matrix is compiled using the available data. For passengers, the origins/destinations flows are generated by a gravity model integrating population, GDP per capita (income indicator), tourist attractivity, distance and resistance factors for border crossing. The various networks include: 'theoretical network', reference network 1990 and the long-term network which would result from {{the realization of the}} various national motorway master plan for the member states, and the TEM project in Eastern Europe. Scenarios of traffic for the 2010 horizon are designed with the combination of two economic growth contexts, and three levels for the increase <b>in</b> <b>national</b> <b>traffic</b> and modal substitution. The scenarios results, even {{in the case of a}} sluggish economic growth, show important increases in traffic volumes (90 % average increase in total traffic on the trunk road network for the next 20 years). In the case of higher increase of road traffic, the modal transfer in favour of rail, everything equal elsewhere, do not supply a strong response. The diagnosis is slightly different if certain axes are considered, noticeably between Germany-Italy and Switzerland. This study strongly contributed to the EC Commission Transport Directorate in the definition of its road transport policy of which the brochure entitled: 'Trans-European Network: Towards a Master Plan for the Road Network and Road Traffic' is a summary. ...|$|E

(15 U. S. C. 260 a note) EPAct 2005 also called for the Department of Energy to evaluate the impact of Extended Daylight Saving Time on energy consumption in the United States and to submit a report to Congress. (15 U. S. C. 260 a note) This report presents the results of impacts of Extended Daylight Saving Time on the national energy consumption in the United States. The key findings are: (1) The total electricity savings of Extended Daylight Saving Time were about 1. 3 Tera Watt-hour (TWh). This corresponds to 0. 5 percent per each day of Extended Daylight Saving Time, or 0. 03 percent of electricity consumption over the year. In reference, the total 2007 electricity consumption in the United States was 3, 900 TWh. (2) In terms of national primary energy consumption, the electricity savings translate to a reduction of 17 Trillion Btu (TBtu) over the spring and fall Extended Daylight Saving Time periods, or roughly 0. 02 percent of total U. S. energy consumption during 2007 of 101, 000 TBtu. (3) During Extended Daylight Saving Time, electricity savings generally occurred over a three- to five-hour period in the evening with small increases in usage during the early-morning hours. On a daily percentage basis, electricity savings were slightly greater during the March (spring) extension of Extended Daylight Saving Time than the November (fall) extension. On a regional basis, some southern portions of the United States exhibited slightly smaller impacts of Extended Daylight Saving Time on energy savings compared to the northern regions, a result possibly due to a small, offsetting increase in household air conditioning usage. (4) Changes <b>in</b> <b>national</b> <b>traffic</b> volume and motor gasoline consumption for passenger vehicles in 2007 were determined to be statistically insignificant and therefore, could not be attributed to Extended Daylight Saving Time...|$|E
40|$|At the Swedish Maritime Administration, Sjöfartsverket, {{work with}} {{updating}} the nationalregulations on {{safety at sea}} and environmental effects has begun. The goal is to update theregulations and present them {{in a similar way}} as the international. The new regulation onfreeboard and stability for ships <b>in</b> <b>national</b> <b>traffic</b> are the first where this new structure is tobe applied. This thesis focus on an analysis of the changes in the regulation on load line and stability andthe effects that this may have on existing ships in some of the sheltered and near coast areas inthe home waters of Sweden. To achieve this, a number of general ship geometries have been designed to correspond to alarge number of existing ships, so that general conclusions from the study can be drawn. The ships that have been investigated are: traditional passenger ships, taxi boats, charterboats and Sea Trucks. The ships in the study have been examined with respect to stability, motions in waves andstability after damages to find out if and how the suggested changes of the regulations willaffect the fleet. But first, which are the major changes? Freeboard: Today the demand on height of hatch comings, air inlets etc are stipulated as aminimum distance above the freeboard. In the new directives the aim is sharper connectionsbetween freeboard and stability. Therefore the new demands {{are based on a minimum}} heelangel to the openings instead of a fixed distance. The minimum heel angel will be 30 ° ingeneral and 40 ° to engine room for the E and D areas. Stability: The Swedish demand on maximum righting lever arm, GZmax, for at least 30 ° ofheel, and a stability range of at least 60 ° is suggested to be abolished and replaced by weathercriterion with reduced wind pressure in the C and D areas for ships 24 m or longer. Stability after damage: The only difference from the current regulations is that restrictedflotation after damage is initiated also in the E area for new passenger ships. The results from the analysis show on small effects according to stability. On some shipsparticularly air inlets to engine room has to be moved to achieve the demands on freeboard. For ships maintaining service in the D area the ship motion calculation shows that windowsand doors can be exposed to quite large amounts of water for some headings and speeds,which means that windows and doors and there framings need to be of accurate strength. Finally the analysis shows that there is a possibility to fulfil the restricted demands onstability after damage if the bulkheads are made watertight. The traditional passenger shipwill however only survive damages in the fore and aft peaks. Damages elsewhere willeventually result in loss of the ship. NR 2014080...|$|E

40|$|Economic {{development}} and growing integration process {{of world trade}} increases the demand for road transport. In 2008, the freight transportation by road in Sweden reached 42 million tonne-kilometers. Sweden {{has a tradition of}} long and heavy trucks combinations. Lots of larger vehicles, with a maximum length of 25. 25 meters and weight of 60 tonnes, are used <b>in</b> <b>national</b> <b>traffic.</b> Heavier road transport and widely use of large vehicles contribute to the damages of pavement. According to a recent research by the VTI, total cost of road wear by freight transport in Sweden in 2005 was about 676 million SEK. If the weights of all vehicles were limited to 40 tonnes, according to the new EU rules, the cost of wear in 2005 would have been 140 million SEK less. Lots of studies about road damage caused by vehicle have been done since the last decades. It has been found that the dynamic tyre force {{plays an important role in}} the damages of pavement. However, the influence of vehicle-pavement interaction on pavement damage has not been investigated to any large extent yet. The aim of this study is to provide suitable computational truck models, study the influence of vehicle-pavement interaction and parameters of vehicle on pavement damage. To fulfil the aims, this study presents vehicle models, including quarter, half, full vehicle models and quarter vehicle model coupled with pavement, used to compute the dynamic tyre force. The different models are then compared. Two actual road profiles measured by laser, a smooth one and an uneven one, are used for evaluation. The models are analysed to find out the vehicle parameters that influence the road damage most and to learn about how detailed models are needed. It’s found that difference does exist between more detailed models and less detailed ones, and it’s non-negligible. It will increase with the increase of road unevenness. The dynamic tyre force will not be affected much by coupling the pavement, unless the road surface is very uneven or wheel hop exists. On uneven roads, energy mainly dissipates in vehicle suspension. However, on even roads, vibration can be well damped in tyre before it reaches suspension, so most of energy dissipates in tyre. Different components influence the tyre force differently. The influence varies with different frequency range of input signal (road profile) as well. The effects of sprung parts are mainly in low frequency range, while the effects of unsprung parts are mainly in high frequency range. Parameters of vehicle body influence the dynamic tyre force most. The effect of cabin is much smaller compared to vehicle body and unsprung part. Changes in parameters of pavement will not influence the road load, but its resonant frequency. Therefore, the best way to reduce dynamic tyre load is to design a more lightweight vehicle body, softer and better damped suspension...|$|E
40|$|PUBBLICAZIONE PRESENTE IN GOOGLE SCHOLAR CON DUE CITAZIONI. ABSTRACT The {{field of}} {{transportation}} plays {{an essential role}} both {{in the economy and}} the society: a direct relationship between growth of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and tendency of the transport demand can be therefore reasonably stated. First of all, it is quite logical to assume that the economic growth induces person and freight mobility: increasing the production of goods (either in absolute or in added value) means inducing bigger movements of persons (in order to produce and to consume) and visible trades of freight. The second reason is both practical and historical: even if lots of social and economical phenomena are strongly influenced from their initial conditions, a wide-ranging regularity does not completely guarantee an univocal future evolution. In the present case, on the contrary, both an in-depth study of Leontieff’s input-output matrices and the reading of the available data and estimations confirm that the GDP and transport demand have had concordant trends. In other words, the whole economical system was shown to have the “quality” of stability: its floating data population evolves through intermediate states, which can be observed and controlled. In Italy, this procedure was introduced for the first time by Wassily Leontieff and Paolo Costa for the 1986 General Transport Plan (PGT). The method was then nationwide used in various studies, becoming a standard procedure, which often applied the same Leontieff’s evolution ratios (recently, it was expounded again to national level - Iannone, 2003). The same procedure is been used in recent European Union White Paper (2001). This study intends to verify the correlation level between variations in GDP and variations <b>in</b> <b>national</b> <b>traffic</b> flows in Italy also on a regional scale. The values of GDP, from 1980 to 2003, are related to the flows of passenger and freight traffic (passenger-km, tons-km) by rail (source: Trenitalia) and motorway traffic road (source: Italian Association of Motorway and Tunnel Concessionaire Company, AISCAT) over the same period. Having confirmed the substantially linear dependency and the very high index of correlation of the variables, the respective elasticity function is studied and the elasticity index (relation between demand and GDP) for the four flow variables calculated. Our analysis shows an elasticity in excess of 1 for road traffic flows (1. 71 for passenger traffic and 1. 23 for freight traffic) and less than 1 for rail traffic (0. 76 for passenger traffic and 0. 81 for freight traffic). This means that the elasticity of the road traffic system is considerably higher (for every point of growth in GDP we have a 1. 71 growth for passenger traffic and 1. 23 for freight). In contrast with the analysis conducted by Leontieff for PGT of 1986 (for both the road and rail sectors systems), the elasticity of passenger flows is higher than that of freight flows in the road traffic sector (the data of 1986 indicate an elasticity of more than 1 for freight and less than 1 for passengers) ...|$|E

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of SWOV's research programme 2000 - 2001 (Vehicle Safety theme), research was carried out into the safety of delivery vans. Further research into this vehicle type was necessary {{because the number of}} victims of accidents with vans increased by 25 % during the 1991 - 1999 period. In this study the developments which could play a part in this increase were explored. Apart from this, an inventory of the measures already recommended was made. The following subjects were dealt with: (1) results and conclusions of recent, published SWOV research; (2) development of exposure (vehicle numbers and kilometres travelled); (3) development of victims among the occupants of vans and their crash opponents; (4) specific analysis of accident manoeuvres and their course; (5) delivery van measures <b>in</b> the Dutch <b>National</b> <b>Traffic</b> and Transport Plan (NVVP); (6) measures proposed by SWOV; and (7) description of points of attention for policy and research. The "delivery van" name is used for a very heterogeneous group of vehicles such as mini-buses, cars with a so-called 'grey number plate', jeeps/pick-ups, and station cars...|$|R
