40|$|Experiments were {{designed}} to {{study the effects of}} catecholamines on oxytocin responses and milk removal in dairy cows. Adrenalin, noradrenalin, dopamine, isoproterenol (a β-adrenoceptor agonist), phentolamine (an α-adrenergic blocker) and propranolol (a β-adrenergic blocker) were infused intravenously. In addition, adrenalin was infused together with phentolamine and/or propranolol. Infusions started 8 min before milking and lasted until the end of milking. In some cases <b>electroshocks</b> (for 5 s) were applied immediately before milking in the absence and presence of phentolamine and propranolol. Adrenalin, noradrenalin and dopamine reduced milk removal, but only if administered in supraphysiological amounts. The effect of adrenalin and <b>electroshocks</b> on milk removal could be inhibited by α-, but not by β-adrenergic blockade. The effect of dopamine could be inhibited only partly by phentolamine. Inhibition of milk removal was not mediated by reduced oxytocin responses. Enhanced local release of catecholamines from sympathetic nerves was presumably responsible for lowered milk removal in response to <b>electroshocks.</b> Milk removal was facilitated during α-adrenergic blockade and during β-adrenoceptor stimulatio...|$|R
5|$|In 1999, Los Vipers {{split into}} two factions, with Abismo Negro leading a {{splinter}} group called Los Vipers Extreme consisting of <b>Electroshock,</b> Pentagón, Shiima, El Cuervo and Mini Abismo Negro while Cibernético created a group called Los Vipers Primera Clase (First Class Vipers). After less than two months, the angle was dropped and Los Vipers reunited. Not long after Los Vipers reunited, Cibernético formed a group called Lucha Libre Latina (LLL), a group intent on taking over AAA that was inspired by World Championship Wrestling's New World Order. Los Vipers became a subgroup within LLL, and Negro assumed leadership of Los Vipers.

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 I {{compared}} hand sampling, two-pass multiple removal sampling, mark-recapture and catchability-based population {{estimates for}} the Pacific giant salamander (Dicamptodon tenebrosus) at 22 sites in 11 streams of Cascade Mountains of Oregon. Mark-recapture and catchability-based population estimates {{were not significantly different}} (p 0. 86). Hand sampling and two-pass multiple removal population estimates were not significantly different (p = 0. 57). However, mark-recapture and catchability-based estimates were significantly greater than two-pass multiple removal and hand sampling estimates. Hand sampling and multiple removal population estimates were frequently lower than the number of individual Pacific giant salamanders captured by all methods at a site. The catchability of each method differed between streams and within consecutive sites on the same stream. Unacknowledged differences in catchabilities among sites are a potential source of error when using hand-sampling index counts to estimate and compare populations without correcting the {{estimates for the}} differences in Pacific giant salamander catchability. Catchability decreased significantly between the first pass of <b>electroshocking</b> and the subsequent recapture pass of <b>electroshocking.</b> This decrease was observed even though the recapture passes were performed the day after the multiple removal <b>electroshocking.</b> A decrease in catchability violates the assumptions of constant catchability for multiple removal population estimates and potentially explains the weaker performance of removal estimates. Hand sampling estimates did not adjust for the proportion of the population captured at each site, and this is probably the cause of their poor performance. The presumption of constant catchability in hand sampling produced biases in the population estimates, because the catchabilities were not constant. In future studies of stream amphibian abundance, catchability needs to be included in population estimation procedures to produce accurate estimates and to allow valid comparisons of population sizes between sites. Catchability models can be used to calibrate less intensive survey methods, such as hand sampling or a single pass of <b>electroshocking,</b> with the results from more intensive mark-recapture methods. Intensive work would be needed to do the calibrations, but afterwards a standard, more convenient method, such as <b>electroshocking</b> or hand sampling, can be used within the ranges of habitat values for which the calibration model is valid...|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} of his experiments, which took him from the {{psychiatric}} hospital to the abbatoir and the zoologic gardens, Cerletti developed a theory that ECT caused the brain to produce vitalising substances, which he called [...] "agro-agonines" [...] (from the Greek for extreme struggle). He put his theory into practice by injecting patients with a suspension of <b>electroshocked</b> pig brain. Although <b>electroshocked</b> pig brain therapy was used by a few psychiatrists in Italy, France and Brazil it did not become as popular as ECT, which soon replaced metrazol therapy all over the world because it was cheaper, less frightening and more convenient.

50|$|Few data {{exist for}} the {{historical}} distribution of the goldstripe darter, so determining whether the goldstripe has lost any of its former range is difficult.

Once he had an excuse {{to be in their}} rooms, he used an <b>electroshock</b> weapon to immobilise them before killing them by striking their heads with a hammer and cutting them up in their bathrooms. He chose caucasians as his victims because they were vacationing far away from their home countries, which made him less likely to be discovered.

50|$|Gasoline-powered AC electrofishing units {{consisting}} of two hand-held electrodes {{can be used for}} fish capture. The units typically have one of the two electrodes fitted with a 4-mm mesh/nylon net to enable the operator to capture fish, which is usually done in an upstream manner. Sites sampled should be divided into 100 m sections that have block nets placed at the upper and lower ends of the site to restrict immigration and emigration. A stationary seine (4.6 m wide and 1.2 m tall) can be used in conjunction with the <b>electroshocking</b> technique when kept downstream of the individual(s) shocking. A typical sampling crew consists of four people: two seine holders, an <b>electroshocking</b> operator, and a person either kicking into the seine or assisting with the seine in strong flow. When searching for P. sciera, snorkelers, who should never be in the water while electrofishing is underway, begin at the downstream end of the site and slowly proceeded upstream in a random zig-zag direction to observe as much area as possible in expansive shoals, riffles, and runs.|$|R

40|$|Since their {{introduction}} in the 1970 s, Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix {{have spread}} throughout the Mississippi River basin. Management of any species relies on an accurate understanding of population characteristics and dynamics. However, Silver Carp seasonal sampling variation is unknown. Sampling during periods of peak catch rates would facilitate Silver Carp assessment and management, improving monitoring and removal techniques. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate adult Silver Carp seasonal sampling variation with boat <b>electroshocking</b> and trammel nets. Silver Carp were collected monthly (April–October) during 2014 and 2015 from four locations in the Des Moines River, Iowa. Trammel nets rarely captured Silver Carp (mean ± SE = 4. 9 ± 1. 6 fish/net; 60 % of fish were captured in 6. 3 % of net sets) and therefore were not included in analyses. <b>Electroshocking</b> catch rates (CPUEs) exhibited a bimodal distribution, with peak CPUEs generally occurring in May, June, and September and lower catch rates observed during July and August. Catch rates were positively related to river discharge at upstream sites but not at downstream sites. Silver Carp size structure was similar among months and sites except at Cliffland, where fish were smaller during August and October compared to earlier in the year. Finally, Silver Carp condition peaked during April and May and decreased throughout the year except at Keokuk, where peaks were observed during both May and August. Although spatiotemporal variability was substantial, these results suggest that sampling of Silver Carp via <b>electroshocking</b> in May–June and September–October generally produces higher catch rates compared to July–August sampling and generates a more representative size structure. Using site-specific knowledge, monitoring and surveillance programs could more effectively sample during these periods of high vulnerability and densities in order to manage the spread and impacts of Silver Carp at statewide and regionwide scales...|$|R

5|$|Negro {{became one}} of the driving forces in LLL's feud with AAA owner Antonio Peña and his AAA loyalists. Over the years, Negro feuded with the top técnicos of AAA such as La Parka, Jr., Octagón and Latin Lover. Negro's {{position}} as one of AAA's top workers was cemented on March 5, 2000, when he competed in AAA's annual Rey de Reyes tournament. In the opening round, he defeated Dos Caras, Killer and Psicosis II and in the finals, he defeated El Alebrije, Charly Manson and Cibernético to win the 2000 Rey de Reyes tournament. Negro's status as a main eventer caused storyline problems between LLL's leader Cibernético and Abismo Negro, leading to a series of matches between the two to see who should lead Los Vipers. On September 29, 2000, Negro defeated Cibernético in a one on one match at Verano de Escandalo (2000). When the two faced off in a steel cage match at Guerra de Titanes (2000), the match ended without a winner, after which the rivalry between the leader and the deputy leader was put on the back burner. In 2001, Negro almost won Rey de Reyes again, but La Parka, Jr. defeated him in the finals.

40|$|Investigating the {{physiological}} state of wild salmonids is challenging on many levels. The sensitive nature {{of an integrated}} physiological stress response directs how biological data is collected in the field and, consequently, how the results are interpreted. This thesis is comprised of two main components. The first component encompasses laboratory-based studies addressing the potential confounding effects of: 1) anaesthesia with either tricaine methanesulphonate (tricaine) or clove oil (eugenol) prior to blood/tissue sampling, and 2) capture by <b>electroshocking,</b> on the immediate and short-term responses of plasma/serum cortisol and glucose concentrations, haematocrit, plasma/serum lysozyme activity, and total leucocyte abundance in juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). The second component involves a field-based exploration of the in situ physiological status, using the same five physiological traits, of wild bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) in the Torpy River watershed, B. C., in relation to selected habitat attributes (stream gradient, discharge rate, and riparian canopy-closure). Anaesthetization and <b>electroshocking</b> did not significantly alter values for the five physiological traits provided that post-capture blood sampling occurred immediately. Tricaine and clove oil immobilization produced similar effects on {{the physiological}} stress response of juvenile chinook salmon. Clove oil (eugenol) shows promise as a viable and safe alternative to tricaine for aquacultural purposes and in laboratory- and field-based research. <b>Electroshocking</b> is an acute stressor from which juvenile chinook salmon can recover physiologically (usually within 12 - 24 h). Handling without shocking, however, significantly reduced serum lysozyme activity for up to 2 wks post-stress. Radiographs indicated that while some degree of spinal abnormality exists naturally in domestic chinook juveniles, individuals exposed to a single brief shock incur significantly more spinal deformities. Some {{of the variation in}} the stress physiology and non-specific immune function of wild bull trout in the Torpy River system were explained by the combined effects of stream gradient, discharge rate, and riparian canopy-closure. The physiological measurements of wild bull trout generally did not differ from those reported in the literature for other salmonid species. The "background" effects of these habitat features on the physiology of wild salmonids must be considered when interpreting field-collected data.
