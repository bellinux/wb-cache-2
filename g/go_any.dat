5|$|At {{the end of}} the day, man, I'm just tired, and old, and bald, and fat, and grouchy, and bored. You know? So I {{was just}} like, I'm going to make this record, and do this stupid Ozzfest thing, and tell a bunch of stupid jokes in front {{of a lot of people}} at Download, then I'm just going to fuck off for a while. The bigger this gets, the less I care, to the point where I just need to go spend some time with my family. I don't wanna bastardise Strapping and all these other {{projects}} by doing it for the money. Strapping was about the big middle finger, and it still is, but I don't think it needs to <b>go</b> <b>any</b> further than this.|$|E

After chasing down and killing Robert, a former accomplice who stole their merchandise, Tess and Joel are offered their merchandise back from Robert's buyer Marlene if {{they agree to}} help smuggle Ellie to the State Capitol building outside of the Quarantine Zone with Joel. She and Joel successfully {{make it to the}} Capitol building, only to discover upon arrival that the people they are meant to rendezvous with are all dead.

As soldiers arrive at the building, Tess orders Joel, as a last obligation to her, to find Tommy and get Ellie to the Fireflies, before sending them off while she covers them. Tess is then killed in the subsequent gunfight, ensuring she never turns.|$|E

He later looks after Vanessa Villante (Alin Sumarwata) when she is brought in with severe morning sickness. Vanessa learns Rhys has been talking about her with his friends and she tells him to stay out of her business. Rhys later helps Vanessa carry some boxes and he spends the day baking a cake with her. He buys her a new mixer and Vanessa invites him to dinner. Rhys gives the cake to Elaine and when he tells her about Vanessa, she warns him to think about what he is doing before letting it <b>go</b> <b>any</b> further.

5|$|They found {{albatross}} chicks {{and seals}} to eat, {{but despite the}} relative comfort of the island compared to the small boat, they still urgently needed to reach the whaling station at Husvik {{on the other side}} of the island to fetch help for the men on Elephant Island. It was clear that McNish and Vincent could not continue, so Shackleton left them in the care of Timothy McCarthy camped in the upturned James Caird, and with Worsley and Crean made the hazardous trip over the mountains. McNish took screws from the James Caird and attached them to the boots of the men making the journey to help them grip the ice. He also fashioned a crude sledge from driftwood he found on the beach, but it proved too clumsy to be practical. When Shackleton's party set off on 18 May 1916, McNish accompanied them for a few hundred yards but he was unable to <b>go</b> <b>any</b> further. He shook hands with each of the men, wished them good luck and then Shackleton sent him back. Putting McNish in command of the remaining men, Shackleton charged him to wait for relief and if none had come by the end of winter to attempt to sail to the east coast. Once Shackleton's party had crossed the mountains and arrived in Husvik, he sent Worsley with one of the whaler's ships, Samson, to pick up McNish and the other men. After seeing the emaciated and drawn McNish on his arrival at the whaling station, Shackleton recorded that he felt that the rescue had come just in time for him.|$|E
25|$|In May 1929, the American E. F. Farmer left Darjeeling {{with native}} porters, crossed the Kang La into Nepal {{and climbed up}} towards the Talung Saddle.

25|$|On Sunday, August 22, {{no other}} sign of Ben had been found. A text message {{was sent to}} Edd Sorenson, a veteran cave diver and {{recovery}} specialist with hundreds of dives to his credit, on his yacht in the Bahamas, where he was leading an expedition. He came to Vortex Springs the next day.

25|$|At {{the end of}} the Civil War the {{communities}} west of Long Prairie were settled by Southern soldiers who had fought for the Union Army that were not very welcome in their home state of Kentucky. Once located at the present intersection of County Roads 38 and 11, Whiteville was settled by the three White sisters and their families. Clotho was settled where it is because, it seems, settlers couldn't <b>go</b> <b>any</b> further given that the forests and swamps to the west were impenetrable.|$|E
25|$|Sailing {{from the}} Indian Ocean to the Bahamas was a journey {{halfway around the}} world, and the Fancy was forced to stop along the way at Ascension Island, located {{in the middle of}} the Atlantic. The barren island was uninhabited, but the men were able to catch fifty of the sea turtles that crawled ashore to lay their eggs on the beach, {{providing}} them enough food for the rest of the voyage. However, about seventeen of the Every's crew refused to <b>go</b> <b>any</b> further and were left behind on the island.|$|E
25|$|The party then {{faced the}} ordeal of rowing back up the Murray and Murrumbidgee, against the current, {{in the heat of}} an Australian summer. Their {{supplies}} ran out and when they reached the site of Narrandera in April they were unable to <b>go</b> <b>any</b> further. Sturt sent two men overland in search of supplies and they returned in time to save the party from starvation, but Sturt went blind for some months and never fully recovered his health. By the time they arrived back in Sydney they had rowed and sailed nearly 2,900 kilometres of the river system.|$|E

25|$|Takeda is {{a classmate}} {{and friend of}} Hotaru, and is Yuma's first boyfriend. In the story he {{comes across as a}} {{friendly}} understanding guy who is aware of his girlfriend's shyness, and does his best to remedy the situation. He is unaware of Hotaru's advances towards Yuma, but later senses that she doesn't hold enough affection for him. Takeda eventually ends their dating relationship and tells Yuma to find out what she wants for herself before they <b>go</b> <b>any</b> further. The two remain friends until he starts to worry that Yuma may be in trouble with another person at Fujiwara's suggestion. He asks Yuma (who is crying) out again {{at the end of the}} fifth manga volume not knowing that she was just rejected by Hotaru.|$|E
25|$|Franklin's party reached Fort Enterprise on 12 October 1821, {{two days}} after Back. They found it deserted and unstocked. The promised {{supplies}} of dried meat had not appeared, {{and there was nothing}} to eat except bones from the previous winter, a few rotting skins which had been used as bedding, and a little tripe de roche. A note from Back explained that he had found the fort in this state, and that he was heading towards Fort Providence to look for Akaitcho and his first nation members. The party despaired. Two voyageurs, Augustus and Benoit, set off upriver in the hope of meeting some first nation people. The rest of the group remained, too weak to <b>go</b> <b>any</b> further. Two of the voyageurs lay down crying and waited to die, and even the normally optimistic Franklin wrote of how quickly his strength was evaporating. None of them had eaten meat for four weeks.|$|E
25|$|Cameron {{arrives in}} Salem in April 2012 and bumps into Abigail Deveraux who helps him track down his half-sister, Lexie Carver at the hospital. Cameron is {{shocked to learn}} that Lexie has an {{inoperable}} brain tumor. Cameron and Abby bump into one another again when he is working {{the bar at the}} Brady pub; he explains that he sometimes helps out when they are short staffed; as Cameron and Abby tease one another, they develop an attraction. Lexie's other half-brother, Chad DiMera and his girlfriend, Melanie decide to show Cameron around and he ends up on a double date with Abby where he saves her from choking on popcorn. Meanwhile, Lexie's health continues declining and Cameron promises {{to spend more time with}} his nephew Theo before and after Lexie is gone. Celeste notices the growing closeness between Cameron and Abby, and warns Cameron that she will only cause him trouble. Despite Celeste's warnings, the two begin seeing each other and share their first kiss in late May 2012. In June 2012, Abby comforts Cameron when Lexie passes away, much to Celeste's dismay. Instead of going back home, Cameron chooses to relocate to Salem permanently, mainly to stay close Theo and Abby, despite Celeste warning him against getting involved with her. However, Abby is afraid to get too serious with Cameron believing he will eventually leave town. In early July, Cameron assures her that he is staying in Salem for several reasons, but mainly so they can be together. Cameron supports Abby when her father Jack suddenly dies. During her grief, Abby struggles with her emotions and has trouble being intimate with him. Realizing Abby needs to get help before their relationship can <b>go</b> <b>any</b> further, Cameron breaks up with her. During the holidays, Cameron and Chad bond over their memories of Lexie. Cameron later rekindles his relationship with Abby but when she admits to him that she has feelings for her ex Chad, he gives her time to choose between them, just as they both compete for Abigail's affection. On 9 August 2013, after doing a test on Chad, Cameron finds out that Chad has a brain tumor, he requests Cameron to keep it a secret, to which he agrees. Just as Abigail makes up her choice and is about to choose Cameron, he breaks things off with her and pushes her to Chad's arms.|$|E

That was such an appalling vista that every sensible person would say, [...] "It cannot be right that these actions should <b>go</b> <b>any</b> further." ...|$|E
500|$|Merrick {{arrived in}} London and into Norman's care. Norman, {{initially}} shocked by Merrick's appearance and reluctant to display him, nonetheless exhibited {{him at his}} penny gaff shop at 123 Whitechapel Road, directly {{across the road from}} the London Hospital. Because of its proximity to the hospital, the shop received medical students and doctors as visitors. One of these was the surgeon Frederick Treves who arranged to have Merrick brought into the hospital to be examined. According to Norman's autobiography, Merrick went to the hospital [...] "two or three" [...] times, but then refused to <b>go</b> <b>any</b> more, as the examinations made him feel [...] "like an animal in a cattle market".|$|E

500|$|In 2010, Halden Prison was shortlisted for the World Architecture Festival Awards, and its {{interior}} design earned the Arnstein Arneberg Award.

That same year, another film on Halden Prison was produced: The Norden, a television film produced by Finnish Broadcasting Company, explored the reactions of James Conway, a former superintendent at New York's Attica Correctional Facility, during a prison tour.
