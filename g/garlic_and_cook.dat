40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{experiment}} is to observe the antibacterial properties of <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> uncooked crushed <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> the differences between <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> uncooked crushed <b>garlic.</b> My research question was : “ Is there a significant mean difference between <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> uncooked crushed <b>garlic</b> depending on the antibacterial effects. ” A significant mean difference between <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> uncooked <b>garlic</b> is expected {{as a result of}} {{this experiment}}. According to the antibacterial characteristics, the most efficient one will be the uncooked crushed garlic. On the other hand, the cooked crushed garlic will not have a significant bactericidal characteristic. The Kirby-Bauer antibacterial testing method was prefered to conduct this experiment so as to test the hypothesis and to find the suitable answer for the research question. In laboratory conditions, incubation of Escherichia coli population was applied on Mueller-Hinton II agar plate. Filter paper disks were put onto the agar after being soaked in <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> uncooked crushed <b>garlic.</b> The growth inhibition zone diameters were measured and by these diameters data analysis was done in order to investigate the differences between antibacterial characteristics of <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> uncooked <b>garlic.</b> As a result, the filter paper disk soaked in uncooked crushed garlic had the largest diameter of the growth inhibition zone. In contrast, cooked crushed garlic had nearly no significant growth inhibition zone around the filter paper disk. Results of T-test statistics showed that uncooked crushed <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooked</b> crushed <b>garlic</b> had <b>and</b> important maen differences in terms of their antibacterial effect on the tested microorganism named Escherichia coli, which is Gram negative bacteria...|$|R
