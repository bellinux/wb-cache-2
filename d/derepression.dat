5|$|In plants, {{signaling}} by auxins, or phytohormones {{that order}} {{the direction and}} tropism of plant growth, induces the targeting of a class of transcription factor repressors known as Aux/IAA proteins for proteasomal degradation. These proteins are ubiquitinated by SCFTIR1, or SCF in complex with the auxin receptor TIR1. Degradation of Aux/IAA proteins derepresses transcription factors in the auxin-response factor (ARF) family and induces ARF-directed gene expression. The cellular consequences of ARF activation depend on the plant type and developmental stage, but are involved in directing growth in roots and leaf veins. The specific response to ARF <b>derepression</b> {{is thought to be}} mediated by specificity in the pairing of individual ARF and Aux/IAA proteins.|$|E
50|$|A {{knockout}} {{model for}} MAEL, the mammalian homolog of Drosophila’s Maelstrom, {{was created by}} homologous recombination in mice to create Mael null mice. In the knockout mice, meiotic chromosome synapsis is defective. In addition, spermatogenesis fails due to sperm DNA damage caused by the <b>derepression</b> of transposable elements.|$|E
50|$|In {{genetics}} and biochemistry, a repressor gene inhibits {{the activity of}} an operator gene. Removal of repression, such as of an operon so that gene transcription occurs or is enhanced, with the net result frequently being elevation {{of the level of}} a specific enzyme. This effect is called <b>derepression.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{geriatric}} mice, resting satellite cells lose reversible quiescence {{by switching}} to an irreversible pre-senescence state, caused by <b>derepression</b> of p16INK4a (also called Cdkn2a). On injury, these cells fail to activate and expand, {{even in a}} youthful environment. p16INK4a silencing in geriatric satellite cells restores quiescence and muscle regenerative functions.|$|E
50|$|Qrr {{operates}} {{as part of}} a negative feedback loop which regulates the shift in cell state from that of low density populations to that in high density populations. In Vibrio harveyi, Qrr binds and represses expression of the luxR mRNA transcript, a master regulator of quorum-sensing genes. At higher population densities, increased autoinducer concentration leads to termination of qrr transcription hence <b>derepression</b> of luxR.|$|E
5000|$|Gli3 is a known {{transcriptional}} repressor but {{may also}} have a positive transcriptional function. [...] Gli3 represses dHand and Gremlin, which are involved in developing digits. [...] There is evidence that Shh-controlled processing (e.g., cleavage) regulates transcriptional activity of Gli3 similarly to that of Ci. [...] Gli3 mutant mice have many abnormalities including CNS and lung defects and limb polydactyly. [...] In the developing mouse limb bud, Gli3 <b>derepression</b> predominately regulates Shh target genes.|$|E
5000|$|Activation {{of three}} major {{hydrogen}} peroxide-dependent pathways, EGF, FOXO1, and IKK-α occur during injury-induced epidermal keratinocyte migration, adhesion, cytoprotection and wound healing. [...] IKKα regulates human keratinocyte migration by surveillance of the redox environment after wounding. IKK-α is [...] at a conserved cysteine residue in the kinase domain, which correlated with <b>derepression</b> of EGF promoter activity and increased EGF expression, indicating that IKK-α stimulatea migration through dynamic {{interactions with the}} EGF promoter depending on the redox state within cells.|$|E
50|$|Highly Up-regulated in {{liver cancer}} (HULC) {{is one of}} the most {{upregulated}} of all genes in hepatocellular carcinoma. CREB (cAMP response element binding protein) has been implicated in the upregulation of HULC. HULC RNA inhibits miR-372 activity through a ceRNA function, leading to <b>derepression</b> of one of its target genes, PRKACB, which can then induce the phosphorylation and activation of CREB. Overall, HULC lncRNA is part of a self-amplifying autoregulatory loop in which it sponges miR-372 to activate CREB, and in turn upregulates its own expression levels.|$|E
50|$|Other {{systems such}} as the T-REx system by Life Technologies work in a {{different}} fashion. The gene of interest is flanked by an upstream CMV promoter and two TetO2 sites. Expression of the gene of interest is repressed by the high affinity binding of TetR homodimers to each TetO2 sequences {{in the absence of}} tetracycline. Introduction of tetracycline results in binding of one tetracycline on each TetR homodimer followed by release of TetO2 by the TetR homodimers. Unbinding of TetR homodimers and TetO2 result in <b>derepression</b> of the gene of interest.|$|E
50|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} {{belongs to the}} lin-28 family, which is {{characterized}} by the presence of a cold-shock domain and a pair of CCHC zinc finger domains. This gene is highly expressed in testis, fetal liver, placenta, and in primary human tumors and cancer cell lines. It is negatively regulated by microRNAs that target sites in the 3' UTR, and overexpression of this gene in primary tumors is linked to the repression of let-7 family of microRNAs and <b>derepression</b> of let-7 targets, which facilitates cellular transformation.|$|E
50|$|Acetylation {{occurs on}} the lysine {{residues}} {{found at the}} amino N-terminal of histone tails. Histone acetylation is most commonly associated with relaxed chromatin, transcriptional <b>derepression,</b> and thus actively transcribed genes (Bradley et al., 2007). Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) are enzymes responsible for the addition of acetyl groups, and histone deacetylases (HDACs) are enzymes responsible {{for the removal of}} acetyl groups. Therefore, the addition or removal of an acetyl group to a histone can alter the expression of nearby genes. The majority of drugs being investigated are inhibitors of proteins that remove acetyl from histones or histone deacetylases (HDACs).|$|E
5000|$|T. reesei is an {{important}} commercial and industrial micro-organism due to its cellulase production ability. Many strains of T. reesei have been developed since its discovery, with heavy emphasis on increasing cellulase production. These [...] "improvement programs" [...] originally consisted of classical (ionising-radiation-based and chemical-based) mutagenesis, which led to strains capable of producing 20 times as much cellulase as the QM6a isolate. The ultimate aim {{in the creation of}} hypercellulolytic strains was to obtain a carbon catabolite derepressed strain. This <b>derepression</b> would allow the T. reesei strain to produce cellulases under any set of growth conditions, even in the presence of glucose.|$|E

50|$|LexA {{protein is}} the {{repressor}} of all cellular din genes. Lesions such as single-stranded DNA, depurinic and depytimidinic sites or even free deoxynucletoides seem to activate RecA to LexA processing form that facilitates cleavage of LexA repressor, thus leading to <b>derepression</b> of all din genes. RecA protein {{appears to have}} further roles in the mutagenic process: first it facilitates cleavage of UmuD protein, thereby generating a mutagenically active form (UmuD’). Due to {{the participation of the}} umuC in the mutagenic process leading to both point- and frameshift-mutations, only one single bacterial strain is necessary to detect different types of mutagens. Nevertheless, additional strains have been developed in order to increase sensitivity for the detection of genotoxins, belonging to certain classes, such as nitroarenes.|$|E
50|$|At the {{individual}} gene level, Rao et al. have reported hypomethylation and thus <b>derepression</b> of COX-2, inhibition of which reduces inflammation and pain, and hypermethylation of BDNF, a neurotrophic factor important for long-term memory. Expression of CREB, an activity-dependent transcription factor involved in regulating BDNF {{among many other}} genes, {{has also been shown}} to be hypermethylated, and thus repressed, in AD brains, further reducing BDNF transcription (Rao et al., 2012). Furthermore, synaptophysin (SYP), the major synaptic vesicle protein-encoding gene, {{has been shown to be}} hypermethylated and thus repressed, and transcription factor NF-κB, which is involved in immune signaling, has been shown to be hypomethylated and thus derepressed (Rao et al., 2012). Taken together, these results have elucidated a role for dysregulation of genes involved in learning and memory and synaptic transmission, as well as with immune response.|$|E
50|$|Gain-of-function H3K27M {{mutations}} in protein histone H3 lead to inactivation of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) methyltransferase {{and result in}} global hypomethylation of H3K27me3 and transcriptional <b>derepression</b> of potential oncogenes. About 40% of these mutation are associated with gain of function or amplifications {{mutations in}} the PDGFRA gene in cases of pediatric diffuse Gliomas of the pons. It appears that the initial histone H3 mutations alone are insufficient but rather require cooperating secondary mutations such as PDGFRA-activating mutations or PDGFRA amplifications to develop this type of brain tumor. In a small non-randomized trial study, imatinib therapy in patients with glioblastoma {{selected on the basis}} of having imatinib-inhibitable tyrosine kinases in biopsy tissue caused marginal disease improvement compared to similar treatment of patients with unselected recurrent glioblastoma. This suggests that patient sub-populations with excessive PDGFRA-related or other tyrosine kinase-related over-activity might benefit from imatinib therapy. Several phase I and Phase II clinical glioma/glioblastoma studies have been conducted using imatinib but no decisive follow-up phase III studies have been reported.|$|E
5000|$|This leader {{sequence}} {{is very important}} for the regulation of histidine in [...] "E. coli". The his operon operates under a system of coordinated regulation where all the gene products will be repressed or depressed equally. The main factor in the repression or <b>derepression</b> of histidine synthesis is the concentration of histidine charged tRNAs. The regulation of histidine is actually quite simple considering the complexity of its biosynthesis pathway and, it closely resembles regulation of tryptophan. In this system the full {{leader sequence}} has 4 blocks of complementary strands that can form hairpin loops structures. Block one, shown above, is the key to regulation. When histidine charged tRNA levels are low in the cell the ribosome will stall at the string of His residues in block 1. This stalling of the ribosome will allow complementary strands 2 and 3 to form a hairpin loop. The loop formed by strands 2 and 3 forms an anti-terminator and translation of the his genes will continue and histidine will be produced. However, when histidine charged tRNA levels are high the ribosome will not stall at block 1, this will not allow strands 2 and 3 to form a hairpin. Instead strands 3 and 4 will form a hairpin loop further downstream of the ribosome. The hairpin loop formed by strands 3 and 4 is a terminating loop, when the ribosome comes into contact with the loop, it will be “knocked off” the transcript. When the ribosome is removed the his genes will not be translated and histidine will not be produced by the cell.|$|E
50|$|Oncogenes are {{genes that}} can cause cancer when they are mutated or if they have {{drastically}} abnormal expression levels. PcG proteins {{have been found to}} associate with such genes, serving to either directly or indirectly alter their levels of expression through epigenetic modifications. c-Myc is a canonical oncogene that has been shown to associate with members of the PcG proteins. Normally, c-Myc is highly expressed in immature cells but has almost no perceivable expression in mature/differentiated cells. Its roles in the cell cycle and apoptosis help cells maintain an immature state, and its expression wanes as cells begin to differentiate. Bmi-1 and Myc were found to be partners within the cell nucleus. Interestingly, Bmi-1 and c-Myc seem to function in tandem in multiple ways. Studies have found that together c-Myc and Bmi-1 possess the ability to alter tumor suppressor genes. Hypoactive c-Myc was shown to alter p16 via Bmi-1, while hyperactive c-Myc was capable of altering the p16 promoter itself 28. Normally, p16 functions to prevent cells from progressing through the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle too quickly. Altering this function helps drive cells to proliferate uncontrollably making them more tumorigenic in nature. Hence, these data present a model in which c-Myc and Bmi-1 alter cellular apoptosis via cell cycle regulator genes. Conversely, another protein has been shown to alter Bmi-1 {{in such a way that}} negates its association with c-Myc and ultimately reduces its tumorigenic capacity. Researchers found that Akt phosphorylate Bmi-1 at Serine 316 (Ser316), thus inhibiting its chromatin-modifying function, suppressing its growth-promoting potential, promoting the <b>derepression</b> of the Ink4a-Arf locus, and decreasing cellular transformation activities with c-Myc.|$|E
50|$|Two {{recent studies}} by Bosson et al. (2014) and Denzler et al. (2014) have empirically {{assessed}} the ceRNA hypothesis by quantifying the number MREs {{that must be}} added to detect ceRNA-mediated gene regulation. Both studies agree that determining the number of transcriptomic miRNA-binding sites is crucial for evaluating the potential for ceRNA regulation and that miRNA binding sites are generally higher {{than the number of}} miRNA molecules. However, they differ in two aspects: (1) the experimental approaches used to determine the number of ‘‘effective’’ transcriptomic miRNA-binding sites and (2) the impact miRNA concentrations have on the number of binding sites that must be added to detect target gene <b>derepression.</b> The discrepancies between these studies lead to different conclusions with respect to the likelihood of observing ceRNA effects in natural settings, with Bosson et al. observing a ceRNA effect at physiologically plausible and Denzler et al. at unphysiological competitor levels. In an updated study, Denzler et al. (2016) has revisited the discrepancies between the two studies and has shown that while miRNA levels define the extent of repression, they have little effect on the number of binding sites that need to be added to observe ceRNA-mediated regulation. Using the same cells and experimental systems as the two studies they suggested that the number of binding sites are very high and better reflects the estimates of the study by Denzler et al. (2014), and that low-affinity/background miRNA sites (such as 6-nt sites, offset 6-nt sites, non-canonical sites) significantly contribute to competition. Due to this large number of background sites, their model suggests that prospects of observing an effect from a ceRNA are greatly reduced.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies in}} this and other {{laboratories}} have shown that <b>derepression</b> of beta-lactamases in strains of Enterobacter and Pseudomonas spp. {{is responsible for the}} rapid development of resistance to a variety of beta-lactam antibiotics. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effects of clindamycin on <b>derepression</b> of beta-lactamases in these two genera. In tests with four strains of each genus, clindamycin diminished <b>derepression</b> in one isolate of each genus and completely prevented <b>derepression</b> in a second Enterobacter isolate (strain 55). Additional tests with strain 55 revealed that other inhibitors of macromolecular synthesis did not completely prevent <b>derepression</b> of beta-lactamase when tested at concentrations that did not inhibit replication. However, clindamycin did not affect synthesis of beta-lactamase that was constitutively produced in a mutant of this strain (55 M). It also did not inhibit <b>derepression</b> of beta-galactosidase in either strain 55 or 55 M. Clindamycin did not diminish the bactericidal effects of beta-lactam antibiotics against Enterobacter or Pseudomonas spp. However, it enhanced the bactericidal activity of cefamandole against strain 55. These in vitro effects of clindamycin on strain 55 that were related to prevention of <b>derepression</b> of beta-lactamase were confirmed in vivo with an animal model of infection. These results indicate that in some strains, clindamycin can specifically prevent <b>derepression</b> of beta-lactamases without inhibiting growth. Such a selective effect may provide a new approach for the enhancement of the antibacterial activity of certain beta-lactam antibiotics...|$|E
40|$|Rhizobitoxine {{produced}} by Bradyrhizobium species strongly prevented <b>derepression</b> of hydrogenase expression in free-living Bradyrhizobium japonicum, although the toxin {{had no effect}} on the activity of cells which had already synthesized hydrogenase protein. Dihydrorhizobitoxine, a structural analog of rhizobitoxine, proved to be a less potent inhibitor of hydrogenase <b>derepression.</b> Rhizobitoxine did not cause cell death at a concentration sufficient to eliminate hydrogenase expression. The large subunit of hydrogenase was not detectable with antibody after <b>derepression</b> in the presence of rhizobitoxine. The general pattern of proteins synthesized from 14 C-labeled amino acids during <b>derepression</b> was not significantly different in {{the presence or absence of}} rhizobitoxine. These results indicated that rhizobitoxine inhibited hydrogenase synthesis in free-living B. japonicum. Cystathionine and methionine strongly prevented the inhibition of hydrogenase <b>derepression</b> by rhizobitoxine, suggesting that the inhibition involves the level of sulfur-containing amino acids in the cell...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of the five tryptophan biosynthetic enzymes of Neurospora crassa was shown to be derepressed in histidine-starved cells. This histidine-mediated <b>derepression</b> was not due to a lowered intracellular concentration of tryptophan in these cells. Furthermore, histidine-mediated <b>derepression</b> of tryptophan enzymes {{was found to be}} coordinate and not subject to reversal by tryptophan of either exogenous or biosynthetic origin. The synthesis of tryptophan enzymes also was found to be coordinate in cells which were not histidine-starved. Although histidine is clearly involved in regulating the synthesis of tryptophan enzymes, it did not prevent either tryptophan-mediated <b>derepression</b> of tryptophan enzymes or indole- 3 -glycerol phosphate-mediated <b>derepression</b> of tryptophan synthetase...|$|E
40|$|<b>Derepression</b> of an uptake {{hydrogenase}} in Bradyrhizobium japonicum {{is dependent}} on a microaerophilic environment. Addition of DNA gyrase inhibitors during depression of hydrogenase specifically prevented expression of the hydrogenase enzyme. Antibodies to individual hydrogenase subunits failed to detect the protein after <b>derepression</b> {{in the presence of}} inhibitors, although there was no general inhibition of protein synthesis. The general pattern of proteins synthesized from 14 C-labeled amino acids during <b>derepression</b> was not significantly different whether proteins were labeled in the presence or in the absence of gyrase inhibitors. In contrast, if transcription or translation was inhibited by addition of inhibitors of those functions, virtually no proteins were labeled during <b>derepression.</b> This indicated that most of the 14 C-labeled proteins were synthesized de novo during <b>derepression,</b> synthesis of most proteins was unaffected by gyrase inhibitors, and the dependence of hydrogenase synthesis on gyrase activity was a specific one...|$|E
40|$|The catabolic, NAD-specific {{glutamate}} dehydrogenase (NAD-GDH) of Neurospora crassa is under carbon catabolite repression. Cells grown on a glycolytic carbon source, such as sucrose, have low basal levels of enzyme activity. Treatment of repressed cells with either polymyxin B or amphotericin B resulted in <b>derepression</b> of NAD-GDH. <b>Derepression</b> {{at the transcriptional level}} occurred very rapidly (within 30 min) {{in response to}} polymyxin B addition but reached a plateau within 2 h. Amphotericin B-induced <b>derepression</b> initiated more slowly but continued for at least 6 h, resulting in a specific activity comparable to that seen with cells transferred to glutamate as the sole carbon source. These antibiotics had no significant effect upon the activities of two constitutive enzymes, pyruvate kinase and malate dehydrogenase. Curiously, only polymyxin B treatment derepressed invertase, another catabolite-repressed enzyme. The addition of 100 mM KCl to the growth medium blocked <b>derepression</b> by both antibiotics, but the addition of 50 mM MgCl 2 only annulled <b>derepression</b> by polymyxin B. The ergosterol-deficient erg- 1 mutant, which is resistant to amphotericin B, did not derepress NAD-GDH when treated with this drug. These results are consistent with <b>derepression</b> resulting from interactions of these antibiotics with the plasma membrane...|$|E

40|$|A {{decrease}} in the in vivo acylation level of methionine transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNAmet) induced by methioninyl adenylate led to a specific <b>derepression</b> of methionyl-transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) synthetase formation. This <b>derepression</b> required de novo protein synthesis and was reflected by overproduction of unaltered enzyme. Two different strains of Escherichia coli K- 12 that have normal levels of methionyl-tRNA synthetase were examined and the <b>derepression</b> of methionyl-tRNA synthetase was observed in both. Moreover, {{for one of these}} strains, the relation between the level of methionyl-tRNA synthetase and deacylation level of tRNAmet was established; under the growth conditions used, when more than 25 % of tRNAmet was deacylated, methionyl-tRNA synthetase formation was derepressed and the level of <b>derepression</b> became proportional to the amount of tRNAmet deacylated. Concomitantly, the enzyme was subject to specific inactivation as a consequence of which the true de novo rate of <b>derepression</b> of the formation of this enzyme was higher than that determined by measurements of enzyme activity. These studies were extended to strains AB 311 and ed 2, which had a constitutive enhanced level of methionyl-tRNA synthetase. In these strains no <b>derepression</b> of enzyme formation was observed on reducing the acylation level of tRNAmet by use of methioninyl adenylate...|$|E

Any starvation condition was sufficient to trigger an initial high mRNA elevation; however, it was the severity of starvation which determined the steady-state mRNA levels that were subsequently established. The products of the positive regulatory genes AAS 101, AAS 103, and AAS 2 were shown to be required in the initiation phase of this response, whereas the AAS 102 gene product was required to maintain the new elevated steady-state mRNA levels.

40|$|Asf 1 is a conserved histone H 3 /H 4 chaperone. We {{find that}} Asf 1 in budding yeast {{promotes}} an essential cellular response to replication stress {{caused by the}} ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea.

Having identified the C terminus and histone-binding domains of Asf 1 as molecular determinants of its constitutive and inducible association with chromatin, we tested whether Asf 1 binding to DDR genes is mechanistically important for their <b>derepression.</b> Our results provide little support for this hypothesis. Rather, the contribution of Asf 1 to DDR gene <b>derepression</b> depends {{on its ability to}} stimulate H 3 K 56 acetylation by lysine acetyltransferase Rtt 109. The precise regulation of H 3 K 56 acetylation in the promoters of DDR genes is unexpected: DDR gene promoters are occupied by H 3 K 56 -acetylated nucleosomes under repressing conditions, and the steady state level of H 3 K 56 promoter acetylation does not change upon <b>derepression.</b> We propose that replication-coupled deposition of Lys 56 -acetylated H 3 poises the DDR genes in newly synthesized daughter duplexes for <b>derepression</b> during the S phase.

Both of these anions derepress ATP sulfurylase in cells growing on sulfate, {{but not in}} cells growing on L-cysteine. However, the two anions appear to derepress by different mechanisms. Molybdate caused <b>derepression</b> only at concentrations that were in excess over sulfate and were sufficient to inhibit growth and protein accumulation, indicating that the <b>derepression</b> resulted from sulfur starvation. Selenate caused <b>derepression</b> at one-tenth the concentration of sulfate, a concentration of selenate that was subtoxic, while toxic levels of selenate produced far less <b>derepression.</b> The susceptibility of the tobacco cells to selenate toxicity was high under conditions of sulfur nutrition that derepress ATP sulfurylase, and low under conditions that repress ATP sulfurylase, {{in agreement with the}} idea that selenate acts via a functional sulfate assimilation pathway. Since it is known that selenate is incorporated into analogs of sulfur compounds, it is proposed that the tobacco cells synthesize the seleno-analog of the end product of the sulfate pathway responsible for repression, and the seleno-analog antagonizes the normal end product in the repression mechanism, the net result being <b>derepression</b> of ATP sulfurylase by selenate...|$|E

The Celf 1 RNA-binding protein targets bound mRNAs {{for rapid}} degradation, and antisense approaches demonstrated that segmentation defects in celf 1 morphants {{were due to}} a <b>derepression</b> of rbpj mRNA. Rbpj protein is a key player of Notch signalling. Because segmentation involves complex cross-talk between several signalling pathways, we analysed how rbpj <b>derepression</b> impacted these pathways. We found that rbpj <b>derepression</b> stimulated the Notch pathway. Notch positively controlled the expression of cyp 26 a, which encodes a retinoic acid (RA) -degrading enzyme. Thus, rbpj <b>derepression</b> led to cyp 26 a overexpression and RA attenuation. It also repressed fgf 8, consistent with an inhibition of FGF signalling. Pharmacological inhibition of the FGF pathway repressed cyp 26 a, but rbpj <b>derepression</b> was sufficient to restore cyp 26 a expression. Hence, while it was known that the FGF pathway antagonized RA signalling through expression of cyp 26 a, our results suggest that Rbpj mediates this antagonism. Furthermore, they show that the post-transcriptional repression exerted by Celf 1 on rbpj mRNA is required to keep cyp 26 a expression {{under the control of}} FGF signalling.
