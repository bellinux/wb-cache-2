40|$|The {{dominant}} discourse {{concerned with}} the impact of being a mother on a woman’s professional career usually draws upon the language of limitations, constraints and glass ceilings. Motherhood is usually considered to inhibit a woman's career progression because women are distracted between separate spheres of activity; they spread time away from being an employee to include being a primary carer. Those working in the teaching profession are not immune to this constructed way of being and are also ill-defined in terms of their professional identity. Motherhood, however, is an enabling experience and shares a purposeful intent common with that of teaching; motherhood is an experience teaching can learn from rather than it disabling professional progression and development. Drawing upon phenomenological understandings of knowledge development and survey and interview methods of data collection from teacher educators working in a University's School of Education, findings from this enquiry indicate women considered their professional identity to have been influenced and enhanced by the experience of motherhood. Understandings of a teacher educator's professional identity were expressed in terms of relational, empathetic and value-led practice, which were expressions of their own personalities informed by motherhood. Whilst priorities had shifted as a result of becoming a mother, findings indicated teacher educators considered themselves to have become more reflexive and adaptable as a consequence of being a mother. Implications of this <b>enquiry</b> <b>call</b> for continuing professional development and return to work programmes to engage women in a dialogue about how motherhood benefits their professional identity and is an experience that should be celebrated in terms of career development rather than being accepted as a professional limitation...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} project considers the photograph {{as a common}} space, a space of encounter that unsettles the relations between word and image. It calls for a thinking of the photograph alongside notions of commonality {{at a time of}} increasing fragmentation and alienation in terms of what is communicable. The project is driven by different forms of description as a methodology and mode of enquiry. These methods of description constitute a series of experiments in writing and photography. They are presented in the thesis as image and text works and accompanying the thesis as an installation of photographic works and composition of voice recordings. The context of the research engages practices of space and everyday life along side ideas about community and commonality. Methods of description draw out the relationship between word and image, examining different particularities between writing as image and the construction of photographic sequences as a visual syntax in order to question the limits of description in relation to the photographic image and human encounter. The process of research is framed within a series of on-going conversations that embed themselves within thinking about and making photographs. Sitting on park benches and considering the space of The Look and the work Jean-Paul Sartre, converses with a series of photographs and writings that describe a space of human encounter. The description of Charles Bovary’s Hat in the opening sequence of Madame Bovary 1 by Gustave Flaubert, informs a descriptive method and thinking about the photograph as a kind of mute or stuttering face. A dialogue with Walker Evan’s Labor Anonymous photographs emerges through experimental forms of writing and cropping. This concludes in a series of 150 sentences and photographic fragments that cover the entirety of the photographs in the Labor Anonymous archive, replacing editing with a process of cropping in order to approach an anonymous space within the photographic image. The thesis ends with photographs of discarded piles of organic matter constructed through a rigorous method of writing drawn out of the phenomenology of Emmanuel Levinas and a reading of Alain Robbe-Grillet and Francis Ponges. Here the photograph is presented as an exhausted site where word and image exist alongside each other, radically passive, together — apart. Making a series of voice recordings enables an exploration of the incommensurability of word and image approaching problems surrounding a thinking of the face, and the face-to-face encounter through the photograph. Throughout the project a problem of pronouns is evoked, an uncomfortable sense of the relations between us all in looking and thinking about the space of the image and how it can be constituted and conveyed. Processes of description developed through the different forms of <b>enquiry</b> <b>call</b> us to the urgent task of considering the photographic image as a site of commonality and a space of community...|$|E

40|$|The present {{investigation}} analyzes critically the discursive and generic make-up, the conceptual base and educational goals {{of a new}} interdisciplinary academic field of <b>enquiry</b> <b>called</b> Intercultural Business Communication as it is pursued {{in the context of}} the Germany higher education system. Its purpose is twofold: Firstly, it attempts to bring to light and debate the actual validity claims made by these authors in respect to socio-economic changes and the educational promise of intercultural understanding through intercultural training. Secondly, it shows how aspects of context (e. g. interdisciplinary relations, disciplinary intricacies, hegemonic discourses, changes in the higher educational system and its relation to other social spheres) can impact upon the discourse and genre of social science in general and this particular field in particular. By drawing upon Critical Discourse Analysis as a theoretical stance and a methodological path, a corpus of 24 academic articles published in this area is analyzed in relation to the recontextualization of socio-economic changes (presences and absences of social actors, processes and evaluation), the legitimation of educational goals through reference to these changes, the conceptualization of key terms (like culture, the other etc.), the implications of these theoretical decisions for the possibility of increased, mutual understanding and the form of academic writing (argumentation, debate, genre change). While the thesis aims to identify specific discursive and generic patterns, open them to contestation, and to explain their presence in these texts, it is also strongly normative and discusses questions related to the changing understanding of the nature, form and function of academic knowledge production in society. <br/...|$|R

The recommendation of the Transport Users' Consultative Committee for the South East Region (TUCC) was that replacement buses would not alleviate the hardship caused by the line's closure.

Frustrated by what they saw as intransigence, the British commissioners launched a full-scale military assault on the Caribs in 1772 with the objective of subjugating and deporting them from the island. British unfamiliarity with the windward lands of the island and effective Carib defence of the island's difficult mountain terrain blunted the British advance, and political opposition to the expedition in London prompted an <b>enquiry</b> and <b>calls</b> for it to be ended.

40|$|Conspiracy {{theories}} point accusing {{fingers at}} authorities, and offer alternatives to official explanations. Scholars {{have argued that}} in doing so, they may therefore subvert social systems and undermine confidence in established political, health and environmental positions. In this thesis we empirically put these arguments to the test. In four experiments, we found that exposure to conspiracy theories reduced people’s intention to engage in (a) the political system, (b) environmentally-friendly initiatives and (c) childhood vaccination (Chapters 2 and 3). Ironically however, instead of undermining the social status quo, we found in four experiments that conspiracy theories appear to bolster satisfaction with social systems. They appear to {{do so because they}} explain tragedies, disasters and social problems on the actions of destructive individuals and groups, rather than inherent flaws in society. By drawing attention away from the deeper limitations of social systems, conspiracy theories may therefore reduce, rather than increase, the likelihood of social and political change (Chapter 4). Finally, we found that once people have been exposed to conspiracy theories, the negative effects are difficult to attenuate. In two experiments we tested interventions based on counter-arguments (e. g., that vaccines are safe instead of harmful) and a pre-warning that detailed people’s tendency to rely on retracted information. However, both were found to be ineffective in improving intentions to vaccinate a fictional child (Chapter 5). Overall, the research outlined in this thesis highlights some of the potentially damaging consequences of conspiracy theories. This research opens up new avenues for <b>enquiry</b> and <b>calls</b> for ongoing investigations to address the growth of conspiracism in society...|$|R
40|$|What {{is special}} about picturing {{according}} to the rules of perspectival drawing systems? My answer is at once both radical and conciliatory. I think that depiction essentially involves a distinctive experience, an experience of resemblance. More precisely, the picture must be seen as preserving what Thomas Reid (<b>Enquiry</b> 1764) <b>called</b> the "visible figure" of what is represented. It follows from this, and from some other plausible premises, that if a picture is to depict detailed spatial arrangements, rather than simply to represent them in some other, non-pictorial, way, it must conform to perspectival rules. Hence the radicalism. Perspective does not provide uniquely accurate or realistic ways to depict things, but, for certain aspects of the world, the only way to depict them at all. What of the conciliatory aspect of my view? My account of depiction in no way implies that only perspectival pictures can depict anything at all. Indeed, it is quite consistent with a good deal of variation in the marks which might, in the right context, depict a given content. But better still, the factors determining what we see a picture as resembling, and hence partially determining what it depicts, are just those factors emphasized by those who take perspective {{to be a matter of}} convention. They include, for instance, the nature of the subject's perceptual environment, and the sorts of pictures to which he has previously been exposed. Thus, even given the radical claim, the variety in ways of depicting a given thing is neither incomprehensible nor indicative of some kind of failure. We can understand perspective's special status without denigrating the alternatives. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to conceptualize the unique value that can be created by {{performing}} a commodity process, in this case call handling at a call center, as a means of challenging the prevalent assumption that an organization should differentiate between the management of a core competence and a commodity process. Design/methodology/approach – An inductive case study is conducted to examine the strategic planning and management of a call center in one of the largest retailers headquartered in the UK. Semi‐structured interviews, informal dialogue, on‐site observation and documentation were the four data collection methods that we used. Findings – Based on the findings derived from the study, this study proposes the notion of a “differentiated commodity” to illustrate that a commodity process, such as handling customers' complaints and <b>enquiries</b> using standard <b>call</b> center technologies, can be significantly beneficial to the business, if differentiation was embedded into the architecture and management of the business process. Originality/value – The distinction between core competencies and commodity processes has become one of the key aspects in shaping a manager's decision making.

Como fonte de observação, o corpus selecionado para nossa análise se constituiu de transcrições de entrevistas de três personalidades do cenário político envolvidos num esquema de corrupção (Roberto Jefferson, José Dirceu e José Genoíno), veiculadas pelo programa Roda Viva, exibido pela Rede Cultura de televisão. Constituinte do gênero de informação midiática, a entrevista política se consubstancia como uma prática discursiva-social que visa atender aos apelos da vida cidadã, daí nosso interesse por ela. Além disso, cabe ressaltar que, por se tratar de discursos autênticos processados em tempo real, já que o programa é transmitido ao vivo, essa situação particular de interação teve a virtude de nos fornecer grandes unidades pragmáticas que nos permitiram evitar generalizações superficiais do fenômeno discursivo bem como nos fornecer dados mais precisos para a descrição da pergunta. Da observação dos parâmetros definidores da força diretiva da pergunta, constatamos que a direção de ajustamento mundo-palavra que ela implica refere-se à entrada do interlocutor na interação discursiva, ou seja, trata-se de um ato que incide sobre o interlocutor, fazendo-o agir em forma de linguagem, consubstanciando-se, assim, como o ato constitutivo da interação. Da relação entre a direcionalidade apontada pela pergunta e o fato de o interlocutor assumi-la ou não, revelado na resposta, constatamos quatro padrões diferentes de interação gerados a partir daí. A classificação desses padrões se deu pelo reconhecimento de que ato de fala pergunta se realiza como ato ilocucional, nos casos prototípicos, e que, quando a ele se adicionam outras intenções, ele serve de suporte para atos perlocucionais. Tendo em vista o gênero analisado, percebemos que a materialidade da interação aqui em tela impôs fortes restrições para a disposição psicossocial dos sujeitos envolvidos nessa prática de linguagem. Já que se tratava de uma interação transmitida ao vivo, tinha-se a presença virtual desse telespectador que representa a opinião pública tão cara aos políticos e às instâncias midiáticas. Assim, as instâncias de produção, aqui desdobradas em entrevistadores e entrevistados, e a instância de recepção, caracterizada pela audiência do programa, se achavam engajadas num processo de transação, no qual a primeira desempenhou o duplo papel de interpelador e testemunha do mundo, e a segunda, hipoteticamente, um papel reativo diante das trocas instauradas na e pela entrevista. Daí que tanto entrevistadores quanto entrevistados se mostraram fortemente engajados nos seus projetos de fala para suscitar interesse desse público, com fins de fazer saber, fazer pensar ou fazer sentir. Enfim, pudemos constatar que o ato de fala pergunta na situação discursiva aqui em análise, antes de ser um questionamento sobre um estado de coisas, configurou-se como uma implicatura para o sujeito, uma vez que a pergunta põe em questão o próprio sujeito, que busca, então, estabelecer uma coerência que assegurará a identidade por ele pretendida. Por outro lado, a pergunta é formulada tendo em vista o sujeito que é posto em questão, e, por meio dele, tudo o que lhe diz respeito, tudo o que o envolve. Dito de outra forma, a pergunta instaura identidades e ao interlocutor cabe reafirmá-las ou não. E ao público, cabe a função de decodificar esse simulacro da realidade exibido pelas mídias. This paper aims {{to undertake}} {{an analysis of}} the speech act of question in a discursive-interactional perspective. From the integration between the Theory of the Speech Acts, the Semiolinguistics and the Interactionism proposed by Marcel Burger, our specific objectives were to identify the nature of this act, the particular type of action it performs, the restrictions imposed on the answers, its enunciative properties as well as its interactionaldiscursive dimension. Another purpose was to analyze the correlation question / answer in order to identify the effect of the imbalance of the intentionalities between them. As source of observation, the data selected for our analysis consisted of transcripts of interviews of three personalities of the political scenario involved in a corruption scheme (Roberto Jefferson, Jose Dirceu and Jose Genoíno), shown by Roda Viva program, transmitted by the Rede Cultura de Televisão. Constituent of the media information genre, the political interview consolidates itself as a social-discursive practice which intends {{to meet the demands of}} citizen life, hence our interest in it. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that as they are authentic speeches processed in real time, once the program is broadcasted live, this particular situation of interaction has provided relevant pragmatic units, which enabled us to avoid superficial generalizations of the discursive phenomenon; moreover, it furnished us with more accurate data to the description of the question. From the observation of the parameters that define the directive force of the question, we verified that the world-word direction of adjustment, which it implies, refers to the entry of the speaker in the discursive interaction, that is to say, it is an act that falls upon the speaker leading him to act in the language form, consolidating therefore, the constitutive act of interaction. From the connection between the directionality pointed by the question and its acceptance or not shown in the speakers response, we testified four different patterns of interaction generated from there. The classification of these patterns occurred by the recognition that the speech act of question is performed as an illocutional act in prototypic cases and also that when other intentions are added to it, it serves as support for perlocutional acts. On the strength of the analyzed genre, we realized that the materiality of the interaction, here on screen, has imposed heavy restrictions on the psychosocial disposition of the subjects involved in this practice of language. Since it was an interaction broadcasted live, there was the virtual presence of the televiewer that represents the public opinion, so dear to politicians and to the media. Thus, the parties of production, here represented by interviewers and interviewees, and the party of reception, characterized by the audience of the program, were engaged in a process of transaction, in which the former performed the dual role of interpellator and witness of the world and the latter, hypothetically, a reactive role in face of the exchanges placed in and through the interview. Therefore, both interviewers and interviewees were strongly engaged in their speech projects, to arouse interest from the public for purposes of making knowing, making thinking or making feeling. Finally, we could certify that the speech act of question, in the discursive situation here analyzed, rather than being a questioning on a state of affairs, is an implicature to the subject, due to the fact that the <b>enquiry</b> <b>calls</b> into question the subject himself, who tries, then, to establish a coherency that will ensure the identity he has sought. On the other hand, the question is formulated in view of the subject that is questioned, through him, all that concerns him and everything that surrounds him. In other words, the question establishes identities and it is up to the speaker to reaffirm them or not. The publics role is to decode this simulacrum of reality shown by the media...|$|R
