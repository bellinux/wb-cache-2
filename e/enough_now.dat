25|$|Protagoras {{does not}} deny being a Sophist, and claims {{that it is an}} ancient and honorable art, the same art practiced by Homer and Hesiod. These poets, he says, used the arts as a screen, a front, to protect {{themselves}} from the charge. He says that he is more straightforward than the ancient artists, trainers, and musicians in frankly admitting that he is an educator. Protagoras says he is old <b>enough</b> <b>now</b> to be the father of any of the men present, and would like now to address himself to the whole company of people in the house. Socrates assumes that Prodicus would not want to miss the lecture, and so Callias and Alcibiades are sent to rouse him from his bed (317c–e). According to Francis Bacon, Prodicus is led to produce a speech in the dialogue (337a), which seems to Bacon as humiliating for him.|$|E
500|$|The UEFA Champions League is a {{continental}} club football competition organised by UEFA. Founded in the 1950s as the European Champion Clubs' Cup, {{the competition was}} open to champion clubs of each country and arranged as a straight knockout tournament. The growth of television rights saw the format rebranded in the 1990s to include a group stage and permit multiple entrants. Arsenal had qualified for every Champions League season since 1998–99, but the club never progressed further than the quarter-final stage. Ahead of the new campaign, Wenger assessed his team needed to perform in the home games, adding: [...] "We are mature <b>enough</b> <b>now</b> and we must add that little bit of sparkle to make the difference." ...|$|E

500|$|Sarah Warn, {{editor-in-chief}} of lesbian-based website AfterEllen.com {{wrote that the}} episode's focus on Naomi and Emily [...] "was one of the best-developed and most honest depictions of a lesbian teenage relationship that I've ever seen on TV." [...] A critic for PopSugar.com thought both Naomi and Cook to be more likable after the episode and enjoyed {{the development of their}} friendship throughout. They found Emily's plea to Naomi as Naomi left the campsite [...] "heartbreaking" [...] and called Kieran [...] "one of my favourite recurring characters this series". Digital Spy's Dan French gave the episode a positive review, describing it as [...] "chaotic" [...] and [...] "full of lady-lovin'". He praised Naomi's relationship with Kieran, which he saw as a reference to the affair between Chris Miles, a first generation character from Skins first and second series, and his teacher Angie. The entertainment editor for eurOut.org, a website for European lesbians, thought that Naomi and Emily's storyline was [...] "definitely one of the best portrayals of teenage lesbians I've ever seen", writing that [...] "when the focus is more on cute girls falling for each other, this show isn't half bad". Another eurOut.org writer, Cate O'Neil, said that [...] "Naomi" [...] was [...] "probably the best individual lesbian episode I have seen on TV. Ever." [...] In response to O'Hanlon's nude scene as Kieran, Sara Nathan of The Sun said, [...] "If seeing [...] clad in lycra as Thermoman in My Hero wasn't bad <b>enough,</b> <b>now</b> he's leaving nothing to the imagination." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the 1886 season Spalding sold Kelly to the Boston Beaneaters for a then-record $10,000, after Kelly {{balked at}} {{returning}} to the club. Right before the sale, Chicago writer Happy Palmer quoted Spalding about his plans to manage Kelly: [...] "Oh, tie him up, I guess, if he really is averse to playing here. He may have his ugly up, and I guess {{from the way he}} is holding out in his refusal to sign that that is the case. All right, though. I am willing, and if he keeps on in that spirit I’ll make him eat hay with his horses before he is much older. He has been mad long <b>enough</b> <b>now,</b> and it is pretty near time somebody was getting mad at this end of the line.

[...] Greenwood went on:"What really is a serious {{matter is that the}} time and energy of the War Cabinet, which should think of nothing but this awful War, where men are slaughtered daily, have been wasted by innumerable deputations, by arguments for and against, and by the pursuit of this phantom of a great national shipyard on the mud flats of a river in the West of England. Up to the present not a ship has been produced, and {{there is no sign of}} a ship being produced for years.

2500|$|North American beaver (Castor canadensis) — {{found in}} {{small and large}} low-gradient streams, {{including}} tidal parts of the lower Connecticut River, as well as lakes and other water that is both permanently present and deep enough not to freeze {{all the way to}} the bottom in winter; most common where its favorite food plants are (such as aspen, birch, willow, cottonwood and soft aquatic plants); they not only dam up smaller streams but can be found in rivers too big to be dammed; common in the state before the arrival of Europeans; trapping led to their extirpation in the state by about 1842, then were reintroduced, first in Union in 1914, and at other times up to the 1950s. They thrived so well that in 1961, the first state-regulated trapping season began in order to manage their numbers in light of growing nuissance complaints; the population is large <b>enough</b> <b>now</b> to be trapped, and generally 500 to 1,000 are trapped each year; in the 2001–2002 season a record 1,224 were trapped; in 2000 it was estimated there were between 5,000 and 8,000 beavers in the state; they can annoy homeowners with their tree cutting and flooding from their dams (which help some species but hurt others); in Connecticut, people must get a permit from their town wetlands commission before altering beaver dams to prevent or reduce flooding ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the 1978 season, Oakland owner Finley again {{sought to}} discard Coleman, {{asking him to}} report to the Athletics' minor league club in Vancouver. [...] Coleman refused and {{compiled}} a 3–0 record and a 0.00 ERA in his first eight appearances of the 1978 season. [...] Coleman had a 1.37 ERA when he was sold by Oakland to the Toronto Blue Jays for the waiver price of $10,000. [...] Finley reportedly [...] "blew his top" [...] after Coleman gave up a home run to Chicago's Lamar Johnson. Bobby Winkles resigned as Oakland's manager after Finley's impulsive decision to sell the club's most effective relief pitcher. [...] Days later, Finley offered to buy Coleman back from Toronto for double the price Toronto had paid. Blue Jays' president, Peter Bavasi, declined Finley's proposal, suspecting that Finley had found another team prepared to pay more for Coleman. [...] Coleman noted {{at the time that he}} was happy to escape Finley. [...] After his bid to reacquire Coleman was rejected, Finley claimed he had only wanted to reacquire Coleman to trade him to Pittsburgh and lashed out at Coleman: [...] "He's a very fine old man, but all he does is throw that slop up there.

2500|$|Rawlinson {{argued that}} Christianity could {{not succeed in}} China if it was {{identified}} with either imperialist domination or capitalist exploitation. In particular, {{he pointed out that}} it was [...] "somewhat humiliating" [...] to force China to grant permission for [...] "Christian aliens" [...] to build churches and propagate their religion under protection of extraterritoriality. [...] He welcomed Chinese colleagues into the leadership of Christian institutions and supported the anti-imperialist program of the Chinese Nationalist Party. The spread of Marxism raised serious questions, however. Rawlinson approved the egalitarian social aims which Chinese communists announced while condemning their violent methods. [...] In 1934, the Chinese Recorder ran a series of articles on [...] "The Challenge of Communism," [...] the title of a missionary conference. Rawlinson conceded that if it sought a [...] "juster and more equitable social order," [...] communism was supportable. In that year, Chiang Kai-shek launched his New Life Movement as an answer to communism's social appeal. Rawlinson applauded, but looked to the Rural Reconstruction Movement for a Christian approach to the problems of China's rural majority. Rawlinson's June 1934 editorial, [...] "Beyond Communism," [...] reminded readers that as doctrine Christianity was [...] "adverse" [...] to capitalism but in fact had accommodated to it easily <b>enough.</b> <b>Now</b> Christianity found that communism had [...] "stolen its thunder," [...] for Christianity had never set out to [...] "change the entire lot of the underprivileged as communism has." [...] Christianity was preferable to communism but had to prove itself in action.|$|E
2500|$|Ted Dexter was a {{cavalier}} batsman {{in the old}} amateur {{style and}} a ferocious strokemaker, but was known as being moody and mercurial. As a batsman he could leave {{the hands of the}} fielders team bruised and reddened with his powerful drives and cuts. [...] To see [...] "Lord Ted" [...] thrashing the fast bowling {{was one of the most}} thrilling sights in cricket and he could make any run chase look possible. His great fault was that he seldom gave a bowling attack due respect and got himself out with rash strokes. Though more a batsman than a bowler he could seam and swing the ball, was a useful third paceman even at Test level and was an excellent fielder anywhere. Dexter was a natural one day player, where his big hitting, tidy bowling, keen fielding and lively captaincy gave Sussex their first two trophies – the inaugural Gillette Cup in 1963 and again in 1964. He devised innovative field placings for limited overs games and his 'ideas changed the game forever. It is no exaggeration to say that Dexter was the man who shaped modern cricket'. In first-class matches he bored easily and his strokes of genius were in the end outweighed by his mistakes. As captain he had [...] "more theories than Charles Darwin", sometimes shifting fielders on a whim and was hailed as a genius if a wicket fell as a result. He was dictatorial on the field, rarely consulting with his bowlers about field placings and pulling them off by saying [...] "You've had <b>enough</b> <b>now.</b> Get down to third man" ...|$|E
2500|$|Marking 200 {{years after}} this novel was published, Paula Byrne, {{author of a}} {{biography}} of Jane Austen, wrote a perspective on it, a novel she loves, while aware that Mansfield Park is not generally viewed as she sees it. The subtitle to Byrne's article was [...] "Ignore its uptight reputation – Mansfield Park, published 200 years ago this month, seethes with sex and explores England’s murkiest corners". The title of the novel and the family estate may well reflect Lord Mansfield, whose decision as Lord Chief Justice in a court case led {{to the end of}} slavery in Britain itself, and the name of Aunt Norris may be drawn from Robert Norris, the opposite of the judge, as Norris was [...] "an infamous slave trader and a byword for pro-slavery sympathies." [...] Sir Thomas Bertram's home, Mansfield Park, was [...] "a newly built property, a house erected on the proceeds of the British slave trade." [...] It is not an old structure like the one belonging to Rushworth, or the estate homes described in other of Austen's novels, like Pemberley in Pride and Prejudice or Domwell Abbey in Emma. Byrne finds this novel bold in its humour, containing [...] "Austen’s filthiest joke, when she makes a pun about sodomy in the Navy: “My home at my uncle’s brought me acquainted with a circle of admirals. Of Rears and Vices, I saw <b>enough.</b> <b>Now,</b> do not be suspecting me of a pun, I entreat.”" [...] She posits that the heroine Fanny Price is [...] "the filter through which we view the mesmerising Crawfords", the Londoners who bring their lively, seductive ways to the countryside. She finds this novel to be [...] "pioneering because it is a novel about meritocracy." [...] The novel is an exploration of the role of parents in raising their children and forming their moral characters, as shown by Sir Thomas in his changing view of his niece: he first feels that she is not on the same level as his daughters, but at the end, he acknowledges her advantages in starting from hardship in her parents' home, recognizing his failings in guiding his own daughters.
