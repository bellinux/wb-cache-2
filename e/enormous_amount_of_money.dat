5|$|Tiberius Gracchus {{was elected}} tribune in 133 BC. He {{attempted}} {{to enact a}} law which would have limited the amount of land that any individual could own. The aristocrats, who stood to lose an <b>enormous</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> were bitterly opposed to this proposal. Tiberius submitted this law to the Plebeian Council, but the law was vetoed by a tribune named Marcus Octavius. Tiberius then used the Plebeian Council to impeach Octavius. The theory, that {{a representative of the}} people ceases to be one when he acts against the wishes of the people, was counter to Roman constitutional theory. If carried to its logical end, this theory would remove all constitutional restraints on the popular will, and put the state under the absolute control of a temporary popular majority. His law was enacted, but Tiberius was murdered with 300 of his associates when he stood for reelection to the tribunate.|$|E

25|$|The same year, 1793, a new {{parliament}} {{was held in}} Negrete on the northern frontier {{with the aim of}} ratifying and renewing the older Treaty of Lonquilmo from 1783. Copying older treaties, the King of Spain was confirmed as the sovereign of the Araucanía, while the possession of the land was reserved for the Mapuches, which resulted in a de jure sovereignty of the King of Spain but in a de facto independence of the Mapuche-controlled lands. The treaty celebrations were held from March 4 to March 7, with many banquets of wine and meat being held for the numerous participants. The whole treaty cost 10.897 pesos, which was, according to Diego Barros Arana, an <b>enormous</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> considering the size of Chile's treasury.|$|E
500|$|Gilligan {{inserted}} {{a reference to}} the villain Eugene Victor Tooms from the first season episodes [...] "Squeeze" [...] and [...] "Tooms" [...] in a conversation between Ryan and Mulder. The episode represents one of the first entries in the series to be written by someone from outside the main writing staff of The X-Files. Originally, the script called for Banton's shadow {{to be able to move}} independently; Carter and writer Howard Gordon rewrote the story to remove this aspect. Gilligan later noted, [...] "they rewrote the episode [...] this saved an <b>enormous</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> in animation costs." [...] In addition, the [...] character of X was not in the first draft of the script. However, the series staff realized that Banton's fear of having the government control him should be [...] "more than just paranoia". Thus, X was written into the story. Writer Frank Spotnitz later noted, [...] "it had been a long time since X had done anything and the character really needed to grow." ...|$|E
500|$|Tiberius Gracchus {{was elected}} Plebeian Tribune in 133 BC, and as Tribune, he {{attempted}} to enact {{a law that would}} have distributed land amongst Rome's landless citizens. [...] The aristocrats, who stood to lose an <b>enormous</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> were bitterly opposed to this proposal. Tiberius submitted this law to the Plebeian Council, but the law was vetoed by a Tribune named Marcus Octavius, and so Tiberius used the Plebeian Council to impeach Octavius. The theory, that a representative of the people ceases to be one when he acts against the wishes of the people, was repugnant to the genius of Roman constitutional theory. If carried to its logical end, this theory removed all constitutional restraints on the popular will, and put the state under the absolute control of a temporary popular majority. This theory ultimately found its logical end under the future democratic empire of the military populist Julius Caesar. The law was enacted, but Tiberius was murdered when he stood for reelection to the Tribunate. The ten years that followed his death were politically inactive. The only important development was in the growing strength of the democratic opposition to the aristocracy.|$|E

2500|$|Back in the 1860s, {{when the}} town of Crystal Lake was about 25 years old, Charles S. Dole {{purchased}} over [...] of land overlooking the lake. It was his dream to construct an elaborate estate that would reflect his position as a successful businessman. He was an early member of the Chicago Board of Trade, being associated with Armour, Dole & Co. in Chicago. To carry out his plan, he built a three-story mansion with adjoining gardens and stables. European craftsmen were imported to lay parquet floors, fashion archways and carve interior wood work from black walnut trees grown on the property. As a final touch, he brought in Italian artisans to build several marble fireplaces. According to Mr. Dole's obituary, construction costs exceeded $100,000, an <b>enormous</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> in those days.|$|E
2500|$|The UK's National Health Service {{announced}} in 2008 that more therapists would {{be trained to}} provide CBT at government expense {{as part of an}} initiative called Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT). the NICE said that CBT would become the mainstay of treatment for non-severe depression, with medication used only in cases where CBT had failed. Therapists complained that the data does not fully support the attention and funding CBT receives. Psychotherapist and professor Andrew Samuels stated that this constitutes [...] "a coup, a power play by a community that has suddenly found itself on the brink of corralling an <b>enormous</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money...</b> Everyone has been seduced by CBT's apparent cheapness." [...] The UK Council for Psychotherapy issued a press release in 2012 saying that the IAPT's policies were undermining traditional psychotherapy and criticized proposals that would limit some approved therapies to CBT, claiming that they restricted patients to [...] "a watered down version of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), often delivered by very lightly trained staff".|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, an ICE {{audit of}} American Apparel's {{employment}} records uncovered discrepancies in the documentation of about 25% of the company's workers, implying mainly {{that they were}} undocumented immigrants. About 1,500 workers were let go in September of that year as a result. American Apparel responded with questions {{of the effectiveness of}} such an action and said [...] " [...] will not help the economy, will not make us safer. No matter how we choose to define or label them [...] are hard-working, taxpaying workers.” The ICE audit highlighted a new strategy from President Obama which announced they were shifting away from high-profile raids. According to CEO Dov Charney, American Apparel promised its workers who were fired for improper immigration documentation that they would be given [...] "priority treatment, in terms of being interviewed for future positions with the company," [...] if and when they [...] "got [...] immigration papers in order." [...] Commenting on the loss of 1,500 workers due to concerns over illegal immigration Charney said [...] "It broke our efficiencies and generated a situation where we were late delivering garments.

After considerable argument, during which he set forth as prominently as possible the <b>enormous</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> that could be earned, of which she should have a fair share, Johnny succeeded in gaining Mrs. Green's consent to the plan.

60|$|Gervaise {{found that}} no attempt {{was to be}} made to take the {{offensive}} against the Turks, and that they were to be permitted to advance against the city without interference. Many of the more fiery spirits among the knights chafed at this prohibition. The records of the past showed that armies as large as that of Mahomet had suffered defeat at the hands of bodies of knights no stronger than that gathered for the defence of Rhodes. D'Aubusson, however, knew that between the undisciplined hordes that gathered in countless numbers to oppose the crusaders, and the troops of Mahomet, well trained in warfare, who had borne his standard victoriously in numerous battles, there was but little comparison. They were commanded, too, by Paleologus, a general of great capacity. Under such circumstances, although victory might be possible, the chances of defeat would be far greater, and while victory could be only won at a great sacrifice of life, defeat would mean annihilation to the garrison, and the loss of the city upon whose fortifications such an <b>enormous</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> and labour had been expended.|$|E

6000|$|For {{twenty years}} Scott labored {{steadily}} at literature, with the double object of giving {{what was in}} him, and of earning large sums to support the lavish display which he deemed essential to a laird of Scotland. In 1826, while he was blithely at work on Woodstock, the crash came. Not even the vast earnings of all these popular novels could longer keep the wretched business of Ballantyne on its feet, and the firm failed, after years of mismanagement. Though a silent partner, Scott assumed full responsibility, and at fifty-five years of age, sick, suffering, and with all his best work behind him, he found himself facing a debt of over half a million dollars. The firm could easily have compromised with its creditors; but Scott refused to hear of bankruptcy laws under which he could have taken refuge. He assumed the entire debt as a personal one, and set resolutely to work to pay every penny. Times were indeed changed in England when, instead of a literary genius starving until some wealthy patron gave him a pension, this man, aided by his pen alone, could confidently begin to earn that <b>enormous</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> And {{this is one of}} the unnoticed results of the popularization of literature. Without a doubt Scott would have accomplished the task, had he been granted only a few years of health. He still lived at Abbotsford, which he had offered to his creditors, but which they generously refused to accept; and in two years, by miscellaneous work, had paid some two hundred thousand dollars of his debt, nearly half of this sum coming from his Life of Napoleon. A new edition of the Waverley novels appeared, which was very successful financially, and Scott had every reason to hope that he would soon face the world owing no man a penny, when he suddenly broke under the strain. In 1830 occurred a stroke of paralysis from which he never fully recovered; though after a little time he was again at work, dictating with splendid patience and resolution. He writes in his diary at this time: [...] "The blow is a stunning one, I suppose, for I scarcely feel it. It is singular, but it comes with as little surprise as if I had a remedy ready, yet God knows I am at sea in the dark, and the vessel leaky." ...|$|E
