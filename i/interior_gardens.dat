On 28 March 1918, the building was ceded to the Ministério de Instrução Pública (Ministry of Public Instruction) and wing occupied by the archbishops was converted into the first Museum D.

The project to expand the episcopal palace was drawn-up in 1922 for the new library and archive, even as the west wing was stilled occupied by the regimental garrison.|$|E

It is little altered since the period when David Alroy is {{supposed}} to have gazed upon it, but it is enriched by the splendid Mosque of Omar, built by the Moslem conquerors on the supposed site of the temple, and which, with its gardens, and arcades, and courts, and fountains, may fairly be described as the most imposing of Moslem fanes. I endeavoured to enter it at the hazard of my life. I was detected, and surrounded by a crowd of turbaned fanatics, and escaped with difficulty; but I saw enough to feel that minute inspection would not belie the general character I formed of it from the Mount of Olives. I caught a glorious glimpse of splendid courts, and light aify gates of Saracenic triumph, flights of noble steps, long arcades, and <b>interior</b> <b>gardens,</b> where silver fountains spouted their tall streams amid the taller cypresses.] ...|$|E

50|$|In 1919 Thomas was {{a member}} of the jury of a {{competition}} launched by New York State for a plan to rehabilitate a tenement block on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Thomas argued in favor of demolition and new construction, saying that the costs of rehabilitation were higher while the standards were lower. Others argued that it was not realistic to demolish 50,000 tenements that had been built under older construction standards, so ways had to be found to upgrade them. Starting in 1919, Thomas advocated construction of U-shaped tenement buildings surrounding <b>interior</b> <b>gardens.</b> The configuration maximized light and air, but kept construction cost to the minimum compared to other configurations. A greater return on investment would be delivered compared to other configurations with less open space. Thus Thomas's entry to the 1921 tenement house competition, sponsored by the Phelps Stokes Fund, featured a large central court. However, it was disqualified because the buildings only covered 60% of the lot.|$|E

40|$|Vertical {{gardens are}} {{considered}} to be quite a recent topic in the world of landscape architecture. Companies are pushed to come up with new technologies regarding application of the vegetation on the vertical surfaces. <b>Interior</b> vertical <b>gardens</b> are more common in Czech Republic than the exterior vertical gardens because of the local climate. <b>Interior</b> vertical <b>gardens</b> are not just beautiful but they present a lot of other positive functions. Nowadays, a lot of people are suffering by the Sick Building Syndrome which is caused by bad microclimate of modern buildings. This problem can be solved by using indoor plants. Indoor plants improve air humidity and quality and have a positive psychological effect. The subject of this thesis is designing three <b>interior</b> vertical <b>gardens</b> in Observatory of the Zizkov tower in Prague. Simple and attractive design of the interior is underlined by the vertical gardens. Objective of the thesis is creating unifying theme of the vertical garden´s design but using different kind of technologies and plants.

The project part of the thesis includes design of the <b>interior</b> vertical <b>gardens,</b> technical information about particular technologies which have been used, planting plans and visualizations 	owadays majority of people spend most of the time indoors. <b>Interior</b> vertical <b>gardens</b> connect people with nature.
