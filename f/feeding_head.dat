40|$|Head and eye {{movements}} were simultaneously recorded during locomotory and pecking behavior of 4 pigeons (CoLumba Livia), which {{were trained to}} traverse a conditioning chamber, with a pecking key and a food dispenser at each end. Each trial involved key pecking, walking, and <b>feeding.</b> <b>Head</b> {{movements were}} registered with a skull-mounted miniature accelerometer, and eye movements were recorded with implanted electrooculographic electrodes. An almost perfect tem-poral coordination between head and eye movements was observed during both walking and feeding bouts. During walking, head movements primarily provide retinal image stability, and eye movements support visual scanning. During <b>feeding,</b> <b>head</b> movements mainly subserve the grasp-ing of food items, and eye movements maintain visual fixation on them. Because the eyes are reflexively closed during the middle phase of pecks, the head and eye movements are then under ballistic control. The peculiar saltatory head motions that many birds ex-hibit while they walk have repeatedly attracted interest in the past. As early as 1930, Dunlap and Mowrer reported that although the body of locomoting chickens, pigeons, and star...|$|E
40|$|The PEHO {{syndrome}} (progressive encephalopathy with oedema, hypsarrhythmia, and optic atrophy) is {{a recently}} recognised disorder of unknown biochemical background. Diagnostic features {{have been found}} in neuroradiological and neuropathological studies, which show characteristic severe cerebellar atrophy. In combined neuroradiological and ophthalmological studies, 10 out of 21 possible PEHO patients fulfilled the criteria for true PEHO syndrome. All were abnormal at birth showing hypotonia, drowsiness, or poor <b>feeding.</b> <b>Head</b> circumference was normal, but usually dropped to 2 SD below average {{during the first year of}} life. Visual fixation was either absent from birth or lost during the first months of life. Nine patients had peripheral oedema in early childhood. The mean age of onset of infantile spasms was 4. 9 months. All patients were extremely hypotonic and no motor milestones were reached. Patellar reflexes were brisk. Brain stem and somatosensory evoked potentials were abnormal in each case studied, cortical responses of somatosensory evoked potentials could not be elicited, and motor conduction velocities became delayed with age. Altogether 19 PEHO patients were found in 14 Finnish families. Autosomal recessive inheritance is likely...|$|E

40|$|Exclusive {{breast feeding}} is {{important}} practice {{that should be}} encouraged for normal growth and development of infants and provide great protection against many diseases. This study is a cross-sectional and non-randomized study that included a total of 343 mother-infant pairs, of which 251 infants were mixed fed, 92 infants were exclusively breast feed for 6 months. The results of growth (weight and length) show similar growth rate between exclusively breast fed infants {{for six months and}} infants who had mixed <b>feeding.</b> <b>Head</b> circumference for exclusive breast fed infants was higher than for mixed fed infants. The results also show significantly higher lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDL and HDL) and total protein levels for infants who were exclusively breast fed for six months compared with infants who were mixed fed while no significant differences in serum albumin between two groups was found. The results indicate that infants who were exclusively breast fed for six months had lower number of gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract and urinary tract infections and otitis media than infants on mixed feeding. Regarding infants development, the current study showed that infants who were breast fed exclusively for six months have earlier gross and fine motor development; also they had early language development than infants who were on mixed feeding. It is concluded that human milk is uniquely superior to infant feeding and it is the healthiest feeding practice for infants and for normal growth and development, because it provides a reasonable protection against many diseases...|$|E
40|$|International audiencemutually exclusive. A recent {{experimental}} study challenged this hypothesis and demonstrated that birds {{are able to}} detect predators while pecking seeds on the ground (head-down vigilance). Experimental obstruction of head-down vigilance makes birds increase head-up vigilance (i. e. the classical overt vigilance posture). For many foragers in the wild, visibility varies between habitats and foraging methods. We compared the vigilance of Teal Anas crecca and Shoveler Anas clypeata when foraging with their eyes above the water surface (shallow feeding, only the bill submerged) and when foraging with their eyes underwater (deep <b>feeding,</b> <b>head</b> and neck underwater, or upending), at three wintering sites in western France. Birds of both species spent less time in head-up vigilance during shallow foraging than during deep foraging, with {{no significant difference between}} sites, which suggests that they are capable of some vigilance during shallow foraging. During deep foraging, the time spent vigilant increased because the frequency of scans was much higher, while scan length decreased. However, these differences could have resulted from variations in the availability of food at different depths. In an experiment where the food availability was constant, we observed the same pattern, with a higher frequency of scans during deep foraging. This study therefore provides strong support for the idea that vigilance and foraging are not always mutually exclusive and shows that switching between searching methods can cause vigilance time – and, as a consequence, loss of feeding time – to vary. This should be taken into account in future field and experimental studies of the trade-off animals make between vigilance and feeding...|$|E
40|$|Thermoplastic {{composites}} offer many attractive {{characteristics such}} as no shelf life, high fracture toughness, high temperature resistance, recyclability etc. The short coming of thermoplastic composites is their high viscosity, even at processing temperature. Due to the high viscosity, techniques for the manufacturing of thermoplastic composite have been limited to molding processes such as compression molding, high temperature stamping, where high temperature, high pressure and long duration are used. The advent of automated fiber placement machine brings forward possibilities to manufacture of large thermoplastic composite components. This {{is due to the}} fact that heating and compaction is done on the go directly on the surface of the substrate, and the flexibility of the <b>feeding</b> <b>head</b> to conform to the shape of the mold. It is in the spirit of exploration for new manufacturing possibilities that Bell Helicopter has supported an inter industry- university project for the development of thermoplastic composite cones aimed at helicopter tail boom applications. The cone represents a segment of the helicopter tail boom. It is made using carbon/PEEK material and automated fiber placement. The work consists of the Determination of the lay-up sequence to address the loads, the Development of the manufacturing processes, the Measurement of temperature variation during the making of a ring, the Checking of the quality of the cone, Development of tube bending test set up, Development of theoretical calculations to determine the buckling load of the cone subjected to bending, Testing the cone under bending load, and Comparing the experimental buckling with calculated buckling load.

40|$|Scan sampling, observing {{animals at}} set {{intervals}} {{is often used}} by behaviorists to reduce labor inputs which are necessary with continuous sampling. The interval used when scan sampling sows housed outdoors on pasture should {{take into consideration the}} desired behavior to be collected. The objective {{of this study was to}} validate scan sampling intervals for sow behaviors and postures when sows were housed outdoors on pasture. Validation for the scanning interval was conducted on 23 sows. Sows were scanned every minute between 0730 and 1130 and then again between 1430 and 1830 by one trained observer on one day in May 2001 at the Sustainable Pork Farm. Six behavioral categories were measured; standing, <b>feeding,</b> <b>head</b> down (rooting and grazing), inactive (lying and sitting), drinking and walking. Scan samples could be taken out to as long as 60 minutes or as little as 15 minutes and still obtain accurate data for most behaviors. Validation of scanning intervals based on correlations for walking (0. 81 vs. 0. 34) and head down (0. 98 vs. 0. 85) were less (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) accurate at 15 min scan than when a 1 -min interval was used. When LSMeans were compared, standing, head and walking became less accurate (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) at a 30 min scan compared to the 1 min scan control. For inactive behaviors there was no differences from 1 min scans until a 60 min scan (P = 0. 03). In conclusion, when the period of scanning was shorter, a more precise prediction of behavior and postures was obtained. However, a balance must be struck between practical feasibility and accuracy when conducting 24 hours of behavioral observations in the field...|$|E

This paper describes the application of mineralogical characterisation techniques in the development of flotation strategies for processing an ore from a low-grade silver deposit that contains a variety of rock types that have undergone hydrothermal alteration where zinc, lead and silver sulphides are typically the primary minerals of economic interest. Comprehensive mineralogical characterisation of the feed, concentrates and tailings from batch flotation tests was undertaken using both the mineral liberation analyser (MLA) and laser ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (LA-ICP-MS). The results of mineralogical characterisation of the <b>feed</b> (<b>head</b> grade, 116 ppm) indicated {{that the majority of the}} silver occurred as solid solution in pyrite which assisted in the development of the flotation strategy used for this ore which resulted in approximately 87 % of the total silver being recovered to rougher concentrate at a grade of 485 ppm.
