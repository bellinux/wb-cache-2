We have studied disomy frequencies in spermatozoa from fathers having Klinefelter syndrome (KS) offspring or miscarriages. The effect of paternal age on sperm disomy percentages is also analysed. METHODS: Parental ori-gin of 17 KS patients {{was carried out by}} amplification of X chromosome polymorphisms. Spermatozoa from their fathers were studied by multicolour fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) using probes for chromosomes 6, 13, 18, 21, 22, X and Y. RESULTS: In 53 % of KS cases studied the additional X chromosome was of paternal origin. The paternally transmitted KS group of fathers showed significantly higher <b>frequencies</b> <b>for</b> XY disomy sperm as com-pared to fathers of the maternal-origin group.

40|$|Introduction Proteins can {{be grouped}} into {{functional}} families, where all members have same or similar function, {{but are not}} necessarily homologous. Sequences of proteins from the same family are usually composed of highly conserved regions separated by regions of variable length that may share sequence similarity. The Resonant Recognition Model (RRM), developed by Cosic and co-workers (1), has demonstrated that each biological function could be characterised by one frequency, the so-called characteristic frequency. Its value is determined on the consensus spectrum obtained by cross multiplying the spectrum of each protein of the family. The peak of that spectrum corresponds to a common <b>frequency</b> <b>for</b> the sequences <b>analysed.</b> However, this approach has concerned some thirty families of protein only, for which {{the applicability of the}} RRM is easily predictable.

40|$|The {{finite element}} method (FEM), an {{advanced}} computer technique of structural stress analysis developed in engineering mechanics, was introduced to orthopedic biomechanics in 1972 to evaluate stresses in human bones. Since then, this method has been applied with increasing <b>frequency</b> <b>for</b> stress <b>analyses</b> of bones and bone-prosthesis structures, fracture fixation devices and various kinds of tissues other than bone. The aims of these investigations were to assess relationships between load carrying functions and morphology of the tissues, and to optimize designs and fixation techniques of implants. Although the amounts of significant findings and useful concepts generated by the FEM during {{the first decade of}} its application in this field were limited, many publications have served to illustrate its capabilities and limitations. The method is now well established as a tool for basic research and for design analysis in orthopedic biomechanics, and the number of publications in which it is used is increasing rapidly. In the meantime, following developments in engineering mechanics, the capabilities of the method are augmented which, together with an increasing sophistication of computers, guaranties exciting possibilities for the future. However, the biological structures and the clinical problems concerned are complex. Scientific progress in this area requires a sound understanding of engineering mechanics on the one hand, and a profound appreciation of the complex reality on the other.

Patients were classified as intact, or neutered early (< 12 mo) or late (≥ 12 mo). Statistical analyses involved survival analyses and incidence rate comparisons. Outcomes at the 5 percent level of significance are reported. Of early-neutered males, 10 percent were diagnosed with HD, double the occurrence in intact males. There were no cases of CCL diagnosed in intact males or females, but in early-neutered males and females the occurrences were 5 percent and 8 percent, respectively. Almost 10 percent of early-neutered males were diagnosed with LSA, 3 times more than intact males. The percentage of HSA cases in late-neutered females (about 8 percent) was 4 times more than intact and early-neutered females.

Protective {{measures}} require accurate and reliable quantification of the designed discharge which we can get using frequency analysis. Flood frequency analysis is a procedure which connects major flood occurrence with its frequency. When there are various samples of the same data available regional frequency analysis can be used. It is based on regions combining different water gauging stations with similar properties. During the analysis not only data for each station but the information for the whole region is used. The main advantage of the regional flood frequency analysis is that estimated values are more accurate especially for stations with lack of data. There are four main steps to perform regional flood frequency analysis. At first, accuracy and discordance of data has to be checked. The second and also the most important step is identification of homogeneous regions. Many grouping methods can be used but the most practical method of forming regions for the large data sets is cluster analysis. At the same time, regional homogeneity can also be checked using a heterogeneity measure. The last two steps are the choice of an appropriate <b>frequency</b> distribution <b>for</b> a region, based on goodness-of-fit tests and estimation of the parameters and quantiles of the selected distribution.
