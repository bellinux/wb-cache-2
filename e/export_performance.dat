25|$|The {{policy of}} {{non-alignment}} during the Cold War meant that Nehru received financial and technical support from both power blocs in building India's industrial base from scratch. Steel mill complexes were built at Bokaro and Rourkela with {{assistance from the}} Soviet Union and West Germany. There was substantial industrial development. Industry grew 7.0 percent annually between 1950 and 1965 – almost trebling industrial output and making India the world's seventh largest industrial country. Nehru's critics, however, contended that India's import substitution industrialisation, which was continued long after the Nehru era, weakened the international competitiveness of its manufacturing industries. India's share of world trade fell from 1.4 per cent in 1951–1960 to 0.5 per cent over 1981–1990. On the other hand, India's <b>export</b> <b>performance</b> is argued to have actually showed sustained improvement over the period.

The obtained results show that movements in the current account balance are mainly driven by domestic variables. In the countries with a flexible exchange rate, real and nominal depreciation affects export positively although the magnitude of these effects is tiny and limited to the crisis period. These results point to a higher significance of non-price competitiveness on export which should be a future research topic...|$|R

Purpose: We present several opportunities that can emerge from using a multilevel approach to study the antecedents of <b>export</b> venture <b>performance,</b> and provide scholars with the conceptual and practical tools for developing multilevel models of export venture success. Design/methodology/approach: Essay.

Research limitations/implications: There may be a need to revisit previous works that utilize samples of single ventures to assess models of <b>export</b> venture <b>performance</b> that are implicitly multilevel.
