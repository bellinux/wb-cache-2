5|$|Having {{gained control}} of the {{soldiers}} <b>his</b> <b>next</b> <b>move,</b> according to Tacitus, was executing {{the leaders of the}} mutiny. He sent out a search party into the surrounding forest to kill those leaders not present for the assembly. Having settled these matters, Drusus returned to Rome.|$|E
5|$|Samaras {{became a}} free agent in early 2017 when Rayo OKC shut down after only one season, and <b>his</b> <b>next</b> <b>move</b> was {{suggested}} to be to Spain to sign for Real Zaragoza. On 8 February, he was unveiled {{at a press conference}} and assigned the number 5 shirt.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his release}} by York, Barrett went on trial with Luton {{and played the}} first half of their first {{friendly}} of the 2011–12 pre-season, a 4–2 victory away to Hitchin Town. He subsequently went on trial with Kingstonian of the Isthmian League Premier Division and played in a friendly against former club Woking. <b>His</b> <b>next</b> <b>move</b> came on 9 September 2011, when he signed for Havant & Waterlooville of the Conference South on non-contract terms, making his debut the following day after starting in a 2–2 draw at home to Sutton United. He was released by Havant in October 2011 after making seven appearances for the club.|$|E
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} Blackest Night conflict, Prometheus {{is in his}} lair {{planning}} <b>his</b> <b>next</b> <b>moves.</b> Hearing a noise, he turns to see Green Arrow, who fires an arrow between Prometheus' eyes, killing him instantly.|$|R
50|$|As {{a part of}} <b>his</b> <b>next</b> <b>moves,</b> it will be {{gaining the}} {{position}} of the Secretary General of the United Nations, through which he can promote his ultimate goal. That goal is a world government with a unique world language and culture.|$|R

5|$|As {{the rift}} between {{the players and}} Brown and between Modell and Brown grew, Modell fired Brown on January 7, 1963. A {{controversy}} developed over {{the timing of the}} decision amid a local newspaper strike, which limited discussion of the move. A printing company executive, however, got together a group of sportswriters and published a 32-page magazine fielding players' views on the firing. Opinions were mixed; Modell came in for his share of criticism, but tackle and team captain Mike McCormack said he did not think the team could win under Brown. Blanton Collier, Brown's longtime assistant, was named the team's new head coach, and Brown began to plan <b>his</b> <b>next</b> <b>move</b> as he continued to receive an $82,500 salary under his eight-year contract.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} {{had reached}} a stalemate and Murad contemplated <b>his</b> <b>next</b> <b>move.</b> He was advised to pillage the countryside, but the surrounding fields had already been burned by Skanderbeg. The sultan decided to stop chasing bodies of men into the forests to prevent further casualties. Mehmed, Murad's son, proposed leaving Svetigrad to strike at Krujë. Murad sternly rejected this, reasoning that the supplies to take Svetigrad would have been wasted and that Krujë would be more strongly defended than Svetigrad. The sultan thus decided to remain at Svetigrad {{in an attempt to}} starve the garrison into submission. Meanwhile, the garrison under the leadership of Peter Perlati made several successful sorties against the Ottomans, in order to ease the encirclement and strengthen his soldiers' morale.|$|E
5|$|Vorenus and Pullo set off {{in search}} of the eagle, encountering and rescuing Octavian from his captors. Octavian thanks them and {{promises}} that they will be rewarded. Vorenus and Pullo discover Pompey's slave with the eagle hiding in the bandit cart and kill him, realizing the bandits were hired by Pompey. A politically astute Octavian explains that their mission is only a gesture, since the theft of the eagle is actually a blessing in disguise to Caesar. Civil war between Caesar and Pompey is inevitable, but Caesar needs Pompey to make the first move so as not to appear the aggressor; Pompey is likely to do that if he believes Caesar's soldiers {{are on the verge of}} desertion. The trio returns in triumph to camp, where a surprised yet grateful Caesar takes the eagle back and more than adequate proof of Pompey's hostility. He sends Pompey the head of his slave and informs him of <b>his</b> <b>next</b> <b>move,</b> to winter the 13th Legion at Ravenna on the Italian border, in preparation for pressing his rights to the Consulship. Pompey breaks all ties with Caesar and takes Cornelia as his wife. Octavia, humiliated at being used by Pompey and heartbroken over her pointless divorce, says she wants him dead.|$|E
50|$|<b>His</b> <b>next</b> career <b>move</b> {{was to move}} to Auburn. Similar to {{his time}} spent at Texas State, Levine {{attended}} classes at the university, and eventually earned a degree at Auburn as an Educational specialist in adult education in 2003.|$|R
50|$|Mayor Wormwood - The Mayor {{attempts}} to woo Paris into signing away his ownership of The Boneyard upon {{his arrival in}} Raven's Hollow, but Paris feels pangs of regret seeing that those living (and not living) on the property would be displaced and have {{nowhere else to go}} in a world that fears them. When Paris refuses to sell the place, Wormwood reveals his true aspect as Beelzebub, the Lord of Lies and {{attempts to}} terrify Paris into relinquishing the deed to the land. Ultimately this fails and Beelzebub retires to Hell to plot <b>his</b> <b>next</b> <b>moves.</b> It remains unrevealed as to why Beelzebub so desires the ownership of the Boneyard.|$|R
2500|$|Bayinnaung {{would have}} to rebuild the kingdom all anew. At Dala, with [...] "few but faithful" [...] troops, he plotted <b>his</b> <b>next</b> <b>moves.</b> <b>His</b> two eldest younger {{brothers}} Minye Sithu and Thado Dhamma Yaza II were with him and remained loyal. Also in his service was an ethnic Mon commander named Binnya Dala who would become his most trusted adviser and [...] "best commander". Because he {{did not yet have}} any foreign mercenaries who could handle firearms, he sent for his favorite Portuguese mercenary Diogo Soares de Mello who had greatly impressed him in the Siamese campaign. Soares, who was abroad, returned with his men (all 39 of them), and he was warmly received by Bayinnaung.|$|R
25|$|The {{placement}} of the queen means White's g2-pawn is overloaded with preventing the knight fork 22...Nf3+ and defending the bishop, so Marshall wins a piece with <b>his</b> <b>next</b> <b>move.</b>|$|E

50|$|It {{was after}} Mudslinger won the 2006 world {{champion}} bull title that his owners evaluated <b>his</b> <b>next</b> career <b>move.</b> H.D. reflected Mudslinger {{qualified for the}} PBR World Finals five times. He was most responsible for turning their business profitable. He was well-known. And he already had calves selling for $30,000.|$|R
50|$|It {{would be}} {{five years before}} Tramp {{returned}} to the studio to record his follow-up album, Recovering the Wasted Years, during which time he would move to Australia, {{with the aim of}} raising his son away from the rigors of big city life and to plan <b>his</b> <b>next</b> career <b>move.</b>|$|R
50|$|As his {{determination}} starting to skyrocket, he quickly moved {{to expand into}} diversification of other businesses. <b>His</b> <b>next</b> big <b>move</b> was in the logistics business, with initial goal to transport their trading materials. Today, his business empire has grown into areas such as plantation, property development, construction, engineering, power generation, infrastructure and ports.|$|R
25|$|The manor {{consisted}} of 10 messuages, 5 cottages, 10 gardens, 10 orchards, 500a. land, 50a meadow, 100a. pasture, 10a. wood, 100a. furze and heath, 50a. moor, 10a. water, 6s.4d. rent, turbary, fishing, etc. in Sierston and Flintham. Because William Fillingham had himself surveyed the estate {{as early as}} 1775 and had arranged to have estimates made of the improved value of Syerston if enclosed, with costs of enclosure, {{it is not difficult}} to guess <b>his</b> <b>next</b> <b>move.</b>|$|E
25|$|While Bragg {{rested his}} troops and planned <b>his</b> <b>next</b> <b>move,</b> Buell marched north from Bowling Green and arrived in Louisville on September 25. Seeing his primary {{objective}} fallen into Union hands, Bragg turned to Bardstown, {{where he had}} expected to meet Smith. Smith was actually operating independently near Frankfort, and Bragg, now painfully aware {{that the lack of}} cooperation with Smith might prove the Confederates' undoing in Kentucky, began to disperse his troops into defensive postures at Bardstown, Shelbyville, and Danville.|$|E
25|$|The fifty-move rule – {{if in the}} {{previous}} 50 moves by each side, no pawn has moved and no capture has been made, a draw may be claimed by either player. Here again, the draw is not automatic and must be claimed if the player wants the draw. If the player whose turn it is to move has made only 49 such moves, he may write <b>his</b> <b>next</b> <b>move</b> on the scoresheet and claim a draw. As with the threefold repetition, the right to claim the draw is forfeited {{if it is not}} used on that move, but the opportunity may occur again.|$|E
50|$|Qe6 is {{a futile}} attempt to unpin the knight (allowing it {{to defend the}} rook) and offer a queen trade, to take some {{pressure}} {{out of the white}} attack. Even if Morphy did not play <b>his</b> <b>next</b> crushing <b>move,</b> he could have always traded his bishop for the knight, followed by winning the rook.|$|R
5000|$|The album marks {{a return}} to {{recording}} following a five-year hiatus since his first solo release, Capricorn, during which time Tramp parted with his former management and label and moved to Australia, {{with the aim of}} raising his son away from the rigors of a big city and to plan <b>his</b> <b>next</b> career <b>move.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Tony prides {{himself on}} knowing many of the {{military}} terms, acronyms and slang that Gibbs regularly uses and which sometimes confuses civilians. Phrases such as these uttered by Tony include [...] "On your six" [...] or [...] "got your six". This refers to the six o'clock position being at the back as 12 o'clock is at the front, as in ground or flying formations (explained in CBS's NCIS Glossary of terms). Throughout the first seasons of the series, Tony {{made it a point}} to explain several agency acronyms to Todd and occasionally to McGee (thus having them become an audience surrogate). Similarly, he also explains Gibbs' unorthodox interrogation techniques to new agents and observers in the observation room and can often accurately predict <b>his</b> <b>next</b> <b>moves.</b>|$|R
25|$|With {{very little}} {{preparation}} after this disaster in Africa {{and the ensuing}} retirement of Rodolfo Graziani, Mussolini then decided on an invasion of Greece as <b>his</b> <b>next</b> <b>move</b> to keep in pace with Germany's recent occupation of Romania. After large propaganda campaigns and even the sinking of a Greek light cruiser, Mussolini then handed an ultimatum to Ioannis Metaxas, Prime Minister of Greece, which would initiate the Greco-Italian War. Hitler was against Mussolini's invasion, (as it would require German troops' help later on), but Mussolini continued without German knowledge, as {{he felt that the}} Nazis had invaded countries too many times without telling Mussolini beforehand.|$|E
25|$|While Himilco was {{capturing}} Messene {{and building}} Tauromenium, Dionysius was busy strengthening his forces. He freed all the slaves in Syracuse to man 60 additional ships, provisioned the fortresses at Syracuse and Leontini with soldiers and supplies, and hired 1,000 mercenaries from Greece. <b>His</b> <b>next</b> <b>move</b> was {{to persuade the}} Campanian mercenaries at Catana to move to Aetna. When he received news that Himilco {{had been forced to}} march inland due to the eruption of Mt. Etna, and the Punic fleet was sailing for Catana, He took his army and fleet to Catana to defeat the Carthaginians in detail. The Greek army numbered 30,000 foot and 3000 horse, while the fleet had 180 ships, mostly made of Quinqueremes.|$|E
25|$|With {{his career}} {{stalling}} McCulloch {{was forced to}} drop down to Division Four in <b>his</b> <b>next</b> <b>move</b> when he joined Brentford in March 1976 for a club record £25000 fee. His move to The Bees rejuvenated his career {{although it was not}} until his second full season (1977–78) that things really started to happen when Brentford achieved promotion with McCulloch scoring 22 goals in 45 League appearances and forming a fine striking partnership with Steve Phillips who contributed an excellent 32 goals. In the Summer of 1978 McCulloch was loaned out to Oakland Stompers of the North American Soccer League where he made 18 appearances, scoring three goals with one assist. Back at Brentford for the 1978–79 campaign, the team consolidated their position in Division Three with McCulloch contributing 13 goals.|$|E
5000|$|<b>His</b> <b>next</b> career <b>move</b> {{was into}} journalism for the Weekly World News and The Sun where he {{reported}} on stories like [...] "Toaster Possessed by the Devil' and [...] "Howdy Doody Dummy comes alive and saves drowning Man." [...] With his unique perspective, Dominick made seven appearances on Late Night with David Letterman {{to discuss his}} unusual assignments.|$|R
50|$|He held {{an amateur}} record of 3-0 before turning {{professional}} {{at the age}} of 17. He lost his professional debut against Sammy Say but defeated him in <b>his</b> <b>next</b> bout to <b>move</b> to 1-1.|$|R
50|$|On 24 January 2011, Donaldson joined Hartlepool United on a month-long loan. He {{made his}} debut the {{following}} day in a 1-1 draw with Notts County. On 25 February, Hartlepool extended Donaldson's loan for a further month. After <b>his</b> <b>next</b> loan <b>move</b> to Tranmere was cut short by a torn hamstring, he was released by Newcastle United on 1 June 2012.|$|R
25|$|As soon as {{the bridge}} was usable, Bülow sent Oppen with three cavalry regiments and a horse {{artillery}} battery after the French. Amey's retreating soldiers met Bigarré's 1st Brigade at Elst where Oppen's troopers found French infantry in position behind the Linge River and the pursuit ended. MacDonald fell back and redeployed his troops {{to hold the line}} of the Waal. Bülow moved west to Utrecht which he occupied on 2 December and paused to consider <b>his</b> <b>next</b> <b>move.</b> Two days later an 8,000-strong British expedition under Thomas Graham, 1st Baron Lynedoch landed in the Netherlands. To his annoyance, Bülow found the newly liberated Dutch people unwilling to volunteer for military service. A cache of 25,000 British muskets intended to arm the Dutch were used to equip the Westphalian Landwehr instead.|$|E
25|$|On August 20, 1057, Isaac Komnenos {{drew out}} his forces and {{arranged}} them for battle at a plain called, according to Michael Attaleiates, Polemon or Haidos. Kekaumenos commanded the left wing, Romanos Skleros the right, and Komnenos positioned {{himself in the}} centre. On the imperial side, Prince Aaron was stationed on the left wing, Basil Tarchaneiotes was positioned on the right, and the centre was commanded by Theodore the Eunuch. The imperial left wing under Prince Aaron completely routed the rebel right wing. Pursuing their troops to the rebel camp, he proceeded to capture Romanos Skleros {{and was on the}} cusp of victory when he hesitated, unsure of <b>his</b> <b>next</b> <b>move.</b> Komnenos, on the verge of fleeing to Nicaea, was able to catch his breath and review what was happening on his left.|$|E
25|$|Following {{his defeat}} at Atlanta, General Hood regrouped his army at Lovejoy's Station, {{following}} which {{they moved to}} Palmetto, Georgia. Here they were reviewed by Confederate President Jefferson Davis, {{who had come to}} speak with Hood about <b>his</b> <b>next</b> <b>move.</b> Even after the disaster at Atlanta, Hood still retained a formidable force of 39,000 men, and though Davis expressed disappointment in the way he had fought in Georgia and spoke of relieving him from command, he ultimately decided that Hood would keep his job. Davis did order Lieutenant General Hardee, the 33rd's longtime corps commander, to a new assignment, replacing him with Frank Cheatham. Hoping to draw Sherman away from Atlanta, Hood and Davis decided that the Army of Tennessee would move north toward Chattanooga, seeking to damage Federal supply lines and force Sherman to do battle on terrain favorable to the Confederates.|$|E
