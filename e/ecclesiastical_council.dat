5|$|At an <b>ecclesiastical</b> <b>council</b> held at Lambeth in 1281, Peckham {{ordered the}} clergy to {{instruct}} their congregations in doctrine {{at least four}} times a year. They were to explain and teach the Articles of Faith, the Ten Commandments, the Works of Mercy, the Seven Deadly Sins, the Seven Virtues and the Sacraments. This command was issued as a canon, or law, of the council, and the group is known as the Lambeth Constitutions. Even later these constitutions were collected as the Ignorantia sacerdotum. The six doctrines comprised the minimum theological knowledge the archbishop considered necessary for the laity to know. The constitutions, which were originally in Latin, were the basis and inspiration for pastoral and devotional works throughout the remainder of the Middle Ages, and were eventually translated into English in the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's brother, Henry of Blois, who was Bishop of Winchester and papal legate in England, {{called an}} <b>ecclesiastical</b> <b>council</b> at Winchester on 29 August 1139, and summoned the king to answer {{charges that he}} had unlawfully arrested clergy. The king refused to attend, and sent a {{representative}} instead. After meeting for a few days, the council was dismissed on 1 September without deciding anything except {{to appeal to the}} pope in Rome. In the end, the appeal never reached Rome. Part of the problem confronting the assembled bishops was that Stephen had not expelled Roger's family from their ecclesiastical offices, merely their secular ones. Stephen's representatives argued that the bishops had given up their castles and money voluntarily to avoid secular charges. The defence taken by the king was not novel; it had been used before by William I and William II against Odo of Bayeux and William de St-Calais, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's brother, Henry of Blois, {{was alarmed}} by this, {{both as a}} matter of principle, since Stephen had {{previously}} agreed in 1135 to respect the freedoms of the church, and more pragmatically because he himself had recently built six castles and had no desire to be treated in the same way. As the papal legate, he summoned the King to appear before an <b>ecclesiastical</b> <b>council</b> to answer for the arrests and seizure of property. Henry asserted the Church's right to investigate and judge all charges against members of the clergy. Stephen sent Aubrey de Vere as his spokesman to the council, who argued that Roger of Salisbury had been arrested not as a bishop, but rather in his role as a baron who had been preparing to change his support to the Empress Matilda. The King was supported by Hugh, Archbishop of Rouen, who challenged the bishops to show how canon law entitled them to build or hold castles. Aubrey threatened that Stephen would complain to the pope that he was being harassed by the English church, and the council let the matter rest following an unsuccessful appeal to Rome. The incident successfully removed any military threat from the bishops, but it may have damaged Stephen's relationship with the senior clergy, and in particular with his brother Henry.|$|E

25|$|Unlike other {{missions}} Jerusalem's Association {{had only}} tiny revenues in foreign exchange out of Nazi control, namely the rent {{from the former}} Armenian Orphanage in Bethlehem, rented out to the British mandatory government for its insane asylum.

25|$|The Narentines {{took more}} liberties in their raiding quests while the Venetian Navy was abroad, as {{when it was}} campaigning in Sicilian waters in 827–882. As soon as the Venetian fleet {{would return to the}} Adriatic, the Narentines {{temporarily}} abandoned their habits again, even signing a Treaty in Venice and baptising their Slavic pagan leader into Christianity. In 834 or 835 they broke the treaty and again they raided Venetian traders returning from Benevento, and all of Venice's military attempts to punish them in 839 and 840 utterly failed. Later, they raided the Venetians more often, together with the Arabs. In 846, the Narentines broke through to Venice itself and raided its lagoon city of Caorle. In the middle of March 870 they kidnapped the Roman Bishop's emissaries that were returning from the <b>Ecclesiastical</b> <b>Council</b> in Constantinople. This caused a Byzantine military action against them that finally brought Christianity to them. After the Arab raids on the Adriatic coast circa 872 and the retreat of the Imperial Navy, the Narentines continued their raids of Venetian waters, causing new conflicts with the Italians in 887–888. The Venetians futilely continued to fight them throughout the 10th and 11th centuries.|$|E

25|$|On 17 November 1917 Britons {{captured}} Jaffa {{and most}} male parishioners of Austrian, German or Ottoman nationality from Jaffa and Sarona, including Rabenau, were interned in Wilhelma as enemy nationals. In 1918 the interned men were deported to a camp south of Gaza, while the parishioners remaining in Jaffa {{were subjected to}} strict police control. In August 1918 the internees were relocated to Sidi Bishr and Helwan near Alexandria in Egypt. Rabenau and the internees built up congregational life in their Egyptian exile, lasting three years. With the Treaty of Versailes becoming effective on 10 January 1920 the Egyptian camps were dissolved and Rabenau became the internees' coordinator of the closedown. Most internees returned to the Holy Land, except of those banned by a British black list, such as D. Dr. Friedrich Jeremias, Provost of Jerusalem. Rabenau went to Germany to reunite with his family, the Britons refused his return to Jaffa in July 1920. In April 1921 the Prussian Evangelical Supreme <b>Ecclesiastical</b> <b>Council</b> appointed Gustaf Dalman, formerly head of the German Protestant Institute of Archaeology in Jerusalem as Provost at the Evangelical Church of the Redeemer until Albrecht Alt arrived.|$|E
500|$|One of Walter's first acts as justiciar was in February 1194, when he {{presided over}} a feudal {{judgement}} of John, Richard's younger brother. [...] After Richard's release from captivity, John, intending to begin a rebellion, had prepared his castles for defence. His letters ordering the preparations were intercepted and John was deprived of his lands. When John {{showed no signs of}} submitting, Walter called an <b>ecclesiastical</b> <b>council</b> at Westminster for the purposes of excommunicating John unless he submitted. John refused to submit, and was excommunicated. To defeat the rebellion, Walter was required to lay siege to Marlborough Castle himself. Walter employed his brother Theobald in similar actions in Lancaster, and rewarded him with the office of sheriff of Lancaster. Eventually in May 1194, John made peace with Richard, and was restored to favour, although the restoration of his lands did not occur until late in 1195.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{missions}} {{depended on}} transferring funds abroad the government rationing {{of foreign exchange}} became the means to blackmail their cooperation. Jerusalem's Association gained a certain support within the German Christian-streamlined old-Prussian Evangelical Supreme <b>Ecclesiastical</b> <b>Council</b> and the Confessing Church, which both collected and transferred funds for the efforts of Jerusalem's Association. Since February 1934 the new Ecclesiastical Foreign Department (Kirchliches Außenamt) under German Christian [...] (1894–1967) of the new Nazi-submissive German Evangelical Church claimed the supervision of German Protestant missions. Heckel also presided the board of trustees of the Evangelical Jerusalem Foundation since 1933.

[...] Even permission to discuss his views in the pulpit was refused. He was allowed to present his views on Thursday afternoons.

The congregation chose half the council, and Edwards was allowed to select {{the other half of}} the council. His congregation, however, limited his selection to one county where the majority of the ministers were against him.

2500|$|The {{traditional}} {{appearance of}} Theravada bhikkhunis is {{nearly identical to}} that of male monks, including a shaved head, shaved eyebrows and saffron robes. In some countries, nuns wear dark chocolate robes or sometimes the same colour as monks. In the Theravada tradition, some scholars believe that the bhikkhuni lineage became extinct in the 11th to 13th centuries and that no new bhikkhunis could be ordained since there were no bhikkhunis left to give ordination. For this reason, {{the leadership of the}} Theravada bhikkhu Sangha in Burma and Thailand deem fully ordained bhikkhunis as impossible. [...] "Equal rights for men and women are denied by the <b>Ecclesiastical</b> <b>Council.</b> No woman can be ordained as a Theravada Buddhist nun or bhikkhuni in Thailand. The Council has issued a national warning that any monk who ordains female monks will severely punished."

50|$|Under Constantine, Christianity did {{not become}} the {{exclusive}} religion of the state, but enjoyed imperial preference, since the Emperor supported it with generous privileges: clerics were exempted from personal services and taxation, Christians were preferred for administrative posts, and bishops were entrusted with judicial responsibilities.

500|$|Bede {{became known}} as Venerable Bede (Lat.: Beda Venerabilis) by the 9th century because of his holiness, {{but this was not}} linked to {{consideration}} for sainthood by the Roman Catholic Church. According to a legend the epithet was miraculously supplied by angels, thus completing his unfinished epitaph. It is first utilised in connection with Bede in the 9th century, where Bede was grouped with others who were called [...] "venerable" [...] at two <b>ecclesiastical</b> <b>councils</b> held at Aachen in 816 and 836. Paul the Deacon then referred to him as venerable consistently. By the 11th and 12th century, it had become commonplace.

He also introduced improvements in agriculture. But, notwithstanding his many services, as he embraced the religion of Arminius, some of his flock became dissatisfied. At length, an <b>ecclesiastical</b> <b>council,</b> consisting of ten ministers, with their churches, sat upon him, and they, naturally enough, spoiled his usefulness. The council convened at the desire of two divine philosophers,--Joseph Doane and Nathaniel Freeman.|$|E
50|$|Synods of Westminster. Under this heading are {{included}} {{certain of the}} more important <b>ecclesiastical</b> <b>councils</b> held within the present bounds of London. Though the precise locality is occasionally uncertain, the majority of the medieval synods assembled in the chapter-house of old St Pauls, or the former chapel of St Catherine within the precincts of Westminster Abbey or at Lambeth. The councils were of various types, each with a constitutional history of its own. Before the reign of Edward I, when convocation assumed substantially its present form, there were convened in London various diocesan, provincial, national and legatine synods; during the past six centuries, however, the chief ecclesiastical assemblies held there have been convocations of the province of Canterbury.|$|R

These mingled sounds {{appeared}} to pass along the road, within a few yards of the young man's hiding-place; but, owing doubtless to the depth of the gloom at that particular spot, neither the travellers nor their steeds were visible. Though their figures brushed the small boughs by the wayside, it could not be seen that they intercepted, even for a moment, the faint gleam from the strip of bright sky athwart which they must have passed. Goodman Brown alternately crouched and stood on tiptoe, pulling aside the branches and thrusting forth his head as far as he durst without discerning so much as a shadow. It vexed him the more, because he could have sworn, were such a thing possible, that he recognized {{the voices of the}} minister and Deacon Gookin, jogging along quietly, as they were wont to do, when bound to some ordination or <b>ecclesiastical</b> <b>council.</b> While yet within hearing, one of the riders stopped to pluck a switch.|$|E
6000|$|But {{the men of}} less faith {{could not}} thus believe, and to such, concert appears the sole {{specific}} of strength. I have failed, and you have failed, but perhaps together we shall not fail. Our housekeeping is not satisfactory to us, but perhaps a phalanx, a community, might be. Many of us have differed in opinion, and we could find no man who could make the truth plain, but possibly a college, or an <b>ecclesiastical</b> <b>council</b> might. I {{have not been able}} either to persuade my brother or to prevail on myself, to disuse the traffic or the potation of brandy, but perhaps a pledge of total abstinence might effectually restrain us. The candidate my party votes for is not to be trusted with a dollar, but he will be honest in the Senate, for we can bring public opinion to bear on him. Thus concert was the specific in all cases. But concert is neither better nor worse, neither more nor less potent than individual force. All the men in the world cannot make a statue walk and speak, cannot make a drop of blood, or a blade of grass, any more than one man can. But let there be one man, let there be truth in two men, in ten men, then is concert for the first time possible; because the force which moves the world is a new quality, and can never be furnished by adding whatever quantities of a different kind. What is the use of the concert of the false and the disunited? There can be no concert in two, where there is no concert in one. When the individual is not individual, but is dual; when his thoughts look one way and his actions another; when his faith is traversed by his habits; when his will, enlightened by reason, is warped by his sense; when with one hand he rows and with the other backs water, what concert can be? ...|$|E

On the signature of the 1801 concordat, pope Pius VII and Napoleon I of France both demanded that the constitutional bishops and the remaining Ancien Régime bishops who had not sworn to uphold the Civil Constitution all resign their episcopal seats so that new holders could be appointed to the sees. 15 constitutional bishops refused to resign, feeling that their election to their episcopal seats were still valid (one such bishop, Henri Grégoire, signed himself as bishop of Loir-et-Cher right up until his death).|$|R
