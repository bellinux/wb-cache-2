5|$|French rule in {{the region}} was marked by the rapid {{implementation}} and extension of numerous reforms which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>passed</b> in post-Revolution France since 1789. Administration was organized under the French model, with meritocratic selection. Legal equality and state secularism were also introduced.|$|E

Remedial work took several months, but the aqueduct was still opened to traffic only 15 months after the enabling Act of Parliament <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>passed,</b> on 17 July 1761. It remained in use for more than 100 years, until the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal necessitated its demolition in 1893, replaced by the Barton Swing Aqueduct.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Barbera {{created his}} first solo-effort {{storyboard}} about a character named Kiko the Kangaroo. The storyline was of Kiko {{in an airplane}} race with another character called Dirty Dog. Terry declined to produce the story. In his autobiography, Barbera said of his efforts..."I was, quite honestly, {{not in the least}} disappointed. I had proven to myself that I could do a storyboard, and that I had gained the experience of presenting it. For now, that was enough."The original storyboard, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>passed</b> down through the Barbera family, went on sale at auction in November 2013.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Senator Roberts {{sponsored}} HB08-1157, a {{bill that}} sought to create a state legislative youth advisory council in Colorado.

5|$|The {{courts have}} rarely treated {{content-based}} regulation of journalism with any sympathy. In Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo (1974), the Court unanimously {{struck down a}} state law requiring newspapers criticizing political candidates to publish their responses. The state claimed that the law <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>passed</b> to ensure journalistic responsibility. The Supreme Court found that freedom, but not responsibility, is mandated by the First Amendment and so it ruled that the government may not force newspapers to publish that which they do not desire to publish.|$|E
5|$|The professions of architect, master craftsman, carpenter, and {{structural}} engineer {{did not have}} the high status of the Confucian scholar-officials during the dynastic era. Architectural knowledge <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>passed</b> down orally for thousands of years, usually from craftsman fathers to their sons. There were also government agencies and schools for construction, building, and engineering. The Song dynasty's building manuals aided not only the various private workshops, but also the craftsmen employed by the central government.|$|E
5|$|The professions of the architect, craftsman, carpenter, and {{structural}} engineer were {{not seen as}} professionally {{equal to that of}} a Confucian scholar-official. Architectural knowledge <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>passed</b> down orally for thousands of years in China, in many cases from a father craftsman to his son. Structural engineering and architecture schools were known to have existed during the Song period; one prestigious engineering school was headed by the renowned bridge-builder Cai Xiang (1012–1067) in medieval Fujian province.|$|E

5|$|After the {{supporters}} of Henry III of England suppressed opposition from the English nobility in the Second Barons' War, Henry granted to his second son Edmund Crouchback the titles and possessions forfeited by attainder of the barons' leader, Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, including the Earldom of Leicester, on 26 October 1265. Later grants included the first Earldom of Lancaster on 30 June 1267 and that of Earl Ferrers in 1301. Edmund was also Count of Champagne and Brie from 1276 by right of his wife. Henry IV of England would later use his descent from Edmund to legitimise his claim to the throne, even making the spurious claim that Edmund was the elder son of Henry but <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>passed</b> over as king because of his deformity.|$|E
5|$|Andorra {{has been}} a co-principality since the signing of a paréage in 1278, when the count of Foix and the bishop of La Seu d'Urgell agreed to share {{sovereignty}} over the landlocked country. After {{the title of the}} count of Foix <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>passed</b> to the kings of Navarre, and after Henry of Navarre had become Henry IV of France, an edict was issued in 1607 which established the French head of state as the legal successor to the count of Foix in regard to the paréage. Andorra was annexed by the First French Empire together with Catalonia in 1812–1813. After the Empire's demise, Andorra became independent again. The current joint monarchs are Bishop Joan Enric Vives Sicília and President Emmanuel Macron of France.|$|E
5|$|During the 1968 Democratic Convention, {{a motion}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>passed</b> to {{establish}} a commission to reform the Democratic Party nomination process. In 1969, McGovern was named chair of the Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection, {{also known as the}} McGovern–Fraser Commission; due to the influence of former McCarthy and Kennedy supporters on the staff, the commission significantly reduced the role of party officials and insiders in the nomination process, increased the role of caucuses and primaries, and mandated quotas for proportional black, female, and youth delegate representation. A somewhat unintended consequence of the commission's reforms was a massive {{increase in the number of}} presidential primaries; this became true for the Republican Party as well. The U.S.presidential nominating process has been different ever since, with scholars and politicians debating whether all the changes are for the better.|$|E

5|$|In 294, Narseh, {{a son of}} Shapur who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>passed</b> {{over for}} the Sassanid succession, {{came to power in}} Persia. Narseh {{eliminated}} Bahram III, a young man installed in the wake of Bahram II's death in 293. In early 294, Narseh sent Diocletian the customary package of gifts between the empires, and Diocletian responded with an exchange of ambassadors. Within Persia, however, Narseh was destroying every trace of his immediate predecessors from public monuments. He sought to identify himself with the warlike kings Ardashir (r. 226–41) and Shapur I (r. 241–72), who had defeated and imprisoned Emperor Valerian (r. 253–260) following his failed invasion of the Sasanian Empire.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} years of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era that followed, Congress {{repeatedly}} debated the rights of the millions of black former slaves. By 1869, amendments <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>passed</b> to abolish slavery and provide citizenship and equal protection under the laws, but the election of Ulysses S. Grant to the presidency in 1868 convinced a majority of Republicans that protecting the franchise of black male voters was important for the party's future. On February 26, 1869, after rejecting more sweeping versions of a suffrage amendment, Congress proposed a compromise amendment banning franchise restrictions on the basis of race, color, or previous servitude. After surviving a difficult ratification fight, the amendment was certified as duly ratified and part of the Constitution on March 30, 1870.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jackson's {{father had}} been {{appointed}} to command Northern Command in May 1940 and was promoted to major general in July. However, the following year he was posted to Western Command and believed that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>passed</b> over for a combat command after opposing the Brisbane Line strategy, subsequently retiring in early 1942. By late 1942 Jackson's battalion returned from the Middle East, and he later served in New Guinea fighting the Japanese at Gona, {{as well as in}} the Ramu Valley, the Finisterre Ranges and the New Guinea north coast. He was subsequently posted to Headquarters 18th Brigade as a major during the period 1943–44. In June 1944, he took up a position as an instructor at the Canadian Staff College in Kingston, where he remained until the end of the war.|$|E
