5|$|During {{the period}} of time of removal of thiomersal, the CDC and AAP asked doctors to delay the birth dose of <b>hepatitis</b> B vaccine in {{children}} not at risk for <b>hepatitis.</b> This decision, though following the precautionary principle, nevertheless sparked confusion, controversy and some harm. Approximately 10% of hospitals suspended the use of <b>hepatitis</b> B vaccine for all newborns, and one child born to a Michigan mother infected with <b>hepatitis</b> B virus died of it. Similarly, a study found that the number of hospitals who failed to properly vaccinate infants of <b>hepatitis</b> B seropositive mothers rose by over 6 times. This is a potential negative outcome given the high probability that infants who acquire <b>hepatitis</b> B infection at birth will develop the infection in a chronic form and possibly liver cancer.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{parasitic}} liver diseases may be {{risk factors}} as well. Colonization with the liver flukes Opisthorchis viverrini (found in Thailand, Laos PDR, and Vietnam) or Clonorchis sinensis (found in China, Taiwan, eastern Russia, Korea, and Vietnam) {{has been associated}} with the development of cholangiocarcinoma. Patients with chronic liver disease, whether in the form of viral <b>hepatitis</b> (e.g. <b>hepatitis</b> B or <b>hepatitis</b> C), alcoholic liver disease, or cirrhosis of the liver due to other causes, are at significantly increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma. HIV infection was also identified in one study as a potential risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma, although it was unclear whether HIV itself or other correlated and confounding factors (e.g. <b>hepatitis</b> C infection) were responsible for the association.|$|E
5|$|Chemotherapy {{can cause}} {{reactivation}} of <b>hepatitis</b> B, and doxorubicin-containing regimens are no exception.|$|E
5|$|In {{assisted}} reproductive technology, sperm washing is {{not necessary}} for males with <b>hepatitis</b> B to prevent transmission, unless the female partner has not been effectively vaccinated. In females with <b>hepatitis</b> B, the risk of transmission from mother to child with IVF {{is no different from}} the risk in spontaneous conception.|$|E
5|$|In {{clinical}} immunology, {{levels of}} individual classes of immunoglobulins are measured by nephelometry (or turbidimetry) {{to characterize the}} antibody profile of patient. Elevations in different classes of immunoglobulins are sometimes useful in determining the cause of liver damage in patients for whom the diagnosis is unclear. For example, elevated IgA indicates alcoholic cirrhosis, elevated IgM indicates viral <b>hepatitis</b> and primary biliary cirrhosis, while IgG is elevated in viral <b>hepatitis,</b> autoimmune <b>hepatitis</b> and cirrhosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{infectious}} disease <b>hepatitis</b> C {{is caused by}} the <b>hepatitis</b> C virus (HCV), which affects the liver and is transmitted by blood-to-blood contact, or by exposure to another person's infected blood. The infection is often asymptomatic, but chronic infection can cause inflammation of the liver (chronic <b>hepatitis).</b> This condition can progress to scarring of the liver (fibrosis), and advanced scarring (cirrhosis). In some cases, those with cirrhosis go on to develop liver failure or liver cancer.|$|E
5|$|Co-evolution {{hypothesis}} : This is {{also called}} the virus-first hypothesis and proposes that viruses may have evolved from complex molecules of protein and nucleic acid {{at the same time}} as cells first appeared on Earth and would have been dependent on cellular life for billions of years. Viroids are molecules of RNA that are not classified as viruses because they lack a protein coat. However, they have characteristics that are common to several viruses and are often called subviral agents. Viroids are important pathogens of plants. They do not code for proteins but interact with the host cell and use the host machinery for their replication. The <b>hepatitis</b> delta virus of humans has an RNA genome similar to viroids but has a protein coat derived from <b>hepatitis</b> B virus and cannot produce one of its own. It is, therefore, a defective virus. Although <b>hepatitis</b> delta virus genome may replicate independently once inside a host cell, it requires the help of <b>hepatitis</b> B virus to provide a protein coat so that it can be transmitted to new cells. In similar manner, the sputnik virophage is dependent on mimivirus, which infects the protozoan Acanthamoeba castellanii. These viruses, which are dependent on the presence of other virus species in the host cell, are called satellites and may represent evolutionary intermediates of viroids and viruses.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hepatitis</b> C is an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} <b>hepatitis</b> C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. Occasionally a fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin occurs. The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or dilated {{blood vessels in the}} esophagus and stomach.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hepatitis</b> C {{is caused}} by an RNA virus. In 80% of people infected, the disease becomes chronic, and they remain {{infectious}} {{for the rest of}} their lives unless they are treated. There is an effective treatment that uses the nucleoside analogue drug ribavirin combined with interferon. Treatments for chronic carriers of the <b>hepatitis</b> B virus by a similar strategy using lamivudine and other anti-viral drugs have been developed. In both diseases, the drugs stop the virus from reproducing and the interferon kills any remaining infected cells.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hepatitis</b> C {{is caused}} by an RNA virus. In 80% of people {{infected}}, the disease is chronic, and without treatment, they are infected {{for the remainder of}} their lives. However, there is now an effective treatment that uses the nucleoside analogue drug ribavirin combined with interferon. The treatment of chronic carriers of the <b>hepatitis</b> B virus by using a similar strategy using lamivudine has been developed.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{dysfunction}} as {{a result}} of malaria is uncommon and usually only occurs in those with another liver condition such as viral <b>hepatitis</b> or chronic liver disease. The syndrome is sometimes called malarial <b>hepatitis.</b> While it has been considered a rare occurrence, malarial hepatopathy has seen an increase, particularly in Southeast Asia and India. Liver compromise in people with malaria correlates with a greater likelihood of complications and death.|$|E
5|$|One such {{success is}} related to {{identifying}} the genetic variant associated with response to anti-hepatitis C virus treatment. For genotype 1 <b>hepatitis</b> C treated with Pegylated interferon-alpha-2a or Pegylated interferon-alpha-2b combined with ribavirin, a GWA study has shown that SNPs near the human IL28B gene, encoding interferon lambda 3, are associated with significant differences {{in response to the}} treatment. A later report demonstrated that the same genetic variants are also associated with the natural clearance of the genotype 1 <b>hepatitis</b> C virus. These major findings facilitated the development of personalized medicine and allowed physicians to customize medical decisions based on the patient's genotype.|$|E
5|$|Potential {{antiviral}} therapies include topical microbicide {{treatments that}} use RNAi to treat infection (at Harvard Medical School; in mice, so far) by {{herpes simplex virus}} type 2 and the inhibition of viral gene expression in cancerous cells, knockdown of host receptors and coreceptors for HIV, the silencing of <b>hepatitis</b> A and <b>hepatitis</b> B genes, silencing of influenza gene expression, and inhibition of measles viral replication. Potential treatments for neurodegenerative diseases have also been proposed, with particular attention to polyglutamine diseases such as Huntington's disease.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses {{can cause}} lifelong or chronic infections where the viruses {{continue}} to reproduce {{in the body}} despite the host's defence mechanisms. This is common in <b>hepatitis</b> B virus and <b>hepatitis</b> C virus infections. People chronically infected with a virus are known as carriers. They serve as important reservoirs of the virus. If {{there is a high}} proportion of carriers in a given population, a disease is said to be endemic.|$|E

5|$|The <b>hepatitis</b> {{research}} {{was instrumental in}} determining a virus {{is responsible for the}} disease and that it is transmitted through human filth, serum and drinking water.|$|E
5|$|Those at {{high risk}} of {{infection}} should be tested as there is effective treatment for those who have the disease. Groups that screening is recommended for include those who have not been vaccinated and one of the following: people from areas of the world where <b>hepatitis</b> B occurs in more than 2%, those with HIV, intravenous drug users, {{men who have sex with}} men, and those who live with someone with <b>hepatitis</b> B.|$|E
5|$|Vaccines for the {{prevention}} of <b>hepatitis</b> B have been routinely recommended for babies since 1991 in the United States. The first dose is generally recommended within a day of birth.|$|E
25|$|Viral <b>hepatitis</b> is {{the most}} common type of <b>hepatitis</b> worldwide. Viral <b>hepatitis</b> is caused by five {{different}} viruses (<b>hepatitis</b> A, B, C, D, and E). <b>Hepatitis</b> A and <b>hepatitis</b> E behave similarly: they are both transmitted by the fecal–oral route, are more common in developing countries, and are self-limiting illnesses that do not lead to chronic <b>hepatitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>hepatitis</b> D virus {{requires}} {{that a person}} first be infected with <b>hepatitis</b> B virus, so prevention efforts should focus on limiting the spread of <b>hepatitis</b> B. In people who have chronic <b>hepatitis</b> B infection and {{are at risk for}} superinfection with the <b>hepatitis</b> D virus, the preventive strategies are the same as for <b>hepatitis</b> B.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hepatitis,</b> {{specifically}} <b>hepatitis</b> B and <b>hepatitis</b> C infection, {{and primary}} biliary cirrhosis.|$|E
25|$|Unlike <b>hepatitis</b> B, {{most cases}} of <b>hepatitis</b> C lead to chronic infection. <b>Hepatitis</b> C {{is the second}} most common cause of {{cirrhosis}} in the US (second to alcoholic <b>hepatitis).</b> In the 1970s and 1980s, blood transfusions were a major factor in spreading <b>hepatitis</b> C virus. Since widespread screening of blood products for <b>hepatitis</b> C began in 1992, the risk of acquiring <b>hepatitis</b> C from a blood transfusion has decreased from approximately 10% in the 1970s to 1 in 2 million currently.|$|E
25|$|The <b>hepatitis</b> D virus causes chronic and fulminant <b>hepatitis</b> in {{the context}} of co-infection with the <b>hepatitis</b> B virus. It is {{primarily}} transmitted via non-sexual contact and via needles. Susceptibility to <b>hepatitis</b> D differs by geographic region. In the United States and Northern Europe, populations at risk are intravenous drug users and individuals who receive multiple transfusions. In the Mediterranean, <b>hepatitis</b> D is predominant among <b>hepatitis</b> B virus co-infected individuals.|$|E
25|$|Chronic <b>hepatitis</b> B. The <b>hepatitis</b> B virus causes liver {{inflammation}} and injury that over several decades {{can lead to}} cirrhosis. <b>Hepatitis</b> D {{is dependent on the}} presence of <b>hepatitis</b> B and accelerates cirrhosis in co-infection.|$|E
25|$|In this pattern, {{hepatocellular}} necrosis {{is associated with}} infiltration of inflammatory cells. There can be three types of drug-induced <b>hepatitis.</b> (A) viral <b>hepatitis</b> is the most common, where histological features are similar to acute viral <b>hepatitis.</b> (B) in focal or non-specific <b>hepatitis,</b> scattered foci of cell necrosis may accompany lymphocytic infiltration. (C) chronic <b>hepatitis</b> {{is very similar to}} autoimmune <b>hepatitis</b> clinically, serologically, and histologically.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hepatitis</b> D infections can {{transform}} benign cases of <b>hepatitis</b> B into severe, progressive <b>hepatitis,</b> a {{phenomenon known as}} superinfection.|$|E
25|$|Fulminant <b>hepatitis,</b> or massive hepatic cell death, is a {{rare and}} {{life-threatening}} complication of acute <b>hepatitis</b> that can occur in cases of <b>hepatitis</b> B, D, and E, in addition to drug-induced and autoimmune <b>hepatitis.</b> The complication more frequently occurs in instances of <b>hepatitis</b> B and D co-infection {{at a rate of}} 2–20% and in pregnant women with <b>hepatitis</b> E at rate of 15–20% of cases. In addition to the signs of acute <b>hepatitis,</b> people can also demonstrate signs of coagulopathy (abnormal coagulation studies with easy bruising and bleeding) and encephalopathy (confusion, disorientation, and sleepiness). Mortality due to fulminant <b>hepatitis</b> is typically the result of various complications including cerebral edema, gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis, respiratory failure, or kidney failure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hepatitis</b> B and C {{can present}} either acutely or chronically. <b>Hepatitis</b> D is a {{defective}} virus that requires <b>hepatitis</b> B to replicate {{and is only}} found with <b>hepatitis</b> B co-infection. In adults, <b>hepatitis</b> B infection is most commonly self-limiting, with less than 5% progressing to chronic state, and 20 to 30% of those chronically infected developing cirrhosis or liver cancer. However, infection in infants and children frequently leads to chronic infection.|$|E
25|$|Most {{patients}} who acquire <b>hepatitis</b> D {{at the same}} time as <b>hepatitis</b> B (co-infection) recover without developing a chronic infection; however, in people with <b>hepatitis</b> B who later acquire <b>hepatitis</b> D (superinfection), chronic infection is much more common at 80-90%, and liver disease progression is accelerated.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} cause {{worldwide}} is viruses. Other causes include heavy alcohol use, certain medications, toxins, other infections, autoimmune diseases, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). There are five main types of viral hepatitis: type A, B, C, D, and E. <b>Hepatitis</b> A and E are mainly spread by contaminated food and water. <b>Hepatitis</b> B is mainly sexually transmitted, but may also be passed from mother to baby during pregnancy or childbirth. Both <b>hepatitis</b> B and <b>hepatitis</b> C are commonly spread through infected blood such as may occur during needle sharing by intravenous drug users. <b>Hepatitis</b> D can only infect people already infected with <b>hepatitis</b> B.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hepatitis</b> {{can also}} occur in {{neonates}} and {{is attributable to}} a variety of causes, some of which are not typically seen in adults. Congenital or perinatal infection with the <b>hepatitis</b> viruses, toxoplasma, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and syphilis can cause neonatal <b>hepatitis.</b> Structural abnormalities such as biliary atresia and choledochal cysts can lead to cholestatic liver injury leading to neonatal <b>hepatitis.</b> Metabolic diseases such as glycogen storage disorders and lysosomal storage disorders are also implicated. Neonatal <b>hepatitis</b> can be idiopathic, and in such cases, biopsy often shows large multinucleated cells in the liver tissue. This disease is termed giant cell <b>hepatitis</b> and may be associated with viral infection, autoimmune disorders, and drug toxicity.|$|E
25|$|People with <b>hepatitis</b> {{should avoid}} taking drugs metabolized by the liver. Glucocorticoids are not {{recommended}} {{as a treatment}} option for acute viral <b>hepatitis</b> and may even cause harm, such as development of chronic <b>hepatitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Investigations into {{potential}} {{transmission of}} HIV, MRSA, <b>hepatitis</b> B, <b>hepatitis</b> C, and <b>hepatitis</b> E {{have not found}} any evidence that bed bugs can spread these diseases. However, arboviruses may be transmissible.|$|E
25|$|Excessive alcohol {{consumption}} {{is a significant}} cause of <b>hepatitis</b> and {{is the most common}} cause of cirrhosis in the U.S. Alcoholic <b>hepatitis</b> is within the spectrum of alcoholic liver disease. This ranges in order of severity and reversibility from alcoholic steatosis (least severe, most reversible), alcoholic <b>hepatitis,</b> cirrhosis, and liver cancer (most severe, least reversible). <b>Hepatitis</b> usually develops over years-long exposure to alcohol, occurring in 10 to 20% of alcoholics. The most important risk factors for the development of alcoholic <b>hepatitis</b> are quantity and duration of alcohol intake. Long-term alcohol intake in excess of 80 grams of alcohol a day in men and 40 grams a day in women is associated with development of alcoholic <b>hepatitis</b> (1 beer or 4 ounces of wine is equivalent to 12g of alcohol). Alcoholic <b>hepatitis</b> can vary from asymptomatic hepatomegaly (enlarged liver) to symptoms of acute or chronic <b>hepatitis</b> to liver failure.|$|E
25|$|Unlike <b>hepatitis</b> A and B, {{there is}} {{currently}} no vaccine to prevent <b>hepatitis</b> C infection.|$|E
25|$|Both drug-induced <b>hepatitis</b> and {{autoimmune}} <b>hepatitis</b> {{can present}} very similarly to acute viral <b>hepatitis,</b> with slight variations in symptoms {{depending on the}} cause. Cases of drug-induced <b>hepatitis</b> can manifest with systemic signs of an allergic reaction including rash, fever, serositis (inflammation of membranes lining certain organs), elevated eosinophils (a type of white blood cell), and suppression of bone marrow activity.|$|E
