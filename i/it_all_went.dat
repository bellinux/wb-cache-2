25|$|There was {{no change}} {{after the first}} two matches as Gloucestershire beat Glamorgan in two days and Middlesex won the {{difficult}} encounter at Derby. <b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>went</b> wrong for Gloucestershire at Dean Park, Bournemouth where stubborn Hampshire batting forced a draw while Middlesex were defeating Surrey with some ease. This gave Middlesex a twenty-point lead and only two matches each to be played. Middlesex's victory over the bottom team Northants settled it, especially as Gloucestershire surprisingly lost to Sussex by nine wickets. Even so, {{there was a slight}} sting in the tail as Middlesex then lost their final match to a determined Lancashire by 64 runs while Gloucestershire rallied to defeat Essex. The final table showed Middlesex winning by twenty points, {{on the face of it}} a handsome margin, but in reality it was a much closer contest than the figures would suggest.|$|E

Foster saw Inside Man as an opportunity to collaborate with Lee: [...] "Spike is somebody who always fascinated me, and I've loved his movies. I've always wanted to be involved in something he's making. Basically, I never thought I would because it didn't seem like his stories or subject matter were ever going to include me. So, I'm just as excited as I can be." [...] She described her character as a woman with [...] "a relaxed kind of witty quality to her. All the while being very strong, not having to raise her voice very much, not having to yell at anybody — she's got authority. There's seductiveness, a charm, if you will, to her ability to get into people's psyches that's been immensely fun to play. <b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>went</b> way too fast for me." ...|$|E
500|$|Mileena's {{addition}} to the series was well received and she quickly {{became one of the}} most popular and recognizable Mortal Kombat characters. Her debut appearance in Mortal Kombat II was met with a favorable critical reception: The Miami Herald called Kitana and Mileena, [...] "leggy ladies who wear masks", an [...] "interesting step toward political correctness" [...] as [...] "a far cry from Little Miss Muffet," [...] Austin American-Statesman described them as [...] "far nastier than that martial-artless aerobics instructor from the first game," [...] while Nintendo Power called her [...] "beautiful, graceful, beguiling and strong, but most of all, deadly." [...] Some publications regarded her as the symbol of the game, including Consoles+ and Video & Games that each positioned her as an equivalent of, respectively, Cammy and Ryu from Super Street Fighter II. In the early 2010s, a retrospective article by IGN's Richard George listed [...] "the hot chicks" [...] as one of the reasons why Mortal Kombat II [...] "is considered by many to be the pinnacle of the series," [...] and UGO named [...] "the busty ninja sisters Kitana and Mileena" [...] as front characters of the Mortal Kombat franchise. GamesRadar UK wrote, [...] "we had two nigh-identical twins of svelte, slinky sex and gore...But then Milly took off her mask and <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>went</b> wrong.

500|$|Author Dorothy Hobson has {{discussed}} {{the use of}} older female characters in British soap opera {{as a means of}} providing comedy. She compares Ethel and Dot's function in EastEnders to the trio of Ena Sharples, Minnie Caldwell and Martha Longhurst from Coronation Street with regard to providing humour. She has noted that following Ethel's retirement from the serial, the production team at EastEnders attempted to replicate Dot and Ethel's friendship by introducing a number of [...] "'friends' to fulfill the same function of a female friend for Dot and the series." [...] An example of this was the character Lilly Mattock (Barbara Keogh) who appeared between 1998 and 1999. [...] The author goes on to note that Ethel's role in Dot's narrative was difficult to replace because [...] "far from being complete stereotypes, their relationships depend on them being long-standing friends with the ability to share stories and reminisce. For the characters to 'work', {{there is a need for}} unspoken intimacy and a shared knowledge for each other's lives. They carry the internal knowledge of the narratives and share that knowledge with the audience." [...] Brown has spoken about the [...] "wonderful rapport" [...] she had with Gretchen Franklin who played Ethel. She added, [...] "I do miss Ethel, it was great with Dot and Ethel. They did try and stop us working together at one time, but the producer changed and <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>went</b> back to where it started." ...|$|E
2500|$|Durham Dynamos {{continued}} their perfect {{start to the}} season with an emphatic win at Chester-le-Street. Surrey Lions chose to bowl first, and Tim Murtagh with 3 for 12 performed well. But Dale Benkenstein and Gordon Muchall put on 100 together to help the Dynamos to 224 for 8. For the Lions <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>went</b> wrong between the sixth and eighth overs, during which they lost four wickets for two runs to plummet to 27 for 4. Liam Plunkett and Benkenstein took 4 wickets each as Surrey were dismissed for 86 in 30.1 overs. It's early in the season, but already Surrey are looking weak after their fourth successive match without a victory.|$|E
2500|$|Dettori commented [...] "What an {{unbelievable}} day. I was excited {{at the big}} job ahead of me, but <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>went</b> like clockwork from start to finish. When you're young, you don't really appreciate the full importance of this Derby, so it means {{a great deal to}} win it for a second time. I've had a colourful life, but I'm not finished". Before the race Dettori had requested some [...] "lucky white tape" [...] for his stirrup: the tape had previously been used to repair Willie Carson's saddle before his win on Nashwan and had been applied to Dettori's stirrup when he won on Authorized in 2007. Gosden, who was winning the race for the second time, after Benny the Dip's success in 1997, commented [...] "The last thing I said to Frankie was ride a cool race and he rode a cool race—he waited and waited. He's a proper horse." [...] On the following day Gosden indicated that the Eclipse Stakes would be the colt's most likely next target.|$|E

2500|$|For Pet Sounds, Wilson {{desired to}} make [...] "a {{complete}} statement", {{similar to what}} he believed the Beatles had done with their newest album Rubber Soul, released in December 1965. Wilson was immediately enamored with the album, given the impression {{that it had no}} filler tracks, a feature that was mostly unheard of at a time when 45rpm singles were considered more noteworthy than full-length LPs. Many albums up until the mid-1960s lacked a cohesive artistic goal and were largely used to sell singles at a higher price point. Wilson found that Rubber Soul subverted this by having a wholly consistent thread of music. Inspired, he rushed to his wife and proclaimed, [...] "Marilyn, I'm gonna make the greatest album! The greatest rock album ever made!" [...] He would say of his reaction to Rubber Soul: [...] "I liked the way <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>went</b> together, the way it was all one thing. It was a challenge to me... It didn't make me want to copy them but {{to be as good as}} them. I didn't want to do the same kind of music, but on the same level." ...|$|E

[...] Also {{attending}} from the OPJHL were the Cobourg Cougars as hosts and the Brampton Capitals as OPJHL finalists. [...] Cobourg lost to the Thunder Bay Flyers 5-3, defeated the Rayside-Balfour Sabrecats 5-3, before losing to both Newmarket and Brampton. [...] Newmarket defeated Rayside-Balfour 4-3, Cobourg 3-1, lost to Brampton, and then Thunder Bay 3-2. [...] The Capitals were undefeated in the round robin, defeating Thunder Bay 5-2, Rayside-Balfour 10-6, Newmarket 6-3, and Cobourg 9-3. [...] All three OPJHL teams made the tournament's semi-finals. [...] In the first semi-final, Brampton defeated Cobourg 5-2, while Newmarket beat Thunder Bay 6-3. [...] This results in a rematch of the OPJHL final in the Dudley Hewitt Cup final. [...] The Newmarket 87's crushed Brampton 8-2. [...] Next, Newmarket flew out to Melfort, Saskatchewan to compete in the Royal Bank Cup 1996. [...] In their first game they defeated the BCHL's Vernon Vipers 7-5, then the SJHL's Yorkton Terriers 5-2. [...] <b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>went</b> downhill from there as the 87's then lost to the host Melfort Mustangs 11-3, the MJAHL's Moncton Beavers 4-3, and were defeated in the semi-final by Vernon 7-4. [...] This ended the OPJHL's first odyssey in the Royal Bank Cup.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between Steve Hewitt {{and the rest}} of the band had become tense during the recording of Meds and eventually, in October 2007, the band announced that Hewitt was no longer in Placebo. Molko commented that [...] "Being in a band is very much like being in a marriage, and in couples—in this case a triple—people can grow apart over the years. To say that you don't love your partner anymore is inaccurate, considering all that you've been through and achieved together. There simply comes a point when you realise that you want different things from your relationship and that you can no longer live under the same roof, so to speak". Olsdal commented [...] "We couldn't go on with Steve Hewitt. We didn't have the same goals, nor the same vision anymore. We had to separate. <b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>went</b> wrong during the Meds tour. [...] There was no communication between us. Brian and I are one, but at some point we even didn't talk to each other anymore. We realised Placebo was dying. To be able to go on, things had to change." [...] According to Hewitt, [...] "Alex Weston, our manager, [...] called me in to the office and said I was not in the band anymore. And that's it. I was thrown out". Hewitt claims that it was [...] "very hurtful" [...] and [...] "disappointing" [...] to have been ejected in this way after being in the band for over a decade. Early in 2008 Hewitt founded the band Love Amongst Ruin, switching to guitar and singing lead vocals. In August 2012 he became the drummer of the reformed Six by Seven.|$|E

2500|$|Wilson has said: [...] "The Beatles {{inspired}} me. They didn't influence me." [...] While he was {{enamored with}} Rubber Soul, he explained: [...] "I {{liked the way}} <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>went</b> together, {{the way it was}} all one thing. It was a challenge to me... It didn't make me want to copy them but {{to be as good as}} them. I didn't want to do the same kind of music, but on the same level." [...] Carl elaborated: [...] " [...] was Brian's favorite kind of rock; he liked [...] better than the early Beatles stuff. He loved the Beatles' later music when they evolved and started making intelligent, masterful music, but before that Phil was it." [...] According to Mike Love, Carl followed the Beatles more closely than anyone else in the group, but Brian was the most [...] "rattled" [...] by the Beatles, feeling tremendous pressure to [...] "keep pace" [...] with them. Brian once characterized himself as [...] "fucked up" [...] and [...] "jealous" [...] of Spector and the Beatles, saying; [...] "i was flipping out. I couldn't understand how [...] could be just yelled and screamed at. The music they made, 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' for example, wasn't even that great a record, but they just screamed at it." [...] On another occasion, he's said that he was overwhelmed by the [...] "electricity" [...] of their voices on the song ("It really turned me on"). He recalled that he and Love immediately felt threatened by the Beatles and added that he knew the Beach Boys could never match the excitement created by the Beatles as performers, and that this realization led him to concentrate his efforts on trying to outdo them in the recording studio.|$|E
2500|$|In April, {{the sisters}} decided to flat {{together}} but trouble arose with Brooke's flatmate's Bella Cooper (Amelia Reid) and Luke Durville (Gerald Urquhart) refusing to move out. Brooke ended up manipulating the two into relationship problems {{to get them}} out but ultimately helped the two and was at odds with Bree's antagonistic view of the couple. Brooke and Bree's mother Annette (Louise Wallace) returned in July 2012 and the cast enjoyed portraying the relationship between the mother and her illegitimate daughter, with Wallace stating: [...] "It's good looking at the back story and what happened in our relationship and where <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>went</b> wrong, why she hates me and why I don't give a rats arse about her. We are deeply flawed." [...] She went on to state that Annette would have never; [...] "anticipated having to deal with this part of her past, so it throws her a real curveball when she arrives and discovers Bree has firmly entrenched herself in Brooke's life" [...] and that; [...] "In some ways, Bree and Annette are more similar than Brooke and Annette, which really riles Annette." [...] Following her lack of respect from Annette, Bree held her captive and mentally tortured her. She decided that life would be easier as Brooke and started to adopt her personality, [...] "All she really wants is acceptance and love and, as we're seeing now, she's finding a way for that to happen by adopting Brooke's persona." [...] The storyline was compared to films: Fatal Attraction and Single White Female, though Blampied tried not to be influenced by them. The storyline climaxed in Bree, under the identity of Brooke, attempting to murder her sister and hiding her body in a storage container. Vinnie realised something was wrong and a search party soon found Brooke. Bree tried to escape but was mown down by a forklift. After finally accepting what she had done was wrong, Bree tried to make up with Brooke but ended up being sectioned to a psychiatric ward.|$|E
