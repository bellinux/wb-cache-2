50|$|As decades passed, {{firefighting}} technology advanced, and Austin's buildings grew taller. In the 1960s, snorkel trucks {{gave the}} city's firefighters access to higher windows {{than could be}} reached with traditional ladders, and the tower's value as a training facility declined. At the same time, {{the growth of the}} city meant that the <b>drill</b> <b>tower,</b> originally built near the southern edge of town, was now crowded by tall modern buildings and heavy traffic, making the training fires a growing hazard to downtown. Finally, in 1974 the fire department opened a new training tower in southeast Austin, and the original Fire <b>Drill</b> <b>Tower</b> was closed.|$|E

50|$|After Massey Shaw's departure, it {{was decided}} to {{separate}} the Police and Fire Brigade, with George Reilly being appointed the fire brigade's first superintendent, serving in this position until 1891. In 1892, after Reilly's retirement, the Belfast Corporation sought to fulfil a long planned restructuring of the brigade which saw a move from a semi-professional to a fully professional Fire Brigade. Under the leadership of Superintendent George Parker, who formerly held the position of Chief Fire Officer in Bootle, Liverpool, he sought to introduce new items of protective uniform and equipment. Other major changes which occurred at this time included the phasing out of auxiliary firemen, alterations to working rotas and leave entitlements, along with reviewed rates of pay. In May 1894 the new Belfast Fire Brigade headquarters and fire station in Chichester Street opened. The premises incorporated; fire station, headquarters offices, dwelling houses to provide accommodation for firemen and their families, accommodation for single firemen, and a paved drill yard and 130-foot tall <b>drill</b> <b>tower.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Bellevue became {{incorporated}} in 1953 {{and the police}} department was created by City Ordinance #8 on April 28, 1953.Chief G.L. [...] "Jerry" [...] Plowman was appointed as Chief of Police. By May 1953, staff included four officers (Chief Plowman, Sgt. George Whitman, and Officers Bob Sollitto and Jack Allen), and service was 24 hours per day. The first police headquarters was located at Chief Plowman's house in the Surrey Downs neighborhood, where calls would be taken and the porch light turned on to notify Chief Plowman to stop by for orders. Police headquarters was moved to a rented space in the old V.F.W. hall, and in 1954 an old school at 100th Avenue and Main Street became the new home of the City of Bellevue. During the Department's formative years, surrounding departments, including the King County Police and the Washington State Patrol, helped the new staff at BPD to get started, {{and the city of}} Kirkland rented space in their jail for Bellevue to use in 1954. By 1955, the population of Bellevue was 9,000, and there were 10 Officers working for the Department. In October 1960, the Department moved into new quarters at 106th Avenue NE and NE 8th Street. By 1962, the population of Bellevue was 14,700, with Department personnel numbering 22 sworn officers. In 1963, the Department had its first dispatch center. In 1964, the Department moved to 116th Avenue SE and Main Street, where it remained until 2006. In 1965, the Department created a traffic division, and assigned 5 officers to Traffic enforcement duties. Also in 1965, Bellevue experienced its first homicide. In 1968, Bellevue had 49 sworn officers. That same year the college incentive program was offered. By 1970, the city, through annexation, grew to be the 4th largest city in the state of Washington, and the Department had 92 personnel. In 1971 the Department formed the vice and narcotics detail, as well as the harbor patrol. In 1972, the rank of Sergeant was eliminated with the move to combine the Police and Fire Departments into one department. The potential merger drew intense criticism and was eventually scrapped, but the Sergeant's position was never reinstated, and first line supervisors in the Department remain Lieutenants. In 1973, the department grew to 106 personnel, including 26 civilian personnel. In May of that year, one person was killed and another injured by the [...] "Bellevue sniper." [...] The sniper was apprehended and later convicted for homicide. In June 1975, the Department entered into a new phase of policing called [...] "team policing" [...] in which Officers worked more closely with the community than they had in the past. In order to meet the increased demands in the patrol section, 10 new positions were added in 1981. The city's public safety training center became a reality in 1983. The training facility houses a firing range, exercise facility, classrooms, <b>drill</b> <b>tower,</b> and K-9 area, as well as a large paved parking lot which is used for motorcycle officer training and recertification. The decade between 1975 and 1984 saw many advances and changes with the Department. During those years the crime prevention unit was formed, uniformed officers took a greater role in investigations, the Tactical Arms Group was formed, and the crime analysis unit was formed. 1986 saw the beginning of the Crime Scene Investigator (CSI) role. 7 officers received the initial training, which involved crime scene and evidence processing. CSI officers gather evidence at major crime scenes, resulting in faster and more thorough crime scene processing. In 1990 there were 144 Police Officers in Bellevue. A 1991 survey of Bellevue Residents found that 85.7 percent of respondents reported feeling very safe or moderately safe in their neighborhoods. Also in 1991 there were, {{for the first time in}} nearly two decades, no fatal traffic collisions. The first citizens academy graduated in 1992, and has been an important community outreach program that continues to this day. In 1994 and 1995, the Department went through several changes, including the opening of the Factoria substation, the initiation of a summer park patrol program, and the receipt of a Federal grant which added 4 officers to the Department. In September 1997 the Department began the School Resource Officer (SRO) program, placing Officers in each of Bellevue's 4 high schools. In 1998 the traffic division was moved under the umbrella of the patrol section, and the Department also formed its honor guard that year. The Department moved into the new Bellevue City Hall located at 450 110th Avenue NE in April 2006.|$|E

40|$|The ISTUK deep drill was {{developed}} in 1978 - 1980. The drill is mechanical. The cuttings are sucked from the bits into storage chambers in the drill, and brought to the surface with each core increment (typically 2. 4 m in length). Because the actual drilling time is {{a fraction of the}} total run time, with most of the time spent going {{up and down in the}} drill hole, much emphasis has been placed on reducing the friction in the hole and in reducing the time consumed on the surface. In order to simplify the drilling operation, the steel drill cable uses only one wire with the armour acting as power return. Also, to enhance the reliability of the drilling, most drill control tasks are taken care of by a down borehole processor. The drill was first used during 1979 - 1981 at Dye- 3 in south Greenland, and lately during 1990 - 1992 at Summit, central Greenland. The Summit drill is physically the same as the Dye- 3 drill however, the motor section has been replaced, as have the high-pressure gaskets. The cutters and the core catchers are basically the same, but the angles have been changed slightly. The electronics are new, although the functions performed are unchanged. The winch and the tilting tower are both of new construction and use an electronic variable frequency inverter to drive a standard 3 -phase electrical motor. A load transducer is built into the center bolt of the sheave in the <b>drill</b> <b>tower.</b> The readout from this transducer indicates the cable load with high resolution...|$|E
