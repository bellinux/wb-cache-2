5|$|Feynman was a keen popularizer {{of physics}} through both books and lectures, {{including}} a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom, and the three-volume {{publication of his}} undergraduate lectures, The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Feynman also became known through his semi-autobiographical books Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and What <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Care</b> What Other People Think? and books written about him, such as Tuva or Bust! and Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman by James Gleick.|$|E

500|$|Feynman devoted {{the latter}} half of his book What <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Care</b> What Other People Think? to his {{experience}} on the Rogers Commission, straying from his usual convention of brief, light-hearted anecdotes to deliver an extended and sober narrative. Feynman's account reveals a disconnect between NASA's engineers and executives that was far more striking than he expected. His interviews of NASA's high-ranking managers revealed startling misunderstandings of elementary concepts. For instance, NASA managers claimed that there was a 1 in 100,000 chance of a catastrophic failure aboard the shuttle, but Feynman discovered that NASA's own engineers estimated the chance of a catastrophe at closer to 1 in 200. He concluded that NASA management's estimate of the reliability of the space shuttle was unrealistic, and he was particularly angered that NASA used it to recruit Christa McAuliffe into the Teacher-in-Space program. He warned in his appendix to the commission's report (which was included only after he threatened not to sign the report), [...] "For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled." ...|$|E

To insure {{your own}} safety you sent {{him on a}} desperate, unworthy mission--to worm {{his way into the}} confidence of a drunkard, to steal for you, to be your jackal. What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>care</b> what the consequences might be! What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>care,</b> so long as your own reputation and wealth were saved! He was to be one other--my poor Basil--one other of those to be crushed beneath the great wheels!" ...|$|R

2500|$|In 2012, the Catholic Church {{directly}} {{intervened in}} government plans in Croatia to introduce sex education teaching in schools (including {{the topic of}} homosexuality). Several parishes distributed leaflets at local Mass asking: [...] "Parents, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>care</b> {{about the fact that}} your child will have to learn that a homosexual act is as natural and valuable as a sexual act {{between a man and a}} woman?" [...] Subsequently the teaching was suspended by Constitutional Court on the grounds that parents had the right to freely decide about the education of their children.|$|E
2500|$|David Hockney {{perceives}} {{music as}} color, shape, and configuration and uses these perceptions when painting opera stage sets (though not while creating his other artworks). Kandinsky combined four senses: color, hearing, touch, and smell. Nabokov described his grapheme-color synesthesia at length in his autobiography, Speak, Memory, and portrayed {{it in some}} of his characters. In addition to Messiaen, whose three types of complex colors are rendered explicitly in musical chord structures that he invented, other composers who reported synesthesia include Duke Ellington, Rimsky-Korsakov, and Jean Sibelius. Michael Torke is a contemporary example of a synesthetic composer. Physicist Richard Feynman describes his colored equations in his autobiography, What <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Care</b> What Other People Think? ...|$|E

60|$|THE SERPENT. Life {{must not}} cease. That comes before everything. It is silly to say <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not <b>care.</b> <b>You</b> <b>do</b> <b>care.</b> It is that care that will prompt your imagination; inflame your desires; make your will irresistible; and create out of nothing.|$|R

What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>care</b> whether you see anybody again or not? You want to be amused. And now you're irritated because you think I {{am not going to}} amuse you any more: and you don't know who is going to amuse you. I admit it's a dilemma.

6000|$|... "Why?" [...] she asked. [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> want me {{to marry}} <b>you?</b> <b>You</b> <b>do</b> not <b>care</b> for me. <b>You</b> <b>do</b> not <b>care</b> for me at all. Is it because I am rich? But you--you are rich yourselves. I would offer you my money, but you cannot want that." ...|$|R
6000|$|She sank to {{the floor}} and threw her arms about his knees, sobbing. [...] "And <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>care</b> for me. <b>You</b> <b>do</b> <b>care</b> for me. Think! The long years I have waited, suffered! You can never know!" [...] He stooped and raised her to her feet.|$|R
