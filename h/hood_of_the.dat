5|$|The video {{begins as}} Rihanna, scantily dressed and wearing fishnet stockings, stands against a {{convertible}} {{car in a}} desert. Timberlake, wearing a leather jacket and black jeans, arrives on a motorcycle. He unbuttons his jacket to cool down and bathes in pink-colored water before greeting Rihanna at her Airstream trailer. The pair then climb onto the <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vintage car. In the next scene, Timberlake plays a guitar while lying on a large rocket. Throughout the video, Timberlake and Rihanna vary their poses from sultry to defensive.|$|E
25|$|Cambridge: Prior to admission, {{undergraduates}} {{wear their}} College undergraduate gown with the <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highest degree {{they are about}} to receive, graduates with degrees from other universities wear the BA/MA status gown with the <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highest degree {{they are about to}} receive and graduates already possessing Cambridge degrees wear the gown and <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highest degree they currently possess. After the ceremony day, they would wear the correct gown and hood for their new degree. During the ceremony they would kneel in front of the Vice-Chancellor or their deputy (who always wears the cope) with the hands closed together whilst the VC encloses the graduand's hands between their own and admits them with a Latin formula.|$|E

25|$|A simple rounded <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{early years}} of the century evolved into the French hood, popular in both France and England; its arched shape sat further back on the head and {{displayed}} the front hair which was parted in the center and pinned up in braids or twists under the veil.|$|E
25|$|Taxicabs in Chicago, Illinois, are {{operated}} by private companies and {{licensed by the}} city. There are about seven thousand licensed cabs operating within the city limits.

25|$|The {{original}} <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DeLorean had grooves {{running down}} both sides. It included a gas flap to simplify fuel filling. The gas flap was built {{so that the}} trunk could {{be added to the}} total cargo area of the DeLorean. These cars typically had a locking gas cap to prevent siphoning. In August 1981, the hood flap was removed from the <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cars (although the hood creases stayed). This style was retained well into 1982. Based on production numbers for all three years, this hood style is probably the most common. After the supply of locking gas caps was exhausted, the company switched to a non-locking version (resulting in at least 500 cars with no gas flap, but with locking gas caps). The final styling for the hood included the addition of a DeLorean name badge and the removal of the grooves, resulting in a completely flat hood. According to senior personnel who worked at the Dunmurry factory, initial elimination of gas flap hoods has a simple if unglamorous explanation—Chuck Benington, managing director, did not like the gas flap design.|$|E

25|$|Notwithstanding these facts, {{there is}} a belief amongst some Muslims – {{particularly}} though not entirely exclusively in (sub-Saharan) Africa – that female circumcision (specifically the cutting of the prepuce or <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clitoris) is religiously vindicated by {{the existence of a}} handful of ḥadīths which apparently recommend it. However, these ḥadīths are generally regarded as inauthentic, unreliable and weak, and therefore as having no legislative foundation and/or practical application.|$|E
25|$|Always an {{independent}} person, Irene {{was thrilled to}} receive a sports car from her father, one of the gifts he had been presented with. Irene's happiness was short-lived; {{when she opened the}} <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> automobile, she noticed that the car was sporting in appearance only, having an ordinary car's engine. She asked her father for permission to turn the vehicle into a true racing-type auto, which Prince Bernhard refused to allow.|$|E
25|$|The next {{notice is}} a {{statement}} in the Scotichronicon, composed by John of Fordun between 1377 and 1384, and revised by Walter Bower in about 1440. Among Bower's many interpolations is a passage that directly refers to Robin. It is inserted after Fordun's account of the defeat of Simon de Montfort and the punishment of his adherents. Robin is represented as a fighter for de Montfort's cause. This was in fact true of the historical outlaw of Sherwood Forest Roger Godberd, whose points of similarity to the Robin <b>Hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ballads have often been noted.|$|E

Awesome sent Bigelow into the ringsteps, and Bigelow sent Awesome through a table with a back body drop.

25|$|Menard {{returned}} to the 27 for 2014, with the car running schemes more oriented towards the associate sponsors of MENARDS featured on the <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car. Six races prior to the Chase for the Sprint Cup at Indy in July, Menard was involved in an incident with part-time driver Juan Pablo Montoya, sending Menard into the turn 3 wall and relegating him to a 34th-place finish. The incident upset both driver and crew, who felt Montoya had cost them {{a spot in the}} Chase (Menard was dropped to 16th in points). After the fall Richmond race, Menard remained winless and ranked 20th in points, losing out on a spot in the new chase format.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of Medical {{students}} completing their clinical years graduands wear the gown and <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> B.Chir degree. This {{is due to the}} fact the B.Chir degree is conferred in absentia as soon as the list of people passing the Final M.B examination is posted outside Senate House. This was to prevent the necessity for a 'double graduation' ceremony. As such it is common practice for students to hire the B.Chir academic dress, rather than purchase it, for it is superseded by the M.B academic dress post graduation. In {{the case of}} students who have completed both pre-clinical and clinical years at Cambridge, many alumni and graduates do not purchase the M.B academic dress, merely hiring it for any occasions requiring academic dress (Alumni Formal Hall etc.) as this is superseded a mere couple of years later when the automatic Oxbridge MA is granted. Medical students graduate at the end of the third year with a Cambridge BA, and for this ceremony are treated as any other students graduating with a BA.|$|E

500|$|During the Battle of the Yellow Sea in August 1904, Fuji was not damaged {{because the}} Russian ships {{concentrated}} their fire on Tōgō's flagship, the battleship , which {{was leading the}} column.
