[...] Plummer wanted to imbue the character with irony, an element he found to be absent from the novel's Henrik. [...] "I think that the old man would have it," [...] he opined, [...] "because he's a very sophisticated old guy [...] used to a great deal of power.

500|$|In 1907, {{journalist}} Lindsay Denison {{complained that}} Sunday preached [...] "the old, old doctrine of damnation", getting results by [...] "inspiring fear and gloom {{in the hearts}} of sinners."In spite of his conviction that the truly religious man should take his religion joyfully, <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>his</b> results by inspiring fear and gloom {{in the hearts of}} sinners.

But Sunday himself told reporters [...] "with ill-concealed annoyance", that his revivals had [...] "no emotionalism." [...] Certainly contemporary comparisons to the extravagances of mid-nineteenth-century camp meetings—as in the famous drawing by George Bellows—were overdrawn. Sunday told one reporter that he believed that people could [...] "be converted without any fuss," [...] and, at Sunday's meetings, [...] "instances of spasm, shakes, or fainting fits caused by hysteria were few and far between." ...|$|E
