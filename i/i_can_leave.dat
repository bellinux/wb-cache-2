2500|$|Wang Yi {{was spared}} from {{disaster}} when Liang Shuang reconciled {{with the authorities}} in Qiangdao County. Zhao Ang sent his men to fetch his wife and daughter. When they were about 30 li away from their destination, Wang Yi suddenly stopped and said to Zhao Ying, [...] "I'd have never left that place if your father didn't send someone to fetch us. Whenever I read the stories of Lady Jiang and Lady Bo, I feel inspired by their devotions and convictions. However, I'm still alive after having gone through similar experiences as them, so wouldn't I feel ashamed when I face those ladies after I die? I didn't choose death then because of you. Now, since we're close to safety and within {{the protection of the}} authorities, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> you and die." [...] Having said that, she attempted suicide by consuming poison but luckily for her, an antidote was available, so she received medical treatment quickly and survived.|$|E
6000|$|... "Brave man!" [...] cried Rob, laughingly; [...] "you've {{avoided the}} pangs of {{starvation}} for a time, anyhow, so <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> {{you with a}} clear conscience." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} our friend knows her, and our name {{is not on the}} hotel book. There is a Cuban lady <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> her with." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have seen}} the meaning and purport of Altruria so clearly," [...] I said, [...] "that <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> safely <b>leave</b> you to guess {{the answer to that}} question." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Sir,’ resumed the prince, {{turning to}} the young man, ‘I cannot help you; my help would but unchain the {{thunderbolt}} that overhangs you; and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> but <b>leave</b> you free.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't understand," [...] {{he cried}} {{in a voice}} that was meant to be great and resolute, and which broke. [...] "You are blind, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see. <b>Leave</b> me alone!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you,' said Albinia, 'some evening perhaps I may come, since yon are so kind, but I don't think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> {{this poor}} twisted arm to itself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well! I {{will think}} of what you said, Peter Ivanovitch. I shall try to call as soon as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> mother {{for an hour or}} two safely." ...|$|E
6000|$|Foster {{told him}} and he nodded. [...] "I know the inn and will call there as soon as <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> <b>Leave</b> your address if you go before I come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] resumed the prince, {{turning to}} the young man, [...] "I cannot help you; my help would but unchain the {{thunderbolt}} that overhangs you; and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> but <b>leave</b> you free." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here. <b>I</b> believe <b>I</b> <b>can</b> get <b>leave</b> from Saturday till Tuesday. If <b>I</b> <b>can</b> get {{a hearing}} in those two days, I shall try; and depend upon it, Grace, this place is the worst that Rachel can be in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{consider}} {{you in a}} {{very hopeful}} condition, Miss Kilburn, and I feel that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> safely <b>leave</b> you to Mrs. Munger. She is coming to see {{you as soon as}} she gets back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, it's {{just how}} you look at it. But if you'll give me six months, I'll work it so that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> without being ashamed to look others in the face." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have just}} joined {{the navy and}} am bound for the Brooklyn. But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> you my uncle's name and address, and he can come on to Boston from Buffalo, if it's necessary." ...|$|E
6000|$|George {{will have}} the title and his laurels; my property, (if any is [...] left in five years time,) <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> to whom I please, and your son [...] shall be the legatee. Adieu.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, let me lower {{you down}} to the ground, and seat you as comfortably as <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> <b>I</b> will <b>leave</b> these bananas by you, and my flask of water. It is lucky, now, that I did not drink it all when I started to cross the river.|$|R
6000|$|He laughed. [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> safely <b>leave</b> {{his case}} in your hands. Don't {{go to the}} other extreme. If she married a German, he would let her black his boots,--like that general in Munich." ...|$|R
6000|$|So, {{an octave}} struck the answer. Oh, they praised you, I dare say! [...] "Brave Galuppi! that was music! good alike at grave and gay! <b>I</b> <b>can</b> always <b>leave</b> off talking when I hear a master play!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think his}} majesty is quite right," [...] he said, [...] "and tonight <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> the palace after dark and {{cross the border}} some time {{tomorrow}} evening. The people need never know the truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{shall not}} quarrel," [...] {{for a third}} time the {{stranger}} interrupted. [...] "You have been very considerate to me as it is. I feel, Mrs. Pennycherry, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> myself entirely in your hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll make it do. If {{we run out}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> {{you with}} the turnout, {{and come back to}} New York and buy more, and have it shipped as freight to the nearest {{railroad}} station." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then the Bishop said, 'After this, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only <b>leave</b> it to {{your own}} {{conscience}} whether you ought to keep this book; but I think you would do wisely to let me know, remembering that I have no authority in the school.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To have a {{nice little}} room, and make flowers, like a French girl I know. It's such pretty work, and she gets lots of money, for every one likes her flowers. She shows me how, sometimes, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do <b>leaves</b> first-rate; but--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Say, what <b>can</b> <b>I</b> do for thee? weary thee, grieve thee? [...] Lean on thy shoulder, new burdens to add? [...] Weep {{my tears}} over thee, making thee sad? [...] Oh, hold me not--love me not! let me {{retrieve}} thee. [...] I love thee so, Dear, that <b>I</b> only <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> thee.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is more to}} tell before <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> {{the dead}} man to his rest. I have {{described}} the finding of his body. But I have not described {{the circumstances under which}} he met his death.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was in this}} way. [...] "Mamma," [...] said Augusta, [...] "I suppose <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> a lot {{of things}} in the big wardrobe. Jemima says I cannot take them to Merle Park without ever so many extra trunks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do know. Ask his friends. You may {{state that}} I'm {{an old man}} and am unable to go to him. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> you to strike the right note; you have some talent {{for that kind of}} thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{there is}} nothing to delay me. <b>I</b> suppose we <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> the house by paying the rent? I will go and do what you want." ...|$|R
60|$|I shall {{therefore}} merely {{state the}} circumstances which {{led up to}} this sad event as concisely and as plainly as <b>I</b> <b>can,</b> and <b>leave</b> every reader to draw his own deductions. Perhaps {{there may be some}} one who can throw light upon what is dark to me.|$|R
60|$|I {{come next}} {{to speak of}} the manner of his death and the {{consequences}} thereof, which are, indeed, very surprising, and, perhaps, not altogether unworthy a general observation. I shall relate them as briefly as <b>I</b> <b>can,</b> and <b>leave</b> every one to believe or disbelieve as he thinks proper.|$|R
6000|$|... "No;--don't do that. I'll go {{in my own}} cart. I'll make my man {{get hold}} of my groom and manage it somehow. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> my things and you can bring them. Only say to-morrow that I was obliged to go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{propose to}} do nothing. I think that I {{have done all}} my duty requires, and that now <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> the whole affair to you. It was your affair in the beginning. I don't see why I should worry myself about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think that's what I meant," [...] he said. [...] "You are {{in charge}} of our {{transport}} and I expect he'll need a quantity of food and prospecting tools sent up into the bush. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> you to work out details." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{the strangest}} {{incident}} of all I have not told you yet--feeling some hesitation {{about the best}} way of describing it, so as to interest you in what has deeply interested me. I must tell it as plainly as <b>I</b> <b>can,</b> and <b>leave</b> it to speak for itself.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{too much}} of a speech for Kate to answer; but she nestled up to him, and felt as if she loved him more than ever. He added, [...] "I should like to see Mr. Wardour, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hardly <b>leave</b> your aunt yet. Would he come to London?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I declare," [...] said he, [...] "Corny {{must keep}} out of the water. It {{seems to me that}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> never <b>leave</b> her but she gets into some scrape. But I'm sure our friends here have proved {{themselves}} good fellows, indeed," [...] and he shook hands with both of us.|$|R
