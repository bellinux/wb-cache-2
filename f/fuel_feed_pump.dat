3000|$|Coal-based {{electric}} power generation remains the basic source of obtaining energy. With increasing pressure to reduce CO 2 emissions, improving power unit efficiency has become an issue of utmost significance. Surely, one of the possibilities to improve the efficiency of new power units is raising the steam parameters. With improved power plant efficiency, there is a lower demand for power of almost all auxiliary equipment except the boiler <b>feed</b> <b>pump.</b> The {{reason for this is}} that the power needed to drive the <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> is an almost linear function of the steam pressure. This means that, even though the steam mass flow (and, consequently, the feed water mass flow) is reduced and the efficiency of <b>feed</b> <b>pumps</b> is improved, their power increases. For this reason, it is very important to find the optimum drive of the boiler <b>feed</b> <b>pump.</b> The main aim of the conducted analysis was to compare various drive options of the boiler <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> for a conceptual ultra-supercritical 900 -MW steam power unit.

30|$|Improving a {{power unit}} {{efficiency}} {{results in a}} reduction in fuel and steam consumption per unit which involves {{a reduction in the}} mass flow of burned <b>fuel,</b> <b>feed</b> water and other combustion products: slag and ash. The expansion of regenerative systems and the raising of feed water temperature additionally result in reducing the mass flow of the main condensate and of the mass flow of the water cooling the condenser. Generally, an effect of an increase in the steam parameters is a decreased demand for power to satisfy the needs of most facilities. However, there is a greater need in terms of the power with which the <b>feed</b> water is <b>pumped.</b> Since the power of the boiler <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> is an almost linear function of the live steam pressure despite a reduction in the unit steam consumption and the feed water consumption, as well as an improvement in the efficiency of the pump itself, its share in the total demand for power to satisfy own needs increases substantially.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: There are {{clinically}} relevant {{discrepancies between}} prescribed volumes and delivered volumes of enteral nutrition (EN) {{in intensive care}} unit (ICU) patients. Next to EN-protocol violations due to insufficient care, we hypothesized technical factors to be responsible for this deficit. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the accuracy of EN <b>feeding</b> <b>pump</b> systems frequently used in the ICU. METHODS: Thirteen commercially available EN <b>feeding</b> <b>pumps</b> with their own delivery systems were tested in 12 sessions with different EN feeding tubes and EN formulas in a laboratory setting. The reproducibility of the measurements was determined for the 8 best performing EN <b>feeding</b> <b>pump</b> systems. RESULTS: There were clinically important differences between prescribed volumes and delivered volumes of EN in the tested EN <b>feeding</b> <b>pump</b> systems. The deficit in volume ranged from + 66 mL (surplus of 66 mL) to - 271 mL (deficit of 271 mL) per 24 hours (14 % of prescribed volume). Viscosity of test fluids (water/EN feeding formulas) and resistance of test tubes had no influence on the delivered volume by the tested EN <b>feeding</b> <b>pump</b> systems, because differences between prescribed volumes and delivered volumes were consistently found for each system while varying these test settings.

40|$|Abstract- <b>Feed</b> <b>pumps</b> are an {{essential}} subsystem of boilers used in industrial process plants and called as boiler <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> (BFP). Normally, BFP is high pressure unit that takes suction from condensate return system {{and can be}} of the centrifugal type pump. In centrifugal pump, water enters axially through the impeller eyes and exits radially. Generally, electric motor is used as prime mover to run the <b>feed</b> <b>pump.</b> To force water into boiler, the pump must generate sufficient pressure to overcome steam pressure developed by boiler. In the present study, design and analysis of boiler <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> having a flow of 2000 m 3 /hr, head of 470 m and operating at 130 ± 10 o C has been taken up. The various pump parameters are obtained from design and pump model is developed using modelling software Creo Parametric. To evaluate the results at given operating conditions, CFD analysis is carried out using Ansys CFX module. Blade number has great influence on the pump performance. Therefore, CFD analyses are carried out for the pump with 5, 6 and 7 blades. Based on performance of every pump model, the best <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> design is selected. A steady state CFD analysis is carried out using the K-ε turbulence model to solve for the Navier-Stroke’s equation. Keywords- <b>feed</b> <b>pump,</b> pump design, CFD analysis, pump performance.

30|$|Under a {{low load}} of the unit, the steam mass {{flow through the}} {{low-pressure}} turbine is usually not big enough which causes the danger of {{a substantial increase in}} the temperature of the blades.

This may cause mechanical problems because the turbine driving the boiler <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> was designed for lower parameters of the incoming steam.

30|$|An {{interesting}} option {{could be}} {{the implementation of the}} ‘master cycle’ (MC) solution patented by the company Elsam Engineering (Fredericia, Denmark), which consists in shifting all the intermediate-pressure turbine bleeds to an auxiliary extraction-backpressure turbine referred to as ‘tuning turbine’ which is also fed with the steam from the high-pressure turbine outlet [7, 8, 9]. The auxiliary turbine drives the main boiler <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> and, optionally, an auxiliary generator which could carry away the power surplus generated by the system to the unit transformer through separate, additional primary coils. During the start-up or holdup of the unit, the ‘synchro-self-shifting’ clutch is open and the auxiliary turbine does not work. The auxiliary generator is switched to motor operation and drives the main <b>feed</b> <b>pump,</b> which renders the start-up <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> driven by an electric motor unnecessary. The use of an additional generator on a single shaft together with the pump and the turbine would require revolution control to maintain a steady speed {{on the part of the}} generator.|$|R

30|$|Condensing {{turbines}} {{to drive}} boiler <b>feed</b> <b>pumps</b> are usually fed with the steam from the outlet of the intermediate-pressure turbine or steam from the intermediate-pressure turbine bleeds, {{and they give}} steam to the main or additional condenser.
