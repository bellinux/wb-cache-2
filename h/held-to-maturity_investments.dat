40|$|The Islamic {{bonds or}} sukuk market {{is one of}} the fastest growing {{segments}} of the nearly US$ 2 trillion global Islamic finance industry. However, lack of trading in secondary sukuk markets is a peculiar feature in this sector and both institutional and retail sukuk investors are known to adopt a held-to-maturity investment strategy. Consequently, there is a critical gap in literature in studying the portfolio diversification opportunities available to sukuk investors and evaluating these in the light of held-to-maturity strategies. This paper (using recently available data and continuous wavelet transform methodologies) has made an initial attempt to study the portfolio diversification strategies for Islamic bond (sukuk) portfolios across heterogeneous investment horizons using the Malaysian and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) sukuk markets as a case study. Our findings critically indicate that returns between local currency sukuk in different markets have low levels of long-term correlations, thus enabling portfolio diversification benefits. However, international currency sukuk issued in different markets exhibit high levels of long-term correlations which impede portfolio diversification benefits for <b>held-to-maturity</b> <b>investments.</b> A similar impediment is also witnessed in the domestic market context where diversification is intended by investing in different types of domestic sukuk. Overall, our findings critically highlight the feasibility of held-to-maturity sukuk investment strategies from a portfolio diversification perspective. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{about the}} adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) by the Nigerian financial institutions. Nigeria have been using domestic accounting standard (NGAAP) for banks and non-banks financial institutions known as Statement of Accounting Standards (SAS 10 Part 1 and SAS 15 Part 2) issued in 1990 and 1997 respectively for financial reporting. These domestic standards were adopted from International Accounting Standards (IAS 30) but have not been updated like IAS 30 {{as reported by the}} Report on Observance of Standard Codes (ROSC) of Nigeria in 2004 and 2011. The change in accounting regulations is {{as a result of the}} weaknesses of NGAAP and low disclosure requirements. IFRS reporting has more disclosures than NGAAP especially for financial institutions. Under NGAAP financial instruments have not been classified as in IFRS. For instance, financial instruments have been classified into four under IAS 39 as; (i) recognised fair value on gain or loss in profit or loss, (ii) are measured at amortised cost for <b>investments</b> <b>held-to-maturity,</b> (iii) measured at amortised cost for loans and receivables, (iv) measured at fair value gain or loss for available-for-sale financial assets recognised in other comprehensive income. Additionally, financial liabilities have been categories into two namely; (i) measured at amortised fair value on financial liabilities through profit or loss and, (ii) measured at amortised other liabilities. Now with the mandatory adoptions of reporting under IFRS by all listed financial institutions, will the accounting disclosures be more valu...|$|R
