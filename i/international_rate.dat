40|$|Motivated by the Chinese experience, we analyze a semi-open economy {{where the}} central bank has access to {{international}} capital markets, but the private sector has not. This enables {{the central bank}} to choose an interest rate different from the <b>international</b> <b>rate.</b> We examine the optimal policy of the central bank by modelling it as a Ramsey planner who can choose the level of domestic public debt and of international reserves. The central bank can improve savings opportunities of credit-constrained consumers modelled as in Woodford (1990). We find that in a steady state it is optimal for the central bank to replicate the open economy, i. e., to issue debt financed by the accumulation of reserves so that the domestic interest rate equals the foreign rate. When {{the economy is in}} transition, however, a rapidly growing economy has a higher welfare without capital mobility and the optimal interest rate differs from the <b>international</b> <b>rate.</b> We argue that the domestic interest rate should be temporarily above the <b>international</b> <b>rate.</b> We also find that capital controls can still help reach the first best when the planner has more fiscal instruments...|$|E
40|$|In 1922, British colonial Gambia demonetized the French 5 -franc coin, {{which had}} been legal tender at a fixed rate in the colony since 1843. Until World War I, this rate {{was close to the}} <b>international</b> <b>rate</b> under the gold standard. When the franc began to {{depreciate}} in 1918, however, a gap emerged between the Gambian rate and the <b>international</b> <b>rate,</b> prompting a rapid influx of the coins. The demonetization cost the colonial administration over a year's revenue, affecting the later development of the colony. The 1920 s have long been a fruitful period for the study of monetary history owing to the instability of exchange rates during and after the war. This article extends the study of this period to examine the impact of these changes on dependent colonies in West Africa, highlighting the importance of local compromises and particularities in colonial monetary systems...|$|E
