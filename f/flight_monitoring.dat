25|$|Phased array radars {{have been}} in use since the {{earliest}} years of radar in World War II (Mammut radar), but electronic device limitations led to poor performance. Phased array radars were originally used for missile defence (see for example Safeguard Program). They are {{the heart of the}} ship-borne Aegis Combat System and the Patriot Missile System. The massive redundancy associated with having a large number of array elements increases reliability at the expense of gradual performance degradation that occurs as individual phase elements fail. To a lesser extent, Phased array radars have been used in Weather Surveillance. As of 2017, NOAA plans to implement a national network of Multi-Function Phased array radars throughout the United States within 10 years, for meteorological studies and <b>flight</b> <b>monitoring.</b>|$|E

40|$|The Dryden Flight Research Facility of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center (Ames-Dryden) is the {{principal}} NASA facility for the flight testing and evaluation of new and complex avionics systems.

50|$|The Department of Conservation {{has noted}} that {{aircraft}} noise and activity in the Sound are often remarked on by tourists as being unexpectedly substantial (even more so on the nearby Milford Track). DOC is therefore encouraging the use of larger and less noisy aircraft. In 2007, flight restrictions were announced, {{limiting the number of}} flights in the Fiordland area and the number of operators to 2004-2005 levels via a concession system, with 23 licenses only (the number of operators in 2004-2005). Operators are also required to pay for <b>flight</b> <b>monitoring,</b> and further restrictions may be declared if more than 25% of National Park visitors consider the aircraft noise annoying.

5000|$|...The {{introduction}} of heavy bombers with four engines brought {{the necessity of}} engine management and a new trade entered service with these aircraft."Flight Engineer" [...] chosen specifically for mechanical aptitude the Flight Engineer sat beside the pilot and assisted him particularly at take off, during the <b>flight</b> <b>monitoring</b> the engines and vitally the fuel efficiency pumping fuel between the tanks as required. It was not unusual for these airmen {{to be a little}} older than their colleagues and often had prior mechanical experience. The flight engineer was usually a sergeant, promotion was very slow indeed. A Flight Engineer wore a single-winged aircrew brevet with a wreath containing the letter 'E' on his tunic, above his left breast pocket denoting his trade specialization. During the initial operational service of four-engined bombers second pilots were carried until sufficient flight engineers had been trained.The original trade of Observer began to be phased out although those airmen who had qualified in that role early in the war continued to wear their O brevet with great pride. It was replaced by two new trades. [...] "Navigator" [...] who worked at his desk behind a curtain and instructed the pilot on route and airspeed required throughout the operation in order to arrive on target within the expected time period in company with the other aircraft due to attack, he operated any radar navigational aids carried aboard. A Navigator wore a single-winged aircrew brevet with a wreath containing the letter N on his tunic, above his left breast pocket denoting his trade specialization. At this stage of the war pilots and navigators were often commissioned on completion of training.|$|E

40|$|Lightweight {{aircraft}} design emphasizes {{the reduction of}} structural weight to maximize aircraft efficiency and agility {{at the cost of}} increasing the likelihood of structural dynamic instabilities. To ensure flight safety, extensive flight testing and active structural servo control strategies are required to explore and expand the boundary of the flight envelope. Aeroservoelastic (ASE) models can provide online <b>flight</b> <b>monitoring</b> of dynamic instabilities to reduce flight time testing and increase flight safety. The success of ASE models is determined by the ability to take into account varying flight conditions and the possibility to perform <b>flight</b> <b>monitoring</b> under the presence of active structural servo control strategies. In this continued study, these aspects are addressed by developing specific methodologies and algorithms for control relevant robust identification and model validation of aeroservoelastic structures.
