40|$|Change is afoot in the Michelle Smith Performing Arts Library. Most of {{you know}} that our former Head, Connie Mayer, retired back in November {{to return to her}} home state of Minnesota to be closer to family. With Connie's departure, I was asked to serve as Interim Head. I also {{continue}} to serve as Music Librarian, so please keep those purchase requests, reference questions, and classroom invitations coming. I will pass along information about plans for a permanent head as it becomes available. MSPAL staff and I are dedicated to continuing the work Connie began to serve and inspire performing artists and researchers. We are committed to collaborating with the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center to build the future of the arts at the University of Maryland. Our (your!) collections, spaces, and services will continue to change to meet your evolving needs. I am looking forward to 2014 being a year to think big about future directions for the library and we want your advice. See "New Year, New MSPAL " in this newsletter for details on all the ways you can tell us what you think. In addition, look <b>for</b> opportunities <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> {{over the course of the}} year through focus groups, brown bags, and the formation of a new MSPAL advisory group. In addition to gathering feedback, we will also be moving forward on some initiatives we know will be appreciated...|$|R
