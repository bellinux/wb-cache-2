5|$|Kaminsky {{stands up}} Incanto while he waits at a restaurant. He leaves, murdering a {{slightly}} overweight prostitute who injures {{him in a}} struggle. Incanto is forced to flee before he can fully dissolve the body. At the autopsy, Scully finds that the body's airways are choked with the same substance that dissolved Lauren. The State Genetic Lab report reveals that the skin under the victim's nails contains no oils or fatty acids, convincing Mulder that the killer is sucking body <b>fat</b> <b>from</b> his victims.|$|E
5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. The {{incoming}} material, food, enters {{the body and}} is concocted into blood; waste is excreted as urine, bile, and faeces, and the element fire is released as heat. Blood is made into flesh, the rest forming other earthy tissues such as bones, teeth, cartilages and sinews. Leftover blood is made into fat, whether soft suet or hard lard. Some <b>fat</b> <b>from</b> all around the body is made into semen.|$|E
5|$|During {{a routine}} liposuction {{operation}} in Winnetka, Illinois, Dr. Harrison Lloyd (John Juliani) suddenly begins to remove so much <b>fat</b> <b>from</b> a patient {{that the patient}} dies. Following the unusual experience, Lloyd tells Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) that he killed the patient because he was possessed. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is skeptical about Lloyd's claims, believing he's only making it up to escape legal consequences. Mulder inspects the operation room and discovers a pentagram burned into the floor; he begins to suspect that witchcraft might have {{played a part in}} the crime. Meanwhile, the staff at Lloyd's clinic are shocked when another plastic surgeon, Dr. Ilaqua (Paul Raskin), murders an elderly patient by burning a hole through her cheek and neck with a surgical laser, severing her brain stem. Scully interviews Ilaqua, who claims that he cannot remember anything of the incident. Mulder's suspicions are strengthened when he reviews the tape of the second murder, and he sees a pentagram-like pattern on the stomach of the victim.|$|E
50|$|The protein, as a {{component}} of HDL particles, enables efflux of fat molecules by accepting <b>fats</b> <b>from</b> within cells (including macrophages within the walls of arteries which have become overloaded with injested <b>fats</b> <b>from</b> oxidized LDL particles) for transport (in the water outside cells) elsewhere, including back to LDL particles or to the liver for excretion.|$|R

5|$|Two predatory lenders awaken {{on either}} side of a room split by a caged-in scale, wearing head {{harnesses}} with screws poised to pierce their temples. The one who sets more flesh weight upon their tray will survive. Eddie cuts <b>fat</b> <b>from</b> his torso, but Simone chops off her arm, and Eddie is killed when the timer expires. As he reviews the game's footage, Detective Lieutenant Mark Hoffman is called to the scene by FBI Agent Dan Erickson, who has found Peter Strahm's fingerprints. Also present is Lindsey Perez, whose survival was covered up by Erickson for her protection. They learn from Dr. Adam Heffner, the coroner who performed all of the autopsies for the case thus far, that the knife used to cut the jigsaw piece from Eddie's flesh was only used once before, on Seth Baxter. The agents intend to find the Baxter audio tape to prove Strahm's involvement.|$|E
5|$|Between 8 and 10 May 1926, regular {{elections}} to the Third Seimas were held. For {{the first time}} since 1920, the bloc led by the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, which strongly supported the Roman Catholic Church and its clergy, did not obtain a majority. The Lithuanian people were disillusioned with this party, as its members had been involved in several financial scandals: Juozas Purickas had been using his diplomatic privileges in Moscow to deal in cocaine and saccharin; Eliziejus Draugelis and Petras Josiukas had purchased cheap low-quality smoked pig <b>fat</b> <b>from</b> Germany instead of buying from Lithuanian farmers; and the Minister of Finance, Vytautas Petrulis, had transferred a large sum of money from the state budget to his personal account. The party's strategies for coping with an economic crisis were perceived as ineffective. An additional tension arose when the Concordat of 1925 between Poland and the Holy See unilaterally recognized Vilnius as an ecclesiastical province of Poland, despite Lithuanian requests to govern Vilnius directly from Rome. Although it was not traditionally a Vatican policy to establish an arrangement of this type, the decision was objected to strongly by many Lithuanians. The decision implied that the Pope had recognized Polish claims to Vilnius, and this created a loss of prestige for the Christian Democrats. Diplomatic relations with the Holy See were severed, and they did not improve when Pope Pius XI unilaterally established and reorganized Lithuanian ecclesiastical provinces in April 1926 without regard to Lithuanian proposals and demands.|$|E

50|$|French {{researchers}} such as Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Jean-Baptiste Boussingault {{believed that}} animals assimilated sugars, proteins, and <b>fats</b> <b>from</b> plant materials and lacked {{the ability to}} synthesize them. Liebig's work suggested a common ability {{of plants and animals}} to synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones. His experiments on fat metabolism convinced him that animals must be able to synthesize <b>fats</b> <b>from</b> sugars and starch. Other researchers built upon his work, confirming the abilities of animals to synthesize sugar and build fat.|$|R

2500|$|The US National Dairy Council has {{asserted}} that the trans fats present in animal foods are of a different type than those in partially hydrogenated oils, and {{do not appear to}} exhibit the same negative effects. While a recent scientific review agrees with the conclusion (stating that [...] "the sum of the current evidence suggests that the Public health implications of consuming trans <b>fats</b> <b>from</b> ruminant products are relatively limited"), it cautions that {{this may be due to}} the low consumption of trans <b>fats</b> <b>from</b> animal sources compared to artificial ones.|$|R

He revealed to the press that he and Jeter were no longer close friends. Rodriguez also reduced his high leg kick at the plate, increasing his bat speed, making him less-apt to strike out and a more dangerous hitter.|$|E
