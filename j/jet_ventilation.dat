Every temperature data gathered from simulation results has been verified with infrared camera figures taken at the company, thus contributing to reach reliable conclusions. As it is inferred from previous papers and empiric theory, the flow field observed is also justified. Then, thermal comfort and air quality analysis relies on consistent facts.

5000|$|High {{frequency}} <b>jet</b> <b>ventilation</b> (HFJV) {{is provided}} by the Bunnell Life Pulse High-Frequency Ventilator. HFJV employs an endotracheal tube adaptor in place for the normal 15 mm ET tube adaptor. A high pressure [...] "jet" [...] of gas flows out of the adaptor and into the airway. This jet of gas occurs for a very brief duration, about 0.02 seconds, and at high frequency: 4-11 hertz. Tidal volumes ≤ 1 ml/Kg are used during HFJV. This combination of small tidal volumes delivered for very short periods of time creates the lowest possible distal airway and alveolar pressures produced by a mechanical ventilator. Exhalation is passive. Jet ventilators utilize various I:E ratios—between 1:1.1 and 1:12—to help achieve optimal exhalation. Conventional mechanical breaths are sometimes used to aid in reinflating the lung. Optimal PEEP is used to maintain alveolar inflation and promote ventilation-to-perfusion matching. <b>Jet</b> <b>ventilation</b> has been shown to reduce ventilator induced lung injury by as much as 20%.

40|$|There is a {{new trend}} to convert the {{workplaces}} from individual office rooms to open offices for motivating money saving and better communication. With such a shift the ability of existing ventilation systems in meeting the new requirements is a challenging question for researchers. The available options could {{have an impact on}} workers' health in terms of providing acceptable levels of thermal comfort and indoor air quality. Thus, this experimental investigation focuses on the performances of three different air distribution systems in an open-plan office space. The investigated systems were: mixing ventilation with ceiling-mounted inlets, confluent <b>jets</b> <b>ventilation</b> and underfloor air distribution with straight and curved vanes. Although this represents a small part of our more extensive experimental investigation, the results show that all the purposed stratified ventilation systems (CJV and UFAD) were more or less behaving as mixing systems with some tendency for displacement effects. Nevertheless, it is known that the mixing systems have a stable flow pattern but has the disadvantage of mixing contaminated air with the fresh supplied air which may produce lower performance and in worst cases occupants' illness. For the open-plan office we studied here, it will be shown that the new systems are capable of performing better than the conventional mixing systems. As expected, the higher air exchange efficiency in combination with lower local mean age of air for corner-mounted CJV and floor-mounted UFAD grills systems indicates that these systems are suitable for open-plan offices and are to be favored over conventional mixing systems...|$|R

40|$|Maintaining {{a healthy}} cabin {{environment}} during flight relies on continual extraction {{of fresh air}} from the engine. To meet passengers' expectation for more comfortable cabin which requires improved air supply and address the ever critical energy and emissions concerns, novel air delivery methods inside the cabin are desired and, therefore, of practical significance. This study explores the effectiveness of jet oscillation using active flow control to improve air delivery inside a cabin. The pulsed jet and synthetic jet are selected among the various control techniques to provide the control excitations on the air supply condition based on a detailed review of current practices of cabin ventilation. CFD simulation is employed as the major method of studying cabin airflow while hotwire measurement and flow visualization are made to validate the modelling of the synthetic jet. The fresh air jet entering the cabin is seen to oscillate about its injection angle when the supply flow rate experiences a series of sudden changes. Such oscillatory motion enhances air exchange and improves the ventilation performance. Lower temperature and CO 2 level are achieved under the pulsed supply conditions compared with the conventional steady supply conditions. Longer period of oscillation is maintained with proper modulation of the pulsed supply signal. The improvement of ventilation performance indicators reach up to 10 % when the supply signal turns periodic. A compact speaker driven actuator is designed to form the synthetic jet for redirecting the cabin <b>ventilation</b> <b>jet,</b> which provides a more direct way of inducing air oscillation inside the cabin. Due to the constraint of the cabin ceiling, a single synthetic jet acting as a pulling effect {{is not able to}} fully deflect the attached <b>ventilation</b> <b>jet.</b> A secondary synthetic jet oriented perpendicular to the <b>ventilation</b> <b>jet</b> can be added to push the attached jet off the ceiling and causes the formation of a merged jet at a downstream distance with a deflected jet direction.

Calculations were performed on a high performance computer cluster using parallel version of Fire Dynamics Simulator.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Spontaneous ventilation, {{mechanical}} controlled ventilation, apneic intermittent ventilation, and <b>jet</b> <b>ventilation</b> {{are commonly}} used during interventional suspension microlaryngoscopy. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate specific complications of each technique, with special emphasis on transtracheal and transglottal <b>jet</b> <b>ventilation.</b> METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective single-institution analysis of a case series of 1, 093 microlaryngoscopies performed in 661 patients between January 1994 and January 2004. Data were collected from two separate prospective databases. Feasibility and complications encountered with each technique of ventilation were analyzed as main outcome measures. RESULTS: During 1, 093 suspension microlaryngoscopies, ventilation was supplied by mechanical controlled ventilation via small endotracheal tubes (n = 200), intermittent apneic ventilation (n = 159), transtracheal <b>jet</b> <b>ventilation</b> (n = 265), or transglottal <b>jet</b> <b>ventilation</b> (n = 469). Twenty-nine minor and 4 major complications occurred. Seventy-five percent of the patients with major events had an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification of III. Five laryngospasms were observed with apneic intermittent ventilation. All other 24 complications (including 7 barotrauma) occurred during <b>jet</b> <b>ventilation.</b> Transtracheal <b>jet</b> <b>ventilation</b> was associated with a significantly higher complication rate than transglottal <b>jet</b> <b>ventilation</b> (P < 0. 0001; odds ratio, 4. 3 [95 % confidence interval, 1. 9 - 10. 0]). All severe complications were related to barotraumas resulting from airway outflow obstruction during <b>jet</b> <b>ventilation,</b> most often laryngospasms. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a transtracheal cannula was the major independent risk factor for complications during <b>jet</b> <b>ventilation</b> for interventional microlaryngoscopy.
