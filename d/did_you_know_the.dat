60|$|MY DEAR COUSIN,--When you {{offered me}} money assistance, little did I think I should want it so soon. A rascal of a haberdasher, to whom I owe a {{considerable}} bill, taking {{it into his}} head that I am dying, has commenced a process against me, and will infallibly put my emaciated body into jail. Will you be so good as to accommodate me, and that by return of post, with ten pounds? O James, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> pride of my heart, you would feel doubly for me! Alas! I am not used to beg! The worst of it is, my health was coming about finely. Melancholy and low spirits are half my disease. If I had it settled, I would be, I think, quite well in a manner.|$|E

And I wonder not {{that it should be}} so, for there are times when I am weary of myself. Think you not it is a sore trial for flesh and blood, to be called upon to execute the righteous judgments of Heaven while we are yet in the body, and continue to retain that blinded sense and sympathy for carnal suffering, which makes our own flesh thrill when we strike a gash upon the body of another? And think you, that when some prime tyrant has been removed from his place, that the instruments of his punishment can at all times look back on their share in his downfall with firm and unshaken nerves? Must they not sometimes even question the truth of that inspiration which they have felt and acted under? Must they not sometimes doubt the origin of that strong impulse with which their prayers for heavenly direction under difficulties have been inwardly answered and confirmed, and confuse, in their disturbed apprehensions, the responses of Truth itself with some strong delusion of the enemy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I have said, {{the truly}} wise and learned disdain these shifts, and {{will open the}} said novel as avowedly as they would the lid of their snuff-box. I will only quote one instance, though I know a hundred. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> celebrated Watt of Birmingham, Captain Clutterbuck? I believe not, though, from what I am about to state, {{he would not have}} failed to have sought an {{acquaintance}} with you. It was only once my fortune to meet him, whether in body or in spirit it matters not. There were assembled about half a score of our Northern Lights, who had amongst them, Heaven knows how, a well-known character of your country, Jedediah Cleishbotham. This worthy person, having come to Edinburgh during the Christmas vacation, had become a sort of lion in the place, and was lead in leash from house to house along with the guisards, the stone-eater, and other amusements of the season, which [...] "exhibited their unparalleled feats to private family-parties, if required." [...] Amidst this company stood Mr. Watt, the man whose genius discovered the means of multiplying our national resources to a degree perhaps even beyond his own stupendous powers of calculation and combination; bringing the treasures of the abyss to the summit of the earth--giving the feeble arm of man the momentum of an Afrite--commanding manufactures to arise, as the rod of the prophet produced water in the desert--affording the means of dispensing with that time and tide which wait for no man, and of sailing without that wind which defied the commands and threats of Xerxes himself.|$|E
