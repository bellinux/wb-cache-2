40|$|Although the {{advancement}} of molecular oncology in gastric cancer lags behind that of colorectal cancer, the rapid developments witnessed {{in recent years have}} improved our understanding of the carcinogenesis, aetiology, progression and metastasis of gastric cancer. The <b>different</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> in intestinal and diffuse types of gastric cancer have further supported the concept that these two pathological types are different disease entities. The association of telomerase and cadherin changes with Helicobacter pylori infection reinforces its aetiological role. The mutated cadherin gene identified in familial gastric cancer has shone light onto the pathogenesis. Adhesion molecules have already been applied to daily clinical practice as prognostic markers. Future molecular studies will contribute to the screening, classification, disease monitoring and therapeutics of gastric cancer. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Background and objective: Endometrial cancer (EC) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} diagnosed gynecologic malignancy among women worldwide and may be classified {{on the basis of}} <b>different</b> <b>molecular,</b> pathologic and <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations,</b> including microsatellite instability (MSI). Although MSI is associated with a more favorable outcome in colorectal cancer, its relationship with prognosis in EC cancer is not yet clear. The aim of our study is to identify whether MSI correlates with survival of patients in EC. Materials and methods: We examined MSI status and survival of 109 women. MSI was detected by employing the Promega MSI Analysis System, which used 5 mononucleotides markers (BAT- 25, BAT- 26, NR- 21, NR- 24, and MONO- 27) to identify MSI in a tumor and normal tissue DNA and 2 pentanucleotide markers (Penta C and Penta D) for specimen identification. Median follow-up of patients was 40. 4 months (range 5. 2 – 47. 9). Survival was estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method and Cox regression analysis was used to assess the effects of different variables on patient survival. Results: MSI-high was detected in 15. 6 % EC cases, all of which were associated with endometrioid type histology. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis showed no statistically significant differences between patients with MSI-high and MSI stable tumors (P =  0. 4) and multivariate analysis concluded that MSI status remained insignificant after stage, histology and tumor grade adjustment (P =  0. 5). Conclusions: Our study showed no statistically significant relationship between MSI-high and survival of endometrial cancer patients...|$|R

40|$|Perivascular {{epithelioid}} cell tumors of {{gastrointestinal tract}} (GI PEComas) are exceedingly rare, {{with only a}} limited number of published reports worldwide. Given the scarcity of GI PEComas and their relatively short follow-up periods, our current knowledge of their biologic behavior, <b>molecular</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations,</b> diagnostic criteria, and prognostic factors continues to be very limited. We present 2 cases of GI PEComas, one of which showed an aggressive histologic behavior that underwent multiple combined chemotherapies. We also review the available English-language medical literature on GI PEComas-not otherwise specified (PEComas-NOS) and discuss their clinicopathological and <b>molecular</b> <b>genetic</b> features. Pathologic analyses including histomorphologic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural studies were performed to evaluate the clinicopathological features of GI PEComas, their diagnosis, and differential diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry, semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and DNA sequencing assays were carried out to detect the potential <b>molecular</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> in our cases. Microscopically, the tumors showed distinctive histologic features of PEComas-NOS, including fascicular or nested architecture, epithelioid or spindled cell type, and clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm. The tumor cells were immunohistochemically positive for melanocytic markers. Molecular pathological assays confirmed a PSF-TFE 3 gene fusion in one of our cases. Furthermore, in this case microphthalmia-associated transcription factor and its downstream genes were found to exhibit elevated transcript levels.

40|$|The {{relationship}} of abnormal nuclear morphology to <b>molecular</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> {{that are important}} in colorectal tumorigenesis is unknown. Therefore, Feulgen-stained isolated nuclei from 22 adenomas and 42 carcinomas that had been analyzed for ras gene mutations and allelic deletions on chromosomes 5 q, 18 q, and 17 p were characterized by computerized image analysis. Both nuclear area and the nuclear shape factor representing irregularity correlated with adenoma-carcinoma progression (r = 0. 57 and r = 0. 52, P < 0. 0001), whereas standard nuclear texture, a parameter of chromatin homogeneity, was inversely correlated with progression (r = - 0. 80, P < 0. 0001). The nuclear parameters were strongly interrelated (P < 0. 0005). In multivariate analysis, the nuclear parameters were predominantly associated with adenoma-carcinoma progression (P < or = 0. 0001) and were not influenced significantly by the individual <b>molecular</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations.</b> Nuclear texture, however, was inversely correlated with fractional allelic loss, a global measure of genetic changes, in carcinomas (r = - 0. 39, P = 0. 011). The findings indicate that nuclear morphology in colorectal neoplasms is strongly related to tumor progression.

It is hoped that through the study of the subtle <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> in bladder cancer, important prognostic and therapeutic targets can be exploited. Many new diagnostic tests and gene therapy approaches rely on the identification and targeting of these unique <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations.</b> A review of literature published on the molecular genetics of bladder cancer from 1970 to the present was conducted. A variety of <b>molecular</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> have been identified in bladder cancer. Oncogenes (H-ras, erbB- 2, EGFR, MDM 2, C-MYC, CCND 1), tumor suppressor genes (p 53, Rb, p 21, p 27 /KIP 1, p 16, PTEN, STK 15, FHIT, FEZI/LZTS 1, bc 10), telomerase, and methylation have all been studied in bladder cancer. Several have proven to be potentially useful clinical targets in the prognosis and therapy of bladder cancer such as staining for p 53 and gene therapy strategies such as p 53 and fezl.

40|$|Chronic {{myeloproliferative}} diseases without the Philadelphia chromosome marker (Ph-), although first described 60 years ago, only became {{the subject of}} interest {{after the turn of the}} millennium. In 2001, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined the classification of this group of diseases and in 2008 they were renamed myeloproliferative neoplasms based on morphological, cytogenetic and molecular features. In 2005, the identification of a recurrent molecular abnormality characterized by a gain of function with a mutation in the gene encoding Janus kinase 2 (JAK 2) paved the way for greater knowledge of the pathophysiology of myeloproliferative neoplasms. The JAK 2 mutation is found in 90 - 98 % of polycythemia vera and in about 50 % essential thrombocytosis and primary myelofibrosis. In addition to the JAK 2 mutation, other mutations involving TET 2 (ten-eleven translocation), LNK (a membrane-bound adaptor protein); IDH 1 / 2 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 / 2 enzyme); ASXL 1 (additional sex combs-like 1) genes were found in myeloproliferative neoplasms thus showing the importance of identifying <b>molecular</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> to confirm diagnosis, guide treatment and improve our understanding of the biology of these diseases. Currently, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytosis, myelofibrosis, chronic neutrophilic leukemia, chronic eosinophilic leukemia and mastocytosis are included in this group of myeloproliferative neoplasms, but are considered different situations with individualized diagnostic methods and treatment.

40|$|Abstract: Ovarian {{carcinoma}} (OC) is {{the most}} lethal gynecological malignancy. Response to platinum-based chemotherapy is poor in some patients and, thus, current research is focusing on new therapy options.

Purpose: We want to give an overview on the <b>molecular</b> <b>genetic</b> changes of the histopathological types of OC and their role as putative therapeutic targets. In Depth Review of Existing Data: In 2012, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor, bevacizumab, was approved for OC treatment. Bevacizumab has shown promising results as single agent and in combination with conventional chemotherapy, but its target is not distinctive when analyzed before treatment.

Giant cell (gc) GBMs are a rare variant of GBM characterized by a marked preponderance of multinucleated giant cells. Several reports have associated this entity with a more favorable prognosis than the majority of GBMs. To evaluate whether gcGBM may also represent a genetically defined subgroup of GBM, we analyzed a series of 19 gcGBMs for mutations in the TP 53 gene for amplification of the EGFR and CDK 4 genes and for homozygous deletions in the CDKN 2 A (p 16 /MTS 1) gene. Seventeen of nineteen gcGBMs carried TP 53 mutations whereas EGFR and CDK 4 gene amplification was seen in only one tumor each and homozygous deletion of CDKN 2 A was not observed at all. The strikingly high incidence of TP 53 mutations and the relative absence of other <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> groups gcGBM together with a previously recognized <b>molecular</b> <b>genetic</b> variant of GBM (type 1 GBM).

A total of 10, 216 determinations were made with 88 microsatellite markers, revealing 245 chromosomal loss events. The mechanisms of loss were remarkably chromosome-specific. Some chromosomes displayed complete loss such as that predicted to result from mitotic nondisjunction. However, {{more than half of the}} losses were associated with losses of only part of a chromosome rather than a whole chromosome. Surprisingly, these losses were due largely to structural alterations rather than to mitotic recombination, break-induced replication, or gene conversion, suggesting novel mechanisms for the generation of much of the aneuploidy in this common tumor type...|$|R

Over the past 20 years the cytogenetic and <b>molecular</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> associated with glioma formation and progression have been intensely studied and genetic profiles as additional aids to the definition of brain tumors have been incorporated in the WHO classification. In fact, first steps have been undertaken in supplementing classical histopathological diagnosis by the use of molecular tests, such as MGMT promoter hypermethylation in glioblastomas or detection of losses of chromosome arms 1 p and 19 q in oligodendroglial tumors. The tremendous progress that has been made in the use of array-based profiling techniques will likely contribute to a further molecular refinement of glioma classification and lead to the identification of glioma core pathways that can be specifically targeted by more individualized glioma therapies...|$|R

In order to search for evidence of clonal progression, we analyzed 10 EAOCs (endometrioid= 4; clear cell= 6) with coexisting endometriosis for common <b>molecular</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> in both the carcinoma and corresponding endometriosis. We used 82 microsatellite markers spanning the genome to examine loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the coexisting carcinoma and endometriosis samples. A total of 63 LOH events were detected in the carcinoma samples; twenty two of these were also detected in the corresponding endometriosis samples. In each case, the same allele was lost in the endometriosis and cancer samples. Interestingly, no marker showed LOH in the endometriosis alone.

40|$|The <b>molecular</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> of oligodendroglial tumors {{and mixed}} gliomas {{of the central}} nervous system were studied in a series of 37 cases (8 oligodendrogliomas, 13 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, 8 oligoastrocytomas, and 8 anaplastic oligoastrocytomas). A total of 180 {{polymorphic}} loci and 5 nonpolymorphic gene loci, distributed over all chromosomes, were examined by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Loss of heterozygosity was most frequently observed for loci on 19 q with a commonly deleted region at 19 q 13. 2 -q 13. 4 distal to the CYP 2 a gene and proximal to the D 19 S 22 locus. The incidence of allelic loss on 19 q was particularly high (81 %) in oligodendroglial tumors and equal to 31 % in mixed gliomas. More than 75 % of the tumors with allelic deletions on 19 q also showed loss of heterozygosity for loci on 1 p with one tumor showing only loss of alleles distal to the NGFB gene (1 p 13 -pter). Seven (19 %) tumors had lost alleles from 17 p with the deleted region including the TP 53 tumor suppressor gene in all cases. Sequencing of the TP 53 transcripts from exons 2 to 10, however, did not reveal mutations of the remaining allele in any of these tumors. Anaplastic oligodendrogliomas and anaplastic oligoastrocytomas demonstrated an increased incidence of additional allelic losses involving most frequently chromosomes 9 p and 10. Gene amplification was detected in two anaplastic tumors, affecting the epidermal growth factor receptor gene in both cases, with additional amplification of the renin gene at 1 q 32 in one of these cases. In total our results indicate both differences and similarities between the <b>molecular</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> in tumors with oligodendroglial and astrocytic differentiation. The loss of genetic information from 19 q and 1 p as well as the rarity of TP 53 mutations in oligodendroglial tumors suggests that the early events in their oncogenesis are distinct from those associated with astrocytic tumors. However, similarities are indicated by the allelic losses on 9 p and 10 in the anaplastic tumors, suggesting the utilization of common pathways of progression...|$|R

While considerable overlap in presentation sometimes exists, advances in identification of the precise etiology of specific overgrowth disorders continue to improve clinicians' ability to make an accurate diagnosis. Among them, this paper introduces two classic genetic overgrowth syndromes: Sotos syndrome and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Historically, the diagnosis was based entirely on clinical findings. However, it is now understood that Sotos syndrome is caused by a variety of <b>molecular</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> resulting in haploinsufficiency of the NSD 1 gene at chromosome 5 q 35 and that Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is caused by heterogeneous abnormalities in the imprinting of a number of growth regulatory genes within chromosome 11 p 15 in the majority of cases. Interestingly, the 11 p 15 imprinting region is also associated with Russell-Silver syndrome which is a typical growth retardation syndrome. Opposite epigenetic alterations in 11 p 15 result in opposite clinical features shown in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Russell-Silver syndrome. Although the exact functions of the causing genes have not yet been completely understood, these overgrowth syndromes can be good models to clarify the complex basis of human growth and help to develop better-directed therapies in the future...|$|R
40|$|Although the Vienna {{classification}} {{has been}} introduced to resolve discrepancies in histological diagnoses of colorectal tumors between Western and Japanese pathologists, practical applications of this classification scheme have been problematic because invasion of the lamina propria of tumor cells {{is often difficult to}} recognize. Therefore, the following refinements of the classification criteria are needed: category 3, low-grade adenoma/dysplasia; category 4, intramucosal borderline neoplasia; 4 -a, high-grade adenoma/dysplasia; 4 -b, well-differentiated adenocarcinoma; category 5, definite carcinoma; 5 -a, intramucosal moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma; and 5 -b, submucosal carcinoma. We attempted to test whether <b>molecular</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> are related to the modified classification scheme and whether they may help to further categorize the various intramucosal neoplasia grades of colorectal tumors. Two-hundred-thirty-two colorectal tumors were examined using flow cytometric analysis of DNA content, polymerase chain reaction microsatellite assays, and single-strand conformational polymorphism assays to detect abnormalities of DNA content, chromosomal allelic loss, and Ki-ras and p 53 gene mutations. Microsatellite instability (MSI) was also examined. Frequencies of <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> and DNA aneuploid states increased with an increase in the grade assigned according to the modified Vienna classification. MSI was a rare event in colorectal adenomas and their frequency of MSI did not correlate with tumor grade.

So far, only X-chromosome inactivation studies were performed to study this issue. We used a genome-wide allelotyping to assess clonality in 47 metachronous and/or synchronous multifocal tumors from 22 patients, using 59 microsatellite markers. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was observed in only 34 of 1969 informative markers in 9 of 22 serous borderline cases studied. Of these cases, 7 showed concordant LOH for at least one polymorphic marker in more than one tumor site. Flanking microsatellite markers enabled identification of identical chromosomal breakpoints in 6 of 7 cases. The LOH results strongly favor a common origin indicated by a likelihood ratio (possibility common origin/possibility independent origin) ranging from 39 to 14, 163.

We evaluated 9 angiomyolipoma for which frozen tissue was available from a consecutive surgical series. Seven of 8 samples subjected to RT-PCR-cDNA sequencing showed mutations in TSC 2; none showed mutations in TSC 1 or RHEB. Six of the seven mutations were deletions. We searched for 983 activating and inactivating mutations in 115 genes, and found none in these tumors. Similarly analysis for genomic regions of loss or gain, assessed by Affymetrix SNP 6. 0 analysis, showed no abnormalities. Loss of heterozygosity in the TSC 2 region was commonly seen, except in patients with low frequency TSC 2 mutations. We conclude that sporadic renal angiomyolipoma usually have mutations in TSC 2, but not TSC 1 or RHEB, and have no other common genomic events, among those we searched for.

Molecular classification based on the <b>genetic</b> <b>alteration</b> divides sarcomas into two main categories: (i) sarcomas with specific genetic alterations; which can further be subclassified based on a) reciprocal translocations resulting in oncogenic fusion transcripts (e. g. EWSR 1 -FLI 1 in Ewing sarcoma) and b) specific oncogenic mutations (e. g. KIT and PDGFRA mutations in gastrointestinal stromal tumors) and (ii) sarcomas displaying multiple, complex karyotypic abnormalities with no specific pattern, including leiomyo-sarcoma, and pleomorphic liposarcoma. These specific <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> are an important adjunct to standard morphological and immunohistochemical diagnoses, {{and in some cases}} have a prognostic value, e. g., Ewing family tumors, synovial sarcoma, and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. In addition, these studies may also serve as markers to detect minimal residual disease and can aid in staging or monitor the efficacy of therapy. Furthermore, sarcoma-specific fusion genes and other emerging molecular events may also represent potential targets for novel therapeutic approaches such as Gleevec for dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. Therefore, increased understanding of the molecular biology of sarcomas is leading towards development of newer and more effective treatment regimens. The review focuses on recent advances in <b>molecular</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> having an impact on diagnostics, prognostication and clinical management of selected sarcomas...|$|R
40|$|Ovarian {{carcinoma}} (OC) is {{the most}} lethal gynecological malignancy. Response to platinum-based chemotherapy is poor in some patients and, thus, current research is focusing on new therapy options. The various histological types of OC are characterized by distinctive <b>molecular</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> that are relevant for ovarian tumorigenesis. The understanding of these molecular pathways {{is essential for the}} development of novel therapeutic strategies. Purpose: We want to give an overview on the <b>molecular</b> <b>genetic</b> changes of the histopathological types of OC and their role as putative therapeutic targets. In Depth Review of Existing Data: In 2012, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor, bevacizumab, was approved for OC treatment. Bevacizumab has shown promising results as single agent and in combination with conventional chemotherapy, but its target is not distinctive when analyzed before treatment. At present, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and components of the EGFR pathway are in the focus of clinical research. Interestingly, some phytochemical substances show good synergistic effects when used in combination with chemotherapy. Conclusion: Ongoing studies of targeted agents in conjunction with chemotherapy will show whether there are alternative options to bevacizumab available for OC patients. Novel targets which can be assessed before therapy to predict efficacy are needed. The assessment of therapeutic targets is continuously improved by molecular pathological analyses on tumor tissue. A careful selection of patients for personalized treatment will help to reduce putative side effects and toxicity...|$|R

It has truly become a field that is intensely linked to <b>molecular</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations,</b> especially DNA-repair defects. Germline breast cancer 1 gene (BRCA 1) and breast cancer 2 gene (BRCA 2) mutations are implicated in the highest risk of prostate cancer (PC) predisposition and aggressiveness. Poly adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase (PARP) proteins {{play a key role}} in DNA repair mechanisms and represent a valid target for new therapies. Olaparib is an oral PARP inhibitor that blocks DNA repair pathway and coupled with BRCA mutated-disease results in tumor cell death. In phase II clinical trials, including patients with advanced castration-resistant PC, olaparib seems to be efficacious and well tolerated. Waiting for randomized phase III trials, olaparib should be considered as a promising treatment option for PC.

40|$|Colorectal cancer (CRC) {{represents}} {{the third most}} diagnosed cancer type worldwide, accounting for more than 600. 000 deaths in 2012, which approximately represents 8, 5 % of all cancer-related deaths. It arises from the inner intestinal layer, usually from preexisting polyps that, {{after a series of}} <b>molecular</b> and <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations,</b> finally generate colorectal tumors. It is very important to consider that in CRC patients, the appearance of cancer metastasis, tumor masses that originate from primary tumors at distant sites, strongly determine patient prognosis. Only 8 - 10 % of patients diagnosed with CRC at advanced stages survive after five years of follow up, which reinforces the importance of metastasis research to improve patient management and survival rates in CRC...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} whether differences in survival for endometrial cancer attributed to race are primarily associated with socioeconomic status, comorbid illnesses, <b>molecular</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations,</b> and other disease-related characteristics identified as poor prognostic factors. One hundred fifty-two surgically staged patients with endometrial cancer (37 African-American and 115 European-American women) treated from 1990 to 1994 were analyzed {{for differences in}} demographics, disease-related characteristics, and survival. Survival was poorer for African-American women than for European-American women. African-American women had lower socioeconomic status and a higher prevalence of poor prognostic factors. Surgical stage, positive peritoneal cytology, angiolymphatic invasion, cervical stromal involvement, {{and a history of}} other malignancies were similar between the two groups. The most important predictors of survival were age at diagnosis, surgical stage, myometrial invasion, positive peritoneal cytology, cervical stromal involvement, tumor grade, aneuploidy, histology, S-phase fraction, number of poor prognostic factors, and race. Racial differences in survival were not explained by socioeconomic status, comorbid illnesses, or estrogen use. When incorporating the number of poor prognostic factors in a survival model with race and surgical stage, race ceased to be of significant prognostic value. In an analysis restricted to women with poor prognostic factors, this phenomena also occurred after adjusting for the number of poor prognostic factors. These findings suggest that the cumulative number of poor prognostic factors, not race, is a more important predictor of survival in endometrial cancer...|$|R
