The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the repair process taking place in the delayed replantation of monkey teeth using calcium hydroxide and MTA as root canal filling materials. Five monkeys had their lateral incisors extracted and bench-dried for 60 minutes. After root canal preparation, the teeth were assigned to two groups according to root canal filling material: I, calcium hydroxide; and II, MTA. The same treatment sequence was followed for both groups: coronal seal, periodontal ligament removal, immersion of the tooth in 2 % acidulated-phosphate sodium fluoride, irrigation of the socket with saline and replantation. Both groups exhibited replacement resorption, areas of ankylosis and absence of inflammatory root resorption. Statistically similar results (p > 0. 05) were observed for both groups regarding replacement root resorption, but the groups differed significantly (p < 0. 05) regarding the occurrence of ankylosis.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the prevalence, severity and pattern of caries in preschool children of Al-Ahsa, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Methods: Three {{hundred and twenty}} two randomly selected pre-school children were examined in kindergartens of Al-Hasa, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for dental caries using World Health Organization criteria for the diagnosis of caries. The study was completed in 2000. Results: The mean decayed missing and <b>filled</b> <b>teeth</b> score in the 322 pre-school children examined was 2. 92 (standard deviation 3. 51) with decay component as the major contributor in the decayed missing and <b>filled</b> <b>teeth</b> score. The difference between mean decayed missing and <b>filled</b> <b>teeth</b> scores was not significant in relation to gender, type of kindergarten (government or private) and area (urban or rural). The difference between mean decayed missing and <b>filled</b> <b>teeth</b> scores of 4 -year-old and 5 -year- old children was statistically significant. Of the 322 children examined, 202 (62. 7 %) were caries positive. There {{was no significant difference}} for caries prevalence in relation to gender, type of kindergarten and area. But, the difference in caries prevalence between various age groups was statistically significant. The mandibular first molars were the most carious teeth followed by mandibular 2 nd molars and maxillary central incisors. The least affected teeth were mandibular central incisors. Conclusion: The mean decayed missing and <b>filled</b> <b>teeth</b> score and caries prevalence in the studied pre-school children is high as compared with children from developed countries. A major decay component indicates a high percentage of untreated caries. A high percentage of carious maxillary incisors indicate a nursing caries pattern. King Saud Universit...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} aimed {{to examine the}} {{influence}} of the quality of root canal fillings and coronal restorations on the prevalence of periapical lesions. Materials and Methods: Two hundred digital panoramic radiographs were obtained from the archive of Al‑HamziDental Center in Sana’a, Yemen. The final sample consisted of 120 radiographs, and 675 root <b>filled</b> <b>teeth.</b> The quality of root canal fillings was scored according to criteria of length, homogeneity and taper. Coronal status (type of restoration, signs of marginal leakage or decay) was also evaluated. The periapical status was categorized on the basis of presence or absence of radiographical signs of apical periodontitis. Chi-square test was used to determine statistical significance between different parameters. Results: We found that 93. 6 % of root <b>filled</b> <b>teeth</b> were associated with apical periodontitis. Only 9. 2 % of root <b>filled</b> <b>teeth</b> were found to have an acceptable standard of root canal fillings, of which 32. 3 % was also associated to signs of periapical disease. In roots with an unacceptable root canal filling, 95. 4 % had periapical disease. Teeth with good (14. 4 %) and poor (32. 9 %) intra-coronal restorations had apical periodontitis in 93. 8 % and 97. 7 % of cases, respectively.

40|$|The Taiwanese {{government}} has implemented National Health Insurance (NHI) {{for nine years}} since March 1, 1995. The government began to have deficits since March of 1998 because medical expenditures exceeded income to the insurance program. Political problems have prevented increasing the funding for the NHI. In order to control medical expenditures, the government began to implement the Global Budgeting System (GBS) in July of 1998. The resultant decreases in funding to the NHI have hindered its work. Because the dentists practiced only outpatient care, and 92 % of their services are primary services, {{they were the first}} group that the government regulated. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate how GBS has affected dental service fees and the quality of dental care. The main dental procedures are scaling (primary care), <b>filling</b> <b>teeth</b> (secondary care), and root canal repair and extraction of teeth (tertiary care). This study evaluates these procedures according to their prices, number of procedures performed, materials chosen by dentists in different regions, and the dental care institutions, in order to determine if GBS has actually improved dental services. Most data for this study come from reimbursement data for dental services performed from 1996 to 2001. They include the cases, service fees, materials used in different procedures, dental care institutions, and regions of all contracted providers.

40|$|AIM: To {{study the}} 20 -year {{survival}} rate and periapical status of root <b>filled</b> <b>teeth</b> in a Swedish population requiring high-cost dental care {{and to identify}} factors related to survival and normal periapical status at follow-up. METHODOLOGY: The study population comprised 104 patients selected from four local health insurance districts with treatment plans including radiographs submitted for approval for reimbursement from the Swedish National Dental Insurance in 1977. In 1998, a clinical and radiographic follow-up examination was conducted, to register the status of 449 teeth identified as root filled at baseline. Differences in tooth survival and periapical status at follow-up, with reference to periapical status and quality of root filling at baseline, were analysed by chi-square tests. Multiple regression {{analysis was used to}} describe tooth survival and normal periapical status at follow-up, with the explanatory baseline variables: tooth type, type of restoration, type of post, quality of root filling, periapical status, marginal bone loss and caries. Differences were considered significant at a 5 % level. RESULTS: Two hundred and ninety (65 %) of the root <b>filled</b> <b>teeth</b> survived at follow-up. Baseline variables associated with low odds for tooth survival were mandibular molar, maxillary premolar, prefabricated posts other than screw posts, severe marginal bone loss, caries and apical periodontitis (AP). Normal periapical status at follow-up was registered in 49 % of the root <b>filled</b> <b>teeth.</b> Baseline variables associated with low odds for normal periapical status (high risk for AP) at follow-up were mandibular molar, maxillary premolar, AP, severe marginal bone loss and inadequate root filling quality. Of the root <b>filled</b> <b>teeth</b> with AP at baseline, 42 % had been left untreated during the observation period, and at follow-up, the AP persisted in 57 % of these teeth.

40|$|Background: Severe early {{childhood}} caries (S-ECC) and decay exfoliation <b>filling</b> <b>teeth</b> (def-t) > 6 is a destructive disease that afflicts teeth, including maxillary anterior teeth. In Indonesia, {{the prevalence of}} this disease is still high, for instance in Semarang 2007, the rate reached 90. 5 % in urban areas and 95. 9 % in rural areas for {{early childhood}} caries which is caused by Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans). Neutrophils are effector cells of innate immunity which become {{the main component of}} the very first line of defense against microbes. Purpose: This study analyzed the effect caused by the change of CD 63 expression on the surface of salivary neutrophils and the increased level of S. mutans in S-ECC. Method: This study employs observational analytic and cross sectional approach by using T test analysis technique for forty cases of early childhood that had been divided into two groups, first group of twenty children positively diagnosed as S-ECC and second group of twenty children negatively diagnosed as the control group. The sample’s result of gargling with 1. 5 % NaCl was used for neutrophils isolation and analysis function of salivary neutrophils phagocytosis by using flow cytometry test, while the sample of saliva was used to isolate S. mutans and calculate the level of S. mutans. Result: The expression of CD 63 + salivary neutrophils in S-ECC was lower (2. 32 % ± 0. 57) than in caries-free (2. 67 % ± 0. 46), while the level of S. mutans showed that the level was not higher than in S-ECC (9. 78 ± 2. 22) x 105 CFU/ml compared to in caries-free (5. 13 ± 1. 86) x 105 CFU/ml. Conclusion: The low expression of CD 63 in salivary neutrophils can lead to the increased level of S. mutans in S-ECC. </span...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Before {{strategies}} or protocols for {{oral health}} care can be advised at population level, epidemiological information on tooth decay patterns {{and its effects}} on oral function are indispensable. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate influences of socio-demographic variables on the prevalence of decayed, missing, filled (DMF) and sound teeth (S t) and to determine the relative risk of teeth in different dental regions for D, M, and F, of adults living in urban and rural areas in Southern Vietnam. Methods Cross-sectional DMF and S t data of 2965 dentate subjects aged 20 to 95 living in urban and rural areas in three provinces were collected by means of a self-administered questionnaire and an oral examination. The sample was stratified by age, gender, residence and province. Results The percentage of subjects having missing teeth was high for all ages while it was low for subjects with decayed and <b>filled</b> <b>teeth.</b> The mean number of missing teeth increased gradually by age from approximately 1 in each jaw at the age of 20 to 8 at the age of 80. The number of decayed teeth was relative low at all ages, being highest in molars at young ages. The mean number of <b>filled</b> <b>teeth</b> was extremely low at all ages in all dental regions. Every additional year of age gives a significantly lower chance for decay, a higher chance for missing, and a lower chance for <b>filled</b> <b>teeth.</b> Molars had a significantly higher risk for decay, missing and filled than premolars and anterior teeth. Females had significantly higher risk for decayed and <b>filled</b> <b>teeth,</b> and less chance for missing teeth than males. Urban subjects presented lower risk for decay, but approximately 4 times greater chance for having fillings than rural subjects. Low socio-economic status (SES) significantly increased the chance for missing anterior and molar teeth; subjects with high SES had more often fillings. Conclusions The majority of adults of Southern Vietnam presented a reduced dentition. The combination of low numbers of <b>filled</b> <b>teeth</b> and relative high numbers of decayed and missing teeth indicates that the main treatment for decay is extraction. Molars are more at risk for being decayed or missing than premolars and anterior teeth. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Dental assistants {{help the}} dentist in {{preparing}} material for <b>filling</b> <b>teeth.</b> Amalgam was the filling material mostly {{commonly used in}} Norway before 1980, and declined to about 5 % of all fillings in 2005. Amalgam is usually an alloy of silver, copper, tin and mercury. Copper amalgam, giving particularly high exposure to mercury was used in Norway until 1994. Metallic mercury is neurotoxic. Few studies of the health of dental assistants exist, despite their exposure to mercury. There are questions {{about the existence of}} possible chronic neurological symptoms today within this working group, due to this exposure. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the occurrence of neurological symptoms among dental assistants likely to be exposed to mercury from work with dental filling material, compared to similar health personnel with no such exposure. Methods All dental assistants still at work and born before 1970 registered in the archives of a trade union in Hordaland county of Norway were invited to participate (response rate 68 %, n = 41), as well as a similar number of randomly selected assistant nurses (response rate 87 %, n = 64) in the same age group. The participants completed a self-administered, mailed questionnaire, with questions about demographic variables, life-style factors, musculoskeletal, neurological and psychosomatic symptoms (Euroquest). Results The dental assistants reported significant higher occurrence of neurological symptoms; psychosomatic symptoms, problems with memory, concentration, fatigue and sleep disturbance, but not for mood. This was found by analyses of variance, adjusting for age, education, alcohol consumption, smoking and personality traits. For each specific neurological symptom, adjusted logistic regression analyses were performed, showing that these symptoms were mainly from arms, hands, legs and balance organs. Conclusion There is a possibility that the higher occurrence of neurological symptoms among the dental assistants may be related to their previous work exposure to mercury amalgam fillings. This should be studied further to assess the clinical importance of the reported symptoms. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background Dental assistants {{help the}} dentist in {{preparing}} material for <b>filling</b> <b>teeth.</b> Amalgam was the filling material mostly {{commonly used in}} Norway before 1980, and declined to about 5 % of all fillings in 2005. Amalgam is usually an alloy of silver, copper, tin and mercury. Copper amalgam, giving particularly high exposure to mercury was used in Norway until 1994. Metallic mercury is neurotoxic. Few studies of the health of dental assistants exist, despite their exposure to mercury. There are questions {{about the existence of}} possible chronic neurological symptoms today within this working group, due to this exposure. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the occurrence of neurological symptoms among dental assistants likely to be exposed to mercury from work with dental filling material, compared to similar health personnel with no such exposure. Methods All dental assistants still at work and born before 1970 registered in the archives of a trade union in Hordaland county of Norway were invited to participate (response rate 68 %, n = 41), as well as a similar number of randomly selected assistant nurses (response rate 87 %, n = 64) in the same age group. The participants completed a self-administered, mailed questionnaire, with questions about demographic variables, life-style factors, musculoskeletal, neurological and psychosomatic symptoms (Euroquest). Results The dental assistants reported significant higher occurrence of neurological symptoms; psychosomatic symptoms, problems with memory, concentration, fatigue and sleep disturbance, but not for mood. This was found by analyses of variance, adjusting for age, education, alcohol consumption, smoking and personality traits. For each specific neurological symptom, adjusted logistic regression analyses were performed, showing that these symptoms were mainly from arms, hands, legs and balance organs. Conclusion There is a possibility that the higher occurrence of neurological symptoms among the dental assistants may be related to their previous work exposure to mercury amalgam fillings. This should be studied further to assess the clinical importance of the reported symptoms...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aim. It is {{considered}} that over 450 million people worldwide suffer from {{some form of}} mental disorder. Previous studies in other countries have shown that schizophrenia {{is among the most}} frequent. Oral health is significant for general health and should not be separated from mental health. Studies in other countries have shown an increased incidence of carious and extracted teeth, and less incidence of <b>filled</b> <b>teeth</b> in this group of psychiatric patients. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish condition of the existing teeth, to determine the prevalence of caries and to consider possible risk factors that contribute to the current oral health status of hospitalized patients with schizophrenia. Methods. The study comprised 190 patients with schizophrenia, hospitalized at the Clinic for Psychiatric Disorders “Dr. Laza Lazarević” in Belgrade, and 190 mentally healthy patients at the Clinic for Periodontology and Oral Medicine, Faculty of Dental Medicine in Belgrade. The decayed, missing, filled (DMF) index, sociodemographic and economic characteristics were registered in both groups, as well as characteristics of the primary disease of hospitalized patients with schizophrenia. Results. The value of DMF index (representing the sum of carious, extracted and <b>filled</b> <b>teeth),</b> in the hospitalized patients with schizophrenia was 18. 57 ± 7. 07 and 12. 47 ± 5. 64 in the healthy group (p = 0. 000). The structure of the DMF index in the study group showed that caries and extracted teeth dominated with 88. 1 %; in the control group, <b>filled</b> <b>teeth</b> dominated with 55. 6 %, which was a statistically significant difference for all the three observed variables. Conclusion. Hospitalized patients with schizophrenia had twice as many caries and extracted teeth, and five time less <b>filled</b> <b>teeth</b> than healthy people. The patient’s age and taking antiparkinsonics were established as predictors of the increased DMF index in hospitalized patients with schizophrenia...|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2004 Public Health Association of AustraliaOBJECTIVE: Health Card holders are a financially {{disadvantaged}} group {{and are the}} target population eligible for public-funded dental care. The aims {{of this study were}} to describe the oral health status of public-funded dental patients by age, sex, type of care and geographic location, and to compare trends over time. METHODS: Patients were sampled randomly by State/Territory dental services in 1995 / 96 and 2001 / 02. Dentists recorded oral health status at the initial visit of a course of care using written instructions. The samples were weighted in proportion to the numbers of public-funded dental patients for each State/Territory. RESULTS: Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that caries experience measured by the DMFT index increased across older age groups (p< 0. 05). For male compared with female patients mean numbers of decayed teeth were higher (beta= 0. 74), and <b>filled</b> <b>teeth</b> lower (beta=- 1. 16). For emergency compared with general care, mean numbers of decayed and missing teeth were higher (beta= 0. 52 and beta= 0. 76), and <b>filled</b> <b>teeth</b> lower (beta=- 1. 08). For major city compared with regional/remote patients, mean numbers of decayed (beta=- 0. 35) and missing teeth were lower (beta=- 0. 34). Between 1995 / 96 and 2001 / 02 numbers of decayed teeth were higher (beta= 0. 81) while numbers of <b>filled</b> <b>teeth</b> were lower (beta=- 0. 55). CONCLUSIONS: There was variation in oral health among public dental patients by sex, type of care and location, and there was a trend towards lower numbers of <b>filled</b> <b>teeth</b> but higher numbers of decayed teeth and higher overall caries experience over time. IMPLICATIONS: Despite population trends towards improved oral health, levels of untreated decayed teeth have increased among public dental patients. D. S. Brennan and A. J. Spence...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to confirm whether the level of {{lifetime}} fluoridation exposure is associated with lower dental caries experience in younger adults (15 - 46 years). METHODS: Data of the cohort born between 1960 and 1990 residing outside Australia's capital cities from the 2004 - 2006 Australian National Survey of Adult Oral Health were analysed. Residential history questionnaires were used to determine the percentage of each person's lifetime exposure to fluoridated water (< 50 %/ 50 +%). Examiners recorded decayed, missing and <b>filled</b> permanent <b>teeth</b> (DMFT). Socio-demographic variables, periodontal risk factors, and access to dental care were included in multivariable least-squares regression models. RESULTS: In bivariate analysis, the higher level of fluoridation category had significantly lower DMFT (mean 6. 01 [SE= 0. 62]) than the lower level of fluoridation group (9. 14 [SE= 0. 73] p< 0. 01) and lower numbers of <b>filled</b> <b>teeth</b> (4. 08 [SE= 0. 43], 7. 06 [SE= 0. 62], p< 0. 01). In multivariate analysis, the higher number of full-time equivalent dentists per 100, 000 people was associated with a lower mean number of missing teeth (regression coefficient estimate=- 1. 75, p= 0. 03), and the higher level of water fluoridation with a lower mean DMFT (- 2. 45, p< 0. 01) and mean number of <b>filled</b> <b>teeth</b> (- 2. 52, p< 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: The higher level of lifetime fluoridation exposure was associated with substantially lower caries experience in younger rural adults, largely due to a lower number of <b>filled</b> <b>teeth.</b> LA Crocombe, DS Brennan, GD Slade, JF Stewart, and AJ Spence...|$|R
40|$|Background. In {{previous}} studies, {{the oral}} and dental health statuses were compared in hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients without {{taking into account}} the effect of educational levels on oral health. Hence we aimed to make a comparison of these parameters based upon the subjects educational levels. Patients and Methods. 76 PD (33 males, 43 females-mean age: 44 &#x 00 B 1; 12 years) and 100 HD (56 males, 44 females-mean age: 46 &#x 00 B 1; 14 years) patients were included. The number of decayed, missing and <b>filled</b> <b>teeth</b> were detected, DMFT index was calculated and plaque index (PI) values were assessed. Results. Significantly higher numbers of <b>filled</b> <b>teeth</b> (P&#x 003 C;. 001) and lower PI values (P&#x 003 C;. 01) in the PD group were detected with higher educational levels, whereas no significance was detected in the HD group. Higher DMFT index values were assessed in the lower educated and high school levels in PD than HD patients (P&#x 003 C;. 05). Higher numbers of <b>filled</b> <b>teeth</b> (P&#x 003 C;. 05) were detected in the secondary school level in PD patients. This difference was even more significant in the high school level (P&#x 003 C;. 001). Conclusion. We assume that PD patients, who were found to be in a higher educational level, are more caring for their oral health as compared to HD patients...|$|R

40|$|Objectives This study charted the {{trajectories of}} dental caries, {{including}} decayed teeth, missing <b>teeth</b> and <b>filled</b> <b>teeth</b> among older A mericans over a 5 ‐year period. In particular, it focused on racial {{differences in the}} levels of and rates of change in dental caries experience. Methods Data came from the Piedmont Dental Study. The sample included 810 older Americans who were dentate at the baseline with up to 4 repeated observations between 1988 and 1994. Hierarchical linear models were employed in depicting intrapersonal and interpersonal differences in dental caries experience. Results Different measures of caries outcomes exhibited distinct trajectories. On average, the number of decayed teeth decreased over time, whereas missing teeth increased. In contrast, the number of <b>filled</b> <b>teeth</b> remained stable during a 5 ‐year period. Relative to their white counterparts, older black A mericans had more decayed teeth and missing <b>teeth</b> but fewer <b>filled</b> <b>teeth.</b> Blacks and whites differed in the levels of dental caries but not in their rates of change except for missing teeth. Even when demographic and socioeconomic attributes were adjusted, racial variations in dental caries experience remained significant. Conclusions Although significantly correlated, various dental caries outcomes move along different paths over time. In view of the persistent racial disparities in dental caries trajectories, future interventions to minimize such variations among older A mericans in the levels of and the rates of change in dental caries experience are clearly warranted...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the dental status of 88 cancer patients before chemotherapy. Material and methods: Eighty-eight patients with cancer in different body locations were studied and {{compared with a}} control group. Dental plaque was assessed {{by means of the}} Silness and Löe index, dental status with the DMFT index, and periodontal status with the modified CPI index. Results: In the oncological patients the mean Silness and Löe index was 1. 28 ± 0. 11. Patients showed multiple missing teeth (mean number 7. 55 ± 0. 80); the mean number of decayed teeth was 2. 10 ± 0. 36; and the mean number of <b>filled</b> <b>teeth</b> was 2. 27 ± 0. 37. As to periodontal status, the mean modified CPI index was 1. 45 ± 0. 11. In the control group, the mean Silness and Löe index was 0. 94 ± 0. 00. The mean number of decayed teeth was 1. 21 ± 0. 25; the mean number of missing teeth was 4. 97 ± 0. 67; and the mean number of <b>filled</b> <b>teeth</b> was 4. 82 ± 0. 44. The mean modified CPI index was 1. 29 ± 0. 10. Conclusions: Oncological patients in our study showed more dental plaque versus healthy patients and more decayed and missing teeth. However, patients in the control group showed more <b>filled</b> <b>teeth</b> than cancer patients. Periodontal status as determined by the modified CPI index was similar in both patient groups...|$|R
40|$|Background: Micro-organisms are {{the primary}} causative agents of endodontic infections. Phenotype based {{procedures}} for bacterial identification has certain drawbacks especially, when investigating the microbiota of root-filled teeth. Thus, more sensitive methods like Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can provide results that are more accurate and reliable for the microbial prevalence in the root <b>filled</b> <b>teeth.</b> Aim: In this study, we have investigated twenty symptomatic root-filled teeth with chronic apical periodontitis for the prevalence of Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans in the root <b>filled</b> <b>teeth</b> associated with symptomatic cases with or without periradicular lesions. Materials and Methods: Microbiological samples {{were taken from the}} canals immediately after removal of previous gutta percha cones using aseptic techniques. After removal of root canal filling, samples were obtained with paper points placed in the canal. Paper points were transferred to a cryotube containing "Tris EDTA" buffer and immediately frozen at − 20 °C. Results: By PCR amplification of the samples using taxon specific primers, E. faecalis was found to be prevalent species, detected in 65 % of the cases and C. albicans was detected in 35 % of cases. Conclusion: The results of the study shows that geographical influence and dietary factors might have some role to play in the prevalence of the species like C. albicans and presence of E. faecalis confirming the assertion of previous culture-dependent and independent approaches for the microbiological survey of root <b>filled</b> <b>teeth...</b>|$|R
