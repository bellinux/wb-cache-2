Morphology of the nanocomposites has been examined by electronic microscopy. The relationship between the preparation method, morphology, and electrical conductivity was studied. Electronic microscopy images reveal that the nanocomposites exhibit well dispersed graphene platelets. The incorporation of EG to the PET results in a sharp insulator-to-conductor transition with a percolation threshold (Ï† c) as low as 0. 05 wt %. An electrical conductivity of 10 - 3 S/cm was achieved for 0. 4 wt % of EG. The low percolation threshold and relatively high electrical conductivity are attributed to the high aspect ratio, large surface area, and uniform dispersion of the EG sheets in PET matrix. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Separately the prediction of the structure of protein complexes by docking methods is a well-established scientific area. To date, docking programs have not been used to predict interaction partners. We provide a proof of principle for such an approach. Using a set of protein complexes representing known interactors in their unbound form, we show that a standard docking program can distinguish the true interactors from a background of 922 non-redundant potential interactors. We additionally show that true interactions can be distinguished from non-likely interacting proteins within the same structural family. Our approach may be put {{in the context of the}} proposed funnel-energy model; the docking algorithm may not find the native complex, but it distinguishes binding partners because of the higher probability of favourable models compared with a collection of non-binders.

40|$|We {{develop a}} general {{framework}} for modelling mixing in porous media flows, {{in which the}} scalar mixture is represented as an ensemble of lamellae evolving through stretching, diffusion and coalescence. Detailed numerical simulations in Darcy scale heterogeneous permeability fields are used to analyse the lamella deformation process, which controls the local concentration gradients and thus {{the evolution of the}} concentration mixture through stretching enhanced diffusion. The corresponding Lagrangian deformation process is shown to be well modelled by a Langevin equation with multiplicative noise, which can be coupled with diffusion to predict the temporal evolution of the concentration probability density function (PDF). At late times, lamella interaction is enforced by confinement of the mixture within the dispersion area. This process is shown to be well represented by a random aggregation model, which quantifies the frequency of lamella coalescence and allows us to predict the temporal evolution of the concentration PDF in this regime. The proposed theoretical framework provides an accurate prediction of the concentration PDFs at all investigated times, heterogeneity levels and Péclet numbers. In particular, it relates the temporal behaviour of mixing, as quantified by concentration moments, scalar dissipation rate or spatial increments of concentration, to the degree of structural heterogeneity. © Cambridge University Press 2015.

Examples {{will be used to}} highlight the, sometimes complex, interactions between organism/population properties (i. e, height, area, volume, flexibility, density and distribution) and near-bed hydrodynamics. Innovative approaches for examining transfer rates under natural hydrodynamic conditions will demonstrate how these interactions can determine the transfer (and retention) of nutrients and particles between the water column and benthos, creating intra-specific micro-niches (or zones) with different physiochemical properties (potentially influencing biodiversity). Finally, inter-specific differences in bio-hydrodynamic effects will be discussed in relation to benthic processes (such as the burial of organic matter, i. e, the “blue carbon hypothesis”) and suggestions will be made about the potential consequences of changes in benthic habitat distribution for the functioning of shallow, benthic ecosystems.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that human activities, such as harvesting, have had major direct effects on marine ecosystems. However, it is far less {{acknowledged}} that human activities in the surroundings might have important effects on marine systems. There is growing evidence suggesting that major reorganization (i. e., a regime shift) is a common feature in the temporal evolution of a marine system. Here we show, and quantify, the interaction of human activities (nutrient upload) with a favourable climate (run-off) and its contribution to the eutrophication of the Black Sea in the 1980 s. Based on virtual analysis of the bottom-up (eutrophication) vs. top-down (trophic cascades) effects, we found that an earlier onset of eutrophication could have counteracted the restructuring of the trophic regulation {{at the base of the}} food web that resulted from the depletion of top predators in the 1970 s. These enhanced bottom-up effects would, however, not propagate upwards in the food web beyond the zooplankton level. Our simulations identified the removal of apex predators as a key element in terms of loss of resilience that inevitably leads to a reorganization. Once the food web has been truncated, the type and magnitude of interventions on the group replacing the apex predator as the new upper trophic level have no effect in preventing the trophic cascade. By characterizing the tipping point at which increased bottom-up forcing exactly counteracts the top-down cascading effects, our results emphasize the importance of a comprehensive analysis that take into account all structuring forces at play (including those beyond the marine system) at a given time.

Our study revealed that in-streamattenuation was highly variable among pharmaceuticals and river segments and {{that none of the}} considered pharmaceutical physicochemical and molecular properties proved to be relevant in determining the mean attenuation rates. Instead, the octanol–water partition coefficient (Kow) influenced the variability of rates among river segments, likely due to its effect on sorption to sediments and suspended particles, and therefore influencing the balance between the different attenuation mechanisms (biotransformation, photolysis, sorption, and volatilization).

Water losses and gains were measured using eight high-precision minilysimeters, placed around an olive tree, which had been irrigated until the soil reached field capacity (∼ 0. 22 m 3 m- 3). They were subsequently left to dry for 10 days. A pair of lysimeters was situated {{at each of the}} main points of the compass (N, E, S, W), at a distance of 1 m. (the inner set of lysimeters; ILS) and 2 m (the outer set of lysimeters; OLS), respectively, from the tree trunk. Distinct periods o f moisture loss (evaporation) and moisture gain (vapor adsorption) could be distinguished for each day. Vapor adsorption often started just after noon and generally lasted until the (early) evening. Values of up to 0. 7 mm of adsorbed water per day were measured. Adsorption was generally largest for the OLS (up to 100 % more on a daily basis), and increased during the dry down. This was mainly the result of lower OLS surface soil moisture contents (period-average absolute difference ∼ 0. 005 m 3 m- 3), as illustrated using various analyses employing a set of micrometeorological equations describing the exchange of water vapor between bare soil and the atmosphere. These analyses also showed that the amount of water vapor adsorbed by soils is very sensitive to changes in atmospheric forcing and surface variables.

Over the last few decades, {{there has been an}} ever growing interest in the fabrication of nanowire structures {{for a wide variety of}} applications including energy generation purposes. Nevertheless, the study of their transport properties, such as thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity or Seebeck coefficient, remains an experimental challenge. For instance, in the particular case of nanostructured thermoelectrics, theoretical calculations have shown that nanowires offer a promising way of enhancing the hitherto low efficiency of these materials in the conversion of temperature differences into electricity. Therefore, within the thermoelectrical community there has been a great experimental effort in the measurement of these quantities in actual nanowires. The measurements of these properties at the nanoscale are also of interest in fields other than energy, such as electrical components for microchips, field effect transistors, sensors, and other low scale devices. For all these applications, knowing the transport properties is mandatory. This review deals with the latest techniques developed to perform the measurement of these transport properties in nanowires.

The effect of dams on biofilms was analysed in three tributaries (Cinca, Siurana and Montsant) of the Ebro River (NE Spain). We hypothesized that flow regulation would lead to lower spatial variability of biofilms on the streambed and to a decrease in their metabolic rate per unit biomass, especially during low flow periods. Biofilm characteristics were studied in five transects evenly spaced along river reaches upstream (control) and downstream (impact) of dams in each river, along with riverbed granulometry, hydraulics and water chemistry. Chlorophyll-a, respiratory activity, photosynthetic capacity and efficiency, and extracellular enzymatic activities (β-d-glucosidase, alkaline phosphatase and leucine-amino-peptidase) of epilithic biofilms were measured in different seasons. Spatial variability of chemical and biological variables was reduced downstream of the dams. Chlorophyll-a concentration, photosynthetic efficiency and respiration capacity were higher in impact than in control reaches, but generally, low inorganic phosphorus concentrations resulted in comparable phosphatase activities downstream and upstream of dams. On the other hand, β-d-glucosidase and leucine-amino-peptidase activities were higher at impact reaches. Biofilms were thicker and metabolically more active at the impact reaches, with higher ability to transform dissolved organic matter.

Owing {{to the accuracy of}} our calculation on Delta S = 2 weak Hamiltonian matrix elements, we are able to provide a refined Unitarity Triangle analysis improving the bounds coming from model independent constraints on New Physics. In our non-perturbative computation we use a combination of N-f = 2 maximally twisted sea quarks and Osterwalder-Seiler valence quarks in order to achieve both O(a) -improvement and continuum-like renormalization properties for the relevant four-fermion operators. The calculation of the renormalization constants has been performed non-perturbatively in the RI-MOM scheme. Based on simulations at four values of the lattice spacing and a number of quark masses we have extrapolated/interpolated our results to the continuum limit and physical light/strange quark masses.

40|$|Decisions on river {{rehabilitation}} {{actions are}} {{often based on}} cost-benefit analyses {{taking into account the}} costs and benefits of the considered management actions, but ecosystem services are often not included as benefits, despite recent evidences on the effects of river rehabilitations on ecosystem services. A cost-benefit analysis integrating market and non-market costs and benefits was undertaken in this study to assess the economic feasibility of a river rehabilitation project in a water scarce region, the Yarqon River Rehabilitation project (Israel). In this case, the costs included both the capital costs of implementing rehabilitation measures (including maintenance costs) and the opportunity costs of water allocation (foregone benefits to farmers from water provisioning for agriculture). The benefits of rehabilitation included the net marginal benefits of the cultural ecosystem services at local scale (estimated with a hedonic pricing method), and at regional scale (estimated with a value function transfer), in addition to the habitat service gene-pool protection (estimated with a replacement cost method). Bearing in mind the uncertainties surrounding water resource management decisions, especially in water scarce areas, a sensitivity and risk analysis was conducted using an analysis that included both Monte Carlo simulations and the standardized regression coefficients method. The rehabilitation of the Yarqon River provided positive net present values (approximately $ 139 million in 30 -year period). This was thanks to the provision of cultural ecosystem services and despite the high rehabilitation costs, and that the massive water reallocation involved high foregone benefits to farmers. Therefore, these results highlight that river rehabilitation in water scarce regions can be economically viable due to the social amenity demand for urban riversThis research was supported by EU-ITN SANITAS (ITN- 289193), a Marie Curie <b>European</b> <b>Reintegration</b> Grant (PERG 07 -GA- 2010 - 259219) and a Career Integration Grant (PCIG 09 - 2011 - 293365) within the 7 th European Community Framework Programme, and the RYC- 2013 - 14595 from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness.

40|$|Current trends {{indicate}} that {{the duration of the}} period with no surface flow experienced by temporary waterways is increasing. Even though several studies have already characterised the effects of non-flow periods on stream ecosystems, the consequences of their increasing duration remain poorly understood. Replicate artificial streams were used to characterise the effects of the duration of the non-flow period on stream biofilm processes. We hypothesised that increased duration of the non-flow period would differentially influence autotrophic and heterotrophic processes and promote heterotrophy (lower P: R ratios). We aimed to identify possible non-linearities and thresholds in the disturbance-response relationships between the duration of the non-flow period (six treatments) and stream biofilm processes (six ecological variables representing autotrophic or heterotrophic processes). The duration of the non-flow period proved to be important for the balance between autotrophic and heterotrophic processes in stream biofilms, with the autotrophic processes being less resistant but more resilient. Autotrophic and heterotrophic processes also differed in terms of disturbance-response relationships, which were linear for most autotrophic ecological variables and sigmoid logistic for heterotrophic variable. Hence, non-flow periods had an immediate effect on autotrophic processes, but the effect on heterotrophic processes was delayed and completed only after crossing the ecological threshold of complete desiccation. These differences involved a shift towards lower P: R ratios at longer durations of the non-flow period. However, the high resilience of autotrophic processes, mainly related to the ability of diatoms to recover, limited the shift towards lower P: R ratios to the non-flow period and to the first weeks after flow return. This study demonstrates the complex effects of flow intermittency on stream biofilm processes, and emphasises the relevance of the duration of the non-flow period as a predictor of the effects on temporary waterwaysThis research was supported by a Marie Curie <b>European</b> <b>Reintegration</b> Grant (PERG 07 -GA- 2010 - 259219) within the 7 th European Community Framework Programme, by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through its financial support through the project CARBONET (CGL 2011 - 30474 -C 02 - 01) and by the European Union through the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER...|$|R

40|$|The {{effluents}} of {{wastewater treatment}} plants (WWTPs) include a complex mixture of nutrients and pollutants. Nutrients can subsidise autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms, while toxic pollutants can act as stressors, depending, for instance, on their concentration and interactions in the environment. Hence, {{it is difficult to}} predict the overall effect of WWTP effluents on river ecosystem functioning. We assessed the effects of WWTP effluents on river biofilms and ecosystem metabolism in one river segment upstream from a WWTP and three segments downstream from the WWTP and following a pollution gradient. The photosynthetic capacity and enzymatic activity of biofilms showed no change, with the exception of leucine aminopeptidase, which followed the pollution gradient most likely driven by changes in organic matter availability. The effluent produced mixed effects on ecosystem-scale metabolism. It promoted respiration (subsidy effect), probably as a consequence of enhanced availability of organic matter. On the other hand, and despite enhanced nutrient concentrations, photosynthesis-irradiance relationships showed that the effluent partly decoupled primary production from light availability, thus suggesting a stress effect. Overall, WWTP effluents can alter the balance between autotrophic and heterotrophic processes and produce spatial discontinuities in ecosystem functioning along rivers {{as a consequence of the}} mixed contribution of stressors and subsidisersThis research was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and FEDER foundings through the SCARCE Consolider-Ingenio CSD 2009 - 00065 and ABSTRACT CGL 2012 - 35848 projects, and the European Communities 7 th Framework Programme Funding under Grant agreement no. 603629 -ENV- 2013 - 6. 2. 1 -Globaqua.

40|$|Spatial {{differences}} in the supply and demand of ecosystem services such as water provisioning often imply that the demand for ecosystem services cannot be fulfilled at the local scale, {{but it can be}} fulfilled at larger scales (regional, continental). Differences in the supply:demand (S:D) ratio for a given service result in different values, and these differences might be assessed with monetary or non-monetary metrics. Water scarcity occurs where and when water resources are not enough to meet all the demands, and this affects equally the service of water provisioning and the ecosystem needs. In this study we assess the value of water in a Mediterranean basin under different global change (i. e. both climate and anthropogenic changes) and mitigation scenarios, with a non-monetary metric: the S:. D ratio. We computed water balances across the Ebro basin (North-East Spain) with the spatially explicit InVEST model. We highlight the spatial and temporal mismatches existing across a single hydrological basin regarding water provisioning and its consumption, considering or not, the environmental demand (environmental flow). The study shows that water scarcity is commonly a local issue (sub-basin to region), but that all demands are met at the largest considered spatial scale (basin). This was not the case in the worst-case scenario (increasing demands and decreasing supply), as the S:. D ratio at the basin scale was near 1, indicating that serious problems of water scarcity might occur in the near future even at the basin scale. The analysis of possible mitigation scenarios reveals that the impact of global change may be counteracted by the decrease of irrigated areas. Furthermore, the comparison between a non-monetary (S:D ratio) and a monetary (water price) valuation metrics reveals that the S:. D ratio provides similar values and might be therefore used as a spatially explicit metric to valuate the ecosystem service water provisioningThis project was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through the SCARCE project (Consolider-Ingenio 2010 CSD 2009 - 00065), and by a Marie Curie <b>European</b> <b>Reintegration</b> Grant (PERG 07 -GA- 2010 - 259219) within the 7 th European Community Framework Programm...|$|R

All rights reserved. We present an analysis of a suite of simulations run with different particle- and grid-based cosmological hydrodynamical codes and compare them with observational data of the Milky Way. This is the first study to make comparisons of properties of galaxies simulated with particle- and grid-based codes. Our analysis indicates that there is broad agreement between these different modelling techniques. We study the velocity dispersion-age relation for disc stars at z= 0 and find that four of the simulations are more consistent with observations by Holmberg, Nordstroem & Andersen in which the stellar disc appears to undergo continual/secular heating. Two other simulations are in better agreement with the Quillen & Garnett observations that suggest 'saturation' in the heating profile for young stars in the disc. None of the simulations has thin discs as old as that of the Milky Way. We also analyse the kinematics of disc stars {{at the time of their}} birth for different epochs in the galaxies' evolution and find that in some simulations old stars are born cold within the disc and are subsequently heated, while other simulations possess old stellar populations which are born relatively hot. The models which are in better agreement with observations of the Milky Way's stellar disc undergo significantly lower minor-merger/assembly activity after the last major merger, that is, once the disc has formed. All of the simulations are significantly 'hotter' than the Milky Way disc; on top of the effects of mergers, we find a 'floor' in the dispersion that is related to the underlying treatment of the heating and cooling of the interstellar medium, and the low density threshold which such codes use for star formation. This finding has important implications for all studies of disc heating that use hydrodynamical codesELH acknowledges the support of the UK’s Science & Technology Facilities Council through its PhD studentship programme (ST/F 006764 / 1).

40|$|Temperate forests {{managed to}} {{maximize}} sustainable yield of wood products {{can reduce the}} availability of dead wood {{on the forest floor}} and in adjacent streams, which in turn can impair ecological processes such as retention and transformation of organic matter. Lack of tools to link ecological processes with their effects on human well-being leads forest managers to ignore the cost on other services from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. We examine how adding dead wood to restore stream channel complexity affects the provision and value of selected ecosystem services, mainly related to the retention and transformation of matter and cycling of nutrients, {{as well as to the}} effects on aquatic biota. Specifically, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of stream restoration through a comparative analysis of four reach-scale projects in streams flowing through temperate forest and into a drinking water reservoir and two scenarios of active and passive restoration at the basin scale. Results indicate that the lack of dead wood in streams has an important economic cost because of the effects on fish provisioning, opportunities for recreation and tourism, water purification and erosion control. Active reach-scale restoration resulted in a 10 - to 100 -fold increase in the monetary benefits provided by streams, accounting as much as 1 · 8 € per metre of restored river length each year. Results of the reach-scale cost-benefit analyses estimated that the time required to recover the active restoration investment ranged from 15 to 20 years in low- to middle-order streams. Synthesis and applications. Our study showed that restoration of natural wood loading in streams greatly increases the ecosystem services they provide. The benefits in terms of the analysed services surpass the costs of active restoration over realistic timeframes, whereas this was not the case for passive restoration. Inclusion of other ecosystem services such as conservation of biodiversity might make restoration more economically profitable. Overall, our study provides a decision framework for managing temperate riparian forests in the context of ecological services.

In the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, LRs originate {{from a group of}} stem cells deep within the root, necessitating that new organs emerge through overlying root tissues. We report that the circadian clock is rephased during LR development. Metabolite and transcript profiling revealed that the circadian clock controls the levels of auxin and auxin-related genes including the auxin response repressor IAA 14 and auxin oxidase AtDAO 2. Plants lacking or overexpressing core clock components exhibit LR emergence defects. We conclude that the circadian clock acts to gate auxin signalling during LR development to facilitate organ emergence.

We present a new morphological indicator designed for automated recognition of galaxies with faint asymmetric tidal features suggestive of an ongoing or past merger. We use the new indicator, together with pre-existing diagnostics of galaxy structure to study the role of galaxy mergers in inducing (post-) starburst spectral signatures in local galaxies, and investigate whether (post-) starburst galaxies {{play a role in the}} build-up of the ‘red sequence’. Our morphological and structural analysis of an evolutionary sample of 335 (post-) starburst galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR 7 with starburst ages 0 < tSB < 0. 6 Gyr, shows that 45 [*]per[*]cent of galaxies with young starbursts (tSB < 0. 1 Gyr) show signatures of an ongoing or past merger. This fraction declines with starburst age, and we find a good agreement between automated and visual classifications. The majority of the oldest (post-) starburst galaxies in our sample (tSB ∼ 0. 6 Gyr) have structural properties characteristic of early-type discs and are not as highly concentrated as the fully quenched galaxies commonly found on the ‘red sequence’ in the present day Universe. This suggests that, if (post-) starburst galaxies are a transition phase between active star-formation and quiescence, they do not attain the structure of presently quenched galaxies within the first 0. 6 Gyr after the starburst.

We find that the unification of the German research network accelerated rapidly during the 1990 s, but then stagnated at an intermediate level of integration. We then study {{the integration of the}} 20 largest academic fields (by number of publications prior to 1990), finding an inverted U-shaped relationship between each field's East or West "dominance" (a measure of the East-West concentration of a field's scholarly output prior to 1990) and the fields' subsequent level of integration. We checked for the robustness of these results by running Monte Carlo simulations and a differences-in-differences analysis. Both methods confirmed that fields that were dominated by either West or East Germany prior to reunification integrated less than those whose output was balanced. Finally, we explored the origins of this inverted U-shaped relationship by considering the tendency of scholars from a given field to collaborate with scholars from similarly productive regions.

It analyzes the cultural and political phenomenon of mestizofilia in 1920 s Mexico, examining the national and international ideological crosscurrents that shaped it. This first chapter uses post-colonial and anthropological paradigms to explore the concept of the Other as a Western construct that objectifies the primitive, and rationalizes colonialism. ^ Chapter two of the dissertation examines the history of thought on race mixing in Mexico, from the Conquest to the Revolution of 1910. The study looks at the effects of Western models for assimilation of the ethnic Other in New Spain and Mexico, as well as examines how negative European stereotypes of the primitive influenced Latin Americans 2 ̆ 7 collective self-perception. ^ Chapter three of the dissertation studies the ideological polemic of early 20 th century between science and culture, and how it affected notions of the primitive as related to the post-revolutionary project of national construction. This chapter highlights the thought of three writers whose ideas express the socio-political and aesthetic sensibilities of the era: Manuel Gamio, premier Mexican anthropologist during the Revolutionary period; José Vasconcelos, writer/philosopher and Minister of Education under Obregón; and D. H. Lawrence, British travel writer and novelist who resided in Mexico during the mid- 1920 s.

40|$|Post-starburst {{galaxies are}} a rare {{class of objects}} with unusual spectroscopic characteristics. Previous {{studies have shown that}} the {{presence}} of strong Balmer absorption lines in the spectra of these galaxies are consistent with a recent bust of star formation; however, the cause of such events remains unclear. Their environment and disturbed morphology suggest that many of them are likely remnants of gas-rich mergers of galaxies with comparable masses and models of galaxy mergers support that claim; however, some studies disagree and the origin of these curious systems remains an open debate. Post-starburst galaxies are also often regarded as a plausible transition channel between the blue continuously star-forming and quiescent red galaxies, commonly observed in the local Universe. This is supported by models of merger- driven starbursts, which cause structural transformation of galaxies consistent with evolution towards the red population, and can ultimately lead to quenching of star formation in the merger remnant; however, observational evidence for this scenario remains elusive. In my study I aimed to place further constraints on the role of galaxy mergers in triggering starbursts in local galaxies and to investigate whether the post-starburst galaxies are indeed in transition between the star-forming and passive phases of galaxy evolution, by the analysis of the morphology and structure of galaxies with spectroscopic signatures of a recent starburst. An important difference between this work and many previous studies is the post-starburst sample selection. Traditionally, post-starburst galaxies are selected to have completely quenched their star-formation; here, I also considered those which show spectroscopic sign of residual star-formation, selected using a method introduced by Wild et al. (2007). I have also followed a different approach to quantifying the morphology of galaxies, by means of an automated method for detecting visual post-merger signatures in galaxies, introduced as a part of this work. My analysis suggests that major mergers play a significant role in inducing starbursts in local Universe, but their significance declines as a function of the stellar mass of the galaxies. I also found that post-starburst galaxies have different structural properties in the low- and high-mass regimes and concluded that they are likely to be transitioning between the blue and red galaxy populations through a multi-stage scenario where both major and minor mergers are at play. <b>European</b> Career <b>Reintegration</b> Grant Phiz-Ev (P.
