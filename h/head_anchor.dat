The results of research initiated {{in the early}} 1980 s led to the replacement of plasticity-based design guidelines for the load-carrying capacity (concrete breakout) of <b>headed</b> <b>anchors</b> embedded in concrete with those developed using fracture mechanics. While provisions {{are available in the}} design codes that account for the presence of tensile fields causing concrete cracking, no provisions are available for anchors embedded in prestressed concrete. This thesis presents the results of linear and nonlinear elastic fracture mechanics analyses of the progressive failure of <b>headed</b> <b>anchors</b> embedded in a concrete matrix under compressive or tensile prestress. In addition, and because of the complete lack of experimental evidence, the results of a relatively large experimental investigation of the behavior of <b>headed</b> <b>anchors</b> embedded in compressively prestressed concrete are presented. Discrete crack finite element models and experiments predict an increase (decrease) in load-carrying capacity and post-peak dissipated energy with increasing compressive (tensile) prestress for all the embedment depths investigated. For extremely shallow cases, in which the embedment depth is less than the (typical) maximum aggregate size of concrete, it is shown that deterministic continuum-based models are not applicable. Overall, the results show that there is very little difference between the linear elastic and nonlinear elastic fracture mechanics approaches, this implying that the concrete breakout strength is governed by the strongest possible size effect. In addition to providing analytical support to the existing design approaches for the capacity of <b>headed</b> <b>anchors</b> embedded in cracked concrete (under tension), the present work provides an experimentally and analytically based preliminary easy-to-use design formula for the concrete breakout capacity of <b>headed</b> <b>anchors</b> in compressively prestressed concrete...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} paper the {{influence}} of the crack width on the concrete cone failure load of <b>headed</b> <b>anchors</b> embedded in concrete is analyzed. The analysis is carried out on a reinforced concrete thick plate specimen using three-dimensional finite elements and the non local microplane model. In order to introduce precracking into the specimen before loading the <b>headed</b> <b>anchor,</b> the specimen is loaded in longitudinal direction by applying tension forces through reinforcement. At different crack levels pull-out of the fastening element is performed. Results of the analysis show that the concrete cone failure load is decreasing with increasing crack width up to &# 969; ~ 0. 15 mm to approximately 70 % of the failure load obtained for non-cracked concrete. Further increase of the crack width does not cause further decrease of the failure load. Comparison between numerical and experimental results indicates good agreement...|$|R
40|$|While {{provisions}} {{are available in}} the current design codes that account for the presence of tensile fields causing concrete cracking, no {{provisions are}} available for anchors embedded in compressively prestressed concrete. Because of this lack of information, a series of experiments were performed to evaluate the tensile breakout capacity of <b>headed</b> <b>anchors</b> embedded in confined and unconfined concrete. To simulate the confinement, uniform biaxial compression (prestress) was applied to concrete specimens in the directions orthogonal to the anchors’ stems. This paper discusses the influence of embedment depth and confinement on the behavior of <b>headed</b> <b>anchors</b> in terms of strength, ductility, and failure pattern. A comparison between actual code provisions for unconfined concrete and the experimental results reported herein is provided.

40|$|Various {{anchorage}} systems {{including both}} cast-in-place and post-installed anchors {{have been developed}} for fastening both non-structural and structural components to concrete structures. The need for increased flexibility in the design of new structures and strengthening of existing concrete structures has led to increased use of various metallic anchors in practice. Although millions of fasteners are used each year in the construction industry around the world, knowledge of the fastening technology remains poor. In a sustainable society, buildings and structures must, from time to time, be adjusted to meet new demands. Loads on structures must, in general, be increased to comply with new demands, and the structural components and the structural connections must also be upgraded. From the structural connection point of view, the adequacy of the current fastenings for the intended increased load must be determined, and inadequate fastenings must either be replaced or upgraded. The current design models are generally believed to be conservative, although the extent of this behavior is not very clear. To address these issues, the current models must be refined to allow the design of new fastenings and also the assessment of current anchorage systems in practice. The research presented in this thesis consists of numerical and experimental studies of the load-carrying capacity of anchors in concrete structures. Two different types of anchors were studied: (I) cast-in-place <b>headed</b> <b>anchors,</b> and (II) post-installed adhesive anchors. This research focused particularly on the tensile load-carrying capacity of cast-in-place <b>headed</b> <b>anchors</b> and also on the sustained tension loading performance of post-installed adhesive anchors. The overall objective of this research was to provide knowledge for the development of improved methods of designing new fastening systems and assessing the current anchorage systems in practice. For the cast-in-place <b>headed</b> <b>anchors</b> (I), the influence of various parameters including the size of <b>anchor</b> <b>head,</b> thickness of concrete member, amount of orthogonal surface reinforcement, presence of concrete cracks, concrete compressive strength, and addition of steel fibers to concrete were studied. Among these parameters, the influence of the <b>anchor</b> <b>head</b> size, member thickness, surface reinforcement, and cracked concrete was initially evaluated via numerical analysis of <b>headed</b> <b>anchors</b> at various embedment depths. Although these parameters have considerable influence on the anchorage capacity and performance, this influence is not explicitly considered by the current design models. The numerical results showed that the tensile breakout capacity of <b>headed</b> <b>anchors</b> increases with increasing member thickness and/or increasing size of the <b>anchor</b> <b>head</b> or the use of orthogonal surface reinforcement. However, their capacity decreased considerably in cracked concrete. Based on the numerical results, the current theoretical model for the tensile breakout capacity of <b>headed</b> <b>anchors</b> was extended by incorporating several modification factors that take the influence of the investigated parameters into account. In addition, a supplementary experimental study was performed to verify the numerically obtained findings and the proposed refined model. The experimental results corresponded closely to the numerical results, both in terms of failure load and failure pattern, thereby confirming the validity of the proposed model. The validity of the model was further confirmed through experimental results reported in the literature. Additional experiments were performed to determine the influence of the concrete compressive strength and the addition of steel fiber to concrete on the anchorage capacity and performance. These experiments showed that the anchorage capacity and stiffness increase considerably with increasing concrete compressive strength, but the ductility of the anchor decreases. However, the anchorage capacity and ductility increased significantly with the addition of steel fibers to the concrete mixture. The test results also revealed that the tensile breakout capacity of <b>headed</b> <b>anchors</b> in steel fiber-reinforced concrete is significantly underestimated by the current design model. The long-term performance and creep behavior of the post-installed <b>headed</b> <b>anchors</b> (II) was evaluated from the results of long-time tests on adhesive anchors under sustained loads. In this experimental study, adhesive anchors of various sizes were subjected to various sustained load levels for up to 28 years. The anchors were also exposed to several in-service conditions including indoor temperature, variations in the outdoor temperature and humidity, wetness (i. e., water on the surface of concrete), and the presence of salt (setting accelerant) additives in the concrete. Among the tested in-service conditions, variations in the outdoor temperature and humidity had the most adverse effect on the long-term sustained loading performance of the anchors. Based on the test results, recommendations were proposed for maximum sustained load levels under various conditions. The anchors tested under indoor conditions could carry sustained loads of up to 47 % of their mean ultimate short-term capacities. However, compared with these anchors, the anchors tested under outdoor conditions exhibited larger creep deformation and failure occurred at sustained loads higher than 23 % of their mean ultimate short-term capacities. Salt additives in concrete and wet conditions had negligible influence on the long-term performance of the anchors, although the wet condition resulted in progressive corrosion of the steel. Based on the experimental results, the suitability of the current testing and approval provisions for qualifying adhesive anchors subjected to long-term sustained tensile loads was evaluated. The evaluations revealed that the current approval provisions are not necessarily reliable for qualifying adhesive anchors for long-term sustained loading applications. Recommendations were given for modifying the current provisions to ensure safe long-term performance of adhesive anchors under sustained loads...|$|R

Failure to stay current with new design procedures can result in liberal design solutions. The historical overview discusses the chronology of design methods based on various boundary conditions and load applications.
