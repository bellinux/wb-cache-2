He blackmails her into remarrying him as he alludes that he has information on the music box that Katherine once told him. However, his information ends up being a dead end. After Colin's lies are exposed, Jill locks him in the attic and refuses to let him out until he owns up to his lies, which he eventually does and they patch things up. Almost a year after Katherine's death, Jill finds her most expensive jewelry to have been hidden in a chandelier at the Chancellor Estate. Enclosed with a note, Katherine left them there for Jill to find before her death as they are worth a significant amount. However, {{the meaning of the}} music box continues to remain unknown to everyone. Afterward, all of Katherine's loved ones receive letters from her that were to be delivered on the one-year anniversary of her death. She also asks them to throw a party and celebrate, which they do. Once the party in the park is finished, Jill leaves the music box there, only for it to be stolen by an unidentified person. Jill and Colin return soon after to find the box missing, but Colin convinces her to finally let <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

The McGees won their house in a raffle from Mr. Hagglemeyer's Wistful Vista Development Company, with lottery ticket #131,313, happened upon by chance while on a pleasure drive in their car. With blowhard McGee wavering between mundane tasks and hare-brained schemes (like digging an oil well in the back yard), antagonizing as many people as possible, and patient Molly indulging his foibles and providing loving support, not to mention a tireless parade of neighbors and friends {{in and out of the}} quiet home, Fibber McGee and Molly built its audience steadily, but once it found the full volume of that audience in 1940, they rarely let <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

In {{contrast to the}} relaxed Los Angeles sessions, which Godrich described as [...] "very fruitful", mixing and sequencing the album created conflict. Yorke said: [...] "We had massive arguments {{about how it was}} put together and mixed ... For the first time it was really good fun to make a record... but we finished it and nobody could let <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> 'Cause there was a long sustained period during which we lived with it but it wasn't completely finished, so you get attached to versions and we had big rows about it." [...] Godrich estimated that rough mixes from the Los Angeles sessions were used for a third of the final album.|$|E

Talking to We Love Telly, asked whether it's {{important}} for Kat to see Charlie again, Wallace replied: [...] "Yes, definitely. With what happened the night they thought Tommy died, things were still unresolved for them. Although they cleared the air before he left, things weren't right between them, so to have him back with her now {{makes it all the}} more special. It's also Charlie that makes Kat realise that she needs to bond with Tommy. He makes her see that she can do this." [...] Discussing what type of mother Kat will be, Wallace added: [...] "I think she wants to be the best mum possible. She knows that this is her second chance to make a <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and she is determined to do a good job." ...|$|E

It's nothing personal, either. We all feel like that band said what it needed to say. It would feel weird and awkward to play that music again.
