40|$|To {{illustrate}} {{the use of}} mixture theory to simultaneously optimize the macrocation and the macroanion composition of a hydroponical nutrient solution, a { 3, 2; 3, 2 } double lattice design {{was established in the}} double mixture factor space (K+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +,NO 3 -, H 2 PO 4 - and SO 42 -). Only one response variable was considered: the calcium content of <b>English</b> <b>ryegrass.</b> The macronutrient composition significantly affected the calcium content of the ryegrass. A reduced second-degree double mixture model with 20 instead of 36 parameters was selected to represent the response surface over the experimental region. The macrocation composition had a more pronounced effect on the calcium content of the ryegrass than the macroanion composition. (C) 2001 Silsoe Research Institute. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare {{carbohydrate}} degradation of forages which store carbohydrates either predominantly as fructan or starch, in horses' hindgut. The effects of an abrupt change from hay-based feeding to green fodder-based feeding on the caecal flora were tested with the in vitro hindgut simulation technique 'Caesitec'. Six trials with different forages (<b>English</b> <b>ryegrass,</b> tall fescue, grass mixture-horses, grass mixture-cows, lucerne, white clover) were conducted. During a 4 -day stabilisation period, samples were taken once a day before loading the fermenters with hay. After diet-change to forage-based feeding, samples were taken four times a day. Ammonia and pH-value were measured before and 1, 2 and 6  h after loading the 'Caesitec'. Gas formation was measured daily. Bacterial numbers, lactate and short chain fatty acids were detected at four time-points of each trial. The grass mixtures contained the highest amounts of fructan. The pH-values were in the physiological range from pH 6 up to 7 (6. 58 - 6. 83) by feeding all forages. Gas formation, anaerobic and aerobic bacterial numbers increased after diet change from hay to any forage. The maximum amount of fructan (3. 75  g/kg) in swiss pasture did not cause a permanent pathological change in the hindgut-flora...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to improve an in vitro system in order to collect data on the {{digestion}} of different forages in the horse´s upper gastro-intestinal tract. Therefore, in vitro foregut digestion of several forages (grass mixture for horses, grass mixture for cows (GMC), tall fescue, <b>English</b> perennial <b>ryegrass</b> (ER), white clover, lucerne) was performed in two phases with pepsin and amylase, whereas microbial fermentation was neglected. The results are consistent with current data from in vivo studies, including a degradation of crude protein and monosaccharides as well as a relative increase of fibres. Interestingly, a loss of fructan was measured in two feedstuffs (ER/GMC). As acid hydrolysis was suspected to be responsible for this, the effect of different pH-values (2, 3 and 4) on the fructan degradation of ER and GMC was tested subsequently. As expected, the highest degradation of protein was shown at the lowest pH (protein in ER/GMC at pH 2 : 6. 1 / 8. 2 % DM and at pH 4 : 7. 7 / 10. 6 % DM), whereas fructan degradation was highest at pH 4 (fructan in ER/GMC at pH 2 : 1. 63 / 1. 95 % DM and at pH 4 : 1. 31 / 0. 91 % DM). We presume that not only acidic hydrolysis but also plant enzymes cause the loss of fructans in an acidic environment...|$|R

Los métodos de siembra utilizados fueron: a) alfalfa y gramíneas sembradas al voleo, b) alfalfa y gramíneas en el mismo surco, c) alfalfa y gramíneas en surcos alternos, d) alfalfa en surcos y gramíneas al voleo y e) alfalfa en surcos y trébol blanco al voleo. &# 13; &# 13; En el segundo experimento se sembró la alfalfa en surcos separados 25 cm. Después de establecida la alfalfa e inmediatamente después del 4 ° corte se sembraron al voleo las siguientes gramíneas: ryegrass inglés, rygrass anual, orchoro, festuca media, pasto cinta y pasto rescate. &# 13; &# 13; Las finalidades del estudio fueron las de valorar {{el comportamiento}} de las gramíneas en mezcla con la alfalfa, mediante la determinación progresiva de la composición botánica y el rendimiento de forraje seco de las mezclas. &# 13; &# 13; La siembra simultánea de ryegrass inglés y ryegrass anual con la alfalfa dio como resultado una mala población de la leguminosa, especialmente en los dos primeros cortes. La competencia ejercida por estas dos gramíneas a la alfalfa, se redujo casi completamente, cuando se sembraron en surcos alternos o en la alfalfa establecida. &# 13; &# 13; Sea cual fuere el pasto sembrado, la siembra de gramíneas en alfalfa establecida, redujo la competencia entre los pastos asociados. En este ensayo el factor más importante en el establecimiento de las gramíneas, fue el agua disponible en el suelo. &# 13; Bajo las condiciones del primer experimento el orchoro fue la gramínea que mejor creció en asocio de la alfalfa en todos los métodos de siembra estudiado. La producción promedia de la mezcla varió entre 2600 y 3145 Kg/hect. De forreje seco por corte y la proporción de orchoro entre 36 y 52 %, en comparación con la alfalfa su producción fue inferior en un 4 a 10 %. &# 13; La producción promedia de forraje de las mezclas alfalfa ryegrass anual, en la siembra de gramíneas en alfalfa establecida fue de 2345 Kg. /hect, de forraje seco por corte en comparación con 2340 de la alfalfa sola. El 55 % de la producción total de forraje la proporcionó la gramínea. &# 13; El agua recibida entre los cortes tuvo una influencia bastante marcada en las fluctuaciones de la composición botánica. &# 13; De acuerdo con los resultados de este estudio y como práctica agrícola, la siembra simultánea de alfalfa en mezcla con ryegrass inglés, ryegrass anual y orchoro, en este tipo de suelo, sería aconsejable hacerla mediante los siguientes métodos:&# 13; a) Alfalfa-orchoro. Alfalfa en surcos separados 25 cm. A razón de 15 Kg. /hect, de semilla y orchoro al voleo con una densidad de siembra de 6 Kg. /hect. Se puede utilizar también la siembra en el mismo surco para facilitar la siembra total a máquina. &# 13; b) Alfalfa-ryegrass inglés, alfalfa-ryegrass annual. Leguminosas y gramíneas en surcos alternos, 7 Kg. /hect. de alfalfa por 4 kg. /hect. de ryegrass inglés o anual. &# 13; c) En la alfalfa catablecida puede sembrarse al voleo cualquier gramínea sin que se presente mucha competencia para la alfalfa. /Abstract Two experiments {{were conducted with}} mixtures of grasses and alfalfa on the soil series. Sabana de Bogotá, a clay loam, at the National Center of Agricultural Investigation, Tibaitatá. &# 13; In the first experiments alfalfa was seeded {{at the same time}} as English rygrass, Italian rygrass, orchard grass and white clover. &# 13; The mixtures were seeded in the following manner: a) Alfalfa and grasses broadcast, b) in the same row, c) in the alternate rows, d) alfalfa in rows and the grasses broadcast, and e) alfalfa in rows and white clover broadcast. &# 13; In the second experiment the alfalfa was planted in rows 25 cm. apart. After the fourth uniform hervest the following grasses were broadcast between the alfalfa rows: <b>English</b> rygrass, Italian <b>ryegrass,</b> orchard, meadow fescue, fescue and Harding grass. &# 13; &# 13; The objectives of these studies were to determine the feasibility and potential value of certain alfalfa-grass mixtures as measured by forage vields and the botanical composition. &# 13; &# 13; A very low population of alfalfa occurred when seeded {{at the same time as}} the <b>English</b> and Italian <b>ryegrass</b> because of the rapid seedling with the grasses. By establishing alfalfa first and later overseeding with the grasses, the seedling competition was eliminated, thus resulting in a satisfactory alfalta-grass combination. In the second experiment soil moisture was the most important factor in the establishment of the grasses. &# 13; Under the conditions of the simultaneous seeding, the orchard grass grew well in association with alfalfa in all of the methods of varied between 2600 and 3145 Kg. /hect. of dry matter and the proportion of grass fluctuated between 36 and 52 %. The yield of the alfalfa alone exceeded that of mixture by 4 to 10 %. In the second experiment whereby orchard-grass was seeded in an old stand of alfalfa, the orchard reacted in a similar manner. &# 13; The production of the alfalfa-ryegrass in the seeding of grasses in established alfalfa averaged 2345 Kg. /hect. of dry hay in comparison with 2345 of alfalfa alone. In the grass-alfalfa mixtures the ryegrass contributed 55 % of the forage as compared to about 90 % in the simultaneously seeded experiment. This figure represents the proportion of grass in the first harvests. Later the percent of grass dropped to about 65 %. &# 13; In the both experiments the rainfall between harvests markedly influenced the botanical composition, there being more alfalfa during the dry periods. &# 13; According at the results of the present study, when alfalfa is planted at the same tie and in mixture with orchard grass, <b>English</b> and Italian <b>ryegrass,</b> on the soil type Sabana of Bogotá, it would be advisable to use the following procedures:&# 13; a) Alfalfa-orchard. Alfalfa should be seeded in 25 cm. rows at 15 Kg. /hect. and the orchard broadcast at a rate of 6 Kg. /hect. The two species might also be placed in the same row to facilitate the sceding with a drill. &# 13; b) Alfalfa-ryegrass. The two species should be planted in alternate rows, alfalfa 10 Kg. /hect. and ryegrass 4 Kg. /hect. &# 13; &# 13; The results of interseeding grasses in establish alfalfa demonstrated tha this method resulted in the establish of the grasses and eliminated the seeding competition of the components...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Perennial legumes, alfalfa, red clover, bird's foot trefoil, white clover, {{sainfoin}} and grasses, cock's foot, meadow fescue, tall fescue, Italian ryegrass, <b>English</b> <b>ryegrass,</b> French ryegrass, {{red fescue}} and Timothy grass {{can be grown}} successfully in pure crops and in legume-grass mixtures, on different soil types. Their importance in livestock development is based primarily on the great potential for yield of dry matter of over 20 t ha- 1 if adequate agro-technical measures have been applied. Also, perennial legumes are characterized with high content of nutritive substances, especially protein and represent the most important protein source in livestock nutrition. Depending on the species and pheno stage of utilization, the content of crude proteins in grasses varies from 100 to 174, 6 g kg- 1 of DM, and in perennial legumes from 190, 0 to 228, 8 g kg- 1 of DM. Livestock feed obtained from these plant species {{can be used in}} several ways, from grazing as most efficient and economical way, to preparation of hay and high quality silages and haylages. Stated forage species are very important in sustainable agriculture and organic production, considering that they carry out the process of biological fixation of nitrogen, but also from the ecological aspect. By using diverse selection/breeding material numerous domestic cultivars of perennial legumes and grasses have been created which are characterized with high potential for main agronomical traits...|$|E
40|$|Vineyards {{are usually}} managed by tilling the inter-rows to avoid {{competition}} from other plants for soil water and nutrients. However, in humid and sub-humid climates, {{such as that of}} NW Spain, cover crops may be an advantage for controlling vine vegetative growth and improving berry composition, while reducing management costs. The current study was conducted over three consecutive growing seasons (2012 - 2014) to assess the effects of establishing three permanent cover crop treatments on water relations, vine physiology, yield and berry composition of a vineyard of the red cultivar ‘Mencía’ (Vitis vinifera L.) located in Leiro, Ourense. Treatments consisted of four different soil management systems: ST, soil tillage; NV, native vegetation; ER, <b>English</b> <b>ryegrass</b> (Lolium perenne L.); and SC, subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.). Midday stem water potential was more negative in the native vegetation treatment, causing significant reductions in leaf stomatal conductance on certain dates. Total vine leaf area and pruning weight was reduced in the cover crop treatments {{in the last year of}} the experiment. Yield was unaffected by the presence of a cover crop. No significant differences among treatments were observed for berry composition; however, wines were positively affected by the SC treatment (higher tannin content and colour intensity and lower malic acid concentration when compared with ST). Wines from the cover crop treatments were preferred by taste panelists. These results indicate that in humid climates cover crop treatments can be useful for reducing vine vegetative growth without compromising yield and berry quality...|$|E
40|$|In two {{replicated}} trials we initially {{aimed to}} investigate positional foraging preferences in stabled horses {{presented with a}} standard forage. Using the same protocol we then investigated preferences for single and multiple forage sources and interactions with the effect of location. Ten stabled horses, four females and six geldings, aged from 18 months to 21 years, maintained at Writtle College Stud took part in these trials. In Trial 1 four 60 litre containers holding 2. 7 kg of chopped <b>English</b> <b>ryegrass</b> were located in {{the centre of the}} front, back, left and right walls of the horses' 3. 5 m 2 Monarch-style loose-boxes. In Trial 2 three containers each containing 2. 7 kg of forage (chopped Italian ryegrass, chopped timothy, chopped alfalfa) and one container containing 2. 7 kg of an equal parts mixture of these three forages (i. e. 0. 9 kg of each forage) were presented in the same locations according to a Latin Square design to control for location order effects. In both trials the horses' behaviour was recorded for 30 minutes using wall mounted video cameras. Data was harvested from tapes according to an 11 behaviour mutually exclusive ethogram using the Observer v. 5 package and analysed using SPSS v. 12. Data were analysed using Freidman's analysis. In Trial 1 a significant difference in position was found with total foraging duration greatest in the front position (P< 0. 005, df 3, 2 = 14. 0). In Trial 2 a significant difference in duration of foraging was found with highest duration recorded for single ryegrass (P< 0. 001, df 3, 2 = 21. 4). When a variety of forages were presented the effect of location was NS. In these short term trials horses showed a preference for foraging location when a single forage was presented. When a variety of forages were presented single ryegrass was the preferred forage and forage preferences overrode positional preferences...|$|E
30|$|A low {{availability}} of P {{in the soil}} after fertilisation with sewage sludge ash was observed, which translated into a relative fertiliser efficiency based on biomass production of 24 – 41  % and P uptake of 31  %. This result was in line with earlier work, showing that phosphorus in sewage sludge ash is generally not readily taken up by plants [9]. On the other hand, there may be considerable variations between different sewage sludge ashes, depending on the processing of sewage sludge in the water treatment plant [7]. Sewage sludge, Thomas phosphate and sewage sludge-enriched BOF slag (LDS/SSA) all resulted in levels of available P similar to or higher than TSP. In fact, fertilisation with LDS/SSA resulted in a significantly higher level of PH 2 O compared to TSP. This was probably related {{to an increase in}} soil pH from ~ 5.6 in the TSP treatment to ~ 6.5 in the LDS/SSA treatment (Additional file 1 : Table S 1), since the {{availability of}} phosphates in soil is generally highest close to neutrality [59]. Severin et al. [9] found that the LDS/SSA product had high efficiency as a P fertiliser [9] in accordance with this study’s results, yielding a P-fertilisation effect comparable to TSP. This shows the potential of this technology to produce a highly effective P fertiliser, partly based on sewage sludge devoid of any organic contaminants. However, the content of heavy metals could potentially be problematic. The content of Cr (1712  mg kg− 1, data not shown) for instance is above the current Danish limits [60], while in Germany contents above 300  mg kg− 1 have to be declared [61]. An alternative to using sewage sludge ash could be to use sewage sludge as a fertiliser instead. Concerns may be raised regarding organic contaminants and problematic microorganisms, which are not relevant in the case of sewage sludge ash. However, organic contaminants probably do not pose a great threat here when the quality of present-day sewage sludge is taken into account [4]. In the present study, sewage sludge was observed to possess high potential as a P fertiliser, resulting in responses that are 76 – 106  % of those observed when using TSP. This was in relatively good agreement with a pot trial using <b>English</b> <b>ryegrass</b> in which the efficiency of different sludges was 62 – 86  % of monocalcium phosphate [62]. In the case of wood and straw ash, {{it was not possible to}} clearly evaluate their potential as P fertilisers based on the results presented here. This was due to the fact that (i) the CULS experiment lacked a positive control with the addition of a comparable level of total P and (ii) the input of P with the two different ash types was different. These problems aside, from the results presented here, it would not appear that wood ash and straw ash have great potential as P fertilisers, since the relative increase in biomass yield was not above 25  % in comparison to the HK Kalke and UCPH experiments showing yield increases of 50  % or more, even for sewage sludge ash. This result contradicted an earlier study in which a high P-fertilisation effect was found for rape meal, straw and cereal ashes [63]. However, as observed from the PCA plot, a small effect was observed on the plant elemental composition due to the wood ash and DKP treatments and greater effect of the straw ash treatment, but these differences were not clearly associated with differences in the aboveground biomass. These effects were observed to be independent of soil type. The fibre fraction of pig manure (FFPM) prepared using a decanter centrifuge was shown to have a high fertiliser efficiency that was not significantly lower than the positive TSP control. This was in accordance with previous results showing a high P availability after application of this solid manure fraction to soil [64].|$|E
