40|$|The low {{frictional}} resistance to rock-on-rock sliding reported in large blockslides, in coseismic fault rupture and in laboratory-scale rock friction tests has {{been attributed to}} a variety of causes. Herein we propose a mechanical explanation for the reduced friction, which seems likely to be universally relevant to complement other mechanisms. Rock-on-rock sliding of intact brittle rocks always generates a layer of comminuted debris. Rock must fail in order to form and further comminute debris; at local strain rates >> 100 s- 1, recycling of elastic strain energy stored in accomplishing fragmentation generates instantaneous, local, GPa-range <b>isotropic</b> <b>pressures</b> similar to the rock’s Hugoniot elastic limit (Q). Under rapid strain, simultaneously fragmenting grains deliver large normal forces to the boundaries of the comminuting layer, reducing the confining stress on the debris (and hence its resistance to shear), thus lowering the {{frictional resistance}} to slip. This behaviour corresponds quantitatively to published laboratory data on granite friction; to the dynamics of low-angle blocksliding and faulting; and to our data on rapid shearing of fragmenting dry coal...|$|R

In contrast, simulating the same system with <b>isotropic</b> <b>pressure</b> coupling led to the formation of a cylindrical micelle/lamellar structure with a large water hole. The formation of micelles seems unrealistic since diacylphosphatidylcholines having hydrocarbon tails with nine or more carbon atoms have been shown to form only bilayers. Simulations were also performed with preformed bilayerlike configurations with either anisotropic or <b>isotropic</b> <b>pressure</b> coupling. The bilayer characteristics deduced from simulations using anisotropic pressure coupling are in better agreement with those reported from earlier experimental and simulation studies.

30|$|These {{simulations}} {{have been}} successful at describing many aspects of Titan’s plasma interaction. However, they are all based on the fluid approximation. Gyroradius effects and none <b>isotropic</b> <b>pressures</b> are not described in this approximation. The fluid approximation cannot provide a complete description of the interaction {{because of the size}} of the ion gyroradii near Titan. This issue was recognized early on with initial studies of the kinetic effects being carried out by particle tracing in ideal and MHD fields (cf. Luhmann, 1996; Ledvina et al., 2000, 2004 b, 2005; Tseng et al., 2008). Particle tracing gives a better sense of the importance of gyroradius effects than MHD simulations but it is not self-consistent. There is no feedback between the particle motion and the fields. Self-consistent hybrid simulations (kinetic ions, fluid electrons) have been carried to account for the ion gyroradii effects near Titan (e.g. Brecht et al., 2000; Ledvina et al., 2004 a; Sillanpää et al., 2006; Simon et al., 2006; Modolo et al., 2007; Müller et al., 2010). The major limitation to the hybrid simulation performed to date has been their lack of any description of the ionosphere.|$|R

40|$|We propose {{gravitational}} microlensing {{as a way}} {{of testing}} the emergent gravity theory recently proposed by Eric Verlinde [1]. We consider two limiting cases: the dark mass of maximally anisotropic pressures (Case I) and of <b>isotropic</b> <b>pressures</b> (Case II). Our analysis of perihelion advancement of a planet shows that only Case I yields a viable theory. In this case the metric outside a star of mass M⁎ can be modeled by that of a point-like global monopole whose mass is M⁎ and a deficit angle Δ=(2 GH 0 M⁎) /(3 c 3), where H 0 is the Hubble rate and G the Newton constant. This deficit angle can be used to test the theory since light exhibits additional bending around stars given by, αD≈−πΔ/ 2. This angle is independent on the distance from the star and it affects equally light and massive particles. The effect is too small to be measurable today, but should be within reach of the next generation of high resolution telescopes. Finally we note that the advancement of periastron of a planet orbiting around a star or black hole, which equals πΔ per period, can be also used to test the theory...|$|R

40|$|Shock jump conditions, i. e., the {{specification}} of the downstream {{parameters of the}} gas {{in terms of the}} upstream parameters, are obtained for steady-state, plane shocks with oblique magnetic fields and arbitrary flow speeds. This is done by combining the continuity of particle number flux and the electromagnetic boundary conditions at the shock with the magnetohydrodynamic conservation laws derived from the stress-energy tensor. For ultrarelativistic and nonrelativistic shocks, the jump conditions may be solved analytically. For mildly relativistic shocks, analytic solutions are obtained for <b>isotropic</b> <b>pressure</b> using an approximation for the adiabatic index that is valid in high sonic Mach number cases.
