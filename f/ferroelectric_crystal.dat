25|$|There {{are a few}} crystal structures, {{notably the}} {{perovskite}} structure, which exhibit ferroelectric behavior.

Upon the application of an electric field of sufficient magnitude, the crystal becomes permanently polarized. This polarization can be reversed by a sufficiently large counter-charge, in the same way that a ferromagnet can be reversed.

50|$|Even {{though the}} {{polarization}} is in principle non-unique, in practice {{it is often}} (not always) defined by convention in a specific, unique way. For example, in a perfectly centrosymmetric crystal, P is usually defined by convention to be exactly zero. As another example, in a <b>ferroelectric</b> <b>crystal,</b> there is typically a centrosymmetric configuration above the Curie temperature, and P is defined there by convention to be zero. As the crystal is cooled below the Curie temperature, it shifts gradually into a more and more non-centrosymmetric configuration. Since gradual changes in P are uniquely defined, this convention gives a unique value of P for the <b>ferroelectric</b> <b>crystal,</b> even below its Curie temperature.|$|E

50|$|Phonon-polaritons {{generated}} in <b>ferroelectric</b> <b>crystals</b> propagate nearly laterally to the excitation pulse {{due to the}} high dielectric constants of <b>ferroelectric</b> <b>crystals,</b> facilitating easy separation of phonon-polaritons from the excitation pulses that generated them.

Lateral propagation is paramount to a polaritonic platform in which generation and propagation take place in a single crystal.

Electrodes of the detector and metallic ring are formed on the same chip of an unpoled single <b>ferroelectric</b> <b>crystal.</b> The coupling of the carrier frequency with the low frequency infrared signal has been demonstrated by various experiments and explained theoretically {{on the basis of}} electrical and mechanical solitary waves 2 in the <b>ferroelectric</b> <b>crystal.</b> These solitary waves give rise to domain wall or electromechanical coupling. The electrical field of the carrier frequency causes growth of domains with polarisation aligned along carrier frequency field and the movement of the domain walls results in domain wall coupling.

Until now the common method for obtaining periodically-poled <b>ferroelectric</b> <b>crystals</b> is by electric-field poling. In this technique local inversion of the spontaneous polarization is produced in a single-domain crystal by applying an electric field on a periodic electrode deposited on the crystal surface. The poling technology for nonlinear crystals like KTiOPO 4, LiNbO 3 and LiTaO 3 is by now reliable to produce QPM gratings with periods down to about 8 µm. But the thickness of the periodically poled slabs is restricted to 1 mm for these gratings periods, which limits their use to low- and medium- power applications...|$|R
