5|$|Two {{protactinium}} oxides were obtained: PaO2 (black) and Pa2O5(white); the <b>former</b> <b>is</b> isomorphic with ThO2 and {{the latter}} is easier to obtain. Both oxides are basic, and Pa(OH)5 is a weak, poorly soluble base.|$|E
5|$|As {{biologists}} define macroevolution, both microevolution and macroevolution {{have been}} observed. Speciations, for example, have been directly observed many times, despite popular misconceptions to the contrary. Additionally, the modern evolutionary synthesis draws no distinction in the processes {{described by the}} theory of evolution when considering macroevolution and microevolution as the <b>former</b> <b>is</b> simply at the species level or above and the latter is below the species level. An example of this is ring species.|$|E
5|$|Knights and Dames Grand Cross {{are also}} {{entitled}} to receive heraldic supporters. Furthermore, they may encircle their arms with a {{depiction of the}} circlet (a red circle bearing the motto) with the badge pendant thereto and the collar; the <b>former</b> <b>is</b> shown either outside or {{on top of the}} latter.|$|E

5|$|Knights and Ladies may {{encircle}} {{their arms}} with the circlet (a green circle bearing the Order's motto) and {{the collar of}} the Order; the <b>former</b> <b>is</b> shown either outside or {{on top of the}} latter. The badge is depicted suspended from the collar. The Royal Arms depict the collar and motto of the Order of the Thistle only in Scotland; they show the circlet and motto of the Garter in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Language and {{personal}} names provide some difficulties. The <b>former</b> <b>is</b> an important indicator of culture {{but there is}} very little direct evidence for its use in specific circumstances during the period under consideration. Pictish, Middle Irish and Old Norse would certainly have been spoken and Woolf (2007) suggests that a significant degree of linguistic balkanisation took place. As a result, single individuals often appear in sources under a variety of different names.|$|E
5|$|Lord Tywin Lannister {{talks with}} his son Jaime while the <b>former</b> <b>is</b> {{skinning}} a stag, symbolic animal of the house Baratheon. While Tywin chastises Jaime for causing the recent troubles with the Starks, he nevertheless believes this war is the perfect opportunity for the Lannisters {{to set up a}} dynasty as the new rulers of the Seven Kingdoms. Tywin gives half of his forces to Jaime to attack Riverrun, the seat of House Tully and Lady Catelyn's childhood home, in retaliation for Catelyn's seizure of Tyrion.|$|E

5|$|Lutetium {{occurs on}} the Earth {{in form of}} two isotopes: lutetium-175 and lutetium-176. Out of these two, only the <b>former</b> <b>is</b> stable, making the element monoisotopic. The latter one, lutetium-176, decays via beta decay with a {{half-life}} of 3.781010 years; it makes up about 2.5% of natural lutetium.|$|E
5|$|Other {{species with}} which the common toad could be {{confused}} include the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) and the European green toad (Bufo viridis). The <b>former</b> <b>is</b> usually smaller and has a yellow band running down its back while the latter has a distinctive mottled pattern. The paratoid glands of both are parallel rather than slanting as in the common toad. The common frog (Rana temporaria) is also similar in appearance {{but it has a}} less rounded snout, damp smooth skin, and usually moves by leaping.|$|E
5|$|Playa de Oro virus (OROV) is a {{probable}} species of hantavirus {{found in the}} rodents Oryzomys couesi and Sigmodon mascotensis in the Mexican state of Colima. The <b>former</b> <b>is</b> {{thought to be the}} main host. The sequences of parts of the virus's RNA-based genome have been determined; they differ by 7–10% in amino acid composition and 22–24% in nucleotide composition from closely related viruses.|$|E

5|$|The Kaivalya Upanishad manuscripts vary, {{depending}} on which Veda it is attached to. The one attached to Krishna Yajurveda has 26 verses, while the edition attached to the Atharvaveda has 24 verses with an epilogue. Both convey the same message, but the <b>former</b> <b>is</b> structured as a single chapter, and the latter into two chapters (19 verses in first, 5 verses in second). The text is structured as verses, set to a poetic Vedic meter (exactly same number of syllables per verse of the song).|$|E
5|$|The iron {{compounds}} {{produced on}} the largest scale in industry are iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4·7H2O) and iron(III) chloride (FeCl3). The <b>former</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the}} most readily available sources of iron(II), but is less stable to aerial oxidation than Mohr's salt ((NH4)2Fe(SO4)2·6H2O). Iron(II) compounds tend to be oxidized to iron(III) compounds in the air.|$|E
5|$|The main festivals celebrated at {{the temple}} include Navarathri and Sivarathri. The <b>former</b> <b>is</b> a nine-day long festival in honour of the {{presiding}} Goddess, while the latter is an overnight observation in honour of Lord Shiva. In addition to these two Hindu festivals, the temple has a festival of its own, the Munneswaram festival, a four-week-long event attended by Hindus and Buddhists.|$|E
50|$|López and Pulga swapped {{roles in}} July 2013 after the <b>former</b> <b>was</b> {{admitted}} to the yearly UEFA Pro Licence course, thus being allowed to serve as head coach in the Italian top flight. The <b>former</b> <b>was</b> sacked from his position on 6 April 2014 by owner Massimo Cellino, this being the 36th manager change he went through in 22 years of tenure.|$|R
5000|$|As the map indicates, {{the present}} system {{consists}} of one straight line, originating at Sannomiya Station and terminating at Kobe Airport Station, and a loop attached {{to the middle of}} the straight line.

5|$|There are 34 known {{isotopes}} of francium {{ranging in}} atomic mass from 199 to 232. Francium has seven metastable nuclear isomers. Francium-223 and francium-221 {{are the only}} isotopes that occur in nature, though the <b>former</b> <b>is</b> far more common.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} ways of doing this: a {{two-stage}} process involving roasting followed by blast furnace extraction, carried out in separate vessels; or a direct {{process in which the}} extraction of the concentrate occurs in a single vessel. The latter has become the most common route, though the <b>former</b> <b>is</b> still significant.|$|E
5|$|Two hot {{beverages}} that Palestinians consume is coffee—served in {{the morning}} and throughout the day—and tea which is often sipped in the evening. Tea is usually flavored with na'ana (mint) or maramiyyeh (sage). The coffee of choice is usually Turkish or Arabic coffee. Arabic coffee is similar to Turkish coffee, but the <b>former</b> <b>is</b> spiced with cardamom and is usually unsweetened.|$|E

5|$|Uppercase and {{lowercase}} prefixes are not interchangeable. E.g., {{the quantities}} 1mW and 1MW represent two different quantities; the <b>former</b> <b>is</b> the typical power requirement of {{a hearing aid}} (1milliwatt or 0.001watts), and the latter the typical power requirement of a suburban train (1megawatt or watts).|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{residential}} development continued {{to expand in}} the watershed of Darby Creek. The automobile replaced railroads as the dominant form of transportation, and it allowed workers to live farther from their places of employment. As a result, the population of Springfield Township more than doubled between 1950 and 1960. The Tinicum Wildlife Preserve was established in 1955 after the Gulf Oil Corporation donated a diked impoundment on the creek to the City of Philadelphia. Local resident Jean Diehl started a grassroots campaign to preserve the marsh in 1969, and Two Studies of Tinicum Marsh was published the following year which demonstrated the ecological importance of the marsh. The Folcroft Landfill and the Clearview Landfill operated along the creek between the 1950s and the 1970s before closing in the mid 1970s. The <b>former</b> <b>is</b> {{on the west bank}} of the creek and the latter is on the east bank. They supposedly accepted municipal waste, demolition waste, and medical waste. A number of businesses operated at the site of the Clearview Landfill after its closing.|$|E
5|$|AirSpace officially {{opened to}} the public on 12 July 2008. Over 30 {{aircraft}} are on display, dating back to the First World War; early aircraft include rare examples of an Airco DH.9 and a Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8. The <b>former</b> <b>is</b> one of only six surviving DH9s and the only example on display in the UK, and the latter is the only complete and original R.E.8 in existence. More recent notable aircraft include a Hawker Siddeley Harrier which served during the Falklands War with No. 1 Squadron RAF, and a Panavia Tornado, which flew the highest number of bomber sorties of any Tornado in the 1991 Gulf War. Also on display is a British Aircraft Corporation TSR-2 strike aircraft, one of only two survivors from the cancellation of the project in 1965. Recent additions include Eurofighter Typhoon DA4, one of seven Typhoon development aircraft, which was donated to the museum by the Ministry of Defence in 2008 and went on display in June 2009. Civil aircraft include the Duxford Aviation Society's Concorde and Comet described above.|$|E
