50|$|Subsequently the {{hospital}} buildings were demolished, {{leaving only the}} house Rhyndarra, stable and significant trees, prior to the property being subdivided into approximately 30 residential allotments. Rhyndarra was extensively refurbished, albeit on a greatly reduced block, {{and is now a}} family residence. The former stables is located on a separate allotment and became part of a new house, with the hay bale <b>hoist</b> <b>beam</b> on the upper floor still readily identifiable. Part of the riverfront of the original property is now a reserve for park purposes, under the trusteeship of the Brisbane City Council.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{a view of}} {{construction}} of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, showing a wooden track, ca. 1910 - 1920. A large, riveted pipe, supported by concrete blocks, runs from the left foreground to the hill that sits at the center background. A wooden track runs along the ground, parallel to the pipe. In {{the center of the}} image, two men lean on a cart that rests on the track. A metal apparatus with cables extending from the top, apparently used to <b>hoist</b> <b>beams,</b> sits {{to the right of the}} track. Hills are visible in the distance...|$|R
50|$|Water {{continued}} {{to be used to}} drive rural mills but mills, driven by steam, were built in towns alongside streams or canals to provide water for the engine. Murrays' Mills alongside the Rochdale Canal, in Ancoats were powered by 40 hp Boulton and Watt beam engines.b Some were built as room and power mills, which let space to entrepreneurs. The mills, often 'L' or U-shaped, were narrow and multi-storeyed. The engine house, warehousing and the office were inside the mill, although stair towers were external. Windows were square and smaller than in later mills. The walls were of unadorned rough brick. Construction was sometimes to fireproof designs. The mills are distinguished from warehouses in that warehouses had taking-in doors on each storey with an external <b>hoist</b> <b>beam.</b> Only the larger mills have survived.|$|R
25|$|The {{vertical}} flag for <b>hoisting</b> from a <b>beam</b> (German: Auslegerflagge or Galgenflagge; no. 3) is additionally {{attached to}} a horizontal beam, ensuring that it is fully displayed {{even if there is}} no wind.|$|R
50|$|The {{basement}} is a utilitarian space extending {{under the}} west wing of the Institute. It is accessed from a staircase below the main staircase in the entrance hall and from a vehicle ramp at the south west corner {{at the rear of}} the building. There is also an open well at the northwest corner of the building which gives access to ground and first floor from the basement. A goods <b>hoist</b> and <b>beam</b> are suspended below the first floor ceiling. A steep, steel industrial staircase and balustrade connects the three levels.|$|R
50|$|Another {{accident}} {{happened on}} 15 November 1897 during {{the reconstruction of}} nearby Treviddo Viaduct. On this occasion a rope gave way while five men were <b>hoisting</b> a wooden <b>beam</b> up onto the new viaduct. One of them {{let go of his}} rope too soon, this meant that the wood swung free and knocked two of the gang to their deaths.|$|R
25|$|Out of {{the extant}} barns in Stephenson County {{that have been}} listed on the National Register of Historic Places the Harbach Round Barn is the most altered from its {{original}} state. The two, interior loft plates have been replaced with steel <b>beams,</b> <b>hoisted</b> by steel jacks. The animal entrance, in the southeast quadrant of the barn, has also been sealed since the building is primarily used for storage.|$|R
50|$|A Class A viaduct 101 ft {{high and}} 486 ft long on 7 piers. It was {{replaced}} by a new stone viaduct on 14 September 1898. An accident happened on 15 November 1897 during this reconstruction work. A rope gave way while five men were <b>hoisting</b> a wooden <b>beam</b> up onto the new viaduct.

50|$|Construction of The Oval {{began in}} 1985, {{nearly four years}} after Calgary had been {{designated}} host of the XV Olympic Winter Games. Like the Olympic Saddledome most of the Oval's structure was built using precast, prestressed concrete. 28 beams were laid along {{the outside of the}} perimeter of the building to support 84 additional beams used to construct a lattice frame for the arched roof. The interior scaffolding used to <b>hoist</b> these 84 <b>beams</b> had to be lowered a centimetre at a time in a predetermined sequence in order to distribute the load of the roof equally to each of the 28 exterior support beams. Construction was completed {{by the end of the}} summer of 1987, officially opening in September 1987, five months before the beginning of the Olympics.|$|R
2500|$|On 7 February 1944, at 08:25, {{an escort}} {{off of the}} {{starboard}} <b>beam</b> <b>hoisted</b> the black pennant and dropped a depth charge. At 09:00, two British aircraft carriers and seven sloops as escorts rendezvoused with the convoy. At 12:55, an escort ahead indicated an underwater contact and, at 13:02, dropped five depth charges in quick succession. LST-21 went to General Quarters but the escort later gave up the search. At 13:23, an escort astern indicated contact but continued with the convoy after a brief delay. At 15;10 another escort on the starboard bow made a contact and ran alongside the starboard side of the convoy and, at 15:13 dropped one depth charge. Another escort joined the search, but {{a few minutes later}} they gave up the search and took station with the convoy. It was determined that they had run into a [...] "wolf pack".|$|R
50|$|Politicians George W. Bush, Kathleen Blanco, Ray Nagin and Bill Jefferson volunteered at the Musicians' Village on April 27, 2006. Put on tool {{belts and}} <b>hoisted</b> {{triangular}} roof <b>beam</b> sections up to workers scampering across the wooden skeletons of new houses. Then they went inside the framework, talked with individual volunteers, before Nagin and Bush climbed {{up and started}} hammering nails handed up to them by Blanco and Jefferson. Hootie & The Blowfish brought their entire band and crew down to New Orleans for 5 days of building houses, on October 16-20, 2006. Former president Jimmy Carter worked in December 2006. Barack Obama took part in painting a home, held discussions, received {{a tour of the}} area and was entertained with music by J.D. Hill. His Holiness Karekin II, Leader of the Armenian Apostolic Church, helped build a home on October 17, 2007, and senator John Edwards helped out on January 30, 2008. Edwards also held a ten-minute speech where he announced his withdrawal from the 2008 United States presidential race.|$|R
40|$|DE 19842298 A UPAB: 20000531 NOVELTY - The pallets (1) have axle pair support {{profiles}} to {{be lowered}} in the transfer box (2) to track surface level but then raised by the handler (3) for movement to a park storage box. The track surface in the transfer box (2) has indentations conforming to the pallet but to a height less than the pallet standing height, and the handler (3) has a vehicle transporter between transfer and parking boxes designed as a lift or <b>beam</b> <b>hoist</b> complete with flap-down box-facing end ramps. The transporter moves towards the parking boxes and can be rotated round its vertical axis. Below the track and to the sides, the transporter has chain load conveyors which can move in vehicle length sense relative the transporter track surface, and the transporter side facing the bearing system can be flapped down or swung away. Empty pallets can be taken off to a storage compartment arranged below the transporter level or in the transfer box. USE - Parking garages. ADVANTAGE - Pallets recessed for wheels maximize space utilization to give high volume parking capacity at lower cost without vehicle damage or parking confusion...|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} remove old {{monorail}} trains {{and replace them}} with new ones, they are shunted to maintenance shop beam [...] "D" [...] where each car segment is prepared individually for removal by supporting the remaining segment and disconnecting the bellows, cables and articulated motor truck. The car is then rolled outside along the beam to a position where a custom crane-hoist harness is fitted to it and the car is <b>hoisted</b> off the <b>beam</b> and transferred to a truck trailer on which a transport beam is bolted. The Diesel/hydraulic tractor (pictured) is used as a switcher to carefully tow each car {{into and out of the}} maintenance shop. The procedure is reversed for fitting new segments of monorail train cars to the beam while testing each system and connection. Each fully assembled train is then slowly and methodically tested thoroughly over many months before it can be placed into revenue service for guests. It was determined after delivery of Mark VII Monorail Red that platform clearance was too tight for the new, elongated end-compartments, so Monorail Blue was modified at the manufacturer and entered service before Red [...]|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} few decades great {{progression}} has been made in the research and development of a fairly new type of concrete called ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC). This high-tech material has excellent material properties compared to conventional concrete and has the potential to make more slender and lighter structures. However the material is still very expensive and requires designers to minimize material usage in order to make an economic structure. Up to today only few structures are built using UHPC, despite that it seems that the application of UHPC has plenty of potential. Especially in long span bridges it can be a very viable solution. Because the self-weight of the structure makes up {{a significant part of the}} total loading on the structure, the material saving ability of the material has a double effect. On the one hand the material saving reduces material costs, on the other hand the material saving causes a considerable reduction of the total loading on the structure. To fully benefit from these effects, the material use should be kept to a minimum. This can be achieved by finding a structural concept that utilizes the excellent material properties of UHPC as much as possible. UHPC has a very high compressive strength combined with excellent shear capacity. Besides that it is suitable for very high levels of prestress to resist tensile forces. A study using design calculations for rectangular cross-sections have shown that the application of UHPC instead of conventional concrete leads to a significant reduction of the required volume of concrete. This holds especially for shear elements and tensile elements with a high level of prestress. Since box beams has webs as shear elements and a bottom flange as a prestressed tensile member, UHPC box beams are chosen as the best solution for long span UHPC bridges. The application of UHPC can optimize the box-shaped cross-section in several ways. Very slender beams can be made by applying a high level of prestress. Also wider beams with very thin webs can be made thanks to the high shear capacity. For this master thesis five different types of UHPC box beams are developed. These optimized box beams are designed for bridges spanning 60 m, 70 m, 80 m, 85 m and 90 m. The most important advantages of these UHPC box beams over box beams made of conventional concrete are: • The beams are more slender: • The beams are wider: o Less beams have to be manufactured, transported and assembled, decreasing the amount of time and labor required to build the bridge. • The beams are lighter: o The total loading of the bridge is decreased by the lower self-weight. o They are easier to transport and to <b>hoist.</b> o Longer <b>beams</b> up to 90 m can be made without exceeding the 170 t weight-limit for transport by road. These benefits allow the UHPC box beams to be a fit solution for spans that are too long for conventional box beam solutions, without having to build an intermediate pier or to switch to segmented or cast in-situ solutions. Moreover they can replace old bridges with a stronger one without having to replace the substructure. Therefore it can be concluded that UHPC beams provide build new bridges and replace old bridges with minimal traffic hindrance.
