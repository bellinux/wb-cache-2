40|$|In horses early {{pregnancy}} loss between days 15 and 40 {{is a big}} problem. Equine pregnancy is characterized by an unusually long peri-implantation period. Implantation and placentation starts at 40 – 45 days after ovulation. During the peri-implantation period the conceptus is depending on uterine secretions for nutrient and gas exchange. Several researches show the great importance {{of the presence of}} osteopontin (OPN) within the uterus during the peri-implantation period to maintain successful pregnancy in sheep, pigs, rabbits and humans. The present research focuses on the expression and localization of OPN in the equine endometrium and conceptus during the peri-implantation period. The endometrial samples were obtained from non-pregnant uteri on Day 7, 14 or 21 (estrus) of the estrus cycle and from the pregnant uteri on Day 7, 14, 21 or 28 of gestation (n = 2 samples/day). The conceptus samples were obtained on Day 14, 21 or 28 of gestation (n = 2 samples/day). For the Day 14 and 21 concepti only the yolk sac was used for the present research; for Day 28 concepti both the yolk sac and the allantochorion was used. The endometrial and conceptus samples were stained by using immunohistochemistry and examined with light microscopy. The present results show that OPN is present in all glandular epithelium (GE) and luminal epithelium (LE) cells and in the glandular secretum during the estrus cycle and {{early pregnancy}}. In the pregnant equine uteri OPN increases during the gestation period from Day 21 and is maximum on Day 28. OPN is also present in the conceptus trophectoderm during the whole peri-implantation period. The most OPN is present in the allantochorion on Day 28 of gestation. On Day 21 the <b>embryonic</b> <b>capsule</b> disappears. These results suggest that possibly the disappearance of the <b>embryonic</b> <b>capsule</b> {{has something to do with}} the ability to increase the OPN expression. OPN is highly expressed in the peri-implantation period from Day 21 and therefore there is a good possibility that OPN involvement is important to successful maintenance of equine pregnancy...|$|R

40|$|Tendon {{injuries}} occur commonly in {{horses and}} their repair through scar tissue formation predisposes horses {{to a high}} rate of re-injury. Pluripotent stem cells may provide a cell replacement therapy to improve tendon tissue regeneration and lower the frequency of re-injury. We have previously demonstrated that <b>equine</b> <b>embryonic</b> stem cells (ESCs) differentiate into the tendon cell lineage upon injection into the damaged horse tendon and can differentiate into functional tendon cells in vitro to generate artificial tendons. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have now been derived from horses but, to date, there are no reports on their ability to differentiate into tendon cells. As iPSCs can be produced from adult cell types, they provide a more accessible source of cells than ESCs, which require the use of horse embryos. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare tendon differentiation by ESCs and iPSCs produced through two independent methods. In 2 -dimensional differentiation assays the iPSCs expressed tendon associated genes and proteins, which were enhanced by the presence of transforming growth factor-β 3. However, in 3 -dimensional differentiation assays the iPSCs failed to differentiate into functional tendon cells and generate artificial tendons. These results demonstrate the utility of the 3 -dimensional in vitro tendon assay for measuring tendon differentiation and the need for more detailed studies to be performed on equine iPSCs to identify and understand their epigenetic differences from pluripotent ESCs prior to their clinical application...|$|R
40|$|Cartilage and tendon {{injuries}} {{are a significant}} source of animal wastage and financial loss within the horse-racing industry. Moreover, both cartilage and tendon have limited intrinsic capacity for self-repair, and the functionally inferior tissue produced within a lesion may reduce performance and increase the risk of reinjury. Stem cells offer tremendous potential for accelerating and improving tissue healing, and adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are already used to treat cartilage and tendon injuries in horses. However, MSCs are scarce in the bone marrow isolates used, have limited potential for proliferation and differentiation in vitro, and do not appear to noticeably improve long-term functional repair. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells could overcome many of the limitations and be used to generate tissues of value for equine regenerative medicine. To date, six lines of putative ESCs have been described in the horse. All expressed stem cell–associated markers and exhibited longevity and pluripotency in vitro, but none have been proven to exhibit pluripotency in vivo. Moreover, it is becoming clear that the markers used to characterize the putative ESCs were inadequate, primarily because studies in domestic species have revealed that they are not specific to ESCs or the pluripotent inner cell mass, but also because the function of most in the maintenance of pluripotency is not known. Future derivation and validation of <b>equine</b> <b>embryonic</b> or other pluripotent stem cells would benefit greatly from a reliable panel of molecular markers specific to pluripotent cells of the developing horse embryo...|$|R
40|$|Induced {{pluripotent}} {{stem cells}} (iPSCs) are generated by reprogramming somatic cells to an embryonic state. Therefore iPSCs represent an extremely valuable tool for modelling disease and organ toxicity, with enormous potential in veterinary medicine. Several equine diseases are currently untreatable and can result in euthanasia on medical grounds. In contrast to humans, in vitro models for cellular research in equine do not exist. Therefore it has been necessary to explore the use of stem cells in constructing cell based equine models. Pluripotent stem cell populations are of great interest in this field given their ability to form the three germ layers found in the developing embryo. While a promising notion, the isolation of <b>equine</b> <b>embryonic</b> stem cells has thus far proved elusive and therefore it has been necessary to explore other pluripotent stem cell populations. A very limited number of induced PSC lines have so far been generated from equine fibroblasts but studies in humans showed that other cell types such as keratinocytes were more amenable to reprogramming and generated iPSCs with much higher efficiency; whether this may be also the case in other species has not been investigated. Moreover, iPSC lines reported so far from domestic species, including the horse, depended on complex culture conditions for growth, including feeder layers and media supplementation with several growth factors. Although a promising alternative to fibroblast for generation of induced {{pluripotent stem cells}} there is dearth in literature on equine keratinocyte culture techniques. In this work I am reporting a novel approach to generate equine iPSCs lines from keratinocytes. Skin biopsies were used to derive keratinocyte cultures. The three dimensional culture systems were developed for robust culture of equine keratinocytes. These cells were then transduced with retroviral constructs coding for murine Oct- 4, Sox- 2, c-Myc and Klf- 4 sequences, following the original Yamanaka protocol. Following transduction, tight cell colonies with sharp boundaries staining positive for alkaline phosphatase resembling previously reported human iPSCs were generated. The reprogrammed cells were successfully maintained in feeder free and serum free conditions with LIF supplementation. Immunochemistry and qPCR analyses revealed the equine iPSCs lines expressed pluripotency markers expressed in <b>equine</b> <b>embryonic</b> stages including, OCT 4, SOX 2, SSEA 1, LIN 28, NANOG, REX 1 and DNMT 3 B. Equine iPSCs were able to form embryoid bodies and differentiate into derivatives of the three germ layers in vitro. Equine iPSCs were pluripotent in vivo as demonstrated by the formation of teratoma consisting of tissue derivatives of all three lineages such as bone, cartilage, pulmonary epithelium and mature neurons in SCID mice. Importantly, equine iPSCs should not only have the ability to differentiate in a non-directed manner. Therefore, the ability for efficient and directed cellular differentiation was analysed. Equine iPSCs were successfully induced to differentiate into neurospheres forming extensive neuronal projections and synapses. Equine iPSCs were differentiated to neurons using a novel and robust approach. The neurons expressed FOXG 1, TUBB 3 at induction before ISL 1 up regulation, a potent and specific inducer of motor neurons, during terminal differentiation. The neurons tested could fire multiple action potentials and also induce TTX –sensitive action potentials. The iPSC line that showed in vivo differentiation in bone and cartilage was tested for directed differentiation into bone and results were compared to equine mesenchymal stem cells. This study provides the first demonstration of the potential of iPSCs in equine biomedicine. The ability to derive iPSC cells capable of direct differentiation in vitro opens the way for new and exciting applications in equine regenerative medicine...|$|R
40|$|Large {{quantities}} {{of an unusual}} 19 kDa protein (p 19) are secreted into the lumen of the uterus of the mare (Equus caballus) during the oestrous cycle and early pregnancy. p 19 associates strongly with the acellular capsule that surrounds the young horse conceptus and {{is believed to be}} important in maintaining pregnancy. Here we report the complete cDNA sequence encoding p 19, its expression patterns in horse tissues and a Southern blot analysis of the gene in horse DNA. The predicted amino acid sequence of the p 19 cDNA demonstrated a signal peptide of 18 residues and a mature protein of 162 residues, giving a predicted molecular mass of 18. 8 kDa for the secreted protein. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence showed that p 19 belongs to the lipocalin family of proteins, which are classified on the basis of three conserved amino acid sequence motifs and an eight-stranded anti-parallel beta-barrel conformation. Overall, p 19 was most similar to the mouse major urinary protein (MUP) lipocalins (30 - 34 % identity). Secondary structural predictions and structural modelling using the MUP 1 crystal structure coordinates gave convincing evidence that the three-dimensional structure of p 19 closely resembles that of the lipocalins. However, p 19 has several unusual substitutions in one of the three conserved lipocalin motifs and therefore seems to be a novel member of the family. Lipocalins perform many different functions but most bind small hydrophobic molecules and the majority act as transport proteins. The function of p 19 might therefore be as a carrier of a maternal factor needed to sustain the developing embryo during pregnancy, or it could be incorporated into the <b>embryonic</b> <b>capsule</b> and perform some other function. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that expression of p 19 is confined to the endometrial lining of the mare's uterus, and hybridization studies in situ showed that the mRNA for p 19 is localized to the glandular and luminal epithelia of the endometrium. A Southern blot analysis of horse DNA indicated a single gene for p 19 that seems to be at least 4. 5 kb in size...|$|R

Embryos, Days 6. 5 to 7. 5, were assigned to a 3 (stage) × 2 (media) factorial design (n = 3 per group) based on diameter and developmental stage [(1) morulae + very early blastocysts; (2) blastocysts 300 μm] and base media [(1) PBS supplemented with 0. 3 mM pyruvate, 3. 3 mM glucose and 10 % FCS or (2) HCDM (Olson SE and Seidel GE Jr. 2000 J. Anim. Sci. 78, 152 – 157) with Eagle’s essential and nonessential amino acids, 2 mM glucose, 3 mg mL- 1 BSA and 20 % FCS]. Embryos were placed sequentially in 200 μL of 1. 4 M glycerol for 5 min, 200 μL of 1. 4 M glycerol + 3. 6 M ethylene glycol for 5 min, and 30 μL of 3. 4 M glycerol + 4. 6 M ethylene glycol. Within 30 s, the 30 -μL drop containing the embryo was loaded into the center of a 0. 25 -mL straw separated by air from columns (30 μL) of the same solution. Straw ends were loaded with columns (60 μL) of 0. 5 M galactose in base medium. The straw was heat-sealed and exposed to liquid-nitrogen vapor for 1 min before being plunged into liquid nitrogen. To warm embryos, straws were held in air for 10 s and then immersed in 20 °C water for 10 s. Embryos were transferred into 200 μL of 0. 25 M galactose solution for 5 min, and then placed in PBS or HCDM. Within 10 min, embryos (n = 3 per recipient), grouped for stage and media, were transferred nonsurgically into the uteri of 6 recipients that had ovulated 6 days earlier.

A combination of imaging and algal 18 S rDNA amplification reveals algal invasion of embryonic salamander tissues and cells during development. Algal cells are detectable from embryonic and larval Stages 26 – 44 through chlorophyll autofluorescence and algal 18 S rDNA amplification. Algal cell ultrastructure indicates both degradation and putative encystment {{during the process of}} tissue and cellular invasion.

One to two months prior to the birth of their foals, blood for serology was collected from the mares. The same specimens were collected from the foals just after birth, prior to suckling and a day after suckling. Thereafter the foals were examined monthly for the presence of respiratory disease and specimens taken. The following specimens were collected from each foal: three nasopharyngeal swabs, (one for virus isolation, one for bacteria and fungus isolation, and one for mycoplasma isolation) and blood that was allowed to clot. Blood was collected in heparin from sick foals with elevated rectal temperatures. Virus isolation was done on roller tube cultures of <b>equine</b> <b>embryonic</b> lung (EEL), Vero cells and rabbit kidney 13 (RK 13) cells. The bacteria (including mycoplasmas) and fungi were cultured from the swabs and identified using a variety of traditional methods. The serum neutralization test (SNT) was used to detect antibodies to equid herpesvirus 1 (EHV- 1), equid herpesvirus 4 (EHV- 4), equine rhinovirus 1 (ERV- 1), equine rhinovirus 2 (ERV- 2) and equine adenovirus 1 (EAdV- 1). The complement fixation test (CFT) was used to detect antibodies to EHV- 1 and EHV- 4 and the haemagglutination inhibition test (HIT) antibodies to equine influenzavirus (EIV). Only EHV- 4 was cultured from the nasopharyngeal swabs of nine foals when they were 5 to 6 months of age and from one foal two months later. A wide variety of bacteria and fungi were cultured and it was established that coagulase-negative staphylococci, viridans streptococci, Moraxella spp. and Flavobacterium spp. predominated in most of the samples. Several potential bacterial pathogens were isolated but the most common were Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus, Actinobacillus equuland Staphylococcus aureus. Colostrum-derived antibodies were detected for all the viruses in all but two of the foals. It was found that the foals had similar or slightly higher titres than their mothers. The levels declined in direct proportion to what they initially were and were depleted by the time the foals were 2 to 7 months of age. Antibodies to natural infection was detected to EHV- 4, ERV- 2 and EAdV- 1. A rise in antibody titres occurred when the foals were 5 to 6 months of age, two months later and when they were one year of age. Antibodies resulting from immunization was detected to EHV- 1, EHV- 4 and EIV. It was established that the most important virus causing upper respiratory tract disease of the foals from 5 to 12 months of age was EHV- 1 with EAdV- 1 playing a minor role. These viruses caused repeated bouts of infection with a two to five months interval. Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus was considered {{to be the most important}} secondary pathogen. Prior to this period most of the foals were healthy with only a few suffering from upper respiratory disease. The aetiology was not determined in these cases, but based on the bacteriology results, it was suspected that some of them were suffering from bacterial infections.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Equine {{breeding}} industries {{suffer from}} many inefficiencies arising from deficits {{in our understanding}} of reproductive physiology in this species. This includes cases of idiopathic infertility and suboptimal resistance of spermatozoa to chilled storage and cryopreservation in stallions, and high rates of early embryo loss in mares. At the same time, unchecked breeding in populations of feral horses, an introduced species in the Australian landscape, contributes to damage of sensitive ecosystems and poses an ethical conundrum in light of controversy surrounding lethal population control methods. Existing fertility control agents are lacking in their efficacy and specificity. Improving our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying reproductive function in horses is paramount if we are to achieve better outcomes in breeding industries and develop novel contraceptive strategies for feral horses. The advent of highly sensitive mass spectrometry technologies provides a distinct opportunity to characterize the proteomic profiles of the major phenotypic elements of equine reproduction – the spermatozoon and the early embryo. This thesis encompasses a series of studies whose aims were 1) to utilize cutting edge mass spectrometry technology to characterize the proteomes of stallion spermatozoa and of early equine embryos together with their secretome and immediate uterine environment, 2) to integrate proteomic data with bioinformatics and in vitro experimentation and thus elicit an improved understanding of equine reproductive function and 3) to deliver applied outcomes in fertility manipulation (including contraceptive targets and strategies for improving fertility). Mass spectrometry driven proteomic analysis of equine spermatozoa revealed 1030 proteins. Together with gene ontology analyses these provided new information about the metabolism, antioxidant defenses and receptors of stallion spermatozoa. Mitochondrial proteins and those involved in catabolic processes constituted dominant categories. Several enzymes specific to beta-oxidation of fatty acids were identified, and further in vitro experiments demonstrated that beta-oxidation contributes to metabolism and motility in stallion spermatozoa. Identification of a series of receptors, kinases and metabolic enzymes in the sperm proteome led to an investigation of the roles of peroxisome proliferator activating receptor gamma (PPARG) and the metabolic switch, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), in regulation of stallion sperm metabolism and in mediating the remarkable effects of an anti-diabetic pharmaceutical, rosiglitazone, on sperm motility, reactive oxygen species production, mitochondrial function and ATP production. The characterization of functional AMPK in stallion spermatozoa provided a novel avenue for the manipulation of sperm metabolism and improvement of sperm storage methods. Accordingly, rosiglitazone substantially alleviated the time-dependent deterioration of stallion spermatozoa during ambient temperature storage by diverting metabolism away from oxidative phosphorylation and towards glycolysis, with novel implications for preservation of stallion spermatozoa. In the final study, we present the first successful proteomic analysis of several components of the equine pregnancy: proteins secreted by early embryos, blastocoel fluid composition, the <b>embryonic</b> <b>capsule,</b> and uterine luminal fluid proteins. Integrating these findings with existing literature yields novel insights into how these proteins fit into the complex puzzle of pregnancy establishment and maintenance. The studies presented herewith demonstrate the successful utilization of cutting edge mass spectrometric technology for comprehensive analysis of the proteins that define the male gamete in the stallion and early pregnancy in the mare, with implications for both equine fertility control and fertility enhancement...|$|R

There is often different sculpture or ornamentation on prodissoconch I compared with prodissoconch II, and this can be distinguished under the microscope. [...] The prodissoconch I valves of the larval bivalve mollusc are thin, smooth and translucent, and generally appear during the first 24 hours of life. Smooth valves continue to grow symmetrically and a gently sloping umbo projects {{from the middle of the}} hinge line. The prodissoconch II valves are secreted onto the prodissoconch I valves by the edge of the mantle and are still smooth but have faint microsculpture. Following metamorphosis the bivalve larvae (known as a veliger) develop a foot and the velum (or cilia) is reabsorbed and lost. After metamorphosis there is a distinct line where the prodissoconch II stage ends and the part of the valves known as the dissoconch begins and the bivalve mollusk begins its adult sessile existence. [...] During metamorphosis, the veliger, depending on species, may secrete an attachment structure called a byssus that anchors it to the substratum. Some species spend considerable time searching for an ideal habitat before metamorphosing, but others may settle on the nearest suitable substrate.|$|R
40|$|Infections with nidoviruses {{can cause}} various {{problems}} in animals and human beings. Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) {{has been considered}} as an important pathogen, causing severe diarrhea of newborn calves, winter dysentery of adult cattle, and respiratory disease in calves. Since this virus is repeatedly reported to cause severe disease in the Swedish cattle population, {{it is important to}} develop a highly sensitive diagnostic method for the detection of BCoV and to study the genetic characteristics of virus involved in the outbreaks. A nested RT-PCR method targeting the HE gene was developed, which can be successfully applied for the diagnosis of BCoV infection. A conventional PCR was used to amplify the S gene of BCoV. Sequence analysis of the S gene showed a genetic diversity among Swedish and Danish virus isolates. S gene sequencing did not reveal differences between viruses from nasal and fecal swabs originating from the same animal, suggesting that the same virus can cause respiratory and enteric disease. Horses are infected with equine arteritis virus (EAV) primarily through the respiratory and venereal routes. The outcome can vary greatly from subclinical infection to systemic disease characterised by fever, nasal discharge, lacrimation, arteritis, abortion, fetal death, and persistent infection in stallions. The LP 3 A 1 + strain, a virus stock that was obtained by one additional cell culture passage of the LP 3 A virus, a large plaque variant of EAV Bucyrus strain, in <b>equine</b> <b>embryonic</b> cells was shown to be more virulent than the LP 3 A virus. An experimental infection has been done with a group of 14 horses to further characterise the in vivo biology of this LP 3 A 1 + virus. Analysis of open reading frames (ORFs) encoding EAV glycoproteins (GP) has shown the occurrence of mutations {{in the course of the}} experimental infection. While ORFs 2 b and 3 had stabilizing mutations, ORFs 4 and 5 were subject to positive selection. Mutations in ORF 5 mainly clustered in variable region 1, resulting in new genetic variants with changed neutralization domain in the GP 5 (previously termed GL). The new virus variants, however could not be entirely related to induction of recurrent viraemia in the infected horses, which is presumed to have been caused by other factors. It would be of interest to investigate the occurrence of other forms of persistent infection, rather than carrier stallions, upon infection with EAV. Samples originating from a group of 14 horses experimentally infected with a variant of equine arteritis virus (EAV) Bucyrus strain, termed large plaque variant (LP 3 A 1 +) were analysed. These included 182 nasal swabs collected from day 1 to day 14 post-infection (p. i), and 21 virus isolates obtained from white blood cells of horses that showed a secondary viraemia between day 30 and day 72 p. i. In order to understand the reason for this virus behaviour, genetic stability of the virus was studied by comparison of partial open reading frame 5 (ORF 5), specifying glycoprotein 5 (GP 5). Viruses with amino acid mutations in GP 5 were used for further amplification and sequencing of a fragment encompassing ORFs 2 b, 3, and 4. The sequences of the virus obtained from nasal swabs shared complete homology with the inoculated virus showing that the ORF 5 gene of LP 3 A 1 + was genetically stable during the first two weeks p. i. However, a number of mutations were found in the ORF 5 of virus isolates obtained from day 30 p. i. when compared to the original inoculated virus. These mutations mainly clustered in antigenic neutralization site C within variable region 1 of the GP 5 ectodomain. ORFs 2 b and 3 had mostly silent substitutions and were more stable, whereas ORF 4 showed non-conservative substitutions. Our results show that ORFs 4 and 5 of the inoculated LP 3 A 1 + virus were subject to positive selection, most likely driven by immunological pressure, during the course of infection. However, genetic variation did not appear to be the underlying reason for the onset of a second wave of viraemia. It is plausible that the virus had been “trapped” at immune privilege sites, following initial infection, and was triggered to replicate by an unknown stimulus, therefore causing reappearance of viraemia...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesRecent {{radiological}} {{studies have}} demonstrated that formation of the sphenoid sinus is preceded by a phase of fatty transformation of the bone marrow, and then by a phase of fat involution prior to the appearance of an aerated cavity and that this process can sometimes be interrupted, resulting in the persistence of images of arrested pneumatisation. The objective {{of the study was to}} confirm the existence of arrested pneumatisation in the sphenoid bone, and to investigate the presence of similar images in the maxilla, frontal and ethmoid bones. Material and methodsIn this single-centre, retrospective study, 207 CT scans with no signs of mucosal opacity or sinus retention performed for assessment of septorhinoplasty or chronic nasal dysfunction were reviewed according to Welker's criteria to detect images of arrested pneumatisation. ResultsTwenty-two patients presented 30 images suggestive of arrested pneumatisation of the maxilla (13 / 30), sphenoid (10 / 30) and frontal (7 / 30) bones. No images of arrested pneumatisation were observed in the ethmoid bone. ConclusionsThe results of this study question the classical mechanisms of formation of the paranasal sinuses. According to the hypothesis of postnatal bone cavitation resulting from bone marrow involution and centripetal gas production, paranasal sinuses would constitute distinct organs that develop independently of the ethmoidal olfactory organ, which is formed from the <b>embryonic</b> cartilaginous olfactory <b>capsule...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{embryonic}} {{development of}} the squid Loligo vulgaris was observed from 183 egg masses collected from special devices deployed throughout Cabrera National Park (Baleares Islands, western Mediterranean Sea). Sequence alignment analysis of the cytochrome oxidase I gene revealed that all embryos belonged to L.  vulgaris. In total, 549 egg capsules were examined. Viable egg capsules (n =  420) were classified into one of five maturation stages according to the primary external features. The length of the viable egg capsules varied between 40 and 170  mm, and increased with embryonic development. The non-viable capsules (n =  129) were categorized into four groups: I (Ginger root), non-viable II and III, and empty egg capsule (IV). The percentage of non-viable capsules (i. e. grades I, II and III) was 92. 25 %. Empty capsules accounted for 7. 75 % of the total non-viable egg <b>capsules.</b> <b>Embryonic</b> development was classified into a second scale of eight stages. Egg <b>capsule</b> stage and <b>embryonic</b> stage were significantly related (n =  420; p <  0. 001), facilitating {{the determination of the}} embryo developmental phase based on the outward appearance of the egg capsules. The embryo development stage based on the external features of the egg capsules might constitute an innovative tool for in situ embryological data collection. This new method is neither time consuming nor invasive, and could be helpful in fishing cruises, for scuba diving visual census in natural habitats and for laboratory culture. Slight variability in the developmental embryonic stages within egg capsules from the same egg mass was identified. The origin of this asynchrony is discussed. Chronological appearance of organs was {{similar to that of the}} six loliginid species previously examined. However, some developmental changes in the timing or rate of events (heterochronies) were observed: Hoyle’s organ was formed earlier in L.  vulgaris and the appearance of ventral chromatophores was slightly delayed (2  days) compared with the other species considered.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} {{aspects of the}} biology of the cestode, Proteocephalus filicollis from the three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus from Airthrey Loch, Scotland. The population biology study demonstrated that the parasite has an annual cycle of recruitment, which occur mostly in late summer and early autumn. The cestode did not show preference for any sex of the host. Maturation of the cestode also showed a seasonal cycle {{with the majority of}} worms maturing in late spring and early summer, but this period may be extended in different generations. Proteocephalus filicollis was overdispersed throughout the year in all sizes of fish, moreover variance to mean ratio always exceeded unity. No severe pathology was observed due to attachment of the worm to the intestine of the fish. The worm population in different sections of the intestine varied according to season and maturity stage. The P. filicollis migrate from the rectum to the anterior intestine as they mature and it is suggested that growth and maturation of the worm is a major stimulus for this migration. Proteocephalus filicollis has a high fecundity as indicated by the higher number of eggs per mm of gravid portion of the strobila and high fertility. Infrapopulation size did not show any relationship with length of worm, percentage gravid portion, number of gravid segments or mean length of gravid segments. Numbers of eggs are correlated to length of the worm, but not to infrapopulation size. Numbers of eggs per mm of the gravid portion are not correlated to length of worm or infrapopulation size. Acanthocyclops robustus was used as an experimental intermediate host. 15 - 16 °C was the optimum experimental temperature for growth and a fully developed larva was formed in 23 - 27 days at this temperature. No growth was observed at 4 °C, growth was slow at 10 °C, but rapid at 21 - 22 °C. The eggs are infective for 25 days at 4 °C, 10 °C and 15 - 16 °C, but for only 15 days at 21 - 22 °C. Prevalence and mortality of copepods are significantly correlated to their exposure time to parasite eggs, but mean intensity of infection did not show any relationship to the exposure time to the eggs. Ultrastructural studies demonstrated that a mature egg is surrounded by at least four <b>embryonic</b> envelopes, the <b>capsule,</b> the outer envelope, the inner envelope, and the oncospheral membrane. All these envelopes originate differently and undergo definite changes during their development...|$|R
