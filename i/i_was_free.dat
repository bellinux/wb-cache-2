500|$|After {{reaching}} Philadelphia, Tubman {{thought of}} her family. [...] "I was a stranger in a strange land," [...] she said later. [...] "y father, my mother, my brothers, and sisters, and friends were [...] But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>free,</b> {{and they should be}} free." [...] She worked odd jobs and saved money. The U.S. Congress meanwhile passed the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, which heavily punished abetting escape and forced law enforcement officials—even in states that had outlawed slavery—to assist in their capture. The law increased risks for escaped slaves, more of whom therefore sought refuge in Southern Ontario (then part of the United Province of Canada), which, as part of the British Empire, had abolished slavery. Racial tensions were also increasing in Philadelphia as waves of poor Irish immigrants competed with free blacks for work.|$|E
500|$|Although he was {{permitted}} by XL to remix I'm New Here, Jamie xx wrote longhand letters to Scott-Heron for his approval {{to rework the}} other vocal material: [...] "Originally, I sent him the album {{and there were a}} couple of tracks he wasn't sure about. I had to write to him—he does handwritten letters, not e-mail—and explain why I wanted to use some of his older vocal tracks on the album ... So after I wrote him the letter, he said <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>free</b> to do whatever because he knew what I was doing". Scott-Heron was credited as a producer for the album, along with Russell and Malcolm Cecil, a producer and engineer on Scott-Heron's past work. The original vocals had been produced and engineered at Clinton Studios and Looking Glass Studios in New York. We're New Here was mixed at London's XL Studio, where additional recording also took place.|$|E

2500|$|While Smith {{still held}} to typical white South African {{views of the}} time, the seeds for his later change of {{position}} were planted in the 1960s and '70s. [...] Smith credited Swiss theologian Karl Barth for helping him eventually decide to fight apartheid. [...] In 1963, Barth {{asked him if he}} was really free to preach the Gospel in South Africa. [...] Barth asked him the question three times, concluding with [...] "Will you be free to preach the Gospel even if the government in your country tells you that you are preaching against the whole system?" [...] Smith found that [...] "I could not really answer the question truthfully. I thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>free,</b> and yet I was not sure." [...] Smith later said that he realized he [...] "would have to decide to teach my theology but not apply it, or apply it and take the consequences." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reflecting on {{his first}} six novels and his rapid writing {{turnover}} later in his career, DeLillo remarked, [...] "I wasn't learning {{to slow down and}} examine what I was doing more closely. I don't have regrets about that work, but I do think that if I had been a bit less hasty in starting each new book, I might have produced somewhat better work in the 1970s. My first novel took so long and was such an effort that once <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>free</b> of it I almost became carefree in a sense and moved right through the decade, stopping, in a way, only at Ratner's Star (1976), which was an enormous challenge for me, and probably a bigger challenge for the reader. But I slowed down in the 1980s and '90s." [...] DeLillo has also acknowledged some of the weaknesses of his 1970s works, reflecting in 2007: [...] "I knew I wasn’t doing utterly serious work, let me put it that way." ...|$|E
