40|$|Abstract Background Sliding DNA clamps are processivity {{factors that}} are {{required}} for efficient DNA replication. DNA polymerases maintain proximity to nucleic acid templates by interacting with sliding clamps that encircle DNA and thereby link the polymerase enzyme to the DNA substrate. Although the structures of sliding clamps from Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli), eukaryotes, archaea, and T 4 -like bacteriophages are well-known, {{the structure of a}} sliding clamp from Gram-positive bacteria has not been reported previously. Results We have determined the crystal structure of the dimeric β subunit of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme of Streptococcus pyogenes. The sliding clamp from this Gram-positive organism forms a ring-shaped dimeric assembly that is similar in overall structure to that of the sliding clamps from Gram-negative bacteria, bacteriophage T 4, eukaryotes and archaea. The dimer has overall dimensions of ~ 90 Å × ~ 70 Å × ~ 25 Å with a central chamber that is large enough to accommodate duplex DNA. In comparison to the circular shape of other assemblies, the <b>S.</b> pyogenes <b>clamp</b> adopts a more elliptical structure. Conclusion The sequences of sliding <b>clamps</b> from <b>S.</b> pyogenes and E. coli are only 23 % identical, making the generation of structural models for the <b>S.</b> pyogenes <b>clamp</b> difficult in the absence of direct experimental information. Our structure of the S. pyogenes β subunit completes the catalog of clamp structures from all the major sequence grouping of sliding clamps. The more elliptical rather than circular structure of the <b>S.</b> pyogenes <b>clamp</b> implies that the topological nature of encircling DNA, rather than a precise geometric shape, is the most conserved aspect for this family of proteins. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive comparison study between the discrete singular convolution (DSC) and the well-known global method of generalized differential quadrature (GDQ) for vibration analysis {{so as to}} enhance {{the understanding of the}} DSC algorithm. The DSC method is implemented through Lagrange 2 ̆ 7 s delta sequence kernel (DSC-LK), which utilizes local Lagrange polynomials to calculate weighting coefficients, whereas, the GDQ requires global ones. Moreover, it is shown that the treatments of boundary conditions and the use of grid systems are different in the two methods. Comparison study is carried out on 21 rectangular plates of different combinations of simply supported (<b>S),</b> <b>clamped</b> (C) and transversely supported with nonuniform elastic rotational restraint (E) edges, and five rectangular plates of mixed supporting edges, some of which with a range of aspect ratios and rotational spring coefficients. All the results of the DSC-LK agree very well with both those in the literature and newly computed GDQ results. Furthermore, it is observed that the DSC-LK performs much better for plates vibrating at higher-order eigenfrequencies. Unlike the GDQ, the DSC-LK is numerically stable for problems which require a large number of grid points...|$|R

This research was conducted by analyzing the quality product injection molding of the rearview mirror case product of PS 135. The analysis with simulation used the software of Autodesk Inventor 2013. The work parameter of the injection molding included the mold temperature of 50 °C, the maximum machine injection pressure of 85 MPa, the injection time of 2 <b>s,</b> and the <b>clamp</b> open machine time of 7 s, with the variations of melt temperature of 200 °C, 210 °C, 220 °C, 230 °C, 240 °C, 250 °C, 260 °C, 270 °C, 280 °C, and 290 °C. The variations of melt temperature were executed by using the injection molding machine of Haitian HTF 160 X. The data of the research were analyzed by using the descriptive technique of analysis. The result of the {{research shows that the}} melt temperature parameter influence the total part weight, quality prediction, shrinkage defect, and sink mark defect of the rearview mirror case product of PS 135. The increase in the melt temperature causes the decrease in the total part weight.

40|$|SummaryThe {{mismatch}} repair (MMR) initiation protein MutS forms {{at least two}} types of sliding clamps on DNA: a transient mismatch searching <b>clamp</b> (∼ 1 <b>s)</b> and an unusually stable (∼ 600 <b>s)</b> ATP-bound <b>clamp</b> that recruits downstream MMR components. Remarkably, direct visualization of single MutS particles on mismatched DNA has not been reported. We have combined real-time particle tracking with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to image MutS diffusion dynamics on DNA containing a single mismatch. We show searching MutS rotates during diffusion independent of ionic strength or flow rate, suggesting continuous contact with the DNA backbone. In contrast, ATP-bound MutS clamps that are visually and successively released from the mismatch spin freely around the DNA, and their diffusion is affected by ionic strength and flow rate. These observations show that ATP binding alters the MutS diffusion mechanics on DNA, which {{has a number of}} implications for the mechanism of MMR...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare iron {{stores in}} infants born after {{elective}} caesarean section (CS) and a 30  s delay of umbilical cord clamping with those born vaginally after early (≤ 10  s) or delayed (≥ 180  <b>s)</b> cord <b>clamping.</b> DESIGN: Prospective observational study with historical control. SETTING: Swedish county hospital. POPULATION: 64 infants born after elective CS {{were compared with}} a historical control of 166 early clamped and 168 delayed clamped after vaginal birth. METHODS: Blood and iron status were measured in blood samples collected at birth, 48 - 96  hours after birth, 4 and 12  months of age. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Ferritin at 4  months of age was the primary outcome, second outcome measures were other indicators of iron status, and haemoglobin, at 4 and 12  months of age, as well as respiratory distress at 1 and 6  hours after birth. RESULTS: At 4  months infants born by elective CS had better iron status than those born vaginally subjected to early cord clamping, shown by higher adjusted mean difference of ferritin concentration (39  µg/L (95 % CI 10 to 60)) and mean cell volume (1. 8  fL (95 % CI 0. 6 to 3. 0)); {{and lower levels of}} transferrin receptors (- 0. 39  mg/L (95 % CI - 0. 69 to - 0. 08)). No differences were seen between infants born after elective CS and delayed clamped vaginally born infants at 4  months. No differences were found between groups at 12  months of age. CONCLUSIONS: Waiting to clamp the umbilical cord for 30  s after elective CS results in higher iron stores at 4  months of age compared with early cord clamping after vaginal birth, and seems to ensure iron status comparable with those achieved after 180  <b>s</b> delayed cord <b>clamping</b> after vaginal birth...|$|R
40|$|The two-microelectrode, voltage-clamp {{technique}} {{was applied to}} rabbit cardiac Purkinje fibers to study the interaction of tetrodotoxin (TTX) with the slowly inactivating Na current. Binding of TTX to rested, inactivated, and activated channels was estimated by measuring the relative decrease of current at the beginning (rested and inactivated channels) and the end (activated channels) of a 1 <b>s</b> depolarizing <b>clamp</b> to - 45 mV. The accelerated decline of the Na current {{in the presence of}} a submaximal dose of TTX was interpreted as an increase in blocking efficiency upon depolarization. The experiments show that activated as well as inactivated channels are more sensitive to TTX than are rested channels. The dissociation equilibrium constants for the three states are 3. 5 X 10 (- 6) M for the rested, 0. 94 X 10 (- 6) M for the activated, and 0. 75 X 10 (- 6) M for the inactivated channels.

40|$|ABSTRACT A spike that is {{the result}} of calcium {{permeability}} through potassium channels was separated from the action potential in squid giant axons internally perfused with a 30 mM NaF solution and bathed in a 100 mM CaCl 2 solution by blocking sodium channels with tetrodotoxin. Currents through potassium channels were studied under voltage clamp. The records showed a clear voltage-dependent inactivation of the currents. The inactivation was composed of at least two components; one relatively fast, having a time constant of 20 - 30 ms, and the other very slow, having a time constant of 5 - 10 <b>s.</b> Voltage <b>clamp</b> was carried out with a variety of salt compositions in both the internal and external solutions. A similar voltage-dependent inactivation, also composed of the two components, was recognized in all the currents through potassium channels. Although the direction and intensity of current strongly depended on the salt composition of the solutions, the time-courses of these currents at corresponding voltages were very similar. These results strongly suggest that the inactivation of the currents is attributable to an essential, dynamic property of potassium channels themselves. Thus, the generation of a potassium-channel spike can be understood as an event that occurs when the equilibrium potential across the potassium channel becomes positive...|$|R

40|$|Sliding clamps play central {{roles in}} {{a broad range of}} DNA {{replication}} and repair processes. The clamps form circular molecules that must be opened and resealed around DNA by the clamp loader complex to fulfil their function. While most eukaryotes and many archea possess a homo-trimeric PCNA, the PCNA of Sulfolobus solfataricus is a heterotrimer. Here, we exploit the asymmetry of S. solfataricus PCNA to create a series of circularly permuted PCNA subunit fusions, thereby covalently closing defined interfaces within the heterotrimer. Using these concatamers, we investigate the requirements for loading the clamp onto DNA and reveal that a single defined interface within the heterotrimer is opened during the loading process.

Previous studies found that “clasping” the αIIb head domain to the β 3 tail decreased fibrinogen binding. To study the role of αIIb extension about the genu, we introduced a disulfide “clamp” between the αIIb thigh and calf- 1 domains. Clamped αIIbβ 3 had markedly reduced ability to bind the large soluble ligands fibrinogen and PAC- 1 when activated with monoclonal antibody (mAb) PT 25 - 2 but not when activated by Mn 2 + or by coexpressing the clamped αIIb with a β 3 subunit containing the activating mutation N 339 <b>S.</b> The <b>clamp</b> {{had little effect on}} the binding of the snake venom kistrin (Mr 7, 500) or αIIbβ 3 -mediated adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen, but it did diminish the enhanced binding of mAb AP 5 in the presence of kistrin. Collectively, our studies support a role for αIIb extension about the genu in the binding of ligands of 340, 000 and 900, 000 Mr with mAb-induced activation but indicate that it is not an absolute requirement. Our data are consistent with αIIb extension resulting in increased access to the ligand-binding site and/or facilitating the conformational change(s) in β 3 that affect the intrinsic affinity of the binding pocket for ligand...|$|R
40|$|Using {{the root}} {{pressure}} probe in the pressure clamping (PC) mode, {{the impact of}} internal unstirred layers (USLs) was quantified for young corn roots, both in experiments and in computer simulations applying the convection/diffusion model of Knipfer et al. In the experiments, water flows (JVrs) during PC were analysed in great detail, showing that JVrs (and the apparent root hydraulic conductivity) were high during early stages of PC and declined rapidly during the first 80 <b>s</b> of <b>clamping</b> to a steady-state value of 40 – 30 % of the original. The comparison of experimental results with simulations showed that, during PC, internal USLs at the inner surface of the endodermis substantially modify the overall force driving the water. As a consequence, JVr and Lpr were inhibited. Effects of internal USLs were minimized when using the pressure relaxation mode, when internal USLs had not yet developed. Additional stop-clamp experiments and experiments where the endodermis was punctured to reduce the effect of internal USLs verified the existence of internal USLs during PC. Data indicated {{that the role of}} pressure propagation along the root xylem for both PC and pressure relaxation modes should be small, as should the effects of filling of the capacities during root pressure probe experiments, which are discussed as an alternative model. The results supported the idea that concentration polarization effects at the endodermis (internal USLs) cause a serious problem whenever relatively large amounts of water (xylem sap) are radially moved across the root, such as during PC or when using the high-pressure flow meter technique...|$|R

The [Ni(phen) 3] 2 + cation is regular, with an almost ideal NiII bond-valence sum of 2. 07 v. u. The group, {{as well as the}} water solvent molecule, are well behaved in terms of crystallographic order, but the remaining three molecules in the structure display different kinds of disorder, viz. the two DMF molecules mimic a twofold splitting and the pds anion has both <b>S</b> atoms <b>clamped</b> at well-determined positions but with a not-too-well-defined central part. These peculiar behaviours are a consequence of the hydrogen-bonding interactions: the outermost SO 3 parts of the pds anion are heavily connected to the complex cations via C&# 8212;H [...] . O hydrogen bonding, generating an [Ni(phen) 3]pds network and providing for the stability of the terminal pds sites. Also, the water solvent molecule is strongly bound to the structure (being a donor of two strong bonds and an acceptor of one) and is accordingly perfectly ordered. The peroxide O atoms in the pds middle region, instead, appear as much less restrained into their sites, which may explain their tendency to disorder. The cation&# 8211;anion network leaves large embedded holes, amounting to about 28 % of the total crystal volume, which are occupied by the DMF molecules.

While some of these new approaches are being adopted in pharmaceutical companies, conventional patch-clamp remains unmatched in fundamental research due to its versatility. Here, we merged the patch clamp and atomic force microscope (AFM) techniques, thus equipping the patch-clamp with the sensitive AFM force control. This was possible using the FluidFM, a force-controlled nanopipette based on microchanneled AFM cantilevers. First, the compatibility of the system with patch-clamp electronics and its ability to record the activity of voltage-gated ion channels in whole-cell configuration was demonstrated with sodium (NaV 1. 5) channels.

Its effect on isotonic contractile properties (i. e. force-velocity relationship and power output) has not been studied. We hypothesized that hypoxia reduces velocity of shortening and consequently power output of the unfatigued muscle, and shortens endurance time during isotonic contractions. Force-velocity relationship, power output, and fatigue resistance of rat diaphragm muscle bundles were measured during hypoxia (PO 2 : 6. 6 +/- 0. 2 kPa) and compared with hyperoxia (PO 2 : 91. 8 +/- 0. 7 kPa). Force was clamped from 1 to 100 % of maximal tetanic force (Po). Fatigue during isotonic contractions was induced by repeated stimulation every 2 <b>s</b> at a <b>clamp</b> level of 33 % of Po.

In contrast, maximum shortening velocity decreased significantly (hypoxia: 4. 2 +/- 0. 3, hyperoxia: 6. 0 +/- 0. 2 Lo/s, P < 0. 05). The force-velocity curve shifted downwards (P < 0. 05). Hypoxia lowered power output at each load compared with hyperoxia (P < 0. 05). The isotonic endurance time was shorter during hypoxia compared with hyperoxia (80 +/- 2 vs. 130 +/- 3 s, P < 0. 05).

40|$|DNA replicases utilize {{ring-shaped}} sliding clamps {{to ensure}} polymerase processivity. An ATP-dependent clamp loader topologically links the clamp around DNA in a multi-step mechanism. Clamp loaders are ring-shaped pentamers of AAA+ subunits. The pentamer complex contains 3 - 4 ATP sites, each {{located at the}} interface of two subunits. In each ATP site, an arginine residue from one subunit is located near the Î³-phosphate of ATP bound to the adjacent subunit. These arginines act as â€œarginine fingersâ€ that can potentially perform two functions: sensing that ATP is bound and catalyzing ATP hydrolysis. This thesis utilizes mutations in the arginine fingers of the E. coli and <b>S.</b> cerevisiae <b>clamp</b> loaders {{in order to examine}} steps in the clamp loading mechanism after the clamp loader binds ATP. The E. coli Î³ complex couples ATP hydrolysis to the loading of Î² sliding clamps onto DNA. We demonstrate that the Î´ 2 ̆ 7 subunit of Î³ complex contributes an arginine finger into ATP site D. Hydrolysis in site D is inhibited by mutation of the Î³ subunit arginine finger, which affects sites B and C. The Î´ 2 ̆ 7 arginine finger also mediates Î² binding and the Î³ arginine fingers are important for DNA binding. Utilizing a three-subunit fusion construct, we determined that a single arginine finger mutation in either site B or C causes inactivation of Î³ complex. Replication factor C (RFC) loads the processivity clamp, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), onto DNA. ATP binding to RFC activates a Î³-phosphate sensor in ATP site C that promotes DNA association by RFC-PCNA. DNA binding to the RFC-PCNA complex then triggers the ATP hydrolysis cycle which starts in site C and ends with ATP site D. ATP hydrolysis in site D is uniquely stimulated by PCNA and we propose that this site is coupled to closure of PCNA around DNA. PCNA closure severs contact to RFC subunits D and E, and the Î³- phosphate sensor of ATP site C is switched off, leading to ejection of RFC from the site of PCNA loading. This work sheds light on conserved aspects of ATP site function that may extend to all clamp loaders...|$|R

However, electrophysiological characterization of the intestinal epithelium has not been possible because of its relative inaccessibility. We developed primary intestinal epithelial cell cultures that circumvent this problem. Intestinal cells express two highly Ca 2 +-selective, voltage-independent conductances. One conductance, IORCa, is constitutively active, exhibits strong outward rectification, is 60 – 70 -fold more selective for Ca 2 + than Na+, is inhibited by intracellular Mg 2 + with a K 1 / 2 of 692 μM, and is insensitive to Ca 2 + store depletion. Inhibition of IORCa with high intracellular Mg 2 + concentrations revealed the presence of a small amplitude conductance that was activated by passive depletion of intracellular Ca 2 + stores. Active depletion of Ca 2 + stores with IP 3 or ionomycin increased the rate of current activation ∼ 8 - and ∼ 22 -fold compared with passive store depletion. The store-operated conductance, ISOC, exhibits strong inward rectification, and the channel is highly selective for Ca 2 + over monovalent cations with a divalent cation selectivity sequence of Ca 2 + > Ba 2 + ≈ Sr 2 +. Reversal potentials for ISOC could not be detected accurately between 0 and + 80 mV, suggesting that PCa/PNa of the channel may exceed 1, 000 : 1. Lanthanum, SKF 96365, and 2 -APB inhibit both IORCa and ISOC reversibly. Our studies provide the first detailed electrophysiological characterization of voltage-independent Ca 2 + conductances in C. elegans and form the foundation for ongoing genetic and molecular studies aimed at identifying the genes that encode the intestinal cell channels, for defining mechanisms of channel regulation and for defining their roles in oscillatory Ca 2 + signaling...|$|R

These peculiar behaviours are a consequence of the hydrogen-bonding interactions: the outermost SO 3 parts of the pds anion are heavily connected to the complex cations via C?H O hydrogen bonding, generating an [Ni(phen) 3]pds network and providing for the stability of the terminal pds sites. Also, the water solvent molecule is strongly bound to the structure (being a donor of two strong bonds and an acceptor of one) and is accordingly perfectly ordered. The peroxide O atoms in the pds middle region, instead, appear as much less restrained into their sites, which may explain their tendency to disorder. The cation?anion network leaves large embedded holes, amounting to about 28 % of the total crystal volume, which are occupied by the DMF molecules. The latter are weakly interacting {{with the rest of the}} structure, which renders them much more labile and, accordingly, prone to disorder. Fil: Harvey, Miguel Angel.

40|$|Objectives: To measure paddle motion {{during the}} {{clamping}} {{phase of a}} breast phantom {{for a range of}} machine/paddle combinations. Methods: A deformable breast phantom was used to simulate a female breast. Twelve mammography machines from three manufacturers with twenty two flexible and twenty fixed paddles were evaluated. Vertical motion at the paddle was measured using two calibrated linear potentiometers. For each paddle, the motion in millimeters was recorded every 0. 5 seconds for 40 seconds while the phantom was compressed with 80 N. Independent t-tests were used to determine differences in paddle motion between flexible and fixed, small and large, GE Senographe Essential and Hologic Selenia Dimensions paddles. Paddle tilt in the medial-lateral plane for each machine/paddle combination was calculated. Results: All machine/paddle combinations demonstrate highest levels of motion during the first 10 <b>s</b> of the <b>clamping</b> phase. Least motion is 0. 17 ± 0. 05 mm/ 10 s (n= 20) and the most is 0. 51 ± 0. 15 mm/ 10 s (n= 80). There is a statistical difference in paddle motion between fixed and flexible (p< 0. 001), GE Senographe Essential and Hologic Selenia Dimensions paddles (p< 0. 001). Paddle tilt in the medial-lateral plane is independent of time and varied from 0. 04 ° to 0. 69 °. Conclusions: All machine/paddle combinations exhibited motion and tilting and the extent varied with machine and paddle sizes and types. Advances in knowledge: This research suggests that image blurring will likely be clinically insignificant 4 seconds or more after the clamping phase commences...|$|R
40|$|N-octanoyl {{dopamine}} (NOD) treatment improves renal function {{when applied}} to brain dead donors and {{in the setting of}} warm ischaemia-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). Because it also activates transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV 1) channels, we first assessed if NOD conveys its renoprotective properties in warm ischaemia-induced AKI via TRPV 1 and secondly, if renal transplant recipients also benefit from NOD treatment. We induced warm renal ischaemia in Lewis, wild-type (WT) and TRPV 1 (-/-) Sprague-Dawley (<b>sd)</b> rats by <b>clamping</b> the left renal artery for 45 min. Transplantations were performed in allogeneic and syngeneic donor-recipient combinations (Fisher to Lewis and Lewis to Lewis) with a cold ischaemia time of 20 h. Treatment was instituted directly after restoration of organ perfusion. Renal function, histology and perfusion were assessed by serum creatinine, microscopy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using arterial spin labelling (ASL). NOD treatment significantly improved renal function in Lewis rats after warm ischaemia-induced AKI. It was, however, not effective after prolonged cold ischaemia. The renoprotective properties of NOD were only observed in Lewis or WT, but not in TRPV 1 (-/-) sd rats. Renal inflammation was significantly abrogated by NOD. MRI-ASL showed a significantly lower cortical perfusion in ischaemic when compared with non-ischaemic kidneys. No overall differences were observed in renal perfusion between NOD- and NaCl-treated rats. NOD treatment reduces renal injury in warm ischaemia, but is not effective in renal transplant in our experimental animal models. The salutary effect of NOD appears to be TPRV 1 -dependent, not involving large changes in renal perfusion...|$|R
40|$|Spontaneously active single {{cells have}} been {{obtained}} from the sinus venosus region of the bull-frog, Rana catesbeiana, using an enzymic dispersion procedure involving serial applications of trypsin, collagenase and elastase in nominally 0 Ca 2 + Ringer solution. These cells have normal action potentials and fire spontaneously at a rate {{very similar to the}} intact sinus venosus. A single suction micro-electrode technique (Hamill, Marty, Neher, Sakmann & Sigworth, 1981; Hume & Giles, 1983) has been used to record the spontaneous diastolic depolarizations or pace-maker activity as well as the regenerative action potentials in these cells. This electrophysiological activity is completely insensitive to tetrodotoxin (TTX; 3 X 10 (- 6) M) and is very similar to that recorded from an in vitro sinus venosus preparation. The present experiments were aimed at identifying the transmembrane potassium currents, and analysing their role(s) {{in the development of the}} pace-maker potential and the repolarization of the action potential. Depolarizing voltage-clamp steps from the normal maximum diastolic potential (- 75 mV) elicit a time- and voltage-dependent activation of an outward current. The reversal potential of this current in normal Ringer solution [(K+] 0 2. 5 mM) is near - 95 mV; and it shifts by 51 mV per tenfold increase in [K+] 0, which strongly suggests that this current is carried by K+. We therefore labelled it IK. The reversal potential of IK did not shift in the positive direction following very long (20 <b>s)</b> depolarizing <b>clamp</b> steps to + 20 mV, indicating that 'extracellular' accumulation of [K+] 0 does not produce any significant artifacts. The fully activated instantaneous current-voltage (I-V) relationship for IK is approximately linear over the range of potentials - 130 to - 30 mV. Thus, the ion transfer mechanism of IK may be described as a simple ohmic conductance in this range of potentials. Positive relative to - 30 mV, however, the I-V exhibits significant inward rectification. A Hodgkin-Huxley analysis of the kinetics of IK, including a demonstration that the envelope of tails quantitatively matches the time course of the onset of IK during a prolonged depolarizing clamp step has been completed. The steady-state activation variable (n infinity) of IK spans the voltage range approximately - 40 to + 10 mV. It is well-fitted by a Boltzmann distribution function with half-activation at - 20 mV. The time course of decay of IK is a single exponential. However, the activation or onset of IK shows clear sigmoidicity in the range of potentials from the activation threshold (- 40 mV) to 0 mV.

40|$|Abstract】Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} electrical stimulation to sacral spinal nerve 3 (S 3 stimulation) on gastrointestinal dysfunction after spinal cord injury (SCI). Methods: Six rabbits were taken as normal controls to record their gastrointestinal multipoint biological discharge, colon pressure and rectoanal inhibitory refl ex. Electrodes were implanted into S 3 in another 18 rabbits. Then the model of SCI was conducted following Fehling’s method: the rabbit <b>S</b> 3 was <b>clamped</b> to induce transverse injury, which was claimed by both somatosensory evoked potential and motion evoked potential. Two hours after SCI, S 3 stimulation was conducted. The 18 rabbits were subdivided into 3 groups to respectively record their gastrointestinal electric activities (n= 6), colon pressure (n= 6), and rectum pressure (n= 6). Firstly the wave frequency was fi xed at 15 Hz and pulse width at 400 μs and three stimulus intensities (6 V, 8 V, 10 V) were tested. Then the voltage was fixed at 6 V and the pulse width changed from 200 μs, 400 μs to 600 μs. The response was recorded and analyzed. The condition of defecation was also investigated. Results: After SCI, the mainly demonstrated change was dyskinesia of the single haustrum and distal colon. The rectoanal inhibitory reflex almost disappeared. S 3 stimulation partly recovered the intestinal movement after denervation, promoting defecation. The proper stimulus parameters were 15 Hz, 400 μs, 6 V, 10 s with 20 s intervals and 10 min with 10 min intervals, total 2 h. Conclusion: S 3 stimulation is able to restore the intestinal movement after denervation (especially single haustrum and distal colon), which promotes defecation.

40|$|This shroud {{provides}} a deep-space simulating environment for testing scaled-down models of passively cooling systems for spaceflight optics and instruments. It is used inside a liquid-nitrogen- cooled vacuum chamber, {{and it is}} cooled by liquid helium to 5 K. It has an inside geometry of approximately 1. 6 m diameter by 0. 45 m tall. The inside surfaces of its top and sidewalls have a thermal absorptivity greater than 0. 96. The bottom wall has a large central opening that is easily customized to allow a specific test item to extend through it. This enables testing of scale models of realistic passive cooling configurations that feature a very large temperature drop between the deepspace-facing cooled side and the Sun/Earth-facing warm side. This shroud has an innovative thermal closeout of the bottom wall, so that a test sample can have a hot (room temperature) side outside of the shroud, and a cold side inside the shroud. The combination of this closeout and the very black walls keeps radiated heat from the sample s warm end from entering the shroud, reflecting off the walls and heating the sample s cold end. The shroud includes 12 vertical rectangular sheet-copper side panels that are oriented in a circular pattern. Using tabs bent off from their edges, these side panels are bolted {{to each other and}} to a steel support ring on which they rest. The removable shroud top is a large copper sheet that rests on, and is bolted to, the support ring when the shroud is closed. The support ring stands on four fiberglass tube legs, which isolate it thermally from the vacuum chamber bottom. The insides of the cooper top and side panels are completely covered with 25 - mm-thick aluminum honeycomb panels. This honeycomb is painted black before it is epoxied to the copper surfaces. A spiral-shaped copper tube, clamped at many different locations to the outside of the top copper plate, serves as part of the liquid helium cooling loop. Another copper tube, plumbed in a series to the top plate <b>s</b> tube, is <b>clamped</b> to the sidewall tabs where they are bolted to the support ring. Flowing liquid helium through these tubes cools the entire shroud to 5 K. The entire shroud is wrapped loosely in a layer of double-aluminized Kapton. The support ring s inner diameter is the largest possible hole through which the test item can extend into the shroud. Twelve custom-sized trapezoidal copper sheets extend inward from the support ring to within a few millimeters of the test item. Attached to the inner edge of each of these sheets is a custom-shaped strip of Kapton, which is aluminum- coated on the warm-facing (outer) side, and has thin Dacron netting attached to its cold-facing side. This Kapton rests against the test item, but the Dacron keeps it from making significant thermal contact. The result is a non-contact, radiatively reflective thermal closeout with essentially no gap through which radiation can pass. In this way, the part of the test item outside the shroud can be heated to relatively high temperatures without any radiative heat leaking to the inside...|$|R
