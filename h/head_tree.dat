60|$|And then a very tidy little modern {{carriage}} bustled up the road, a brougham {{made for}} a pair of horses which was well known to all hunting men in these parts. It was very unpretending in its colour and harness; but no vehicle more appropriate to its purpose ever carried two thorough-going sportsmen day after day about the country. In this as it pulled up under the <b>head</b> <b>tree</b> of the avenue were seated the two Miss Tristrams. The two Miss Tristrams were well known to the Hamworth Hunt--I will not merely say as fearless riders,--of most girls who hunt as much can be said as that; but they were judicious horsewomen; they knew when to ride hard, and when hard riding, as regarded any necessary for the hunt, would be absolutely thrown away. They might be seen for half the day moving about the roads as leisurely, or standing as quietly at the covert's side as might the seniors of the fields. But when the time for riding did come, when the hounds were really running--when other young ladies had begun to go home--then the Miss Tristrams were always there;--there or thereabouts, as their admirers would warmly boast.|$|E

Our best model achieves an-score of 43. 2 % for labelled discourse relations and 67. 9 % for unlabelled ones, significantly beating a right-branching baseline that uses the most frequent relations. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Large flash disks {{have become}} an {{attractive}} alternative to magnetic hard disks, due to their high random read performance, low energy consumption and other features. However, writes, especially random writes, on the flash disk are inherently much slower than reads because of the erase-beforewrite mechanism. To address this asymmetry of read-write speeds in indexing on the flash disk, we propose the FD-tree, a tree index designed with the logarithmic method and fractional cascading techniques. With the logarithmic method, an FD-tree consists of the <b>head</b> <b>tree</b> – a small B+-tree on the top, and a few levels of sorted runs of increasing sizes at the bottom. This design is write-optimized for the flash disk; in particular, an index search will potentially go through more levels or visit more nodes, but random writes are limited to the <b>head</b> <b>tree</b> and are subsequently transformed into sequential ones through merging into the lower runs. With the fractional cascading technique, we store pointers, called fences, in lower level runs {{to speed up the}} search. We evaluate the FD-tree in comparison with representative B+-tree variants under a variety of workloads. Our results show that the FD-tree has a similar search performance to the standard B+tree, and a similar update performance to the write-optimized B+-tree variant. As a result, FD-tree outperforms all these B+-tree index variants on both update- and search-intensive workloads. I...|$|E

However, writes, especially random writes, on the flash disk are inherently much slower than reads because of the erase-before-write mechanism. To address this asymmetry of read-write speeds in indexing on the flash disk, we propose the FD-tree, a tree index designed with the logarithmic method and fractional cascading techniques. With the logarithmic method, an FD-tree consists of the <b>head</b> <b>tree</b> – a small B+-tree on the top, and a few levels of sorted runs of increasing sizes at the bottom. This design is write-optimized for the flash disk; in particular, an index search will potentially go through more levels or visit more nodes, but random writes are limited to a small area – the <b>head</b> <b>tree,</b> and are subsequently transformed into sequential ones through merging into the lower runs. With the fractional cascading technique, we store pointers, called fences, in lower level runs {{to speed up the}} search. Given a FD-tree of n entries, we analytically show that it supports updates in O(logBn) sequential I/Os and preserve the search efficiency in O(logBn) random I/Os, where B is the page size. We evaluate the FD-tree in comparison with representative B+-tree variants under a variety of workloads on both mid-class and high-end flash SSDs. Our results show that the FD-tree has a similar search performance to the standard B+-tree, and a similar update performance to the write-optimized B+-tree variant. As a result, FD-tree outperforms all these B+-tree index variants on both update- and search-intensive workloads...|$|E
40|$|The end of {{the study}} is to {{determine}} the optimum location of the skyline for the cable crane by using the electronic computer (HITAC 8700) from the technical and economical point of view. First of all, the topographic map, on a scale of 1 : 2500, including the harvesting area is prepared and matrix is laid out on the map. The harvesting area can be approximately enclosed by tens of straight lines connecting boundary points, i. e. A, B, C, [...] (Fig. 4). The configuration of the terrain surface is represented by the cubic curved face. So the elevation at any point in the area is computed {{on the basis of the}} elevation at adjacent intersection points. Many lines are drawn from the <b>head</b> <b>tree</b> (H) through the harvwsting area (Fig. 5). Those lines are assumed to be called "planning line". On each planning line, the possibility of setting the tail tree is examined. And if possible, the optimum point for the tail tree on the line is determined. Then, the possibility of the timber yarding in lateral direction is examined in accordance with the configuration of the ground surface along the lateral yarding lines, and also the limiting load of one yarding operation from each point of the harvesting area is determined by calculating the tension of the skyline and operating lines. The yarding time at every point can be calculated in accordance with the yarding distance and the limiting load in one yarding operation. The total required time of each planning line should be calculated as integration of the yarding time at every point in order to find the optimum skyline setting. The total required time for yarding operation is determined by the position of each tail tree. The optimum position of each skyline can be found as the position where the total required time for yarding is minimized. The optimum setting number of the skyline is determined as the number to make the total required time for yarding and the time for replacing the skyline system minimize. Figure 12 is a topographic map on a scale of 1 : 2500 on which the timber harvesting area and the position of the <b>head</b> <b>tree</b> are laid out. Figure 13, 14 and 15 illustrate the optimum position of the tail tree (s) for one skyline setting, two and three respectively. The numeral values printed out by computer in Fig. 13, 14 and 15 show the difficulty of the yarding operation, e. g. 1 :Very easy, 8 :Very difficult. Comparing the three cases, printer output tells that the optimum number of skyline setting is two settings. Figure 16 illustrates the yarding range of each skyline...|$|E
40|$|In a <b>headed</b> <b>tree,</b> each {{terminal}} word can be uniquely {{labeled with}} a governing word and grammatical relation. This labeling is {{a summary of}} a syntactic analysis which eliminates detail, reflects aspects of semantics, and for some grammatical relations (such as subject of finite verb) is nearly uncontroversial. We define a notion of expected governor markup, which sums vectors indexed by governors and scaled by probabilistic tree weights. The quantity is computed in a parse forest representation of the set of tree analyses for a given sentence, using vector sums and scaling by inside probability and flow. ...|$|R
