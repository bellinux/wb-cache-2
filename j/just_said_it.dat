I had used it in In His Own Write, {{but it was an}} off-the-cuff remark by Ringo. You know, one of those malapropisms. A Ringo-ism, where he said it not to be funny... <b>just</b> <b>said</b> <b>it.</b> So Dick Lester said, 'We are going to use that title.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The Pike Place Fish Market was {{purchased}} in 1965 by John Yokoyama, {{a former employee}} of the fish market, who bought the store to make enough money on an owner's salary to afford the car payments on his new Buick Riviera. Initially, Pike Place Fish Market was unknown outside of the Seattle area, but Yokoyama and his staff decided to change that {{in a meeting with}} a business coach in 1986. Prior to the meeting, the Pike Place Fish Market was near to bankruptcy, and the consultant, Jim Bergquist, was helping them to conceive of ways to save the business. A fish market employee at the meeting suggested that they not only save the business, but make it [...] "world famous", with the ideas for the business' flying and thrown fish, games with customers, and staff attitudes of always enjoying their work, so that customers would as well. In an interview, Yokoyama stated, [...] "We took a stand {{that we were going to}} become world famous. We <b>just</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> and it became so." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] was {{directed}} by Francis Lawrence, and filmed in Malibu, California, {{during the week of}} October 29, 2002. Lawrence created the video's concept and told MTV News, [...] " [...] had a conversation on the phone and all he said was he wanted to have some dancing in it, but to do my thing. He told me what the song was about, but in a [...] as well. He <b>just</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was a kiss-off song and so I came up with this idea and he went for it". Lawrence added that he also included some details in the video, including a reference to Spears's tattoo, which Timberlake enjoyed. He explained that he and Timberlake did not mention names while creating the video, only discussing the song's general beats. Lawrence also revealed that executives of Jive Records were nervous about some aspects of the video, such as Timberlake's representation of a voyeur and the tone of some scenes he was portraying with a girl. [...] "That's the thing I liked most about this project, was that he was coming into it with a super clean-cut image with 'N Sync and he's such a nice guy and so handsome and what I was into doing was making him be a bit scary. Lurking around the house in the rain, throwing a rock through her window, being a peeping Tom, getting revenge and doing stuff that's not really what a nice guy does." [...] The music video for [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] was released onto the iTunes Store on April 28, 2003.|$|E

2500|$|Starr's {{statement}} was {{the inspiration for}} the title of the film, which in turn inspired the composition of the song. According to Lennon in a 1980 interview with Playboy magazine: [...] "I was going home in the car and Dick Lester [...] suggested the title, 'Hard Day's Night' from something Ringo had said. I had used it in In His Own Write , but it was an off-the-cuff remark by Ringo. You know, one of those malapropisms.

2500|$|On 4 August 2011 at {{the interim}} results {{announcement}} for Hutchison Whampoa, Li endorsed Henry Tang for the forthcoming chief executive election. Then Li said [...] "You all {{can be just}} like me, one-person-one-vote (一人一票)." [...] The media then looked at Li in disbelief, and pointed out that regular citizens do not get one-person-one-vote. Li then tried to laugh it off and said [...] "maybe in 2017 they will have one-person-one-vote to choose the chief executive, I probably <b>just</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> a little early." [...] Li was, however, criticised by Xinhua for not being unambiguous in {{his opposition to the}} Umbrella movement protests and his support for Leung. Later, prior to the Legco vote, Li said that the largest threat to Hong Kong's future was if the government failed to ensure passage of the 2014–5 round of political reform.|$|E

5000|$|Medine {{started the}} Man Repeller blog in May 2010 as a hobby, {{blogging}} from her parents' {{apartment on the}} Upper East Side. The idea for the blog came {{during a trip to}} Topshop with friend Rachel Strugatz, now an online editor at Women's Wear Daily. Medine recalled, [...] "We were laughing at how everything was so man-repelling: acid-washed harem pants and enormous shoulder pads, and I <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> 'That's <b>it!</b> That's the blog.'" ...|$|R

5000|$|It {{was during}} the {{recording}} of Three Snakes that the band decided to introduce new elements into the music, the most noticeable being a horn section on [...] "(Only) Halfway to Everywhere" [...] and [...] "Let Me Share The Ride." [...] "That was the Dirty Dozen Brass Band," [...] Rich commented in 1996. [...] "They opened for us last year (1995) through the whole American leg of (our) tour.

Music never accompanies the story itself, only {{those parts of the}} text where Voice is self-referential. However, when music follows the Woburn story it reflects what has <b>just</b> been <b>said,</b> <b>it</b> extracts the emotional component from it and presents it in isolation.

6000|$|Once {{there was}} a good little boy by the name of Jacob Blivens. He always obeyed his parents, no matter how absurd and {{unreasonable}} their demands were; and he always learned his book, and never was late at Sabbath-school. He would not play hookey, even when his sober judgment told him it was the most profitable thing he could do. None of the other boys could ever make that boy out, he acted so strangely. He wouldn't lie, no matter how convenient it was. He <b>just</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was wrong to lie, and that was sufficient for him. And he was so honest that he was simply ridiculous. The curious ways that that Jacob had, surpassed everything. He wouldn't play marbles on Sunday, he wouldn't rob birds' nests, he wouldn't give hot pennies to organ-grinders' monkeys; he didn't seem to take any interest in any kind of rational amusement. So the other boys used to try to reason it out and come to an understanding of him, but they couldn't arrive at any satisfactory conclusion. As I said before, they could only figure out a sort of vague idea that he was [...] "afflicted," [...] and so they took him under their protection, and never allowed any harm to come to him.|$|E
6000|$|... § 17. How far Turner {{followed}} it, is {{not easily}} shown; for his finish is so delicate as to be nearly uncopiable. I have <b>just</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> {{was not possible to}} finish that ash trunk of his, farther, on such a scale.[42] By using a magnifying-glass, and giving the same help to the spectator, it might perhaps be possible to add and exhibit a few more details; but even as it is, I cannot by line engraving express all that there is in that piece of tree-trunk, on the same scale. I have therefore magnified the upper part of it in fig 4. (Plate 5.), so that the reader may better see the beautiful lines of curvature into which even its slightest shades and spots are cast. Every quarter of an inch in Turner's drawings will bear magnifying in the same way; much of the finer work in them can hardly be traced, except by the keenest sight, until it is magnified. In his painting of Ivy Bridge,[43] the veins are drawn on the wings of a butterfly, not above three lines in diameter; and in one of his smaller drawings of Scarborough, in my own possession, the muscle-shells on the beach are rounded, and some shown as shut, some as open, though none are as large as one of the letters of this type; and yet {{this is the man who}} was thought to belong to the [...] "dashing" [...] school, literally because most people had not patience or delicacy of sight enough to trace his endless detail.|$|E
