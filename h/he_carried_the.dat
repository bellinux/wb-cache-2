5|$|Early in 1307, Edward I {{made his}} last grant to Warwick, {{when he gave}} him John Balliol's {{forfeited}} lordship of Barnard Castle in County Durham. On 7 July that year, near Burgh by Sands in Cumberland, Warwick was present when King Edward died. Together with Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, and Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, <b>he</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> ceremonial swords at the coronation of King Edward II on 25 February 1308.|$|E
5|$|Pickett was {{commissioned}} a brevet second {{lieutenant in the}} 8th Infantry Regiment. He soon gained national recognition in the Mexican–American War when <b>he</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> American colors over the parapet during the Battle of Chapultepec in September 1847. Wounded {{at the base of}} the wall, Pickett's friend and colleague Lieutenant James Longstreet handed him the colors. Pickett carried the flag over the wall and fought his way to the roof of the palace, unfurling it over the fortress and announcing its surrender. He received a brevet promotion to captain following this action.|$|E

He also recoved two fumbles, {{returned}} 15 punts for 114 yards, and returned 14 kickoffs for 326 yards. Pollard's best season statistically was in 1952, when, in 12 games, he rushed for 186 yards and his sole touchdown in the NFL, received eight passes for 59 yards, recovered three fumbles, and returned 28 kickoffs for 528 yards. In 1953, he played in 12 games which saw him rush for 44 yards and receive for 33, recover three fumbles, gain 106 yards in 20 punt returns, and gain 150 yards in 13 kickoff returns.|$|E
5|$|Loxton had {{no success}} in the first {{representative}} match, scoring 2 and 6 and taking 0/72 in an innings defeat. However, his fortunes turned in the next match against Bombay, when he took 5/92, the first five-wicket innings haul in his first-class career. He also scored 123, {{but was unable to}} force a victory. <b>He</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> form into the next representative match, scoring 55 and taking a total of 3/99 in a drawn encounter. The Victorian continued his all-round form against Bengal, scoring 100 and taking 5/87 in an innings victory. His form tapered away thereafter and he failed to pass 40 and took only a total of only four wickets in the three remaining representative matches. The Commonwealth outfit won the third match but lost the fourth, ceding the series 2–1. Loxton ended the tour with 647 runs at 35.94 and 33 wickets at 31.90, but struggled in the matches against India, scoring 148 runs at 21.14 and taking 7 wickets at 56.14.|$|E

Air Force fullback Pat Evans led the team with 159carries for 1,015rushing yards. Air Force quarterback Bart Weiss also was known more for his running than his passing. Weiss {{finished}} the regular season with just 41completions for 668yards and threetouchdowns. <b>He</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> ball 126times for 540yards and 10touchdowns.

5|$|Taking {{over after}} the missed field goal, Georgia Tech {{was unable to}} gain a first down. After the Yellow Jackets punted the ball away, Wake Forest {{continued}} to have the increased offensive success they had shown in their previous drive. This time, it was running back Kenneth Moore who picked {{up the majority of}} the Deacons' yardage, as <b>he</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> ball eight times during the drive. Toward the end of the drive, Wake Forest was assisted by a 10-yard penalty against the Yellow Jackets, which drove them inside Georgia Tech's red zone. There, however, Tech's defense stiffened. Despite having a first down at Tech's 10-yard line, Wake was unable to score a touchdown. Kicker Sam Swank again came into the game to attempt a field goal, and connected on a 19-yard field goal. The kick tied the score at 33 with just 58 seconds remaining in the first half.|$|E
5|$|At Clemson, Scott threw a four-yard {{touchdown}} pass to quarterback Danny O'Brien on a trick play for Maryland's only score in a 317 loss. He had four rushing attempts for 18yards. During that game, Scott became the tenth player in school history to amass 3,000 all-purpose yards. At Boston College, Scott rushed nine times for 19yards and caught one pass for four yards. He also filled in for injured kickoff returner Torrey Smith and had one return for 25yards. Against Wake Forest, he had eleven carries for 50yards and one reception for tenyards. At Miami, Scott rushed nine times for 30yards and had a 12-yard reception. At Virginia, <b>he</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> ball 11times for 55yards and had two catches for eight yards including a two-yard reception for a touchdown. Against 25th-ranked Florida State, Scott rushed ten times for 87yards and caught two passes for eight yards. Scott was held to negative ten rushing yards on four touches by 23rd-ranked North Carolina State in his final home game on Senior Night, but Maryland still won, 3831.|$|E
5|$|Edward IV died {{suddenly}} in April 1483, leaving his young son, Edward his heir and the Duke of Gloucester Lord Protector {{of the new}} king and the country. Although he had been summoned to the parliament of January 1483, {{it is unlikely that}} Suffolk was in attendance at court at the time. Nor did he attend the dead king's funeral or interment. By July, the young king had been declared illegitimate; Suffolk was at Westminster Hall on 26 June 1483 when Gloucester claimed the throne, and <b>he</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> royal sceptre at Richard's coronation. Suffolk's son, the Earl of Lincoln, was named as Richard III's heir to the throne when the king's own son, Edward of Middleham died in 1484. However, Suffolk did lose the Constableship of Wallinford and the Chiltern Hundreds to Lovell. In fact, Suffolk seems to have been no more favoured by Richard than he had been by Edward. In December 1483 Suffolk was summoned to the parliament which confirmed Richrd III's right to the throne, and the following year he undertook commissions of array in both Norfolk and Suffolk, as well as being part of the oyer and terminer which condemned the treasons of William Collingbourne in London.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-14th century Book of Offices of Pseudo-Kodinos, the prōtostratōr is {{the fifth}} highest non-imperial office (eighth overall), coming after the megas doux and before the megas logothetes. Its {{insignia}} of office {{were similar to those}} of the megas doux, i.e. a rich silk kabbadion tunic, a golden-red skiadion hat decorated with embroideries in the klapoton style, without veil, or a domed skaranikon hat, again in red and gold and decorated with golden wire, with a portrait of the emperor standing in front, and another of him enthroned in the rear. Only his staff of office (dikanikion) differed, with only the topmost carved knots in gold, and the rest in silver. The knobs in the staff remained gold, bordered with silver braid. According to Pseudo-Kodinos, the prōtostratōr retained some functions, mostly ceremonial, echoing his origin as a stable master: <b>he</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> emperor's sword, he led the emperor's horse when he left the palace, although the actual responsibility for the emperor's horses now rested with the komēs tōn basilikōn hippōn ("count of the imperial horses"). In war, the prōtostratōr was responsible for the irregulars ("those who have neither order nor their own banner") and scouts who preceded the army.|$|E
5|$|Jaekle {{kicked off}} to the Maryland 30-yard line where it was {{returned}} by Green for two yards. A fresh Da'Rel Scott then made his first appearance in the game. <b>He</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> ball four times in succession {{to advance to the}} Nevada 46-yard line. On third down with nine yards to go, Turner was sacked by defensive lineman Kevin Basped and the ball was knocked loose. It was picked up by Wolf Pack linebacker Brandon Marshall who then also fumbled. Maryland offensive lineman Scott Burley recovered it on the Nevada 45-yard line. The alternating changes in possession gave Maryland a first down, and Turner then connected with Darrius Heyward-Bey on an 11-yard pass for another first down. Scott rushed twice to pick up a first down at the Nevada 23-yard line. After a rush by Meggett, Turner was sacked by defensive end Dontay Moch and again fumbled. This time, Nevada recovered the ball and retained possession. Kaepernick then passed to wide receiver Mike McCoy for 38yards to the Maryland 27-yard line. Vai Taua picked up seven yards on a rush attempt, and the quarter came to an end with Maryland leading, 28–21.|$|E
5|$|Warner {{made his}} Test debut against New Zealand in December 2011, and scored his first {{century in the}} second match of the series when he made 123 not out. <b>He</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> bat in the fourth innings of the match, which Australia lost by seven runs. He {{followed}} that with a 69-ball century in the third match of home series against India in January 2012. It was the joint-fourth fastest in terms of balls faced at the time, and remains the fastest century by an opener in Tests. In November 2015, Warner made 163 and 116 in a match against New Zealand, and became the third batsmen in Test cricket to score centuries in both innings of a Test match on three occasions. In the next game at the WACA Ground in Perth, he scored 253, which remains his highest score in the format. In January 2017, while playing against Pakistan at the Sydney Cricket Ground, he became the fifth cricketer to score a century before lunch {{on the first day}} of the Test match and the first to do so in Australia. , he has twenty centuries in the format, with four centuries each against India, New Zealand and South Africa.|$|E

5|$|Penn State {{received}} the opening kickoff, {{and on their}} first play from scrimmage, featured six offensive linemen (albeit unsuccessfully, as Bill Belton rushed for a one-yard loss), before driving down the field on a 13-play, 75-yard drive that culminated with Belton rushing for a five-yard touchdown; <b>he</b> <b>carried</b> <b>the</b> load on the drive, rushing the ball eight times for 36 yards. Penn State would never relinquish that lead. Purdue subsequently went three-and-out, and Penn State responded with another long drive (10 plays, 66 yards) that again culminated with a rushing touchdown, this time from Zach Zwinak on a one-yard run, his tenth touchdown of the season, becoming the 16th Penn State player to eclipse 10, and the first since 2008, when both Evan Royster and Daryll Clark did. Purdue's ensuing drive ended {{in the second quarter}} when quarterback Danny Etling threw a two-yard touchdown pass to Justin Sinz, making the score 14–7 Penn State. Bill Belton lost a fumble on Penn State's next drive, but Purdue turned the ball over right back to Penn State when Jordan Lucas intercepted an Etling pass. Zwinak rushed for his second one-yard touchdown of the game on the ensuing possession. The Nittany Lions scored once more in the first half, via an eight-yard pass from Christian Hackenberg to Adam Breneman, but on the ensuing kickoff, Purdue's Raheem Mostert scored a touchdown on a 100-yard return, thus ending the first half with a score of 28–14, Penn State holding the advantage. Purdue came out of halftime with a vengeance, driving down the field for 84-yards, ultimately pulling within 7 points on an 11-yard rush by Etling. The first field goal of the game occurred on Penn State's subsequent drive, a 29-yarder from Sam Ficken putting the Nittany Lions ahead 31–21. The Boilermakers turned the ball over again on their next drive, and Penn State capitalized when Zwinak rushed for his third touchdown of the game. Purdue turned the ball over on downs their final drive of the third quarter, though Hackenberg threw an interception giving Purdue an opportunity early in the fourth quarter; again, a fumble eliminated any chance of a scoring drive coming to fruition, and Penn State went up 45–21 when Hackenberg rushed for a 4-yard touchdown to culminate an 11-play, 74-yard drive that encapsulated over a third of the fourth quarter, and ended with 4:27 to play. That would be the final scoring drive of the game, which Penn State won by the aforementioned score, 45–21.|$|E
