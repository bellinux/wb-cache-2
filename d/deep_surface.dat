The storm traveled at a rapid pace of [...] but continued to organize. By October11, the hurricane began to undergo an extratropical transition as it continued to move unusually fast towards the northeast. Around this time, Fran attained its peak winds of 80mph (130km/h). Shortly after bypassing the Azores islands on October12, the system moved over an area with sea surface temperatures around , well below what is required for tropical cyclone development. Later that day, the central pressure of Fran decreased to 978mbar (hPa; 28.88inHg), the lowest recorded {{in relation to the}} hurricane. Shortly after reaching this intensity, the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and quickly merged with a cold front off the coast of France.|$|E

40|$|Complex large {{landslides}} {{are characterized}} by different kinematic behaviors and involve diverse materials. Both elements {{make it difficult to}} study the instability of these huge mass movements, which may cause massive damage and affect extended areas. This paper is focused on the study of Spriana landslide, an important rockslide located in the North of Italy. Starting from the geological interpretation provided by Belloni and Gandolfo (Geologia tecnica ed ambientale 3 : 7 – 36, 1997), the authors gather all available data sets and perform a novel analysis aimed to better describe the unstable body. The key point of this case study regards the characterization of the <b>deeper</b> <b>surface</b> of failure. The location as well as the continuity of this surface is a crucial unsolved question, and in this paper we try to provide a reasonable answer. We propose a new hypothesis based on a structurally controlled, wedge-like rockslide involving the presence of a composed <b>deeper</b> <b>surface</b> of failure constrained by the intersection of two different weak zones. Although this work mainly addresses {{the development of a new}} geological model, numerical simulations were also performed. Both continuous and discontinuous models were tested, and then a comparison of the outcomes of the numerical simulations was performed to define the best fit to the observed landslide behavior...|$|R
40|$|Western {{research}} has characterized approaches to learning for specific learning tasks as discrete <b>deep</b> and <b>surface</b> approaches, distinguished by whether the {{intention is to}} understand or memorize. A more appropriate classification scheme for Hong Kong research is a continuum between <b>deep</b> and <b>surface</b> poles. In this article, the authors examine whether this characterization applies also to the West. University students in Australia (n = 1, 146) and Hong Kong (n = 1, 266) complete the revised Study Process Questionnaire. There are no effects by either discipline or study level in either country. Multiple-group analyses using structural equation modeling show configural invariance across the two samples, suggesting that the continuum characterization of approaches to learning {{is likely to be}} applicable for Western counterparts. Hong Kong students had higher mean scores for both <b>deep</b> and <b>surface</b> approaches, showing their greater use of intermediate approaches. © 2008 Sage Publications. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Conflict ideas exist in publications about which parameters can better define fatigue endurance. The traditional one was Arithmetic Average Roughness, although <b>deepest</b> <b>surface</b> feature and the square {{root of the}} defect area were proposed. The combinations of these factors including high temperature, metallurgical alternations and plastic deformations, rather than the residual stress alone affect surface topography and surface integrity. They should be examined carefully {{in order to gain}} a better understanding of fatigue...|$|R

This has been hypothesized {{to account for the}} [...] "missing" [...] intermediate-luminosity LBVs and the presence of yellow hypergiants at approximately the same luminosity and cooler temperatures. The yellow hypergiants are actually the LBVs having formed a pseudo-photosphere and so apparently having a lower temperature.|$|R

Richards, 'Restoration {{and balance}} of complex folded and faulted rock volumes: {{flexural}} flattening, jigsaw fitting and decompaction in three dimensions', Tectonophysics, Vol. 273, Issues 3 - 4, May 1997, pp. 203 - 218, DOI: [URL] (96) 00282 -X Copyright ?? 1997 Published by Elsevier B. V. Techniques of two-dimensional bed length and cross-sectional area restoration are extended into true, three-dimensional (3 -D) restorations using {{the preservation of}} areas of individual surfaces plus conservation of volume between surfaces. The flexural flattening technique involves the restoration of a complexly folded surface to a horizontal plane while conserving surface area and minimising finite strain. Multiple surfaces showing superimposed non-co-axial folding may be restored using the flexural flattening method applied to successively <b>deeper</b> <b>surfaces.</b> In the process of sequential restoration, volumes between the uppermost flattened surface and underlying surfaces are preserved and therefore the method is volume-balanced. The jigsaw fit of footwall and hangingwall cut-offs of each flattened surface, in map view, provides a unique restoration solution based on a unique translation and/or rotation of the hangingwall block. Flexural flattening and jigsaw fit performed sequentially on successively <b>deeper</b> <b>surfaces</b> in a three-dimensional model may incorporate removal of the uppermost layer and three-dimensional decompaction at each restoration step. The method is applied to a synthetic 3 -D growth fault structure which has been produced using multiple discrete slip vectors and bulk simple shear hangingwall deformation...|$|R

40|$|Stable isotope {{analyses}} were performed on ontogenetic dissections of four taxa of low latitude Late Cretaceous planktonic foraminifera from DSDP Hole 390 A. The species studied include Planoglobulina acervulinoides, Planoglobulina multicamerata, Pseudoguembelina palpebra, and Racemiguembelina fructicosa. Delta 18 O and delta 13 C data indicate a <b>deeper</b> <b>surface</b> water paleohabitat for P. multicamerata than the other three taxa, and ontogenetic increases in delta 18 O values suggest all these taxa underwent vertical migrations from shallow to <b>deeper</b> <b>surface</b> waters. Changes in delta 13 C values through ontogeny include sharp increases in delta 13 C composition in the juvenile size intervals, {{a decrease in the}} rate of delta 13 C change through intermediate size intervals, and reversals to a negative trend in delta 13 C values in terminal size intervals. The intermediate and terminal growth changes in delta 13 C signals are similar to ontogenetic trends observed in some extant and Paleogene planktonic foraminifera and may result from decreasing metabolic rates through ontogeny or endosymbiont digestion prior to gametogenesis. The ontogenetic delta 13 C increases of 1. 04 ?, 0. 76 ?, 0. 83 ?, and 0. 77 ? in R. fructicosa, P. palpebra, P. acervulinoides, and P. multicamerata, respectively, may indicate the presence of photosymbionts. However, our review and critique of the current literature discussing photosymbiont effects on stable isotope values in living and fossil planktonic foraminifera suggests that conclusions regarding the presence of photosymbionts in fossil taxa may be more equivocal than previously thought...|$|R

Firstly, learners&# 039; preferences for <b>deep</b> or <b>surface</b> learning were evaluated using the revised two-factor Study Process Questionnaire. Secondly, after completion of an assessment exercise comprising a multimedia presentation with digital images and oral commentary, the respondents&# 039; self-described approaches to learning were collected using semi-structured interviews. Using these two data sets, learners preferred and implemented learning approaches were compared. Results show that whilst the multimedia assessment exercise did not prohibit the adoption of a deep learning approach, it tended to enable the adoption of both <b>deep</b> and <b>surface</b> learning approaches. In addition to informing our understanding of the relationship between <b>deep</b> and <b>surface</b> learning preferences and the implementation of a multimedia assessment item, the data gathered also provide some clues related to the sorts of factors that the respondents considered and how they responded to these factors in their undertaking of the assessment exercise...|$|R
