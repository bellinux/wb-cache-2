5|$|As Minton grew older, he was {{frequently}} {{in trouble with}} the people in his neighborhood. In 1904, he was arrested for disregarding a town ordinance forbidding bicyclists to ride on the sidewalk. He was taken before a justice of the peace and fined three <b>dollars,</b> <b>an</b> incident he later credited with changing his outlook on life and sparking his desire to become a lawyer. To accomplish that goal, and continue supporting his family, he traveled with his older brother Herbert to Fort Worth, Texas, to take a job at the Swift and Company meat packing plant. His father and younger siblings soon joined him in Texas after the two brothers' income was able to cover their expenses. After saving enough money to help establish the family in a new home, Minton returned to Indiana to attend high school, leaving his family in Texas.|$|E

25|$|Dwarfing {{the other}} cities in the antebellum South, New Orleans had the nation's largest slave market. The market {{expanded}} after the U.S. ended the international trade in 1808. Two-thirds {{of the more than}} one million slaves brought to the Deep South arrived via forced migration in the domestic slave trade. The money generated by the sale of slaves in the Upper South has been estimated at 15 percent {{of the value of the}} staple crop economy. The slaves were collectively valued at half a billion <b>dollars.</b> <b>An</b> ancillary economy grew up around the trade—for transportation, housing and clothing, fees, etc., estimated at 13.5 percent of the price per person, amounting to tens of billions of dollars (2005 dollars, adjusted for inflation) during the antebellum period, with New Orleans as a prime beneficiary.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} Reagan's 1981 tax cuts (reduced revenue {{relative}} to a baseline without the cuts) were at least partially offset by phased in Social Security payroll tax increases that had been enacted by President Jimmy Carter and the 95th Congress in 1977, and further increases by Reagan in 1983 An accounting indicated nominal tax receipts increased from $599 billion in 1981 to $1.032 trillion in 1990, an increase of 72% in current dollars. In 2005 dollars, the tax receipts in 1990 were $1.5 trillion, an increase of 20% above inflation. From 1991 to 2000, receipts increased by 90% in current dollars, or 60% in 2005 <b>dollars.</b> <b>An</b> analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities calculated that the average annual growth rate of real income-tax receipts per working-age person eventually rose over the two decades from 0.2% (1981–90) to 3.1% (1990–2001).|$|E
500|$|The {{day after}} the eruption, relief workers were appalled at its impact. The lahars had left behind a gray mass which covered the entire town. Armero was dotted with broken trees and horribly {{disfigured}} human bodies. Debris from huts and homes protruded from beneath the gray mud. A few bags filled with crops were discovered in the mud. Workers described an acrid smell of [...] "rotting bodies, wood smoke and decaying vegetables." [...] To the horror of these workers, who were scrambling to begin relief efforts, survivors let out moans of pain and agony. The damages were assessed at six billion <b>dollars,</b> <b>an</b> amount approximately one-fifth of Colombia's 1985 Gross National Product.|$|E

5000|$|The Civil War {{program was}} {{transformed}} into a system of old-age pensions for Union veterans.

2500|$|Pursuant to the 2009 {{management}} plan, FWP began considering {{new rules}} governing the Smith River Recreational Waterway in 2010. Two of these proved highly controversial.

Although the rule was designed to ensure more people enjoyed the river, {{members of the public}} said it was unfair to those who had to cancel. The second proposal would require anyone using the new Deep Creek boat camp to pack out their human waste. The agency was forced to extend the comment period from 30 to 45 days to accommodate the controversy these two proposals engendered. Far less controversial was the proposal to create a new [...] "super permit" [...] lottery. Under this scheme, members of the public would be able to purchase, for $5 ($ in [...] <b>dollars),</b> <b>an</b> unlimited number of chances to win a single permit to float any day they wanted during the float season.

2500|$|The Woodland Cemetery Foundation {{completed}} {{a major effort}} to recognize African American veterans at Woodland Cemetery in 2012.

On Memorial Day, the foundation hosted ceremonies to honor those who served {{in what was then}} known as the United States Colored Troops. The foundation also began assembling the paperwork to document the military service of these African Americans, so that the United States Department of Veterans Affairs would supply them with a free headstone. In mid-June 2011, the Woodland Cemetery Foundation announced that it had partnered with the Johns-Carabelli Company, a local funerary monument maker, to build a $5,000 ($ in [...] dollars) monument to all U.S. Colored Troops buried at Woodland Cemetery.
