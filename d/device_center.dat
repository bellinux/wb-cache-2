25|$|Supporters modeled a nonthermal plasma. The {{justification}} is {{the high}} amount of scattering in the <b>device</b> <b>center.</b> Without a magnetic field, electrons scatter in this region. They claimed that this scattering leads to a monoenergetic distribution, like the one shown in Figure 6. This argument is supported by 2 dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Bussard argued that constant electron injection {{would have the same}} effect. Such a distribution would help maintain a negative voltage in the center, improving performance.|$|E
