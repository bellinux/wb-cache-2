50|$|More broadly, flight-to-quality {{refers to}} a sudden shift in {{investment}} behaviors {{in a period of}} financial turmoil whereby investors seek to sell assets perceived as risky and instead purchase safe assets. A defining feature of flight-to-quality is insufficient risk-taking by investors. While excessive risk-taking can be a source of financial turmoil, insufficient risk-taking can severely disrupt credit and other financial markets during a financial turmoil. Such a portfolio shift <b>further</b> <b>exposes</b> the financial sector to negative shocks. An increase in leverage and credit spread on all but the safest and most liquid assets may incur a sudden dry up in risky asset markets, which may lead to real effects on the economy.|$|E

5000|$|Fibronectin plays {{a crucial}} role in wound healing. [...] Along with fibrin, plasma {{fibronectin}} is deposited at the site of injury, forming a blood clot that stops bleeding and protects the underlying tissue. As repair of the injured tissue continues, fibroblasts and macrophages begin to remodel the area, degrading the proteins that form the provisional blood clot matrix and replacing them with a matrix that more resembles the normal, surrounding tissue. Fibroblasts secrete proteases, including matrix metalloproteinases, that digest the plasma fibronectin, and then the fibroblasts secrete cellular fibronectin and assemble it into an insoluble matrix. Fragmentation of fibronectin by proteases has been suggested to promote wound contraction, a critical step in wound healing. Fragmenting fibronectin <b>further</b> <b>exposes</b> its V-region, which contains the site for α4β1 integrin binding. These fragments of fibronectin are believed to enhance the binding of α4β1 integrin-expressing cells, allowing them to adhere to and forcefully contract the surrounding matrix.|$|E

40|$|Open Access JournalDried cassava {{products}} {{are perceived as}} one of the potential sources of mycotoxin ingestion in human foods. Processing either contributes to the reduction of toxins or <b>further</b> <b>exposes</b> products to contamination by microorganisms that release metabolic toxins into the products. Thus, the prevalence of microbial metabolites in 373 processed cassava products was investigated in Nigeria. With the use of liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for the constituent analysis, a few major mycotoxins (aflatoxin B 1 and G 1, fumonisin B 1 and B 2, and zearalenone) regulated in food crops by the Commission of the European Union were found at concentrations which are toxicologically acceptable in many other crops. Some bioactive compounds were detected at low concentrations in the cassava products. Therefore, the exposure of cassava consumers in Nigeria to regulated mycotoxins was estimated to be minimal.

40|$|Based on neutron powder {{diffraction}} (NPD) {{and high}} angle annular dark field scanning {{transmission electron microscopy}} (HAADF-STEM), we show that calcium ions help eliminate the Fe-antisite defects by controlling the nucleation and evolution of the LiFePO 2 ̆ 084 particles during their hydrothermal synthesis. This Ca-regulated formation of LiFePO 2 ̆ 084 particles has an overwhelming impact on the removal of their iron antisite defects during the subsequent carbon-coating step since (i) almost all the Fe-antisite defects aggregate at the surface of the LiFePO 2 ̆ 084 crystal when the crystals are small enough and (ii) the concomitant increase of the surface area, which <b>further</b> <b>exposes</b> the Fe-antisite defects.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} {{embodiment}} from a cross-disciplinary perspective. The notion that embodiment {{is an essential}} requirement for conscious awareness is explored using both a scientific and religious approach. Artificial intelligence, transhumanism and cybernetics are discussed as they force a pragmatic approach to defining and understanding situated embodiment. The concept of human immortality or extended longevity is also investigated as this <b>further</b> <b>exposes</b> the myths of transcending corporeality and also helps to explain the mission of transhumanism. This paper is concerned with how we existing humans might either live in our present bodies for greatly extended life spans, or how we might copy ourselves to a medium more suitable than our present biological bodies to increase longevity. Any discussion regarding the possibility of augmenting or transcending our existing biological bodies must include the apparent non-physical aspects of embodiment—consciousness, self, mind and psyche. It is my contention that disembodied consciousness is an impossibility. This argument necessarily requires a discussion which includes scientific concepts and various religious and spiritual systems.

40|$|Congestion control {{algorithm}} in Vehicular Networks (VANETs) {{has been extensively}} studied. However, most of congestion {{control algorithm}}s are not directly applicable to uni-priority of event-driven safety messages. The event-driven safety messages have stringent requirement on delay and reliability. The unipriority of event-driven safety messages are caused by the traffic of the same priority, typically the warning messages of safety applications from different transmitters. The uni-priority messages should be schedule before the node starts the transmitting process. In dense network, {{a large number of}} vehicles broadcast a beacon messages at a high number of frequency. Then the Control Channel (CCH) easily congested. It’s very important to keep the CCH channel free from congestion to ensure timely and reliable delivery of event-driven safety messages [9, 20]. Hence, this study takes a closer look at existing congestion control algorithms to solve congestion problems because it affects the performance of safety messages. The study <b>further</b> <b>exposes</b> the weaknesses and advantages of some of these congestion control algorithms which can assist researchers to tackle the inherent problems of congestions in VANETs.

40|$|Packet loss in Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) {{is due to}} {{congestion}} and probably due to high bit error rate caused by interference, link and node failures. Presently, congestion control and routing protocols in WMNs are not seen to have tamed this recurrent problem of congestion being experience most times in the wireless network. Routing techniques {{may lead to a}} co ngestive scenario and the congestion control should detect and probably avoid such situations. The way in which the congestion is handled may results in longer delay and more packet loss and a very significant overhead may also be incurred. Hence, this study takes a closer look at existing solutions with the application of clustering techniques to solve routing and congestion control problems because it offers scalability and reduced overheads. The study <b>further</b> <b>exposes</b> the weakness and added advantages of some of these cluster based solutions which can assist researchers to come up with broader approach to tackle the inherent problems of congestions and load balancing in an ad hoc network like WMNs.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to advance}} {{understanding}} of the disciplinary decision-making process underpinning the professional ethics machinery employed by professional accounting organisations, using elements of francophone organisational analysis to examine {{the influence of the}} key formal organisational components established by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland (ICAI) to administer its disciplinary decision-making process up to December 1999.
