30|$|Despite the {{straightforward}} {{formulation of}} the problem, there are several specific features of AEC, which represent a challenge for any adaptive algorithm. First, the acoustic <b>echo</b> <b>paths</b> have excessive lengths in time (up to hundreds of milliseconds), due to the slow speed of sound in the air, together with multiple reflections caused by the environment; consequently, long length adaptive filters are required (hundreds or even thousands of coefficients), thus influencing the convergence rate of the algorithm. Also, the acoustic <b>echo</b> <b>paths</b> are time-variant systems, depending on temperature, pressure, humidity, and movement of objects or bodies; hence, good tracking capabilities are required for the echo canceller. Second, the echo signal is combined with the near-end signal; ideally, the adaptive filter should separate this mixture and provide {{an estimate of the}} echo at its output and an estimate of the near-end from the error signal (from this point of view, the adaptive filter works as in an “interference cancelling” configuration [10 – 12]). This is not an easy task, since the near-end signal can contain both the background noise and the near-end speech; the background noise can be non-stationary and strong (it is also amplified by the microphone of the hands-free device), while the near-end speech acts like a large level disturbance. Moreover, the input of the adaptive filter (i.e., the far-end signal) is mainly speech, which is a non-stationary and highly correlated signal that can influence the overall performance of the adaptive algorithm.|$|R

This {{particular}} problem has been addressed by several authors earlier [16 – 18]. The problem of changes in the true echo paths causes the estimated <b>echo</b> <b>path</b> to be different from the current <b>echo</b> <b>path.</b> The altering position of the belt microphones is modeled here as a change in the <b>echo</b> <b>path.</b> A change in the system distance can be caused by other factors like a adjusting the volume of the playback of the reference signal, or delay change of the entire system could also lead to an increase in the system distance. Such behaviors are called “echo path change” or “room change” in the literature [19, 20]. Several algorithms are suggested for detecting <b>echo</b> <b>path</b> changes mostly in combination with double-talk detection methods [21, 22]. The approach proposed in [22] is based on correlation techniques in the time-domain, whereas in [21], a subband-based solution with two filters is presented.

Many practical systems combine an AEC and an AES in a sequential way such that the former achieves major echo cancellation, and the latter attenuates the residual echoes.
