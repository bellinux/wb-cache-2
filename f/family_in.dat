40|$|PURPOSE: To {{identify}} contextual {{and interpersonal}} factors that distinguish <b>families</b> <b>in</b> which the intergenerational transmission of maltreatment is maintained from <b>families</b> <b>in</b> which the cycle is broken. METHODS: The sample {{was composed of}} 1, 116 <b>families</b> <b>in</b> the United Kingdom {{who participated in the}} Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study. We assessed mother's childhood history of maltreatment retrospectively with a validated and reliable interview. Prospective reports of children's physical maltreatment were collected repeatedly up to 12 years. We compared <b>families</b> <b>in</b> which mothers but not children had experienced maltreatment with <b>families</b> <b>in</b> which both mothers and children had experienced maltreatment, and with families without maltreatment, on a range of contextual and interpersonal factors known to affect child development. RESULTS: In multivariate analyses, supportive and trusting relationships with intimate partners, high levels of maternal warmth toward children, and low levels of partner violence between adults distinguished <b>families</b> <b>in</b> which mothers but not children experienced maltreatment from <b>families</b> <b>in</b> which mothers and children experienced maltreatment. <b>Families</b> <b>in</b> which only mothers experienced maltreatment were largely similar to <b>families</b> <b>in</b> which neither generation experienced maltreatment, except that mothers belonging to the former group {{were more likely to have}} a lifetime history of depression and low levels of social support. CONCLUSIONS: Safe, stable, nurturing relationships between intimate partners and between mothers and children are associated with breaking the cycle of abuse <b>in</b> <b>families.</b> Additional research is needed to determine whether these factors have a causal role in preventing the transmission of maltreatment from one generation to the next...|$|R

40|$|Survey {{data from}} a USDA-funded multi-state {{longitudinal}} project revealed a paradox where rural low-income families from states considered prosperous were persistently more food insecure than similar families from less prosperous states. An examination of quantitative and qualitative data found that <b>families</b> <b>in</b> the food insecure states {{were more likely to}} experience greater material hardship and incur greater housing costs than <b>families</b> <b>in</b> the food secure states. <b>Families</b> <b>in</b> the food insecure states, however, did not have lower per capita median incomes or lower life satisfaction than those in the food secure states. A wide range of strategies to cope with food insecurity reported by <b>families</b> <b>in</b> both food insecure and food secure states was examined using the Family Ecological Systems Theory. <b>Families</b> <b>in</b> the food insecure states used several risky consumption reduction strategies such as curbing their appetite and using triage. <b>Families</b> <b>in</b> the food secure states, on the other hand, employed positive techniques involving their human capital. persistent food insecurity, rural low-income families, food coping strategies, Family Ecological systems, material hardship...|$|R
