5|$|In 2003, Affeldt {{found himself}} {{competing}} with Runelvys Hernández {{for the first}} spot in the Royals' starting rotation during Spring training. Because Tony Peña, the Royals' manager, was unable to decide which one would be the ace, <b>he</b> <b>flipped</b> a coin to determine who would be number one. Hernández won the toss.|$|E
5|$|The fifth contest was a Full Metal Mayhem {{match for}} a future match on Impact! for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Early in the match, Abyss placed two tables {{side-by-side}} and then stacked two more on top of those at ringside. Mid-way through the match, Hardy grabbed Abyss and placed him on a table {{at the top of}} the entrance ramp, he then ascended to the roof of the entrance ramp and performed a front-flip, landing on Abyss in a move Hardy calls the Swanton Bomb. In the final minutes of the match, Hardy climbed a ladder and retrieved one of the envelopes, however, it was empty which meant the last one held the future championship match. Hardy then tried to move the ladder and retrieve the second envelope. While he was climbing again, Abyss grabbed him and pulled him down, he then threw Hardy against the ropes. When Hardy connected with the ropes, <b>he</b> <b>flipped</b> over them and crashed through the four tables set up earlier in the match. Abyss followed by climbing the ladder and removing the envelope to win the match.|$|E
5|$|During the 1997 season, Webber was {{approached}} by Mercedes-AMG to compete in sportscar racing. Although he initially declined the offer he was persuaded {{at the end of}} the year when invited to participate in a test session for the team at the A1-Ring in Austria. Mercedes-AMG were suitably impressed with Webber, and he was signed as the official Mercedes works junior driver for the 1998 FIA GT Championship, alongside reigning champion Bernd Schneider. Travelling around the world, including the United States, Japan and Europe, the pair won five of the ten rounds on their way to second in the overall standings, beaten to the Championship by teammates Klaus Ludwig and Ricardo Zonta by just eight seconds in the final race at Laguna Seca. Webber remained with the Mercedes-AMG team for 1999, and was promoted to his own race car for the season. However, his sportscar career came to an early end after <b>he</b> <b>flipped</b> twice on the Mulsanne Straight during practice for the 1999 24 Hours of Le Mans race. An aerodynamic fault on the team's Mercedes-Benz CLRs caused Webber to become spectacularly airborne during both practice and race-day warm up, with the same fate befalling teammate Peter Dumbreck five hours into the race. Both drivers escaped uninjured, but the crashes forced Mercedes to shelve their sportscar program for the year and Webber to reconsider a return to open wheel racing.|$|E

5|$|Schneider started Vancouver's {{next game}} against the Calgary Flames. For the second-straight game, Vancouver lost a two-goal lead in a game which {{eventually}} went to a shootout. In contrast to his first start, Schneider had a strong game, making 34 saves {{by the end of}} overtime. In the shootout, he stopped four of the five shooters he faced, earning the Canucks their first win of the season. Two nights later, as they began their first road trip, the Canucks played a rematch with the Ducks in Anaheim. Schneider made the start and earned some redemption, stopping all 30 Anaheim shots, helping the Canucks to the 5–0 win and earning his fifth career shutout. Following the win, Schneider started the next game, a 4–1 loss to the San Jose Sharks. Luongo started the next four games, finishing off the month of January and beginning February. Vigneault joked that he was making his starting goaltender decisions based on coin tosses. He further noted that the two goaltenders were team guys and they would do what was asked of them and never complain. The coin became a running joke for Vigneault and the Canucks in general, as Ryan Kesler stated <b>he</b> <b>flipped</b> it before announcing his return from injury.|$|E

50|$|Following this incident, {{the coin}} toss rules were changed. Now, instead of calling the toss while the coin {{is in the}} air, the team captain chooses heads or tails before the coin is flipped and the referee {{confirms}} the selection before <b>he</b> <b>flips</b> the coin.|$|R

During the 1982 season, Earnhardt struggled. Although he won at Darlington, {{he failed to}} finish 15 races and completed the season 12th in points, the worst of his career. He also suffered a broken kneecap at Pocono Raceway when <b>he</b> <b>flipped</b> after contact with Tim Richmond. In 1983, Earnhardt rebounded and won his first of 12 Twin 125 Daytona 500 qualifying races. He won at Nashville and at Talladega, finishing eighth in the points standings.|$|E

MMA Weekly reported that Nick Diaz signed a two-year deal with EliteXC {{and in his}} next fight, fought striking specialist KJ Noons for the vacant 160 pound title. Once the fight began, the two exchanged rather evenly on the feet until Noons dropped Diaz with a well timed right counterpunch. Diaz attempted several takedowns, {{all of which were}} stuffed by Noons, on one occasion with a swift right knee which opened up a notable gash on Diaz's face, eventually resulting in a loss via doctor stoppage due to multiple cuts on his forehead. A disappointed Diaz left the arena immediately and on his way out <b>he</b> <b>flipped</b> off the doctor from the arena entrance and shoved the camera out of his face.|$|E

500|$|Privately, Rindt {{was known}} {{to family and friends}} as an often {{reckless}} driver when on public roads. During the early years of his career, he took his Jaguar E-Type out in the streets of Vienna, where he lived, and drifted through the streets.

500|$|Brain {{graduated}} {{at the top}} of {{his class}} after the year-long training course at Point Cook, and was duly commissioned in the CAF. Moving to Queensland in April 1924, he took up employment as a pilot with Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services (Qantas), its first aviator without a war record. On 7February 1925, he flew the first scheduled passenger service from Cloncurry to Camooweal, extending the airline's founding [...] route—from Charleville to Cloncurry—by [...] The following year, he completed a refresher course at Central Flying School, Point Cook. On a rain-soaked McKinlay airfield near Cloncurry on 27February 1927, <b>he</b> <b>flipped</b> Qantas' first de Havilland DH.50 on to its back while attempting take-off, though he managed to escape without injury. Qantas founder Hudson Fysh berated him for a [...] "serious error of judgement", but noted his excellent three-year record as a pilot; the aircraft was soon repaired and operational again. [...] The next month, Brain became Chief Instructor at the Qantas Flying School in Brisbane, doubling as manager of the airline's local office. By mid-1928, he had overworked himself to the extent that he was ordered to take respite by Fysh; this [...] "respite" [...] nevertheless involved a 13-week trip to England to study aviation developments.|$|E
2500|$|After the First World War, Germans in America {{sought to}} regain their {{political}} influence, and they succeeded. Both Valentin Peter, editor of the Omaha Tribüne, and the National German-American Alliance gained enough political clout to influence United States presidential campaigns. In 1920, immediately after the 1920 United States presidential election in November, Peter came under scrutiny by the United States Senate, and was called to testify on {{his involvement in the}} campaign. According to Peter's testimony, <b>he</b> <b>flipped</b> to supporting Calvin Coolidge in exchange for $12,500. Later, during the 1928 presidential election, the Democratic National Committee enlisted Peter to join to show the support of German-Americans for Al Smith.

2500|$|Knievel set most jump records {{using the}} XR-750, but since 2008, most jump records {{are held by}} stunt {{performer}} Bubba Blackwell. [...] Currently, the longest jump on the XR-750 by Bubba Blackwell was successfully made in 1999, when he jumped 15 buses at 157 feet. On August 6, 2015 the daredevil stunt performer Doug Danger [...] at the Sturgis Bike Rally at the Buffalo Chip, broke Knievel's record for most cars jumped on a XR-750 with 22 cars. [...] Knievel attempted this feat of 22 cars in Monroe, Washington on September 1, 1972 and cleared 21 cars but landed on the safety deck covering the 22nd car. Bubba Blackwell attempted the same 22-car jump In 2001 with horrible consequences. <b>He</b> <b>flipped</b> end-over-end when he missed the landing, nearly died and {{was in a coma}} for months.

2500|$|He also {{invented the}} {{inverted}} BMX racing bicycle stem (also {{known as a}} [...] "gooseneck"). Unlike the standard [...] "quill gooseneck" [...] stem, BMX bicycles {{in need of a}} stem with a much tighter clamping force on the bars to eliminate movement forward or back. That could be caused by the more violent physical abuse racers put upon it like pulling with maximum force during racing and jumping their bicycles, these stems were four-point block clamps secured with Allen bolts, unlike the single point quill gooseneck that had a single [...] "pinchbolt" [...] configuration to clamp the bars. Most other stems of this type, like the standard gooseneck, raised the bottom level of the handlebars up, the inverted stem dropped them down. Breithaupt was heading to an NBA National in Las Vegas, Nevada in 1979 to race cruiser class a new division in BMX that at the time was made up of BMX bicycles (during this time most were converted Beach Cruisers with 26" [...] diameter wheels, built for the larger rider as opposed the standard 20" [...] vehicle). As he was fitting his handle bars onto the stem of the bicycle he noticed that it was to high for his liking and presumably it couldn't be lowered far enough down to get the feel and leverage he desired. he then removed the clamp the part that actually held fast to the handlebars, from the stem, that was inserted into the head tube and into the fork's neck. <b>He</b> <b>flipped</b> it over and reattached it. He was able then to drop the bottom of the bars another few millimeters to his liking. He later won his Cruiser class at this national using that configuration. He would then persuade [...] "Tuff Neck", a leading manufacturer of BMX bicycle parts at the time, to mass-produce the new component.|$|E
