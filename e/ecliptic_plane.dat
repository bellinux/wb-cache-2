5|$|Most {{asteroid}}s {{within the}} asteroid belt have orbital eccentricities of less than 0.4, and an inclination of less than 30°. The orbital distribution of the asteroids reaches a maximum at an eccentricity of around 0.07 and an inclination below 4°. Thus although a typical asteroid has a relatively circular orbit and lies near {{the plane of the}} ecliptic, some asteroid orbits can be highly eccentric or travel well outside the <b>ecliptic</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|E
5|$|Eris (68AU average) is {{the largest}} known {{scattered}} disc object, and caused a debate about what constitutes a planet, because it is 25% more massive than Pluto and about the same diameter. It is the most massive of the known dwarf planets. It has one known moon, Dysnomia. Like Pluto, its orbit is highly eccentric, with a perihelion of 38.2 AU (roughly Pluto's distance from the Sun) and an aphelion of 97.6 AU, and steeply inclined to the <b>ecliptic</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|E
5|$|The dwarf planet Pluto (39AU average) is {{the largest}} known object in the Kuiper belt. When {{discovered}} in 1930, it {{was considered to be}} the ninth planet; this changed in 2006 with the adoption of a formal definition of planet. Pluto has a relatively eccentric orbit inclined 17 degrees to the <b>ecliptic</b> <b>plane</b> and ranging from 29.7AU from the Sun at perihelion (within the orbit of Neptune) to 49.5AU at aphelion. Pluto has a 3:2 resonance with Neptune, meaning that Pluto orbits twice round the Sun for every three Neptunian orbits. Kuiper belt objects whose orbits share this resonance are called plutinos.|$|E
50|$|For latitudes {{north of}} the Arctic Circle (or south of the Antarctic Circle), the Ascendant {{function}} has two discontinuity points, occurring at instants where the horizon and the <b>ecliptic</b> <b>planes</b> do not intersect. Between those instants the Ascendant's longitude actually decreases.|$|R

5000|$|The zodiac constellations of Mars's {{ecliptic}} {{are almost}} {{the same as those}} of Earth [...] - [...] after all, the two <b>ecliptic</b> <b>planes</b> only have a mutual inclination of 1.85° [...] - [...] but on Mars, the Sun spends 6 days in the constellation Cetus, leaving and re-entering Pisces as it does so, making a total of 14 zodiacal constellations. The equinoxes and solstices are different as well: for the northern hemisphere, vernal equinox is in Ophiuchus (compared to Pisces on Earth), summer solstice is at the border of Aquarius and Pisces, autumnal equinox is in Taurus, and winter solstice is in Virgo.|$|R
5|$|There are {{two main}} classes of comet: short-period comets (also called {{ecliptic}} comets) and long-period comets (also called nearly isotropic comets). Ecliptic comets have relatively small orbits, below 10AU, and follow the <b>ecliptic</b> <b>plane,</b> the same plane in which the planets lie. All long-period comets have very large orbits, {{on the order of}} thousands of AU, and appear from every direction in the sky. Oort noted that there was a peak in numbers of long-period comets with aphelia (their farthest distance from the Sun) of roughly 20,000AU, which suggested a reservoir at that distance with a spherical, isotropic distribution.|$|E
5|$|At its fullest extent (but {{excluding}} the scattered disc), including its outlying regions, the Kuiper belt stretches from roughly 30 to 55 AU. The {{main body of}} the belt is generally accepted to extend from the 2:3 mean-motion resonance (see below) at 39.5 AU to the 1:2 resonance at roughly 48 AU. The Kuiper belt is quite thick, with the main concentration extending as much as ten degrees outside the <b>ecliptic</b> <b>plane</b> and a more diffuse distribution of objects extending several times farther. Overall it more resembles a torus or doughnut than a belt. Its mean position is inclined to the ecliptic by 1.86 degrees.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the galactic}} tide, the main trigger for sending comets {{into the inner}} Solar System {{is thought to be}} {{interaction}} between the Sun's Oort cloud and the gravitational fields of nearby stars or giant molecular clouds. The orbit of the Sun through the plane of the Milky Way sometimes brings it in relatively close proximity to other stellar systems. For example, it is hypothesized that 70thousand years ago, perhaps Scholz's star passed through the outer Oort cloud (although its low mass and high relative velocity limited its effect). During the next 10million years the known star with the greatest possibility of perturbing the Oort cloud is Gliese 710. This process could also scatter Oort cloud objects out of the <b>ecliptic</b> <b>plane,</b> potentially also explaining its spherical distribution.|$|E

5000|$|The orbital {{inclination}} {{with respect to}} the <b>ecliptic</b> (orbital <b>plane</b> of Earth) of [...] is a moderate 10.739°. Hence its orbit is slightly tilted compared with that of Earth; if it were not tilted at all, the orbits would lie right on top of each other.|$|R

5|$|The Moon makes a {{complete}} orbit around Earth {{with respect to}} the fixed stars about once every 27.3days (its sidereal period). However, because Earth is moving in its orbit around the Sun at the same time, it takes slightly longer for the Moon to show the same phase to Earth, which is about 29.5days (its synodic period). Unlike most satellites of other planets, the Moon orbits closer to the <b>ecliptic</b> <b>plane</b> than to the planet's equatorial plane. The Moon's orbit is subtly perturbed by the Sun and Earth in many small, complex and interacting ways. For example, the plane of the Moon's orbit gradually rotates once every 18.61 years, which affects other aspects of lunar motion. These follow-on effects are mathematically described by Cassini's laws.|$|E
5|$|Because Earth's {{rotational}} axis is not perpendicular to its orbital plane, Earth's equatorial plane is not coplanar with the <b>ecliptic</b> <b>plane,</b> but {{is inclined to}} it by an angle of about 23.4°, which {{is known as the}} obliquity of the ecliptic. If the equator is projected outward to the celestial sphere, forming the celestial equator, it crosses the ecliptic at two points known as the equinoxes. The Sun, in its apparent motion along the ecliptic, crosses the celestial equator at these points, one from south to north, the other from north to south. The crossing from south to north is known as the vernal equinox, also known as the first point of Aries and the ascending node of the ecliptic on the celestial equator. The crossing from north to south is the autumnal equinox or descending node.|$|E
5|$|On February 8, 1992, the Ulysses solar probe flew past Jupiter's {{north pole}} at a {{distance}} of 451,000km. This swing-by maneuver was required for Ulysses to attain a very high-inclination orbit around the Sun, increasing its inclination to the ecliptic to 80.2 degrees. The giant planet's gravity bent the spacecraft's flightpath downward and away from the <b>ecliptic</b> <b>plane,</b> placing it into a final orbit around the Sun's north and south poles. The size and shape of the probe's orbit were adjusted to a much smaller degree, so that its aphelion remained at approximately 5AU (Jupiter's distance from the Sun), while its perihelion lay somewhat beyond 1AU (Earth's distance from the Sun). During its Jupiter encounter, the probe made measurements of the planet's magnetosphere. Since the probe had no cameras, no images were taken. In February 2004, the probe arrived again at the vicinity of Jupiter. This time the distance from the planet was much greater—about 240 million km—but it made further observations of Jupiter.|$|E
50|$|Astronomically, {{the zodiac}} defines a belt of space {{extending}} 9° {{either side of}} the ecliptic, within which the orbits of the Moon and the principal planets remain. It is a feature of a celestial coordinate system centered upon the <b>ecliptic,</b> (the <b>plane</b> of the Earth's orbit and the Sun's apparent path), by which celestial longitude is measured in degrees east of the vernal equinox (the ascending intersection of the ecliptic and equator).|$|R
50|$|The astrological {{ephemeris}} {{was developed}} {{for the purposes of}} setting up a birth chart, or horoscope, and converts positions of planets given in right ascension/declination into zodiacal longitude. This is a planet’s position along the <b>ecliptic</b> -the <b>plane</b> of the earth’s orbit around the sun, or the sun’s apparent path around a fixed, stationary earth. An astrological birth chart is geocentric, or earth-centred, calculated as if the earth was at a fixed point, with the zodiac ‘revolving’ around it.|$|R

5|$|If the Moon {{were in a}} {{perfectly}} circular orbit, {{a little closer to}} the Earth, and in the same orbital plane, there would be total solar eclipses every new moon. However, since the Moon's orbit is tilted at more than 5 degrees to the Earth's orbit around the Sun, its shadow usually misses Earth. The Moon's orbit must cross Earth's <b>ecliptic</b> <b>plane</b> in order for an eclipse (both solar as well as lunar) to occur. In addition, the Moon's actual orbit is elliptical, often taking it far enough away from Earth that its apparent size is not large enough to block the Sun entirely. The orbital planes cross each other at a line of nodes resulting in at least two, and up to five, solar eclipses occurring each year; no more than two of which can be total eclipses. However, total solar eclipses are rare at any particular location because totality exists only along a narrow path on the Earth's surface traced by the Moon's shadow or umbra.|$|E
25|$|The three unit vectors of {{the torque}} {{at the center}} of the Earth (top to bottom) are x on a line within the <b>ecliptic</b> <b>plane</b> (the {{intersection}} of Earth's equatorial plane with the <b>ecliptic</b> <b>plane)</b> directed toward the vernal equinox, y on a line in the <b>ecliptic</b> <b>plane</b> directed toward the summer solstice (90° east of x), and z on a line directed toward the north pole of the ecliptic.|$|E
25|$|Earth's {{orbital plane}} {{is known as}} the <b>ecliptic</b> <b>plane,</b> and Earth's tilt is known to astronomers as the {{obliquity}} of the ecliptic, being the angle between the ecliptic and the celestial equator on the celestial sphere. It is denoted by the Greek letter ε.|$|E
50|$|The {{inclination}} {{is one of}} the six orbital elements {{describing the}} shape and orientation of a celestial orbit. It is the angle between the orbital plane and the plane of reference, normally stated in degrees. For a satellite orbiting a planet, the plane of reference is usually the plane containing the planet's equator. For planets in the Solar System, the plane of reference is usually the <b>ecliptic,</b> the <b>plane</b> in which the Earth orbits the Sun. This reference plane is most practical for Earth-based observers. Therefore, Earth's inclination is, by definition, zero.|$|R
5000|$|The {{latitude}} of {{the polar}} circles is 90 degrees minus the axial tilt of the Earth's axis of daily rotation relative to the <b>ecliptic,</b> the <b>plane</b> of the Earth's orbit. This tilt varies slightly, a phenomenon described as nutation. Therefore, the latitudes noted above are calculated by averaging values of tilt observed over many years. The axial tilt also exhibits long-term variations {{as described in the}} reference article (a difference of 1 second of arc in the tilt is equivalent to change of about 31 metres north or south in the positions {{of the polar}} circles on the Earth's surface).|$|R

25|$|Until Ulysses, the Sun {{was only}} {{observed}} from low solar latitudes. The Earth's orbit defines the <b>ecliptic</b> <b>plane,</b> which {{differs from the}} Sun's equatorial plane by only 7.25 degrees. Even spacecraft directly orbiting the Sun do so in planes close to the ecliptic because a direct launch into a high-inclination solar orbit would require a prohibitively large launch vehicle.|$|E
25|$|It {{arrived at}} Jupiter on 8 February 1992 for a {{swing-by}} maneuver that increased its inclination to the ecliptic by 80.2 degrees. The giant planet's gravity bent the spacecraft's flight path southward {{and away from}} the <b>ecliptic</b> <b>plane.</b> This put it into a final orbit around the Sun that would take it past the Sun's north and south poles.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to lunisolar precession, {{the actions of}} the other planets of the Solar System cause the whole ecliptic to rotate slowly around an axis which has an ecliptic longitude of about 174° measured on the instantaneous ecliptic. This so-called planetary precession shift amounts to a rotation of the <b>ecliptic</b> <b>plane</b> of 0.47 seconds of arc per year (more than a hundred times smaller than lunisolar precession). The sum of the two precessions is known as the general precession.|$|E
40|$|The current nebular theory postulates that planets are. a {{consequence}} of the formation of stars from viscous accretion disks. Condensation from the accretion disk favors the formation of small rocky planets in the hot inner region, and the formation of gas giants in the cool outer region. Consequently, terrestrial-type planet in inner orbits should be commonplace. From geometrical considerations, Borucki and Summers have shown that 1 % of planetary systems resembling our solar system should show transits for Earth-sized (or larger) planets. Thus a photometric satellite that uses a wide field of view telescope and a large detector array to simultaneously monitor 5000 target stars should detect 50 planetary systems. To differentiate regularly recurring transits from statistical fluctuations of the stellar flux, one must observe over several orbital periods so that the false positive rate can be reduced to one event or less. A one-meter aperture telescope placed in a halo orbit about either the L 1 or L 2 Lagrange points and viewing perpendicular to both the orbital and <b>ecliptic</b> <b>planes</b> can view continuously for the required period because neither the Sun, Earth, or Moon would enter the field of view. Model calculations show that the observations should provide statistically significant estimates of the distributions of planetary size, orbital radius, coplanarity, and the frequency of planetary systems that have Earth-sized planets in inner orbits. Because approximately one half of the star systems observed will be binary systems, the frequency of planetary systems orbiting either {{one or both of the}} stars can also be determined...|$|R
50|$|For nearby stars astronomers use heliocentric coordinates, {{with the}} center of the Sun as the origin. The {{reference}} plane can either be aligned with the Earth's equator, the <b>plane</b> of the <b>ecliptic</b> or the <b>plane</b> of the Milky Way galaxy. The distances involved are so great compared to the relative velocities of the stars that for most purposes the time component can be neglected.|$|R
50|$|The Galactic {{plane is}} {{inclined}} by about 60 {{degrees to the}} <b>ecliptic</b> (the <b>plane</b> of Earth's orbit). Relative to the celestial equator, it passes {{as far north as}} the constellation of Cassiopeia and as far south as the constellation of Crux, indicating the high inclination of Earth’s equatorial plane and the <b>plane</b> of the <b>ecliptic,</b> relative to the Galactic plane. The north Galactic pole is situated at right ascension 12h 49m, declination +27.4° (B1950) near β Comae Berenices, and the south Galactic pole is near α Sculptoris. Because of this high inclination, depending on the time of night and year, the arc of the Milky Way may appear relatively low or relatively high in the sky. For observers from approximately 65 degrees north to 65 degrees south on Earth's surface, the Milky Way passes directly overhead twice a day.|$|R
25|$|The IMF {{originates}} on the Sun, {{linked to}} the sunspots, and its field lines (lines of force) are dragged out by the solar wind. That alone would tend to line {{them up in the}} Sun-Earth direction, but the rotation of the Sun angles them at Earth by about 45 degrees forming a spiral in the <b>ecliptic</b> <b>plane),</b> known as the Parker spiral. The field lines passing Earth are therefore usually linked to those near the western edge ("limb") of the visible Sun at any time.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the lunar}} orbit is also {{inclined}} to Earth's <b>ecliptic</b> <b>plane</b> by 5.1°, the rotational {{axis of the}} Moon seems to rotate {{towards and away from}} Earth during one complete orbit. This is referred to as latitudinal libration, which allows one to see almost 7° of latitude beyond the pole on the far side. Finally, because the Moon is only about 60 Earth radii away from Earth's centre of mass, an observer at the equator who observes the Moon throughout the night moves laterally by one Earth diameter. This gives rise to a diurnal libration, which allows one to view an additional one degree's worth of lunar longitude. For the same reason, observers at both of Earth's geographical poles would be able to see one additional degree's worth of libration in latitude.|$|E
25|$|The mean {{inclination}} of {{the lunar}} orbit to the <b>ecliptic</b> <b>plane</b> is 5.145°. The rotational axis of the Moon is also not perpendicular to its orbital plane, so the lunar equator {{is not in the}} plane of its orbit, but is inclined to it by a constant value of 6.688° (this is the obliquity). This does not mean that, {{as a result of the}} precession of the Moon's orbital plane, the angle between the lunar equator and the ecliptic would vary between the sum (11.833°) and difference (1.543°) of these two angles, but, as was discovered by Jacques Cassini in 1722, the rotational axis of the Moon precesses with the same rate as its orbital plane, but is 180° out of phase (see Cassini's Laws). Therefore, the angle between the ecliptic and the lunar equator is always 1.543°, even though the rotational axis of the Moon is not fixed with respect to the stars.|$|E

500|$|Lowell's first search {{focused on}} the <b>ecliptic,</b> the <b>plane</b> {{encompassed}} by the zodiac where the other planets in the Solar System lie. Using a 5-inch photographic camera, he manually examined over 200 three-hour exposures with a magnifying glass, and found no planets. At that time Pluto was too far above the ecliptic to be imaged by the survey. [...] After revising his predicted possible locations, Lowell conducted a second search from 1914 to 1916. In 1915, he published his Memoir of a Trans-Neptunian Planet, in which he concluded that PlanetX had a mass roughly seven times that of Earth—about half that of Neptune—and a mean distance from the Sun of 43AU. He assumed PlanetX would be a large, low-density object with a high albedo, like the giant planets. As a result, it would show a disc with diameter of about one arcsecond and an apparent magnitude of between 12 and 13—bright enough to be spotted.|$|R
50|$|The Moon's maximum {{and minimum}} {{declination}} also vary because {{the plane of}} the Moon's orbit around the Earth is inclined by about 5.14° to the <b>ecliptic</b> (the <b>plane</b> of the Earth's orbit around the Sun), and the direction of lunar orbit inclination gradually changes over an 18.6-year cycle, alternately adding to or subtracting from the 23.5° tilt of the Earth's axis. As a consequence, the maximum declination of the Moon varies from roughly (23.5° − 5° =) 18.5° to (23.5° + 5° =) 28.5°. As a result, at minor lunar standstill, the Moon will change its declination during the nodal period from +18.5° to −18.5°, which is a total movement of 37°. Then, 9.3 years later, during the major lunar standstill, the Moon will change its declination during the nodal period from +28.5° to −28.5°, which is a total movement of 57°, which is enough to take its culmination from high in the sky to low on the horizon in just two weeks (half an orbit).|$|R
