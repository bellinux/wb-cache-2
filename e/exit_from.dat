5|$|After the 1963 season, {{the team}} fell apart. A roster filled with mostly older {{veterans}} plus some bad personnel moves (e.g. the dispatching of Rosey Grier, Sam Huff, and Don Chandler) {{lead to a}} quick <b>exit</b> <b>from</b> {{the top of the}} standings. The Giants finished 2–10–2 in 1964, beginning an 18-season playoff drought.|$|E

5|$|Diodorus {{says that}} the Egyptian fleet was sent to {{circumnavigate}} Salamis, and block the northern <b>exit</b> <b>from</b> the Straits. If Xerxes wanted to trap the Allies completely, this maneuver would have made sense (especially {{if he was not}} expecting the Allies to fight). However, Herodotus does not mention this (and possibly alludes to the Egyptian presence in the main battle), leading some modern historians to dismiss it; though again, others accept it as a possibility. Xerxes had also positioned around 400 troops on the island known as Psyttaleia, {{in the middle of the}} <b>exit</b> <b>from</b> the straits, in order to kill or capture any Greeks who ended up there (as a result of shipwreck or grounding).|$|E

5|$|Armed {{with the}} {{knowledge}} gained from their prisoners, Alvarado sent 40 men to cover the <b>exit</b> <b>from</b> the cave and launched another assault along the ravine from the west, in single file owing to its narrowness, with crossbowmen alternating with soldiers bearing muskets, each with a companion sheltering him from arrows and stones with a shield. This tactic allowed the Spanish {{to break through the}} pass and storm the entrance of the city. The Poqomam warriors fell back in disorder in a chaotic retreat through the city, and were hunted down by the victorious conquistadors and their Mesoamerican allies. Those who managed to retreat down the neighbouring valley were ambushed by Spanish cavalry who had been posted to block the <b>exit</b> <b>from</b> the cave, the survivors were captured and brought back to the city. The siege had lasted more than a month and because of the defensive strength of the city, Alvarado ordered it to be burned and moved the inhabitants to the new colonial village of Mixco.|$|E

His only real experience was military, but the manner of his <b>exit</b> <b>from</b> the British Army would make a return there awkward at best.|$|E
