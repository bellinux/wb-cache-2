40|$|Following {{the recent}} restart of {{operations}} at the Y- 12 Plant, the Radiological Control Organization (RCO) observed that the enriched uranium exposures appeared to involve insoluble rather than soluble uranium that presumably characterized most earlier Y- 12 operations. These observations necessitated changes in the bioassay program, particularly the need for routine fecal sampling. In addition, it was not reasonable to interpret the <b>bioassay</b> <b>data</b> using metabolic parameter values established during earlier Y- 12 operations. Thus, the recent urinary and fecal <b>bioassay</b> <b>data</b> were interpreted using the default guidance in Publication 54 of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP); that is, inhalation of Class Y uranium with an activity median aerodynamic diameter (AMAD) of 1 {micro}m. Faced with apparently new workplace conditions, these actions were appropriate and ensured a cautionary approach to worker protection. As additional <b>bioassay</b> <b>data</b> were accumulated, {{it became apparent that}} the data were not consistent with Publication 54.

40|$|The goal of {{internal}} dosimetry is {{to assess the}} dose to an individual from an intake of a radionuclide. This usually encompasses assessing the intake amount based on some form of bioassay measurement used with a biokinetic model. There are many published biokinetic models that describe the transfer of radionuclides throughout the body. It would be beneficial at times if one could interchange certain biokinetic models with another to assess an intake based on <b>bioassay</b> <b>data</b> to save time and make calculations simpler. This research compared the daily excretion rates by interchanging widely used biokinetic models in different combinations. These model combinations were then used to assess an unknown intake of a case study. It was shown that the ICRP- 30 and ICRP- 66 respiratory tract models can only be interchanged at specific times post intake to give similar excretion results from an inhalation intake. It is feasible to interchange the ICRP- 67 plutonium systemic model or the newer Luciani and Polig plutonium systemic model to assess an intake based on fecal <b>bioassay</b> <b>data,</b> but not urine <b>bioassay</b> <b>data</b> for ingestion intakes. It is not feasible to interchange the systemic models when assessing intakes from a wound or injection. Using different combinations of biokinetic models predicted intakes within 30 % for a case study which included a relatively long inhalation chronic intake followed by a much shorter chronic inhalation intake. It was shown that the predicted initial chronic intake for each combination of models gave fecal excretion values which deviated the most from the worker's fecal <b>bioassay</b> <b>data.</b> This could mean that the biokinetic models yield inaccurate excretion rates for long chronic intakes...|$|R

40|$|In vitro bioassays {{have been}} {{developed}} and are currently being evaluated as potential alternatives to traditional animal toxicity models. Already, the progress of high throughput screening techniques has resulted in {{an enormous amount of}} publicly available <b>bioassay</b> <b>data</b> having been generated for a large collection of compounds. When a compound is tested using a collection of various bioassays, all the testing results can be considered as providing a unique bio-profile for this compound, which records the responses induced when the compound interacts with different cellular systems or biological targets. Profiling compounds of environmental or pharmaceutical interest using useful toxicity <b>bioassay</b> <b>data</b> is a promising method to study complex animal toxicity. In this study, we developed an automatic virtual profiling tool to evaluate potential animal toxicants. First, we automatically acquired all PubChem <b>bioassay</b> <b>data</b> for a set of 4, 841 compounds with publicly available rat acute toxicity results. Next, we developed a scoring system to evaluate the relevance between these extracted bioassays and animal acute toxicity. Finally, the top ranked bioassays were selected to profile the compounds of interest. The resulting response profiles proved to be useful to prioritize untested compounds for their animal toxicity potentials and form a potential in vitro toxicity testing panel. The protocol developed in this study could be combined with structure-activity approaches and used to explore additional publicly available bioassay datasets for modeling a broader range of animal toxicities...|$|R
40|$|The first special {{volume of}} Limnology and Oceanography, {{published}} in 1972, focused on whether phosphorus (P) or carbon (C) {{is the major}} agent causing eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems. Only slight mention was made that estuaries may behave differently from lakes and that nitrogen (N) may cause eutrophication in estuaries. In the following decade, an understanding of eutrophication in estuaries proceeded in relative isolation from the community of scientists studying lakes. National water quality policy in the United States was directed almost solely toward P control for both lakes and estuaries, and similarly, European nations {{tended to focus on}} P control in lakes. Although <b>bioassay</b> <b>data</b> indicated N control of eutrophication in estuaries as early as the 1970 s, this body of knowledge was treated with skepticism by many freshwater scientists and water-quality managers, because <b>bioassay</b> <b>data</b> in lakes often did not properly indicate the importance of P relative to C in those ecosystems. Hence, the <b>bioassay</b> <b>data</b> in estuaries had little influence on water-quality management. Over the past two decades, a strong consensus has evolved among the scientific community that N is the primary cause of eutrophication in many coastal ecosystems. The development of this consensus was based in part on data from whole-ecosystem studies and on a growing body of evidence that presented convincing mechanistic reasons why the controls of eutrophication in lakes and coastal marine ecosystems may differ. Even though N is probably the major cause of eutrophication in most coastal system...|$|R

40|$|Dose– and time–mortality {{relationships}} of baculoviruses in pest insects {{are important for}} the determination of effective spraying regimes. A series of experiments with Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) and Spodoptera exigua MNPV (SeMNPV) against synchronized populations of S. exigua larvae in greenhouse chrysanthemum was conducted. Dose– and time–mortality {{relationships of}} different virus concentrations and S. exigua target stages were determined and the area foliage consumption was measured. Crop injury was greatly reduced when S. exigua were controlled as second or third instar larvae, whereas virus applications against fourth instar larvae could not prevent considerable crop injury, even at high concentrations. SeMNPV was approximately 10 times as infectious as AcMNPV when applied on greenhouse chrysanthemum. The relative virulence of AcMNPV and SeMNPV corresponded reasonably well with previously published laboratory <b>bioassay</b> <b>data.</b> SeMNPV killed second and fourth instar S. exigua larvae approximately 12 h faster than did AcMNPV in chrysanthemum, but no difference in speed of action was found for third instar larvae.

Based on animal data, regulatory strategy generally has been to postulate a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) for toxic effects and to divide this by a safety factor, usually 100, to establish acceptable levels for humans. Various authors have discussed the shortcomings of using NOEL and have suggested {{the use of an}} estimable effect level determined from a dose-response curve fitted to <b>bioassay</b> <b>data,</b> e. g., the dose at which 1 % of the animals are adversely affected, and employing some form of conservative low dose extrapolation to control risks at lower doses.

For the cost-sensitive classification, Weka's implementations of the Support Vector Machine and C 4. 5 decision tree learner have performed relatively well.
