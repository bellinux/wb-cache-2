5|$|Early in the film, Hoffman {{explains}} to his superiors that the terrorists' retreat to pre-tech age communication methods renders useless the high specification tools the CIA uses, {{and increases the}} worth of Ferris's human intelligence methods. They avoid mobile telephones and computers, preferring face-to-face communication and encoded written messages. By contrast, the Americans use sophisticated communication (Hoffman and Ferris regularly speak on the phone) and surveillance (high altitude spy planes offer a <b>different</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view throughout) technology.

25|$|The {{classification}} of text {{as belonging to}} the triple tradition (or for that matter, double tradition) is not always definitive, depending rather {{on the degree of}} similarity demanded. For example, Matthew and Mark report the cursing of the fig tree, clearly a single incident, despite some substantial differences of wording and content. Searching Luke, however, we find only the parable of the barren fig tree, in a <b>different</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the narrative. Some would say that Luke has extensively adapted an element of the triple tradition, while others would regard it as a distinct pericope.|$|E

This does not replace the striving to purify the heart, as in the other branch; it simply stems from a <b>different</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> entry into the path.

Many results known for smooth surfaces and their geodesics, such as Birkhoff's method of constructing geodesics by his curve-shortening process or van Mangoldt and Hadamard's theorem that a simply connected surface of non-positive curvature is homeomorphic to the plane, are equally valid in this more general setting.|$|E

500|$|From a <b>different</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, Demetrius Andreas M.-A. Floudas, of Hughes Hall, Cambridge, {{a leading}} {{commentator}} on the naming dispute from the Greek side, sums up this nationalistic reaction as follows: the Republic of Macedonia {{was accused of}} usurping the historical and cultural patrimony of Greece [...] "in order to furnish a nucleus of national self-esteem for the new state and provide its citizens with a new, distinct, non-Bulgarian, non-Serbian, non-Albanian identity". The Republic emerged thus to Greek eyes as {{a country with a}} personality crisis, [...] "a nondescript parasitic state" [...] that lived off the history of its neighbours, because it allegedly lacked an illustrious past of its own, for the sake of achieving cohesion for what Greeks regarded as an [...] "unhomogeneous little new nation".

500|$|The idea of {{creating}} Raiden originated from Hideo Kojima's desire {{to view the}} Metal Gear series protagonist Solid Snake from a <b>different</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, inspired by the Sherlock Holmes stories {{as well as a}} fanletter wanting a younger character to be featured in the series. Raiden's inclusion remained a secret to gamers before his debut; despite some players' reactions, the staff liked his character. In order to appeal most fans of the series, the character has been redesign for Metal Gear Solid 4. He was once again redesigned for both the cancelled game Metal Gear Solid: Rising and its reboot Revengeance in order to portray a darker side of his character, In Japanese, the character is voiced by [...] Kenyu Horiuchi and in English by Quinton Flynn.|$|E

500|$|Cooder's displeasure {{with the}} Republican Party and its {{financial}} supporters, particularly the Koch Brothers, also inspired his songwriting. He found {{the party to}} be [...] "insanely dangerous" [...] to Barack Obama's presidency and the US, and said of them in an interview for The Guardian, [...] "in case anybody thinks Michele Bachmann or Sarah Palin are clowns because they misspeak or don't know their history or they say silly things: that's just an act, and it's a useful act. Everything is a distraction from the core truths which are, first of all, that corporations have taken over the country." [...] He viewed that his songs for the album provide a more convenient alternative for citizens who do not research politicians, saying that [...] "I don't write books and give speeches but with a four-minute song you can use allegory and other means to suggest a <b>different</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view. It's like looking around the corner, and that's what songs are good at sometimes. They hit you with a new thought – assuming that people will listen." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the only}} {{surviving}} eyewitnesses to these events being from the Indian {{side and the}} passage of time since the battle, many of the details given by the Indian participants were still controversial and not believed (Custer's widow Libbie, who had dedicated her life to enshrining the memory of her husband as a hero and who attacked anyone offering a <b>different</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, was still alive). [...] Special exception is taken to the claim that many of Custer's men committed suicide when defeat seemed inevitable. [...] The claim that Tom Custer's body was decapitated by the Indians is also disputed for reasons that are not made clear. [...] The identification of the headless body as Tom Custer is not from Wooden Leg, who {{at the time of the}} battle knew nothing of either Custer or his brother Tom, but is information provided by Marquis. Wooden Leg had merely described the markings he saw on the body. [...] Tom Custer's biography describes the decapitation as indisputable fact, as the body was identified from tattoos.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} he wrote Connotations, Copland {{had come to the}} view that serial {{composition}} was [...] "like looking at a picture from a <b>different</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view" [...] and used it [...] "with the hope that it would freshen and enrich my [...] technique." [...] Part of that changed viewpoint, Copland said, [...] "was that I began to hear chords that I wouldn't have heard otherwise. Heretofore, I had been thinking tonally, but this was a new way of moving tones about." [...] Serialism also allowed Copland a synthesis of serial and non-serial practices that had long concerned Copland and he had previously felt impossible to attain. One challenge Copland said he faced while he composed Connotations was [...] "to construct an overall line that had continuity, dramatic force and an inherent unity." [...] He stated that he had faced a similar challenge in his Orchestral Variations (his orchestration of the Piano Variations). He added that while dodecaphonic techniques supplied [...] "the building blocks" [...] for Connotations, it was up to him to supply [...] "the edifice" [...] that these blocks would eventually form.|$|E
500|$|Critics gave mixed {{opinions}} to the team-up dynamic. Nich Maragos from 1UP.com celebrated that Sonic Team had [...] "finally [...] {{up with a}} way {{of introducing}} teamwork and variance between characters that doesn't overwhelm Sonic's bread-and-butter gameplay." [...] Maragos singled this out as the main divider between Advance 3 and Sonic Heroes, a game that he found surprisingly linear in level design considering that it, unlike Advance 3, was in 3D. Maragos, GameSpot's Frank Provo, IGN's Craig Harris, and Game Informers Lisa Mason appreciated the increase in replayability Sonic's friends brought. However, Mason, as well as reviewer Stardingo from GamePro, thought that they played too much like Sonic and did not add much to the experience. Darryl Vassar of GameSpy took a <b>different</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> criticism: he acknowledged the presence of genuinely different character abilities, but perceived that their only purpose was to find Chao, whom he called [...] "pointless". Maragos noted that the [...] "mid-air trick" [...] system from Advance 2 was optional in Advance 3, but spoke positively about its usefulness in locating [...] "hidden areas". Harris argued that such varying team abilities contributed to occasional [...] "cheapness" [...] in the level design, because [...] "most of the characters have absolutely no defense when hopping off items like springboards".|$|E
500|$|Sites {{have also}} praised the game's story, for its {{accessibility}} {{as a result}} of being a prequel, or that it did not bear elements from previous games that tended to confuse gamers such as the characters' identities. Critics also appreciated how the story is told from three different perspectives, which helped to give <b>different</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> views as well as expand the time the game can be played. Nevertheless, some character traits were criticized such as the similarities between the protagonists to previous ones. While Eurogamer cited that the three characters had little impact to the Disney worlds' storyline, Terra's role was praised by 1UP.com for distancing itself from previous scenarios. Although the lack of Final Fantasy characters received mixed opinions, PSM thought that it helped to expand the exploration of Disney worlds, while Zack's role was found suitable by GameZone. The English casting for Birth by Sleep also received positive comments with GameTrailers stating that it [...] "features one of the few good English dubs in recent memory", particularly Leonard Nimoy's performance. GameSpot stated that Ventus' and Aqua's voice actor to have done a good job voicing them, but criticized Terra's as one of the worst ones from the game, most notably, when compared with other well-received actors.|$|E
