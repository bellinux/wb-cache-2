25|$|Intel Corporation saw {{the massive}} {{potential}} of the invention and introduced the first commercial NOR type flash chip in 1988. NOR-based flash has long erase and write times, but provides <b>full</b> <b>address</b> and data buses, allowing random access to any memory location. This makes it a suitable replacement for older read-only memory (ROM) chips, which are used to store program code that rarely needs to be updated, such as a computer's BIOS or the firmware of set-top boxes. Its endurance may be from as little as 100 erase cycles for an on-chip flash memory, to a more typical 10,000 or 100,000 erase cycles, up to 1,000,000 erase cycles. NOR-based flash was the basis of early flash-based removable media; CompactFlash was originally based on it, though later cards moved to less expensive NANDflash.|$|E
