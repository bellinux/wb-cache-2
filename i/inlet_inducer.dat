For a given <b>inducer</b> <b>inlet</b> area, increases in diffuser area {{within the range}} investigated resulted in increased mass flow and higher peak efficiency.

The experimental analysis {{focused on the}} cavitating structures at {{the periphery of the}} inducer, the quantification of the vapour volume at <b>inducer</b> <b>inlet,</b> its relation with the backflow and the obstruction effect on the main flow. A 2 D numerical model of unsteady cavitation was applied to a blade cascade drawn from the inducer geometry. Unsteady behaviour of sheet cavities attached to the blade suction side depends on the flow rate and cavitation number.

40|$|The {{unsteady}} fluid {{dynamic performance}} of a cavitating two-bladed oxidizer turbopump inducer was characterized through sub-scale water flow testing. While testing a novel inlet duct design that included a cavitation suppression groove, unusual high-frequency pressure oscillations were observed. With potential implications for inducer blade loads, these high-frequency components were analyzed extensively {{in order to understand}} their origins and impacts to blade loading. Water flow testing provides a technique to determine pump performance without the costs and hazards associated with handling cryogenic propellants. Water has a similar density and Reynolds number to liquid oxygen. In a 70 %-scale water flow test, the inducer-only pump performance was evaluated. Over a range of flow rates, the pump inlet pressure was gradually reduced, causing the flow to cavitate near the pump inducer. A nominal, smooth <b>inducer</b> <b>inlet</b> was tested, followed by an inlet duct with a circumferential groove designed to suppress cavitation. A subsequent 52 %-scale water flow test in another facility evaluated the combined inducer-impeller pump performance. With the nominal <b>inlet</b> design, the <b>inducer</b> showed traditional cavitation and surge characteristics. Significant bearing loads were created by large side loads on the inducer during synchronous cavitation. The grooved inlet successfully mitigated these loads by greatly reducing synchronous cavitation, however high-frequency pressure oscillations were observed over a range of frequencies. Analytical signal processing techniques showed these oscillations to be created by a rotating, multi-celled train of pressure pulses, and subsequent CFD analysis suggested that such pulses could be created by the interaction of rotating inducer blades with fluid trapped in a cavitation suppression groove. Despite their relatively low amplitude, these high-frequency pressure oscillations posed a design concern due to their sensitivity to flow conditions and test scale. The amplitude and frequency of oscillations varied considerably over the pump s operating space, making it difficult to predict blade loads...|$|R

The effects of dissolved ullage gases, wall elasticity, localized gas or vapor bubbles, bellows, forced changes in length due to structural excitation, complex side branches, and structural mounting stiffness are also included. Each line component is written as a four-terminal, pressure-flow relationship in matrix form in the Laplace domain; the transfer function relating the pressure response at the line terminal (<b>inducer</b> <b>inlet)</b> to the external excitation is obtained in the computer program by sequential matrix substitution...|$|R
40|$|A {{ring groove}} {{arrangement}} is proposed to suppress unstable flow or surge in a centrifugal blower. The ring groove arrangement connects the upstream position of impeller <b>inlet</b> and the <b>inducer</b> throat tip through a bypass. The recirculation flow {{was formed by}} the pressure {{difference between the two}} positions, and the recirculation flow rate was changed by increasing the ring groove widths. The inlet recirculation results in a decrease in the flow rate of unstable flow inception, and an up to 8 % improvement in stall limit was obtained by the ring groove arrangement at a small expense of the delivery pressure drop. The improvement of stall limit in the present experiment seems to be mainly due to decrease in flow incidence based on the inlet recirculation flow. Tre flow incidence decreases more as the recirculation flow rate increases, thus resulting in a larger improvement in stall limit...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{details of}} measurements on the instability know as auto-oscillation which occurs in systems with cavitating pumps. Specific measurements {{are made of}} onset cavitation number and auto-osciallation frequency {{for a range of}} inducers. It has been shown that auto-oscillation is a system instability caused by the active dynamic characteristics of the cavitating pump. A system anslysis is presented which utilized previously measured dynamic transfer functions for the inducers; the resulting predictions of instability are consistent with the observations. Though the onset cavitation number {{is a function of the}} entire system it is also show that, given the onset cavitation number, the auto-oscillation frequency is only weakly dependent on the system and primarily a function of the pump dynamics. Detailed measurements of the amplitude and phase of fluctuating pressures and flow rates during auto-oscillation are also presented. These strongly suggest that the pump dynamics are primarily determined by the complicated flow at <b>inlet</b> to the <b>inducer</b> which involves pre-swirl generated by a strong backflow. Some data on the non-linear effect of auto-osciallation on overall mean performance are also presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{backflow}} vortexes at the suction {{connection in}} high-speed centrifugal pumps have {{negative effect on}} the flow field. Setting an orifice plate in front of the inducer is able to decrease the negative effect caused by backflow vortexes. The traditional plate is able to partially control the backflow vortexes, but {{a small part of the}} vortex is still in the <b>inlet</b> and the <b>inducer.</b> Four new types of orifice plates were created, and the control effects on backflow vortexes were analyzed. The ANSYS-CFX software was used to numerically simulate a high-speed centrifugal pump. The variations of streamline and velocity vectors at the suction connection were analyzed. Meanwhile, the effects of these plates on the impeller pressure and the internal flow field of the inducer were analyzed. Numerically, simulation and experimental data analysis methods were used to compare the head and efficiency of the high-speed pumps. The results show that the C-type orifice plate can improve the backflow vortex, reduce the low-pressure area, and improve the hydraulic performance of the high-speed pump...|$|R

40|$|This work aims to {{characterize}} the dynamic behavior of a four bladed inducer and clarify the physical mechanism {{that leads to the}} onset of rotating cavitation. The inducer under consideration is representative of a low-pressure liquid oxygen pump (LPOP) inducer of modern design and incorporates several standard design features used in rocket turbopumps to suppress rotating cavitation. The mechanism is characterized based on a combination of two-phase numerical simulations and inducer experiments. Experimental measurements demonstrate a supersynchronous rotating cavity in the periphery of the <b>inducer</b> <b>inlet</b> at frequencies between 1. 2 and 1. 6 times rotor frequency and a synchronous 2 nd spatial harmonic pattern associated with alternate blade cavitation. The analysis indicates a causal link between alternate blade cavitation and rotating cavitation, with a distinct cut-on cut-off behavior. Numerical calculations and high-speed videos elucidate the mechanism of breakdown of alternate blade cavitation and the formation of rotating cavitation. The present work suggests that rotating cavitation is caused by the coupling of the cavities on adjacent blades during alternate blade cavitation. Due to the nearly tangential flow, the vortex lines from one of the non-cavitating blades wrap around the blade leading edge of the adjacent blade, which yields a drop in static pressure and cavity formation. The tip vortex cavity interaction with {{the leading edge of the}} blade leads to sheet cavity breakdown with periodic growth and collapse of cavities, creating the apparent super-synchronous rotation of the cavitating region.

40|$|Use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes, {{prevalent}} in the rocket engine turbomachinery industry, necessitates data of sufficient quality and quantity to benchmark computational codes. Existing data bases for typical rocket engine configurations, in particular impellers, are limited. In addition, traditional data acquisition methods have several limitations: typically transducer uncertainties are 0. 5 % of transducer full scale and traditional pressure probes are unable to provide flow characteristics in the circumferential (blade-to-blade) direction. Laser velocimetry circumvents these limitations by providing + 0. 5 % uncertainty in flow velocity and + 0. 5 % uncertainty in flow angle. The percent of uncertainty in flow velocity {{is based on the}} measured value, not full range capability. The laser electronics multiple partitioning capability allows data acquired between blades as the impeller rotates, to be analyzed separately, thus providing blade-to-blade flow characterization. Unlike some probes, the non-intrusive measurements made with the laser velocimeter does not disturb the flow. To this end,, and under Contract (NAS 8 - 38864) to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), an extensive test program was undertaken at Rocketdyne. Impellers from two different generic rocket engine pump configurations were examined. The impellers represent different spectrums of pump design: the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) high pressure fuel turbopump (HPFTP) impeller was designed in the 1 1970 's the Consortium for CFD application in Propulsion Technology Pump Stage Technology Team (Pump Consortium) optimized impeller was designed with the aid of modern computing techniques. The tester configuration for each of the impellers consisted of an axial <b>inlet,</b> an <b>inducer,</b> a diffuser, and a crossover discharge. While the tested configurations were carefully chosen to be representative of generic rocket engine pumps, several features of both testers were intentionally atypical. A crossover discharge, downstream of the impeller, rather than a volute discharge was used to minimize asymmetric flow conditions that might be reflected in the impeller discharge flow data. Impeller shroud wear ring radial clearances were purposely close to minimize leakage flow, thus increasing confidence in using the inlet data as an input to CFD programs. The empirical study extensively examined the flow fields of the two impellers via performance of laser two-focus velocimeter surveys in an axial plane upstream of the impellers and in multiple radial planes downstream of the impellers. Both studies were performed at the impeller design flow coefficients. Inlet laser surveys that provide CFD code inlet boundary conditions were performed in one axial plane, with ten radial locations surveyed. Three wall static pressures, positioned circumferentially around the impeller inlet, were used to identify asymmetrical pressure distributions in the inlet survey plane. The impeller discharge flow characterization consisted of three radial planes for the SSME HPFTP impeller and two radial planes for the Pump Consortium optimized impeller. Housing wall static pressures were placed to correspond to the radial locations surveyed with the laser velocimeter. Between five and thirteen axial stations across the discharge channel width were examined in each radial plane during the extensive flow mapping. The largely successful empirical flow characterization of two different impellers resulted in a substantial contribution to the limited existing data base, and yielded accurate data for CFD code benchmarking...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} National Aeronautics and Space Administration's ongoing {{effort to}} {{lower the cost of}} access to space, the Marshall Space Flight Center has {{developed}} a rocket engine with 60, 000 pounds of thrust for use on the Reusable Launch Vehicle technology demonstrator slated for launch in 2000. This gas generator cycle engine, known as the Fastrac engine, uses liquid oxygen and RP- 1 for propellants and includes single stage liquid oxygen and RP- 1 pumps and a single stage supersonic turbine on a common shaft. The turbopump design effort included the first use and application of new suction capability prediction codes and three-dimensional blade generation codes in an attempt to reduce the turbomachinery design and certification costs typically associated with rocket engine development. To verify the pump's predicted cavitation performance, a water flow test of a superscale model of the Fastrac liquid oxygen pump was conducted to experimentally evaluate the liquid oxygen pump's performance at and around the design point. The water flow test article replicated the flow path of the Fastrac liquid oxygen pump in a 1. 582 x scale model, including scaled seal clearances for correct leakage flow at a model operating speed of 5000 revolutions per minute. Flow entered the 3 -blade axial-flow inducer, transitioned to a shrouded, 6 - blade radial impeller, and discharged into a vaneless radial diffuser and collection volute. The test article included approximately 50 total and static pressure measurement locations as well as flush-mounted, high frequency pressure transducers for complete mapping of the pressure environment. The primary objectives of the water flow test were to measure the steady-state and dynamic pressure environment of the liquid oxygen pump versus flow coefficient, suction specific speed, and back face leakage flow rate. Initial results showed acceptable correlation between the predicted and experimentally measured pump head rise at low suction specific speeds. Likewise, only small circumferential variations in steady-state were observed from 80 % to 120 % of the design flow coefficient, matching the computational predictions and confirming that the integrated design approach has minimized any exit volute-induced distortions. The test article exhibited suction performance trends typically observed in inducer designs with virtually constant head rise with decreasing inlet pressure until complete pump head breakdown. Unfortunately, the net positive suction head at 3 % head fall-off occurred far below that predicted at all tested flow coefficients, resulting in a negative net positive suction head margin at the design point in water. Additional testing to map the unsteady pressure environment was conducted and cavitation-induced flow disturbances at the <b>inducer</b> <b>inlet</b> were observed. Two distinct disturbances were identified, one rotating and one stationary relative to the fixed frame of reference, while the transition from one regime to the next produced significant effects on the steady state pump performance. The impact of the unsteady phenomena and the corresponding energy losses on the unexpectedly poor pump performance is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|After a brief {{review of}} flow-induced instabilities in turbopumps for liquid {{propellant}} feed systems of modern rocket engines, the lecture illustrates some recent results of the work carried out at Alta on the hydrodynamics and unsteady cavitation phenomena of these machines. A reduced order model for preliminary design and noncavitating performance prediction of tapered axial inducers is illustrated. In the incompressible, inviscid, irrotational flow approximation the model expresses the 3 D flow field in the blade channels by superposing a 2 D cross-sectional vorticity correction to a fully-guided axisymmetric flow with radially uniform axial velocity. Suitable redefinition of the diffusion factor for bladings with non-negligible radial flow allows for the control of the blade loading and the estimate of the boundary layer blockage at the specified design flow coefficient, providing a simple criterion for matching the hub profile to the axial variation of the blade pitch angle. Carter’s rule is employed to account for flow deviation at the inducer trailing edge. Mass continuity, angular momentum conservation and Euler’s equation are used to derive a simple 2 nd order boundary value problem, whose numerical solution describes the far field axisymmetric flow at the inducer discharge. A closed form approximate solution is also provided, which proved to yield equivalently accurate results in the prediction of the inducer performance. Finally, the noncavitating pumping characteristic is obtained by introducing suitably adapted correlations of pressure losses and flow deviation effects. The model has been verified to closely approximate the geometry and noncavitating performance of a number of tapered-hub high-head inducers for space application. The results of a series of tests conducted in water under similarity conditions on the four-bladed DAPAMITO 4 inducer, designed and manufactured by means of the above reduced-order model, are illustrated. Several non-synchronous instabilities have been observed on the inducer, including an axial surge, a backflow oscillation and, at higher temperatures, incipient rotating cavitation and backflow vortex instability. In addition, synchronous rotating cavitation (leading to the characteristic “one step” shape of the cavitating performance curve near head breakdown conditions) has been detected at all the flow conditions investigated. It has been found that the amplitude of the flow oscillations associated to this instability generally tends to decrease at higher water temperatures. The characterization of the rotordynamic forces acting on a whirling four-bladed, tapered-hub, variable-pitch high-head inducer, under different load and cavitation conditions is presented. The results have obtained in the Cavitating Pump Rotordynamic Test Facility at Alta by means of a novel experimental technique, allowing for the continuous measurement of the rotordynamic force spectra as functions of the whirl ratio. Comparison with simultaneous high-speed movies of the <b>inducer</b> <b>inlet</b> flow highlighted the relationship between the cavitation dynamics in the inducer backflow and the spectral behavior of the rotordynamic force as functions of the whirl ratio. Finally, the future perspectives of the work carried out at Alta on the hydrodynamics and unsteady cavitation phenomena of high performance turbopumps for liquid propellant feed systems of modern rocket engines are briefly illustrated...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} a shroud bleed slot system of a compressor stage from a turbocharger unit used in heavy duty diesel engines of approximately 300 kW. The {{first part of the}} work presented in this thesis deals with a detailed analysis of a compressor stage with and without a shroud bleed slot, and various slot geometries which include three different widths and three different positions of the slot. The second stage of this study is an investigation of an addition of a set of vanes in the annular cavity of the shroud bleed slot system. This investigation was performed using both CFD modelling and experimental measurements. The CFD model used a full stage steady state approach. Very good agreement was achieved between the experimental measurements of efficiency, pressure ratio and mass flow rate and those values predicted by the CFD model over the entire performance map, providing confidence in the CFD model as a tool to help understand the flow features of the bleed slot, its various geometries and an addition of annular cavity vanes. The first stage of the study emphasises the significance of the inclusion of a shroud bleed slot into the conventional turbocharger compressor stage and the appropriate choice of the slot geometry in order to achieve as the widest map possible. In comparison with the non-bleed slot compressor stage, the bleed slot significantly extended the map width at the higher speeds, by reducing the surge mass flow rate. However, no or very little improvement was found at lower speeds. The analysis of changes to design parameters revealed that it is vital to obtain an optimised geometry of the bleed slot system for a compressor stage to achieve a wider map without compromising other performance characteristics of the compressor. This study also discloses the importance of an optimised shape of the shroud bleed slot system to increase the compressor performance by avoiding the recirculation losses within the slot and cavity passages at both choke and surge flow conditions. In the second stage of the work presented in this thesis, three different types of the annular cavity vane (straight, positive curved and negative curved vanes) have been designed and investigated. The purpose of the annular cavity vane technique is to remove some of the positive swirl that can be carried through the bleed slot system, which would influence the pressure ratio. In addition to this, the series of cavity vanes provides better guidance to the slot recirculating flow before it mixes with the impeller main inlet flow. Better guidance of the flow improves the mixing at the <b>inducer</b> <b>inlet</b> in the circumferential direction. As a consequence, the stability of the compressor is improved at lower flow rates and a wider map can be achieved. The impact of these three cavity vane designs on the map width and performance of the compressor has been highlighted through a detailed analysis of the impeller and cavity vane bleed slot flow field. Interestingly, all three types of cavity vane showed an improvement in map width by moving the surge point to a lower mass flow rate with no significant efficiency penalty over the entire operating range. This improvement was most evident at the highest running speed. In particular, the negative curved vane showed a significant increase in map width which re{{presents an}} extra 67 % improvement in map width that was achieved between the baseline bleed slot and non-bleed slot configurations.
