40|$|Low {{frequency}} noise {{generated from}} <b>impact</b> <b>sources</b> on floors {{is becoming more}} significant due to the trend of using lighter building components. The amount of sound power that gets injected into the floor depends on the impedance matching between the source (e. g. barefoot or shoe walkers) and the receiving surface (e. g. floors unless Spiderman is in the house). In a previous study, it was identified that the impedance of the <b>impact</b> <b>sources</b> at low frequencies has no influence on the power injected into wood or concrete floors without floating toppings. The reason is because the impedance of both the wood and concrete floor {{is much higher than}} the source impedance and only the force controls the amount of power injected into the floor. In this current study, calculation models are used to simulate the effect of a floating topping on the injected power by investigating the resulting impedance and impedance match between the floor with a floating topping and the two standardized ISO <b>impact</b> <b>sources</b> (heavy/soft ball and hard tapping machine). Finally, the relevance of impact source impedance at low frequencies will be presented for floors with floating toppings. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Journal of Strategic Information Systems and the definitive published version is available at [URL] sourcing – the practice of bringing digitally-enabled outsourcing jobs to marginalized individuals – is an important emerging social innovation in the outsourcing industry. The <b>impact</b> <b>sourcing</b> model of delivering Information Technology and Business Process Outsourcing (IT–BPO) services not only seeks to deliver business value for clients, but is also driven by an explicit social mission to help marginalized communities enjoy the benefits of globalization. This dual focus {{has led to the}} ambitious claim that social value creation can be integral to (and not always by-products of) innovative IT–BPO models. Given the relative newness of the <b>impact</b> <b>sourcing</b> business model there is scarce research about how <b>impact</b> <b>sourcing</b> companies emerge and the process through which entrepreneurs build and operate such companies. This paper draws on a qualitative study of seven Indian <b>impact</b> <b>sourcing</b> companies and develops a process model of the individual-level motivational triggers of <b>impact</b> <b>sourcing</b> entrepreneurship, the entrepreneurial actions underpinning different phases of venture creation and the positive institutional-level influences on <b>impact</b> <b>sourcing.</b> The paper argues that since deeply personalized values are central to the creation and development of <b>impact</b> <b>sourcing</b> companies, the business model may not be easy to replicate. The analysis highlights an intensive period of embedding and robust alliances with local partners as crucial for the scalability and sustainability of the <b>impact</b> <b>sourcing</b> business model. It also emphasizes the role of ‘social’ encoding and mimicry in determining the extent to which <b>impact</b> <b>sourcing</b> companies are able to retain their commitment to marginalized communities...|$|R

Explosive or <b>impact</b> <b>sources,</b> which have been frequently used, can destroy the ambient rocks and could change the propagation property around the source. To overcome such shortcomings, a controlled source for long-term continuous monitoring, named ACROSS, which stands for Accurately Controlled Routinely Operated Signal System, was developed (Kumazawa and Takei 1994). In the ACROSS, the seismic signal is generated by the centrifugal force of a rotating eccentric mass.

40|$|International audiencePrevious {{research}} on the standard tapping machine {{has shown that the}} impact on a floor depends strongly on the combined system of floor and tapping hammers.

Conversion from one <b>impact</b> <b>source</b> to another has to be made for each floor individually, provided there is a sufficient knowledge of the dynamic properties of the source and floor. So, if the standard tapping machine is to be used to characterise a floor with respect to walking noise, the only simple way out of the problem is to make it 'behave like a walker'. That means it should have the same source impedance. Investigations at the Fraunhofer-Institut für Bauphysik Stuttgart showed that this could be achieved by small modifications to the standard tapping machine.
