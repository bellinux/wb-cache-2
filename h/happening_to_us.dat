[...] He stopped, and shrank away, under the anxious {{scrutiny}} of Allan's eyes. [...] "If you will have it," [...] he burst out, abruptly, [...] "the horror of that night on board the Wreck has got me again; there's a dreadful oppression on my head; there's a dreadful sinking at my heart. I am afraid of something <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> if we don't part before the day is out. I can't break my promise to you; for God's sake, release me from it, and let me go back!" ...|$|E

You may put the {{remuneration}} for your services at whatever figure you like in reason, and {{it shall be}} paid over to you before we start. Moreover, I will arrange {{in the event of}} anything untoward <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> or to you, that your son shall be suitably provided for. You will see from this offer how necessary I think your presence. Also if by chance we should reach this place, and find diamonds, they shall belong to you and Good equally. I do not want them. But of course that promise is worth nothing at all, though the same thing would apply to any ivory we might get. You may pretty well make your own terms with me, Mr. Quatermain; and of course I shall pay all expenses." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I want {{to begin}} by saying that choice isn't so easy and so {{necessary}} as it seems. We {{think we are going}} to choose presently, and in the end we may never choose at all. Choice needs perhaps more energy than we think. The great multitude of older people we can observe in the world outside there, haven't chosen either in the matter of the world outside, where they shall go, what they shall do, what part they shall play, or in the matter of the world within, what they will be and what they are determined they will never be. They are still in much the same state of suspended choice as we seem to be in, but in the meanwhile THINGS HAPPEN TO THEM. And things are <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> things will happen to us, while we still suppose ourselves in the wings waiting to be consulted about the casting of the piece....|$|E
60|$|The most {{wonderful}} {{things have happened}} and are continually <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> All the paper that I possess consists of five old note-books {{and a lot of}} scraps, and I have only the one stylographic pencil; but so long as I can move my hand I will continue to set down our experiences and impressions, for, since we are the only men of the whole human race to see such things, it is of enormous importance that I should record them whilst they are fresh in my memory and before that fate which seems to be constantly impending does actually overtake us. Whether Zambo can at last take these letters to the river, or whether I shall myself in some miraculous way carry them back with me, or, finally, whether some daring explorer, coming upon our tracks with the advantage, perhaps, of a perfected monoplane, should find this bundle of manuscript, in any case I can see that what I am writing is destined to immortality as a classic of true adventure.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{all very}} well," [...] said Sir Richmond in the {{resolute}} voice of one who will be pent no longer. [...] "That {{is all very}} well {{as far as it}} goes. But it does not cover my case. I am not suffering from inadaptation. I HAVE adapted. I have thought things out. I think--much as you do. Much as you do. So it's not that. But--... Mind you, I am perfectly clear where I am. Where we are. What is <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> all is the breakup of the entire system. Agreed! We have to make another system or perish amidst the wreckage. I see that clearly. Science and plan have to replace custom and tradition in human affairs. Soon. Very soon. Granted. Granted. We used to say all that. Even before the war. Now we mean it. We've muddled about in the old ways overlong. Some new sort of world, planned and scientific, has to be got going. Civilization renewed. Rebuilding civilization--while the premises are still occupied and busy. It's an immense enterprise, but it is the only thing to be done. In some ways it's an enormously attractive enterprise. Inspiring. It grips my imagination. I think of the other men who must be at work. Working as I do rather in the dark as yet. With whom I shall presently join up... The attempt may fail; all things human may fail; {{but on the other hand}} it may succeed. I never had such faith in anything as I have in the rightness of the work I am doing now. I begin at that. But here is where my difficulty comes in. The top of my brain, my innermost self says all that I have been saying, but--The rest of me won't follow. The rest of me refuses to attend, forgets, straggles, misbehaves." ...|$|E

5000|$|The whole {{record was}} about pretty much {{standing}} up for yourself and, {{a lot of people}} do really shitty things to you. That's what was <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> a lot, and that ...you shouldn't back down from people. - Jeremy McKinnon, upon being asked what message the album was trying to convey, 2007 Woodard was put in touch with a representative from record label Victory Records. Victory auditioned the band in June, and following a week-long worth of phone calls, the group were told of Victory's interest in signing them up.|$|E
5000|$|The {{stress of}} living in the US {{influenced}} their recording, and left Kilbey feeling out of place: [...] "The Church came to L.A. and really reacted against the place because none of us liked it. I hated where I was living. I hated driving this horrible little red car around {{on the wrong side of}} the road. I hate that there's no one walking on the streets and I missed my home. All the billboards, conversations I'd overhear, TV shows, everything that was <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> was going into the music". [...] Album tracks such as [...] "North, South, East and West," [...] "Lost," [...] "Reptile" [...] and [...] "Destination" [...] bore the imprint of the faces, scenery and daily life of the group's new, temporary home.|$|E

5000|$|In a 1984 {{interview}} with Record Mirror, Lea spoke of [...] "Mama Weer All Crazee" [...] and [...] "Cum On Feel the Noize": [...] "I {{was at a}} Chuck Berry gig in '72 and everybody was singing his tunes. He kept stopping and letting the crowd sing and it wasn't just a few people, it was everyone. I thought it was amazing and thought - why not write the crowd into the songs, and so we got round to [...] "Mama Weer All Crazee Now" [...] and [...] "Cum On Feel the Noize" [...] and all the chants were written into the tunes." [...] In a 1986 fan club interview, guitarist Dave Hill said: [...] "The song was based around audiences and things that were <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> They were just experiences. Obviously, when {{you are on the}} road, you are writing about being on the road, you're writing about what's going on." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{relationship}} between personality and people's own well-being is influenced and mediated by genes (Weiss, Bates, & Luciano, 2008). There {{has been found}} to be a stable set point for happiness that is characteristic of the individual (largely determined by the individual's genes). Happiness fluctuates around that setpoint (again, genetically determined) based on whether good things or bad things are <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> ("nurture"), but only fluctuates in small magnitude in a normal human. The midpoint of these fluctuations is determined by the [...] "great genetic lottery" [...] that people are born with, which leads them to conclude that how happy they may feel at the moment or over time is simply due to the luck of the draw, or gene. This fluctuation was also not due to educational attainment, which only accounted for less than 2% of the variance in well-being for women, and less than 1% of the variance for men.|$|E
5000|$|Collins and Fagenson played {{extensively}} as Eve 6 {{starting in}} 2008, with guitarist Matt Bair temporarily replacing Siebels who was occupied with his project Monsters Are Waiting. The band {{spent the next}} three years touring, writing and reconnecting with fans, then in 2011, armed with new material and management, signed with Fearless Records. A month within inking the deal Collins and Fagenson finally convinced Siebels to return to the fold. “After going down some different paths it hit me that there was this thing out there that people wanted and wanted to hear,” explains Siebels. “It just clicked and made sense to me. After such a long break I was so happy to be playing with these guys again.” Continues Fagenson, [...] "The way Siebels hits the strings and puts that muscle into the chords is very distinctive to our band, and that was a welcome piece of the sound that we had missed. Songs that had been kicking around for a couple years got new life with his playing put into them.” [...] Eve 6 then re-enlisted Don Gilmore (Linkin Park, Dashboard Confessional, Good Charlotte)—who produced the first two Eve 6 full-lengths—to helm the sessions for Speak in Code. With all the lead time, the album contains a mix of compositions that began {{as far back as the}} side project, as well as recent works written in the months leading up to the recording process. “We were really taking a ‘best of everything’ sort of approach, almost like a band's first album, in which there's a lot of material to choose from,” Fagenson notes. “About half the songs were standouts from what Max and I had been working on and demoing over the years, and the other half were newer ideas that came with the inspiration of Jon's return and all that was <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> at the time. We have a unique process, where each song is sort of its own animal. Don was crucial in helping us tighten everything up, and inspiring Max to dig really deep lyrically and get to some root emotion down there.” Explains Collins, [...] "Neil Finn Crowded House once said, 'A great producer is someone whom you admire musically and otherwise, who you feel compelled to show up and show off for.' I feel like Don is that figure for me and the band." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 2012, the {{director}} of Art Dubai, Antonia Carver, invited Basar to reinvent its associated cultural program, the Global Art Forum, which had been running since 2007 in a form derived from Art Basel Talks. Global Art Forum 6, under {{the director}}ship of Basar, was entitled [...] "The Medium of Media" [...] and took place in Doha, Qatar (18/19 March 2012) and Dubai (21-24 March 2012). It expanded the disciplinary remit to include novelists, historians, filmmakers and journalists; as well as introducing the Globe Books imprint; long term research projects and curated art and media exhibitions. [...] "The Medium of Media" [...] investigated {{the meaning of the}} word [...] "media" [...] in an art context as well as the role that media played in the unfolding of the Arab Spring which was barely a year old at that point. This was followed by Global Art Forum 7 (17-23 March 2013), commissioned by Basar, directed by H.G.Masters, and entitled [...] "It Means This." [...] The theme of language has been an ongoing concern for Basar, who has said, [...] "Contemporary reality is often ahead of our ability to describe it, because we are still left behind in the terminology of the previous era or moment. Such a schism leads to blindness about what is actually <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> around us." [...] Global Art Forum 8 (15/16 & 19-21 March 2014) was commissioned by Basar, directed by Omar Berrada and Ala Younis, and entitled [...] "Meanwhile... History." [...] It assembled an imaginary timeline of histories lost, forgotten and erased. Topics included Soviet Orientalism, Pan Kaffirism, Ibn Khaldun's The Muqadimmah, [...] and Trajectories of the Sudanese Gulf. The 2015 edition of Global Art Forum 9, entitled [...] "Download Update?" [...] was co-directed by Sultan Sooud Al-Qassemi and Turi Munthe, with Basar acting as Director-as-Large. 2016's edition marked the tenth anniversary of the Global Art Forum. It was called [...] "The Future Was" [...] (9/14 January & 16-18 March 2016), co-directed by Amal Khalaf and Uzma Z. Rizvi, with Basar as Commissioner, focusing on how visions of the future have been formulated in the past. Guests included Hito Steyerl, Elie Ayache, Alice Gorman, Adrienne Maree Brown, Noura Al Noman, Lauren Beukes and Sophia Al Maria. [...] "Trading Places" [...] was the title of the 2017 iteration of the Global Art Forum, co-directed by Antonia Carver and Oscar Guardiola-Rivera, with Basar, again, as Commissioner.|$|E
