5|$|George Baxter, {{a pioneer}} of colour printing, made a {{well-known}} engraving which imagines Crystal Palace, set in its landscaped grounds with tall fountains and the dinosaurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreground,</b> before the 1854 opening.|$|E
5|$|He used {{friends as}} models, {{most notably the}} painter Eugène Delacroix (1798–1863), who {{modelled}} for the figure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreground</b> with face turned downward and one arm outstretched. Two of the raft's survivors are seen in shadow {{at the foot of}} the mast; three of the figures were painted from life—Corréard, Savigny and Lavillette. Jamar posed nude for the dead youth shown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreground</b> about to slip into the sea, and was also the model for two other figures.|$|E
5|$|The buffalo is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreground,</b> facing to {{the left}} of front. His tail is up, front feet on the ground with back feet in the air, as he jumps over a log.|$|E

5|$|The game {{introduces}} a four-player option in Versus Mode, giving a player four characters who can fight two-on-two, three-on-one or everyone-for-themselves. There are two fighting planes, one <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreground</b> {{and the other}} behind it.|$|E
5|$|In the painting, {{the medieval}} city is viewed looking east {{with the dark}} waters of Riddarfjärden <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreground</b> and the {{interior}} of the Stockholm archipelago in the background. Although the event depicted is said to have occurred in the morning, the city is painted in evening light.|$|E
5|$|The {{color in}} the {{original}} print is breathtaking; Redskin leaves an impression of a kaleidoscope of awe-inspiring backgrounds, with such much happening <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreground</b> that one hardly has time {{to take in the}} whole frame. The color is used for emotional impact; black and white (toned amber) represents the world of the white man; color is reserved for scenes of Indian life.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of a Signal Hill {{oil well}} view, ca. 1929. A small {{building}} {{can be seen}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right <b>foreground.</b> A pile of earth and gravel can be seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> left <b>foreground,</b> and, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center <b>foreground,</b> an automobile can be seen {{parked in front of}} many oil derricks in an oil field. The view of the oil derricks extends into the distance. Cylindrical oil storage tanks surround the oil derricks, and utility poles can be seen interspersed among the oil derricks, connected by utility lines...|$|R

The {{background}} shows a few more forested elevations of the Weser Uplands.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of snow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Grand Canyon, Arizona, 1900 - 1940. The {{side of an}} eroded {{snow and}} tree-covered slope can be seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> left <b>foreground,</b> while a peak can be seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center <b>foreground.</b> <b>The</b> canyon can be seen throughout, while a long plateau spans across the background. Low clouds can be seen {{covering}} the sky...|$|R
5|$|The {{pictorial}} {{composition of}} the painting is constructed upon two pyramidal structures. The perimeter of the large mast on {{the left of the}} canvas forms the first. The horizontal grouping of dead and dying figures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreground</b> forms the base from which the survivors emerge, surging upward towards the emotional peak, where the central figure waves desperately at a rescue ship.|$|E
5|$|Adding to {{the inner}} {{complexities}} of the picture and creating further visual interactions is the male dwarf <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreground,</b> whose raised hand echoes the gesture of {{the figure in the}} background, while his playful demeanour, and distraction from the central action, are in complete contrast with it. The informality of his pose, his shadowed profile, and his dark hair all serve to make him a mirror image to the kneeling attendant of the Infanta. However, the painter has set him forward of the light streaming through the window, and so minimised the contrast of tone on this foreground figure.|$|E
5|$|Although the Madonna's throne {{is in the}} mid-ground, {{her head}} is level with the {{standing}} figures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreground,</b> who are closer in perspective. The apse in which she sits adds to the illusion of depth and is an expanded area for her throne. A similar approach {{can be seen in}} the later Dresden Triptych, but that work contains a better handling of spatial depth; Mary's throne is moved back, and the donors and saints are relegated to wing panels. The figures in Canon van der Paele are within a more confined space, are somewhat cramped, but far more monumental.|$|E
5000|$|Thesis - An initial force, statement, or mode. For film, thesis {{could be}} narrative, as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>foregrounded</b> social harmony that is later disrupted; visual, like an opening {{shot of a}} sequence; or {{historical}} presumption, an economic and political situation which carries particular assumptions about the film's context.|$|R

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Friedrich was rediscovered by the Norwegian art {{historian}} Andreas Aubert (1851–1913), whose writing initiated modern Friedrich scholarship, and by the Symbolist painters, who valued his visionary and allegorical landscapes. The Norwegian Symbolist Edvard Munch (1863–1944) would have seen Friedrich's work during a visit to Berlin in the 1880s. Munch's 1899 print The Lonely Ones echoes Friedrich's Rückenfigur (back figure), although in Munch's work the focus has shifted away from the broad landscape and toward the sense of dislocation between the two melancholy figures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreground.</b>|$|E
5|$|Masaccio {{is often}} {{compared}} to contemporaries like Donatello and Brunelleschi as {{a pioneer of}} the renaissance, particularly for his use of single-point perspective. One technique that was unique to Masaccio, however, {{was the use of}} atmospheric, or aerial perspective. Both the mountains in the background, and the figure of Peter on the left are dimmer and paler than the objects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreground,</b> creating an illusion of depth. This technique was known in ancient Rome, but was considered lost until reinvented by Masaccio.|$|E
5|$|O'Donnell hired Chalkie Davies, a {{photographer}} for New Musical Express {{for two weeks}} to photograph the band on a US tour in early 1978 in order to capture enough pictures suitable for the album artwork. The front cover, featuring Lynott <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreground,</b> was originally {{supposed to be the}} back cover as the group wanted equal coverage of all members. O'Donnell disagreed and reversed the front and back photographs at the last minute. The album had a working title of Thin Lizzy Live but Lynott decided that Live and Dangerous was better.|$|E

5|$|On the {{left-hand}} {{side of the}} painting, in the background, {{the structure of the}} temple crumbles and burns {{in the wake of the}} angel's path, while figures in varying stages of undress flee the approaching daemons. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreground</b> a drunken man mimics the pose of the Barberini Faun as he clutches his head, alert enough to realise his fate if he does not escape but too intoxicated to flee.|$|E
5|$|Representations of Old Bridge {{can be seen}} {{in local}} heraldic and civic stationery, {{including}} the crest of Pontypridd Rugby Football Club, and Cilfynydd Rugby Football Club. The community-to-community organisation PONT (Partnerships Overseas Networking Trust), also bases its logo upon the Bridge. Pontypridd High School in Cilfynydd incorporates the bridge design into the school shield, as does Pontypridd Town Council with its logo representing the South Wales Valleys and a section of the Old Bridge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreground.</b> Pontypridd Male Voice Choir also incorporates the Old Bridge in the choir logo.|$|E
5|$|Set {{designers}} modeled the set for Our World after {{a corner}} news stand. For each episode, artifacts {{of the period}} being profiled, including magazines and political posters, decorated the set and a movie marquee listed {{the title of a}} film that was in theatres of the time. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreground</b> was placed an Our World newspaper the headlines of which were the program's title and the name of that program's producer.|$|E

5|$|The current {{design of}} the seal was {{standardized}} by the Indiana General Assembly in 1963. During {{the meeting of the}} General Assembly, Representative Taylor I. Morris introduced legislation to standardize the design of the state seal. His bill described a seal that depicts a woodsman chopping a sycamore tree, while an American Bison runs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreground</b> and the sun rises in the background. The leaves of the state tree, the tulip, were to be the border design. The bill passed the assembly that session and became law.|$|E
5|$|The four-headed god Brahma {{should be}} shown {{seated on the}} ground <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreground</b> officiating as the wedding priest and making offerings to the homa (sacred fire) in the kunda (fire-altar). The four-armed god holds a sruka and sruva (sacrificial ladle and spoon) in his front arms and a kamandalu (water-pot) and akshamala (rosary) in his back arms. The {{presence}} of the fire also indicates another important ritual of the Hindu wedding, saptapadi ("seven steps") where {{the bride and groom}} go around the fire seven times.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} of the D line means it has been detected in many other astronomical environments. In stars, it is seen in any whose surfaces are cool enough for sodium to exist in atomic form (rather than ionised). This corresponds to stars of roughly F-type and cooler. Many other stars {{appear to have a}} sodium absorption line, but this is actually caused by gas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreground</b> interstellar medium. The two can be distinguished via high-resolution spectroscopy, because interstellar lines are much narrower than those broadened by stellar rotation.|$|E
