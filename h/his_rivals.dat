5|$|Because of his soft-spoken demeanor, Day's accomplishments {{were not}} {{immediately}} recognized {{as opposed to}} other elite pitchers of the league like Satchel Paige. Nonetheless, Day {{is considered one of}} the best pitchers of the Negro leagues, equaling and sometimes surpassing the abilities of <b>his</b> <b>rivals.</b> In 1995, Day was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame, just six days before his death at 78 years old.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{benefiting from}} {{large numbers of}} {{campaign}} contributions from individual donors, and the efforts of tech-savvy supporters determined to keep his name a frequent topic of discussion on the internet, {{over the course of}} the campaign Paul was unable to translate the enthusiasm of his core supporters into large enough numbers of actual primary votes to unseat <b>his</b> <b>rivals.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to the U.S. Department of State and the DEA, Antonio Ezequiel was 6ft (1.83 m) tall, {{and weighed}} {{approximately}} 215lbs (97.5 kilos). He had an alternative {{date of birth}} on 5 May 1962. He had black-colored hair and brown eyes, and his aliases were Marcos Ledezma, El Licenciado (The Certified or The Lawyer), and Tony Tormenta (Tony the Storm), which he earned for his explosive personality and for beheading and torturing <b>his</b> <b>rivals.</b>|$|E
50|$|After {{pursuing}} <b>his</b> <b>rival</b> Pompey to Egypt, Caesar, recently victorious in a {{civil war}} closer to home, became entwined in the Alexandrine civil war after <b>his</b> <b>rival,</b> Pompey Magnus, was killed by King Ptolemy XIII in an attempt to please Caesar.|$|R

5|$|Bomar, of Vanderbilt, is only shaded {{a little}} by two other ends, largely through the {{experienced}} gained by <b>his</b> <b>rivals</b> against stronger opposition. He weighs 200 pounds, is tremendously fast, and a hardy, defensive player. On attack {{he is able}} to pick the forward pass out of the air on the full run, and, running with a high-knee action quite like that of the redoubtable Ted Coy, if he cannot get by his man, runs him down and goes on over him, still on his feet.|$|E
5|$|Eowa {{was killed}} at Maserfield along with Oswald, {{although}} on which side he fought is unknown. It {{may well be}} that he fought as a dependent ally of Oswald against Penda. If Eowa was in fact dominant among the Mercians during the period leading up to the battle, then his death could have marked what the author of the Historia Brittonum regarded as the beginning of Penda's ten-year reign. Thus it may be that Penda prevailed not only over the Northumbrians but also over <b>his</b> <b>rivals</b> among the Mercians.|$|E
5|$|He was {{generally}} more highly regarded for his batting than his wicket-keeping, often drawing criticism {{for the quality}} of his glovework. Despite this, he was at times considered to be a better wicket-keeper than two of <b>his</b> <b>rivals</b> for England; Bairstow and Buttler. Nonetheless, playing in an era when international teams did not play specialist wicket-keepers, Kieswetter's selection was based primarily upon his batting ability, rather than his keeping ability. For a couple of matches during 2012, he was used as an off spin bowler by Somerset, collecting three wickets.|$|E

5|$|Murphy {{has been}} outspoken about several other of <b>his</b> <b>rivals,</b> criticising them for having too many toilet breaks and {{complaining}} about table conditions among other things. Murphy also makes collective criticisms {{of his fellow}} professionals for not attending events and has branded other players' concerns over prize money as a joke. Murphy's harshest criticism has been reserved for Ronnie O'Sullivan. Murphy highlights what he perceives to be O'Sullivan's lack of professionalism.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} the {{resistance}} was to topple Somerset as Lord Protector, so that in 1549 it was feared by some that the Reformation would cease. The prayer book was the tipping point. But Lisle, now made Earl of Warwick, was made Lord President of the Privy Council and, ever the opportunist (he died a public Roman Catholic), he saw the further implementation of the reforming policy {{as a means of}} defeating <b>his</b> <b>rivals.</b>|$|E
5|$|Underwood {{is passed}} over for an {{appointment}} as United States Secretary of State {{even though he had}} been promised the position after ensuring the election of Colorado Governor Garrett Walker (Michel Gill) as President. Walker's Chief of Staff Linda Vasquez (Sakina Jaffrey) gives him this news prior to the January 2013 United States presidential inauguration. With the aid of Claire, and his fiercely loyal Chief of Staff Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly), Underwood uses his position as House Whip to seek retribution. He quickly allies with Washington Herald reporter Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara), whom he uses to undermine <b>his</b> <b>rivals</b> via the press.|$|E

5|$|Although the Battle of Pelagonia has {{frequently}} {{been described as}} a decisive turning point, Michael VIII Palaiologos' gains were rapidly reversed and <b>his</b> <b>rivals</b> quickly regained their strength, with both the Epirotes and Manfred of Sicily reclaiming most of the territories they had lost. Nevertheless, the effects of the battle were not wholly undone: Palaiologos' victory, gained with the assistance of John Doukas, not only prevented the Epirote–Latin league of 1259 from taking Thessalonica and much of Nicaea's European domains, but also provided a valuable breathing space in the lead-up to the eventual recovery of Constantinople in 1261, which led to the re-establishment of the Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologan dynasty.|$|E
5|$|As the Arabs customarily did not {{campaign}} during winter, Asad demobilized his men. On Harith's urging, on {{the other}} hand, the Turgesh khagan decided to launch a winter attack south of the Oxus, hoping to raise the local population in revolt against the Arabs. In this he was joined not only by Harith and his followers, but by {{the great majority of}} the native princes of Sogdiana and Tokharistan. Asad quickly mobilized his forces and managed to catch the khagan himself with a small part of his army and defeat them at Kharistan. Although both the khagan and Harith escaped capture, the Battle of Kharistan struck a blow to the khagans prestige, and Suluk's murder by <b>his</b> <b>rivals</b> a short while afterwards saved the Muslims from worse.|$|E
5|$|Béla {{separated}} from {{his wife in the}} first half of 1222 upon his father's demand. However, Pope Honorius refused to declare the marriage illegal. Béla accepted the Pope's decision and took refuge in Austria from his father's anger. He returned, together with his wife, only after the prelates had {{in the first half of}} 1223 persuaded his father to forgive him. Having returned to his Duchy of Slavonia, Béla launched a campaign against Domald of Sidraga, a rebellious Dalmatian nobleman, and captured Domald's fortress at Klis. Domald's domains were confiscated and distributed among <b>his</b> <b>rivals,</b> the Šubići, who had supported Béla during the siege.|$|E

5|$|During 1930, Allen again had {{leave in}} which he could play cricket, and was among the front-runners for {{a place in the}} England team. His first {{appearance}} of the season was for the MCC against the Australian touring team. Although he took four for 28 on the last day, <b>his</b> <b>rivals</b> for an England place were also successful. Playing for Middlesex against the Australians, Allen took six for 77 but was overlooked for the first Test at Trent Bridge, Nottingham. England won the match during the course of which Larwood, the incumbent fast bowler in the team, fell ill. Allen opted to play for Middlesex against Northamptonshire while the team for the second Test was being chosen, and took six for 77. His subsequent inclusion in the squad of 13 for that game was not particularly well received by the press.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} {{to the arrival of}} the Crusaders, the regent of Damascus, Mu'in ad-Din Unur, started making feverish preparations for war, strengthening the fortifications of Damascus, ordering troops to his city and having the water sources along the road to Damascus destroyed or diverted. Anur sought help from the Zangid rulers of Aleppo and Mosul (who were normally <b>his</b> <b>rivals),</b> though forces from these states did not arrive in time to see combat outside of Damascus. It is almost certain that the Zangid rulers delayed sending troops to Damascus out of the hope that their rival Anur might lose his city to the Crusaders.|$|E
5|$|Nasser's {{nomination}} {{for the post}} and the new constitution were put to public referendum on 23 June and each was approved by an overwhelming majority. A 350-member National Assembly was established, elections for which were held in July 1957. Nasser had ultimate approval over all the candidates. The constitution granted women's suffrage, prohibited gender-based discrimination, and entailed special protection {{for women in the}} workplace. Coinciding with the new constitution and Nasser's presidency, the RCC dissolved itself and its members resigned their military commissions as part of the transition to civilian rule. During the deliberations surrounding the establishment of a new government, Nasser began a process of sidelining <b>his</b> <b>rivals</b> among the original Free Officers, while elevating his closest allies to high-ranking positions in the cabinet.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Bhagavan cannot rest until he seeks out Jaidev for revenge. Firstly, Bhagavan kills Chotu (Ali), Jaidev's {{best friend and}} associate. Meanwhile, Sandhya gets kidnapped and taken to Kolkata. In a fit of rage at losing Chotu and Sandhya, Jaidev returns to Kolkata and starts hunting <b>his</b> <b>rivals.</b> He goes to Kulkarni's house with heavy {{ammunition}} and kills everyone except Kulkarni, as Jaidev promised {{him that he would}} not kill him. Kulkarni dies in his attempt to kill Jaidev. Later, Jaidev kills Guruvayya, as he gets information that Guruvayya was responsible for this saga. At last, Jaidev reaches Bhagavan, who actually kidnapped Sandhya.|$|E
5|$|The crowd roared in {{approval}} and Arab audiences were electrified. The assassination attempt backfired, quickly playing into Nasser's hands. Upon returning to Cairo, he ordered {{one of the}} largest political crackdowns in the modern history of Egypt, with the arrests of thousands of dissenters, mostly members of the Brotherhood, but also communists, and the dismissal of 140 officers loyal to Naguib. Eight Brotherhood leaders were sentenced to death, although the sentence of its chief ideologue, Sayyid Qutb, was commuted to a 15-year imprisonment. Naguib was removed from the presidency and put under house arrest, but was never tried or sentenced, and no one in the army rose to defend him. With <b>his</b> <b>rivals</b> neutralized, Nasser became the undisputed leader of Egypt.|$|E
5|$|The race began {{behind the}} safety car, {{and when the}} car {{returned}} to the pit lane Häkkinen built a comfortable lead over Jarno Trulli. As the track dried and <b>his</b> <b>rivals</b> made pit stops, Häkkinen maintained his lead until a lap-13 spin gave Michael Schumacher the lead {{for most of the}} remainder of the race. By the 34th lap Schumacher's tyres began to degrade; he drove off the racing line to cool them, which allowed Häkkinen to close the gap. On lap 41 Häkkinen overtook Michael Schumacher for the lead, lapping BAR driver Ricardo Zonta and maintaining the lead to win. Although Rubens Barrichello set the fastest lap time in the other Ferrari, he was hampered by a poor qualifying performance and retired with a fuel-pressure problem thirteen laps from the finish.|$|E
