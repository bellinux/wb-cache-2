5|$|Natural calcium is {{a mixture}} of five stable {{isotopes}} (40Ca, 42Ca, 43Ca, 44Ca, and 46Ca) and one isotope with a half-life so long that it can be considered stable for all practical purposes (48Ca, with a half-life of about 4.3×1019years). Calcium is the first (lightest) <b>element</b> <b>to</b> have six naturally occurring isotopes.|$|E

5|$|The {{detection}} uses {{pattern recognition}} of regular shapes (rectangles, circles, ellipses). The 3D {{model of the}} <b>element</b> <b>to</b> be inspected can be projected in the image plane for more complex shapes.

5|$|The first isotope of mendelevium, 256Md (half-life 87 min), was {{synthesized}} by Albert Ghiorso, Glenn T. Seaborg, Gregory R. Choppin, Bernard G. Harvey and Stanley G.

25|$|Glutamate receptors (GluRs) are {{localized}} to the postsynaptic density, and are {{anchored by}} cytoskeletal <b>elements</b> <b>to</b> the membrane. They are positioned directly above their signalling machinery, which is typically {{tethered to the}} underside of the plasma membrane, allowing signals transmitted by the GluRs into the cytosol to be further propagated by their nearby signalling <b>elements</b> <b>to</b> activate signal transduction cascades. The localization of signalling <b>elements</b> <b>to</b> their GluRs is particularly important in ensuring signal cascade activation, as GluRs would be unable to affect particular downstream effects without nearby signallers.|$|R
5|$|After having {{positioned}} {{to perform a}} visual inspection, the robot performs an acquisition with a pan-tilt-zoom camera. Several steps take place: pointing the camera, sensing the <b>element</b> <b>to</b> be inspected, if needed repointing and zooming with the camera, image acquisition and inspection. Image analysis is used on doors {{to determine whether they}} are open or closed; on {{the presence or absence of}} protection for certain equipment; the state of turbofan blades or the wear of landing gear tires.|$|E
5|$|At least 32 {{metastable}} isomers {{have been}} characterized, ranging in mass number from 164 to 197. The most stable {{of these is}} 192m2Ir, which decays by isomeric transition with a half-life of 241years, making it more stable than any of iridium's synthetic isotopes in their ground states. The least stable isomer is 190m3Ir with a half-life of only 2µs. The isotope 191Ir {{was the first one}} of any <b>element</b> <b>to</b> be shown to present a Mössbauer effect. This renders it useful for Mössbauer spectroscopy for research in physics, chemistry, biochemistry, metallurgy, and mineralogy.|$|E
5|$|Californium is a {{radioactive}} {{chemical element}} with symbol Cf and atomic number98. The element was first synthesized in 1950 at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (then the University of California Radiation Laboratory), by bombarding curium with alpha particles (helium-4 ions). It is an actinide element, the sixth transuranium <b>element</b> <b>to</b> be synthesized, {{and has the}} second-highest atomic mass of all the elements that have been produced in amounts large enough to see {{with the unaided eye}} (after einsteinium). The element was named after the university and the state of California.|$|E

5|$|Carbon is the 15th most {{abundant}} {{element in the}} Earth's crust, and the fourth {{most abundant}} element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon's abundance, its unique diversity of organic compounds, and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on Earth enables this <b>element</b> <b>to</b> serve as a common element of all known life. It {{is the second most}} abundant element in the human body by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Chronic {{health effects}} from {{volcanic}} ash fall are possible, as exposure to free crystalline silica {{is known to}} cause silicosis. Minerals associated with this include quartz, cristobalite and tridymite, which may all be present in volcanic ash. These minerals are described as ‘free’ silica as the SiO2 is not attached to another <b>element</b> <b>to</b> create a new mineral. However, magmas containing less than 58% SiO2 {{are thought to be}} unlikely to contain crystalline silica.|$|E

He also proposed using propylene glycol to dilute nicotine and placing it in a disposable plastic cartridge which serves as a liquid reservoir and mouthpiece.|$|E
