5|$|Following Gillibrand's win, Republicans quickly began speculating about {{possible}} 2008 candidates. Len Cutler, {{director of the}} Center for the Study of Government and Politics at Siena College, said that the seat {{would be difficult for}} Gillibrand to hold in 2008, noting Republicans substantially outnumbered <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> district.|$|E
5|$|Barkley {{supported}} U.S. neutrality in World War I and endorsed Wilson's plan {{to purchase}} merchant ships for the U.S. {{instead of paying}} foreign carriers to travel waters containing German U-boats. His position was popular in his district, as 80% of the dark tobacco grown in western Kentucky was sold overseas, and higher shipping costs adversely affected profits. The House authorized the purchase, but Republicans and conservative <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate regarded the idea as socialistic and blocked its passage with a filibuster.|$|E

5|$|Kennedy's role as {{a liberal}} lion in the Senate {{came to the fore}} in 1995, when the Republican Revolution took control and {{legislation}} intending to fulfill the Contract with America was coming from Newt Gingrich's House of Representatives. Many <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate and the country overall felt depressed but Kennedy rallied forces to combat the Republicans. By the beginning of 1996, the Republicans had overreached; most of the Contract had failed to pass the Senate and the Democrats could once again move forward with legislation, almost all of it coming out of Kennedy's staff.|$|E
5|$|McGovern {{announced}} his candidacy on January 18, 1971, during a televised speech {{from the studios}} of KELO-TV in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. At the time of his announcement, McGovern ranked fifth among Democrats in a presidential preference Gallup Poll. The earliest such entry since Andrew Jackson was designed to give him time to overcome the large lead of the front-runner, Maine Senator Edmund Muskie. Nevertheless, by January 1972, McGovern had only 3percent national support among <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gallup Poll and had not attracted significant press coverage.|$|E

5|$|While several Democratic {{candidates}} {{had prepared}} {{to enter the}} race, the field nearly cleared once Kennedy announced his candidacy. His family roots made him the overwhelming favorite among Massachusetts <b>Democrats.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> September 6 primary, he faced Rachel Brown, a Lyndon LaRouche acolyte; and Herb Robinson, an engineer and musician, winning the primary with 90 percent of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Ann Rivers (born 1968) is an American politician, who {{has served}} as a Republican member of the Washington State Senate since she was {{appointed}} to represent the 18th district in 2011, upon the resignation of Joe Zarelli. Prior to this {{she was a member of}} the Washington House of Representatives. In her first full term, a Majority Coalition Caucus was formed, taking control away from the <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state senate. Rivers was appointed to be majority whip for the session, a rare appointment for a freshman senator. She won re-election for another four-year term in 2012, with 67% of the vote against 32% for her opponent, Ralph Schmidt.|$|E
5|$|By 1877, {{differences}} with the Republican party leadership on the money question led him to consider other options. After initially supporting the Republican candidate for governor that year, Weaver joined the Greenback Party in August. In 1878, Weaver accepted the Greenback nomination for Iowa's 6th congressional district. Although Weaver's political career up to then had been as a staunch Republican, <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 6th district considered that endorsing him was likely {{the only way to}} defeat Ezekiel S. Sampson, the incumbent Republican. Despite objections from some hard-money Democrats, the Greenback-Democrat ticket prevailed, and Weaver was elected with 16,366 votes to Sampson's 14,307.|$|E

50|$|Doty ran for {{president}} as a <b>Democrat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1984 and 1988 elections. In 1988, when he spent approximately $20,000, he received 1,005 votes.|$|R
50|$|After {{losing the}} Democratic primary, James Kerby ran as an Independent <b>Democrat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general election, but {{received}} only token support, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> single digits.|$|R
5|$|Corzine, in {{attempting}} to pass his conceptual budget, came into conflict with fellow state <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> New Jersey General Assembly, particularly over their refusal to implement his proposed increase of the state's sales tax from 6% to 7% to fill a $4.5 billion budget gap. Corzine maintained that the gap could not be filled by any other means due to the state's constitution and a ruling of New Jersey's Supreme Court. Long before the deadline date, Corzine had stated {{that he would not}} accept a budget that did not include a sales tax increase. Due to Corzine's insistence, the state's General Assembly, which was dominated by Democrats, refused to pass a budget before the deadline.|$|E
5|$|<b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> General Assembly were outraged. When the 1930 {{legislative}} session convened, they immediately {{passed a bill}} that stripped Sampson of his power to appoint a highway commissioner, giving it to a three-person commission composed of the governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general. The Republican Sampson would be outnumbered and outvoted in this group. Confident that the Democrats would not lose another gubernatorial election, Democratic legislators stipulated in the bill that the appointment power {{would return to the}} governor in 1931, the end of Sampson's term. The law passed the House by a vote of 53—42 and the Senate by a vote of 22—15. Sampson vetoed the bill, but the veto was overridden, and Johnson was returned to his former position.|$|E
5|$|His {{popularity}} in the Northern states declined sharply after he supported the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which nullified the Missouri Compromise, while many whites in the South continued to support him. Passage of the act led to violent conflict over the expansion of slavery in the American West. Pierce's administration was further damaged when several of his diplomats issued the Ostend Manifesto, calling for the annexation of Cuba, a document which was roundly criticized. Although Pierce fully expected to be renominated by the <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1856 presidential election, he was abandoned by his party and his bid failed. His reputation in the North suffered further during the Civil War as he became a vocal critic of President Abraham Lincoln. Pierce, {{who had been a}} heavy drinker for much of his life, died of severe cirrhosis of the liver in 1869.|$|E
50|$|Elmore Wallace Hurst (December 6, 1851 - July 21, 1915) was a <b>Democrat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Illinois House of Representatives in 1888 {{and again}} in 1898.|$|R

5|$|In early 1974, {{the group}} Americans for Democratic Action rated Mathias {{the most liberal}} member of the GOP in the Senate based on twenty key votes in the 1973 {{legislative}} session. At 90 percent, his score was higher than most <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate, and was fourth highest amongst all members. Issues considered when rating senators included their positions on civil rights, mass transit, D.C. home rule, tax reform, and reducing overseas troop levels. The League of Women Voters gave Mathias a 100% on issues important to them, and the AFL-CIO agreed with Mathias on 32 out of 45 key labor votes. Conversely, the conservative group Americans for Constitutional Action stated Mathias agreed with their positions only 16% of the time.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1969, Biden ran as a Democrat for the New Castle County Council on {{a liberal}} {{platform}} that included support for public {{housing in the}} suburban area. He won by a solid, two-thousand vote margin in the usually Republican district and in a bad year for <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state. Even before taking his seat, he was already talking about running for the U.S. Senate {{in a couple of}} years. He served on the County Council from 1970 to 1972 while continuing his private law practice. Among issues he addressed on the council was his opposition to large highway projects that might disrupt Wilmington neighborhoods, including those related to Interstate 95.|$|E
5|$|Morehead was {{nominated}} for lieutenant governor at his party's nominating convention in Baltimore, Maryland in 1831, and was elected on a split ticket with Democratic governor John Breathitt. He ascended to the governorship upon Breathitt's death in 1834. Saddled with a shortened term, Morehead {{was not able to}} formulate a significant legislative agenda, and stuck to the politically safe issue of internal improvements during his term. When his party changed its name to the Whig Party and wrested control of the General Assembly from the <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer of 1834, Morehead hosted the new party's first nominating convention in Frankfort.|$|E
50|$|He ran for {{re-election}} in 1920, but was defeated by Republican Martin M. Higgins, with 1,206 to 2,185 for Higgins (there was no <b>Democrat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> race).|$|R
50|$|Carter ran for Pennsylvania's Fourth Congressional District in 1954. After a hard-fought victory <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Republican primary, he lost to {{incumbent}} Earl Chudoff, a <b>Democrat,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general election.|$|R
50|$|Gurley ran as a <b>Democrat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{election}} to represent Ward 4 on <b>the</b> Council <b>in</b> 2016. Brandon Todd ran for reelection. Leon Andrews and Ron Austin were also candidates.|$|R
5|$|Republican William S. Taylor {{defeated}} both Democratic {{candidates in}} the general election, but his margin over Goebel was only 2,383 votes. <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> General Assembly began making accusations of voting irregularities in some counties, but in a surprise decision, the Board of Elections created by the Goebel Election Law and manned by three hand-picked Goebel Democrats, ruled 2–1 that the disputed ballots should count, saying the law gave them no legal power to reverse the official county results and that under the Kentucky Constitution the power to review the election lay in the General Assembly. The Assembly then invalidated enough Republican ballots to give the election to Goebel. The Assembly's Republican minority was incensed, as were voters in traditionally Republican districts. For several days, the state hovered {{on the brink of}} a possible civil war.|$|E
5|$|Daniels {{announced}} {{his intention to}} run in Indiana's 2004 gubernatorial election after leaving the Bush administration. He won the Republican primary with 67% of the vote, and defeated Democratic incumbent Governor Joe Kernan in the general election. Daniels was reelected to a second term, defeating former U.S. Representative and US Department of Agriculture undersecretary Jill Long Thompson, on November 4, 2008. During his tenure as governor, Daniels cut the state government workforce by 18%, cut and capped state property taxes, and balanced the state budget through budget austerity measures and increasing spending by less than the inflation rate. In his second term, Daniels saw protest by labor unions and <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state legislature over his policies regarding Indiana's school voucher program and the Indiana House of Representatives attempt to pass right to work legislation, leading to the 2011 Indiana legislative walkouts. During the legislature's last session under Daniels, he signed the right-to-work law; with Indiana becoming the 23rd {{state in the nation}} to do so.|$|E
5|$|In May 1878, Weaver {{accepted}} the Greenback nomination for the House of Representatives in the 6th district. Although Weaver's political career up to then {{had been as}} a staunch Republican, <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 6th district thought that endorsing him was likely {{the only way to}} defeat Sampson, the incumbent Republican. Since the start of the Civil War, Democrats had been in the minority across Iowa; electoral fusion with Greenbackers represented their best chance to get their candidates into office. Hard-money Democrats objected to the idea, but some were reassured when HenryH. Trimble, a prominent Bloomfield Democrat, assured them that if elected Weaver would align with House Democrats on all issues other than the money question. Democrats declined to endorse any candidate at the 6th district convention, but soft-money leaders in the party circulated their own slate of candidates that included Democrats and Greenbackers. The Greenback–Democrat ticket prevailed, and Weaver was elected with 16,366 votes to Sampson's 14,307.|$|E
