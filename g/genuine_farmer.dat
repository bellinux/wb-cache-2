60|$|And now for {{my friend}} the hunting farmer in person, the sportsman whom I always regard {{as the most}} {{indispensable}} adjunct to the field, to whom I tender my spare cigar with the most perfect expression of my good will. His dress is nearly always the same. He wears a thick black coat, dark brown breeches, and top boots, very white in colour, or of a very dark mahogany, according to his taste. The hunting farmer of the old school generally rides in a chimney-pot hat; but, in this particular, the younger brethren of the plough are leaving their old habits, and running into caps, net hats, and other innovations which, I own, are somewhat distasteful to me. And there is, too, the ostentatious farmer, who rides in scarlet, signifying thereby that he subscribes his ten or fifteen guineas to the hunt fund. But here, in this paper, it is not of him I speak. He {{is a man who}} is so much less the farmer, in that he is the more an ordinary man of the ordinary world. The farmer whom we have now before us shall wear the old black coat, and the old black hat, and the white top boots, rather daubed in their whiteness; and he shall be the <b>genuine</b> <b>farmer</b> of the old school.|$|E
40|$|Adoption of {{integrated}} pest management(IPM) {{practices in the}} Guatemalan highlands has beenlimited {{by the failure of}} researchers andextensionists to promote <b>genuine</b> <b>farmer</b> participationin their efforts. Some attempts have been made toredress this failure in the diffusion-adoptionprocess, but farmers are still largely excluded fromthe research process. Understanding farmers'agricultural knowledge must be an early step toward amore participatory research process. With this inmind, we conducted a semi-structured survey of 75 Cakchiquel Maya farmers in Patzún, Guatemala, tobegin documenting their pest control practices. Theirresponses revealed that their understanding ofbiological and curative pest control is limited. However, their broad knowledge of cultural preventivepest control practices could explain why they hadfaced few pest problems in their traditional milpa (intercrop of corn, beans, and other edibleplants). The majority of these preventive practicesare probably efficient and environmentallyinnocuous...|$|E
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the ‘greening’ process of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) the demand for evaluation of actual agri-environmental measures (AEMs) calls for a deeper analysis of this policy instrument implementation. The idea behind this paper is that farmers’ willingness to participate is a necessary but not a sufficient condition in explaining the AEMs local uptake. Specifically, we test whether AEMs adoption depends both on farms and farmers’ characteristics, and on the local political and institutional framework, as well. Discriminating between <b>genuine</b> <b>farmer</b> incentive and attitude towards AEMs from the role played by the local institutional environment, appears a crucial step toward a better understanding of agri-environmental schemes. Empirical evidence conducted on the ‘universe’ of AEMs eligible farms located in Lombardy region gives substantial support to this hypothesis.

50|$|In 1938, the Legislature of Burma {{attempted}} {{to remedy the}} dispossession of rural Burmese farmers who were displaced by Indians, in particular, the Chettiars, by passing the Tenancy Act, Land Purchase Act, and Land Alienation Act. The Tenancy Act intended to safeguard tenants from eviction and to fix fair rents, while the Land Purchase Act allowed the government to purchase large swathes of land owned by non-agriculturalists to be resold on a tenancy basis to <b>genuine</b> <b>farmers.</b> In 1938, the Legislature passed into law the progressive University Act.|$|R
50|$|After the 2000 land redistribution, she {{requested}} {{and received}} a parliamentary written answer in January 2001 detailing beneficiaries. Including land rented out under the tenant farm scheme since 1990, {{only a handful of}} these, which range from very large farms to smallholdings, had been given to <b>genuine</b> <b>farmers.</b> According to her, the majority of state-owned commercial farms leased out under Zimbabwe's land resettlement programme had been given to well-connected individuals, most of whom are absentee landlords with no farming experience. Many of the new owners had been given leases for 98 years at advantageous prices, while others have yet to have their lease rates assessed.|$|R
60|$|With a yell, a real, <b>genuine</b> yell, <b>Farmer</b> Brown's boy awoke and sprang out of bed. For {{a minute}} he couldn't think where he was. Then {{with a sigh}} of relief he {{realized}} that he was safe in his own snug little room with the first Jolly Little Sunbeam creeping in at the window to wish him good morning and chide him for being such a lazy fellow. A thump and a scurry of little feet caught his attention, and he turned to see a Gray Squirrel running for the open window. It jumped up on the sill, looked out, then jumped down inside again, and ran over to a corner of the room, where he crouched as if in great fear. It was clear that he had been badly frightened by the yell of Farmer Brown's boy, and that he was still more frightened by something he had seen when he looked out of the window.|$|R

As one writer noted [...] "The publick would certainly have been gratified to know, that these extraordinary MSS. had been deemed <b>genuine</b> by Dr. <b>Farmer,</b> Messrs. Stevens or Malone; whose literary characters might have served as letters of credence." [...] Samuel Ireland later observed that he was [...] "of a different sentiment {{with regard to the}} sanction, which his Malone's inspection would afford them."

40|$|ENDURE Policy Brief No. 2 Main findings: 1. Consumer demand can {{evolve in}} favour of IPM. Educational campaigns {{in favour of}} relaxed visual {{standards}} and acceptance of varietal diversity on the shelf would create favourable conditions for the marketing of IPM-produced food. 2. Supermarket procurement strategies can contribute to reducing risks. They could {{go a long way}} towards achieving reduced reliance on pesticides and advanced forms of IPM if they were to include relaxed visual standards and acceptance of resistant varieties. 3. <b>Genuine</b> partnerships between <b>farmers,</b> buyers and suppliers based on a common interest in reducing dependence on pesticides are needed. Such partnerships would result in broad and sustained support for IPM from farmers, but would entail rewarding farmers for their efforts and ensuring their access to the advisory and monitoring support which is required for IPM...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} on the highlands of Ethiopia to identify and analyse the factors determining the adoption of environmental management measures. In 1985, Ethiopia was classified into low –and high-potential areas based on the suitability of the natural environment for rain-fed agriculture. To address these objectives, case study areas were selected from low-potential and high-potential areas randomly. Data were collected through face-to-face interview and key informants, focus group discussion and field observation. In the low-potential areas, the physical environment &# 8210; particularly soil and forest environments have shown substantial recovery. Similarly, the water environment has improved. However, in the high-potential areas sampled, these resources are still being degraded. Clear understanding of the benefits of soil conservation structures by farmers, active involvement and technical support from the government and full and <b>genuine</b> participation of <b>farmers</b> in communal environmental resources management activities were found to be main factors in the adoption of environmental management measures...|$|R
40|$|Mechanisation {{background}} and scope Farm production and rural transport require power. There are three main options: human work, animal {{power and the}} use of motors. The choice depends on local circumstances. Human, animal and machine power can complement each other in the same household, farm and village. Agricultural mechanisation involves the use of tools, implements and machines to improve the efficiency of human time and labour. The most appropriate machinery and power source for any operation depends on the work to be done and the relative desirability, affordability, availability and technical efficiency of the options. A hand hoe may be the best tool for intensive vegetable production. However, if much work needs to be done, human power alone is generally slow and tiring. Mechanisation, using animal or motor power, can significantly increase the productivity of human labour and {{improve the quality of life}} for women, men and children. Agricultural mechanisation is not an end in itself, but a means of development. The goal is sustainable and socially-beneficial agricultural production. The hardware is just one component of very complex farming systems. A wide range of social, economic and ecological factors determine whether a technology is practicable, beneficial and sustainable in an area. Sometimes mechanisation is confused with motorisation and tractorisation. Tractor power is just one option. In sub-Saharan Africa, some of the most successful mechanisation introductions have used animal power. In the CTA seminar and in this report, mechanisation is understood to encompass a range of technologies, using human, animal or motor power. The present levels of the various forms of agricultural mechanisation in Africa can only be estimated. It is widely acknowledged that most agricultural work (perhaps 80 %) depends entirely on human labour. Animals may perform up to 20 % of the operations, while in tropical Africa tractors contribute only a small proportion of the total agricultural work. During the last decade, structural adjustment programmes have changed the economic environment of African agriculture. Changing prices, currency values, government services and policies have affected the profitability of agriculture in both smallholder and large-scale production systems. The conditions for profitable distributing and repairing agricultural equipment have also changed. In many countries, farmers have appealed to development programmes and governments for assistance with farm power and mechanisation. In some areas, farmers have demonstrated there is a clear economic demand for animal power tractors. In other areas, such mechanisation remains a dream, being economically unsustainable in present circumstances. Government services involved in the development of agricultural mechanisation have suffered from cuts in the national budgets. Some of their activities have been criticised for not generating sustainable effects. Although 6 Integrating mechanisation into strategies for sustainable agriculture mechanisation can clearly influence production and the evolution of agricultural systems, its role in national development strategies has often been poorly defined. In 1996,CTA commissioned a study of mechanisation experiences in Africa that was undertaken in association with FAO by Dominique Bordet and Rabezandrina. The analysis started with the following key observations: Public-sector tractor hire services have failed throughout Africa. Private sector tractors have been profitable on large landholdings: tractors have seldom proved viable for the smallholder sector, whether in individual or group ownership or in private hire services. The devaluation of currencies has dramatically increased the price of tractors relative to the value of harvested produce. Tractors and machinery supplied under aid programmes have often been unhelpful, being inappropriate unsustainable. They have diverted the work of agricultural engineering departments from more appropriate, sustainable technologies. Artisans (blacksmiths) have been largely ignored as agricultural machinery (such as animal-drawn plows and cultivators) has been imported or made in centralised workshops. Supply of equipment has been determined largely by public sector organisations and not by the <b>genuine</b> demand of <b>farmers.</b> Research has been top-down and given insufficient consideration to the social, economic and environmental realities of African farming systems.
