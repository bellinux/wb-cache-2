40|$|SummaryBackgroundPolar <b>ejection</b> <b>forces</b> {{have often}} been {{hypothesized}} to guide directional instability of mitotic chromosomes, but a direct link has never been established. This has led, in part, to the resurgence of alternative theories. By taking advantage of extremely precise femtosecond pulsed laser microsurgery, we abruptly alter the magnitude of polar <b>ejection</b> <b>forces</b> by severing vertebrate chromosome arms. ResultsReduction of polar <b>ejection</b> <b>forces</b> increases the amplitude of directional instability without altering other characteristics, thus establishing a direct link between polar <b>ejection</b> <b>forces</b> and the direction of chromosome movements. We find that polar <b>ejection</b> <b>forces</b> limit the range of chromosome oscillations by increasing the probability that motors at a leading kinetochore abruptly disengage or turn off, leading to a direction reversal. ConclusionsFrom {{the relation between the}} change in oscillation amplitude and the amount a chromosome arm is shortened, we are able to map the distribution of polar <b>ejection</b> <b>forces</b> across the spindle, which is surprisingly different from previously assumed distributions. These results allow us to differentiate between the mechanisms proposed to underlie the directional instability of chromosomes...|$|R

Here {{we use a}} combination of quantitative live-cell imaging and reconstituted dynamic microtubule assays to investigate the molecular control of mitotic centromere movements. We establish that Kif 18 A (kinesin- 8) attenuates centromere movement by directly promoting microtubule pausing in a concentration-dependent manner. This activity provides the dominant mechanism for restricting centromere movement to the spindle midzone. Furthermore, polar <b>ejection</b> <b>forces</b> spatially confine chromosomes via position-dependent regulation of kinetochore tension and centromere switch rates. We demonstrate that polar <b>ejection</b> <b>forces</b> are antagonistically modulated by chromokinesins. These pushing forces depend on Kid (kinesin- 10) activity and are antagonized by Kif 4 A (kinesin- 4), which functions to directly suppress microtubule growth.

Here, {{we describe the}} functional characterization of a novel spindle protein, termed “CHICA,” that was originally identified in a proteomic survey of the human spindle apparatus [1]. We show that CHICA localizes to the mitotic spindle and is both upregulated and phosphorylated during mitosis. CHICA-depleted cells form shorter spindles and fail to organize a proper metaphase plate, highly reminiscent of the phenotype observed upon depletion of the chromokinesin Kid, a key mediator of polar <b>ejection</b> <b>forces</b> [2 – 6].

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} changes in left ventricular (LV) filling, left atrial (LA) volumes and function six months after nonsurgical septal reduction therapy (NSRT) for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). BACKGROUNDPatients with HOCM frequently have enlarged left atria, which predisposes them to atrial fibrillation. Nonsurgical septal reduction therapy results in significant reduction in left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction and symptomatic improvement. However, its effect on LV passive filling volume, LA volumes and function is not yet known. METHODSThirty patients with HOCM underwent treadmill exercise testing as well as 2 -dimensional and Doppler echocardiography before and six months after NSRT. Data included clinical status, exercise duration, LVOT gradient, mitral regurgitant (MR) volume, LV pre-A pressure and LA volumes. Left atrial <b>ejection</b> <b>force</b> and kinetic energy (KE) were computed noninvasively and were compared with 12 age-matched, normal subjects. RESULTSNew York Heart Association (NYHA) class was lower and exercise duration was longer (p < 0. 05) six months after NSRT. The LVOT gradient, MR volume and LV pre-A pressure were all significantly reduced. HOCM patients had larger atria, which had a higher <b>ejection</b> <b>force</b> and KE, compared with normal subjects (p < 0. 01). After NSRT, LV passive filling volume increased (p < 0. 01), whereas LA volumes, <b>ejection</b> <b>force</b> and KE decreased (p < 0. 01). Reduction in LA maximal volume was positively related to changes in LV pre-A pressure (r = 0. 8, p < 0. 05) and MR volume (0. 4, p < 0. 05). Changes in LA <b>ejection</b> <b>force</b> were positively related to changes in LA pre-A volume (r = 0. 7, p < 0. 01) and KE (r = 0. 81, p < 0. 01).

Our data showed that the progressive shortening of atrioventricular delay induced a gradual increase in early peak velocity (median value 46 to 53 to 61. 5 cm/sec, respectively, at 200, 150, and 100 msec intervals) and a gradual decrease in isovolumic relaxation time (median 92. 6 to 81. 5 to 69. 7 msec at 200, 150, and 100 msec, respectively), atrial peak velocity (59 to 52 to 44. 5 cm/sec at 200, 150, and 100 msec, respectively), atrial filling fraction (50. 5 % to 40 % to 23. 5 % at 200, 150, and 100 msec, respectively), and atrial <b>ejection</b> <b>force</b> (17. 2 to 14. 7 to 8. 5 kilodynes at 200, 150, and 100 msec, respectively).

We aimed to establish gestation-specific reference intervals for ventricular <b>ejection</b> <b>force</b> (VEF) from 12 to 40 weeks of pregnancy. Material and Methods:? In a cross-sectional observational study of singleton pregnancies, examinations were performed in 236 women evenly distributed across each week of pregnancy from 12 to 40 weeks. Each mother was scanned once. For the aortic and pulmonary valves, the time to peak velocity (TPV) and the average (TAV) and peak flow velocity in systole (PSV) was measured. For each we averaged values from three consecutive complexes. The outlet valve diameters were measured and the VEF on both {{the right and left}} sides were calculated using the formula VEF = (1. 055 × valve area × time to peak velocity × TAV) × (PSV/TPV) where 1. 055 represents the density of blood. Measurements were repeated in 40 women to assess intraobserver reproducibility and in 19 women for interobserver variability. Results:? We present reference intervals for right and left VEF. We demonstrated that the ventricular force on both right and left sides increases with advancing gestational age. Conclusion:? Fetal cardiac physiology can be studied and Doppler indices reliably measured as early as the late first trimester of pregnancy.

These coefficients, together with the modeled <b>ejection</b> <b>forces,</b> are used in free-stream state-space equations of motion to predict the store trajectory. The results are compared with the Nielson Engineering and Research (NEAR) store separation code which provides accurate trajectory profiles, for speeds below the critical speed, by use of a vortex-lattice and panel method. Modification of the Missile DATCOM aerodynamic coefficients provides single-point state-space prediction of the store pitch trajectory within 30 % of the NEAR code results. Store trajectories were restricted to the first 0. 2 seconds of free flight. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Kid is a kinesin-like DNA-binding protein {{known to}} be {{involved}} in chromosome movement during mitosis, although its actual motor function has not been demonstrated. Here, we describe the initial characterization of Kid as a microtubule-based motor using optical trapping microscopy. A bacterially expressed fusion protein consisting of a truncated Kid fragment (amino acids 1 – 388 or 1 – 439) is indeed an active microtubule motor with an average speed of ∼ 160  nm/s, and the polarity of movement is plus end directed. We could not detect processive movement of either monomeric Kid or dimerizing chimeric Kid; however, low levels of processivity (a few steps) cannot be detected with our method. These results are consistent with Kid having a role in chromosome congression in vivo, where it would be responsible for the polar <b>ejection</b> <b>forces</b> acting on the chromosome arms...|$|R
40|$|Chromosome bi-orientation occurs after {{conversion}} of initial lateral attachments between kinetochores and spindle microtubules into stable end-on attachments near the cell equator. After bi-orientation, chromosomes experience tension from spindle forces, which {{plays a key}} role in the stabilization of correct kinetochore-microtubule attachments. However, how end-on kinetochore-microtubule attachments are first stabilized in the absence of tension remains a key unanswered question. To address this, we generated Drosophila S 2 cells undergoing mitosis with unreplicated genomes (SMUGs). SMUGs retained single condensed chromatids that attached laterally to spindle microtubules. Over time, laterally attached kinetochores converted into end-on attachments and experienced intra-kinetochore stretch/structural deformation, and SMUGs eventually exited a delayed mitosis with mono-oriented chromosomes after satisfying the spindle-assembly checkpoint (SAC). Polar <b>ejection</b> <b>forces</b> (PEFs) generated by Chromokinesins promoted the conversion from lateral to end-on kinetochore-microtubule attachments that satisfied the SAC in SMUGs. Thus, PEFs convert lateral to stable end-on kinetochore-microtubule attachments, independently of chromosome bi-orientation...|$|R
