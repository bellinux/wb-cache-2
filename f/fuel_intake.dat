40|$|The {{stratification}} of in-cylinder mixtures {{appears to}} be an effective method for managing the combustion process in controlled auto-ignition (CAI) engines. Stratification can be achieved and controlled using various injection strategies such as split fuel injection and the introduction of a portion of fuel directly before the start of combustion. This study investigates the effect of injection timing and the amount of fuel injected for stratification on the combustion and emissions in CAI engine. The experimental research was performed on a single cylinder engine with direct gasoline injection. CAI combustion was achieved using negative valve overlap and exhaust gas trapping. The experiments were performed at constant engine <b>fueling.</b> <b>Intake</b> boost was applied to control the excess air ratio. The results show that the application of the late injection strategy has a significant effect on the heat release process. In general, the later the injection is and the more fuel is injected for stratification, the earlier the auto-ignition occurs. However, the experimental findings reveal that the effect of stratification on combustion duration is much more complex. Changes in combustion are reflected in NOX emissions. The attainable level of stratification is limited by the excessive emission of unburned hydrocarbons, CO and soot...|$|R

50|$|With {{hindsight}} it can {{be considered}} East Germany's response to West Germany's 'Peoples Car', the VW Beetle. Its purpose {{was to provide a}} cheap but still reliable car that was very affordable and also easy to repair and maintain. Still, it was {{at the time of its}} release rather modern in many ways, with front wheel drive, a low maintenance engine, unitary construction, composite bodywork and independent suspension all around. The main letdown was the pre-war DKW based engine that was competitive when launched, but from the late 1950s into the 1960s, small economy cars in western countries that used two-stroke engines, were replaced with cleaner and more efficient four-stroke engines, as employed from the start in the Volkswagen Beetle. Two-stroke engines of this sort, with crankcase scavenging and lubricating oil provided during <b>fuel</b> <b>intake,</b> burn their lubricating oil by design and produce smoky tailpipe emissions. However, two-stroke engines were also to be found in cars like the Western German Auto Union 1000 that ended production in 1963, and the Swedish Saab 96 that changed to four-stroke in 1967. The lack of development funds in East Germany forced the continued use of a two-stroke engine in the Trabant, thus causing this vehicle to become obsolescent in the 1960s and extremely obsolete by the 1980s.|$|E

40|$|The {{analyses}} of ultraendurance athletes have provided {{new insights into}} the limits of human performance capacity and into medical complications when going beyond the physical limits. Ultradistance running poses a unique stress on the athlete. In their Viewpoint, Millet et al. (3) argued that determinants of performance in ultraendurance are subjected to a compromise between two main parameters: energy cost and lower limb tissue injury. The latter results from a complex combination of extrinsic factors (training errors including lack of specific strength, inappropriate footwear, inappropriate running surface, and terrain) and intrinsic factors (poor flexibility, biomechanical lower extremity malalignment, anthropometry, previous injury, running experience). Concerning the former, environmental conditions, training, and perhaps most importantly fluid and <b>fuel</b> <b>intake</b> all contribute to energy balance state and so race performance. In fact, nutrient intake during ultradistance races {{has been found to be}} below the estimated energy cost (1). Despite a low relative intensity the energy cost of running (expressed in mlO 2) is increased during ultradistance trail running races (2) compared with level running. This induces a marked negative energy balance state that was shown to reduce serum leptin concentrations during ultramarathon race (5). Thus suboptimal nutrition certainly would result in decreased performance under these circumstances. Finally, it is proposed that the most important factor linking both parameters explaining ultramarathon tolerance is the eccentric load of long-term running causing an association between skeletal muscle damage and impaired renal function through dehydration, rhabdomyolysis, and hemolysis (4) further exacerbated without optimal nutrition intake. 3. 484 JCR (2012) Q 1, 7 / 84 Sport sciences; Q 2, 20 / 80 PhysiologyUE...|$|E
40|$|Large bore {{two-stroke}} {{natural gas}} engines are facing more stringent emission regulations {{in the near}} future. In order to comply with these new regulations, engine manufacturers have to modify their engines. Redesigning some relevant parts and/or modifications to the combustion setup of these engines are in order. A deeper understanding and analysis of {{all the details of}} the combustion process could help researchers/engineers in these modifications. While the experimental methods are still the primary way of analyzing internal combustion engines, recent advances in numerical methods, and the computing power of clusters (supercomputers) have opened a new path ahead of engine designers. Using numerical tools could significantly reduce the costs associated with engine modifications. Three-dimensional CFD tools are the most accurate and detailed numerical tools available for engine research. CFD simulations of engines could reveal all the details of all the processes that happen in an engine: the air and <b>fuel</b> <b>intake,</b> mixing of the two, scavenging process, and the power cycle are some of the processes that could be looked into, using CFD tools. The current study represents the numerical simulation of a large bore natural gas engine, using a commercial CFD software package, along with the required experimental study to validate the results of the simulation work. This document includes the case setup process for the numerical simulation, which includes the simulation of the reed valve (the air/fuel ratio control system of the engine), the simulation of the scavenging process, the simulation of the combustion process, and the conjugate heat transfer simulation between the solid parts of the engine and the cooling system. The study of conjugate heat transfer -which is the main objective of this research- provides researchers with the spatial temperature distribution on all the parts surrounding the combustion chamber. The results show relatively higher temperatures near and around the spark plug and the air-start cavity. These results could be used for an improved mechanical design of relevant parts, and redesign of parts and/or combustion/cooling setup to reduce the emission production. The simulation results were all validated by experimental data. Stuffing box pressure, in-cylinder pressure, and equivalence ratio of the stuffing box mixture were the validation criteria for the numerical results. In addition, a single temperature measurement in the solid parts was used for partial validation of the CHT simulations.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a closed-loop controller for use on a Controlled-Auto- Ignition (CAI) / Spark-Ignition (SI) mixed mode engine equipped with a variable-valve-timing (VVT) mechanism. The controller in this study was designed only for use in the CAI regime. Operation in the SI regime and control of transitions between the CAI and SI modes were considered to be outside the scope of this study. The first part of the study involved creating an open-loop feedforward controller. This controller transformed desired engine output into required input based on a mapping of the steady-state output-to-input transfer function at constant engine speed and intake manifold temperature. Since the mapping domain was limited, the open-loop controller did not compensate for changes in operating conditions. This controller was used to study the transient response of the engine. Using the transient data, a mathematical representation of the engine output; i. e. mean effective pressure (MEP) and fuel-air equivalence ratio (), its in-cylinder state; i. e. mass of fuel, mass of air, percent mass exhaust gas residual and pressure, and input to the engine; i. e. mass of <b>fuel,</b> <b>intake</b> valve closing and exhaust valve closing, was developed. This representation showed that the CAI engine is effectively a quasi-static system in that the output of any given cycle depends almost entirely on the in-cylinder state at the start of that cycle, and that the latter depends almost entirely on prior cycle input. The quasi-static nature of the CAI engine effectively defined the architecture of the closed-loop controller; namely, a feedforward and feedback sub-controllers. A numerical model of the CAI engine and a closed-loop control system were developed. (cont.) A comparison of output from the model and engine showed excellent correlation. The model was then used to determine the gains of the closed-loop controller. Validation of the closed-loop controller consisted of comparing output from the CAI engine subject to closed-loop control to both the desired output and output from the engine subject to open-loop control. Visual cycle- by-cycle and statistical comparisons showed that the performance of the CAI engine improved significantly when subject to closed-loop control. This was especially true when the environmental and operating parameters not included in the original feedforward mapping; i. e. engine speed and intake manifold temperature, were allowed to vary. by Jeffrey A.
