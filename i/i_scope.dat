The program also heightened public awareness by supporting and promoting public discussions among high-level policy makers about SME development.

40|$|The idea {{of using}} {{visualization}} technology to enhance the understanding of abstract concepts, like data structures and algorithms, has become widely accepted. Several {{attempts have been made}} to introduce a system that levels out the burden of creating new visualizations. However, one of the main obstacles to fully taking advantage of algorithm visualization seems to be the time and effort required to design, integrate and maintain the visualizations. Effortlessness in the context of algorithm visualization is a highly subjective matter including many factors. Thus, we first introduce a taxonomy to characterize effortlessness in algorithm visualization systems. We have identified three main categories based on a survey conducted among CS educators: <b>i)</b> <b>scope,</b> i. e. how wide is the context one can apply the system to ii) integrability, i. e., how easy it is to take in use by a third party, and iii) interaction techniques, i. e., how well does the system support different use cases regularly applied by educators. We will conclude that generic and effortless visualization systems are needed. Such a system, however, needs to combine a range of characteristics implemented in many current AV systems...|$|E

40|$|Enhancer-dependent {{transcription}} {{involving the}} pro-moter specificity factor 54 is widely distributed amongst bacteria and {{commonly associated with}} cell envelope function. For transcription initiation, 54 -RNA polymerase yields open promoter complexes through its remodelling by cognate AAA+ ATPase ac-tivators. Since activators can be bypassed in vitro, bypass transcription in vivo could {{be a source of}} emergent gene expression along evolutionary path-ways yielding new control networks and transcrip-tion patterns. At a single test promoter in vivo by-pass transcription was not observed. We now use genome-wide transcription profiling, genome-wide mutagenesis and gene over-expression strategies in Escherichia coli, to (<b>i)</b> <b>scope</b> the range of bypass transcription in vivo and (ii) identify genes which might alter bypass transcription in vivo. We find lit-tle evidence for pervasive bypass transcription in vivo with only a small subset of 54 promoters func-tioning without activators. Results also suggest no one gene limits bypass transcription in vivo, argu-ing bypass transcription is strongly kept in check. Promoter sequences subject to repression by 54 were evident, indicating loss of rpoN (encoding 54) rather than creating rpoN bypass alleles would be one evolutionary route for new gene expression pat-terns. Finally, cold-shock promoters showed unusual 54 -dependence in vivo not readily correlated with conventional 54 binding-sites...|$|E

40|$|The Microwave Anisotropy Probe and Planck {{missions}} {{will provide}} low noise {{maps of the}} temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). These maps will allow measurement of the power spectrum of the CMB with measurement noise below cosmic variance for ℓ < 1500. It is anticipated that no further all sky CMB temperature observations will be needed after Planck. There are, however, other CMB measurements for which Planck will be not the end but the beginning. Following Planck, precise CMB polarization observations will offer the potential to study physical processes at energies as high as 10 19 GeV. In addition, arcminute scale, multi-frequency observations will allow study of the early phases of the formation of large-scale structure in the universe. – 2 – <b>I.</b> <b>Scope</b> of Report The Cosmic Microwave Background Future Missions Working Group (the authors of this report) was created by NASA headquarters to consider new missions to follow a successful Planck mission.

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to suggest that there are better concepts in which to conduct that debate, concepts of normative features to which scope is secondary. These are the features of what I call Normative Focus. They are formal features and it is for that reason that, expressing something of their nature in terms of the logic of modal operators, we have mistakenly thought they can be entirely expressed in those terms. We shall see limitations of scope contrasted with better description in terms of Normative Focus. Some authors have addressed such limitations by extending what they mean by <b>scope.</b> <b>I</b> show that <b>scope</b> is still not doing the work for them; what does it is their elicitation of our tacit knowledge of Normative Focus. Finally, <b>I</b> show that <b>scope</b> cannot capture Normative Focus because scope allows us to make only one distinction where we need to make three.

Journal of Environmental Policy & Planning, 13 (1), 23 - 47, Article Number: PII 935334210. The {{involvement}} of the public in decision-making is established as a key feature of many planning policies. However, there is evidence from the literature of a prevailing gap between participation rhetoric on paper and participation at the operational level. We assess whether {{this is also the}} case with landscape policy and review landscape characterization and assessment initiatives in England, Norway, Slovakia and Malta, focusing on five dimensions of good practice: (<b>i)</b> <b>scope</b> of public participation, (ii) representativeness of those involved, (iii) timeliness of public involvement, (iv) extent to which participation is rendered comfortable and convenient for the public, and (v) eventual influence of public input on decisions. Reviewed reporting results indicate weaknesses in the implementation of public participation, with public involvement largely limited to consultation, with few efforts to ensure representativeness of participants, with predominantly late {{involvement of}} the public, and with limited influence of the public on outputs. Furthermore, few efforts appear to be made to facilitate participation for the public. Although the cases studied differ, none of them are fully satisfactory in relation to the European Landscape Convention's participatory targets. The reporting of public participation processes thus suggests that practices may fail to match the rhetoricPeer reviewe...|$|E

We demonstrate MOTEHUNTER, a tool designed to support searching for such lost motes. It uses a directional antenna, a digital compass, and RSSI measurement, and provides a Java GUI to assist field work. It {{can be used to}} search for any mote compliant with IEEE 802. 15. 4, although a special small-footprint software component can be integrated with the mote’s application to improve the search process. MOTEHUNTER is described in more detail in our companion paper accepted for SENSEAPP 2012. Index Terms—Demonstration, {{wireless sensor network}}s, realworld deployments, localization, IEEE 802. 15. 4. the distance of a meter in high grass. Barely visible — as it is known to many WSN researchers. MOTEHUNTER is a tool developed to search for these lost motes, supporting WSN researchers in their field work.

All measurements were performed using 0 &deg;, 90 &deg; and &pi;/ 4 laminates. A survey was also {{made of the}} existing data showing the effects of temperature and moisture content on the tensile strength of different composites. <b>I.</b> <b>SCOPE</b> HE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES of composite materials may suffer when the Tmaterial is exposed to high temperature, high humidity environments. There-fore, in order to utilize the full potential of composite materials, their performance at elevated temperatures and at high moisture contents must be known. The objec-tive {{of this investigation was}} to evaluate the changes in the {{ultimate tensile}} strengths of composite materials exposed to air in which the relative humidity varied from 0 to 100 percent and the temperature ranged from 200 K to 450 K. The changes in the ultimate tensile strengths were assessed a) by performing tensile tests on Thornel 300 /Fiberite 1034 graphite epoxy composites using 0 °, 7 r/ 4, and 90 ° lay-ups and b) by summarizing the existing data and comparing them to the present results.
