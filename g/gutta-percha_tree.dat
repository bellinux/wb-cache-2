"At {{the bottom}} of the basket were some curiously-shaped green leaves, rather like the leaves of the <b>gutta-percha</b> <b>tree</b> in shape, only {{somewhat}} thicker and of a more fleshy substance. As though by hazard, the girl picked one of these leaves out of the basket and smelt it. Then she handed it to me. I took the leaf, and supposing that she wished me to smell it also, was about to oblige her by doing so, when my eye fell upon some curious red scratches on the green surface of the leaf.|$|E

Ali controlled the export of rice, beeswax, coffee, and products extracted from Almaciga and <b>Gutta-percha</b> <b>trees.</b> Ali held a grudge against the Americans when they refused to let him travel to the US. Ali retreated deep into the Cotabato Valley.|$|R

Schlenzig established a new Ramu station that was later connected by a bridle track to the coast. Dr R. Schlecter led another expedition in 1902 in search of <b>gutta-percha</b> <b>trees.</b> Then in 1907, Austrian explorer Wilhelm Dammk√∂hler led an expedition up the Markham Valley and linked {{the headwaters of the}} Markham River with the Ramu for the first time.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Plants {{containing}} compounds {{such as the}} isoflavonoids, {{with female}} hormone-like effects that bind to human estrogen receptors, are known. But none has been previously shown to have corresponding male hormone-like effects that interact with the human androgen receptor. Here, we report that the tree bark (cortex) of the <b>Gutta-Percha</b> <b>tree</b> Eucommia ulmoides possesses bimodal phytoandrogenic and hormone potentiating effects by lipidic components. Methods The extracts of E. ulmoides were tested using in-vitro reporter gene bioassays and in-vivo animal studies. Key compounds responsible for the steroidogenic effects were isolated and identified using solid phase extraction (SPE), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), thin layer chromatography (TLC), gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), electron spray ionisation-mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Results The following bioactivities of E. ulmoides were found: (1) a phenomenal tripartite synergism exists between the sex steroid receptors (androgen and estrogen receptors), their cognate steroidal ligands and lipidic augmenters isolated from E. ulmoides, (2) phytoandrogenic activity of E. ulmoides was mediated by plant triterpenoids binding cognately to the androgen receptor (AR) ligand binding domain. Conclusion In addition to well-known phytoestrogens, the existence of phytoandrogens is reported in this study. Furthermore, a form of tripartite synergism between sex steroid receptors, sex hormones and plant-derived lipids is described for the first time. This could have contrasting clinical applications for hypogonadal- and hyperlipidaemic-related disorders. </p...|$|E
50|$|On {{arrival at}} Cooper's Creek, Burke {{decided to make}} a dash for the Gulf with Wills, Charles Gray and John King, before the wet season set in. This {{northern}} party was made up of Burke as party leader, Wills as second-in-command and astronomer, navigator and meteorologist, King as attendant to the party's camels, and Gray as camp organizer.Following a line to the northeast of Stuart's proposed track, Burke and his team arrived at the Little Bynoe River on 11 February 1861. They were 57 days out from Cooper's Creek and 13 days over the planned time. Burke and Wills' Camp B/CXIX became the most northern of their camps as mangroves blocked further progress to the Gulf. As they were running low on stores and concerned about meeting the remainder of the exploration party at Cooper's Creek, Burke and Wills left Gray and King at Camp B/CXIX and pushed further north through the mangroves in an attempt to reach the Gulf of Carpentaria coast. However, after three days of difficult travel, they returned south picking up Gray and King at Camp B/CXIX. The explorers left little evidence of their stay on the Gulf except for 15 blazed Coolibah and <b>Gutta-percha</b> <b>trees.</b>|$|R
