50|$|A muscle's {{moment arm}} {{is defined as}} the {{perpendicular}} distance from the muscle's line of action to the joint's center of rotation. As a general rule, the larger the moment arm of a muscle, the greater torque it can produce with the same amount of force. At the same time, the muscle would cause a smaller change in joint angle for the same amount of length change. As an example, <b>holding</b> a <b>wrench</b> {{at the very end of}} the handle (point B) makes it easier to loosen a bolt, however, requires your hand to travel a greater distance compared to <b>holding</b> the <b>wrench</b> closer to the bolt (point A). Although both the cheetah and greyhound are similar in size, the cheetah can attain speeds nearly twice as fast as the greyhound. This can be explained partly by the finding that moment arms of muscles at the knee and ankle joint in the cheetah are proportionally larger than those of the greyhound. A similar comparison can be made between two similar species of lizards. It was found that geckoes more adapted for climbing have greater hip and shoulder retractor moment arms. Geckoes adapted for horizontal locomotion have greater knee and ankle extensor moment arms.|$|R
60|$|With {{the shock}} of the impact the club fell from the brute's hand and Tarzan's <b>hold</b> was <b>wrenched</b> from its throat. Instantly the two were locked in a deathlike embrace. Though the {{creature}} bit at Tarzan the latter was quickly aware {{that this was not a}} particularly formidable method of offense or defense, since its canines were scarcely more developed than his own. The thing that he had principally to guard against was the sinuous tail which sought steadily to wrap itself about his throat and against which experience had afforded him no defense.|$|R

5000|$|... "Gargantua the Great, wrote Gargantuan Columnist Heywood Broun {{three weeks}} ago, [...] "is the fiercest looking thing I {{have ever seen}} on two legs. And {{probably}} his power and truculence were all the more impressive because he did look a good deal like a distant relative. No one was allowed to go close to his cage, because Gargantua can reach about five feet through the bars and get a toe hold on a visitor whom he dislikes." [...] Gargantua {{may not be the}} world's biggest captive gorilla—since the death of Berlin Zoo's monster, many zoos have claimed that honor for their gorillas—but {{he is one of the}} most vindictive. Last week the circus' executive vice president, young John Ringling North, nephew of the late John ("Three-Ring") Ringling, was inspecting the circus' Sarasota, Fla. winter quarters. Imprudently disregarding warning signs, he leaned against the bars of Gargantua's cage to rest. Gargantua reached through, got no toe <b>hold</b> but <b>wrenched</b> Circusman North's left arm into the cage, bit & wrung it until Trainer Richard Kroner, pounding the gorilla with an iron stake, distracted its slow attention.|$|R
