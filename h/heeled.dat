5|$|Bayern and Baden were {{regarded}} as exceptional sea boats by the German navy. Bayern and her sisters were stable and very maneuverable. The ships suffered slight speed loss in heavy seas; with the rudders hard over, the ships lost up to 62% speed and <b>heeled</b> over 7degrees. With a metacentric height of , larger than that of their British equivalents, the vessels were stable gun platforms for the confined waters of the North Sea.|$|E
5|$|After {{her return}} to International Mercantile Marine (IMM), the ship {{underwent}} a refit at the W. & A. Fletcher Marine Works yard in Hoboken that outfitted her for 242 first-, 310 second-, and 876 third-class passengers. On 8 January 1920, while Kroonland was still under repair, the American Line ship , berthed next {{to her at the}} Fletcher yard, caught fire. In the multi-alarm fire, firefighters believed that St. Louis was a lost cause, and so focused their efforts on saving Kroonland. At one point, St. Louis <b>heeled</b> over and leaned on Kroonland but the only resulting damages were scorch marks on her side.|$|E
5|$|By July 1929 {{the last}} of the {{superstructure}} had been cleared, and Bremse was turned upside down using techniques developed on salvaging some of the destroyers. Compressors were then used to pump air into the hull and bring her to the surface, while she was supported by 9-inch wires attached to two floating docks anchored on her port shoreward side. The salvage teams had almost raised her when she suddenly toppled onto her side and then <b>heeled</b> over gradually during the night, settling onto the rocks inshore.|$|E
40|$|The {{cause of}} <b>heel</b> pain or pain at Antromedial part of <b>heel</b> is unknown, so precise method of {{treatment}} is also unknown. <b>Heel</b> spur is one of important factor that may affect response to treatment in <b>heel</b> pain and {{in the present study}} its effect on the treatment of <b>heel</b> pain is evaluated. In this clinical trial 126 patients suffering from <b>heel</b> pain were treated medically (Oral NSAID, <b>heel</b> pad and local steroid injection). According to imaging study patients were divided in two groups (group one with <b>heel</b> spur, and group two without <b>heel</b> spur). After 4 weeks follow up improvement of <b>heel</b> pain occurred in 62 cases of group two and 34 cases of group one. Thus <b>heel</b> spur causes resistance to medical therapy...|$|R
50|$|<b>Heel</b> pad syndrome, {{also known}} as <b>heel</b> fat pad syndrome, <b>heel</b> pad atrophy and <b>heel</b> fat pad atrophy, is a pain that occurs {{in the center of}} the <b>heel.</b> It is {{typically}} due to atrophy of the fat pad which makes up the <b>heel.</b> Risk factors include obesity. Other conditions with similar symptoms include plantar fasciitis. Treatment includes rest, pain medication, and <b>heel</b> cups. It becomes more common with age.|$|R
2500|$|High-heeled {{footwear}} is footwear {{that raises}} the <b>heels,</b> typically 2inches (5cm) or more above the toes, commonly worn by women for formal occasions or social outings.

5|$|The Kriegsmarine {{considered}} the ships {{to be good}} sea boats, with a slight roll. As built, they were wet in a head sea, though this was significantly improved by the installation of a clipper bow in 1940–1941. The ships were highly maneuverable, particularly when the maneuvering setting for the diesel engines was used, in which half of the engines for each shaft were run in reverse. The ships <b>heeled</b> over up to 13degrees with the rudder hard over. The low stern was wet in a stern sea, and equipment stored there was frequently lost overboard.|$|E
5|$|Around noon, as {{a result}} of poor {{coordination}} and signaling, the Swedish line unexpectedly turned toward the allied fleet. When the flagship Kronan came about in the maneuver it suddenly <b>heeled</b> over and began to take in water. According to master gunner Anders Gyllenspak, the sails were not reefed and the ship leaned over so hard that water flooded in through the lower gunports. As the ship was leaning over, a gust of wind pushed the ship on her side, bringing her masts and sails down in line with the surface of the sea. Shortly afterwards, the gunpowder store exploded and ripped the forward section of the starboard side apart. Kronan quickly lost buoyancy and sank, taking most of her 850-man crew with her.|$|E
5|$|Commercial artist Russell H. Tandy was {{the first}} artist to {{illustrate}} Nancy Drew. Tandy was a fashion artist and infused Nancy with a contemporary fashion sensibility: her early style {{is that of a}} flatfoot flapper: <b>heeled</b> Mary Janes accompany her blue flapper skirt suit and cloche hat on three of the first four volume dust jackets. As styles changed over the next few years, Nancy began to appear in glamorous frocks, with immaculately set hair, pearls, matching hats, gloves, and handbags. By the 1940s, Nancy wore simpler, tailored suits and outfits; her hair was often arranged in a pompadour. In the post-war era, Tandy's Nancy is shown hatless, wearing casual skirt and blouse ensembles, and carrying a purse, like most teens of the late 1940s.|$|E
50|$|<b>Heel</b> styles now {{vary from}} the {{original}} French (pyramidal) or point <b>heel</b> which was made most famous by the Aristoc Point <b>Heel</b> design to the Cuban and Havana heels—darkened reinforced <b>heel</b> design finishing in a square top rather than pointed top—the Cuban <b>heel</b> being defined by being much thinner and finishing higher up the calf than the Havana <b>heel.</b>|$|R

5|$|Early in {{the battle}} {{something}} went wrong. While engaging the French galleys the Mary Rose suddenly <b>heeled</b> (leaned) heavily over to her starboard (right) side and water rushed in through the open gunports. The crew was powerless to correct the sudden imbalance, and could only scramble {{for the safety of}} the upper deck as the ship began to sink rapidly. As she leaned over, equipment, ammunition, supplies and storage containers shifted and came loose, adding to the general chaos. The massive port side brick oven in the galley collapsed completely and the huge 360-litre (90 gallon) copper cauldron was thrown onto the orlop deck above. Heavy guns came free and slammed into the opposite side, impeding escape or crushing men beneath them.|$|E
5|$|On October 16, {{with the}} ship's coal stores running low, Captain Budington {{decided to run}} the Polaris aground near Etah. Having lost much of their bedding, clothing, and food when it was haphazardly jettisoned from the ship on October 12, the {{remaining}} 14 men were in poor condition to face another winter. They built a hut from lumber salvaged from the ship, and on October 24, extinguished the ship's boilers to conserve coal. The bilge pumps stopped for good, and the ship <b>heeled</b> over on her side, half out of water. Fortunately, the Etah Inuit helped the men survive the winter. After wintering ashore, the crew built two boats from salvaged wood from the ship, and on June 3 the crew sailed south. They were spotted and rescued in July by the whaler Ravenscraig, and returned home via Scotland.|$|E
5|$|The Königsberg-class cruisers had a {{standard}} crew of 21officers and 493enlisted men. This later increased to 23officers and 588591enlisted men, and during World War II, the crew size rose to between 820 and 850 officers and men. The ships carried {{a number of}} smaller vessels, including two picket boats, two barges, two launches, one cutter, and one dinghy. The ships were moderately good sea boats, but {{had the potential to}} capsize if internal stores were improperly loaded, and suffered from a slight lee helm. They <b>heeled</b> up to twenty degrees with the rudder hard over. They were nevertheless very maneuverable and lost little speed in a head sea. In a hard turn, they lost up to 20percent speed.|$|E

25|$|With {{the long}} toe, low <b>heel</b> {{conformation}} can come contracted <b>heels</b> (narrowing of the <b>heel)</b> which further compresses the navicular bone along with sheared <b>heels</b> adding more stress to the tendons and navicular bones.|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of <b>heel</b> ulcers across settings {{is high and}} is increasing. Prevention of ulcers requires knowledge of their etiology and the scientific basis for preventive care.

This article focuses on the prevention of <b>heel</b> pressure ulcers. The physiology of <b>heel</b> tissue perfusion, the effect of external pressure on <b>heel</b> perfusion, as well as what is known about strategies to reduce external pressure and approaches to improve <b>heel</b> skin blood flow will be discussed. It is only through understanding of the physiology of <b>heel</b> tissue perfusion and its relation to external pressure that effective preventive measures to reduce <b>heel</b> skin breakdown can be adapted in clinical practice...|$|R
5|$|The {{ships were}} {{regarded}} in the German Navy as excellent sea boats {{with an easy}} roll; the ships rolled up to 30° with a period of 10seconds. They maneuvered easily; at hard rudder the ships lost up to 60percent speed and <b>heeled</b> over 9°. However, they suffered from severe vibration, particularly at the stern, at high speeds. They also had very wet bows, even in moderate seas. The ships had a crew of 33 officers and 650 enlisted men. However, when serving as a squadron flagship, the crew was augmented by an additional 13 officers and 66 enlisted men. While acting as a second command ship, 9 officers and 44 enlisted men {{were added to the}} standard crew. Wittelsbach and her sisters carried a number of smaller vessels, including two picket boats, two launches, one pinnace, two cutters, two yawls, and two dinghies.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} very stable, {{primarily}} because of their wide beam. The ships suffered from only slight pitching and rolling, even in the heavy seas of the North Atlantic. Bismarck and Tirpitz were responsive to commands from the helm; they were capable of manoeuvring with rudder deflections as small as 5°. With the rudder completely over, the ships <b>heeled</b> only 3°, but lost up to 65% of their speed. The ships handled poorly at low speeds or when travelling astern. As a result, tugs were necessary in confined areas to avoid collisions or grounding. The ships had a standard crew of 103 officers and 1,962 enlisted sailors. The ships carried smaller boats, including three picket boats, four barges, one launch, two pinnaces, two cutters, two yawls, and two dinghies.|$|E
5|$|The ships' hulls were {{constructed}} from longitudinal steel frames. The hulls {{were divided into}} fourteen watertight compartments and a double bottom that extended for 72percent {{of the length of}} the keel. The Kriegsmarine regarded the ships as good sea boats, with gentle motion. At low speed, however, they were affected unpredictably by wind and currents. The ships <b>heeled</b> up to fourteen degrees and lost up to 50% speed with the rudder hard over at high speed. The ships had a standard complement of 42officers and 1,340enlisted men. Wartime modifications increased the crew to 51officers and 1,548sailors. The ships carried several smaller vessels, including two picket boats, two barges, one launch, one pinnace, and two dinghies.|$|E
5000|$|Pain in the <b>heel,</b> {{usually on}} {{the middle of the}} <b>heel.</b> This is in direct {{contrast}} to plantar fascia pain or <b>heel</b> spur pain which is present {{at the front of the}} <b>heel,</b> not the middle.|$|R

50|$|The main {{differential}} diagnosis of <b>heel</b> pad syndrome is plantar fasciitis. In <b>heel</b> pad syndrome {{all parts of}} the <b>heel</b> are tender while in plantar fasciitis typically only the part of the <b>heel</b> closer to the toes is sore.|$|R
5|$|The {{battle was}} at a {{stalemate}} {{for the next five}} or six hours, with all the participants immobilized. Bonnet's men had the advantage that their deck was <b>heeled</b> away from their opponents, giving them cover, while the Henrys deck was tilted toward the pirates, thus exposing Rhett's men to punishing musket volleys. Bonnet's force suffered twelve casualties while killing ten and wounding fourteen of Rhett's 70-man crew. Most of Bonnet's men fought enthusiastically, challenging their enemies to board and fight hand to hand, and tying a knot in their flag as a mock signal to come aboard and render aid. Bonnet himself patrolled the deck with a pistol drawn, threatening to kill any pirate who faltered in the fight. Nevertheless, some of the prisoners who had been forced to join the pirate crew refused to fire on Rhett's men, and one narrowly escaped death at Bonnet's hands in the confusion of the engagement.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the first}} leg of the semi-final against Birmingham City, QPR had not won an away match during their League Cup campaign. They were one goal down at half time, and again were forced to recover the deficit during the second half. In the 55th minute, Marsh scored his 34th goal of the season, he headed the ball into the goal after a corner kick from Allen. Marsh was {{involved}} again in QPR's second and third goal as he set up Roger Morgan for the second, and then back <b>heeled</b> the ball through to Lazarus for the third. QPR's fourth and final goal saw Marsh hit a header direct from a free kick to Allen who scored. The second leg secured QPR's first trip to Wembley, and marked {{the first time that a}} team from the Third Division had reached any Wembley final. They won the game 3–1, but they did not score until the last twelve minutes of the match.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool had {{the first}} attack of the half when they were awarded a free-kick for foul on José Enrique. The {{subsequent}} free-kick was cleared by Whittingham {{only as far as}} Henderson whose shot was wide of the Cardiff goal. Two minutes later Cardiff had a chance to extend their lead; Whittingham went past Agger and passed to Don Cowie, who back <b>heeled</b> the ball to Miller, his subsequent shot went wide of the Liverpool goal. Henderson received the first yellow card of the match after his tackle on Mason was deemed to be too high. Cardiff had another chance in the 56th minute; a Gunnarsson long throw was punched away by Reina, but the clearance fell to Hudson, who headed the ball into the Liverpool penalty area to Gestede, his subsequent header was blocked by the Liverpool goalkeeper. Liverpool made the first substitution of the match a minute later when Henderson was replaced by Craig Bellamy. Two minutes after the substitution, Liverpool equalised. Downing took a corner kick, which was headed on by Carroll to Suárez, whose header hit the post, it rebounded to Škrtel; his shot went into the Cardiff goal to level the match at 1–1. Cardiff {{had the first}} chance after Liverpool's goal, but Mason's shot was saved by Reina.|$|E
40|$|The goal on this {{investigation}} {{was to develop a}} detachable high <b>heel</b> shoe construction that could enter the current high <b>heel</b> market. The impact of high <b>heel</b> shoes on women's fashion is enormous but there are associated issues of comfort and health with these shoes. This work aims to maintain the appealing aspects of a high <b>heel</b> shoe while adding a concealed mechanism to enable the <b>heel</b> to be easily removed to convert the shoe into a flat at the discretion of the user. The current solutions and products in the nearly 7 billion dollar a year women's shoe market are minimal. The prior arts of detachable <b>heels</b> fail to develop a simple comprehensive detachable high <b>heel</b> that can enter the market. A feasible and complete design that takes into account arch stiffness, <b>heel</b> removal, styling, and manufacturability is the goal of this work. This investigation deconstructed high <b>heel</b> shoes to learn and leverage the current high <b>heel</b> shoe infrastructure as a basis for adapting the shoe into a detachable high <b>heel</b> shoe construction. Three prototypes of the detachable high <b>heel</b> shoe were developed with a shoe assembly that consisted of a modified insole and a detachable <b>heel</b> that consisted of a dovetailed aluminum shank fastened to a high <b>heel.</b> (cont.) The prototypes were able to display the ability for the detachable high <b>heel</b> to maintain high <b>heel</b> stability, styling that is consistent with the industry, ease of use, a flat shoe and other critical functional requirements identified in the work. The construction was consistent with the current industry high <b>heel</b> infrastructure. The development of the detachable high <b>heel</b> construction displays the feasibility of such a product in a market where none exist. The detachable high <b>heel</b> construction needs further refinement and optimization to complete a design that is ready to enter this exciting market. by Alfredo Louis Morales. Thesis (S. B.)
