50|$|In the US, ether {{was used}} as a {{recreational}} drug during the 1930s Prohibition era, when alcohol was made illegal. Ether was either sniffed or drunk and, in some towns, replaced alcohol entirely. However, the risk of death from excessive sedation or overdose is greater than that with alcohol, and ether drinking is associated with damage to the stomach and gastrointestinal tract. Use of <b>glue,</b> <b>paint</b> and gasoline became more common after the 1950s. Abuse of aerosol sprays became more common in the 1980s, as older propellants such as CFCs were phased out and replaced by more environmentally friendly compounds such as propane and butane. Most inhalant solvents and gases are not regulated under drug laws such as the United States' Controlled Substances Act. However, many US states and Canadian cities have placed restrictions on the sale of some solvent-containing products to minors, particularly for products widely associated with sniffing, such as model cement. The practice of inhaling such substances is sometimes colloquially referred to as huffing, sniffing (or glue sniffing), dusting, or chroming.|$|E

The parameters analyzed in the effluents before and after treatment were selected according {{to the type of}} wastewater and included pH, conductivity, apparent colour, turbidity, total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and some metals. The coagulant proved to be efficient for almost all effluents tested. The best results were obtained for the paper industry wastewater, with 91 % removal of chemical oxygen demand and 95 % of total suspended solids removal. The estimated cost of this treatment would be only 0. 24 Euro per cubic meter of treated effluent, only regarding the price of the coagulant and the required dosage. The use of this coagulant is also adequate for the valorisation of the sludge obtained, which in this case could be recycled for paper production...|$|E
40|$|What are inhalants? Inhalants are {{breathable}} chemical vapors or gases {{that produce}} psychoactive (mind-altering) effects when abused or misused. These include volatile organic solvents, fuel gases, nitrites, and anesthetic gases. They {{do not include}} inhaled medicinal drugs that are taken as prescribed. Once {{commonly referred to as}} “glue sniffing, ” inhalant abuse now includes a broad range of volatile solvents and gas products (e. g., model airplane <b>glue,</b> <b>paint</b> thinner, gasoline, and nail polish remover), aerosols (e. g., nonstick cooking spray and hair spray), anesthetics (e. g., nitrous oxide or “laughing gas ” and ether), and nitrites (e. g., amyl, butyl, and isobutyl nitrites, often marketed as “poppers ” or room odorizers). (Other powdered drugs, such as heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine, can be inhaled but are not considered inhalants.) Although the chemicals involved and their effects vary, the route of administration is the common factor. What are the most common modes of administration? Inhalants are abused either by “sniffing ” through the nose or inhaling fumes through the open mouth (“huffing”) much like a smoker inhales cigarette smoke. Usually the open tube of glue, nail polish, or marker is placed close to the nose and the fumes are inhaled. People who abuse inhalants may also spray the substance into a plastic or paper bag and huff that way (“bagging”) or even place the bag over the entire head. Often a product will be poured or sprayed on a piece of cloth, a rag, a towel, or a shirt sleeve or into a soda can and inhaled in that manner. Another method is to paint the fingernails with a product such as correction fluid and inhale the substance from the nails. Sometimes an aerosol substance is sprayed directly into the mouth. Substances also can be placed into alternative containers (e. g., balloon filled with nitrous oxide) or heated and then inhaled (Synergies 2002). Who is likely to abuse inhalants? Contrary to popular perception, people who abuse inhalants are found throughout the population and no one group can be categorized as “inhalant abusers. ” In 2001, more than 18. 2 million Americans reported ever having used an inhalant, and 141, 000 were estimated to need treatment because they were dependent on or abused inhalants.

40|$|Children are {{constantly}} exposed to many chemicals via the products {{they come in}} contactwith in their everyday life. One chemical group is phthalates, the most commonly usedplasticisers in the world. Phthalates are used mainly in PVC plastic products like floors, toys,food containers and wallpaper {{but they are also}} used in rubber, <b>glue,</b> <b>paint,</b> cables etc. Sincethese chemicals are weakly chemically bound to the PVC they can leak and migrate to the air,food, water and skin. Children are exposed to phthalates mainly through food, but because ofthe hand to mouth behaviour they are also exposed via dust inhalation and dust ingestion. About ten years ago regulations of the most toxic phthalates in toys and child care productswere implemented in the EU and from February 2015 it is a general prohibition for the use ofDEHP (diethylhexyl phthalate), DnBP (di-n-butyl phthalate), DiBP (diisobutyl phthalate) andBBzP (butyl benzyl phthalate). DiNP (diisononyl phthalate) is a relatively new phthalate andit has replaced DEHP to some extent in floors and toys. In phthalate free products DINCH(1, 2 -cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid diisononyl ester) is one of the plasticizer replacingphthalates. The banned phthalates have been shown to cause adverse effects on reproductionand recent research also investigates links between phthalate exposure and asthma and allergysymptoms in children. More experimental animal studies are needed to further investigate theasthma and allergy correlation. In the present project dust samples were collected from 30 preschool indoor environments inthe Stockholm city area to evaluate the levels of the six substances mentioned and thephthalate DEP (diethyl phthalate). The main aim of this thesis project was to search forrelations and links between the phthalate concentrations in dust and parameters from theindoor environment in preschools. Studied parameters are e. g. construction year, floor type,cleaning routines and quantity of toys and furniture made of plastic or foam. The project wascommissioned by the Swedish EPA and performed at the Institute of Environmental Medicine(IMM) at Karolinska Institutet. A negative relation was found between dust phthalate (DEHP and DnBP) concentrationand construction year. Also rooms with old PVC floors had higher concentrations of DEHPand DnBP in dust than rooms with new PVC floors. There was also a trend that dust frompreschools with PVC floors had higher DiNP concentration than dust from preschools withother floor types. The preschools that used foam mattresses for resting had higher DiNPconcentrations than those with no foam mattresses. Most preschools had new foammattresses, which could indicate a more common use of DiNP in new mattresses or mattress 2 covers compared to old mattresses that contains more DEHP. The four Waldorf preschoolsthat participated had lower DiNP dust concentrations than the other preschools, which wasexpected since Waldorf orientation includes using as little plastic material as possible. Norelation was found between the phthalate dust concentrations and the quantity of toys made ofsoft plastic in the sampled area. Many preschools had made a plastic inventory where they removed old and soft plastic toysand material. Also many preschools recently replaced old foam mattresses used for resting. This could be due to the big chemical focus in the media and authorities and the brochuresthat have been sent out {{the last couple of years}} about what preschool can do to decrease thechemical exposure of children. This interest and awareness seen in the preschools waspositive and hopefully the trend spreads to more preschools. Since children spend a big part oftheir time at preschools it is an important mission for society and the government to decreasethe exposure to hazardous chemicals there. Hopefully what has been done so far is just thebeginning...|$|E

5000|$|Quality of {{adhesive}} bonding such as <b>gluing,</b> <b>painting,</b> varnishing and coating depends strongly {{on the ability}} of the adhesive to efficiency cover (wet) the substrate area. This happens when the surface energy of the substrate is greater than the surface energy of the adhesive. However, high strength adhesives have high surface energy. Thus, their application is problematic for low surface energy materials such as [...] polymers. To solve this problem, surface treatment is used as a preparation step before {{adhesive bonding}}. It cleans the surface from the organic contaminants, removes a weak boundary layer, chemically bonds to the substrate a strong layer with high surface energy and chemical affinity to the adhesive, and modifies the surface topography enabling capillary action by the adhesive. Importantly, surface preparation provides a reproducible surface allowing consistent bonding results.|$|R
