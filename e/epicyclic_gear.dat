25|$|The {{superior}} planet systems—Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn—all {{follow the}} same general principle of the lunar anomaly mechanism. Similar to the inferior systems, each has a gear whose centre pivot is on an extension of b1, and which meshes with a grounded gear. It presents a pin and a centre pivot for the <b>epicyclic</b> <b>gear</b> which has a slot for the pin, and which meshes with a gear fixed to a coaxial tube and thence to the pointer. Each of the three mechanisms can fit within a quadrant of the b1 extension, and they are thus all on a single plane parallel with the front dial plate. Each one uses a ground gear, a driving gear, a driven gear, and a gear/coaxial tube/pointer, thus, twelve gears additional in all.|$|E
25|$|The {{inferior}} planet mechanism {{includes the}} sun (treated as a planet in this context), Mercury, and Venus. For {{each of the}} three systems there is an <b>epicyclic</b> <b>gear</b> whose axis is mounted on b1, thus the basic frequency is the Earth year (as it is, in truth, for epicyclic motion in the sun and all the planets—excepting only the moon). Each meshes with a gear grounded to the mechanism frame. Each has a pin mounted, potentially on an extension of one side of the gear that enlarges the gear, but doesn't interfere with the teeth; in some cases the needed distance between the gear's centre and the pin is farther than the radius of the gear itself. A bar with a slot along its length extends from the pin toward the appropriate coaxial tube, at whose other end is the object pointer, {{out in front of the}} front dials. The bars could have been full gears, although there is no need for the waste of metal, since the only working part is the slot. Also, using the bars avoids interference between the three mechanisms, each of which are set on one of the four spokes of b1. Thus there is one new grounded gear (one was identified in the wreckage, and the second is shared by two of the planets), one gear used to reverse the direction of the sun anomaly, three epicyclic gears and three bars/coaxial tubes/pointers, which would qualify as another gear each. Five gears and three slotted bars in all.|$|E

2500|$|In {{discussing}} the spur gear differential, {{the use of}} the term annular gear is a convenient way to distinguish the sun gears of the two <b>epicyclic</b> <b>gear</b> trains. [...] The second sun gear serves the same purpose as the annular gear of a simple planetary gear train, but clearly does not have the internal gear mate that is typical of an annular gear.|$|E
2500|$|The Moon train {{starts with}} gear b1 and {{proceeds}} through c1, c2, d1, d2, e2, e5, k1, k2, e6, e1, and b3 {{to the moon}} pointer on the front face. The gears k1 and k2 form an <b>epicyclic</b> <b>gear</b> system; they are an identical pair of gears that don't mesh, but rather, they operate face-to-face, with a short pin on k1 inserted into a slot in k2. The two gears have different centres of rotation, so the pin must {{move back and forth}} in the slot. That increases and decreases the radius at which k2 is driven, also necessarily varying its angular velocity (presuming the velocity of k1 is even) faster in some parts of the rotation than others. [...] Over an entire revolution the average velocities are the same, but the fast-slow variation models the effects of the elliptical orbit of the moon, in consequence of Kepler's second and third laws. The modelled rotational period of the moon pointer (averaged over a year) is 27.321 days, compared to the modern length of a lunar sidereal month of 27.321661 days. As mentioned, the pin/slot driving of the k1/k2 gears varies the displacement over a year's time, and the mounting of those two gears on the e3 gear supplies a precessional advancement to the ellipticity modelling with a period of 8.8826 years, compared with the current value of precession period of the moon of 8.85 years.|$|E

50|$|Most (if not all) IVTs {{result from}} the {{combination}} of a CVT with an <b>epicyclic</b> <b>gear</b> system with a fixed ratio. The combination of the fixed ratio of the <b>epicyclic</b> <b>gear</b> with a specific matching ratio in the CVT side results in zero output. For instance, consider a transmission with an <b>epicyclic</b> <b>gear</b> set to 1:−1 gear ratio; a 1:1 reverse gear. When the CVT side is set to 1:1 the two ratios add up to zero output. The IVT is always engaged, even during its zero output. When the CVT is set to higher values it operates conventionally, with increasing forward ratios.|$|E
