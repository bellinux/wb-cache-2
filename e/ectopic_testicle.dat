40|$|The term splenosis {{applies to}} the autotransplanted splenic tissue {{resulting}} from seeding {{in the context of}} past splenic trauma or surgery. We report a 42 -year-old man with a history of splenectomy observed for an incidentally found retrovesical mass thought to be an <b>ectopic</b> <b>testicle.</b> The abdominal laparotomy revealed multiple focuses of pelvic splenosis. As splenosis can be diagnosed through specific imaging studies one should always consider it in differential diagnosis of a mass discovered years after splenic surgery or trauma.

40|$|A 13 -year-old male was {{admitted}} because of abnormality of the scrotal contents on the left. He {{had received a}} radical operation of the left external inguinal hernia {{at the age of}} 1 year. Two testicular tumors and the spermatic cords were palpated in the left half of the scrotum, but no scrotal contents were palpated in the right half. At operation, it was obvious that the left scrotal contents consisted of the uterus with tubae and two testicles with spermatic cords. Hysterogram during the operation showed the uterus opened into the prostatic urethra. The uterus and tubae were extirpated. After the biopsy of the testicles, ectopic right testicle was brought to the right and fixed in the right half of the scrotum. Histologically the <b>ectopic</b> <b>testicle</b> showed almost normal spermatogenesis. We discussed our own case in reference to other literatures...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{reports a}} case of {{unilateral}} extracorporeal ectopic testes in a captive coati (Nasua nasua) in the State Park of Dois Irm√£os Zoo, Recife/PE, Brazil. The testicle was located in the subcutaneous tissue of the inguinal region not adhered to the surrounding tissues. After bilateral orchiectomy, both testes were measured, fixed with 10 % formalin buffered and embedded in paraffin for histopathological evaluation. The left testis measured 1. 2 cm width by 1. 7 cm length, and the right one measured 1. 5 cm width by 2. 0 cm length. The ectopic testes had seminiferous epithelium without post-meiotic germ cell lines. The non-ectopic testis had several changes in the seminiferous epithelium that indicated degeneration. In both epididymis, the lumen did not contain sperm and the major epithelial structural alterations were more distinct in the epididymis associated to the <b>ectopic</b> <b>testicle.</b> In conclusion, the ectopic testis and epididymis had lesions compatible with testicular exposition to body temperature. Non-ectopic epididymis and testis had minor lesions but {{could be related to}} the infertility of the coati...|$|E
40|$|I {{evaluated}} the medical reports and scrotal mri-examinations of 128 patients. The intrascrotal findings {{of these patients}} were classified as seminomas (18), non-seminomas (14), hematomas (29), inflammatory changes (22), <b>ectopic</b> <b>testicles</b> (5) and normal findings in MRI (8). Scrotal findings that not be classified into these groups were summarized {{in the group of}} mixed results (32). Seminomas were found more frequent in significantly higher rates in-histologically atrophic testicles, in the group of non-seminomas was a significantly accumulation the histologically intratumoral bleeding. There was seldom a correlation from intratumoral bleeding and necroses with the signal intensity of the seminomas and nonseminomas. The native sequences are not suitable to differentiate between seminomas and nonseminomas because of a similar mr-signal-pattern. A distinction between seminomas and nonseminomas is possible by the consideration of morphology and for contrast medium behaviors. It is a seminoma with a great probability if the tumor is not round, limited blurredly, does not show any hypointense pseudocapsule in the T 2 -sequence and enriches after the contrast medium centrally homogeneously, in addition septa- and ringlikely and in the first contrast study more strongly than in a second. It is a nonseminoma with a great probability if the tumor is round, surrounded by a hypointense pseudocapsule in the T 2 -sequence, the contrast medium is without septa- and ringlikely structures and the contrast enhancement is not stronger in the first one of two studies. In addition to tumoral changes I examined typical MR-appearances of 44 hematomas were looked at by 29 patients. The signal intensity and the contrastenhancement from the periphery and center of the hematomas were looked separatly and also its dependence from the age. There was found no dependence of the central and peripheral signal intensity in the T 1 -sequence, of the central signal intensity in the T 2 -sequence and of the contrast medium behavior of the hemtoma age. Hematoma with strong hypointense periphery in the T 2 -sequence and similarly relatively homogeous signal behavior in both sequences were older than these without these features. Rare cases like an intrascrotal acute myeloic leukemia, a granulosa cell tumor (child 1 d old), a presumably testicular melanoic metastasis and unclear bilateral scrotal lipomatous changes was discribed casuistically. No significant connections between benign or malign scrotal entities and hydroceles were found. Non-seminoma was more offen seen in connection with varicoceles. Benign results offen showed an ipsilateral edema of scrotal wall and/or spermatic cord connected with a corresponding contrast medium enrichment in with particularly inflammable changes in the foreground stood here...|$|R
