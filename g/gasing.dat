40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of monolayer GaS and <b>GaSe</b> crystals are investigated {{in terms of}} their elastic constants: in-plane stiffness (C), Poisson ratio (ν), and ultimate strength (σU) by means of first-principles calculations. The calculated elastic constants are compared with those of graphene and monolayer MoS 2. Our results indicate that monolayer GaS is a stiffer material than monolayer <b>GaSe</b> crystals due to the more ionic character of the Ga-S bonds than the Ga-Se bonds. Although their Poisson ratio values are very close to each other, 0. 26 and 0. 25 for GaS and <b>GaSe,</b> respectively, monolayer GaS is a stronger material than monolayer <b>GaSe</b> due to its slightly higher σU value. However, GaS and <b>GaSe</b> crystals are found to be more ductile and flexible materials than graphene and MoS 2. We have also analyzed the band-gap response of GaS and <b>GaSe</b> monolayers to biaxial tensile strain and predicted a semiconductor-metal crossover after 17 % and 14 % applied strain, respectively, for monolayer GaS and <b>GaSe.</b> In addition, we investigated how the {{mechanical properties}} are affected by charging. We found that the flexibility of single layer GaS and <b>GaSe</b> displays a sharp increase under 0. 1 e/cell charging due to the repulsive interactions between extra charges located on chalcogen atoms.

Graphene, as a layered material with large charge carrier mobility, has been studied for years.

In this study, <b>GaSe</b> single atomically layered crystal was grown by vapor phase transport method, InSe atomically layered flakes were prepared by mechanical exfoliation method. TEM and SEM were applied to characterize the quality of the crystals. Raman studies revealed the changes of vibration modes as the number of layers varied.
