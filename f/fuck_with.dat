500|$|... "Don't <b>fuck</b> <b>with</b> the formula" [...] is a quote {{and subject}} of {{controversy}} {{attributed to the}} Beach Boys' lyricist and co-lead vocalist Mike Love circa 1967. Love called it the [...] "most famous thing I've ever said, even though I never said it." [...] It originates from a 1971 Rolling Stone magazine article written by freelancer Tom Nolan, in which business associate David Anderle reported disagreements from within the Beach Boys' circle. According to Anderle, Love wanted the band to remain profitable for himself—"and don't <b>fuck</b> <b>with</b> the formula." [...] In the ensuing decades, the line has been repeated in myriad books, articles, websites, and blogs.|$|E

500|$|At {{the age of}} 25, Bakshi was {{promoted}} to director. His first assignment was the series Sad Cat. Bakshi {{and his wife had}} separated by then, giving him the time to animate each short alone. Bakshi was dissatisfied with the traditional role of a Terrytoons director: [...] "We didn't really 'direct' like you'd think. We were 'animation directors,' because the story department controlled the storyboards. We couldn't affect anything, but I still tried. I'd re-time, mix up soundtracks—I'd <b>fuck</b> <b>with</b> it so I could make it my own." ...|$|E

Wendy speaks with the Iraqi men in fluent Arabic and pays them with a wad of American money. Later, Wendy watches joyfully as the rocket blows up in the sun, and Kyle realizes Wendy hired the Iraqis to kill Ms. Ellen.

500|$|The {{statement}} [...] "don't <b>fuck</b> <b>with</b> the formula" [...] originates from a 1971 Rolling Stone {{magazine article}} written by freelancer Tom Nolan titled [...] "The Beach Boys: A California Saga". Nolan's article devoted minimal {{attention to the}} group's music, and instead focused on the band's internal dynamics and history. In the field of music writing, its style was unprecedented, as journalist David Hepworth writes, the [...] "story within was destined to become a classic piece from that brief interlude when pop writing collided with New Journalism ... It combined admiration for the group's achievements with distaste for their strange, inner world {{in a way that}} hadn't been done before". [...] The relevant text pertaining to the [...] "formula" [...] quote is as follows: ...|$|E

[...] In the line [...] "I don't <b>fuck</b> <b>with</b> you niggas/I own the Clippers/I own some homes/I own my own liquor" [...] Minaj references ex-Clippers owner Donald Sterling, who was banned from the NBA after leaked recordings of him making racist comments were made public. She also mentions Will and Jada Smith in the lyrics: [...] "Bitches can't beat me they ain't got the skill/Eye of the tiger they ain't got the kill/Look up to Jada/I love her and Will." ...|$|E
500|$|Matthew Gilbert of the Boston Globe {{compiled}} {{his list}} of most annoying TV characters. Jenny came second on the list and he stated: [...] "Wow. The gods of narcissism blessed Jenny bigtime. She was just too, too self-centered. She sucked {{the life out of}} everyone who crossed her path." [...] He also opined that Kirshner's portrayal of Jenny's [...] "vanity and chameleon-like qualities" [...] was perhaps too convincing. He perceived scriptwriters as eventually understanding the [...] "profundity of Jenny's annoying effect", and decided to escalate it. Gilbert concluded that in early seasons, when writers wanted the audience's sympathy with Jenny's journey of self-realization, he [...] "wanted her to leave The Planet for good." [...] Regarding Jenny's mental state, Lydia Martin from The Miami Herald quipped [...] "(Marina) sauntered into The Planet just to <b>fuck</b> <b>with</b> Jenny's head. As if Jenny's head needed the encouragement".|$|E
50|$|The {{difference}} between Dishonored {{and how it}} works in Half-Life 2 is that it's a lot more personal.

500|$|In {{the ensuing}} decades, [...] "don't <b>fuck</b> <b>with</b> the formula" [...] has been {{repeated}} in myriad books, articles, websites, and blogs. The remark is usually invoked {{to signal the}} conflicts that arose between Wilson and Love when the former began subverting the [...] "formula" [...] that brought the Beach Boys their initial success: songs with lyrics that embraced girls, cars, and surfing. Following the collapse of Smile, Wilson gradually ceded production and songwriting duties {{to the rest of}} the band. [...] "Brian Wilson" [...] and [...] "The Beach Boys" [...] were still viewed as synonymous entities, and he was expected to fulfill the band's commercial interests. Nolan's article inspired a 1978 biography by David Leaf, titled The Beach Boys and the California Myth, which concluded that [...] "If Brian sought refuge within drugs, in reaction to all the pressure, then everybody must share the blame—the record company, the family, the Beach Boys, and Brian's entourage." ...|$|E
500|$|I think that's bullshit. The word {{police can}} fuck off. I don't {{want to be}} policed! I'm not {{interested}} in political correctness. The word [...] "bitch" [...] means {{a lot of different}} things. Everything is about context. When I first moved to England and heard the word [...] "cunt", I was horrified. People were calling each other cunts! And then I realized that, in that culture, it was different—they slapped each other on the back and said, [...] "Who's the cunt, right, you're my best mate!" [...] The word [...] "fuck" [...] doesn't just mean sexual intercourse. I mean, [...] "You're a stupid fuck," [...] "Are you going to <b>fuck</b> <b>with</b> me?" [...] "Fuck off!"... Sex {{has nothing to do with}} any of those expressions, and the same goes for [...] "bitch". If I say to you, [...] "I'm a badass bitch," [...] I'm owning myself, I'm saying, [...] "I'm strong, I'm tough, and don't mess with me." [...] If I say, [...] "Why are you being such a bitch to me?," [...] well, that means something else.|$|E
500|$|Berkowitz (real name Scott Putesky) later {{claimed to}} have been [...] "shut out" [...] of {{recording}} sessions, and alleged that other band members destroyed much of his equipment—the four-track recorder, which had been used to produce many of the band's early demos, had been microwaved, and his drum machine had been discarded. The latter was subsequently revealed to have been thrown from a second-story window. He was also highly critical of Reznor, whom he alleged destroyed a Fender Jaguar which had been given to him by his father as a child, saying: [...] "I was in the studio, and they were all in the control room, and I'm playing guitar. At the end, Trent says, 'Do it again, but do it more like this.' We went through this three times, and he says, 'Hold on. I'll come in there. Let me show you what I'm talking about.' So I take my guitar off, hand it to him—and he smashes it, just to <b>fuck</b> <b>with</b> me. Then he laughed and left the room." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{recording}} of Stankonia began in spring of 1999 and lasted {{for about a}} year. Owning a studio helped the band expand creatively, as the duo {{did not need to}} worry about time constraints that would occur with a rented studio. André 3000 observed, [...] "You can sit there and <b>fuck</b> <b>with</b> just a kick and a snare all day long if you want to... You're not working on the clock. [...] Really, you're just working on your mind." [...] Big Boi spent the majority of the recording time in the studio, while André 3000 worked at home, creating beats and experimenting with an acoustic guitar. [...] One song that came from a jam session on the guitar was [...] "Ms. Jackson", the album's second single. [...] André 3000 also created song lyrics by writing words on the walls of his home: [...] "I had planned to paint my house anyway; writing on the walls was just something I would do." [...] One stray lyric on his wall eventually developed into [...] "Gasoline Dreams".|$|E
500|$|On January 27, 1991, at a music {{industry}} {{party at the}} Po Na Na Souk club in Hollywood, Dr. Dre assaulted television host Dee Barnes of the Fox television program Pump it Up, because he felt dissatisfied with her news report about the feud between the remaining N.W.A members and Ice Cube. Barnes filed a $22.7 million lawsuit {{in response to the}} incident. Subsequently, Dr. Dre was fined $2,500, given two years' probation, ordered to undergo 240 hours of community service, and given a spot on an anti-violence public service announcement on television. The civil suit was settled out of court. Barnes stated that Young [...] "began slamming her face and the right side of her body repeatedly against a wall near the stairway." [...] Dr. Dre later commented [...] "People talk all this shit, but you know, somebody fucks with me, I'm gonna <b>fuck</b> <b>with</b> them. I just did it, you know. Ain't nothing you can do now by talking about it. Besides, it ain't no big thing – I just threw her through a door." ...|$|E

[...] The tongue-in-cheek word [...] "Yeah!" [...] is repeated after each verse. Another lyric, [...] "It's a new art form showing people how little we care" [...] is described as [...] "perfectly damning the wave of banal hedonism most recently celebrated by the MTV Video Music Awards", according to Kevin Liedel from Slant Magazine. At the bridge, Lorde sings [...] "I fall apart, with all my heart/ And you can watch from your window", which was described as a [...] "perfect" [...] commentary on the breakdowns of teenage celebrities in an article published by The Huffington Post.|$|E

500|$|Love denied ever telling Wilson [...] "don't <b>fuck</b> <b>with</b> the formula", {{adding that}} the Beach Boys [...] "have no formula. In 1967 alone, the year I {{supposedly}} made that comment, we recorded Wild Honey, an R album that was entirely different from anything we'd ever done, and I cowrote ten songs and sang three leads." [...] In 1975, he voiced appreciation of the musical form and content of [...] "Surf's Up" [...] from Smile, which he believed went beyond what is normally expected of commercial pop music, {{and in the same}} 1992 article where he refers to some of the Pet Sounds lyrics as [...] "nauseating", he calls Parks a [...] "very gifted musician", saying: [...] "He's great. He's one of the nicest persons in the world. And I tell him, 'Hey, I thought your lyrics, Van Dyke, were brilliant, except who the fuck knows what you're talking about!' That's exactly how I talk to him (laughs). And he and I joke about it." [...] He considers that [...] "a lot of people don't understand I {{have a sense of humor}} that's kind of wack, or different, or sometimes bratty, so I get labeled with that and there goes my image, right down the toilet." ...|$|E
500|$|Love {{has had a}} {{significant}} impact on female-fronted alternative acts and performers. She has been cited as a particular influence on young female instrumentalists, once infamously proclaiming: [...] "I want every girl in the world to pick up a guitar and start screaming." [...] "I strap on that motherfucking guitar and you cannot <b>fuck</b> <b>with</b> me. That's my feeling," [...] she said. In The Electric Guitar: A History of an American Icon, it is noted: [...] Having sold over 3 million records in the United States alone, Hole became one of the most successful rock bands of all time fronted by a woman. VH1 ranked Love [...] 69 in their list of The 100 Greatest Women in Music History in 2012. In 2015, the Phoenix New Times declared Love the number one greatest female rock star of all time, writing: [...] "To build a perfect rock star, there are several crucial ingredients: musical talent, physical attractiveness, tumultuous relationships, substance abuse, and public meltdowns, just to name a few. These days, Love seems to have rebounded from her epic tailspin and has leveled out in a slightly more normal manner, but there's no doubt that her life to date is the type of story people wouldn't believe in a novel or a movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "You'll See" [...] is an {{acoustic}} pop ballad. It {{is set in}} the time signature of common time, having a tempo of 120 beats per minute. The song is played in the key of G Major, with a basic sequence of Em–D–Em as its chord progression during the first verse, while piano and guitar are used to play the background music. The sequence shifts to Em–C–D–G–C–F during the chorus. Madonna's voice spans from G3 to C5. Throughout the chord changes progression to give Madonna's vocals dominance in the song, and after a minute the percussion starts with a tremolo guitar added later. String synths and drums build the track further with the second verse seeing the singer harmonizing with herself. During the recording of the track, the singer used her vocal lessons for Evita; she said [...] "If you listen to those songs, you can hear how I was trying to absorb and utilize what I was learning for the recording [...]" [...] Lyrically the song talks of independence after the end of a love affair stating that Madonna will go onto greater things. When asked if the track was about revenge, the singer replied: [...] "No, it's about empowering yourself", but also adding that [...] "there's another side too which is—'Don't <b>fuck</b> <b>with</b> me, I don't need anybody. I can do what I want'".|$|E
