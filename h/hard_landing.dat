5|$|On 23 February 1987, a Douglas DC-9 from Scandinavian Airlines {{landing at}} Værnes {{en route from}} Bodø Airport was written off after a <b>hard</b> <b>landing</b> on the runway. This {{was caused by a}} high sink rate caused by the pilot {{interrupting}} the landing checklist and forgetting to arm the spoilers. No-one was killed in the accident.|$|E

5|$|In 1971 a Boeing 747, {{operating}} as Pan Am 845 struck approach light structures for the reciprocal runway as it lifted off the runway at San Francisco Airport. Major {{damage to the}} belly and landing gear resulted, which caused the loss of hydraulic fluid from three of its four flight control systems. The fluid which remained in the fourth system gave the captain very limited control {{of some of the}} spoilers, ailerons, and one inboard elevator. That was sufficient to circle the plane while fuel was dumped and then to make a <b>hard</b> <b>landing.</b> There were no fatalities, but there were some injuries.|$|E
5|$|It took {{thirty minutes}} {{to clear the}} runway and rig an arresting cable and Armstrong telephoned Edwards and asked for someone to collect him. Milt Thompson was sent in an F-104B, the only {{two-seater}} available, but a plane Thompson had never flown. With great difficulty, Thompson made it to Nellis, but a strong crosswind caused a <b>hard</b> <b>landing</b> and the left main tire suffered a blowout. The runway was again closed to clear it, and Bill Dana was sent to Nellis in a T-33 Shooting Star, but he almost landed long—and the Nellis base operations office decided that to avoid any further problems, {{it would be best}} to find the three NASA pilots ground transport back to Edwards.|$|E
5|$|Hammerfest {{was served}} from 1935 by {{scheduled}} seaplanes at a water aerodrome at Rypefjord. Services were interrupted by World War II, but resumed in 1945, lasting until the 1963 opening of Alta Airport. Hammerfest Airport opened on 1 August 1974, along {{with four other}} regional airport in Finnmark and Troms, and was originally served with de Havilland Canada Twin Otters. The de Havilland Canada Dash 7 was introduced in 1983 and a helicopter base was established in 1989. The Dash 8 was introduced in 1995 and the airport was nationalized two years later. A Dash 8 was damaged beyond repair after a <b>hard</b> <b>landing</b> in 2005. Because of the limited space for expansion and unfavorable wind conditions, there is a proposal {{to build a new}} airport at Grøtnes.|$|E

5|$|Two Australian CH-47Ds were {{destroyed}} in Afghanistan. On 30 May 2011, A15-102 crashed in Zabul Province, {{resulting in the}} death of an Army unmanned aerial vehicle pilot who was travelling on board as a passenger. As it was impractical to recover the helicopter, it was destroyed by Coalition forces. The official inquiry into the crash found that it was caused by a known issue in which Chinooks suffered uncommanded pitch oscillations while flying through dense altitudes, and that the aircrew had not been adequately trained to prevent such incidents. A15-103 was written off following a <b>hard</b> <b>landing</b> in Kandahar Province on 22 June 2012, resulting in minor injuries to one of its aircrew. Both of the Chinooks at Kandahar International Airport in April 2013 also suffered significant damage when the airport was struck by a severe hail storm. Two ex-US Army CH-47Ds were purchased in December 2011 to replace A15-102, and arrived in Australia in January 2012.|$|E

50|$|Failures {{included}} three U.S. attempts in 1962 to <b>hard</b> <b>land</b> small seismometer packages {{released by the}} main Ranger spacecraft. These surface packages were to use retrorockets to survive landing, unlike the parent vehicle, {{which was designed to}} deliberately crash onto the surface. The final three Ranger probes performed successful high altitude lunar reconnaissance photography missions during intentional crash impacts between 2.62 and 2.68 km/s km/h.|$|R

40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} two decades, control over the US {{bankruptcy}} reorganization process has shifted from a debtor's pre-bankruptcy managers to holders of secured claims. The result has been increased adherence to absolute priority and a <b>harder</b> <b>landing</b> for the debtor's managers and shareholders. Because managers still make or can influence the decision whether or when to file a bankruptcy petition, we hypothesize that anticipation of bankruptcy under these new conditions {{will result in a}} delay in filing, increased leverage, increased secured debt, and a reduction of asset value for firms at the time they file. We present empirical evidence consistent with our hypotheses...|$|R

5000|$|During the Norman era in {{the late}} 11th and 12th centuries, a {{nucleated}} village began to appear, prompted {{by the development of}} a north-south [...] "High Street" [...] forming part of a longer route from the capital city, London, to the port of Shoreham on the English Channel coast. [...] This replaced an earlier northeast-southwest route linking local farms to the older settlement of West Green, about 0.5 mi west of Crawley, because a north-south route could take advantage of an area of drier, <b>harder</b> <b>land</b> formed by an outcrop of sandstone from the Hastings Beds that jutted into the sticky, waterlogged Weald Clay, which predominated around West Green and Crawley.|$|R
