What hasn't been tried is medication and intensive psychotherapy." [...] In the same article, Dr. Manijeh Nikakhtar, a Los Angeles psychiatrist and co-author of Addiction or Self-Medication: The Truth (...) , says she received a letter from Downey in 1999, during his time at Corcoran II, asking for advice on his condition. She discovered that [...] "no one had done a complete [...] evaluation ...I asked him flat out if he thought he was bipolar, and he said, 'Oh yeah. There are times <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of money and I'm hyperactive, and there are other times I'm down.'" [...] In an article for the March 2007 issue of Esquire, Downey told author Scott Raab that he wanted to address [...] "this whole thing about the bipolar" [...] after receiving a phone call from [...] "the Bipolar Association" [...] asking him about being bipolar. When Downey denied he had ever said he was bipolar, the caller quoted the People article, to which Downey replied, [...] "'No! Dr. Malibusian said ...', and they go, 'Well, it's been written, so we're going to quote it.'" [...] Downey flatly denied being [...] "depressed or manic" [...] and that previous attempts to diagnose him with any kind of psychiatric or mood disorder have always been skewed because [...] "the guy I was seeing didn't know I was smokin' crack in his bathroom. You can't make a diagnosis until somebody's sober." ...|$|E

50|$|Well, {{geography}} {{is about the}} world around you so <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time staring out of my window! In between staring, I get information from books, TV programmes, magazines and the internet. I am {{also a member of}} the Royal Geographical Society (with Institute of British Geographers) in London. It's where all the great geographical expeditions of the past set out from. They have a fantastic library and lots of things belonging to explorers like Captain Scott (included stuffed penguins) and David Livingstone (including his diary, boots etc). The trouble is, finding out about deserts or poles etc is so fascinating, I tend to get carried away and do far more research than I can cram into the book.|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} was serialised in the Mail on Sunday: Since I was 13 or 14, I knew I {{was a bit}} different. I hate labels though. That's the way I am.

I've had to say this to people I'm close to again and again. This is who I am. This is what I do. <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time trying {{to work things out}} but once I know something about myself, I know it. I don't agonise. It's logical to me.

50|$|Recently I've {{been using}} Epson inkjet {{printers}} and flatbed scanners as tools to make works that act like drawings, paintings, even sculptures. <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{of time with}} books and so logically I've ended up using pages from books as material- pages torn from books and fed through an inkjet printer. I've been using a very pared down vocabulary of simple shapes and letters drawn or typed in Microsoft Word, then printed on top of these pages from catalogues, magazines, posters- and even blank canvas. The resulting images aren't exactly what the machines are designed for - slick digital photographs. There is often a struggle between the printer and my material - and the traces of this are left on the surface: snags, drips, streaks, mis-registrations, blurs.|$|E

5000|$|The album {{gets off}} to a faster start with [...] "Irrational Anthem," [...] a sort of {{thematic}} overture for the record. [...] "Lyrically," [...] says Higgenson, [...] "I think it says exactly what I want the album to say. I think the line that sums up the whole album is Let your mind go anywhere it wants to. Don't lose your imagination. Don't get {{so wrapped up in}} your day-to-day life that you forget to dream or be creative, or forget to recapture those things or at least remember them. That's the beauty of life.

50|$|In 2001, Ryan {{said the}} {{following}} about her writing:I don’t adhere {{to any particular}} school of thought, except {{in the broadest sense}} that my writing is inextricably bound up with my feminism. This would be the only real connector between my books. I am interested in trying to find ways in which language may be interrupted, disrupted and rejigged for feminist purposes (among others). Usually this attempt would arise from something in either my personal life or the world around me. My home state is currently enacting a legal clamp-down on women, with regard to street prostitution—passing laws that restrict women’s movements and rights to occupy space. Though such factors are often what ‘provokes’ me into a poem, the poem equally draws life off other books (like most poets, <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time reading). I work by a kind of principle of immersion in particular poets at particular times.|$|E
5000|$|The script of [...] "The Hunters" [...] {{describes}} Horton as [...] "an imposing man, muscular {{and intelligent}} in appearance". Horton was initially {{supposed to be}} the villain in only [...] "The Hunters" [...] and [...] "The Watchers". Hudson believed that because those episodes went well, [...] "they wrote me back in a couple more episodes" [...] and that [...] "when they got short of ideas they thought of me again, over the years." [...] Hudson believed that [...] "partly, it was geography because <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time in France, anyway," [...] so he was available for filming when production moved to Paris. Paul thought that Hudson [...] "has an amazing stillness about him which has an evil quality to it." [...] Kirsch thought Hudson [...] "was so simple, (...) he would listen to everything and react to everything around him. He never had a preconception of how a scene should be (...) I think that he never liked to play Horton because Hudson didn't get over it, of being the bad guy, he was just very available." [...] Paonessa thought Hudson [...] "makes it look effortless." ...|$|E

In the 2009 book Jerry Lee Lewis: Lost and Found, Kennedy insists that [...] "Jerry {{was one of the}} easiest people I ever worked with. I've heard <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of stories of how he butted head with other people, but we always got along great. <b>I</b> didn't <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time socializing with him.

50|$|The sisters {{have made}} {{themselves}} endearingly vulnerable in this album by showing {{us not only}} the fantastical, exclusive universe they have created, but also the deep-seated insecurities that helped to build it. In the song “Animals”, Sierra reveals the pain that accompanies her love of nature, singing, “I always knew <b>I</b> would <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time alone/ No one would understand me/ Maybe I should go and live amongst the animals”. CocoRosie bring us music like we’ve never heard. It’s abrasive, unsettling, mysterious, and innocent {{all at the same}} time. It is as imperfect as it is honest. The Casady sister’s ask only one thing: that you “Promise me that you’ll cherish/ This tarnished/ Oh this tarnished offering”.|$|R
5000|$|Besides Desiree, Ruby {{also as a}} son, Buddy. Ruby {{gave birth}} to her {{children}} six months apart, [...] "That way <b>I</b> could <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time with them and make sure that they were growing up right." [...] Desiree steals from the morgue where she works. [...] Buddy was the product of incest. Ruby had an affair with her uncle, Shep. She was able to conceal her pregnancy by telling her mother that she was [...] "nursing kids for the county." [...] Buddy didn't meet his [...] "Uncle Daddy" [...] until he was an adult competing in a car show contest. Shep took the car Buddy won and disappeared from his life yet again.|$|R
5000|$|Merullo’s {{early works}} have been termed {{thoughtful}} and reflective. [...] "I think I am {{a person who}} cares about the emotional life of people...and so <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time on the emotional experiences of my characters—rather than, say, their intellectual experiences," [...] he once said. [...] But, Golfing with God, Breakfast with Buddha and American Savior exhibited a more overtly spiritual theme - albeit humorous in tone. The seeds of this thematic shift can perhaps be traced to A Little Love Story. However, in the fall of 2008, Merullo surprised many with the release of Fidel’s Last Days, his first thriller. Merullo has addressed these changes saying, [...] "...I've had editors counsel me to write the same book over and over, and some readers who complained that I haven’t kept writing books set in greater Boston. But it would be like trying to keep a migratory bird in your backyard. I just want to go places, to see things, to observe the human predicament in different forms... Like most novelists, I have a peculiar fascination with the way people behave and the psychological roots of, or reasons for, their behavior..." ...|$|E
5000|$|Regarding the {{decision}} to write and record an EP not long after Nocturnes release, Tatum noted: [...] "You {{can do whatever you}} want with EP, like it’s a free pass. People don’t really expect as much from an EP, so you’re free to do what you want to do. And that is what was so empowering about this particular experience for me. I never needed to take a step back and obsess over what kind of music I was making. I didn’t think that some people might think it’s weird that I’m making this electronic pop song or I’m making this really ambient, droney song. I just did what I wanted to do and it felt good not to think about the outside perspective. I do that so much. <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time worrying about what other people think. But this EP was the most fun I’ve had writing and recording in a long time. ... A lot of times bands put out EPs with the leftover tracks that didn’t make it onto the album for some reason. But this was not like that for me." ...|$|E

Her work demonstrates her respect for and engagement with craftsmanship and the stories of everyday peoples' lives. She was especially interested in [...] "the evidence of the maker's hand." [...] As she explained:I like things that are handmade and I like to see people's hand in the world, anywhere in the world; it doesn't matter to me where it is. And in my own work, I do everything by hand and feet. I don't project or use anything mechanical most of the time, because even though I do {{spend a lot of}} time trying to perfect my line work and my hand, my hand will always be imperfect because I'm human. And I think it's the part that's off that's interesting, that even if I'm doing really big letters and <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time going over the line and over the line and trying to make it straight, I'll never be able to make it straight. From a distance it might look straight, but when you get close up, you can always see the line waver. And I think that's where the beauty is.|$|E

He reached impasse {{while serving as}} a Visiting Research Associate studying {{the environmental impact of}} ethical theories at the University of California, Berkeley and Stanford University in the 1975-1976 academic year.

My eyes went over two interstates, each of which had 12 lanes and all these people.

5000|$|Elena {{suffered}} a serious injury when a bone detached itself from her knee. A medical specialist {{told her that}} her injury could be repaired through surgery. Her chances of ever again competing at the highest level would be negligible. In fact it could mean she would never be a gymnast again. Elena took plenty of rest and homeopathic treatments. Her resilience and spirit won through. [...] "When I was injured my coach believed in me and didn't give up on me. In my mind I knew I could still be on the team. I kept going."She did well at school, was an avid reader, particularly world classics, and enjoyed history and science fiction and going to the cinema and theatre. Korshunov remembered [...] "She never misses a chance of buying new books when competing in other places. Elena swallows one book after another.

5000|$|Wide Eyeds {{first two}} tracks, [...] "To Know You" [...] and [...] "Who You Are", {{were written by}} Nordeman {{while working as a}} {{waitress}} in Los Angeles before being signed to a record label. She described the former as a song that [...] "was really born out of that freedom I felt to really come to God and say, 'I need some help with these issues in my life.'" [...] A Psychology graduate, Nordeman tended to write the album's songs with a theological or philosophical context, saying that [...] "I think I've always been a pretty analytical person. I think <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time pouring over who I am, and who I'd like to be, and who I wish I wasn't so much of." [...] She continued, [...] "I don't know if that's been affected by studying psychology, or if that is just kind of my make up as a person." [...] Nordeman also revealed that her approach in writing lyrics comes in different ways, saying [...] "Sometimes, there's something I've been thinking about - an issue or a question or just something that I've been wrestling with for weeks or months - and finally it just comes spilling out because it has no other choice. Other times, something will just grab me - a headline, or a conversation I've had with someone, or maybe just a goofy observation that I've made - and that in itself will inspire an entire song. Really for me it's just about observing life, my own life, too, and trying to be introspective and thoughtful about my own growth. I guess it's a type of journaling experience." ...|$|E

And from Carroll O'Connor I learned <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> about how you perform and how important the script and story are for the actors. So the actor doesn't have to push things. You can let the story and the dialogue support you if it's good. I had great people around me and I took from all the people who were around." [...] He also stated, when he compared Carroll O'Connor's character to his acting mentor's real-life persona: [...] "Carroll O'Connor brought his humanity to the character even though he had these abhorrent views. He's still a feeling, human being. He loved his wife even though he acted the way he did, and he loved his daughter. Those things come out. I don't think anybody's all good or all bad." ...|$|R
