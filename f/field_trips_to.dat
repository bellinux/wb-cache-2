5|$|As {{the highway}} would {{pass through the}} Hamersley National Park, the Environmental Protection Authority decided in 1983 that an Environment Review and Management Program report was {{required}} for the Newman to White Springs section. Consultants prepared the report for Main Roads, which found that the key risks were erosion, visual impact, and possible damage to flora. A detailed survey was carried out, which included the use of laser and infra-red measuring devices from within a helicopter, and numerous <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> <b>to</b> determine the final alignment and bridge sites. A comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement was then produced, and the project was approved in mid-1984.|$|E
5|$|The head {{today is}} used {{for a variety of}} reasons. Firstly it is a tourist spot where country walks can be taken all over the head due to the well defined gravel paths, some of which form part of the Bournemouth Coast Path. In 2008, many paths were resurfaced, making more (though not all) parts of the head {{wheelchair}} accessible. For example, it is now possible to gain wheelchair access to Quarry Pool. Regular <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> <b>to</b> the site are made by students of all ages and there are occasional guided tours or meetings around the head covering a wide variety of subjects.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} the school's plan {{to set up a}} Global Academy, HCI {{established}} its Beijing Satellite Campus in 2007, {{the first of its kind}} for a Singapore school. An agreement was inked with a top school in China, Beijing's The Second High School Attached to Beijing Normal University, in which classrooms will be leased. A total of four batches of students make their way to the campus every year, staying for up to two months. Priority is given to scholars of HCI's Bicultural Studies Programme and Humanities Programme. Students in the campus take lessons together with students from China in partner schools, carry out community involvement activities, and take <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> <b>to</b> cities such as Xi'an, Tianjin and Shanghai.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Marquis was {{spending}} {{a great deal}} of time on his research into the Custer battle. He now had a dozen Cheyenne informants, including Wooden Leg. With them, from June 1928, communicating mainly with sign language or through interpreters, he consulted maps and went on <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> <b>to</b> the battle site. He also corresponded with George Bird Grinnell, Generals Hugh L. Scott and Edward S. Godfrey, and with Custer's widow Elizabeth Custer. He also started loaning out some of his Custer memorabilia for exhibitions. Personal contacts during this period included Laton Alton Huffman, a well-known Montana frontier photographer, W.H. Banfill of the Billings Gazette, who wrote Western history articles, artist and author Will James, and James Willard Schultz, author and explorer.|$|E
5|$|When {{designing}} the game's fictional locations, the team tried to represent iconic {{features of the}} American frontier; New Austin features small towns and outposts, Nuevo Paraíso includes rebel outposts and Mexican army forts, and West Elizabeth represents the civilized areas of the world. These three locations represent a developing nation, a province {{on the brink of}} war, and an advanced nation, respectively. The American frontier was extensively researched for the game. The team organized <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> <b>to</b> Washington, visited the Library of Congress, captured a multitude of photographs, and analyzed various classic Western films. A challenge that the team faced {{as a direct result of}} the world's size was to include enough content to interest players. Using this challenge as a strength and a major part of the design process, the team tried to make the countryside wild, with a variety of potential events to occur. They initially believed that it was possible to use the formula of Grand Theft Auto IV (2008)—a large variety of mission styles with different activities and objectives—in Red Dead Redemption; as development continued, they realized that the emptiness of the world resulted in the inability to use this formula.|$|E

25|$|While a {{graduate}} student at Berkeley, Johnston met Mildred (Millie) Hillis, a girl who shared his strong Christian faith. When Alvarez discovered how much Johnston missed Hillis, he arranged for Johnston to be flown back to Berkeley. Johnston and Hillis married, and returned to Boston together. She sometimes accompanied them on <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> <b>to</b> test the ground-controlled approach radar system. They had five children: Mary Virginia (Ginger), Margy, Dan, Lois, and Karen.|$|E

25|$|OU {{owns the}} wooded area {{just south of}} Highway 9 between Chautauqua and Jenkins. This area is called Oliver's Woods. Ecology classes take <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> <b>to</b> Oliver's Woods frequently. They can use the area to study Ecological {{patterns}} including tree growth and pH in the ground. Visible patterns of plant dispersion can be studied in Oliver's Woods as well, including uniform, random, and clumped patterns. The area has a trail for people to follow and a creek running through the lower elevated area.|$|E
25|$|Some tree farms {{offer more}} than just a chance to cut down a live Christmas tree. Outdoor and holiday themed {{activities}} are not uncommon and include wagon rides, offering hot cocoa or cider, Santa Claus visits and holiday crafts. Many tree farms actively encourage schools to sponsor <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> <b>to</b> the farms. One grower in Kansas contended that usual worries for businesses, such as a tight economy, do not affect Christmas tree farms. The grower thought that obtaining a tree from a Christmas tree farm was something that almost nothing could stop; an activity that transcended the economy and the weather.|$|E

25|$|His Two on the Aisle (1927) {{sold for}} a {{personal}} record $1,500, enabling Hopper to purchase an automobile, which he used to make <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> <b>to</b> remote areas of New England. In 1929, he produced Chop Suey and Railroad Sunset. The following year, art patron Stephen Clark donated House by the Railroad (1925) to the Museum of Modern Art, the first oil painting that it acquired for its collection. Hopper painted his last self-portrait in oil around 1930. Although Josephine posed for many of his paintings, she sat for only one formal oil portrait by her husband, Jo Painting (1936).|$|E
25|$|In 1998 the Blaffer Gallery {{founded the}} Young Artists Apprenticeship Program (YAAP), which {{provides}} a free after-school arts program to at-risk and special needs high school students. It is a six-week, after-school workshop and provides an in-depth exploration of an artistic medium, such as printmaking or videography. Students work with Blaffer staff and University of Houston students to create art, study current exhibitions and take <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> <b>to</b> local museums and galleries. The program finishes with a final project which is displayed in a museum exhibition and the top two students in the program win college scholarships.|$|E

Pearse's restless idealism led him {{in search of an}} even more idyllic home for his school. He found it in the Hermitage, Rathfarnham, to which he moved St Enda's in 1910. Pearse was also involved in the foundation of St Ita's school for girls, a school with aims similar to those of St Enda's.|$|E

A dance/exercise studio {{is on the ground}} floor of the building. In 1987 the Jerusalem Foundation incorporated the Gerard Behar theatre complex, the Beit Ha'Am educational and library facilities, and the dance studio into a larger public complex known as the Jacob & Hilda Blaustein Civic Center.|$|E
25|$|Motivated by {{a desire}} to halt looting, curb pseudoarchaeology, and to help {{preserve}} archaeological sites through education and fostering public appreciation for the importance of archaeological heritage, archaeologists are mounting public-outreach campaigns. They seek to stop looting by combatting people who illegally take artifacts from protected sites, and by alerting people who live near archaeological sites of the threat of looting. Common methods of public outreach include press releases, and the encouragement of school <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> <b>to</b> sites under excavation by professional archaeologists. Public appreciation of the significance of archaeology and archaeological sites often leads to improved protection from encroaching development or other threats.|$|E
25|$|With {{funding from}} Edward Butler, Addams opened an art {{exhibition}} and studio space {{as one of}} the first additions to Hull House. On the first floor of the new addition there was a branch of the Chicago Public Library, and the second was the Butler Art Gallery, which featured recreations of famous artwork as well as the work of local artists. Studio space within the art gallery provided both Hull House residents and the entire community with the opportunity to take art classes or to come in and hone their craft whenever they liked. As Hull House grew, and the relationship with the neighborhood deepened, that opportunity became less of a comfort to the poor and more of an outlet of expression and exchange of different cultures and diverse communities. Art and culture was becoming a bigger and more important part of the lives of immigrants within the 19th ward, and soon children caught on to the trend. These working-class children were offered instruction in all forms and levels of art. Places such as the Butler Art Gallery or the Bowen Country Club often hosted these classes, but more informal lessons would often be taught outdoors. Addams, with the help of Ellen Gates Starr, founded the Chicago Public School Art Society (CPSAS) in response to the positive reaction the art classes for children caused. The CPSAS provided public schools with reproductions of world-renowned pieces of art, hired artists to teach children how to create art, and also took the students on <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> <b>to</b> Chicago's many art museums.|$|E
