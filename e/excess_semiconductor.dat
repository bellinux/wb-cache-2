5000|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, M.P. Lepselter {{developed}} the techniques for fabricating a structure consisting of electroforming {{an array of}} thick, self-supporting gold patterns on a thin film Ti-Pt Au base, hence the name [...] "beams", deposited {{on the surface of}} a silicon wafer. The <b>excess</b> <b>semiconductor</b> from under the beams was removed, thereby separating the individual devices and leaving them with self-supporting beam leads or internal chiplets cantilevered beyond the semiconductor. The contacts served as electrical leads in addition to also serving the purpose of structural support for the devices.|$|E
40|$|Single {{crystals}} of Mg 2 Si and Mg 2 Ge, of high purity, on {{the order}} of 1 mm x 1 mm x 1 em in size were obtained, and measurements were made of their electrical resistivities and Hall coefficients in the temperature range 60 °K- 1000 °K. Both compounds behaved typically as <b>excess</b> impurity <b>semiconductors</b> and exhibited apparent intrinsic conduction above 450 °K...|$|R
5000|$|Acceptor {{impurity}} atoms {{have fewer}} valence electrons than the atoms they replace in the intrinsic semiconductor lattice. They [...] "accept" [...] electrons from the semiconductor's valence band. This provides excess holes to the intrinsic <b>semiconductor.</b> <b>Excess</b> holes increase the hole carrier concentration (p0) of the semiconductor, creating a p-type semiconductor.|$|R
5000|$|Donor {{impurity}} atoms {{have more}} valence electrons than the atoms they replace in the intrinsic semiconductor lattice. Donor impurities [...] "donate" [...] their extra valence electrons to a semiconductor's conduction band, providing excess electrons to the intrinsic <b>semiconductor.</b> <b>Excess</b> electrons increase the electron carrier concentration (n0) of the semiconductor, making it n-type.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a Dye sensitized solar cell (DYSSC), {{which is called}} as future generation solar cell. It is {{a new class of}} green photovoltaic cell based on photosynthesis principle in nature. DYSSCs are fabricated using two different natural dyes as sensitizers, which extracted from the materials existing in nature and our life, such as flowers, leaves, fruits, traditional Chinese medicines, and beverages. The use of sensitizers having a broad absorption band in conjunction with oxide films of nanocrystalline morphology permits to harvest a large fraction of sunlight. There are good prospects to produce these cells at lower cost and much better efficiency than conventional semiconductor devices by introducing various chemical and natural dyes. DYSSC are implemented with simple and new technique to overcome the energy crisis and <b>excess</b> cost of <b>semiconductor</b> solar cells...|$|R
40|$|Charge {{carriers}} {{in organic}} crystals are often trapped in point defects. The persistence {{time of the}} charge in these defect states is evaluated by computing the escape rate from this state using non-adiabatic rate theory. Two cases are considered (i) the hopping between separate identical defect states and (ii) the hopping between a defect state and the bulk (delocalized) states. We show that only the second process {{is likely to happen}} with realistic defect concentrations and highlight that the inclusion of an effective quantum mode of vibration is essential for accurate computation of the rate. The computed persistence time {{as a function of the}} trap energy indicates that trap states shallower than 0. 3 eV cannot be effectively investigated with some slow spectroscopic techniques such as THz spectroscopy or EPR commonly used to study the nature of <b>excess</b> charge in <b>semiconductors...</b>|$|R
