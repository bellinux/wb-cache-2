5000|$|I {{was always}} {{interested}} in what motivates human behavior... When I completed my PhD, I realized I {{had an opportunity to}} apply what I knew to the emerging world of personal technology, when companies like Apple and Microsoft were just getting started. I started IntelliQuest Information, Inc., which I later took public, to analyze how people were using personal technology and incorporating it into their lives. What was so interesting about the technology world in the 1980s was that companies were very good at product development but were not so good at tuning in to marketplace needs. I was able to inform business efforts by providing consumer information that I gathered through some of the first electronic surveys. ‚ÄîPeter Zandan, 2013.
