5|$|A few ASD {{cases have}} been linked to {{exposure}} to teratogens (agents that cause birth defects) during the first eight weeks from conception. Although this does not <b>exclude</b> <b>the</b> possibility that ASD can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that it arises very early in development. Many environmental factors have been hypothesized to act after birth, but none has been confirmed by scientific investigation.|$|E

5000|$|The {{main purpose}} of the {{procedures}} in the minimal group paradigm is to exclude [...] "objective" [...] influences from the situation. In the context of in-group favoritism, the anonymity of participants' personal identities <b>excludes</b> <b>the</b> influence of interpersonal favoritism. The omission of the self as a recipient in the resource distribution task <b>excludes</b> <b>the</b> influence of direct personal self-interest. The absence of any link between total in-group gain and individual gain <b>excludes</b> <b>the</b> influence of realistic competition. Finally, the absence of intergroup status hierarchies, together with the triviality and minimal social content of <b>the</b> groups, <b>excludes</b> <b>the</b> influence of normative or consensual discrimination.|$|R
5|$|After {{the rise}} of philosophy, history, prose and rationalism in the late 5th century BC, the fate of myth became uncertain, and mythological genealogies gave place to a {{conception}} of history which tried to <b>exclude</b> <b>the</b> supernatural (such as the Thucydidean history). While poets and dramatists were reworking the myths, Greek historians and philosophers were beginning to criticize them.|$|E
5|$|An MR venogram is also {{performed}} {{in most cases}} to <b>exclude</b> <b>the</b> possibility of venous sinus stenosis/obstruction or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. A contrast-enhanced MRV (ATECO) scan has a high detection rate for abnormal transverse sinus stenoses. These stenoses can be more adequately identified and assessed with catheter cerebral venography and manometry. Buckling of the bilateral optic nerves with increased perineural fluid is also often noted on MRI imaging.|$|E
5|$|D-dimers are a fibrin {{degradation}} product, and {{an elevated}} level {{can result from}} plasmin dissolving a clot—or other conditions. Hospitalized patients often have elevated levels for multiple reasons. When individuals are at a high-probability of having DVT, diagnostic imaging is preferred to a D-dimer test. For those with a low or moderate probability of DVT, a D-dimer level might be obtained, which excludes a diagnosis if results are normal. An elevated level requires further investigation with diagnostic imaging to confirm or <b>exclude</b> <b>the</b> diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|Observations of 55 Cancri A in the {{submillimeter}} {{region of}} the spectrum have thus far failed to detect any associated dust. The upper limit on emissions within 100AU of this star is about 850mJy, at a wavelength of 850μm. This limits the total mass of fine dust around the star to less than 0.01% of the Earth's mass. However, this does not <b>exclude</b> <b>the</b> presence of an asteroid belt or a Kuiper belt equivalent.|$|E
5|$|Plants grown under UVB light {{are more}} {{resistant}} to insect herbivory compared with plants grown under filters that <b>exclude</b> <b>the</b> radiation. When tomato plants are exposed to a pulse of UVB radiation and then weakly wounded, PIs accumulate throughout the plant. By themselves, neither the radiation nor weak wounding is sufficient to induce systemic PI accumulation. Tomato cell cultures respond similarly, with systemin and UVB acting together to activate MAPKs. Short pulses of UVB also cause alkalisation of the culturing medium.|$|E
5|$|Ultrasound is {{commonly}} used {{in the evaluation of}} people who have sustained physical trauma, for example with the FAST protocol. Ultrasound may be more sensitive than chest X-rays in the identification of pneumothorax after blunt trauma to the chest. Ultrasound may also provide a rapid diagnosis in other emergency situations, and allow the quantification {{of the size of the}} pneumothorax. Several particular features on ultrasonography of the chest can be used to confirm or <b>exclude</b> <b>the</b> diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{importance}} of The Slave Community was recognized by scholars of American slavery, Blassingame's conclusions, methodology, and sources were heavily criticized. Historians criticized the use of slave narratives that were seen as unreliable and biased. They questioned Blassingame's decision to <b>exclude</b> <b>the</b> more than 2,000 interviews with former slaves conducted by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in the 1930s. Historians argued that Blassingame's use of psychological theory proved unhelpful in his interpretation. Blassingame defended his conclusions at a 1976 meeting of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History and in 1979 published a revised and enlarged edition of The Slave Community. Despite criticisms, The Slave Community is a foundational text {{in the study of}} the life and culture of slaves in the antebellum South.|$|E
5|$|By December 1942 {{there were}} {{concerns}} that even Oak Ridge {{was too close}} to a major population center (Knoxville) in the unlikely event of a major nuclear accident. Groves recruited DuPont in November 1942 to be the prime contractor for the construction of the plutonium production complex. DuPont was offered a standard cost plus fixed-fee contract, but the President of the company, Walter S. Carpenter, Jr., wanted no profit of any kind, and asked for the proposed contract to be amended to explicitly <b>exclude</b> <b>the</b> company from acquiring any patent rights. This was accepted, but for legal reasons a nominal fee of one dollar was agreed upon. After the war, DuPont asked to be released from the contract early, and had to return 33 cents.|$|E
5|$|During jury {{selection}} in the United States, attorneys have two options for excluding potential jurors. The first option {{is a challenge}} for cause, in which attorneys must state the reason for a challenge (such as clear bias or a conflict of interest), the opposing party is allowed to respond, and the judge decides whether to <b>exclude</b> <b>the</b> juror. The second option is a peremptory challenge, where an attorney can exclude a juror without stating any reason. While challenges for cause are unlimited, attorneys have {{a limited number of}} peremptory challenges, sometimes as few as four, although 10 is more common in non-capital felony cases.|$|E

5|$|Finnish–Estonian {{relations}} were closest diplomatically after the Estonian Freedom War in the 1920s, but cooled afterwards. Military relations however remained close. From the Finnish point of view, the close relations with Estonia did not <b>exclude</b> <b>the</b> Scandinavian neutrality policy. Nevertheless, the military {{relations were}} top secret, and the countries held joint military exercises. The central {{aim was to}} prevent the Soviet Baltic Fleet from freely using its strength in the Gulf of Finland against either country. Estonia also sought public security guarantees and signed the Baltic Entente in 1934 with Latvia and Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|From the outset, Chamarro {{performed}} a delicate balancing act. Her choice {{to lead the}} Assembly, , {{was rejected by the}} UNO vote, which chose Myriam Arguello and Chamorro kept her word not to go against the vote. Her Vice President-elect Virgilio Godoy was in favor of hard-line policies to <b>exclude</b> <b>the</b> Sandinistas, but Chamorro retained Daniel Ortega's brother, Humberto Ortega, as a military leader, granting herself the position of Defense Minister and naming Humberto to second-in-command as the Chief of Staff. For this, Chamorro's critics accused her of supporting the Sandinistas, but it proved to be a valuable political move, as it demonstrated that, {{for the good of the}} nation, she was willing to compromise in ways that fostered reconciliation. She also appointed three FSLN cabinet members, including one for agrarian reform.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, protest against South Africa's {{apartheid}} regime reached {{the stage of}} seeking to <b>exclude</b> <b>the</b> nation from international sport. In 1956, government rules requiring separate events for whites and non-whites in South Africa were issued; non-whites received poorer facilities. Brundage initially opposed taking any action. The run-up to the 1960 Rome Olympics had seen tumult in South Africa, including the Sharpeville massacre and a crackdown on the African National Congress. Activists attempted to persuade Brundage that South Africa should be excluded from the Games. Brundage initially took the word of South African sport leaders that all citizens were able to compete for {{a place on the}} Olympic team, and that non-white South Africans simply were not good enough.|$|E

5|$|In {{the sixth}} stage, Aucouturier, Garin and Dortignac escaped {{in the last}} kilometres. Aucouturier signed first at the control post in Ville-d'Avray. From that point, the race was neutralised until the velodrome Parc-des-Princes, where the riders would ride the final kilometre. At the moment that the riders arrived in Paris, it started to rain. The organisers decided {{together}} with the cyclists to <b>exclude</b> <b>the</b> final kilometre from the race, and make the control post in Ville-d'Avray {{the end of the}} race. This made Aucouturier the winner of the stage. Maurice Garin finished second, which made him the overall winner.|$|E
5|$|It has {{not been}} said of any people on the earth that the moon was {{observed}} that night such {{that it could be}} stated that it was not split. Even if this had been reported from many different places, so that one would have to <b>exclude</b> <b>the</b> possibility that all agreed upon a lie, yet, we would not accept this as proof to the contrary, for the moon is not seen in the same way by different people... An eclipse is visible in one country but not in the other one; in one place it is total, in the other one only partial.|$|E
5|$|Matthias {{participated in}} the lengthy Palm Sunday {{ceremony}} in Vienna in 1490, although he had felt so ill that morning {{that he could not}} eat breakfast. Around noon, he tasted a fig that proved to be rotten and he became very agitated and suddenly felt faint. The next day he was unable to speak. After two days of suffering, Matthias died in the morning of 6 April. According to Professor Frigyes Korányi, Matthias died of a stroke; Dr. Herwig Egert does not <b>exclude</b> <b>the</b> possibility of poisoning.
