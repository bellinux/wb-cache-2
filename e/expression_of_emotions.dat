5|$|During the Enlightenment and its {{debates about}} human origins, it became fashionable to {{speculate}} {{about the origin of}} language. Thinkers such as Rousseau and Herder argued that language had originated in the instinctive <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>emotions,</b> and that it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical expression of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as Kant and Descartes held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began to wonder about the role of language in shaping our experiences of the world– asking whether language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates concepts that it in turn imposes on our experience of the objective world. This led {{to the question of whether}} philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially the study of language, is associated with what has been called the linguistic turn and philosophers such as Wittgenstein in 20th-century philosophy. These debates about language in relation to meaning and reference, cognition and consciousness remain active today.|$|E

40|$|In {{cognitive}} science and neuroscience, {{there have been}} two leading models describing how humans perceive and classify facial <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> – the continuous and the categorical model.

50|$|According to Niedenthal, the {{perception}} <b>of</b> facial <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> {{can be affected}} by emotional states among many factors. In accordance with attachment orientation Niedenthal has proposed that lower level cognitive processes of perception such as {{the timing of the}} perceived offset <b>of</b> facial <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> influence {{the perception}} <b>of</b> facial <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> different <b>emotions</b> such as happiness, anger, fear, and sadness.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that avoiding the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> {{may be associated with}} impaired mental health, although empirical evidence is inconsistent. In this investigation, ambivalence over the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> is understood as an approach-avoidance conflict between a desire to express emotion and a fear of experiencing negative consequences. Consistent with a diathesis-stress model of depression, we assumed that in stressful situations strong ambivalence over the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> constitutes an intrapersonal vulnerability for the development of depressiveness. In a cross-sectional survey with an at-risk sample of 112 unemployed subjects, ambivalence over the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> statistically moderated the prediction of depressiveness by insufficient need satisfaction/stress. The present study provides initial support for the notion that strong ambivalence over the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> may impede subjects’ potential to cope with extreme stressors such as unemployment and may foster associated depressive states. Psychological interventions in this population may identify and target individual sources of ambivalence contingent on unemployment...|$|R

40|$|Background : One of the {{emotional}} factors involved in major depressive disorder is recognition <b>of</b> facial <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>emotion.</b> The aim <b>of</b> {{present study was to}} compare the recognition <b>of</b> facial <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> in patients with major depressive disorder and normal people. Materials and Methods: 20 patients with major depression and 20 normal people were selected using available sampling method and responded to Ekman and Frisen (1976) recognition <b>of</b> facial <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> test (α= 0. 71). The Method of this project was case- control and multivariate analysis of variance was used for data analysis. Results: The findings showed that {{there was a significant difference}} between normal (M= 26. 95, SD= 2. 68) and depressed (M= 22. 65, SD= 3. 97) subjects in terms of recognition <b>of</b> facial <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> (P<. 05), so normal people was better than people with major depressive disorder in terms of this variable. Conclusion: The defect in recognition <b>of</b> facial <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> is a construction which can have a significant role in deterioration of major depression symptoms...|$|R

60|$|SIR,--Although {{a perfect}} {{stranger}} to you, and {{living on the}} reverse side of the globe, I have taken the liberty of writing to you on a small discovery I have made in binocular vision in the stereoscope. I find by taking two ordinary carre-de-visite photos of two different persons' faces, the portraits being about the same sizes, and looking about the same direction, and placing them in a stereoscope, the faces blend into one in a most remarkable manner, producing {{in the case of}} some ladies' portraits, in every instance, a decided improvement in beauty. The pictures were not taken in a binocular camera, and therefore do not stand out well, but by moving one or both until the eyes coincide in the stereoscope the pictures blend perfectly. If taken in a binocular camera for the purpose, each person being taken on one half of the negative, I am sure the results would be still more striking. Perhaps something might be made of this in regard to the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>emotions</b> in man and the lower animals, &c. I have not time or opportunities to make experiments, {{but it seems to me}} something might be made of this by photographing the faces of different animals, different races of mankind, &c. I think a stereoscopic view of one of the ape tribe and some low-caste human face would make a very curious mixture; also in the matter of crossing of animals and the resulting offspring. It seems to me something also might result in photos of husband and wife and children, &c. In any case, the results are curious, if it leads to nothing else. Should this come to anything you will no doubt acknowledge myself as suggesting the experiment, and perhaps send me some of the results. If not likely to come to anything, a reply would much oblige me.|$|E

Abstract: The theses is {{dedicated}} to facial <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> <b>emotions,</b> {{it begins with a}} brief introduction to the topic <b>of</b> <b>emotions</b> as one <b>of</b> the cognitive functions, there is a definition of the term, classification <b>of</b> <b>emotions</b> and their psychopathology, it briefly summarizes the various theories <b>of</b> <b>emotions.</b> The greater part of the theoretical section is devoted to basic emotions and their manifestation in the face, as well as the ability to recognize and imitate them. The theoretical part is closed by the topic of emotional intelligence as a unifying element that highlights the importance of this issue. Empirical part is primarily focused on two abilities related to facial <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> <b>emotions,</b> specifically the recognition and the production of them, then links these capabilities with additional characteristics as the gender, the education and their self-estimation. The main finding of this theses {{is that there is a}} statistical significant relationship (ρ= 0. 35, α= 0. 05) between the emotion recognition and production.

Darwin claimed that the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>emotions</b> involves many systems: facial expression, behavioral response, and physical responses, which include physiological, postural, and vocal changes. Most importantly, Darwin claimed that emotional expression was consistent with his theories on evolution and thus, the expression of emotion is universal and should therefore be expressed similarly across race or culture. This {{is known as the}} universality hypothesis. Lastly, primates and animals exhibit precursors of muscle actions of the facial expressions of humans.|$|E
