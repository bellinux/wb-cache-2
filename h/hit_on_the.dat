5|$|On October 10, the Americans {{spotted a}} large house in Yorktown. Believing that Cornwallis might be {{stationed}} there, they aimed {{at it and}} quickly destroyed it.

5|$|The Do 217s trailed {{the fleet}} for some time, but the Italian fleet did not open fire upon {{sighting}} them; they were trailing the fleet {{at such a}} distance {{that it was impossible}} to identify them as Allied or Axis, and Bergamini believed that they were the air cover promised to them by the Allies. However, an attack upon Italia and Roma at 15:37 spurred the fleet into action, as the anti-aircraft batteries onboard opened fire and all ships began evasive maneuvers. About fifteen minutes after this, Italia was <b>hit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> starboard side underneath her fore main turrets, while Roma was <b>hit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same side somewhere between frames 100 and 108. This bomb passed through the ship and exploded beneath the keel, damaging the hull girder and allowing water to flood the after engine room and two boiler rooms. The flooding caused the inboard propellers to stop for want of power and started a large amount of arcing, which itself caused many electrical fires in the aft half of the ship.|$|E
5|$|The inquest into Sandra Rivett's death {{opened on}} 13November 1974 and {{was led by}} the Coroner for Inner West London, Gavin Thurston.

5|$|The {{next day}} {{as part of}} his promise to Bhuvan, Lakha takes a diving one-handed catch. However, the British score almost 300 runs, losing only three wickets by the lunch break. Kachra is brought back to bowl and, bowling with a now-worn ball, takes a hat-trick, which sparks the {{collapse}} of the British batting side. The villagers soon start their innings. Bhuvan and Deva (a Sikh, who has played cricket earlier when he was a British sepoy) give their team a solid start. Deva misses out on his half-century when a straight-drive from Bhuvan ricochets off the bowler's hand onto the stumps at the non-striker's end, where Deva is backing up too far. When Lakha comes on to bat, he is <b>hit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head by a bouncer and falls onto his stumps. Other batsmen get out rashly trying to score a boundary off each delivery. Ismail (Raj Zutshi), a good batsman, retires hurt as he is <b>hit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> leg. The villagers' team ends the day with four batsmen out of action with barely a third of the required runs on board.|$|E
