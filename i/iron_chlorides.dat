40|$|This project aims at resolving two {{significant}} industrial and environmental problems that face {{many parts of}} the world today: The emission of electric arc furnace dust (EAFD) and the disposal of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) waste. EAFD is an industrial metal waste originated from the steel industry, while PVC waste is accumulated due to the formation of many waste sources, particularly from the construction business. Both wastes are hazardous and have a high leachability propensity to the surrounding environment. Thus the regulations of disposal of these materials have become highly strict EAFD contains valuable metals such as zinc, lead and iron. In addition, PVC can be used as a source of hydrochloric acid (HCl) when pyrolyzed. Since zinc and iron are found within EAFD mainly as oxides, the main concept utilized in this study is to use HCl produced from PVC to react with these metal oxides to form zinc and <b>iron</b> <b>chlorides.</b> Once zinc and <b>iron</b> <b>chlorides</b> are formed, the separation of iron chloride and zinc chloride in water can be achieved since they have different solubility in water. Zinc chloride has a higher solubility in water than iron chloride. This process would be carried out through thermal treatment of the EAFD with the PVC waste.
