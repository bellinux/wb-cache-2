We termed the classes with high error rates as critical classes. Different groups of tuples have been formed for different classes.

40|$|Although it {{is known}} that {{responses}} in the auditory cortex are evoked predominantly contralateral to the side of stimulation, the lateralization of responses at lower levels in the human central auditory system has hardly been studied. Furthermore, little is known on the functional interactions between the involved processing centers. In this study, functional MRI was performed using sound stimuli of varying left and right intensities. In normal hearing subjects, contralateral activation was consistently detected in the temporal lobe, thalamus and midbrain. Connectivity analyses showed that auditory information crosses to the contralateral side in the lower brainstem followed by ipsilateral signal conduction towards the auditory cortex, similar to the flow of auditory signals in other mammals. In unilaterally deaf subjects, activation was more symmetrical for the cortices but remained contralateral in the midbrain and thalamus. <b>Input</b> <b>connection</b> strengths were different only at cortical levels, and there was no evidence for plastic reorganization at subcortical levels.

Each of these ports would be required to be either non-electrical (e. g., optically isolated) or electrically isolated.

40|$|Multisensory {{enhancement}} (MSE) is the augmentation of {{the response}} to sensory stimulation of one modality by stimulation of a different modality. It has been described for multisensory neurons in the deep superior colliculus (DSC) of mammals, which function to detect, and direct orienting movements toward, the sources of stimulation (targets). MSE would seem to improve the ability of DSC neurons to detect targets, but many mammalian DSC neurons are unimodal. MSE requires descending input to DSC from certain regions of parietal cortex. Paradoxically, the descending projections necessary for MSE originate from unimodal cortical neurons. MSE, and the puzzling findings associated with it, can be simulated using {{a model of the}} corticotectal system. In the model, a network of DSC units receives primary sensory input that can be augmented by modulatory cortical <b>input.</b> <b>Connection</b> weights from primary and modulatory inputs are trained in stages one (Hebb) and two (Hebb–anti-Hebb), respectively, of an unsupervised two-stage algorithm. Two-stage training causes DSC units to extract information concerning simulated targets from their inputs. It also causes the DSC to develop a mixture of unimodal and multisensory units. The percentage of DSC multisensory units is determined by the proportion of cross-modal targets and by primary input ambiguity. Multisensory DSC units develop MSE, which depends on unimodal modulatory connections. Removal of the modulatory influence greatly reduces MSE but has little effect on DSC unit responses to stimuli of a single modality. The correspondence between model and data suggests that two-stage training captures important features of self-organization in the real corticotectal system.

40|$|In the {{classical}} model of Random Boolean Networks (RBN) {{the number of}} incoming connectionsis the same for every node, while the distribution of outgoing links is Poissonian. TheseRBN are known to display two major dynamical behaviours, depending upon the value of somemodel parameters: an “ordered” and a “chaotic” regime. We introduce a modi 7 cation of theclassical way of building a RBN, which maintains the property that all the nodes have the samenumber of incoming links, but which {{gives rise to a}} scale-free distribution of outgoing connections. Because of this modi 7 cation, the dynamical properties are deeply modi 7 ed: the number ofattractors is much smaller than in classical RBN, their length and the duration of the transientsare shorter. Moreover, the number of di 8 erent attractors is almost independent of the networksize, over almost three orders of magnitudes (while in classical RBN this number grows with thesize of the network).

Here we address the reason why such a simple model actuallyworks: we present a theoretical study of the distribution of avalanches and show that, {{in the case of a}} Poissonian distribution of outgoinglinks, their distribution is determined by the value of the Derrida exponent.

40|$|This thesis has an {{objective}} {{aimed to develop}} a functional real-time visualization of an underwater robot manipulator, and present the relevant theory and steps related to this system. Then the system should be prepared for connection to a real robot manipulator. Such a system is important for increased safety in underwater operations and to improve the operator s situation awareness. The manipulator that was modeled and tested in this thesis was an 'Raptor - Force Feedback Manipulator' produced by Kraft TeleRobotics. To develop the system {{it was important to}} choose the right software for use, and verify that the end product was working properly. Errors in the system can be critical in a real situation where an operator trusts the information that the software provides. Also the consequences of an accident during operation can be fatal for human safety and the environment. With a 3 D model of the manipulator received from the manufacturer, it was possible to analyze and take measurements of the manipulator for use in the visualization software. The software that was chosen was the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework. This framework has a huge amount of opportunities including monitoring and visualization of robotic systems, which makes it a good choice both for this thesis and in terms of further development. It has not been used much in underwater robotics, but arguments for not using it hasn't been revealed during the work with this thesis. By using basic kinematic theory and the Denavit-Hartenberg representation the forward kinematics for the arm was derived and explained in detail. It is important to know this theory when implementing the model into the software. Measurements from the analysis of the model and CAD-files (Computer-aided design) was applied and described in URDF-files (Unified Robot Description Format) so that it could be imported into the software. The software solution was configured and customized to be easy and intuitive in use, and an explanation of how to run and test the system was included. In addition, the hardware set-up and procedures for how to connect the software to a real manipulator was produced and documented. To verify that the system was working properly, simulated events was conducted for each part of the model. These simulations confirmed that the system was acting as wished. With the real manipulator up and running, this software should be ready for use with just a little effort put into the signal <b>input</b> <b>connection...</b>|$|E
40|$|Spike timing {{dependent}} plasticity (STDP) {{has been}} observed experimentally in vitro and is a widely studied neural algorithm for synaptic modification. While the functional role of STDP has been investigated extensively, the effect of rhythms on the precise timing of STDP has not been characterized as well. We use a simplified biophysical model of a cortical network that generates pyramidal interneuronal gamma rhythms (PING). Plasticity via STDP is investigated at the excitatory pyramidal cell synapse from a gamma frequency (30 – 90 Hz) input independent of the network gamma rhythm. The input may represent a corticocortical or an information-specific thalamocortical connection. This synapse is mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor mediated (NMDAR) currents. For distinct network and input frequencies, the model shows robust frequency regimes of potentiation and depression, providing a mechanism by which responses to certain inputs can potentiate while responses to other inputs depress. For potentiating regimes, the model suggests an optimal amount and duration of plasticity that can occur, which depends on the time course for the decay of the postsynaptic NMDAR current. Prolonging {{the duration of the}} input beyond this optimal time results in depression. Inserting pauses in the input can increase the total potentiation. The optimal pause length corresponds to the decay time of the NMDAR current. Thus, STDP in this model provides a mechanism for potentiation and depression depending on input frequency and suggests that the slow NMDAR current decay helps to regulate the optimal amplitude and duration of the plasticity. The optimal pause length is comparable to the time scale of the negative phase of a modulatory theta rhythm, which may pause gamma rhythm spiking. Our pause results may suggest a novel role for this theta rhythm in plasticity. Finally, we discuss our results in the context of auditory thalamocortical plasticity. Author Summary Rhythms are well studied phenomena in many animal species. Brain rhythms in the gamma frequency range (30 – 90 Hz) are thought {{to play a role in}} attention and memory. In this paper, we are interested in how cortical gamma rhythms interact with information specific inputs that also have a significant gamma frequency component. The results from our computational model show that plasticity associated with learning depends on the specific frequencies of the input and cortical gamma rhythms. The results show a mechanism by which both increases and decreases in the strength of the <b>input</b> <b>connection</b> can occur, depending on the specific frequency of the input. A current mediated by NMDA receptors may be responsible for the temporal course of the plasticity seen in these brain regions.
