An addendum released in August 2000 analyzed increased service (on all modes) to Fenway Park on game days. Possibilities studied included running game day service from the Plymouth/Kingston Line with an unused trainset, a South Station-Yawkey shuttle, increased Green Line service, and bus shuttles to the Red Line in Cambridge and to Ruggles station.

The Chennai port facility is expected to be on the lines of its Ulsan Port, from where it exports half of Korea's 1,500,000 vehicles annually. The export terminal at the Chennai port would cater to its total export target of 300,000 cars, which would be 50 per cent of its total production by 2009–10. The company has plans to develop the land into a <b>dedicated</b> <b>terminal</b> to serve as an export base.

40|$|Globalization, liberalization, {{competition}} and spatial interaction are significant factors affecting {{the transformation of}} manufacturing industries worldwide. In the transportation and logistics industry, however, cooperation is becoming even more critical than competition in determining firms’ efficiency. Cooperation has always characterized the liner sector in which strategic alliances, mergers and acquisitions have generated twin effects: notable increases in ship size and falls in freight rates. Meanwhile, the stevedoring industry is undergoing privatizationdriven consolidation {{and the emergence of}} global pure terminal operators. This article focuses on vertical integration between global carriers and terminal operators. We address the following key current issues:. <b>dedicated</b> <b>terminals</b> as a strategy for cutting costs and controlling integrated transport chains;. the struggle for supply chain control, involving global carriers versus global terminal operators, driven by financial power and technical and managerial capability. We close analysing one of the core problems of the market, namely the evolving role of the <b>dedicated</b> <b>terminals.</b> For the pure stevedores they represent an opportunity to secure a cargo, while {{in the hands of the}} liners they enable cost stability and the possibility to put pressure on pure terminal operators...|$|R

50|$|A fifth terminal, Terminal 5, will {{be ready}} {{in the next decade}} as {{announced}} by Transport Minister, Lui Tuck Yew on 7 May 2013. Terminal 5 will be built on 1,080 hectares of reclaimed land in Changi East, {{making it one of the}} largest terminals in the world. The terminal could handle a capacity of 50 million passengers annually. With the addition of the fifth terminal, Changi Airport will be able to cater to more than 135 million passengers every year. With the national carrier at Terminal 5, each alliance of airlines such as SkyTeam and Oneworld could also operate out of <b>dedicated</b> <b>terminals.</b> Terminal 5 is also expected to have more self-service facilities and bigger lounges. Terminal 5 will be linked to the other terminals at Changi Airport. This will allow the expanded Changi Airport to be operated as a single, integrated airport for ease of transfer between different terminals, maximum passenger convenience and airfield operational efficiency.|$|R
