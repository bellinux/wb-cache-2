5|$|Sir Francis and {{his wife}} were Protestants. In 1556 they went to Frankfurt in Germany to escape {{religious}} persecution under Queen Mary I, taking five of their children with them. It is unknown whether Lettice was among them, and she may <b>have</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> next few years in the household of Princess Elizabeth with whom the family had a close relationship since the mid-1540s. They returned to England in January 1559, two months after Elizabeth I's succession. Francis Knollys was appointed Vice-Chamberlain of the Royal Household; Lady Knollys became a senior Lady of the Bedchamber, and her daughter Lettice a Maid of the Privy Chamber.|$|E
5|$|Predators of waders {{breeding}} in wet grasslands include birds such {{as large}} gulls, common raven, carrion and hooded crows, and great and Arctic skuas; foxes occasionally take waders, {{and the impact}} of feral cats and stoats is unknown. Overgrazing can increase predation by making nests easier to find. In captivity, the main causes of chick mortality were stress-related sudden death and twisted neck syndrome. Adults seem to show little evidence of external parasites, but may have significant levels of disease on their tropical wintering grounds, including avian malaria in their inland freshwater habitats, and so they might be expected to invest strongly in their immune systems; however, a 2006 study that analysed the blood of migrating ruffs intercepted in Friesland showed that this bird actually has unexplained low levels of immune responses on at least one measure of resistance. The ruff can breed from its second year, and the average lifespan for birds that <b>have</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> chick stage is about 4.4 years, although a Finnish bird lived to a record 13 years and 11 months.|$|E
