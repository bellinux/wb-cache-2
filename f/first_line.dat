5|$|Despite the poem's {{doubt and}} darkness, {{a note of}} hope is struck by the <b>first</b> <b>line</b> of the fifth section, 'So here I am in the middle way'. This refers to the <b>first</b> <b>line</b> of Dante's Inferno, 'Midway in our life's journey, I went astray'. Although the descent is {{predicated}} on going astray, so also is persevering beyond it into the light.|$|E
5|$|During {{the fights}} for the ramparts of Wola, only {{artillery}} {{of the second}} line gave limited support to the outnumbered Polish troops. Krukowiecki claimed after the war that he ordered Dembiński, Bem and General Franciszek Młokosiewicz to support the <b>first</b> <b>line,</b> but apparently none of them received the order. General Ludwik Bogusławski, commander of the 3rd Infantry Division manning the second line, could have supported the forts of the <b>first</b> <b>line,</b> {{but he could not}} see what was happening in Fort 56 due to dense smoke and the trees of Brühl's Garden.|$|E
5|$|In a 2009 poll {{conducted}} by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center and publicized just two days before Russia's flag day (22 August), 56% of respondents stated that they felt proud when hearing the national anthem. However, only 39% could recall {{the words of the}} <b>first</b> <b>line</b> of the anthem. This was an increase from 33% in 2007. According to the survey, between 34 and 36% could not identify the anthem's <b>first</b> <b>line.</b> Overall, only 25% of respondents said they liked the anthem.|$|E

5|$|The {{departure}} of regular units under Ramorino and Łubieński depleted {{the forces of}} the defenders, further weakening the crew manning the <b>first</b> <b>line</b> of defence. The garrison dropped to 28,000 regular soldiers and 10,000 fresh troops, poorly trained and often armed only with scythes.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbering}} of the Territorial Force battalions {{was laid}} down by War Office instructions issued in 1914 and 1915. On joining the Territorial Force men {{were asked if they}} would serve overseas (foreign service) or just volunteered for service in the United Kingdom (home service) and their service records amended accordingly. At the declaration of war all Territorial battalions were mobilised and on 15 August 1914 the War Office issued instructions for those men who had volunteered for foreign service to be separated out into what were called <b>first</b> <b>line</b> battalions. Home service men were placed in second line battalions. Thus there would now be a <b>first</b> <b>line</b> 5th Battalion and a second line 5th Battalion. On 24 November 1914, as the <b>first</b> <b>line</b> battalions began to go overseas, additional instructions were issued allowing the raising of a third line battalion once the <b>first</b> <b>line</b> battalion was on foreign service. In January 1915 these designations were simplified and the battalions called the 1/5th, 2/5th and 3/5th battalions respectively.|$|E

5|$|A tram {{network has}} long been planned in Skopje and the idea was first {{proposed}} in the 1980s. The project became real in 2006 when the mayor Trifun Kostovski asked for feasibility studies.

5|$|Across the battlefield, as the <b>first</b> <b>line</b> of Persian ships {{was pushed}} {{back by the}} Greeks, they became fouled in the {{advancing}} second and third lines of their own ships. On the Greek left, the Persian admiral Ariabignes (a brother of Xerxes) was killed early in the battle; left disorganised and leaderless, the Phoenician squadrons {{appear to have been}} pushed back against the coast, many vessels running aground. In the centre, a wedge of Greek ships pushed through the Persians lines, splitting the fleet in two.|$|E

5|$|In {{this type}} of legion, the 900 principes formed 15 maniples, {{military}} units of 60 men each. The principes stood in the second battle line, behind hastati of the <b>first</b> <b>line</b> {{and in front of}} the triarii in the third. In a pitched battle, the leves, javelin armed light infantry would form up {{at the front of the}} legion and harass the enemy with javelin fire to cover the advance of the hastati, light spearmen.|$|E
5|$|Operation Badr {{called for}} an {{enlargement}} of the bridgeheads on October 8. To accomplish this, {{each of the five}} infantry divisions had to reorganize its forces. Mechanized infantry brigades in the second echelon of divisional lines were to advance between the two forward infantry brigades. Thus the mechanized brigade would form the <b>first</b> <b>line,</b> the two infantry brigades would form the second line, and the reserve armored brigade would constitute a third echelon.|$|E
5|$|The Canucks <b>first</b> <b>line</b> {{struggled}} to {{score in the}} playoffs, however. In 12 games, Burrows scored three goals, two of which were into empty nets, and notched three assists.

It was revealed in the off-season that Burrows was suffering from a shoulder injury, which he later received surgery for.|$|E

5|$|The body's <b>first</b> <b>line</b> of defence against viruses is {{the innate}} immune system. This {{comprises}} cells and other mechanisms that defend the host from infection in a non-specific manner.

5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>line</b> {{therapy for}} aphthous {{stomatitis}} is topical agents rather than systemic medication, with topical corticosteroids being the mainstay treatment. Systemic treatment is {{usually reserved for}} severe disease due {{to the risk of}} adverse side effects associated with many of these agents. A systematic review found that no single systemic intervention was found to be effective. Good oral hygiene is important to prevent secondary infection of the ulcers.|$|E
