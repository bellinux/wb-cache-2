Like most Hurley episodes, {{it features a}} lot of very sweet, funny material. But it {{is a bit of a}} time killer between two really fantastic hours." [...] The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ rating and stated that [...] "it's enough for me. I don't <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> but I'm ready to get Lost again." ...|$|E
500|$|One of Usher's {{first steps}} in {{recording}} Confessions was deciding to reveal [...] "his own little secrets". Friend and former A rep named Kawan [...] "KP" [...] Prather thought the album {{would let the}} public know Usher personally. Prather said, [...] "The music {{has never been the}} question, but people tend to buy into the artist. The more they <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> the more they feel like they're there with you." [...] Primarily because of the album's personal content, Usher said that this is his chance to be real. He named the album Confessions because he felt it is his most personal record to date: [...] "All of us have our Pandora's boxes or skeletons in our closets. I let a few of them out, you know. I've got a lot to say. I've got a lot of things and stuff built in me that I just want to let go of." [...] He wrote more songs than he contributed to his previous album.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] {{speaks about}} {{two women who}} chose not to end a {{friendship}} because {{of a man who}} has cheated both of them. Its theme is one of female independence. Beyoncé told MTV News that [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] is about female empowerment, in keeping with the theme of the album: [...] "It's about a guy who's kind of playing both of us, and instead of us arguing over the guy we say, 'Forget him. Let's stick together. He's a beautiful liar." [...] The chorus features the lines, [...] "Let's not kill the karma, let's not start a fight" [...] with the female protagonists bonding in their mutual betrayal. Beyoncé and Shakira sing with staccato, intense vocal approach throughout the song. Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "I didn't <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> then, till I saw you with him again" [...] earnestly while Shakira later adds [...] "I walked in on your love scene, slow dancing". In the end, the female protagonists conclude, [...] "we can live without him", referring to their cheating lover.|$|E

500|$|Writing for AOL TV, Laura Prudom {{noted that}} the episode [...] "proved to be an undeniably {{satisfying}} hour of television, deepening our understanding of Archie/Jiminy's character and giving us some welcome development in Mary Margaret and David's tragic romance. I don't <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> but I really could watch a whole hour of those two playing hangman and innocently flirting and need nothing else from the show." [...] Entertainment Weekly columnist Shaunna Murphy wrote that while she [...] "ragged on Robert Carlyle initially, his campy Rumpel is quickly becoming {{one of my favorite}} parts of this show." [...] Tor.com's Teresa Jusino called Espenson's script [...] "so engaging" [...] because it deviated from the series' typical two-story format and [...] "incorporated a third, separate modern storyline" [...] that featured other characters in addition to Jiminy Cricket, in which [...] "each storyline got just enough attention." [...] She added that the episode's best parts were its [...] "intimate character moments, particularly the scenes between Archie/Jiminy and the boys in his life," [...] and attributed this to Espenson's strength as a writer. Jusino felt another highlight was Sbarge's performance, as he [...] "navigated both Archie and Jiminy’s journeys from being pawns to being their own men with precision and warmth." ...|$|E

It concludes with the Niagara Falls crossing. [...] "One of the challenges of writing a book", Wallenda commented, [...] "is there's things you probably don't want people to <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>you...</b> It was very emotional telling these stories at times... It {{is a challenge to}} reveal your life story." ...|$|E

During the phase of the trial in which Bradford acted as his own attorney, he offered no {{evidence}} or arguments as to his innocence. The prosecution identified Bradford as a serial killer {{during the course of}} the trial, but offered no information on murders aside from those of Miller and Campbell. In his closing statement, Bradford implied that he had murdered several other women in addition to Campbell and Miller: [...] "Think of how many you don't even <b>know</b> <b>about.</b> <b>You</b> are so right.

2500|$|One of Buck's final public {{appearances}} was on September 17, 2001 at Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis. It {{was the first}} night that Major League Baseball resumed {{after the terrorist attacks}} of September 11. Although looking rather frail (Buck at the time was sick with lung cancer) and struggling to maintain his composure (Buck was obviously showing the signs of Parkinson's disease as well), Buck stirred emotions by reading a patriotic-themed poem during the pregame ceremonies. He concluded by silencing critics who thought baseball had come back too soon: [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> but as for me, the question has already been answered: Should we be here?

His [...] "Ballad With a Tendency" [...] was bitterly criticised by Saltykov-Schedrin while [...] magazine parodied it in 1872 with a verse entitled [...] "A Ballad with a Pro-Police Tendency". Shchedrin, describing {{the current state of}} Russian literature as a [...] "kingdom of scoundrels", in a letter to Aleksey Zhemchuzhnikov wrote: [...] "Add to all this the fun-and-games-seeking 'free artists' like Count A.

2500|$|Matt Smith's {{portrayal}} of the Doctor was met with critical acclaim.

In his review for The Daily Telegraph, Gavin Fuller noted that [...] "Matt Smith's 'quick-paced delivery' is 'a major facet' {{of the success of the}} current series." [...] In his review of [...] "The Big Bang", Fuller once again praised Smith's acting. [...] "Matt Smith was superb in his scenes where the Doctor sacrifices himself in the Pandorica to rescue the multiverse". Kyle Anderson of Nerdist wrote [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> all, but the Eleventh Doctor was MY Doctor." [...] Dan Martin of The Guardian also claimed Smith as [...] "my ultimate Doctor." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pundits accused Dole {{of being}} a [...] "flip-flopper and a hypocrite." [...] Editorials ran in major newspapers, {{including}} The Washington Post, The New York Times, the Boston Globe, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and the Times of London, condemning Dole's action, joined by radio commentators Rush Limbaugh and Don Imus. [...] Under the pressure, Dole admitted during an October 1995 press briefing on Capitol Hill that he regretted the decision to return the check, and that his campaign was responsible for it without consulting him. [...] "I think if they'd have consulted me, we wouldn't have done that, wouldn't have returned it," [...] Dole said. Dole later told Washington Post editor and author Bob Woodward that the LCR episode was a [...] "mistake" [...] because the decision to return the check [...] "gets into Bob Dole the person. [...] It's {{not so much about}} Bob Dole the candidate. It's the person. [...] Is he tolerant? [...] Does he tolerate different views? [...] Tolerate someone with a different lifestyle?"

2500|$|Over {{the course}} of the 1990s, Jack Buck decided to reduce his {{schedule}} to calling only Cardinals home games (or 81 games a year unless there was a special occurrence). Health concerns obviously could have played a factor in this, as Buck suffered from such ailments as Parkinson's disease, diabetes, requiring a pacemaker, cataracts, sciatica, and vertigo. Buck once joked, [...] "I wish I'd get Alzheimer's, then I could forget I've got all the other stuff." [...] In 1998, the Cardinals dedicated a bust of Buck that showed him smiling with a hand cupping his left ear. In 1999, he lent his name to a restaurant venture called J. Buck's, with the restaurant's name being shared with son Joe and daughter Julie. One of Buck's final public appearances was on September 17, 2001 at Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis.
