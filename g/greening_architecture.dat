The development of the construction of hotels in Solo increasing, with responses from the issue of global warming and the reduction of green land in the city of Solo. So the design of a city hotel brings the concept of <b>green</b> <b>architecture.</b> By minimizing the negative impact of buildings on the design of nature, the environment and humans. Reduction in green areas in the city were replaced by buildings, so it is necessary to put the public green space into the building as an alternative communal space. 	Final of the planning process is the following problem formulation: "How to create a Green City Hotel of Surakarta be able to become a building five-star hotel with the implementation of <b>Green</b> <b>Architecture,</b> which provides special facilities in terms of the convention, as well as be able to apply the cultural nuances of Solo into the building, it will make a difference with hotels another in the city of Solo " The issues raised: 1.

40|$|What {{does it mean}} “green” architecture? Ecological? Sustainable? Devoid of CO 2 emission? Lots of trees? Integrated {{into the}} environment? Low energy impact? Probably <b>green</b> <b>architecture</b> means {{everything}} together, and…more. The <b>green</b> <b>architecture</b> is a new trend of architecture or, perhaps, {{a component of the}} Architecture itself in our time? A first consideration requires to consider how the building traditions of a people has certainly a wealth of features "green" even if they belong to the past and often forgotten. From the European building tradition derived typical solutions such as for residential applications common to different countries. The same use of light, and not just air, was considered one of the basic elements of a design that would maximize the contribution of natural resources, such as the air, the green, the sun. Designing and building <b>green</b> <b>architecture</b> is an important opportunity to upgrade the tradition and to rethink {{the quality of life in}} our homes and cities. For the actors in the current architectural landscape it is necessary to obtain, effectively, an integration between the “new” green criteria and the existing knowledge. While, in the past, we have talked about “integrated design”, today is affirmed a more scientific meaning of this integration, the concept of “holistic design”. One problem, whatever it is, must be faced and solved considering all aspects involved, in substance by all disciplines that help to define it. The <b>Green</b> <b>Architecture</b> is therefore able to offer a whole different contributions (economics, cultural technical, social,…) to the construction world, and in addition <b>Green</b> <b>Architecture</b> is emerging not only as a way to build, but also as a way of life. We believe that, beyond the current needs (and architectural trends), green (the green factor) should therefore return to be one of the factors always present in architecture design and construction. In other words, any project or architectural construction of high level will be, henceforth, designed in a holistic manner as green. A green approach to the built environment involves a holistic approach to the design of buildings...|$|R
