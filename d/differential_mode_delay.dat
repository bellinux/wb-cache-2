This measurement variability is due to the combination of differences in laser output characteristics (emitted mode power distribution) and the <b>differential</b> <b>mode</b> <b>delay</b> of the fiber. <b>Differential</b> <b>mode</b> <b>delay</b> is the difference in the time delays amongst the fiber's propagating modes caused by imperfections or nonideality of the fiber refractive index profile.|$|E

40|$|We {{report for}} the first time on the {{limitations}} in the operational power range of few-mode fiber based transmission systems, employing 28 Gbaud quadrature phase shift keying transponders, over 1, 600 km. It is demonstrated that if an additional mode is used on a preexisting few-mode transmission link, and allowed to optimize its performance, it will have a significant impact on the pre-existing mode. In particular, we show that for low mode coupling strengths (weak coupling regime), the newly added variable power mode does not considerably impact the fixed power existing mode, with performance penalties less than 2 dB (in Q-factor). On the other hand, as mode coupling strength is increased (strong coupling regime), the individual launch power optimization significantly degrades the system performance, with penalties up to ∼ 6 dB. Our results further suggest that mutual power optimization, of both fixed power and variable power modes, reduces power allocation related penalties to less than 3 dB, for any given coupling strength, for both high and low <b>differential</b> <b>mode</b> <b>delays...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Selective {{excitation}} of graded-index multimode fibers (GIMMFs) with a {{single-mode fiber}} (SMF) has gained increased interest for telecommunication applications. It {{has been proposed}} {{as a way to}} enhance the transmission bandwidth of GI-MMF links and/or create parallel communication channels over the same GI-MMF. Although the effect of SMF excitation on the transmission bandwidth has been investigated, its impact on the near-field intensity pattern at the output face of the GI-MMF has not been systematically addressed. We have carried out an analysis of the near-field intensity pattern at the output face of silica-based GI-MMFs excited by a radially offset SMF. Simulation results exhibit all of the features displayed by experimental ones. It turns out that <b>differential</b> <b>mode</b> attenuation and <b>delay,</b> full intra-group <b>mode</b> mixing, and small deviations in the refractive index profile of the GI-MMF do not affect the overall shape of the near-field intensity, which is determined by the radial offset of the input SMF.

40|$|Abstract—It is {{clarified}} for {{the first}} time that the effect of the mode coupling on the bandwidth characteristic is very small in the graded-index polymer optical fiber (GI POF) compared with in the step-index (SI) POF. Although there have been several trials regarding the theoretical prediction of bandwidth characteristics of the GI POF, a disagreement between measured and estimated properties was observed. The origin of disagreement has been gen-erally explained as the mode coupling effect. However, it is clari-fied in this paper that the effect of the differential mode attenua-tion is the dominant factor of disagreement between measured and predicted bandwidth characteristics, while the effect of the mode coupling is small. In order to clarify the reason why the calculated bandwidth characteristics of the GI POF show a disagreement with that measured, <b>differential</b> <b>mode</b> <b>delay</b> and differential mode at-tenuation were investigated. It was found that the highest order mode in the poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) base GI POF atten-uated 17 dB compared with the lowest order mode through 100 -m transmission.

Two different types of refractive index profile have been considered: a graded-core with a cladding trench (GCCT) profile and a multi-step-index (MSI) profile. The profiles parameters are optimized in order to achieve: the lowest possible DMD and macro-bend losses (MBL) lower than the ITU-T standard recommendation. The optimization {{results show that the}} MSI profiles present lower DMD than the minimum achieved with a GCCT profile. Moreover, it is shown that the optimum DMD and the MBL scale with the number of modes for both profiles. The optimum DMD obtained for 12 LP modes is lower than 3 ps/km using a GCCT profile and lower than 2. 5 ps/km using a MSI profile.
