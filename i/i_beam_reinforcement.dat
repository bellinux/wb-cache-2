30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  2, {{the upper and}} lower {{longitudinal}} <b>beam</b> <b>reinforcements</b> are anchored mechanically into exterior columns to simulate continuity in external beam–column joints. Given the short length of the specimens, {{there was no need to}} use splices in the <b>beam</b> <b>reinforcements.</b> Longitudinal column reinforcements are anchored by 90 ° hooks inside the foundations. To prevent structural slippage, each foundation is attached to the strong laboratory floor using four threaded rods. The tops of the columns were mechanically anchored to the main frame to restrict displacements at these points. Downward displacement and rotation of the tops of the columns remained unrestrained.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the new method of the nondestructive diagnosis that investigates the rustiness degree of the <b>beam</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> The method {{is based on}} the difference of the rusty and "healthy" iron permittivity magnitude. Therefore, we can make conclusions about the presence of a rusty beam and the degree of its rustiness by measuring the electric capacity of the <b>beam</b> <b>reinforcement</b> section. In order to increase the reliability of the diagnosis results we suggest setting the additional electrodes on the edges of the working measuring electrodes. These additional electrodes are not connected with the working measuring electrodes...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of beam-column joints {{have long been}} recognized as a significant factor that affects the overall behaviour of reinforced concrete (RC) framed structures subjected to large lateral loads. The reversal of forces in beam-column joints during earthquakes may cause distress and often failure, when not designed and detailed properly. In the present study, four one third scaled exterior beam-column joint specimens were prepared with {{only one of them}} conforming to the guide lines of IS 13920 : 1993 for seismic resistant design. Second one was detailed with additional diagonal collar stirrups at joints and <b>beam</b> <b>reinforcements</b> and the third one is cast without collar stirrups but having additional <b>beam</b> <b>reinforcements.</b> The fourth specimen was having same longitudinal reinforcements of the first specimen but with increased spacing of ties in the joint region. All the specimens were subjected to similar reverse cyclic loading to simulate earthquake loading in structures. The loading was applied by displacement control mode. Based on the experimental findings and subsequent analysis, it is found that, second specimen having additional <b>beam</b> <b>reinforcements</b> and diagonal collar stirrups at joints exhibits a better performance than the others.

40|$|When a {{beam flange}} is coped to allow {{clearance}} at the connection, {{the strength of}} the coped region will be reduced. Local web buckling at the coped region may occur when the cope length is long and/or the compression flange is braced. Experimental and analytical investigation of the strength of coped steel <b>I</b> <b>beams</b> were conducted by a number of researchers and design formula was also proposed. However, the proposed formula underestimates the local web buckling capacity of a coped <b>I</b> <b>beam,</b> especially when the cope-depth to beam-depth ratio is small. To improve this discrepancy, full-scale tests of the web buckling strength of coped steel <b>I</b> <b>beams</b> and a series of analytical studies were carried out. A modified plate buckling formula, which considers the shear buckling phenomenon at the coped region, is proposed. The modified formula gives a better prediction of the local web buckling strength of a coped <b>I</b> <b>beam.</b> The test-to-predicted ratios varies from 0. 92 to 1. 06.

Because of the larger stress gradient (α_s) along the bottom bars due to the unequal reinforcement ratio A_s,bot /A_s,top = 0.75, the minimum column dimension given by Eq. (3) and Table  1 would be determined by the bottom beam bars passing through the joint.|$|R
