5|$|Beyond: Two Souls is {{dedicated}} to composer Normand Corbeil, who died of pancreatic cancer on 25 January 2013. Corbeil had worked on Quantic Dream's Heavy Rain and its predecessor <b>Fahrenheit</b> {{and was unable to}} finish his work on Beyond. Lorne Balfe, who wrote the score for Assassin's Creed III, replaced Corbeil as the game's composer after Corbeil's death. Balfe's collaborator Hans Zimmer joined him as producer in August 2013.|$|E
5|$|Gardiner's health {{continued}} {{to be an issue}} throughout the 1934 NHL playoffs. On March 29, 1934 in a playoff game against the Montreal Maroons Gardiner had a shutout as the Black Hawks won 3–0; though he was named first star as the best player of the game, Gardiner was in extreme pain during the entire game with a fever of 102 <b>Fahrenheit</b> and was attended to by a doctor in the dressing room during intermissions.|$|E

5|$|Station model plots use {{a mixture}} of metric and Imperial units {{depending}} on the map's location and what is being shown. Surface maps in the United States primarily use Imperial units, such as inches, degrees <b>Fahrenheit,</b> and knots. Most of the world, however, uses metric measurements for everything but wind speed, which is shown in knots.|$|E
5|$|To left {{of center}} in the station model, the {{temperature}} and dew point are plotted. Within the United States on surface weather maps, they are still plotted in degrees <b>Fahrenheit.</b> Otherwise, {{they will be in}} units of degrees Celsius. This knowledge is important to meteorologists because when this data is plotted on a map, isotherms and isodrosotherms (lines of equal dew point) are easily analyzed, either by man or machine, which can help determine location of weather fronts.|$|E
5|$|Winters {{are cold}} and snowy; Utica {{receives}} lake-effect snow from Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. Utica is colder on average than other Great Lakes cities {{because of its}} location in a valley and susceptibility to north winds; temperatures in the single digits or below zero <b>Fahrenheit</b> are not uncommon on winter nights. Annual precipitation (based on a 30-year average from 1981–2010) is , falling on an average of 171 days.|$|E

5|$|All these bands {{played a}} part in {{developing}} the overall look and sound of glam metal during the early 1980s. In 1985, many more commercially successful glam metal albums began to appear. Mötley Crüe released Theatre of Pain, Ratt's second album Invasion of Your Privacy, Dokken's third album Under Lock and Key, Stryper's first release Soldiers Under Command, Bon Jovi's second release 7800° <b>Fahrenheit,</b> and Autograph's second album That's The Stuff. Los Angeles continued to foster the most important scene around the Sunset Strip, with groups like London, which had originally formed as a glam rock band in the 1970s, and had seen future members of Mötley Crüe, Cinderella and Guns N' Roses pass through its ranks, finally releasing their début album Non Stop Rock in 1985 as well.|$|E
5|$|Notable German {{physicists}} {{before the}} 20th century include Hermann von Helmholtz, Joseph von Fraunhofer and Gabriel Daniel <b>Fahrenheit,</b> among others. Albert Einstein introduced the special relativity and general relativity theories for light and gravity in 1905 and 1915 respectively. Along with Max Planck, he {{was instrumental in}} the introduction of quantum mechanics, in which Werner Heisenberg and Max Born later made major contributions. Wilhelm Röntgen discovered X-rays. Otto Hahn was a pioneer in the fields of radiochemistry and discovered nuclear fission, while Ferdinand Cohn and Robert Koch were founders of microbiology. Numerous mathematicians were born in Germany, including Carl Friedrich Gauss, David Hilbert, Bernhard Riemann, Gottfried Leibniz, Karl Weierstrass, Hermann Weyl and Felix Klein.|$|E
5|$|Temperature is {{a measure}} of the kinetic energy of a sample of matter. Temperature is the unique {{physical}} property that determines the direction of heat flow between two objects placed in thermal contact. If no heat flow occurs, the two objects have the same temperature; otherwise heat flows from the hotter object to the colder object. Temperature, within meteorology, is measured with thermometers exposed to the air but sheltered from direct solar exposure. In most of the world, the degree Celsius scale is used for most temperature measuring purposes. However, the United States is the last major country in which the degree <b>Fahrenheit</b> temperature scale is used by most lay people, industry, popular meteorology, and government. Despite this, METAR reports from the United States also report the temperature (and dewpoint, see below) in degrees Celsius.|$|E
5000|$|On <b>Fahrenheit's</b> 2nd album, Chen {{sang the}} rap {{part of the}} song 心裡有數. He {{recorded}} his first solo for The X Family soundtrack entitled 你是我所有的回憶. He also sang {{his own version of}} 超喜歡你 on his 2010 series 愛似百匯. He frequently sings <b>Fahrenheit's</b> [...] "Sexy Girl" [...] during fan events, like what happened on the [...] "When Love Walked In" [...] event. Chen is supposed to sing a solo for the drama [...] "When Love Walked In". Chen {{said in an interview that}} he plans to release his own solo album in late 2014 since his bandmates Aaron Yan and Jiro Wang have already released theirs.|$|R
25|$|Charles {{developed}} several useful inventions, {{including a}} valve to let hydrogen {{out of the}} balloon and other devices, such as the hydrometer and reflecting goniometer, and improved the Gravesand heliostat and <b>Fahrenheit's</b> aerometer. In addition he confirmed Benjamin Franklin's electrical experiments.|$|R
500|$|Hebe {{has earned}} three awards from six nominations, {{all of which}} have come from being a {{featured}} artist on <b>Fahrenheit's</b> song [...] "Only Have Feelings for You" [...] (只對你又感覺). At the 7th Global Chinese Music Awards, Hebe became the first S.H.E member to earn a nomination for Best Female Artist.|$|R
5|$|The {{official}} {{investigation by}} the FBI was aided by another prisoner, Allen West, {{who was part of}} the escapees' group but was left behind. West's false wall kept slipping so he held it in place with cement, which set. When Morris and the Anglins accelerated the schedule, West desperately chipped away at the wall, {{but by the time he}} got out, his companions were gone. Articles belonging to the prisoners, including plywood paddles and parts of the raincoat raft were discovered on nearby Angel Island. The FBI's investigation from 1962 to December 1979 was finally treated as closed. The official report on the escape concludes that the prisoners drowned in the cold waters of the bay while trying to reach the mainland, it being unlikely that they made it the 1.25 miles to shore due to the strong ocean currents and the cold sea water temperatures ranging between 50 and 55 degrees <b>Fahrenheit.</b>|$|E
5|$|The region's {{precipitation}} pattern is bimodal, meaning agriculture is sustained through snowfall during winter and autumn and rainfall during spring and summer. The climate is semi-arid. Water for farming and consumption {{was provided by}} summer rains, winter snowfall, and seeps and springs in and near the Mesa Verde villages. At , the middle mesa areas were typically ten degrees <b>Fahrenheit</b> (5.5°C) cooler than the mesa top, which reduced {{the amount of water}} needed for farming. The cliff dwellings were built to take advantage of solar energy. The angle of the sun in winter warmed the masonry of the cliff dwellings, warm breezes blew from the valley, and the air was ten to twenty degrees warmer in the canyon alcoves than {{on the top of the}} mesa. In the summer, with the sun high overhead, much of the village was protected from direct sunlight in the high cliff dwellings.|$|E
25|$|Degrees <b>Fahrenheit</b> {{are used}} in the U.S. to measure {{temperatures}} in most non-scientific contexts. The Rankine scale of absolute temperature also saw some use in thermodynamics. Scientists worldwide use the kelvin and degree Celsius. Several U.S. technical standards are expressed in <b>Fahrenheit</b> temperatures and American medical practitioners often use degrees <b>Fahrenheit</b> for body temperature.|$|E
60|$|Soon {{after this}} sad event the winter began to exhibit unwonted signs of severity. It had begun earlier, and {{continued}} later than usual. The snow averaged three feet {{deep in the}} plains and four feet in the woods, and the cold was intense, being frequently down to forty-five degrees below zero of <b>Fahrenheit's</b> scale, while the ice measured between five and six feet in thickness on the rivers.|$|R
60|$|The cold {{experienced}} by these navigators {{of the northern}} seas is terribly intense. Their thermometers have frequently indicated a temperature as low as 75 degrees below zero, or 107 degrees of frost, on <b>Fahrenheit's</b> scale. The thermometers of arctic explorers are always filled with spirits of wine, as quicksilver freezes at about 40 degrees below zero, and is therefore unsuitable. It would be frozen, indeed, {{the greater part of}} the winter.|$|R
60|$|It is {{well known}} that when fresh water becomes so cold that its {{temperature}} is 32 degrees of <b>Fahrenheit's</b> scale, it loses its liquid form and becomes ice. A somewhat lower temperature than this is necessary to freeze salt water; the reason being, that greater force is required to expel the salt which the sea holds in solution,--which salt is always more or less expelled in the process of freezing.|$|R
25|$|Another {{example was}} the Met Office who, in 1962, started {{publishing}} temperatures in both Celsius and <b>Fahrenheit,</b> dropping {{the use of}} <b>Fahrenheit</b> from their official reports in 1970.|$|E
25|$|As {{a simple}} example, if f {{converts}} a temperature in degrees Celsius C to degrees <b>Fahrenheit</b> F, the function converting degrees <b>Fahrenheit</b> to degrees Celsius {{would be a}} suitable f−1.|$|E
25|$|Rømer {{developed}} one of {{the first}} temperature scales while convalescing from a broken leg. <b>Fahrenheit</b> visited him in 1708 and improved on the Rømer scale, the result being the familiar <b>Fahrenheit</b> temperature scale still in use today in a few countries.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fahrenheit's</b> songs mainly {{fall into}} the bubblegum pop and pop ballad category. However, songs like Teachable Child (孺子可教 Ru Zi Ke Jiao) and Love's Arrived (愛到 Ai Dao) are {{intended}} for a light R approach. Songs similar to The Secret of Immortality (不死之謎 Bu Si Zhi Mi) and Superb (出神入化 Chu Shen Ru Hua) are leaning toward the pop rock and rap genre, where they displayed their ability to rap and harmonize well.|$|R
50|$|When The Authority's Doctor resurrected Winter, his {{teammates}} were resurrected as well, including Fuji. According to <b>Fahrenheit's</b> memories, one of The Monitors seemingly {{played a role}} in this, specifying that they would be needed. Later in the Stormwatch: Post Human Division issue of Wildstorm: Armageddon however, it is suggested that they were saved by a possible future version of Jackson King. Fuji has rejoined the reorganized Stormwatch Prime. Fuji is seen playing a support role in the Post Human Division comic book series.|$|R
6000|$|To {{some people}} the serious {{nature of this}} may not at first be apparent. But they may {{appreciate}} the situation in some degree when I tell them that on that occasion I suddenly found myself about twenty miles from home, fatigued, hungry, with the night descending over the wilderness, the thermometer about thirty-five below zero, of <b>Fahrenheit's</b> scale, with the snow for my bed, and without that all important flint, steel and tinder, wherewith to procure fire for the cooking of my food and the warming of my frame! ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Fahrenheit</b> first gained minor {{recognition}} around late 2005 {{when they}} first acted altogether in the series, KO One, was broadcast on television in Taiwan. Wu Chun joined the group later in late 2005. On December 28, 2005, <b>Fahrenheit</b> officially became a vocal quartet boy band.|$|E
25|$|Two of the {{earliest}} such units of measure to come into use were the horsepower and the degree <b>Fahrenheit.</b> The horsepower was defined by James Watt in 1782 as the power required to raise 33,000 pounds of water through a height of one foot in one minute and the degree <b>Fahrenheit</b> was first defined by Daniel <b>Fahrenheit</b> in about 1713 as being a temperature scale having its lower calibration point (0°F) at temperature where a supersaturated salt/ice mixture froze and its upper calibration point at body temperature (96°F). In 1777 the Royal Society, under the chairmanship of Henry Cavendish, proposed {{the definition of the}} <b>Fahrenheit</b> scale be modified such that the temperature corresponding to the melting point of ice be 32°F and the boiling point of water under standard atmospheric conditions be 212°F.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, the <b>Fahrenheit</b> {{scale is}} widely used. On this scale the {{freezing}} point of water corresponds to 32°F and {{the boiling point}} to 212°F. The Rankine scale, still used in fields of chemical engineering in the U.S., is an absolute scale based on the <b>Fahrenheit</b> increment.|$|E
60|$|The {{period of}} flight was {{an hour and}} three-quarters, which, for those {{early days of the}} art, was a pretty long voyage. By {{throwing}} over ballast the voyagers ascended, and by letting off gas they descended at pleasure; and they observed that during an hour, while they were exposed to the sun's rays, the gas was heated up to the temperature of fifty-five degrees of <b>Fahrenheit's</b> scale, which had the effect of sensibly increasing the buoyancy of the balloon. They descended safely on the meadow of Nesle, about twenty-five miles from Paris.|$|R
25|$|Aaron Yan was {{initially}} contracted {{to star in}} another upcoming drama, Momo Love, alongside his co star of Mysterious Incredible Terminator, Gui Gui. Aaron and Guigui have receive a best on-screen couple award, fans like them together as Guilun. Filming began for the show, but was put on hold due to <b>Fahrenheit's</b> album promotion. The show is scheduled for a 2009 release, but due to Aaron's company only wants him to take part of one drama, his role in Momo Love was given to Jiro Wang and Gui Gui's part was given to actress Cyndi Wang.|$|R
50|$|Joseph Black {{investigated}} {{a special}} case of this phenomenon comparing previously-boiled with unboiled water; the previously-boiled water froze more quickly. Evaporation was controlled for. He discussed the influence of stirring {{on the results of}} the experiment, noting that stirring the unboiled water led to it freezing {{at the same time as}} the previously-boiled water, and also noted that stirring the very-cold unboiled water led to immediate freezing. Joseph Black then discussed <b>Fahrenheit's</b> description of supercooling of water (although the term supercooling had not then been coined), arguing, in modern terms, that the previously-boiled water could not be as readily supercooled.|$|R
