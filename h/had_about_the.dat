5|$|For {{the first}} six episodes, the show had five corners, or parts, which started with opening {{greetings}} from the hosts {{and went on to}} thoughts and impressions that listeners <b>had</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> show. This moved on to an informal talk between the hosts, followed by a section where entries previously submitted by listeners concerning their enthusiasm for Key were read by the hosts. The fourth corner concerned answering questions that had been submitted by listeners, and the final corner had Orito playing the flute; listeners could submit suggestions for songs he was to play. Two more corners were added starting with the seventh broadcast. The first corner added concerns scary stories that the hosts can tell themselves, or read from submissions by listeners, and was added partly because Hinoue enjoys such stories. The second corner added deals with submissions by listeners describing a new fictional character, and Hinoue takes these submissions and forms a new fictional character out of combining elements from multiple submissions together. During the broadcasts, tracks from the soundtracks released under Key Sounds Label play in the background.|$|E
25|$|Only {{a single}} {{prototype}} was built. It was assigned {{the serial number}} B9909, although this is not visible on surviving photographs of the type. Official flight testing started in July 1917 at RAF Martlesham Heath. Performance was excellent – it <b>had</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same speed as the S.E.5a, but climbed rather better. The only complaints about its handling were of poor lateral control (early S.E.5s had similar problems, which were quickly resolved).|$|E
25|$|For small transactions, various {{consumer}} goods (which <b>had</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same standard value among {{the majority of}} the Tibetans) could be used. Among others, these were areca nuts, tobacco, ceremonial scarves (khatas, also named khadags; Tibetan: kha btags) and tea Tea was usually traded in the form of tea bricks (Tibetan: ja sbag). This developed into the most important medium of exchange in the 19th century, when a regular coinage had already been introduced into Tibet.|$|E

25|$|When a {{physician}} friend gave {{this article to}} Ovila Lesperance, a nephew to the Giant, {{it was the first}} indication the family <b>had</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> body’s whereabouts. In 1975 Lesperance found the Giant’s body during a visit to the University of Montreal. Until that time, a cover was draped only around the outside of the glass, allowing visitors to look at Édouard’s body inside. Disgusted by this display Lesperance succeeded in getting officials to partially wrap the cloth around the body of the giant inside the case. University officials agreed to do this but Lesperance and many of Édouard’s other relatives remained unsatisfied, including the Giant’s grandniece, Cecile Gibouleau.|$|E
25|$|West Yorkshire Police were criticised {{for being}} inadequately {{prepared}} {{for an investigation}} on this scale. It {{was one of the}} largest investigations by a British police force and predated the use of computers. Information on suspects was stored on handwritten index cards. Aside from difficulties in storing and accessing the paperwork (the floor of the incident room was reinforced to cope with the weight of the paper), it was difficult for officers to overcome the information overload of such a large manual system. Sutcliffe was interviewed nine times, but all information the police <b>had</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> case was stored in paper form, making cross-referencing difficult, compounded by television appeals for information which generated thousands more documents.|$|E
25|$|Antony Beevor in 1991 and P. D. Antill in 2005, {{wrote that}} Allied commanders {{knew of the}} {{invasion}} through Ultra intercepts. Freyberg had been informed of the air component of the German battle plan and started to prepare a defence near the airfields and along the north coast. He had been hampered {{by a lack of}} modern equipment and the lightly armed paratroopers <b>had</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same firepower as the defenders, if not more. Ultra intelligence was detailed but was taken out of context and misinterpreted. While emphasis was placed on the airborne assault, the German messages also mentioned seaborne operations and Freyberg, expecting an amphibious landing, garrisoned the coast which reduced the number of men available to defend the airfield at Maleme, the principal German objective. In 1993, F. H. Hinsley, the official historian of British intelligence during the war, wrote that the Germans had more casualties in the conquest of Crete than {{in the rest of the}} Greek campaign and that the losses inflicted on the 7th Fliegerdivision were huge. It was the only unit of its kind and was not rebuilt.|$|E

500|$|The romantic {{notions that}} Himmler <b>had</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Bosnian Muslims were {{probably}} {{significant in the}} division's genesis. He was personally fascinated by the Islamic faith and believed that Islam created fearless soldiers. He found their ferocity preferable to the gentility of Christians and believed their martial qualities should be further developed and put to use. He thought that Muslim men would make perfect SS soldiers as Islam [...] "promises them Heaven if they fight and are killed in action." [...] As for their ethnic background and SS requirements, it appears that Himmler accepted the theories advanced by both Croatian and German nationalists that the Croatian people, including the Muslims, were not ethnic Slavs but pure Aryans of either Gothic or Iranian descent.|$|E
500|$|On 6May more {{witnesses}} for {{the prosecution}} were called. [...] As Squires and her family watched, several of Wells's neighbours insisted they <b>had,</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> beginning of 1753, seen the old gypsy in the area. [...] More witnesses claimed to have seen her in various places around Enfield Wash, including one woman who swore she had seen her on Old Christmas Day. [...] Britain's calendar had in September 1752 changed from the old-style Julian calendar, to the Gregorian calendar, and the woman was unable to discern the exact day on which she claimed to have seen Squires. [...] She was not alone; several of the defence's witnesses were also unable to manage the 11-day correction required by the calendar change. [...] Others were illiterate, and struggled similarly. [...] The court also heard from three witnesses present solely to discredit the testimony offered by the Natuses.|$|E
500|$|Ogden Reid died {{early in}} 1947, making Helen Reid {{leader of the}} Tribune in name {{as well as in}} fact. [...] Reid chose her son, Whitelaw Reid, known as [...] "Whitie" [...] as editor. [...] The younger Reid had written for the {{newspaper}} and done creditable work covering the London Blitz, but had not been trained for the duties of his position and was unable to provide forceful leadership for the newspaper. [...] The Tribune also failed {{to keep pace with the}} Times in its facilities: [...] While both papers <b>had</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same level of profits between 1947 and 1950, the Times was heavily reinvesting money in its plant and hiring new employees. [...] The Tribune, meanwhile, with Helen Reid's approval, cut $1 million from its budgets and fired 25 employees on the news side, reducing its foreign and crime coverage. Robinson was dismissive of the circulation lead of the Times, saying in a 1948 memo that 75,000 of its rival's readers were [...] "transients" [...] who only read the wanted ads.|$|E

500|$|Ronald D. Moore {{stated that}} [...] "Downloaded" [...] is his {{favorite}} {{episode of the}} series, and especially admired the acting of Park, Helfer, and Callis, the latter especially for his change in role. Jacob Clifton of Television Without Pity gave the episode an [...] "A+" [...] rating. Keith McDuffee of TV Squad commented that the episode was [...] "perfect", and made up for any issues he <b>had</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> show before the episode. He found the storyline concerning the birth of Hera Agathon, the hybrid baby, a [...] "clever twist", and appreciated the episode's general Cylon perspective. The Chicago Tribune appreciated Park, Helfer, and Lawless' acting {{and the appearance of}} Dr. Cottle, and concluded by saying that it was well-crafted and added to the [...] "deftly drawn moral confusion" [...] over whether the Cylons were good or evil. The episode was nominated by the World Science Fiction Society for the 2007 Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form, an award that was won by the Doctor Who episode [...] "The Girl in the Fireplace".|$|E
500|$|In {{his memoirs}} Hoxha recounts the {{apprehension}} {{he and others}} <b>had</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> post-Stalin leadership, just days after Stalin's death. [...] "The {{way in which the}} death of Stalin was announced and his funeral ceremony was organized created the impression... that many members of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had been awaiting his death impatiently." [...] A meeting with Soviet leaders held in June that year further raised his suspicions about the intentions of the new leadership, as did a reduction in Soviet and Eastern Bloc aid to Albania early in 1954 as Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev [...] "seemed to believe that the high cost of aid to support Albania was not worth the return in terms of Soviet strategic interests in the country." [...] Reacting to early post-Stalin Soviet pressure on the East European countries to pursue economic and political reforms, Albania announced slight changes in planning priorities and some willingness to improve state relations with Yugoslavia as the Soviets were doing. There was also a reshuffling of political portfolios in line with the Soviet re-emphasis on the principle of collective leadership.|$|E
500|$|Reviews written {{during the}} initial arena legs {{reflected}} the dramatic change in U2's approach. Many critics published favourable reviews about the tour. The San Francisco Chronicle praised the special effects for supplementing the music. The reviewer wrote, [...] "The often-surrealistic effects always served the songs, {{not the other way}} around." [...] The review concluded, [...] "this magnificent multimedia production will serve as a pinnacle in rock's onstage history for sometime to come". Edna Gundersen of USA Today said that U2 was dismantling its myth and wrote that the show was [...] "a trippy and decadent concert of bedazzling visuals and adventurous music". Melody Makers Jon Wiederhorn wrote that he expected to dislike the show based upon their past stage history, [...] "But, alas, I cannot be negative about U2 tonight. Their Zoo TV show is visually stunning, musically unparalleled, downright moving and, dammit, truly entertaining." [...] Hot Press Bill Graham said of the show, [...] "U2 don't so much use every trick in the book as invent a whole new style of rock performance art." [...] For Graham, the tour resolved any doubts he <b>had</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> band—particularly about Bono—following their reinvention with Achtung Baby.|$|E

There was also a discussion that the gang <b>had</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> show Wings while swimming in the beer tank.

Brian sets up a cutaway when he says that breaking up with Jillian will be tougher than the reviews for Our American Cousin.

500|$|... "Equus October" [...] {{was born}} out of a song that the band were {{considering}} discarding because they were never able to finish it until they entered the studio and changed their minds, wanting more material on the album. They decided to use a riff from it only as an interlude that ran 30 seconds long, but they came up with more ideas {{about what to do with}} it during the mixing process, eventually increasing the length of the song. Rubalcaba explained that the bass guitar line remained a constant fixture on jam sessions between himself and Eginton, and they decided to give it a chance by recording it at the album's sessions. Once Mitchell also began adding material to the song, Rubalcaba felt it started taking on a [...] "strong & majestic yet mournful" [...] sensation, almost as if it were about a ritualistic sacrifice. He later discovered the ritual of the October Horse and based the song's title on that of the ritual. [...] "It took on the feeling I <b>had</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> jam & how it just completely comes crashing down so abruptly at the end," [...] he explained. Expanding the song in the studio led the group to want to use it as an interlude that leads into the album's title track.|$|E
500|$|In 1976, Ripken {{finally reached}} the major leagues when the Orioles named him their bullpen coach. Halfway through 1977, he became the third base coach for the Orioles when Billy Hunter was hired to be {{the manager of the}} Texas Rangers. Ripken served in this role through the 1986 season. During this time, and even later when he became a manager, he would pitch batting {{practice}} and hit fungoes before games. He {{would be one of the}} last members of the team to leave after games. Ripken could be tough on the players he coached, enjoying using the term [...] "lunkhead" [...] when talking to them, but he would always make time to answer any questions they <b>had</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> game. Doug DeCinces, who played under him through the 1981 season, recalled, [...] "He was the dictator of that regimen, instructing us on everything down to how to wear our socks. He said, `Take pride in your appearance and you'll take pride in your game.'" [...] The Orioles experienced great success during this time, reaching the World Series in 1979, which they lost to the Pittsburgh Pirates in seven games. Four years later, Ripken earned a World Series ring as the Orioles won the 1983 World Series in five games over the Philadelphia Phillies.|$|E

500|$|By {{the fourth}} ballot, on Saturday, June 23, Sherman <b>had</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{same number of}} votes he had started with, but was being {{challenged}} by a surge from former Indiana senator Benjamin Harrison. [...] The convention then adjourned until Monday, June 25. [...] With almost two days for intrigue, rumors swept through the convention that Blaine would be a candidate after all. Late on Saturday night, Foraker released a statement that he would support Blaine. [...] Walters proffered several reasons for the switch: [...] Foraker felt Sherman had no chance, resented not being thanked by Sherman for the seconding speech, and was annoyed at the trickle of votes McKinley had received, feeling that the congressman was being prepared as a backup candidate for the Sherman forces. There was also talk that Foraker might gain {{a place on the}} ticket, either for president or vice president, though he stated he would not accept a nomination without Sherman's consent. [...] The switch wounded Sherman's candidacy by showing that his own state's governor did not support him, and even though Foraker switched back to Sherman when Blaine wired reiterating that he was not a candidate, the damage was done; Harrison gained the nomination on the eighth ballot.|$|E
500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalized}} rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 79, based on 24 professional critic reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews".

[...] Tim Karan of Alternative Press called The Black Parade [...] "MCR's whole raison d'etre rolled up into one mega-decibel calling card". Ed Thompson of IGN stated, [...] "The Black Parade is a rock and roll gem that celebrates everything that was over the top about the 1970s rock scene." [...] David Fricke of Rolling Stone praised the classic rock feel of the album. Entertainment Weekly stated that [...] "On their third studio album, a musical H-bomb of an effort, the Jersey quintet combine the rock-opera pomp of Queen with the darker, dirtier tones of their screamo past: Call it a Bro-hemian Rhapsody. Even without its broad concept — a dying cancer patient seeks revenge and redemption — Parade stands {{as one of the most}} cohesive, engaging rock records of 2006." [...] Robert Christgau gave the album a two-star honorable mention (...) and said, [...] "In prog, a good sense of humor means so much." ...|$|E
