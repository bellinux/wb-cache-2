50|$|Some {{hummingbirds}} {{like the}} sapphire-spangled emerald (Amazilia lactea), <b>glittering-bellied</b> <b>emerald</b> (Chlorostilbon lucidus) and planalto hermit (Phaethornis pretrei) {{have been recorded}} as feeding on and pollinating the flowers; these only take it opportunistically.|$|E
50|$|The <b>glittering-bellied</b> <b>emerald</b> (Chlorostilbon lucidus) is {{a species}} of hummingbird in the Trochilidae family. It has widely been listed by the {{scientific}} name Chlorostilbon aureoventris, but this was shown to be mistaken by J. F. Pacheco and B. M. Whitney in 2006.|$|E
50|$|Mammals {{include the}} {{capybara}} (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), robust capuchin monkeys, titis, lowland paca (Cuniculus paca) and common agoutis, {{and endangered species}} such as jaguar (Panthera onca), solitary tinamou (Tinamus solitarius) and the southern muriqui (Brachyteles arachnoides).Birds species include the <b>glittering-bellied</b> <b>emerald</b> (Chlorostilbon lucidus), red-browed amazon (Amazona rhodocorytha), dusky-legged guan (Penelope obscura), finches and Forbes's blackbird (Anumara forbesi).|$|E
50|$|This is a {{very popular}} {{ornamental}} tree in subtropical and tropical climates, grown for its scented flowers and also used as food item in South Asian cuisine. In the Neotropics, {{it can be used}} to attract hummingbirds—such as sapphire-spangled emerald (Amazilia lactea), <b>glittering-bellied</b> <b>emerald</b> (Chlorostilbon lucidus), or white-throated hummingbird (Leucochloris albicollis)—into gardens and parks. On the other hand, in some areas it has become naturalised and invasive.|$|E
5000|$|... 37 {{species of}} mammals have been identified.Mammals include South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), water opossum (Chironectes minimus), giant {{anteater}} (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), {{greater naked-tailed armadillo}} (Cabassous tatouay), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), jaguar (Panthera onca) and black howler (Alouatta caraya).Birds include black-and-white hawk-eagle (Spizaetus melanoleucus), pheasant cuckoo (Dromococcyx phasianellus), rusty-barred owl (Strix hylophila), <b>glittering-bellied</b> <b>emerald</b> (Chlorostilbon lucidus), thick-billed saltator (Saltator maxillosus) and black-throated grosbeak (Saltator fuliginosus).|$|E
50|$|H. chrysotrichus {{grows to}} {{a height of}} 15 to 25 ft, {{sometimes}} up to 50 ft, with a spread of 25 to 35 ft. It has very showy golden-yellow to red flowers in the spring. These are rich in nectar and thus the tree is a useful honey plant. While it is not especially popular with hummingbirds, some of these - e.g. <b>glittering-bellied</b> <b>emerald</b> (Chlorostilbon lucidus) and white-throated hummingbird (Leucochloris albicollis) - seem to prefer them over the flowers of other Tabebuia species.|$|E
50|$|The food of {{this species}} is nectar, often taken from the flowers of large trees. This hummingbird is also notably insectivorous, often {{hovering}} in open areas to catch flying insects. It appears to be somewhat picky regarding favorite foodplants and often does not visit ornamental plants popular with many other hummingbirds, such as Erythrina speciosa or Stifftia chrysantha; certain ornamental Bignoniaceae like the fountain tree (Spathodea campanulata) seem more to this bird's liking. While feeding, {{it has been observed}} to dominate over a <b>glittering-bellied</b> <b>emerald</b> (Chlorostilbon lucidus) and to be displaced by a gilded hummingbird, both considerably smaller species.|$|E
50|$|Over 100 {{species of}} birds {{can be found in}} Flores. For example, rufous horneros, with their oven-like nests, can be seen sitting atop fence posts. Huge colonies of green parrots' nests hang high in the tall eucalyptus. Southern lapwings, locally known as teros, {{burrowing}} owls, and elegant-crested tinamou nest in open fields while long wing harriers, gray eagles, and hawks soar high above. Some of the largest great kiskadees are extremely common as are the guira, a type of cuckoo. Along quiet country lanes giant wood rails, pink spoonbills and kingfishers can be seen, alongside flocks of ibis and white egrets in the pastures. Red headed cardinals, both orange throated and red necked woodpeckers, and scissor-tailed nightjars {{can be seen in the}} small stands of trees that dot the countryside. Long, split tailed flycatchers zip above the rich grass around twilight. <b>Glittering-bellied</b> <b>emerald</b> hummingbirds drink from the tall purple flowers that carpet the fields from Spring until Fall.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} flower morphology, nectar features, and hummingbird visitation to Palicourea crocea (Rubiaceae), {{a common}} ornithophilous shrub {{found in the}} riparian forest understory in the Upper Paraná River floodplain, Brazil. Flowers are distylous and the style-stamen dimorphism is accompanied by other intermorph dimorphisms in corolla length, anther length, and stigma lobe length and form. We did not observe strict reciprocity in the positioning of stigma and anthers between floral morphs. Flowering occurred during the rainy season, October to December. Nectar standing crop per flowerwas relatively constant throughout the day, which apparently resulted in hummingbirds visiting the plant throughout the day. Energetic content of the nectar in each flower (66. 5 J) and that required daily by hummingbird visitors (up to 30 kJ) would oblige visits to hundreds of flowers each day, and thus movements between plants that should result in pollen flow. Three hummingbird species visited the flowers: the Gilded Sapphire (Hylocharis chrysura), the Black-throated Mango (Anthracothorax nigricollis), and the <b>Glittering-bellied</b> <b>Emerald</b> (Chlorostilbon aureoventris). The frequency of hummingbird visitation, nectar features, and the scarcity of other hummingbird-visited flowers in the study area, indicate that P. crocea is an important nectar resource for short-billed hummingbirds in the study site...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT During flight, {{hummingbirds}} {{achieve the}} maximum aerobic metabolism rates within vertebrates. To meet such demands, these birds {{have to take}} in {{as much energy as}} possible, using strategies such as selecting the best food resources and adopting behaviors that allow the greatest energy gains. We tested whether hummingbirds choose sources that have higher sugar concentrations, and investigated their behaviors near and at food resources. The study was conducted at Atlantic forest remnant in Brazil, between June and December 2012. Four patches were provided with artificial feeders, containing sucrose solutions at concentrations of 5 %, 15 %, 25 % and 35 % weight/volume. Hummingbird behaviors were recorded using the ad libitum method with continuous recording of behaviors. The following species were observed: the Brazilian ruby Clytolaema rubricauda (Boddaert, 1783), Violet-capped woodnymph Thalurania glaucopis (Gmelin, 1788), Scale-throated hermit Phaethornis eurynome (Lesson, 1832), White-throated hummingbird Leucochloris albicollis (Vieillot, 1818), Versicoloured emerald Amazilia versicolor (Vieillot, 1818), <b>Glittering-bellied</b> <b>emerald</b> Chlorostilbon lucidus (Shaw, 1812) and other Phaethornis spp. C. rubricauda, P. eurynome and Phaethornis spp. visited the 35 %-sucrose feeders more often, while the T. glaucopis visited the 25 %-sucrose feeders more often. L. albicollis and A. versicolor visited more often solutions with sugar concentration of 15 %. C. lucidus visited all patches equally. Three behavioral strategies were observed: 1) C. rubricauda and T. glaucopis exhibited interspecific and intraspecific dominance; 2) the remaining species exhibited subordinance to the dominant hummingbirds, and 3) P. eurynome and Phaethornis spp. adopted a hide-and-wait strategy to the dominant hummingbird species. The frequency of aggressive behaviors was correlated with the time the hummingbird spent feeding, and bird size. Our results showed that hummingbirds can adopt different strategies to enhance food acquisition; that more aggressive species feeding more than less aggressive species; and that the birds, especially if they were dominant species, visited high quality food resources more often...|$|E

Investigamos a morfologia floral, as características do néctar e a visita de beija-flores a Palicourea crocea (Rubiaceae), uma espécie ornitófila arbustiva comumente encontrada no sub-bosque da vegetação ripária na planície de inundação do Alto Rio Paraná, Brasil. As flores são distílicas, sendo o dimorfismo estilete-estames acompanhado por outras variações morfológicas no comprimento da corola, altura das anteras, comprimento das anteras e comprimento e forma das papilas estigmáticas. Não foi observada reciprocidade estrita na posição dos estigmas e anteras entre flores longistilas e brevistilas. A floração da espécie ocorreu durante a estação chuvosa, de outubro a dezembro. A disponibilidade de néctar foi relativamente constante ao longo do dia, o que aparentemente possibilitou aos beija-flores visitar a planta o dia todo. O conteúdo energético de néctar por flor (66, 5 J) e a demanda diária de energia dos beija-flores visitantes(superior a 30 kJ) os obrigaria a visitar diariamente centenas de flores da espécie, o que pode aumentar o fluxo de pólen. Três espécies de beija-flores foram observadas: beija-flor-dourado (Hylocharis chrysura), beija-flor-de-colete-preto (Anthracothorax nigricollis) e esmeralda-de-bico-vermelho (Chlorostilbon aureoventris). A freqüência de visita dos beija-flores, as características do néctar e a baixa disponibilidade de outras flores visitadas por beija-flores na área de estudo indicam que P. crocea é uma fonte de néctar importante para beija-flores de bico-curto no local...|$|E
