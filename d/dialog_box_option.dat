40|$|The <b>dialog</b> <b>boxes</b> {{are useful}} in case of {{displaying}} warnings, errors, confirmations etc. in special situations. A typical <b>dialog</b> <b>box</b> is displayed in a small window with some text message {{along with a few}} options for the user to select. However, there are certain difficulties associated in programming and implementing a conventional <b>dialog</b> <b>box,</b> such as, severe programming effort, rigidity of the hard coded message, obscuring screen space and so on. There is a need to overcome these difficulties of the <b>dialog</b> <b>box</b> to make them more efficient and useful. The modality of the <b>dialog</b> <b>boxes</b> also creates some limitations. While modal <b>dialog</b> <b>boxes</b> needs to be closed explicitly by the user, modeless <b>dialog</b> <b>boxes</b> can grow in number and become difficult to control. Thus, an ideal <b>dialog</b> <b>box</b> should be deprived of all the above-mentioned drawbacks. The <b>dialog</b> <b>box</b> should not obscure the screen. The user should be able open multiple <b>dialog</b> <b>boxes</b> but without obscuring the screen. This article analyses 5 interesting inventions on <b>dialog</b> <b>boxes</b> selected from US Patent database. Each invention tries to overcome some limitations of a conventional <b>dialog</b> <b>box</b> and provides some innovative features. Each solution is also analyzed from a TRIZ perspective.

This provides flexibility to select new text and apply other formatting without closing the <b>dialog</b> <b>box,</b> selecting new text and opening a new format <b>dialog</b> <b>box.</b> Almost all other Windows applications require {{the user to}} close the <b>dialog</b> <b>box,</b> select new text, then open a new <b>dialog</b> <b>box</b> for formatting/changes.|$|R

We remedy this by extending a previous design and mimicking <b>dialog</b> <b>boxes</b> to provide good visual feedback while still keeping the advantages of keyboard input. A laboratory study showed the new technique to be competitive with <b>dialog</b> <b>boxes</b> on speed and error rate, but strongly preferred over <b>dialog</b> <b>boxes</b> by experienced command line users. This is a marked improvement over the previous design, which was also preferred by the target user group but did not compete with <b>dialog</b> <b>boxes</b> in terms of performance.

50|$|The {{command line}} {{provides}} an interface between {{programs as well}} as the user. In this sense, a command line is an alternative to a <b>dialog</b> <b>box.</b> Editors and data-bases present a command line, in which alternate command processors might run. On the other hand, one might have options on the command line which opens a <b>dialog</b> <b>box.</b> The latest version of 'Take Command' has this feature. DBase used a <b>dialog</b> <b>box</b> to construct command lines, which could be further edited before use.|$|R
50|$|Though iVolume {{is capable}} of being {{configured}} to operate without oversight, unlicensed iVolume will periodically cease processing and display a <b>dialog</b> <b>box</b> soliciting a registration in return for uninterrupted operation. This can have an adverse effect on processing large libraries of music as the <b>dialog</b> <b>box</b> may not be dismissed until a set time has elapsed, the length of which increases by several seconds each time the <b>dialog</b> <b>box</b> is displayed. Furthermore, the unlicensed version stops functioning after analysing 1000 tracks.|$|R

These core drivers are not usable until device specific information is used to inform the core driver of the actual device settings and capabilities. To accomplish this task, a universal printing <b>dialog</b> <b>box</b> is inserted before the standard print setup <b>dialog</b> <b>box.</b> The universal printing <b>dialog</b> <b>box</b> allows users to choose a recently used device, enter a device IP address, search for local print devices, or choose a device from a predefined list.|$|R

In the exploratory phase, we observed how 111 children interacted with <b>dialog</b> <b>boxes</b> of a painting program. We identified the challenges of causality, purpose, hindrance, communication, consequence, and patience faced by the children. Design solutions for addressing these challenges were then developed and prototyped in the design phase. In the evaluation phase, we observed 84 children to interact with the prototypes. We gained {{a better understanding of how}} the design solutions impacted children’s interaction. The study also contributes preliminary implications to guide the design of <b>dialog</b> <b>boxes</b> for children. Author Keywords Child computer interaction, <b>dialog</b> <b>box,</b> design...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{empirical}} analysis of crossing-based <b>dialog</b> <b>boxes.</b> First, we study the spatial constraints required for efficient crossing-based interactions {{in the case}} of a simple multi-parameter <b>dialog</b> <b>box.</b> Through a series of 3 tasks, we establish the minimal value of the landing margin, the takeoff margin, and the column width. We also offer an estimation of the role of stroke shape on user performance. After studying the reasons for errors during our experiment, we propose a relaxed crossing semantic that combines aspects of pointing and crossing-based interfaces. To test our design, we compare a naïve <b>dialog</b> <b>box</b> implementation with our new implementation, as well as a standard point-and-click <b>dialog</b> <b>box.</b> Our results reveal that there is not a significant difference between the naïve crossing implementation and the standard point-and-click interface and that the new crossing semantic is faster than both the naïve crossing implementation and the point-andclick interface, despite a higher error rate. Together these two experiments establish that crossingbased <b>dialog</b> <b>boxes</b> can be as spatially efficient and faster than their point-and-click counterpart. Our new semantic provides the first step towards a smooth transition from point-and-click interfaces to crossing-based interfaces...|$|R
