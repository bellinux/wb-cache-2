5|$|As a hermit, Withers {{lives in}} solitude. He does not own {{a car or}} television; he gets his news from {{the people around him}} and gets around on a bicycle that he found, broken, {{on the side of the}} road. Though he has an open-door policy for people that come to visit him, he himself visits family only twice a year. He does <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer,</b> which he uses to keep in touch with other hermits via email. To earn his food and {{clothing}} allowance, which amounts to less than $5,500 per year, Withers makes pottery to sell and works one day a week for a scientific-instrument company. At the end of each year, he donates any funds that remain to charity.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the millennium, the Internet {{opened up}} the Chinese {{animation}} industry a great deal.

More expensive animation products from Autodesk, Newtek and Adobe were on the horizon for animation schools to adopt.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Ford {{represented}} then-model Martha Stewart, who like Eileen, went to Barnard College. Stewart modeled briefly {{in her late}} teens and early 20s, including for Chanel. In the 1970s, Stewart catered parties and weddings with Dorian Leigh, who became a cordon bleu level chef after retiring from the fashion industry. On the twentieth anniversary of the Ford Agency in 1966, Jerry Ford told The New York Times that they were billing $100,000 per week {{and that they were}} the first modeling agency to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> system.

25|$|The control yokes also {{vary greatly}} amongst aircraft. There are yokes where roll is {{controlled}} by rotating the yoke clockwise/counterclockwise (like steering a car) and pitch {{is controlled by}} tilting the control column towards you or away from you, but in others the pitch is controlled by sliding the yoke {{into and out of}} the instrument panel (like most Cessnas, such as the 152 and 172), and in some the roll is controlled by sliding the whole yoke to the left and right (like the Cessna 162). Centre sticks also vary between aircraft. Some are directly connected to the control surfaces using cables, others (fly-by-wire airplanes) <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> in between which then controls the electrical actuators.|$|E
25|$|Some modern amateur {{transceivers}} have embedded {{computers with}} firmware which is executed {{to provide the}} functions and features of the transceiver. This software must be provided by the original manufacturer of the equipment. Another type of software is that required to control a receiver (or transceiver) without a front panel provided. Examples of this are the Kenwood TS-B2000 and the Ten-Tec Pegasus; both transceivers are sold with PC software to provide the human interface for operation. Most transceivers with front control panels (and many receivers popular among shortwave listeners) <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> interface such as a serial port, USB or Ethernet port. These ports are useful for satellite-tracking frequency control (Doppler tuning), station logging, digital operation, internet and special-needs accessibility. In many cases, the software adds improved or extra functions and features beyond that provided by the original design. For this reason, some operators purchase radio-control software for non-computerized operation even if their radio has a front control panel.|$|E

He also pointed out that William Gibson was computer illiterate when he wrote Neuromancer.

500|$|Hans-Joachim Bremermann, a {{professor}} of mathematics and biophysics at the University of California at Berkeley, further argued in a 1965 paper that the [...] "speed, memory, and processing capacity of any possible future computer equipment are limited by certain physical barriers: the light barrier, the quantum barrier, and the thermodynamical barrier. These limitations imply, for example, that no computer, however constructed, {{will ever be able}} to examine the entire tree of possible move sequences of the game of chess." [...] Nonetheless, Bremermann did not foreclose the possibility that a computer would someday be able to solve chess. He wrote, [...] "In order to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> play a perfect or nearly perfect game [...] it will be necessary either to analyze the game completely ... or to analyze the game in an approximate way and combine this with a limited amount of tree searching. ... A theoretical understanding of such heuristic programming, however, is still very much wanting." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the San Diego Union {{at the start of the}} 1986 season, Boros assured Padres fans that he would not make extensive use of the computer as he had in Oakland. The resulting article noted:"At Oakland, Boros used computers extensively, studying percentages and tendencies to guide his strategic decisions, but at heart, he is a humanist. He would rather read a good baseball novel than a complex statistical analysis of the game. 'I found that players are very suspicious of computers, much like the general public,' he said. 'They fear them as cold and impersonal and inhuman. I couldn't make them understand that I was still going to make my own decisions, I wasn't going to let the computer make them for me. I'm going to use some data and stats here, but we won't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> and a programmer in the clubhouse like we did in Oakland." ...|$|E

2500|$|Brøderbund Software’s {{marketing}} strategy {{aimed at a}} target demographic: [...] "young parents who <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> at home and want their kids to learn while playing". To do this, it created edutainment titles with [...] "entertaining graphics and sound", beta-tested them with kids to ensure they were easy to use, and had deals with retailers like Best Buy and Babbages. An MHHE document entitled Marketing’s Role within the Firm or Nonprofit Organization explained [...] "retailers are happy to give new Brøderbund products shelf space {{because they know that}} Brøderbund’s promotion will help bring customers into the store". In the case of Great Chase Through Time, Brøderbund [...] "not only placed ads in family-oriented computer magazines but also sent direct-mail flyers to its registered customers". Due to brand loyalty, Carmen Sandiego games were able to be sold for more money than software from other companies. Parents appreciated that it [...] "caters to their needs and offers good customer value". The Mirror held a promotion where they would give away 10 copies of the video game through The A List. The game was included in the TLC School Alliance, which saw its titles being sold at discount at theNSBA Conference in Nashville and the California CUE Conference in Santa Clara. James Lyband Jackson, Computer Education Coordinator for both the YWCA/Day Care and the Church, included the [...] " [...] hands-on history" [...] program as part of their education program. The School Edition of the game came with a three-ring binder to hold the software, a User's Guide, a custom-developed Teacher's Guide, and the resource book World History Simulations by Max W.
