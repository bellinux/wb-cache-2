25|$|Still {{secured to}} the buoy off Sheerness Dockyard, she {{received}} 90lb of fresh vegetables and 182lb fresh beef on 10 June. On 11 June, she was inspected by the Commander-in-Chief. Repairs {{in the engine}} room appeared to be complete by early afternoon, and fires were lighted in four boilers between 14:30 and 15:30; the ship prepared for sea, however soon after 18:00 a defect {{was found in the}} after centrifugal <b>fan</b> <b>spindle</b> in the engine room, so fires were banked. Artificers worked all night to repair the defect. Repairs in the engine room were completed by 17:00 on 12 June. Fires were brought forward in the boilers, and at 19:00, the ship slipped and proceeded out under steam. She proceeded to Portsmouth; travelling 154 nautical miles under steam burning 35 tons 18 cwt (36.5 t) coal for the engines and 6 cwt for the ship. At Portsmouth she saluted the admiral superintendent with 11 guns at 14:35. On 15 June she stowed Whitehead torpedoes. Some torpedoes were fired to test them.|$|E
50|$|The 4-cylinder engine had a {{slightly}} larger cylinder bore than the superseded 25-30, giving an RAC rating of 36.3 hp from 5842 cc (32.8 hp, 5278 cc). It took 25-30's {{place in the}} catalogue. The engine's crankshaft runs in no fewer than five bearings. Power was transmitted to the live rear axle through a multiple-disc clutch with phosphor bronze and steel friction surfaces and a gearbox with sliding spur-wheel gears, providing four forward speeds and reverse, using a shaft fitted with two universal joints. The gearbox, of unusually strong design including an extra bearing on the inner end of the engine driven shaft, is operated on the gate principle. Unusually by 1907 the engine was fitted with a governor mounted on the <b>fan</b> <b>spindle</b> operating on the car's throttle. The Krebs carburettor initially fitted was replaced by an Austin design. Cooling water was circulated by a centrifugal pump, oil by a skew-gear driven vane-pump. An oil pressure gauge is fitted.|$|E

50|$|Brushless motors are {{commonly}} used as pump, <b>fan</b> and <b>spindle</b> drives in adjustable or variable speed applications as {{they are capable of}} developing high torque with good speed response. In addition, they can be easily automated for remote control. Due to their construction, they have good thermal characteristics and high energy efficiency. To obtain a variable speed response, brushless motors operate in an electromechanical system that includes an electronic motor controller and a rotor position feedback sensor.|$|R
5000|$|Kearfott-Bane House is a {{historic}} home located near Baker Heights, Berkeley County, West Virginia. The [...] "T" [...] shaped house was built in 1901 in the Queen Anne style. It features fanciful porches, hipped and gable roofs, and generous use of decorative <b>spindles,</b> <b>fans,</b> and other motifs.|$|R
