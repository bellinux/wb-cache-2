5|$|Millhouse, now the State Parliamentary Leader of the LM, {{announced}} the LM's {{policy for the}} 1975 state election at the Adelaide Town Hall on 2 July. He outlined the LM's plans for economic rejuvenation: an end to compulsory unionism, budget and tax cuts, and measures to curb rising inflation and cost of living. Social policy included proposals for an early form of multiculturalism and promotion of 'cultural diversity' and bilingualism. Energy policy appealed {{to a new generation}} of <b>environmentalists,</b> <b>and</b> promoted conservation and promotion of solar power. He slammed the proposed City of Monarto as a 'monument to socialist folly'.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{unsuccessful}} attempt {{to save the}} Star Ferry pier in early 2007, a campaign to preserve the pier in situ was launched. Ahead of the closure, members of the public, <b>environmentalists,</b> <b>and</b> some lawmakers arrived to tie blue ribbons to indicate their desire to preserve the harbour. On 22 April, about 100 protesters once again rallied at the pier, launching farewell voyages in a last-ditch attempt to urge the Government to reconsider: a petition of over 400 signatures from the Arts community was collected.|$|E
5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{debate about whether}} the Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate is correct, and of {{the relevance of the}} Jevons paradox to energy conservation policy. Most governments, <b>environmentalists</b> <b>and</b> NGOs pursue policies that improve efficiency, holding that it will lower resource consumption and reduce environmental problems. Others, including many environmental economists, doubt this 'efficiency strategy' towards sustainability, and worry that efficiency gains may in fact lead to higher production and consumption. They hold that for resource use to fall, efficiency gains should be coupled with other policies that limit resource use.|$|E

5|$|Today {{they live}} in many places, {{including}} some National Parks. Occasionally they are mustered and domesticated for use as campdrafters, working stock horses on farms or stations, but also as trail horses, show horses, Pony Club mounts and pleasure horses. They {{are the subject of}} some controversy – regarded as a pest and threat to native ecosystems by <b>environmentalists</b> <b>and</b> the government, but also valued by others as part of Australia's heritage, with supporters working to prevent inhumane treatment or extermination, and rehoming Brumbies who have been captured.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{of a new}} four-lane {{bridge across}} the Raritan River (now the John A. Lynch Memorial Bridge) began in the 1960s, but in 1970, when the {{environment}} impact laws came out, construction froze with only three massive piers standing out of the river. Outside of the bridge, there was significant controversy over the abandoned Delaware and Raritan Canal heading through New Brunswick. The new freeway was to supplant the former canal and its thirteenth lock in New Brunswick, abandoned in 1932. The <b>environmentalists</b> <b>and</b> the historic preservationists opposed the freeway extension because of the fears of losing the canal, while companies like Johnson & Johnson supported the new highway for redeveloping New Brunswick.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of Mora's death, the {{organization}} he worked with cancelled beach patrol efforts in Costa Rica. His death attracted international attention, including {{a statement from the}} United Nations and multiple rewards for information on the case. In Costa Rica, his death led to calls for reform of environmental policy. On June 4, the government met with environmentalists to discuss potential changes to policy. A plan submitted by <b>environmentalists</b> <b>and</b> endorsed by Environment Minister René Castro would set up a new protected area and grant park rangers more authority to stop poachers, among other changes. On June 5, vigils were held across Costa Rica in honor of Mora. On June 18, the government announced the allocation of ₡20 million (US$40,000), which was later upped to ₡30 million (US$60,000), to memorialize Mora.|$|E

5|$|Today, the Klamath is {{a popular}} {{recreational}} river {{as well as an}} important source of water for agriculture. It includes many of the longest free-flowing stretches of river in California, including excellent stretches of whitewater. However, dams and diversions in the upper basin have often caused water quality issues in {{the lower half of the}} river. Environmental groups and native tribes have proposed broad changes to water use in the Klamath Basin, including the removal of some dams on the river to expand fish habitat. They put forth their concerns in what is now the Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement, a water management plan signed by local communities, governments, tribal groups, <b>environmentalists,</b> <b>and</b> fishermen. The proposal has been endorsed by the U.S. Department of the Interior but has not been authorized by the United States Congress.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year, Gate Petroleum leased {{a portion}} of their Blount Island property to the United States Marine Corps. In 1989, the U.S. Navy signed a $5 million per year contract with Gate to dock two ships at Blount Island on new piers built for that purpose. The construction, which would require dredging the channel, was opposed by a group of fishermen, <b>environmentalists</b> <b>and</b> nearby residents who owned riverfront property.|$|E

However, plans are in progress to complete the motorway, which caused a heavy debate between the <b>environmentalists</b> <b>and</b> the local businessmen.|$|E
