25|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that religiosity {{can be a}} pathway to both mental <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> disorder. For example, religiosity is positively associated with mental disorders that involve an excessive amount of self-control and negatively associated with mental disorders that involve a lack of self-control. Other studies have found indications of mental health among both the religious and the secular. For instance, Vilchinsky & Kravetz found negative correlations with psychological distress among religious and secular subgroups of Jewish students. In addition, intrinsic religiosity has been inversely related to depression in the elderly, while extrinsic religiosity has no relation or even a slight positive relation to depression. Religiosity {{has been found to}} mitigate the negative impact of injustice and income inequality on life satisfaction.|$|E

Amid great {{interest}} from the public, England won the series in the final match. Hutton then led England in a controversial tour of the West Indies, where local politics and the behaviour of players led to difficulties. Although the series was drawn and Hutton had great personal success, he faced criticism for the behaviour of his team. When he withdrew from cricket {{for a time in}} 1954, he was replaced as captain and influential members of the cricket establishment wanted to replace him as captain for the forthcoming tour of Australia. However, he retained the position and led England to a 31 victory that winter, after which he retired owing to ill <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> exhaustion.|$|E
25|$|The World Trade Center Health Registry was {{established}} in 2002 by ATSDR and the New York City Department of <b>Health</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mental</b> Hygiene to track the long-term {{physical and mental health}} effects of the September 11 attacks. The registry contains more than 71,000 people who lived, worked, or went to school near the World Trade Center site, as well as emergency response personnel who were involved in rescue and recovery efforts. It is the largest post-disaster health registry in the United States. Researchers use the registry to study the health effects of the disaster and to develop public health recommendations for future disasters. A 2009 study based on registry data found that posttraumatic stress disorder and asthma were the two most commonly reported conditions among registry participants 5 to 6 years after the disaster. The study found that 19% of adult participants reported new posttraumatic stress symptoms, and 10% of adult participants reported developing new asthma.|$|E
25|$|Brownsville {{suffers from}} major health disparities in {{comparison}} to the rest of New York City. In 2006, Brownsville had the highest infant mortality rate in New York City (12.5 per 1,000 births), twice the overall city rate (5.9 per 1,000 births). Preterm and teenage births were also more common in Brownsville than in other places citywide. In Brownsville, there were 13.8 preterm births per 1,000 live births (compared to 9.0 per 1,000 citywide), and 38.5 teenage births per 1,000 live births (compared to 23.6 per 1,000 citywide), giving the area the second-highest teenage birth rate of any neighborhood in the city. In 2015, Brownsville had the lowest average life span (74.1 years) of any New York City neighborhood. A New York City Department of <b>Health</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mental</b> Hygiene community health profile the next year found that in Brownsville, the average life expectancy is more than ten years shorter than in Manhattan's Financial District. Brownsville has a high population of residents who are uninsured, or who receive healthcare through Medicaid. In 2015, this population of uninsured residents was estimated to be 18%, which is lower than the citywide rate of 20%, and is expected to decrease in coming years because of the enactment of the Affordable Care Act.|$|E

25|$|The Operations Section is {{composed}} of the five county field offices and certain units working citywide. Within the county field offices, deputy sheriffs assigned to civil law enforcement duties are referenced as Law Enforcement Bureau (LEB) personnel. LEB deputies perform {{a wide array of}} tasks such as evictions, warrants of arrest, orders to commit, and the seizure and sale of property pursuant to judicial mandates. Businesses and individuals that owe the city money pursuant to unpaid city tax warrants, environmental control board summons, and fire and health code violation fines, are targeted for enforcement action. LEB deputies also serve a wide variety of legal process, with orders of protection considered a priority. Each county field office is complemented by civilian support staff to assist in daily administrative functions and customer service. These field offices are accessible to the public, giving citizens of the county/borough a local place to file court process in need of enforcement. Deputies of the Operations Section may be assigned to duties separate from the LEB, either within a county field office or citywide. These duties include arrests and apprehensions on behalf of other city agencies such as the Human Resources Administration, the Department of <b>Health</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mental</b> Hygiene, and the Administration for Children's Services. Deputies may be assigned to scofflaw enforcement or security duties at the city treasury. The Operations Section will also provide deputies for any other assignment as deemed necessary by the agency.|$|E
