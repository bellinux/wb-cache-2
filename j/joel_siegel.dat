500|$|Michael Medved gave Little Miss Sunshine {{four stars}} (out of four) saying that [...] "...this startling and irresistible dark comedy counts {{as one of}} the very best films of the year..." [...] and that {{directors}} Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, the movie itself, and actors Alan Arkin, Abigail Breslin, and Steve Carell deserved Oscar nominations. <b>Joel</b> <b>Siegel</b> issued a rarely awarded 'A' rating, saying that [...] "Orson Welles would have to come back to life for this not to make my year-end Top10 list." [...] Stella Papamichael of BBC News called the film [...] "a winning blend of sophistication and silliness". USA Todays Claudia Puig commented on Breslin's depiction of Olive Hoover, [...] "If Olive had been played by any other little girl, she would not have affected us as mightily as it did." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Joel</b> <b>Siegel</b> of ABC News {{called the}} film {{technically}} [...] "well-made," [...] but criticized {{its attempt to}} describe a supposedly scientific basis for time travel as both silly and dull, as did Manohla Dargis of The New York Times, who additionally found the depiction of parishes decimated by Hurricane Katrina [...] "vulgar". Todd Gilchrist from IGN rated the film eight out of ten, calling it a [...] "bravura set piece", despite an ending that [...] "feels inappropriate given the urgency (and seeming inevitability) of the story's dénouement." [...] Likewise, Michael Wilmington of the Orlando Sentinel rated the film {{three out of four}} stars, citing the [...] "good cast, Tony Scott's swift direction, and unyielding professionalism" [...] as rationale for his rating. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times described the film's exploration of the nature of time and the implications of time travel as having been a [...] "sci-fi staple for generations".|$|E
500|$|Stossel {{intended}} to go work at Seattle Magazine, {{but it had}} gone out of business by the time he graduated. His contacts there, however, got him a job at KGW-TV in Portland, Oregon, where Stossel began as a newsroom gofer, working his way up to researcher and then writer. After a few years, the news director told Stossel to go on the air and read what he wrote. Stossel, who confesses to having been frightened of being on the air, has expressed embarrassment at watching videos of his early performances. Nonetheless, Stossel says his fear spurred him to improve, examining broadcasts of David Brinkley and Jack Perkins to imitate them. Stossel also struggled with a stuttering problem he had harbored since childhood. After a few years of on-air reporting, Stossel was hired by WCBS-TV in New York City, by Ed Joyce, the same news director who hired Arnold Diaz, Linda Ellerbee, Dave Marash, <b>Joel</b> <b>Siegel</b> and Lynn Sherr. Stossel was disappointed at CBS, feeling that the journalism was of a lower quality than in Portland, and disliking the lesser quantity of time devoted to research there. Stossel cites union work rules that discouraged the extra work that Stossel felt allowed employees to be creative, which he says represented his [...] "first real introduction to the deals made by special interests". Stossel also [...] "hated" [...] Joyce, who he felt was [...] "cold and critical", though Stossel credits Joyce with allowing him the freedom to pursue his own story ideas, and with recommending the Hollins Communications Research Institute in Roanoke, Virginia, that largely cured Stossel's stuttering problem.|$|E

When Siegel's producer moved, he offered Siegel a featured on-air position, and <b>Joel</b> accepted. <b>Siegel</b> proposed to Eyewitness News management that he become a film and theatre critic. He suggested that he would innovate the form by using brief clips from the movie or show being reviewed as drop-ins into his reviews, working them into his scripts as gags to create a new, witty form of review. Siegel, during his years at WCBS-TV, also created features for WCBS-AM Newsradio 88 called <b>Joel</b> <b>Siegel's</b> New York.|$|R

2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave {{three and}} a half stars out of four saying, [...] ""Return of the King" [...] is such a {{crowning}} achievement, such a visionary use of all the tools of special effects, such a pure spectacle, that it can be enjoyed even by those who have not seen the first two films." [...] Richard Corliss of Time named it the best film of the year. The main criticism of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King was its running time, particularly the epilogue; even rave reviews for the film commented on its length. <b>Joel</b> <b>Siegel</b> of Good Morning America said in his review for the film (which he gave an 'A'): [...] "If it didn't take forty-five minutes to end, it'd be my best picture of the year. As it is, it's just one of the great achievements in film history." [...] There was also criticism regarding the Army of the Dead's appearance, rapidly ending the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.|$|E
