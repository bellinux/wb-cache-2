5|$|Hengistbury Head forms {{part of the}} Christchurch Harbour Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), and in May 1990 was {{declared}} a Local Nature Reserve. The head supports 500 plant species (a quarter of the national flora), including eight red data book species, 14 nationally scarce, and 39 locally rare species. The main nature reserve area faces Christchurch Harbour, and is contiguous with the reed beds of Wick Fields. The Head contains a large variety of habitats from the heathland on Warren Hill to freshwater ponds, sand dunes, and salt marshes. The woodland (known as Withybed Wood) is home to English oak and silver birch amongst many other trees, and <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> <b>interest,</b> {{as it is the}} only such area to be shown on an 1811 Ordnance Survey map of the Bournemouth/Christchurch area. In 2002, cattle-grazing commenced in a field near the new visitor centre known as Barn Field. This, combined with gorse eradication, has assisted in the restoration of this habitat to its ancient character.|$|E

5|$|The {{landscape}} of all dance {{in a large}} country such as Brazil is rich and complex due to the mixing of three separate traditions—Indian native, Black African, and Portuguese. In Brazil, the African influence on Brazilian folkdances is considerable. For example, capoeiraa dance-like fighting styleand the maculelê fighting dance are strongly reminiscent of African dances. Capoeira <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> <b>interest.</b> In the 19th century, Capoeira was played mostly by African slaves who had been brought from West Central Africa, making them the original capoeristas and making the art a complex form of social interaction, expressing the participants' physical skills and spiritual essence, involving the gods and {{the spirits of the}} ancestral fathers. The participants played during festivals and holidays, jumping and leaping in front of musical bands, military troops, and religious processions. This dance “game” was considered dangerous to public order and was eventually criminalized in the late 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The most {{abundant}} iron isotope 56Fe <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> <b>interest</b> to nuclear scientists because {{it represents the}} most common endpoint of nucleosynthesis. Since 56Ni (14 alpha particles) is easily produced from lighter nuclei in the alpha process in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see silicon burning process), it is the endpoint of fusion chains inside extremely massive stars, since addition of another alpha particle, resulting in 60Zn, requires {{a great deal more}} energy. This 56Ni, which has a half-life of about 6days, is created in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the supernova remnant gas cloud, first to radioactive 56Co, and then to stable 56Fe. As such, iron is the {{most abundant}} element in the core of red giants, and is the most abundant metal in iron meteorites and in the dense metal cores of planets such as Earth. It is also very common in the universe, relative to other stable metals of approximately the same atomic weight. Iron is the sixth most abundant element in the Universe, and the most common refractory element.|$|E

25|$|Ascus {{evolution}} in Menegazzia <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> <b>interest,</b> because many species have 2-spores per ascus, while all nearly other genera in the Parmeliaceae have 8-spores (making the character likely plesiomorphic for the family).|$|E

25|$|The {{domestication}} {{of maize}} <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> <b>interest</b> to researchers—archaeologists, geneticists, ethnobotanists, geographers, etc. The process is thought {{by some to}} have started 7,500 to 12,000 years ago. Research from the 1950s to 1970s originally focused on the hypothesis that maize domestication occurred in the highlands between the states of Oaxaca and Jalisco, because the oldest archaeological remains of maize known {{at the time were}} found there.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{findings}} suggest mussels grown adjacent to salmon farms are advantageous for winter harvest because they maintain high meat weight and condition index (meat to shell ratio). This finding <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> <b>interest</b> because the Bay of Fundy, where {{this research was}} conducted, produces low condition index mussels during winter months in monoculture situations, and seasonal presence of Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) typically restricts mussel harvest to the winter months.|$|E
25|$|Planktivores {{selectively}} prey upon individual zooplankton, such as copepods, mysids and gammarids. This {{group includes}} most fish larvae, delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) and longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys), tule perch (Hysterocarpus traski), and salmon smolts. The delta smelt <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> <b>interest</b> {{due to its}} endangered status. It may be food-limited, but the evidence is somewhat contradictory. Other factors, such as entrainment of eggs and larvae in the export pumping of fresh water from the Delta may also explain the decline.|$|E
25|$|Where {{the flow}} over the suction {{side of a}} {{transonic}} wing is accelerated to a supersonic speed, the resulting re-compression can be by either Prandtl-Meyer compression or by {{the formation of a}} normal shock. This shock <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> <b>interest</b> to makers of transonic devices because it can cause separation of the boundary layer at the point where it touches the transonic profile. This can then lead to full separation and stall on the profile, higher drag, or shock-buffet, a condition where the separation and the shock interact in a resonance condition, causing resonating loads on the underlying structure.|$|E
