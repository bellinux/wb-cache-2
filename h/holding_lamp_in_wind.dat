60|$|A {{gust of wind}} came {{suddenly}} roaring {{through the}} wood, drowning even the muffled thunder of the sea below. The rain beat upon the window panes. The little house, strongly built though it was, seemed to quiver from its very foundations. I caught up my overcoat, and boldly descended the narrow staircase. Grooton stood at the bottom, <b>holding</b> a <b>lamp</b> <b>in</b> his hand.|$|R
50|$|The {{painting}} {{is listed in}} 1688 inventories of the Sacchetti collections; but not attributed to Preti until 1725. It was painted to hang alongside a painting by the same artist depicting two other Greek philosophers, Heraclitus and Democritus, now found in the Pinacoteca Vaticana. The scholarly Plato is depicted dressed in a fine fur coat against a wall, displaying one of his texts, while Diogenes, in a drap cloak, <b>holds</b> a <b>lamp</b> <b>in</b> the darkness, and points to Plato.|$|R
50|$|Erecting a deepastambha {{in front}} of a temple is still a general {{practice}} in western and southern India. In some of the South Indian temples, raised lamp towers called Kamba Vilakku made of brass can be seen. For adapting the design to households and smaller spaces, the deepavriksha (tree of light) was formed. As the name suggests, it is a metal lamp container with aesthetically curvi-linear lines branching out from the base each <b>holding</b> a <b>lamp.</b> The Deepalakshmi is another favorite design where goddess Lakshmi <b>holds</b> the <b>lamp</b> <b>in</b> her hands. Kuthuvilakku is another typical lamp traditionally used for household purposes in South India.|$|R
50|$|As he grew up, {{he became}} fascinated with flight, first with kites, then later the Wright brothers' airplane. In 1909 {{he decided to}} build one himself based on the Curtiss June Bug, but it was {{destroyed}} on the first test flight. For his next effort, Martin used silk and bamboo in the aircraft's construction. This airplane made a short flight. Martin was often assisted by his mother Minta Martin <b>holding</b> a <b>lamp</b> <b>in</b> the building of his first few airplanes.|$|R
50|$|The {{painting}} {{shows an}} Indian woman <b>holding</b> a lighted <b>lamp</b> <b>in</b> one hand, {{the other hand}} covering {{the light of the}} lamp from the front. The woman is in a simple and traditional Indian saree. The effect of the painting is heightened by the shadow of the woman in the back.|$|R
50|$|Game was {{recorded}} and mixed by Nakata in Shibuya, Tokyo. Four different formats were released {{to promote the}} album; a standalone CD, a limited CD and DVD bundle, and a digital release. It was re-released in February 2016 as a 12-inch LP, featured in both Perfume's 2016 box set Perfume Complete LP Box and a limited singular release. Two different artworks were issued for the album's cover sleeve; one has Perfume inside a small room with synthetic grass, while the second has Perfume <b>holding</b> LED <b>lamps</b> <b>in</b> a dark room.|$|R
60|$|He {{led the way}} to {{the little}} room adjoining, the one Inez had occupied. In one corner of the floor was a square hole, with steps leading down to a sort of blind pocket. <b>Holding</b> a <b>lamp</b> <b>in</b> one hand Miguel descended the steps and pushed against a block of adobe that formed part of the outer wall. It swung inward, {{disclosing}} a cavity about four feet in width and fully six feet high. The interior could be plainly seen from the room, by stooping close to the floor. There were shelves in the cavity and upon one of them stood a jar of milk.|$|R
5000|$|The {{light was}} {{upgraded}} in 1910, with a fourth-order Fresnel lens. It was then modified to lighting by a kerosene <b>lamp.</b> <b>In</b> addition to <b>winding</b> the clockwork mechanism, the keeper {{was required to}} carry the fuel up the 69 steps in buckets, twice daily. In 1922, the light was converted to electricity, making the keeper's job less strenuous.|$|R
50|$|Aarti is a {{symbolic}} expression of complete dedication and devotion by surrendering ourselves to God. Aarti {{is a form}} of prayer where one <b>holds</b> the lighted <b>lamp</b> <b>in</b> their hand and prays to God with complete concentration. In an Aarti, a person’s body, mind and soul are entirely immersed in prayer. All senses of a person including eyes, ears and hands are so involved in this prayer that it is the deepest form of concentrated prayer.|$|R
50|$|The aarti {{plate is}} {{generally}} made of metal, usually silver, bronze or copper. On it must repose a lamp made of kneaded flour, mud or metal, filled with oil or ghee. One or more cotton wicks (always an odd number) {{are put into}} the oil and then lighted, or camphor is burnt instead. The plate may also contain flowers, incense and akshata (rice). In some temples, a plate is not used and the priest <b>holds</b> the ghee <b>lamp</b> <b>in</b> his hand when offering it to the Deities.|$|R
5000|$|On 21 August, {{a letter}} to the editor was {{published}} in Le Monde: Mr Garçon, a Parisian lawyer, condemned Superintendent Sébeille's [...] "ill-considered gossip" [...] to journalists and accused him of trying to cheaply achieve fame. On the same day, Joseph Juliany, a coach driver, reported to the police in Manosque that he had passed the crime scene at 11.30 pm on 4 August on a return journey from Corps (130 km (80 miles) north in the Isère département) to Manosque, and he saw a fairly tall man leaning over the Drummond car's open bonnet, <b>holding</b> a <b>lamp</b> <b>in</b> his hand. By now, thanks to the numerous independent reports of a man looking under the bonnet of the Drummonds' car, the investigators confirmed that the Drummonds had experienced a mechanical problem with their car.|$|R
50|$|Flounder or {{flatfish}} live {{in coastal}} saltwater areas, and {{lie at the}} bottom of the shallow waters waiting for shrimp or minnows to swim nearby. Flounder gigging can be done in daylight, but is often more successful done at night using powerful lights. This method targets nocturnally foraging fish. The light is used to spot the normally camouflaged fish. Historically hollow bamboo poles filled with coal were used for lighting, and more recently kerosene lamps. Modern lights usually use halogen or LED lamps. This method is effective in shallow, clear water where fish are easily observable from the top. The temporarily blind fish are speared with the gig, or sometimes can be collected by hand. During fishing events, an experienced person <b>holds</b> a <b>lamp</b> <b>in</b> the hand and points out fish for other people to collect.|$|R
50|$|Still on 20 August, a Giovani Colussel {{reported}} to the police in La Saulce, 70 km (45 miles) north of the crime scene, that he had passed the location at 5 am {{on the morning after}} the murders, and he saw a sheet that had been laid out flat about 1.5 metres in front of the Drummonds' car. Also on 20 August, Germain Garcin, a lorry driver from Laragne (85 km (50 miles) east of the crime scene), who coincidentally happened to be a relative of Jean Garcin (the farmer who had made a witness statement the day before), {{reported to}} the police in Laragne that he had passed the location at 3.50 am on 5 August and had seen one of the car's doors open and a fairly tall man standing over the raised bonnet, <b>holding</b> a <b>lamp</b> <b>in</b> his hand.|$|R
50|$|The temple houses rare sculptures {{from the}} Nayak {{period in the}} Veerappa Nayak Mandap. There are {{exquisite}} carvings in the pillars and life size images indicating various legends of Hindu Puranas. The Jeeyar mandap houses lot of pillars with images of ladies <b>hold</b> <b>lamps</b> as <b>in</b> Kerala temples. The seer of temples used to rest at this place during festivals. The Sorga vasal (gateway to heaven) is located {{to the west of}} Yagasalai Mandap and is open only during the ten-day Vaikunta Ekadasi festival. Manimandap has numerous pillars with sculptures of elephants and yalis. The composite columns of Virabhadra holding sword and horn are found be additions of the Vijayanayagara kings during the early 1500s. Similar columns of Virabhadra are found in Adikesava Perumal Temple at Thiruvattaru, Meenakshi Temple at Madurai, Nellaiappar Temple at Tirunelveli, Kasi Viswanathar temple at Tenkasi, Ramanathaswamy Temple at Rameswaram, Soundararajaperumal temple at Thadikombu, Srivilliputhur Andal temple, Srivaikuntanathan Permual temple at Srivaikuntam, Avudayarkovil, Vaishnava Nambi and Thirukurungudivalli Nachiar temple at Thirukkurungudi.|$|R
50|$|After manically {{running through}} the grove {{in front of the}} house, she stops on the road leading to the house. In the background, her pursuer {{approaches}} <b>holding</b> a <b>lamp.</b> However, <b>in</b> this moment Laura is almost run over by Nestor (the owner) who is riding his pickup truck and who {{was on his way to}} the house in the middle of the night. The pursuer's lamp is shut down immediately. Although Laura's clothes are covered in blood and the fact that she tells Nestor about the attack, the latter does not seem convinced and insists on searching the house.|$|R
60|$|As he spoke, Margaret {{appeared}} descending {{the broad}} oak stairs which {{led into the}} ante-room. <b>Holding</b> a <b>lamp</b> <b>in</b> her hand, she was in full light, whereas the two men stood in the shadow. She wore a low-cut dress of crimson velvet, embroidered about the bodice with dead gold, which enhanced the dazzling whiteness of her shapely neck and bosom. Round her throat hung a string of great pearls, and on her head was a net of gold, studded with smaller pearls, from beneath which her glorious, chestnut-black hair flowed down in rippling waves almost to her knees. Having her father's bidding so to do, she had adorned herself thus that she might look her fairest, not {{in the eyes of}} their guest, but in those of her new-affianced husband. So fair was she seen thus that d'Aguilar, the artist, the adorer of loveliness, caught his breath and shivered at the sight of her.|$|R
50|$|Étant donnés (Given: 1. The Waterfall, 2. The Illuminating Gas, French: Étant donnés: 1° la chute d'eau / 2° le gaz d'éclairage.) is Marcel Duchamp's {{last major}} art work which {{surprised}} {{most of the}} art world, who believed {{he had given up}} art for competitive chess almost 25 years earlier, following The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (also known as The Large Glass). It is a tableau, visible only through a pair of peep holes (one for each eye) in a wooden door, of a nude woman lying on her back with her face hidden and legs spread <b>holding</b> a gas <b>lamp</b> <b>in</b> the air in one hand against a landscape backdrop.|$|R
50|$|Looking {{much like}} a long-barrel pistol, the Ronson Pisto-Lighter was {{exhibited}} at the 1912 Olympia (UK) car show on the Klaxon stand. It consisted of a file-like member which was drawn up {{the barrel of the}} pistol against a strong spring, and when the trigger was pressed it was released rubbing against a 'flinty substance' contained in the cap where the front sight of the pistol would be. This action was said to produce a constellation of sparks sufficient to light an acetylene <b>lamp</b> <b>in</b> the wildest <b>wind.</b> At the time acetylene lighting was standard for motor vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|The Pre-Islamic {{collection}} of the museum is derived from sites that include Volubilis, Banasa, Thamusida, Sala and Mogador, and which are organized by theme. The displays such as cooking utensils like plates, dishes, glasses and knives reveal much about every day life and Mediterranean relations in earlier times particularly between Morocco and Carthage. There are also the remnants of terracotta piping used in Roman public baths in Morocco. The museum has a noted {{collection of}} antique bronzes found mainly in Volubilis, including a bust of Cato the Younger from the 1st century and above all, the [...] Ephebe Crowned with Ivy bust which depicts an ephebe, a young soldier in training naked, wearing a crown of ivy and <b>holding</b> a <b>lamp</b> <b>in</b> his left hand. The Lustral Ephebe is also on display, discovered in Volubilis in 1929, as is the bust of Juba II dating back to 25 BC, originally imported from Egypt. The Dog of Volubilis was found in 1916, dating back to Hadrian in the early 2nd century.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] I answered; [...] "follow me," [...] and I {{led the way}} to a gallery, {{which we}} entered through an opening in the floor of the great chamber. It had been closed by a trap-door of stone, but the door was open. Creeping along this shaft, or passage, for some ten paces, we came at length to a well, seven cubits in depth. Making fast one end of the rope that I had brought about my body and the other to a ring in the rock, I was lowered, <b>holding</b> the <b>lamp</b> <b>in</b> my hand, till I stood in the last resting-place of the Divine Menkau-ra. Then the rope was drawn up, and Cleopatra, being made fast to it, was let down by the eunuch, and I {{received}} her in my arms. But I bade the eunuch, sorely against his will, since he feared to be left alone, await our return {{at the mouth of the}} shaft. For it was not lawful that he should enter whither we went.|$|R
25|$|Duchamp's final major {{art work}} {{surprised}} {{the art world}} that believed {{he had given up}} art for chess 25 years earlier. Entitled Étant donnés: 1° la chute d'eau / 2° le gaz d'éclairage ("Given: 1. The Waterfall, 2. The Illuminating Gas"), it is a tableau, visible only through a peep hole in a wooden door. A nude woman can be seen lying on her back with her face hidden, legs spread, and one hand <b>holding</b> a gas <b>lamp</b> <b>in</b> the air against a landscape backdrop. Duchamp had worked secretly on the piece from 1946 to 1966 in his Greenwich Village studio while even his closest friends thought he had abandoned art. The torso of the nude figure is based on Duchamp's lover, the Brazilian sculptor Maria Martins, with whom he had an affair from 1946 to 1951.|$|R
60|$|It was night, {{about ten}} o'clock indeed, the hour at which Alan {{generally}} went to bed. No message {{had come and}} he began to hope that the Asika had forgotten, or changed her mind, and {{was just going to say}} so to Jeekie when a light coming from behind him attracted his attention and he turned to see her standing in a corner of the great room, <b>holding</b> a <b>lamp</b> <b>in</b> her hand and looking towards him. Her gold breastplate and crown were gone, with every other ornament, and she was clad, or rather muffled in robes of pure white fitted with a kind of nun's hood which lay back upon her shoulders. Also on her arm she carried a shawl or veil. Standing thus, all undecked, with her long hair fastened in a simple knot, she still looked very beautiful, more so than she had ever been, thought Alan, for the cruelty of her face had faded and was replaced by a mystery very strange to see. She did not seem quite like a natural woman, and that was the reason, perhaps, that Alan for the first time felt attracted by her. Hitherto she had always repelled him, but this night it was otherwise.|$|R

60|$|I was {{determined}} to wait up for his return, so I piled some coals upon the fire and took down a novel from the shelf. My thoughts proved {{more interesting than the}} book, however, and I threw it on one side. An indefinable feeling of anxiety and depression weighed upon me. Twelve o'clock came, and then half-past, without any sign of my friend. It was nearly one when I heard a step in the street outside, and then a knocking at the door. I was surprised, as I knew that my friend always carried a key--however, I hurried down and undid the latch. As the door flew open I knew in a moment that my worst apprehensions had been fulfilled. Barrington Cowles was leaning against the railings outside with his face sunk upon his breast, and his whole attitude expressive of the most intense despondency. As he passed in he gave a stagger, and would have fallen had I not thrown my left arm around him. Supporting him with this, and <b>holding</b> the <b>lamp</b> <b>in</b> my other hand, I led him slowly upstairs into our sitting-room. He sank down upon the sofa without a word. Now that I could get a good view of him, I was horrified to see the change which had come over him. His face was deadly pale, and his very lips were bloodless. His cheeks and forehead were clammy, his eyes glazed, and his whole expression altered. He looked like a man who had gone through some terrible ordeal, and was thoroughly unnerved.|$|R

But he, who prefers to stay away from my periphery, will confront death from all directions! Even his corpse will not be secure. [...] Who is it who enters my citadel? Only he who discards all vice and instead embraces the path of rectitude. He who gives up the path of crookedness and treads along the path of truthfulness.

The luminaire directs the light obliquely over the desk, with the highest illuminance typically about 1' to 1½' to the side of the lamp head.

Asymmetric lamps often cause more reflected glare than other <b>lamps.</b> <b>In</b> workplaces where people use different table heights, an asymmetric lamp may cause direct glare due to its absence of means for glare control (ref:1).|$|R
