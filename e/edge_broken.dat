50|$|Steel grit characterizes grains with a {{predominantly}} angular shape. These grains are obtained by crushing steel shot, therefore they exhibit sharp <b>edges</b> and <b>broken</b> sections. Harder than steel shot, {{it is also}} available in different sizes and hardnesses.|$|R
60|$|The {{use of the}} abacus is eminently to equalise the {{pressure}} {{over the surface of}} the bell, so that the weight may not by any accident be directed exclusively upon its edges. In proportion to the strength of these edges, this function of the abacus is superseded, and these edges are strong in proportion to the steepness of the slope. Thus in Fig. XXVI., the bell at a would carry weight safely enough without any abacus, but that at c would not: it would probably have its <b>edges</b> <b>broken</b> off. The abacus superimposed might be on a very thin, little more than formal, as at b; but on c must be thick, as at d.|$|R

The five-page notice also included photographs and descriptions of rough diamonds from the Marange fields: [...] "On first sight, strong 'gravel' impression resembling rounded pebbles in a riverbed.

Most surfaces are matt (sic) and dulled with rounded corners and <b>edges.</b> <b>Broken</b> surfaces display 'metallic-like' lustre." [...] The report also contains photographs showing Marange diamonds {{in various stages of}} processing, so they can be recognized if they are mixed in with a legitimate diamond export.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved edge detection algorithm for facial and {{remotely sensed images}} using vector order statistics. The developed algorithm processes colored images directly without been converted to gray scale. A number of the existing algorithms converts the colored images into gray scale before detection of edges. But this process leads to inaccurate precision of recognized edges, thus producing false and <b>broken</b> <b>edges</b> in the output edge map. Facial and remotely sensed images consist of curved edge lines which have to be detected continuously to prevent <b>broken</b> <b>edges.</b> In {{order to deal with}} this, a collection of pixel approach is introduced with a view to minimizing the false and <b>broken</b> <b>edges</b> that exists in the generated output edge map of facial and remotely sensed images.

40|$|The tensile {{strength}} of composite plates with unidirectional cords {{depends on the}} way the load is distributed within the matrix by the cords. Of particular interest is the effect of a <b>broken</b> <b>edge</b> cord or a number of in-line fractured edge cords on the breaking strength of the plate when it is subjected to axial loading. This paper describes a model for estimating the maximum allowable number of broken tensile members in a bonded composite plate before catastro-phic failure occurs. The model has application to the analysis of steel-cord and Kevlar-cord elastomer belts containing <b>broken</b> <b>edge</b> cords as the result of impact damage. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{watershed}} transform {{was proposed}} {{as a novel method}} for image segmentation over 30 years ago. Today {{it is still}} used as an elementary step in many powerful segmentation procedures. The watershed transform constitutes one of the main concepts of mathematical morphology as an important region-based image segmentation approach. However, the original watershed transform is highly sensitive to noise and is incapable of detecting objects with <b>broken</b> <b>edges.</b> Consequently its adoption in domains where imaging is subject to high noise is limited. By incorporating a high-order energy term into the original watershed transform, we proposed the viscous force watershed transform, which is more immune to noise and able to detect objects with <b>broken</b> <b>edges.</b> ...|$|R

Process B checks whether the edge deletion does not break the component to which it belongs, and if it does not, again both processes halt.|$|R

The method is implemented in Matlab, and tested on a broken spherical surface...|$|R
