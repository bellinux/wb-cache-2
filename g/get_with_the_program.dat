40|$|Abstract: In Canada, current federal learning-and-work {{policy is}} focused on {{individual}} learner-worker development using an iteration of lifelong learning as cyclical. Increasing numbers of disenfranchised young adults are resisting participation in such learning. In this regard, I consider the predicament of young adults in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. To help us think about adequately addressing the dislocation they experience in life and work, I offer a Freire-informed vision of a critical social pedagogy of learning and work. Current Canadian federal learning-and-work policy aims to enhance the social as an effect of enhancing the economic. Such policy {{is focused on}} individual learner-worker development using an iteration of lifelong learning as cyclical. In this neoliberal milieu, cyclical lifelong learning has become not only a norm, but also a culture and an attitude. It is focused on assimilation, conditioning workers to <b>get</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> which is framed in neoliberal pragmatic terms. Still a current Canadian phenomenon indicates that increasing numbers of young adults are disengaging from participation in such learning {{that the federal government}} considers being a preventative measure.

40|$|This project {{evaluates the}} sutability and {{practicality}} of <b>the</b> <b>program</b> Athena Vortex Lattice (AVL) by Mark Drela. A short user guide was written {{to make it}} easier (especially for stu-dents) to <b>get</b> started <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> AVL. AVL was applied to calculate the induced drag and the Oswald factor. In a first task, AVL was used to calculate simple wings of different aspect ratio A and taper ratio lambda. The Oswald factor was calculated as a function f(lambda) {{in the same way as}} shown by HOERNER. Compared to HOERNER's function, the error never exceed 7. 5 %. Surprisingly, the function f(lambda) was not independent of aspect ratio, as could be assumed from HOERNER. Variations of f(lambda) with aspect ratio were studied and general results found. In a second task, the box wing was investigated. Box wings of different h/b ratio: 0. 31, 0. 62 and 0. 93 were calculated in AVL. The induced drag and Oswald factor in all these cases was calculated. An equation, generally used in the literature, describes the box wing's Oswald factor with parameters k 1, k 2, k 3 and k 4. These parameters were found from results obtained with AVL by means of the Excel Solver. In this way the curve k = f(h/b) was ploted.

Methods and Results—Data from acute ischemic stroke patients treated with tPA within 3 hours of symptom onset in 1082 hospitals participating in <b>the</b> <b>Get</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> Guidelines–Stroke <b>Program</b> from April 1, 2003, to September 30, 2009 were studied to determine frequency, patient and hospital characteristics, and temporal trends in patients treated with door-to-needle times 60 minutes. Among 25 504 ischemic stroke patients treated with tPA, door-to-needle time was 60 minutes in only 6790 (26. 6 %). Patient factors most strongly associated with door-to-needle time 60 minutes were younger age, male gender, white race, or no prior stroke. Hospital factors associated with 60 minute door-to-needle time included greater annual volumes of tPA-treated stroke patients. The proportion of patients with door-to-needle times 60 minutes varied widely by hospital (0 % to 79. 2 %) and increased from 19. 5 % in 2003 to 29. 1 % in 2009 (P 0. 0001).

40|$|Background—We {{sought to}} {{determine}} if intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) use for acute ischemic stroke increased in Massachusetts in association <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Primary Stroke Service program, a statewide stroke center designation and quality improvement initiative. Methods and Results—We analyzed prospectively acquired data from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health between October 2004 and June 2008, including 10 045 consecutive emergency department–based acute ischemic stroke encounters arriving 3 hours after stroke onset at 69 participating Massachusetts PSS hospitals. The overall rate of IV tPA use was 854 of 3866 (22. 1 %) of patients arriving 2 hours of symptom onset. IV tPA use increased steadily from 2005 (the first full year of <b>the</b> <b>program)</b> to 2008 (18. 4 %, 21. 9 %, 22. 6 %, 25. 5 %; P 0. 001).
