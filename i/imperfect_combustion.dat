60|$|The {{climate of}} the {{southern}} part of America appears particularly favourable to the production of peat. In the Falkland Islands almost every kind of plant, even the coarse grass which covers the whole surface of the land, becomes converted into this substance: scarcely any situation checks its growth; some of the beds are as much as twelve feet thick, and the lower part becomes so solid when dry, that it will hardly burn. Although every plant lends its aid, yet in most parts the Astelia is the most efficient. It is rather a singular circumstance, as being so very different from what occurs in Europe, that I nowhere saw moss forming by its decay any portion of the peat in South America. With respect to the northern limit at which the climate allows of that peculiar kind of slow decomposition which is necessary for its production, I believe that in Chiloe (latitude 41 to 42 degrees), although there is much swampy ground, no well-characterised peat occurs: but in the Chonos Islands, three degrees farther southward, we have seen that it is abundant. On the eastern coast in La Plata (latitude 35 degrees) I was told by a Spanish resident who had visited Ireland, that he had often sought for this substance, but {{had never been able to}} find any. He showed me, as the nearest approach to it which he had discovered, a black peaty soil, so penetrated with roots as to allow of an extremely slow and <b>imperfect</b> <b>combustion.</b>|$|E
60|$|Endless {{were the}} things we had to destroy in those great purgings. First, there were nearly all the houses and {{buildings}} of the old time. In the end we did not save in England one building in five thousand that was standing when the comet came. Year by year, as we made our homes afresh {{in accordance with the}} saner needs of our new social families, we swept away more and more of those horrible structures, the ancient residential houses, hastily built, without imagination, without beauty, without common honesty, without even comfort or convenience, in which the early twentieth century had sheltered until scarcely one remained; we saved nothing but what was beautiful or interesting out of all their gaunt and melancholy abundance. The actual houses, of course, we could not drag to our fires, but we brought all their ill-fitting deal doors, their dreadful window sashes, their servant-tormenting staircases, their dank, dark cupboards, the verminous papers from their scaly walls, their dust and dirt-sodden carpets, their ill-designed and yet pretentious tables and chairs, sideboards and chests of drawers, the old dirt-saturated books, their ornaments--their dirty, decayed, and altogether painful ornaments--amidst which I remember there were sometimes even STUFFED DEAD BIRDS!--we burnt them all. The paint-plastered woodwork, with coat above coat of nasty paint, that in particular blazed finely. I have already tried to give you an impression of old-world furniture, of Parload's bedroom, my mother's room, Mr. Gabbitas's sitting-room, but, thank Heaven! there is nothing in life now to convey the peculiar dinginess of it all. For one thing, there is no more <b>imperfect</b> <b>combustion</b> of coal going on everywhere, and no roadways like grassless open scars along the earth from which dust pours out perpetually. We burnt and destroyed most of our private buildings and all the woodwork, all our furniture, except a few score thousand pieces of distinct and intentional beauty, from which our present forms have developed, nearly all our hangings and carpets, and also we destroyed almost every scrap of old-world clothing. Only a few carefully disinfected types and vestiges of that remain now in our museums.|$|E
60|$|This is most {{important}} for us as we proceed with our subject. Air is absolutely necessary for combustion; and, what is more, I must have you understand that fresh air is necessary, or else we should be imperfect in our reasoning and our experiments. Here is a jar of air. I place it over a candle, and it burns very nicely in it at first, shewing that what I have said about it is true; but there will soon be a change. See how the flame is drawing upwards, presently fading, and at last going out. And going out, why? Not because it wants air merely, for the jar is as full now as it was before; but it wants pure, fresh air. The jar is full of air, partly changed, partly not changed; {{but it does not}} contain sufficient of the fresh air which is necessary for the combustion of a candle. These are all points which we, as young chemists, have to gather up; and if we look a little more closely into this kind of action, we shall find certain steps of reasoning extremely interesting. For instance, here is the oil-lamp I shewed you--an excellent lamp for our experiments--the old Argand lamp. I now make it like a candle [obstructing the passage of air into the centre of the flame]; there is the cotton; there is the oil rising up it; and there is the conical flame. It burns poorly, because there is a partial restraint of air. I have allowed no air to get to it, save round the outside of the flame, and it does not burn well. I cannot admit more air from the outside, because the wick is large; but if, as Argand did so cleverly, I open a passage {{to the middle of the}} flame, and so let air come in there, you will see how much more beautifully it burns. If I shut the air off, look how it smokes; and why? We have now some very interesting points to study. We have the case of the combustion of a candle; we have the case of a candle being put out by the want of air; and we have now the case of imperfect combustion; and this is to us so interesting, that I want you to understand it as thoroughly as you do the case of a candle burning in its best possible manner. I will now make a great flame, because we need the largest possible illustrations. Here is a larger wick [burning turpentine on a ball of cotton]. All these things are the same as candles, after all. If we have larger wicks, we must have a larger supply of air, or we shall have less perfect combustion. Look now at this black substance going up into the atmosphere; there is a regular stream of it. I have provided means to carry off the imperfectly burned part, lest it should annoy you. Look at the soots that fly off from the flame: see what an <b>imperfect</b> <b>combustion</b> it is, because it cannot get enough air. What, then, is happening? Why, certain things which are necessary to the combustion of a candle are absent, and very bad results are accordingly produced; but we see what happens to a candle when it is burnt in a pure and proper state of air. At the time when I shewed you this charring by the ring of flame on the one side of the paper, I might have also shewn you, by turning to the other side, that the burning of a candle produces the same kind of soot--charcoal or carbon.|$|E

40|$|Background: As {{time goes}} by, {{there is a}} {{significant}} increase on number of vehicle, particularly motorcycle. This condition results on higher vehicle emission released on air. Motorcycle emission produced from <b>imperfect</b> engine <b>combustion</b> contains dangerous substances that may harm genes configuration on human bodies, such as lead and polyaromatic hydrocarbon. Those substances are called genotoxic substances. A person whose occupation is connected with vehicle gas {{is more likely to be}} exposed with the emission than the one who is not on the vehicle-related occupation. Emission inhaled regularly would accumulate on nasal and mouth cavities of the exposed person. The accumulation of genotoxic substances could damage the cell nuclei. Nucleus damage could manifest as micronucleus, or additional nucleus in smaller size than the original nucleus. The effect of motorcycle emission to the frequency of micronucleus formation needs to be found as this would give rise to cancer prevalence, particularly on mouth cavity. Aim: To understand the effect of exposure on motorcycle emission to the increase of micronucleus formation frequency in mouth cavity on the motorcycle mechanics. Method: This research was conducted using cross-sectional study with primary data, which is the mucosal swab of mouth cavity. The case group was motorcycle mechanics, while the control group was citizen of Jogjakarta, with 35 samples for each group. Results: There was a significant difference of micronucleus count from case and control group (p= 0. 000), and the mean of micronucleus on motorcycle mechanics was 11. 375 and 5. 323 on control group. Conclusion: There is an effect of exposure on motorcycle emission to the increase of micronucleus formation frequency on the motorcycle mechanics compared to those who are less exposed to emission in their occupation.

40|$|Conventional diesel fuelled Partially-Premixed Compression Ignition (PPCI) engines {{have been}} {{investigated}} by many researchers previously. However, the ease of ignition and difficulty of vaporization of diesel fuel make it <b>imperfect</b> for PPCI <b>combustion.</b> In this study, Dieseline (blending of diesel and gasoline) was looked into as the Partially-Premixed Compression Ignition fuel for its combination of two fuel properties, ignition-delay-increasing characteristics and higher volatility, which make it more suitable for PPCI combustion compared to neat diesel. A series of tests were carried out on a Euro IV light-duty common-rail diesel engine, and different engine modes, from low speed/load to middle speed/load were all tested, under which fuel blend ratios, EGR rates, injection timings and quantities were varied. The emissions, fuel consumption and combustion stability of this dieseline-fuelled PPCI combustion were all investigated. The results showed that dieseline had great advantages as a PPCI combustion fuel in terms of emission reduction. This was particularly significant at high-speed engine mode. It was also found that with a blend of 50 % gasoline in diesel, the particle numbers total concentration could be reduced by 90 % while low NOx level and high brake fuel conversion efficiency (around 30 %) were maintained at all the loads tested. © 2011 SAE International...|$|R

But biodiesel has several disadvantages those are lower its caloric value and viscosity compared to diesel fuel. In this thesis, the effect of temperature on the viscosity and density of palm oil biodiesel and diesel fuel was studied experimentally.

30|$|This may be mainly {{attributed}} to the differences of unburnt carbon content and grain surface structure between the two kinds of coal ashes. CFBC ashes have higher unburnt carbon content and more porous surface morphology as compared with PCC fly ash (Table  1; Fig.  2).

It has been well known that amorphous carbon exhibits strong adsorption ability due to its loose and porous structure.

Therefore, it gives a summary information about the evaluation of the risk degree for the origin of spontaneous ignitions of the brown coal. The presented way of evaluation is based on a numeric expression of a value for MHU criteria – the point load of particular indicators is added together with other results gained from this research project. Then, more information is taken from companies running the dumps of brown coal products – both for suppliers (mining companies) and big consumers (power engineering). The complex knowledge about prediction of the origin of the spontaneous ignition enables to make an early response to eliminate a threat of mining fire in open pit mines or on the dumps of coal products. Consequently, it reduces the risk of fire and breakdowns of transportation means DPD, heavy machines and preparation plants.

40|$|Urban air {{contains}} {{various kinds}} of organic pollutants. Among them, several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nitropolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (NPAHs) are carcinogenic and/or endocrine disrupting. PAHs and NPAHs in the atmosphere mainly originate from <b>imperfect</b> <b>combustion</b> of organic matter, such as petroleum and coal. In this study, total suspended particles (TSP) were collected in three different particulate size fractions by using Andersen low-volume air samplers in Shenyang, Shanghai and Fuzhou, China, {{in the winter and}} summer seasons in 2010. Nine PAHs and twelve NPAHs in the extracts from the TSP were analyzed by HPLC with fluorescence detection and chemiluminescence detection, respectively. The mean concentrations of the sums of the nine PAHs and twelve NPAHs were highest in Shenyang and lowest in Fuzhou. In each city, more than 80 % of the total PAHs and total NPAHs were found in the fine particulate fraction (< 2. 1 μm). All PAHs and NPAHs were clearly higher in the winter than in the summer. Furthermore, the ratio of the molar concentrations of 1 -nitropyrene to pyrene ([1 -NP]/[Pyr]), which is a suitable indicator to estimate the contribution of diesel-engine vehicles and coal combustion to urban TSP, were smaller in Shenyang in the winter. However, in Shanghai, Fuzhou and Shenyang (summer), the [1 -NP]/[Pyr] ratios were close to those of particulates released from diesel-engine automobiles. Our study showed that the major contributors of atmospheric PAHs and NPAHs were diesel-engine vehicles both in the winter and the summer in Shanghai and Fuzhou, and in the summer in Shenyang. However, in the winter in Shenyang, atmospheric PAHs and NPAHs seemed to be affected by the mixture of coal combustion systems, such as coal heating and diesel-engine vehicles. 2010 年の冬季及び夏季に中国の東部に位置する瀋陽，上海及び福州で総浮遊粒子状物質をアンダーセン式ローボリウムエアサンプラーを用いて粒径別（＜ 2. 1 μm， 2. 1 ～ 7 μm，＞ 7 μm）に捕集した．強い発がん性または内分泌かく乱性を有する 9 種の多環芳香族炭化水素（PAH）と 12 種のニトロ多環芳香族炭化水素（NPAH）をそれぞれ高速液体クロマトグラフ（HPLC）蛍光検出法，HPLC化学発光検出法で分析した．その結果， 3 都市の大気中PAH，NPAH濃度はいずれも冬高夏低の季節変動を呈し，また季節によらず瀋陽で最も高く，福州で最も低いことが分かった．また 3 都市の大気中PAH，NPAHの 80 ％ 以上は呼吸器への沈着率の高い微小粒子画分（＜ 2. 1 μm）に存在した．さらに，大気中PAH，NPAHの主要発生源の識別マーカーであるピレンに対する 1 -ニトロピレン濃度比を 3 都市で比較した結果，上海，福州及び夏季の瀋陽の大気中PAH，NPAHの主要発生源がディーゼル車であり，冬季の瀋陽はディーゼル車と石炭暖房施設の両方であることが明らかになった...|$|E

Flight activity in this airport increases every year, with an increase of 20 % from 2011 {{until the end of}} 2012. The research aimed to identify how much the LTO (Landing-Take-Off) emission activity in I Gusti Ngurah Rai Bali International Airport. The purpose of this research was to identify how much the emission is and the effect of LTO activities towards the ambient air condition of CO and NOx around the airport. Three measurement points and three days recent flight were applied to understand the emission spreading characteristic in every LTO phases. The three phases of LTO which are consisted of take-off phase, taxi in phase and landing phase, were the main focus of this research. The three recent flights were on Monday 5 of May, on Wednesday 7 of May and on Saturday 10 of May in 2014. Regression bifilar linear statistical analysis method was employed to identify the effect and how big the CO and NOx emission contribution towards the ambient air quality. The results of this research showed that the emission of aircraft activity in LTO phases was effected by the ambient air concentration of CO and NOx. It was proved with the result from F test simultaneous with significant level average 0, 033 < 0, 005 and with r value that exists between 0, 77 – 0, 97 with mean contribution was 79, 1 %.

40|$|Biomass is an {{important}} energy carrier since it is a renewable source and the energy content in the fuel can be stored over time and also generate high temperatures. Bioenergy can be in liquid form, gas-phase or solid. The most common phase is as a solid. Before use, the biomass needs harvesting and refining. Pelletization {{is one of the}} most promising solid fuel qualities with a wide range of benefits which are needed before the product can enter the market and compete with more traditional sources of energy like heating oil and electricity. Despite its benefits, the pellet market still requires development. Several barriers need to be lifted such as understanding the market behavior, finding how bioenergy systems are adapted and what the level of technology is. Pellet feedstock is normally bi-products from sawmills, but increasing demand makes other feedstock alternatives interesting. Pulpwood from pine, straw and husk from agriculture and residue from the furniture industry are examples of new types of feedstock for pellet production. Different feedstocks can bring challenges due to the mechanical properties of the pellet fuel. Also chemical properties can be demanding if the inorganic content in the feedstock is high. The main objectives of the present work are divided into three selected areas; small scale pellets users in Norway, pretreatment of pure feedstock from pine and manufacturing of low-grade feedstock pellets with additives. The following research questions were settled for the work: 1) Which factors lead single household owners to choose wood pellet stoves compared to heat pump solutions and direct electrically heated systems? 2) How will existing users of wood pellets stoves choose if they should have any new system? 3) What is the practical experience of existing wood pellet stove users with aspects like the technical properties of fuel, stove or stakeholders? 4) How does extended storage of pine feedstock affect the mechanical pellet quality? 5) How does high and low temperature drying of pine feedstock affect the mechanical pellet quality? 6) How is the mechanical quality properties of pellets affected by the use of different selected additives? 7) Is the low-grade feedstock pellets made with additives combustible in ordinary grate furnaces/boilers? 8) How are the ash melting properties of difficult fuels affected by the use of selected additives? The research questions are aimed to solve by investigation of market penetration of wood pellet stoves through a survey. Further new pellet feedstocks like pulpwood, agricultural and furniture residues have been produced and tested. Also mixtures with different additives have been produced. The purpose of additives is mechanical fuel quality improvement and increasing the melting point of the ash in the fuel. Finally the new pellet fuel assortments were combusted and tested. All experiments and data collections performed this work is done in an industrial context. Chipping, grinding and pelletization were performed in ordinary industrial plants. Feedstock samples are collected from ordinary harvesting or side-product processes. Combustion is performed in ordinary furnaces/boilers. All processes mentioned above were set up with necessary measurement equipment. This way of experiment approaches have given good validity of the results from the experiments. The market investigation work was performed by a questionnaire among 188 random non-wood pellet users and 461 wood pellet users in Norway. The survey reached a response rate of 45 % from the existing wood pellet users. Factors that influence the decision of purchasing a heating system were identified like the age of the consumer, regional constraints in the availability of pellets and also that economic competitiveness is also weak compared to electrical heating. It was also found that pellet stoves need technical improvements to meet the end-user expectations. The ignition, control system, noise and <b>imperfect</b> <b>combustion</b> are examples of technical factors which need improvement. New pellet feedstocks need treatment prior to the pelletization process. Such process steps are chipping, grinding, storage, drying and possibly the use of additives. In this thesis, several feedstock assortments were manufactured. Pine pulp was stored outside for a year and dried at both high and low temperatures. The high temperature dried material and also stored material resulted in higher energy use for pelletization. There was lower energy consumption for fresh, low temperature dried material. Fresh material was found to have higher durability. Barley straw, barley husk and residue from furniture contain a larger amount of ash and a higher concentration of problematic ash-forming elements compared to conventional woody biomasses. This causes normally severe ash sintering and slagging which were observed in this study. Different raw feedstock were pelletized and combusted together with different additives. These additives might have multifunction such as: 1) improve the properties of fuel pellets from the mechanical point of view and 2) abate fuel ash slagging to achieve an efficient and smooth combustion process. In this work, each raw feedstock was pelletized with different additives in various additive-to-fuel ratios. The influence of additive addition on the pellet production process (i. e., power consumption) and pellet properties (i. e., bulk density, durability and particle density) were investigated. For furniture residue, both sewage sludge and marble sludge improved the durability of the pellets. But when there was a high content of marble, the durability was reduced and the levels of fines increased. Barley straw and barley husk durability were also improved with the lignosulfonate additive. With the marble sludge additive the barley husk durability was increased. Opposite barley straw durability was lowered with marble sludge additive. With combinations of both additives, the positive effect of marble sludge additive for both the barley straw and barley husk was to some extent eliminated. There are significant differences between the composition and ash chemistry of the formed slags. The slag from wood wastes was dominated by K, Na, Si and Ca, which were completely melted and fused into large blocks. The results from the chemical composition analyses of slag samples suggest intensive formation and fusion of low temperature melting alkali silicates. For the barley straw and barley husk that are rich in Si, K, P and Ca, most of the K reacts with both P and Si in ash residues and forms ash melts containing low temperature melting potassium silicates and phosphates. The ash melts were not transported from the grate area in the furnace and gives thereby initiated and enhanced ash slagging which reduces the operation stability of the furnace. Lignosulfonate, marble sludge and sewage sludge are proposed as additives to mitigate ash slagging during the combustion of the studied fuels. Marble sludge served as the most efficient additive to eliminate ash slagging during the combustion of pelletized barley straw, barley husk and wood wastes, respectively. The addition of marble sludge led to the formation of high temperature melting calcium-rich alkali silicates and/or phosphates. This process was accompanied by a significant reduction in ash melts and slag formation. A less pronounced anti-slagging effect was observed from the combustion of lignosulfonate added to barley straw and barley husk pellets. However, the addition of lignosulfonate altered the ash chemistry and promoted the formation of high temperature melting potassium calcium phosphates in ash residues. As result of this, the fraction of ingoing fuel ash that forms slag decreased, and the slags had smaller size and a lower degree of sintering. The addition of sewage sludge slightly reduced the slag formation during the combustion of wood waste pellets. This occurred because sewage sludge contributed to the formation of high temperature melting alkali aluminum silicates. PhD i energi- og prosessteknikkPhD in Energy and Process Engineerin...|$|E
