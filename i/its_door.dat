5|$|In New York City, a {{man with}} a camera follows a woman from an {{elevator}} through a corridor to another elevator, where all the people appear to be gray. He gets off on a floor before the woman and runs down the stairs. Lights flicker and the elevator cable snaps. As the man reaches the basement, the cab crashes and <b>its</b> <b>door</b> spills open to reveal the woman's wrist, covered with blood. The man begins to snap photos. Later, in Washington, D.C., FBI Assistant Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.) assigns Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), along with Agent Peyton Ritter from New York, to the case. Scully's partner Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) looks at the material on Scully's desk and points out that the case looks like an X-file—and that Kersh is obviously splitting them up.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{returns to}} the railcar, seeing <b>its</b> <b>door</b> ajar; an alien-human test subject is locked in a room inside. The Red-Haired Man attacks Mulder, causing the {{conductor}} to lock them both in the car. The Red-Haired Man claims {{to work for the}} NSA, and that a bomb in the car was triggered after he gained entry with Zama's pass code. Mulder doesn't believe him, but he is called by Scully on the Red-Haired Man's cell phone. Scully—who is with the First Elder in a similar railcar—tells Mulder that unwitting subjects, including herself, were operated on by Zama in the secret railway, with the alien abduction theory used as a smokescreen. She also confirms that a bomb is in the car and believes that the quarantined patient is infected with hemorrhagic fever. She fears that thousands will die from the disease if the car explodes. Mulder finds the bomb in the ceiling.|$|E
25|$|On September 2, Stadio Massimino finally reopened <b>its</b> <b>door</b> {{since the}} tragic events causing Raciti's death, hosting a Serie A 2007-08 game between Catania and Genoa, after the venue {{underwent}} major work to fulfil the newly introduced safety regulations.

25|$|The Marine Hospital {{was built}} in 1830–1831, and was used to provide care {{to members of the}} {{shipping}} community involved in the lumber trade. It is the oldest surviving marine hospital in Canada, and now serves as a hall for a local church and the general public. It last opened <b>its</b> <b>door</b> to patients in 1921, and was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in September 2000.|$|E
25|$|In 1864 {{the first}} large scale modern bank Hong Kong Shanghai Bank would be {{established}} turning Hong Kong into {{the focal point}} of financial affairs in Asia. Its chief manager, Sir Thomas Jackson, has a statue in Statue Square. The bank first leased Wardley House at HKD 500 a month in 1864.

25|$|González {{had a long}} scar {{across his}} left cheek that, {{according}} to his autobiography, {{some members of the}} mass media of the 1940s attributed to his being a Mexican-American pachuco and hence involved in knife fights. This was one more slur that embittered González towards the media in general. The scar was actually the result of a prosaic street accident in 1935 when he was seven years old: pushing a scooter too fast, he ran into a passing car and had his cheek gashed open by <b>its</b> <b>door</b> handle. He spent two weeks in the hospital as a result.|$|E
25|$|Japan was {{a closed}} country {{for more than}} two centuries, 1636 to 1853, since {{military}} rulers from the Tokugawa family wanted to keep foreigners away from Japanese society. The only exceptions were Chinese and some Dutch, but even they were discouraged from associating with Japanese citizens. Also, it was strictly prohibited by law for ordinary Japanese citizens to go abroad. Change came around the early 19th century when the visit of an American fleet commanded by Commodore Perry caused the new Japanese government to replace the Tokugawa system of economics and politics during the Meiji era in order to open <b>its</b> <b>door</b> to trade and contact with the outside world.|$|E
25|$|The iconostasis of {{the central}} {{sanctuary}} is made of ebony inlaid with ivory, and is surmounted by thirteen icons of the Virgin Mary and the Twelve Apostles. Above the icons is a rod depicting on each side a dragon and an eagle in conflict. Each eagle has a panel showing John the Baptist {{on the right and}} the Virgin Mary on the left. The southern sanctuary is dedicated to the angel Gabriel and <b>its</b> <b>door,</b> which dates to the Fatimid Period, is inlaid with ivory panels and has sculpted relief of birds and animals. A lofty dome ornamented with gated pendentives rises above the sanctuary. The altar canopy itself is shaped like a dome on four marble columns.|$|E

25|$|In 1995 the States of Jersey {{became the}} new owner of the Jersey Opera House {{at a cost of}} £1.3 million. In January 1997 the theatre closed for a major {{restoration}} project. A proposition was presented to the States of Jersey for a loan of £5.5 million to add to the £1.5 million that had been raised by the good will of the people and businesses of Jersey. This was successful and this major programme of work started in August 1998. After an extensive programme of rebuilding and renovation the new theatre opened <b>its</b> <b>door</b> on 9 July 2000 exactly 100 years to the day when the first Opera House had opened its doors to the public of Jersey.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} damaged {{watertight}} {{door of the}} firemen's tunnel, the watertight door between boiler rooms six and five failed to close properly. Water was flowing further aft into boiler room five. Britannic had reached her flooding limit. She could stay afloat (motionless) with her first six watertight compartments flooded. There were five watertight bulkheads rising {{all the way up}} to B Deck. Those measures had been taken after the Titanic disaster. (Titanic could float with her first four compartments flooded.) The next crucial bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four and <b>its</b> <b>door</b> were undamaged and should have guaranteed the ship's survival. However, there were open portholes along the lower decks, which tilted underwater within minutes of the explosion. The nurses had opened most of those portholes to ventilate the wards. As the ship's angle of list increased, water reached this level and began entering aft from the bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four. With more than six compartments flooded, Britannic could not stay afloat.|$|E
25|$|The dovecot at Tour below St Maurs-Glencairn Church is dated 1636 on <b>its</b> <b>door</b> lintel (not 1630 {{as stated}} by McNaught). It is {{rectangular}} on plan, with a centre ridge roof and crow-stepped gables. Only {{the foundations of the}} tower still exist, the remains having been taken down in the late 20th century. Kilmaurs was spelt Kylmawse in circa 1564 (1980). The fields below the kirk, running down to the footbridge over the Carmel are named in the 1860 OS. 'Broomy knowe', presumably named after broom and the knowe on which the old orchard was situated, lies {{to the left of the}} Tour rivulet. Bounded by the hedge on the right and the rivulet on the left is the 'Dovecot Fauld'. The Scots term 'fauld' means a meadow which is manured by keeping animals on it; pigeon droppings from the nearby dovecot seem to have been used, at least in part, judging from its name. Finally, the field on the other side of the hedge, running towards the Carmel is called 'Girnal', meaning a granary in Scots, suggesting that such a building once stood hereabouts. These fields seem to have formed the glebe of the kirk.|$|E

25|$|In July 1959 La Salle Green Hills (then spelled La Salle – Green Hills) opened <b>its</b> <b>door</b> to two preschool-level {{sections}} and one section each for elementary school units one and two. Its first Brother-Director was Brother Alphonsus Bloemen FSC who {{first came to}} teach in De La Salle College in Manila in 1940. On August 24, 1960, La Salle Green Hills, Inc. was registered as non-stock, non-profit corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In August 1964, the high school was established. In 1968, when the De La Salle High School – Manila was made defunct, graduates of the De La Salle Grade School were transferred to the La Salle Green Hills High School, making La Salle Green Hills the high school of De La Salle University – Manila, until {{the establishment of the}} co-educational De La Salle-Santiago Zobel School in 1978. The De La Salle Grade School – Manila was made defunct in 1983, after which male students were given an option to study either at LSGH (for northern and central Metro Manila residents) or at DLSZ (for southern Metro Manila residents).|$|E
25|$|Intelligence {{indicated}} that {{chemical and biological}} weapons stocks may have been located at a complex known as al Qadisiyah Research Centre along the shore of the al Qadisiyah reservoir among government and residential buildings, on the evening of 26 March, a DEVGRU assault element supported by B Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment assaulted the complex (codenamed Objective Beaver). Whilst the first of four MH-60Ks inserted the Rangers into their blocking positions, it was engaged by small arms fire from a nearby building, an AH-6M spotted the muzzle flashes and fired a 2.75inch rocket into the location silencing the small arms fire, the second MH-60K was also struck by small arms fire but <b>its</b> <b>door</b> gunner suppressed it. A-10As engaged nearby electricity transformers successfully blacking out the area, but it resulted in a series of explosions and a resulting fire at the stations that dramatically lit the sky – pinpointing the orbiting helicopters for enemy gunmen. Small arms fire increased as the final two MH-60Ks inserted their blocking teams, one Ranger was wounded, the two pairs of AH-6Ms and MH-60L DAPs supporting the mission continued to suppress targets as the four MH-47Es carrying the DEVGRU main assault force inserted under heavy enemy small arms fire whilst DEVGRU sniper teams aboard a pair of MH-6Ms engaged numerous gunmen and vehicles, one Nightstalker crew was wounded as the MH-47Es lifted off. The SEALs conducted a hasty SSE while the Ranger blocking positions received and returned fire, the AH-6Ms and the aerial snipers continued to engage enemy gunmen whilst the DAPs pushed further out to ensure no reinforcements approached - engaging and destroying numerous Fedayeen armed technicals. The SSE took longer than expected owing to the size and maze-like structure of the building, the mission completed after 45 minutes, later tests of the material recovered by DEVGRU showed no evidence of chemical or biological weapons at the Objective Beaver.|$|E

500|$|After {{learning}} of Oswald's release, the agents {{rush to the}} hospital to protect the Kiveats, but the power goes out when they arrive and Zero's corpse appears in the elevator when <b>its</b> <b>door</b> slides open. Oswald confronts Scully and Sharon, and the latter fearfully agrees to leave with him in return for her husband's safety. The sheriff arrives and tries to stop him. While pursuing a fleeing Sharon, Oswald summons lightning but ends up striking himself once again and, in the process, kills the sheriff. Oswald is put in a psychiatric hospital, although the local district attorney has no idea how {{they will be able to}} prosecute him. As the agents observe Oswald, he uses his powers to change the channels of the TV in his room. (The song [...] "Live Fast, Diarrhea" [...] by The Vandals is heard, presumably a band he liked as he wore multiple Vandals T-shirts) ...|$|E
500|$|Pryce was {{directly}} behind Stuck's car {{along the main}} straight. Stuck saw Jansen van Vuuren {{and moved to the}} right to avoid both marshals, missing Bill by what Tremayne calls [...] "millimetres". From his position Pryce could not see Jansen van Vuuren and was unable to react as quickly as Stuck had done. He struck the teenage marshal at approximately 270km/h (170mph). Jansen van Vuuren was thrown into the air and landed in front of Zorzi and Bill. He died on impact, and his body was badly mutilated by Pryce's car. The fire extinguisher he had been carrying smashed into Pryce's head, before striking the Shadow's roll hoop. The force of the impact was such that the extinguisher was thrown up and over the adjacent grandstand. It landed in the car park {{to the rear of the}} stand, where it hit a parked car and jammed <b>its</b> <b>door</b> shut.|$|E
500|$|The mall's opening {{helped create}} the impetus for growing {{economic}} and commercial developments for College Station. [...] Before its opening, the city {{did not have a}} highly developed retail community. It is now the largest taxpayer in College Station, and the second largest in the Brazos Valley, even though the anchor stores are freestanding units that are privately owned and taxed separate from the mall proper. Over 75 percent of retail sales in the Brazos Valley coming from sales at the mall's stores and it continues to be one if the area's largest employers as well as being the largest employer for Texas A students. As predicted, the Harvey Road/Earl Rudder Freeway intersection became a major entry point into College Station, with Harvey Road now boasting a long stretch of retail businesses and restaurants. It is considered an [...] "area of bustling activity" [...] by the city. According to Joan Ghani, the marketing director of the mall, the mall sees eleven million visitors walk through <b>its</b> <b>door</b> annually.
