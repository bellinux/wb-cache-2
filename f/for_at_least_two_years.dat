5|$|U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) {{documents}} declassified in 2006 {{show that}} the capture of Eichmann caused alarm at the CIA and West German Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND). Both organizations had known <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> that Eichmann was hiding in Argentina, but did not act, {{because it did not}} serve their interests in the Cold War to do so. Both were concerned about what Eichmann might say in his testimony about West German national security advisor Hans Globke, who had coauthored several antisemitic Nazi laws (including the Nuremberg Laws). The documents also revealed that both agencies had used some of Eichmann's former Nazi colleagues to spy on European communist countries.|$|E
5|$|Both second-round {{candidates}} and the incumbent president were initially {{arrested by the}} junta. Members of the Military Council, which ran the country until an interim National Transitional Council was established on 15 April, {{said that one of}} the reasons for the coup was the incumbent civilian administration's call for Angolan help to reform the military. Following international condemnation and sanctions against leaders of the junta, an agreement was signed that led to the third place candidate in the election, Manuel Serifo Nhamadjo, being selected as interim president. The presidential election was aborted and postponed <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> into the future. An interim government is tasked with administering Guinea-Bissau in the meantime.|$|E

William's movements during 1084 and 1085 are unclear– he was in Normandy at Easter 1084 but {{may have been in}} England before then to collect the danegeld assessed that year for the defence of England against an invasion by King Cnut IV of Denmark. Although English and Norman forces remained on alert throughout 1085 and into 1086, the invasion threat was ended by Cnut's death in July 1086.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1897, Clark {{attempted}} to secure protection for his holdings from the British South Africa Company. The Company took little notice of him. A local chief, Chintanda, {{complained to the}} Company in 1899 that Clark had secured his concessions while passing himself off as a Company official and had been collecting hut tax <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> under this pretence. The Company resolved to remove him from power, and did so in 1902. Clark then farmed for about two decades, with some success, and moved in the late 1910s to Broken Hill. There he became a prominent local figure, and {{a partner in the}} first licensed brewery in Northern Rhodesia. Remaining in Broken Hill {{for the rest of his}} life, he died there in 1927.|$|E
5|$|To {{serve as}} governor, {{one must be}} at least 30 years old, be a citizen of the United States, and have been a {{resident}} of the state <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> prior to election. The state constitution of 1876 originally called for election of the governor every two years, with their term beginning on the second Tuesday of the January following the election. An amendment passed in 1956, taking effect in 1959, increased terms to four years. Originally, there was no term limit applied to the governor; a 1990 amendment allowed governors to succeed themselves only once. There is however no limit on the total number of terms one may serve as long as one who has served the two term limit is out of office for four years.|$|E
5|$|After Preston won an FA Cup {{match against}} Upton Park in 1884, the Londoners protested, seeking the result to be {{overturned}} due to professionalism in the Preston ranks. This sparked {{a series of}} events which threatened to split the FA. Under Sudell's instruction, Preston withdrew from the competition. Fellow Lancashire clubs Burnley and Great Lever followed suit. The protest gathered momentum, to the point where more than 30 clubs, predominantly from the north, announced that they would set up a rival British Football Association if the FA did not permit professionalism. At the FA conference called to discuss the issue, Sudell {{was a member of the}} committee. He argued passionately for the acceptance of professionalism, but met opposition from southern-based amateur clubs, who viewed sport solely as a pastime. Backed by figures such as the more moderate but influential William McGregor of Aston Villa, the advocates of professionalism won the day and secured its acceptance. However, each club was permitted to only pay players who had been born or who had lived within six miles of the home stadium <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E

5|$|As the 1880s progressed, {{the balance}} of power within English {{football}} began to change. The first national competition, the FA Cup, had previously been dominated by amateur clubs from privileged backgrounds, such as Wanderers and Old Etonians. However the 1883 FA Cup Final saw the first victory by a working-class team, Blackburn Olympic. At this time professionalism was not permitted. Clubs from urban areas in the north were strong advocates of the practice, but the southern amateur teams and the FA authorities were firmly opposed. Though not initially an advocate of professionalism, McGregor came to favour its introduction. By 1885 the issue threatened to split the FA when a group of clubs, predominantly from Lancashire, announced their intention to leave and form a rival British Football Association if professionalism was not accepted. An emergency FA conference was called in response. Representing Aston Villa, McGregor spoke in favour of professionalism, the only delegate from the Midlands to do so, {{and was one of the}} few delegates to admit that his club had been paying players. Though not as outspoken as stronger proponents, such as Preston North End's William Sudell, McGregor was well respected. The conference ended with the FA accepting professionalism, although each club was permitted only to pay players who had been born or lived <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> within six miles of its home stadium.|$|E
5|$|Municipal {{elections}}, {{during which}} mayors are elected, take place every four years; they take place {{one year before}} presidential elections (since 2008) in the last Sunday of October. Candidates must comply a number of requisites in order {{to run for mayor}} of Pichilemu; those include: to have completed secondary education (Enseñanza Media), to be a citizen, literate, to have resided in the Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins Region <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> before the election, and to have their military status regularized. The mayor is usually sworn in on the 6 December following the election. The next election for the mayor will be in 2016. Municipal elections originally elected three mayors, called primer, segundo, and tercer alcalde, and a number of regidores. For example, the results of the first elections in Pichilemu, for the term between 1894 and 1897, showed José María Caro Martínez, Pedro Nolasco de Mira, and Francisco Reyes elected as the first primer, segundo, and tercer alcalde of Pichilemu, respectively. The role of the primer alcalde equals that of the current mayor of Pichilemu. However, voting was not popular: only taxpayers and landowners could vote. According to the Decree #5655 of 4 December 1945, regidores were popularly elected, and they had the faculty to vote for the mayor that would rule for the local government three-year term. The 1973 Chilean coup d'état interrupted Washington Saldías Fuentealba's mayoral term, hence terminating possibilities of new elections. The military regime of Augusto Pinochet appointed seven mayors, who held the office in a period of nineteen years. Following the Chilean transition to democracy, the D'Hondt method of proportional representation was used in the municipal elections of 1992, 1996, and 2000: all candidates run in a single list, the most voted candidate becomes the mayor and other five/six become councilors, according to the aforementioned method. For the municipal elections beginning in 2004, candidates for mayor and councilor run in separate lists, and mayors are elected by simple majority of votes.|$|E
