The film {{centers on}} a trio of {{homeless}} persons in Tokyo who discover a baby on Christmas Eve {{and set out to}} search for her parents. Tokyo Godfathers cost more to make than Kon's previous two films (with a budget of approximately 300,000,000 yen), and centered on the themes of <b>homelessness</b> and abandonment, with a comedic touch worked in. The screenplay was written by Keiko Nobumoto.|$|E
5|$|Ten is {{the debut}} studio album by American rock band Pearl Jam, {{released}} on August 27, 1991 through Epic Records. Following the disbanding of bassist Jeff Ament and guitarist Stone Gossard's previous group Mother Love Bone, the two recruited vocalist Eddie Vedder, guitarist Mike McCready, and drummer Dave Krusen to form Pearl Jam in 1990. Most {{of the songs}} began as instrumental jams, to which Vedder added lyrics about topics such as depression, <b>homelessness,</b> and abuse.|$|E
5|$|Wong {{stated that}} most people take for granted what they possess, and may be without {{identity}} or culture. Wong says his self-awareness, and what Hong Kong represents to him, stem from the years he spent abroad. He says that only by living amidst a second culture can one fully come to realise what one represents and where one belongs. A thread that runs through much of his work is therefore the notion of home, <b>homelessness</b> and wandering. Since 2011, his repertoire {{has taken on a}} political dimension.|$|E
5|$|About 0.3–0.7% {{of people}} are {{affected}} by schizophrenia during their lifetimes. In 2013 there were an estimated 23.6 million cases globally. Males are more often affected than females. About 20% of people do well and a few recover completely. Social problems, such as long-term unemployment, poverty and <b>homelessness</b> are common. The average life expectancy of people with the disorder is ten to twenty-five years less than for the general population. This {{is the result of}} increased physical health problems and a higher suicide rate (about 5%). In 2015 an estimated 17,000 people worldwide died from behavior related to, or caused by, schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|Another {{composition}} {{from the}} song genre, also mentioned by Fisk and others, as intimately {{related to the}} last sonatas, and also depicting a feeling of wandering and <b>homelessness,</b> is the Winterreise (A Winter's Journey) song cycle. Numerous connections between different songs from the cycle and the sonatas, especially the C minor Sonata, have been mentioned. For example: in the C minor Sonata, the first movement's development section recalls the songs Erstarrung and Der Lindenbaum; the second movement and the finale recall the songs Das Wirtshaus, Gefrorne Tranen, Gute Nacht, Auf dem Flusse, Der Wegweiser, and Einsamkeit. These allusions to Winterreise retain the alienated, lonely atmosphere of its songs.|$|E
5|$|During Season 5, it is {{revealed}} that Wilson's homeless brother Danny suffered from schizophrenia since adolescence, {{which is what}} caused him to run away. Wilson blames himself for his brother's <b>homelessness,</b> having hung up on Danny right before he disappeared. Wilson also reveals to House that he took the position at Princeton-Plainsboro because it was near the place he had last seen Danny. When Wilson finds out that Danny is in the Psychiatric Ward of New York Mercy Hospital , House offers to come with him to keep him company, noting that it could end badly. However, when Wilson is let in to see his brother, House is busy with a differential with his team.|$|E

5|$|Implementation of Care Not Cash {{began on}} July 1, 2004. As {{part of his}} Care Not Cash initiative, 5,000 more {{homeless}} people were given permanent shelter in the city. As of October 21, 2007, about 2,000 people have been placed into permanent housing with support. Other programs initiated by Newsom to end chronic <b>homelessness</b> include the San Francisco Homeless Outreach Team (SF HOT), and Project Homeless Connect (PHC). On October 27, 2004, during a strike by hotel workers on a dozen San Francisco hotels, Newsom joined UNITE HERE union members on a picket line {{in front of the}} Westin St. Francis Hotel. He vowed that the city would boycott the hotels by not sponsoring city events in any until the hotels agreed to a contract with workers. The contract dispute was settled in September 2006.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 he and Kenneth Adam {{initiated}} the new anthology series The Wednesday Play, a BBC equivalent of Armchair Theatre, which had great success and critical acclaim with plays {{written and directed}} by the likes of Dennis Potter, Jeremy Sandford and Ken Loach. The strand attracted comment and debate for several of its productions, such as Cathy Come Home, a Tony Garnett production of a Jeremy Sandford script, which dealt with the issue of <b>homelessness.</b> There were also problems caused by Newman bringing in freelance directors to work on the programme, who sometimes overspent on their plays to try and increase their impact; with staff directors this could be compensated by reducing the budget of a subsequent production, but for a freelancer there would be no such recourse.|$|E
5|$|Later, Momma {{decides to}} send her grandchildren to their mother in San Francisco, California, {{to protect them from}} the dangers of racism in Stamps. Maya attends George Washington High School and studies dance and drama on a {{scholarship}} at the California Labor School.

5|$|Castro's {{government}} emphasised social {{projects to}} improve Cuba's standard of living, often {{to the detriment}} of economic development. Major emphasis was placed on education, and during the first 30 months of Castro's government, more classrooms were opened than in the previous 30 years. The Cuban primary education system offered a work-study program, with half of the time spent in the classroom, and the other half in a productive activity. Health care was nationalized and expanded, with rural health centers and urban polyclinics opening up across the island to offer free medical aid. Universal vaccination against childhood diseases was implemented, and infant mortality rates were reduced dramatically. A third part of this social program was the improvement of infrastructure. Within {{the first six months of}} Castro's government, 600 miles of roads were built across the island, while $300 million was spent on water and sanitation projects. Over 800 houses were constructed every month in the early years of the administration in an effort to cut <b>homelessness,</b> while nurseries and day-care centers were opened for children and other centers opened for the disabled and elderly.|$|E
5|$|Dean Lyons {{was born}} on 20 April 1973; he was 24 when he was arrested. He grew up in Tallaght in West Dublin, the fourth {{in a family of}} six children. He went to Scoil Aonghusa National School in Tallaght, where he had some {{difficulty}} with his schoolwork. According to his teachers, in today's terms, he would have been classified as having a moderate general learning disability. He was assessed by a psychologist when he was in sixth class, around the age of twelve, who found him to have an intelligence quotient of 70. As a result of the psychologist's report, Lyons was moved to St. Joseph's Special School in Tallaght. During his period in St. Joseph's, he developed a reputation for attention seeking and storytelling. After school, he never held down a steady job and drifted into heroin addiction and <b>homelessness.</b> At the time of his arrest for the Grangegorman murders, he had one conviction for burglary, and had been involved in a number of syringe robberies.|$|E
5|$|From 1969 to 1973, it {{used oil}} {{money to fund}} social welfare programs, which led to house-building {{projects}} and improved healthcare and education. House building became a major social priority, designed to eliminate <b>homelessness</b> and to replace the shanty towns created by Libya's growing urbanization. The health sector was also expanded; by 1978, Libya had 50% more hospitals than it had in 1968, {{while the number of}} doctors had grown from 700 to over 3000 in that decade. Malaria was eradicated, and trachoma and tuberculosis greatly curtailed. Compulsory education was expanded from 6 to 9 years, while adult literacy programs and free university education were introduced. Beida University was founded, while Tripoli University and Benghazi University were expanded. In doing so the government helped to integrate the poorer strata of Libyan society into the education system. Through these measures, the RCC greatly expanded the public sector, providing employment for thousands. These early social programs proved popular within Libya. This popularity was partly due to Gaddafi's personal charisma, youth and underdog status as a Bedouin, as well as his rhetoric emphasizing his role as the successor to the anti-Italian fighter Omar Mukhtar.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Rowland officially became {{ambassador}} for MTV's Staying Alive Foundation, {{which aims to}} reduce stigma against people living with HIV and AIDS. She visited projects in Tanzania and Kenya to promote the charity, and underwent an HIV test in Africa {{to raise awareness of}} the disease. In 2009, Rowland connected with Serve.MTV.com, MTV's platform to connect young people with local volunteerism opportunities, for a series of on-air PSAs. From battling <b>homelessness</b> to beautifying impoverished neighborhoods to saving whales, Rowland was joined by the likes of Cameron Diaz, will.i.am, and Sean Kingston as they discuss causes they volunteer to support, and urge young people to join with their friends in making civic service a part of their lifestyle. That same year, she spearheaded a bone marrow drive, and joined fellow singers Alesha Dixon and Pixie Lott to create T-shirts for River Island in aid of the Prince's Trust, profits from which help change young lives.|$|E

Jew once served as vice chairman of the San Francisco County Republican Central Committee before re-registering as an Independent and then as a Democrat.|$|E
5|$|On January 25, 2017, Baker {{proposed}} a $40.5 billion state budget {{for fiscal year}} 2018, and on March 9, 2017, legislative hearings began to review it. Tax changes proposed in Baker's 2018 budget proposal include extending the state sales tax to online retailers without physical storefronts or offices in-state, a requirement that credit card companies send a 1099 tax form to individuals earning more than $600 from credit and debit card transactions, extending the state's hotel tax to room-sharing services and individuals who rent out rooms for more than 150 days a year, and a $2,000-per-employee assessment on employers that do not offer health insurance to counter spending growth in the state Medicaid program, MassHealth.

5|$|Since Reagan {{left office}} in 1989, {{substantial}} debate has occurred among scholars, historians, {{and the general}} public surrounding his legacy. Supporters have pointed to a more efficient and prosperous economy as a result of Reagan's economic policies, foreign policy triumphs including a peaceful end to the Cold War, and a restoration of American pride and morale. Proponents also argue Reagan restored faith in the American Dream with his unabated and passionate love for the United States, after a decline in American confidence and self-respect under Jimmy Carter's perceived weak leadership, particularly during the Iran hostage crisis, as well as his gloomy, dreary outlook {{for the future of the}} United States during the 1980 election. Critics contend that Reagan's economic policies resulted in rising budget deficits, a wider gap in wealth, and an increase in <b>homelessness</b> and that the Iran–Contra affair lowered American credibility.|$|E
5|$|Tomlinson {{was born}} to Jim and Ann Tomlinson in Matlock, Derbyshire. He moved to London when he was 17 {{to work as a}} scaffolder. At the time of his death, at the age of 47, he was working casually as a vendor for the Evening Standard, London's evening newspaper. Married twice with nine children, {{including}} stepchildren, Tomlinson had a history of alcoholism, as a result of which he had been living apart from his second wife, Julia, for 13 years, and had experienced long periods of <b>homelessness.</b> He had been staying since 2008 in the Lindsey Hotel, a shelter for the homeless on Lindsey Street, Smithfield, EC1. At the time of his death, he was walking across London's financial district in an effort to reach the Lindsey Hotel, his way hampered at several points by police lines. The route he took was his usual way home from a newspaper stand on Fish Street Hill outside Monument tube station, where he worked with a friend, Barry Smith.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{bidirectional}} {{relationship between}} <b>homelessness</b> and poor health.

25|$|Housing First was {{initiated}} by the federal government's Interagency Council on <b>Homelessness.</b> It asks cities {{to come up with}} a plan to end chronic <b>homelessness</b> under the assumption that if homeless people are given independent housing immediately with some social and financial support, then there will be reduced needs for emergency homeless shelters.|$|E
25|$|A {{substantial}} {{percentage of}} the US homeless population are individuals who are chronically unemployed or have difficulty managing their lives effectively due to prolonged and severe drug and/or alcohol abuse. Substance abuse can cause <b>homelessness</b> from behavioral patterns associated with addiction that alienate an addicted individual's family and friends who could otherwise provide support during difficult economic times. Increased wealth disparity and income inequality causes distortions {{in the housing market}} that push rent burdens higher, making housing unaffordable. Dr. Paul Koegel of RAND Corporation, a seminal researcher in first generation <b>homelessness</b> studies and beyond, divided the causes of <b>homelessness</b> into structural aspects and then individual vulnerabilities.|$|E
