5|$|According to this {{traditional}} account, Rome had been {{ruled by a}} succession of kings. The Romans believed that this <b>era,</b> <b>that</b> of the Roman kingdom, began in 753 BC and ended in 510 BC. After {{the overthrow of the}} monarchy and the establishment of the Republic, the people of Rome began electing two consuls each year. According to the consular fasti, a list of the consuls going back to the foundation of the Republic, the first consuls were chosen in 509 BC.|$|E

The stars had a private bar, the Blues Club, built on the set, for themselves, crew, and friends. Carrie Fisher, Aykroyd's girlfriend at the time, says most of the bar's staff doubled as dealers, procuring any drug patrons desired.|$|E

The questions of performance-enhancing drug use, which dogged later home run hitters such as McGwire and Bonds, do nothing to diminish Ruth's reputation; his overindulgences with beer and hot dogs seem part of a simpler time.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the New York City Subway, which opened in 1904, helped bind the new city together, as did additional bridges to Brooklyn. In the 1920s Manhattan experienced large arrivals of African-Americans {{as part of the}} Great Migration from the southern United States, and the Harlem Renaissance, part of a larger boom time in the Prohibition <b>era</b> <b>that</b> included new skyscrapers competing for the skyline. New York City became the most populous city in the world in 1925, overtaking London, which had reigned for a century.

5|$|The pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} in {{its heyday}} was {{the core of a}} very diverse navy. Many older ironclads were still in service. Battleships served alongside cruisers of many descriptions: modern armoured cruisers which were essentially cut-down battleships, lighter protected cruisers, and even older unarmoured cruisers, sloops and frigates whether built out of steel, iron or wood. The battleships were threatened by torpedo boats; it was during the pre-dreadnought <b>era</b> <b>that</b> the first destroyers were constructed to deal with the torpedo-boat threat, though {{at the same time the}} first effective submarines were being constructed.|$|E
5|$|A Free Ride, {{also known}} as A Grass Sandwich, is a stag film of the silent <b>era</b> <b>that</b> is {{considered}} to be the earliest extant American hardcore pornographic movie. It depicts a motorist who picks up two women from the roadside and later engages in several sex acts with them. Although most scholars consider A Free Ride a 1915 film, some sources claim that it was produced later. The film's director used a pseudonym and the cast remained anonymous. The filming location is not known, although it may have been produced in New Jersey. Two contradictory theories have emerged regarding the identities of the cast: some sources suggest they were people with low social status, but others assert the opposite. The Kinsey Institute has a print of the film in its collection. A Free Ride was screened at the inauguration of the Museum of Sex. In 2004, Lisa Oppenheim, a New York-based artist, remade the film.|$|E
5|$|According to Swedish legend, Charles XI {{travelled}} {{around the}} country dressed as a farmer or simple traveller. In the legend he {{is referred to as}} the Greycoat (Swedish: Gråkappan). This was done to discover and identify corruption and oppression against the populace.

He was always followed by a military cortège but he was one of the kings in Sweden during this <b>era</b> <b>that</b> travelled the most throughout the country. The stories of the Greycoat were published in a book by Arvid August Afzelius in the middle of the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|After the {{succession}} of King George I in 1714, the arrangement of a commission of Lords of the Treasury {{as opposed to a}} single Lord High Treasurer became permanent. For the next three years, the government was headed by Lord Townshend, who was appointed Secretary of State for the Northern Department. Subsequently, Lord Stanhope and Lord Sunderland ran the government jointly, with Stanhope managing foreign affairs and Sunderland managing domestic affairs. Stanhope died in February 1721 and Sunderland resigned two months later; Townshend and Robert Walpole were then invited to form the next government. From that point, the holder of the office of First Lord also unofficially held the status of Prime Minister. It was not until the Edwardian <b>era</b> <b>that</b> the title Prime Minister was constitutionally recognised. With only few exceptions, the Prime Minister still holds the office of First Lord by constitutional convention.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s, James Bond movies, bomba (soft porn) {{pictures}} and {{an era of}} musical films, produced mostly by Sampaguita Pictures, dominated the cinema. The second golden age occurred from 1970s to early 1980s. It was during this <b>era</b> <b>that</b> filmmakers ceased to produce pictures in black and white. A rise in Hollywood films dominated theater sales during the late 1980s until the 2000s. The dawn of this era saw a dramatic decline of the mainstream Philippine movie industry. In the year 2009, however, presence of box-office films in the Philippine Box Office has surged. The mid 2010s also saw broader commercial success of films produced by independent studios.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} years of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction <b>Era</b> <b>that</b> followed, Congress {{repeatedly}} debated the rights of black former slaves freed by the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation and the 1865 Thirteenth Amendment, the latter of which had formally abolished slavery. Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress, however, Republicans grew concerned over the increase it would create in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern States. Because the full population of freed slaves would now be counted for determining congressional representation, rather than the three-fifths previously mandated by the Three-Fifths Compromise, the Southern States would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives, regardless of whether the former slaves were allowed to vote. Republicans began {{looking for a way to}} offset this advantage, either by protecting and attracting votes of former slaves, or at least by discouraging their disenfranchisement.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} years of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction <b>Era</b> <b>that</b> followed, Congress {{repeatedly}} debated the rights of the millions of black former slaves. By 1869, amendments had been passed to abolish slavery and provide citizenship and equal protection under the laws, but the election of Ulysses S. Grant to the presidency in 1868 convinced a majority of Republicans that protecting the franchise of black male voters was important for the party's future. On February 26, 1869, after rejecting more sweeping versions of a suffrage amendment, Congress proposed a compromise amendment banning franchise restrictions on the basis of race, color, or previous servitude. After surviving a difficult ratification fight, the amendment was certified as duly ratified and part of the Constitution on March 30, 1870.|$|E
5|$|It was in {{the later}} medieval <b>era</b> <b>that</b> the borders of Scotland reached {{approximately}} their modern extent. The Isle of Man fell under English control in the 14th century, despite several attempts to restore Scottish authority. The English were able to annexe a large slice of the lowlands under Edward III, but these losses were gradually regained, particularly while England was preoccupied with the Wars of the Roses (1455–85). In 1468 the last great acquisition of Scottish territory occurred when James III married Margaret of Denmark, receiving the Orkney Islands and the Shetland Islands in payment of her dowry. However, in 1482 Berwick, a border fortress and the largest port in medieval Scotland, fell to the English once again, for {{what was to be}} the final change of hands.|$|E

5|$|Marian devotion {{grew from}} the 13th century, mostly forming around the {{concepts}} of the Immaculate Conception and her Assumption into heaven. In a culture that venerated the possession of relics {{as a means to}} bring the earthly closer to the divine, Mary left no bodily relics, thus assuming a special position between heaven and humanity. By the early 15th century, Mary had grown in importance within the Christian doctrine to the extent that she was commonly seen as the most accessible intercessor with God. It was thought that the length each person would need to suffer in limbo was proportional to their display of devotion while on earth. The veneration of Mary reached a peak in the early 15th century, an <b>era</b> <b>that</b> saw an unending demand for works depicting her likeness. From the mid-15th century, Netherlandish portrayals of the life of Christ tended to be centred on the iconography of the Man of Sorrows.|$|E
