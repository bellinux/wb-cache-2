ABS is offered or comes standard on most road vehicles produced today {{and is the}} foundation for electronic stability control systems, which are rapidly increasing in popularity due to the vast reduction in price of vehicle electronics over the years.|$|E
50|$|Vehicle wheels may lock-up due to {{excessive}} wheel torque over tire-road friction forces available, caused by too much hydraulic line pressure. The ABS monitors wheel speeds and releases pressure on individual wheel brake lines, rapidly pulsing individual brakes to prevent lock-up. During heavy braking, preventing wheel lock-up helps the driver maintain steering control. Four channel ABS systems have an <b>individual</b> <b>brake</b> line {{for each of}} the four wheels, enabling different braking pressure on different road surfaces. Three channel systems are equipped with a sensor for each wheel, but control the rear brakes as a single unit. For example, less braking pressure is needed to lock a wheel on ice than a wheel which is on bare asphalt. If the left wheels are on asphalt and the right wheels are on ice, during an emergency stop, ABS detects the right wheels about to lock and reduces braking force on the right front wheel. Four channel systems also reduce brake force on the right rear wheel, while a three channel system would also reduce force on both back wheels. Both systems help avoid lock-up and loss of vehicle control.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} braking system characteristics, brake system performance and brake system component design parameters that influence brake pedal force / displacement characteristics as ‘felt’ by the driver in a passenger car. It includes detailed studies of <b>individual</b> <b>brake</b> system component design parameters, operation, and the linear and nonlinear characteristics of internal components through experimental study and simulation modelling. The prediction of brake pedal ‘feel’ in brake system simulation has been achieved using the simulation modelling package AMESim. Each <b>individual</b> <b>brake</b> system component was modelled individually before combining them into the whole brake system {{in order to identify}} the parameters and the internal components characteristics that influence the brake pedal ‘feel’. The simulation predictions were validated by experimentally measured data and demonstrated the accuracy of simulation modelling. Axisymmetric Finite Element Analysis (using the ABAQUS software) was used to predict the behaviour of nonlinear elastomeric internal components such as the piston seal and the booster reaction disc which was then included in the AMESim simulation model. The seal model FEA highlighted the effects of master cylinder and caliper seal deformation on the brake pedal ‘feel’. The characteristics of the brake booster reaction disc were predicted by the FEA and AMESim simulation modelling and these results highlighted the importance of the nonlinear material characteristics, and their potential contribution to brake pedal ‘feel’ improvement. A full brake system simulation model was designed, prepared, and used to predict brake system performance and to design a system with better brake pedal ‘feel’. Each of the brake system component design parameters was validated to ensure that the braking system performance was accurately predicted. The critical parameter of brake booster air valve spring stiffness was identified to improve the brake ‘pedal ‘feel’. This research has contributed to the advancement of automotive engineering by providing a method for brake system engineers to design a braking system with improved pedal ‘feel’. The simulation model can be used in the future to provide an accurate prediction of brake system performance at the design stage thereby saving time and cost...|$|E

Increasing highway traffic congestion and high cost of ics. building new highways have brought out a renewed design of an Automated Highway System (AHS). Since safety is an important issue in the development of an AHS, fault-tolerant control in the brake system is vital. In this thesis, nonlinear failure detection filters are used for fault detection of sensors and actuators in a class of nonlinear systems.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{designed}} to validate {{a new approach to}} understeer mitigation chassis control, based on a particle motion reference: parabolic path reference (PPR). Considering the scenario of excess entry speed into a curve, related to run-off-road crashes, the aim is that automatic braking minimizes lateral deviation from the target path by using an optimal combination of deceleration, cornering forces and yaw moments. Previous simulation studies showed that four-wheel braking can achieve this much better than a conventional form of yaw moment control (DYC). The aim of this work is to verify this on a test track with an experimental vehicle, and to compare performance with DYC and an uncontrolled vehicle. Experiments were performed with a front-wheel-drive passenger vehicle equipped with an additional four identical brake callipers controlled via an electro-hydraulic brake (EHB) system, enabling <b>individual</b> <b>brake</b> control. Minimizing the maximum deviation from the intended curve radius is the control objective. Feedback to the controller consists of the available steering wheel angle, wheel speeds, yaw rate and lateral acceleration sensors in the vehicle. Additional to these variables, also the vehicle position was logged using a GPS system. It was found that PPR is superior to DYC in reducing the maximum deviation from the intended path, confirming the trends previously found in simulations. Furthermore, the PPR concept is found to be inherently more stable than DYC since more brake force is applied to the outer wheels than the inner wheels throughout the manoeuvre. The experiments involve a first implementation of a PPR control which is not a fully closed-loop control intervention and tuned to a step steer (transition from straight to fixed-radius curve. This is the first study to explicitly and systematically evaluate this new approach to understeer mitigation. The approach is fundamentally different from common DYC and suggests the potential {{for a new generation of}} controllers based on trajectory control via chassis actuators...|$|E

Because the internal resistance of the device was low, the same force was being applied by both individuals, yet the task was much easier for the <b>individual</b> <b>braking.</b> This demonstration cleverly revealed that a tiny female resisting the movement of the pedals could easily exert more force than, and hence control the power output of, a large burly male pedaling forward.|$|R

40|$|Transportation safety {{has been}} {{recognized}} {{as a public health}} issue worldwide, consequently, transportation researchers and practitioners have been attempting to provide adequate safety performance for the various transportation components and facilities to all road users given the usually scarce resources available. Safety engineers have been trying to make decisions affecting safety based on the knowledge extracted from different types of statistical models and/or observational before-after analysis. It is generally recognized that this type of factual knowledge is not easily obtained either statistically or empirically. Despite the intuitive link between road safety and observed crashes, a good understanding of the sequence of events prior to the crash can provide a more rational basis for the development of engineering countermeasures. The development of more comprehensive mechanistic models for safety assessment is heavily dependent on detailed vehicle tracking data that is not readily available. The potential of microscopic simulation in traffic safety and traffic conflict analysis has gained increasing interest mostly due to recent developments in human behaviour modelling and real-time vehicle data acquisition. In this thesis, we present a systematic investigation of the use of existing behavioural microscopic simulation models in short-term road safety studies. Initially, a microscopic framework is introduced to identify potentially unsafe vehicle interactions for different vehicle movements based on three types of traffic behaviour protocols: car-following, lane change and gap acceptance. This microscopic model for safety assessment applies a safety performance measure based on pairwise comparisons of spacing and speed differential between adjacent vehicles and <b>individual</b> <b>braking</b> power in real-time. A calibration/validation procedure using factorial analysis is presented to select best model input parameters for this safety performance measure by using high resolution vehicle tracking data. The ability of the proposed safety performance measure to reflect real-life observed high-risk vehicular interactions is explored in three intuitive tests using observed crash data. Finally, the usefulness of the model is illustrated through its application to investigate the safety implications of two different geometric and operational traffic strategies. The overall results indicate that, notwithstanding the fact that actual behavioural microscopic algorithms have not been developed strictly to model crashes, they are able to replicate several factors directly related to high risk situations that could lead to crashes with reasonable accuracy. With the existing upward trend in computing power, modelling techniques and increasing availability of detailed vehicle tracking data, it is likely that safety studies will be carried out using a more mechanistic and inclusive approach based on disruptive driving behaviour rather than ultimate unpredictable and heavily restrictive crash events...|$|R
