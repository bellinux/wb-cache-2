5|$|There are an {{infinite}} number of other intermediate processes in which more and more photons are absorbed and/or emitted. For each of these possibilities there is a Feynman diagram describing it. This implies a complex computation for the resulting probability amplitudes, but provided it is the case that the more complicated the diagram the less it contributes to the result, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of time and effort to find as accurate an answer as one wants to the original question. This is the basic approach of QED. To calculate the probability of any interactive process between electrons and photons {{it is a matter of}} first noting, with Feynman diagrams, all the possible ways in which the process can be constructed from the three basic elements. Each diagram involves some calculation involving definite rules to find the associated probability amplitude.|$|E
25|$|Gastón is Amaranta Úrsula's wealthy, Belgian husband. She marries him in Europe {{and returns}} to Macondo leading him on a silk leash. Gastón is about fifteen years older than his wife. He is an aviator and an adventurer. When he moves with Amaranta Ursula to Macondo he thinks <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of time before she realizes that her European ways are out of place, causing her to want {{to move back to}} Europe. However, when he realizes his wife intends to stay in Macondo, he {{arranges}} for his airplane to be shipped over so he can start an airmail service. The plane is shipped to Africa by mistake. When he travels there to claim it, Amaranta writes him of her love for Aureliano Babilonia Buendía. Gastón takes the news in stride, only asking that they ship him his velocipede.|$|E
500|$|Similarly, Clear also {{garnered}} {{mixed reviews}} in Final Destination 2. Robert Koehler of Variety said that Larter was cast little light; while Putman of TheMovieBoy.com admired that Larter accurately plays Clear as an emotionally worn-down {{young woman who}} may still be alive, but realizes that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of time before fate has its way with her. Nevertheless, Putman found her performance short. David Grove of Film Threat stated that she spends the whole movie looking miserable with her frigid acting; and criticized her and A. J. Cook as [...] "dumb blonde leads" [...] as well. Despite this, Robin Clifford of Reeling Reviews was favorable to Larter's performance, saying she was giving the smart-ass edge her character needs. Gallman of Oh, The Horror! claimed that Larter is again the bright spot; whereas Andrew Manning of Radio Free Entertainment positively acknowledged her, declaring that Larter rules the movie. Manning argued that while everyone else is merely a hastily assembled caricature without depth, Clear has a well-defined background and history with recognition to her appearance in the first film. He further affirmed that Final Destination fans will see Clear as the heroic franchise veteran.|$|E

2500|$|Talk of amalgamating the 6 {{municipal}} {{units in}} Pictou County {{has increased in}} recent years. Among the reasons for this, small towns adjacent to New Glasgow {{are having a hard}} time coping financially on their own due to the declining economy. Also, Pictou County has the most politicians per capita in Canada. With the Government of Nova Scotia having already amalgamated Halifax County, Cape Breton County, and Queens County into regional municipalities, Pictou County residents feel <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of time before that concept is introduced in Pictou County. The two most often suggested scenarios involve amalgamating the entire county (six municipalities) into a single regional municipality, or amalgamating the upper East River towns (New Glasgow, Stellarton, Trenton, Westville) into a single larger town. [...] After several months of public backlash a vote was held and the public spoke against amalgamation, effectively killing any possibility of a future merger.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ceiling of}} the Frere Hall, {{displays}} in bold, the words, [...] "Arz-o-Samawat" [...] (Earth and the Heavens) bears a historical significance, since it represents {{the last piece of}} work by Sadequain. He died before he could complete it. Before he started painting the stupendous mural on the ceiling he dedicated it to the citizens of the great city of Karachi. The mural is for the citizens to cherish and it should be treated as a national treasure. However, because of the security conditions the citizens are deprived of entry in Frere Hall and the impressive historical building along with the Mural lie in desperate need of care. The bright colours Sadequain used in the mural to depict the Earth and the Heavens are fading away because of the environmental conditions. The large mural is painted on dozens of individual panels that are put together like the pieces of a puzzle. Several of the panels are detached and hang down under their own weight. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of time before the panels start falling apart.|$|E

[...] All of them agreed that Gongsun Du would succeed if he did so. After Gongsun Du sought his opinion, Liang Mao replied, [...] "The Han Empire {{is in a state}} of chaos and on the brink of collapse. General, you command thousands of troops, yet you sit here and watch others attack and destroy each other. As a subject of the Han Empire, is this what you should be doing? Lord Cao is concerned about the Han Empire's future and the people's welfare, which is why he leads an army of righteousness to eliminate tyrants and villains. He has made immense contributions and his virtues are well-known. There is none other like him in the Han Empire. As peace and stability has just recently been restored, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of time before everyone starts pointing fingers at you, General, for not doing anything to save the Han Empire. Now, General, you want to lead your forces west to attack Ye? All it takes is one morning to find out the result of this test of survival and destruction. General, I hope you know what is good for you." [...] Gongsun Du's subordinates were shocked when they heard what Liang Mao said. After a long pause, Gongsun Du said, [...] "What Administrator Liang said is correct." ...|$|E
