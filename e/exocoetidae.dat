50|$|The <b>Exocoetidae</b> are {{a family}} of marine fish in the order Beloniformes class Actinopterygii. Fish of this family are known as flying fish. About 64 species are grouped in seven to nine genera. Flying fish can make powerful, {{self-propelled}} leaps out of water into air, where their long, wing-like fins enable gliding flight for considerable distances above the water's surface. This uncommon ability is a natural defence mechanism to evade predators.|$|E
5000|$|The term <b>Exocoetidae</b> is {{both the}} {{scientific}} name and the general name in Latin for a flying fish. The suffix -idae, common for indicating a family, follows {{the root of the}} Latin word , a transliteration of the Ancient Greek name [...] This means literally [...] "sleeping outside", from [...] "outside" [...] and [...] "bed", [...] "resting place", so named as flying fish were believed to leave the water to sleep on the shore.|$|E
5000|$|Like its {{relatives}} {{it feeds}} at sea, predominantly on squid, and fish, mostly flying fish (<b>Exocoetidae)</b> and goatfish (Mullidae).

As mentioned above, it does not only have the dramatic stiff-winged [...] "shearing" [...] (dynamic soaring) flight technique which gave the shearwaters their common name. In addition to it, it may use the plesiomorphic flight technique of petrels and similar Procellariidae, moving about with slow, leisurely wingbeats.|$|E
50|$|The great frigatebird forages in pelagic waters within 80 km (50 mi) of the {{breeding}} colony or roosting areas. Flying {{fish from the}} family <b>Exocoetidae</b> {{are the most common}} item in the diet of the great frigatebird; other fish species and squid may be eaten as well. Prey is snatched while in flight, either from just below the surface or from the air in the case of flying fish flushed from the water. Great frigatebirds will make use of schools of predatory tuna or pods of dolphins that push schooling fish to the surface. Like all frigatebirds they will not alight on the water surface and are usually incapable of taking off should they accidentally do so.|$|E
50|$|The {{order is}} {{sometimes}} divided up into two suborders, the Adrianichthyoidei and the Belonoidei. The Adrianichthyoidei contains {{only a single}} family, the Adrianichthyidae. Originally, the Adrianichthyidae {{were included in the}} Cyprinidontiformes and assumed to be closely related to the killifish, but a closer relationship to the beloniforms is indicated by various characteristics including the absence of the interhyal, resulting in the upper jaw being fixed or nonprotrusible. The Belonoidei may also be further subdivided into two superfamilies, the Scomberesocoidea and the Exocoetoidea. The Scomberesocoidea contains the Belonidae and Scomberesocidae, while the Exocoetoidea comprises the <b>Exocoetidae</b> and Hemiramphidae. However, newer evidence finds that the flyingfishes are nested within the halfbeaks, and the needlefish and sauries are nested within the subfamily Zenarchopterinae of the family Hemiramphidae, which has been recognized as its own family. The sauries are also nested within the family Belonidae.|$|E
5000|$|The {{transition}} of predominantly swimming locomotion directly to flight has evolved {{in a single}} family of marine fish called <b>Exocoetidae.</b> Flying fish are not true fliers {{in the sense that}} they do not execute powered flight. Instead, these species glide directly over the surface of the ocean water without ever flapping their [...] "wings." [...] Flying fish have evolved abnormally large pectoral fins that act as airfoils and provide lift when the fish launches itself out of the water. Additional forward thrust and steering forces are created by dipping the hypocaudal (i.e. bottom) lobe of their caudal fin into the water and vibrating it very quickly, in contrast to diving birds in which these forces are produced by the same locomotor module used for propulsion. Of the 64 extant species of flying fish, only two distinct body plans exist, each of which optimizes two different behaviors.|$|E

50|$|In the Azores fish made {{up all of}} {{the diet}} and the most {{important}} species in the diet of Sphyraena viridensis was the bluejack mackerel Trachurus picturatus being found as having been preyed upon by 72.4% of the fish sampled and making up nearly two thirds of the weight of prey taken. Other species taken in this study included single examples of bogue Boops boops, ornate wrasse Thalassoma pavo and axillary sea bream Pagellus acarnae, as well as an unidentified species of the <b>Exocoetidae.</b> Unidentofied fish remains were found in nearly 20% of the specimens sampled. In the same study the predatory behaviour of S.viridensis was observed and they are active pursuit predators of fish with one or many barracudas pursuing fish, either singling out lone prey or attacking shoals of prey fish. The pursuit was rapid and was usually over in 8-40 seconds and the more fish were involved the higher the rate of success was. In these observations other fish species than those sampled from specimens were observed as prey e.g. longspine snipefish Macrorhamphosus scolopax and boar fish Capros aper. It is also known to feed on cephalopods and crustaceans.In summer they form schools of up to 180 fish, although most schools number 30-40 fish, in areas where there are strong currents. These schools are predominantly made up of sub-adult fish with the smaller fish nearer to the surface and the larger, usually female, fish {{at the bottom of the}} school at depths of up to 30m. In winter the only aggregations are small groups of juveniles in shallow bays. No territorial behaviour was observed. Schooling is thought to be an anti predator defence and to facilitate mating with the smaller males being attracted to the larger females, in addition groups of barracudas were more successful in hunting prey fish than single fish. This species does not appear to mix with other barracuda species in mixed schools but there are reports of these fish associating with whale sharks in the Azores and an instance of them actively swimming towards a manta ray Mobula tarapacana.|$|E

30|$|The flyingfish family <b>Exocoetidae</b> is a {{group of}} small fish {{comprising}} 52 species and is distributed globally in the tropical and subtropical areas of three oceans (Nelson 2006; Chang et al. 2012 a; Xu et al. 2013). Exocoetids are low-tropical level species (Wu et al. 2010) and are a food source for dolphinfish, tuna, and swordfish (Oxenford and Hunte 1999; Wu et al. 2006). They are known as flyingfish due to their ability to glide in the air over the water using large and elongated pectoral and asymmetric caudal fins (Davenport 1994). This uncommon flying behavior serves as an escape mechanism from predators and is uniquely present in extant fish species of the <b>Exocoetidae</b> group as a homoplasy of the extinct family Thoracopteridae (Davenport 1994; Kutschera 2005; Xu et al. 2013).|$|E

40|$|The flyingfish family <b>Exocoetidae</b> is {{a diverse}} group of marine fishes that are {{widespread}} and abundant in tropical and subtropical seas. Flyingfishes are epipelagic specialists that are easily distinguished by their enlarged fins, which are used for gliding leaps over the surface of the water. Although phylogenetic hypotheses have been proposed for flyingfish genera based on morphology, no comprehensive molecular studies have been performed. In the present study, we describe a species-level molecular phylogeny for the family <b>Exocoetidae,</b> based on data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (1137 bp) and the nuclear RAG 2 gene (882 bp). We find strong support for previous morphology-based phylogenetic hypotheses, as well as the monophyly of most currently accepted flyingfish genera. However, the most diverse genus Cheilopogon is not monophyletic. Using our novel flyingfish topology, we examine previously proposed hypotheses for the origin and evolution of gliding. The results support the progressive transition from two-wing to four-wing gliding. We also use phylogenetic approaches to test the macroecological effects of two life history characters (e. g. egg buoyancy and habitat) on species range size in flyingfishes.  © 2010 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2011, 102, 161 – 174...|$|E
40|$|Seasonality was a {{stronger}} {{influence in the}} ichthyoplankton assemblages around the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago (SPSPA) than distance from the islands. Plastic debris were ubiquitous and although it presented diel trends, no other spatiotemporal patterns was showed. Larval Oxyporhamphus micropterus {{was the most important}} taxa (29. 37 % of the total catch), followed by Ceratoscopelus warmingii and Entomacrodus vomerianus. <b>Exocoetidae</b> eggs represented 41. 01 %. Mesopelagic fish larvae dominated the community. Myctophidae had the highest species richness (15). Four larval fish assemblages occured: (1) nighttime demersal/bathydemersal (Anguillidae, Congridae); (2) daytime mesopelagic/bathypelagic/epipelagic (Myctophidae, Cyclothone acclinidens); (3) daytime epipelagic (<b>Exocoetidae,</b> Coryphaena hippurus, Thunnus albacares) and (4) nighttime reef and demersal (Blennidae, Pomacentridae, Lutjanidae). The dry season (lower temperature, higher chlorophyll a and higher SW wind velocity) influenced the first two assemblages. The rainy season (higher temperatures and lower NW wind velocity) influenced the last two. Nighttime abundance of dominant species in the rainy season suggests diel vertical migration nearshore. Plastics were 2. 12 times more abundant than the most abundant fish larvae. Comparable amounts of larvae and plastics in the water column increase the chances of interaction between these two compartments and might disturb the local marine food web and promote the transfer of microplastic from one habitat to another, especially when smaller taxa contaminated by ingested fragments are preyed by migratory animals such as marine birds and tuna. A study around the area concluded that at least a part of the plastic debris can have local source due to fishing activities. Small-scale oceanographic mechanisms such as the interaction between the topography and currents (SEC and EUC) seem to be responsible for the retention of fish eggs, fish larvae and plastics around SPSPA...|$|E
30|$|Genetic {{analysis}} {{is a useful}} tool for species identification and the determination of population structure which could provide a scientific basis for fishery management (Ward 2000). The technique has been successfully utilized for the sustainable management of many economically and ecologically important fish, such as albacore and bigeye tunas (Ward 2000). For flyingfish, the molecular phylogeny of selected species of the <b>Exocoetidae</b> group has been reconstructed based on the mitochondrial cytochrome b and the nuclear RAG 2 genes (Lewallen et al. 2011). Other than this exception, research on population genetics of flyingfish is rare and previous studies all focused on Hirundichthys affinis (Gomes et al. 1998; Gomes et al. 1999, 2000).

40|$|SYNOPSIS. To {{investigate}} jaw {{evolution in}} beloniform fishes, we reconstructed the phylogeny of 54 species using fragments of two nuclear (RAG 2 and Tmo- 4 C 4) and two mitochondrial (cytochrome b and 16 S rRNA) genes. Our total molecular evidence topology refutes the monophyly of needlefishes (Belonidae) and half-beaks (Hemiramphidae), but supports the monophyly of flyingfishes (<b>Exocoetidae)</b> and sauries (Scombere-socidae). Flyingfishes are nested within halfbeaks, and sauries are nested within needlefishes. Optimization of jaw characters {{on the tree}} reveals a diverse array of evolutionary changes in ontogeny. During their development, needlefishes pass through a ‘‘halfbeak’ ’ stage that closely resembles the adult condition in the hemiramphid halfbeaks. The reconstruction of jaw transitions falsifies the hypothesis that halfbeaks are paedomorphic derivatives of needlefishes. Instead, halfbeaks make up a basal paraphyletic grade within beloniforms, and the needlefish jaw morphology is relatively derived. The parallel between needlefish on-togeny and beloniform phylogeny is discussed, and clades amenable to future morphological analysis are proposed...|$|E

This analysis indicates that sauries are most closely related to needlefishes, supporting the historical concept of the superfamily Scomberesocoidea as a monophyletic assemblage. A caudal displacement of the origin of the retractor dorsalis muscle is a tentative additional synapomorphy for all four saury species. Zenarchopteridae is strongly supported as a valid family sister to the Scomberesocoidea (decay index = 19, bootstrap = 100).
