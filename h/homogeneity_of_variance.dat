40|$|After a brief {{review of}} the literature, two {{non-parametric}} tests for <b>homogeneity</b> <b>of</b> <b>variances</b> are presented. The first test is based on the analysis of means for ranks, which is a non-parametric version of the analysis of means (ANOM) that uses ranks as input for an ANOM test. The second test uses inverse normal scores of the ranks of scale transformations of the observations as input to the ANOM. Both <b>homogeneity</b> <b>of</b> <b>variances</b> tests can be presented in a graphical form, which makes it easy for practitioners to assess the practical and the statistical significance. A Monte Carlo study is used to show that these tests have power comparable with that of well-known robust tests for <b>homogeneity</b> <b>of</b> <b>variances.</b> ...|$|R
30|$|Analysis <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> (ANOVA) {{was applied}} to {{determine}} which variable is statistically relevant for estimating incident duration.

The test is quite robust to violations of normality. Violating <b>homogeneity</b> <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> can be more problematic than in the two-sample case since the MSE is based on data from all groups.

In order to unveil whether xylogenesis (e.g. cell numbers, ring widths) was affected by site (altitude) we used Analysis <b>of</b> <b>Variance</b> (ANOVA).

5000|$|In statistics, a {{sequence}} or a vector of random variables is homoscedastic [...] if all random {{variables in the}} sequence or vector have the same finite variance.

The spellings homoskedasticity and heteroskedasticity are also frequently used.|$|E

MLM allows modeling of the variance-covariance matrix from the data; thus, unlike in RM-ANOVA, these assumptions are not necessary.|$|E
50|$|For the between-subject {{effects to}} meet the {{assumptions}} of the analysis of variance, the variance for any level of a group must {{be the same as}} the variance for the mean of all other levels of the group.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{evaluate}} {{the impact of the}} financial crisis on the integration of bond markets in the European Union (EU). The initial indicator is the average yield of medium-term government bonds in individual EU countries. Consequently, the 2005 – 2011 time period has been divided into two periods - before the financial crisis and during the financial crisis, and after the financial crisis. Furthermore, we have used the one-factor analysis <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> ANOVA and then compared the mean values in the indicated periods. In order for ANOVA to be carried out, first the assumptions <b>of</b> normality and <b>homogeneity</b> <b>of</b> <b>variances</b> <b>of</b> survey data have to be tested.

50|$|The F-test is {{sensitive}} to non-normality. In the analysis of variance (ANOVA), alternative tests include Levene's test, Bartlett's test, and the Brown-Forsythe test. However, when any of these tests are conducted to test the underlying assumption of homoscedasticity (i.e. <b>homogeneity</b> <b>of</b> <b>variance),</b> as a preliminary step to testing for mean effects, there {{is an increase in}} the experiment-wise Type I error rate.|$|E
50|$|In statistics, Levene's test is an {{inferential}} statistic used {{to assess}} the equality of variances for a variable calculated for two or more groups. Some common statistical procedures assume that variances of the populations from which different samples are drawn are equal. Levene's test assesses this assumption. It tests the null hypothesis that the population variances are equal (called <b>homogeneity</b> <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> or homoscedasticity). If the resulting p-value of Levene's test is less than some significance level (typically 0.05), the obtained differences in sample variances are unlikely to have occurred based on random sampling from a population with equal variances. Thus, the null hypothesis of equal variances is rejected and it is concluded that {{there is a difference between}} the variances in the population.|$|E
50|$|In statistics, a paired {{difference}} test {{is a type}} {{of location}} test that is used when comparing two sets of measurements to assess whether their population means differ. A paired difference test uses additional information about the sample that is not present in an ordinary unpaired testing situation, either to increase the statistical power, or to reduce the effects of confounders. Specific methods for carrying out paired difference tests are, for normally distributed difference t-test (where the population standard deviation of difference is not known) and the paired Z-test (where the population standard deviation of the difference is known), and for differences that may not be normally distributed the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. In addition to tests that deal with non-normality, there is also a test that is robust to the common violation of <b>homogeneity</b> <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> across samples (an underlying assumption of these tests): this is Welch's t-test, which makes use of unpooled variance and results in unusual degrees of freedom (e.g. df' = 4.088 rather than df = 4).|$|E

Data in the text and in the tables are given as mean[*]±[*]standard deviation (SD). Following Hopkins et al. (2009), we calculated the effect size of changes in age and swimming performance since {{the use of a}} p-value provides no information about the direction or the size of the effect.

We used a t-test in the other criteria in which <b>homogeneity</b> <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> was assumed. The results are summarized in Table 6.

30|$|Data were {{analyzed}} using SPSS version 15.0 (Chicago, IL, USA). All data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean.

One-way {{analysis of variance was}} performed at a significance level of 0.05 following the confirmation of normality and <b>homogeneity</b> <b>of</b> <b>variance.</b> Tukey’s test was used for multiple comparisons when statistical differences among groups were detected (P <  0.05).|$|E
30|$|For the {{narrative}} task, the assumptions were first checked.

Levene’s test of equality of error variances also indicated that the assumption of <b>homogeneity</b> <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> was not violated. The assumption of sphericity was tested by Mauchley’s sphericity test. The test was significant (p <[*]. 05) across the four rating elements; therefore, the degrees of freedom were adjusted with {{the values of the}} Greenhouse-Geisser test in the follow-up univariate analyses of variance (ANOVA).|$|E

To find an interaction between age and race distance on sex difference, a two-way ANOVA (age group[*]×[*]distance) with subsequent Bonferroni post-hoc test was used. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics (Version 19, IBM SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) and GraphPad Prism (Version 5, GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).
