40|$|Abstract — Storage {{is one of}} the {{important}} and vital stages among the marketing and consumption phases. Reinforced cement concrete (RCC) is an ideal structural material for building of permanent bulk storage facilities. RCC Bin can be flat <b>bottom</b> type or <b>hopper</b> <b>bottom</b> type. Although flat bottom bins can be built more easily than <b>hopper</b> <b>bottom</b> bins but it is desirable that bottom is self cleaning. It is because of this reason that <b>hopper</b> <b>bottom</b> bins are preferred. Specified the various parameters such as diameter of bin, height of bin, properties of the material to be stored (angle of repose and density), grade of steel, grade of concrete, the number of supports, and the components are designed. For every single case, support numbers have been varied in multiple of 2, starting from 4 say 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 etc. Conforming to the normal practice, the supports are assumed to be equally spaced alongside the periphery. For the designed components (ring girder dimensions, column cross-section, thickness of wall), depending upon diameter & height of the bins, influence coefficient matrix is then generated. The, parameters such as fundamental natural frequency and other frequencies in first 3 modes for bin full and bin empty conditions have been computed and the normalized Eigen values have been computed corresponding to first three modes. Then, static & dynamic analysis of bins has been carried out by taking elements at 2 m interval both in bin (full & empty) conditions.

40|$|Electrostatic {{precipitation}} is a {{well established}} technique to control the {{emission of particulate matter}} (fly ash or dust particles) from coal-fired thermal power stations. Flue gas conditioning, FGC, is a technique that involves addition of chemical agents to the flue gas in order to increase the collection efficiency of the Electrostatic Precipitators, ESPs. Several efforts have already been made by earlier researchers to characterize the fly ash from hoppers, to ascertain its suitability for various engineering applications. However, how characteristics of the fly ash inside the ESP, from one location to another, change has not yet been investigated in details. Such investigations would help in understanding the influence of flue gas conditioning on functioning of ESPs. With this in view, attempts were made to characterize the fly ash collected at various locations of the ESP unit of a power plant (viz., <b>hopper,</b> <b>bottom</b> portion, collection plate and Induced Draft (ID) fan).

STORED GRAIN VOLUME MEASUREMENT USING A LOW DENSITY POINT CLOUD. Applied Engineering in Agriculture, 33 (1), 105 - 112. doi: 10. 13031 /aea. 11870 This {{technical}} note presents {{the development of}} a new apparatus and data processing method to accurately estimate the volume of stored grain in a bin. Specifically, it was developed to account for the variability in surface topography that can occur in large diameter bins when partially unloaded. This was accomplished using a laser distance meter to create a low density point cloud, from which a surface was interpolated using ArcMap geoprocessing tools. The manually controlled and portable system was designed to hold the laser distance meter and provided a common reference point. The data from the laser distance meter was transmitted to a tablet PC via Bluetooth. Measurement of an empty <b>hopper</b> <b>bottom</b> bin (4. 6 m in diameter and 6. 5 m tall) demonstrated that the system was able to measure a known volume within 0. 02 %, and repeated measures of an empty flat bottom bin (1. 8 m in diameter, and 5. 7 m tall) were within 0. 29 % of the known volume.

The victim had been filling a <b>hopper</b> <b>bottom</b> grain bin with steamed flaked corn {{on the day of the}} incident. It appears that as the bin became full, the worker went into the top of the bin to level the corn as an attempt to store the remaining corn. As the worker was standing on the corn surface, a subterraneous bridged pocket apparently gave way, allowing the victim to become entrapped in the flowing corn. His body became submerged and he was unable to breathe. The victim’s wife became concerned when he did not return from work, and she then contacted both the feed mill and the emergency responders. A coworker discovered the victim entrapped in the grain bin. The victim had worked for this mill for the past 20 years. New York State Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (FACE) investigators concluded that to help prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, employers should: • Develop a comprehensive safety program that clearly documents procedures for safe entry into confined spaces, such as grain bins. This program should include, but should not be limited to: � Provision of at least one attendant, responsible for maintaining constant communication with the entrant, outside the confined space for the duration of entry operations; � Equipping confined spaces, such as grain bins, that contain unstable materials, with lifelines and harnesses at their entrance point(s) and training workers in their usage; � Strictly prohibiting workers from standing on or working from the surface of loose, granular materials, even when the surface appears stable. • Evaluate grain bins and storage facilities for retrofitting with mechanical fill level devices to minimize the need to enter grain storage bins; • Post signs at entrances to confined spaces, such as grain bins, that contain stored material...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryKingsly AmbroseConsistent and {{reliable}} flow of bulk wheat from hoppers and silos is very significant in wheat handling and processing. Bulk wheat flow challenges such as inconsistent flow, arching, etc., are common during handling. The irregular size and non-uniformity of physical properties, {{the presence of}} impurities affects the flow behavior during discharge. Chaff and insects infested kernels {{are the two most}} common impurities present in wheat. In this research, the effect of these two impurities on their physical and flow properties of wheat were studied. Physical and flow indicators, such as bulk, tapped, particle densities, angle of repose, Hausner’s ratio, Carr index, and porosity measures the flowability of uncompacted bulk solids. Meanwhile, flow properties tested by shear testing principle based on Jenike’s method, simulated bulk wheat under pressure in bins/hoppers. The dynamic properties tested quantify the energy required to flow, compressibility and permeability at dynamic handling situations. Due to the presence of impurities and moisture content differences, bulk density and angle of repose of wheat varied from 801. 54 kg/m 3 to 718. 36 kg/m 3, and 23. 6 ° to 38. 4 °, respectively. Angle of internal friction and wall friction angle that reflect interaction between particles and particle with bins/hopper walls, ranged from 23. 95 ° to 43. 13 ° and 15. 46 ° to 20. 33 °, respectively. In addition to instrumental flow property evaluation, the flow profile, discharge rate, and particle velocity during hopper flow of bulk wheat was studied using Particle Image Velocimetry method. Mass flow and funnel flow hopper dimensions were used for this flow profile analysis. The discharge rate decreased from 1. 67 to 1. 12 kg/s for mass flow and 1. 42 to 0. 86 kg/s for funnel flow when the chaff in bulk wheat increased from 0 % to 7. 5 % (weight basis).

Two experimental set-ups with different types of particle flows were investigated using Siemens Somatom Plus type CT equipment. A series of trials were carried out in a small model <b>hopper</b> with flat <b>bottom</b> and almost cylindrical side wall slightly deviating from verticality. Non steady-state flow was studied during the outflow of particulate material from this vessel, through a central hole at the bottom. Further investigation was fulfilled in a modified Cuette-type shearing device to study steady-state shear flow. This equipment consisted of an almost cylindrical vessel identical to that used for gravity flow measurements, and a smaller inner cylinder rotating within this vessel concentrically, around its vertical axis. The surface of the inner cylinder was notched vertically, i. e. perpendicularly to the direction of rotation to increase wall friction between the particles and the cylinder. Almost spherical sucrose granules, also used for gravity flow measurements, were filled into the gap between the rotating cylinder and the outer wall of the equipment. Movement of particles took place due to shear, generated within the particle bed. By using X-ray CT technique, cross-sectional digital images were obtained in every two seconds for both types of particle flows. For this, the cross-sectional variation of the local Hounsfield density values were measured in a matrix of 0. 1 x 0. 1 x 2. 0 mm space elements.

40|$|This work {{examines}} the fundamental behaviour of granular flow in hoppers and blast furnace discharging system. Although extensive researches {{have been carried}} out for many years, most of them are empirical, they are limited by numbers of constraining assumptions, and even the most basic flow mechanisms of granular materials are not well understood. In recent years, the researches of granular flow mechanisms have been developing and improving rapidly worldwide, which benefit from the powerful computer technology and the appearance of discrete particle simulation technique. Discrete element method (DEM) has been used increasingly in particulate research in the past three decades, which can provide micro-dynamic information of particles which is extremely difficult to be obtained by physical experiments. Despite all these contributions, the fundamental mechanism of granular flow still has not been fully understood and the information obtained from experiment and simulation is still scrappy, resulting in lacking of coherence. In this project, the mechanism of granular flow in hopper is studied using DEM simulation, the micro variables are analysed in steady and unsteady flows, such as velocity, force, coordination number and porosity. The micro information generated by DEM simulation is used to analyse the macro dynamics of granular flow by using a proper averaging method. The results show that the distribution of macro variables such as velocity, mass density and stress are highly related to that of micro variables. These analyses should be useful for a more comprehensive understanding of the complex dynamic behaviour of the granular flow. In addition, these analyses are applied to a series of hoppers with different sizes in order to study the size effects on hopper flow. Hopper size relative to particle size indeed has some effects, however, the ratio between particle-packed bed height and hopper length plays an important role. By a proper value, the micro and macro dynamic information can be well obtained from a small hopper. The previous studies on the granular flow in hoppers are mainly focused on the steady flow stage. However, the dynamic behaviour of the granular flow in a hopper in the early stage before the steady state stage is formed, has not been well understood. The start up stage happens {{in a very short time}} period, and is therefore difficult to detect by physical experiments. However, very fewer studies are found related to the start up stage. In this work, the DEM simulation method is applied to study the granular flow in a hopper at the start up stage. The discharge rate, velocity changes and the force propagation are studied, and the outlet size effects are examined. In the start-up stage before a steady state is reached, the discharge rate firstly increases dramatically until its maximum, and then decreases to a constant. After the outlet opening, particles change the state from static to flowing and a curve surface is formed between these two particle states. A force arch on which the particles have very small forces is formed below the switch curve. The switch curve and force arch propagate into the bed with the discharge of particles, and reach the top of the bed when a steady state is achieved. There are no significant effects of outlet sizes on the propagation velocity of the switch curve, however, the vertical force at the switch curve inclines with the increase of the outlet sizes, but decrease with the propagation. The simulation and analyzing methods are then applied to the granular flow in industrial processes. First, the P-W discharge system is selected to study the micro and macro dynamics of granular flow. The results show the different trend with that in a cuboid <b>hopper</b> with flat <b>bottom.</b> Secondly, the discharge rate of granular flow is investigated at different gate openings in the material bins of blast furnace system. The factors which may influence the flow rate are analysed, including rolling friction coefficient, sliding friction coefficient and damping coefficient. The results show that there is a critical gate opening beyond which, further increase in the gate opening will not result in any change of the flow rate. However, this can be solved by changing the location of the material gate to the bin neck area. Lastly, a full model of charging process simulator of blast furnace was developed in this work, which is an important step to decrease the gap between simulation and the real industrial process. Some micro-dynamic variables are analysed during charging process, such as velocity and contact force, a stagnant zone is found in discharge funnel, particles in this area keep stable until all particles are discharged from the material bin. Size segregations of coke and ore particles are studied in each part of the blast furnace. These are not only spatially-distributed but also exist in the discharging process. After filling the material bin, larger particles are more likely to distribute at the side wall with opposite direction of charging particles, smaller particles are more likely concentrate on the other side of the wall. Smaller ore particles discharge slower from discharge funnel through the DCD gate because many are located at stagnant zone...|$|R
