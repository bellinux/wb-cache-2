5|$|Huntington's disease, {{particularly}} {{the application of}} the genetic test for the disease, has raised several ethical issues. The issues for genetic testing include defining how mature an individual should be before being considered eligible for testing, ensuring the confidentiality of results, and whether companies should be allowed to use test results for decisions on employment, life insurance or other financial matters. There was controversy when Charles Davenport proposed in 1910 that compulsory sterilization and <b>immigration</b> <b>control</b> be used for people with certain diseases, including HD, as part of the eugenics movement. In vitro fertilization has some issues regarding its use of embryos. Some HD research has ethical issues due to its use of animal testing and embryonic stem cells.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} motivations and {{underpinnings}} of Irish <b>immigration</b> <b>controls</b> {{in the early}} twentieth century. The broader empirical and theoretical literature suggest that states develop <b>immigration</b> <b>controls</b> for particular domestic needs - the protection of the national population from the intrusion of outsiders. The thesis establishes that the controls introduced in the Irish Free State in 1935 were unusual in that they appear not to have addressed a specific need for to manage immigration to the Free State. They instead replicated other controls previously introduced in the United Kingdom, a state with rather different national circumstances, and from which the Irish Free State had seceded in 1922. The research approach developed for this study is an interdisciplinary methodology of historical sociology. Because of the necessary focus on the roles of structure and agency in the process of shaping Irish <b>immigration</b> <b>controls,</b> realist social theory is adopted as the macro-level social theory used to make historical particulars generalizable. Through a narrative case study method shaped by this methodology, the thesis examines the development of Irish <b>immigration</b> <b>controls.</b> It finds that the interaction between the particular political, economic and cultural contexts of the Irish Free State shaped the process of developing <b>immigration</b> <b>controls.</b> Nationalist politics undoubtedly played a role in their evolution, but in a very different way than suggested by the empirical theoretical literature. <b>Immigration</b> <b>controls</b> are not always about immigration...|$|R

25|$|The CTA {{has meant}} that Ireland has been {{required}} to follow changes in British immigration policy. This was notable in 1962 when Irish law was changed {{in response to the}} Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962, which imposed immigration controls between the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries, while in Ireland the Aliens Order 1962 replaced the state's previous provision exempting all British subjects from <b>immigration</b> <b>control,</b> with one exempting only those born in the United Kingdom. The scope of the Irish provision was much more restrictive than the British legislation as it excluded from <b>immigration</b> <b>control</b> only those British citizens born in the United Kingdom, and imposed immigration controls on those born outside the UK. The latter group would have included individuals who were British citizens by descent or by birth in a British colony. This discrepancy between Britain's and Ireland's definition of a British citizen was not resolved until 1999.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Migration by low-income workers {{limits the}} ability of a country to {{redistribute}} income, since more generous income supplements attract additional workers into the country, reducing wages and raising the cost of the program. This paper studies the role of <b>immigration</b> <b>controls,</b> which allow the government to raise the real incomes of existing immigrants without causing additional <b>immigration.</b> Paradoxically, <b>immigration</b> <b>controls</b> may lead to higher equilibrium levels of immigration in a common labor market, and those low-income individuals left behind in the source countries may be better off. Simply stated, a host country benefits more from immigrants when they are not impoverished, and <b>immigration</b> <b>controls</b> enable the country to eliminate impoverishment. Thus, the country is willing {{to increase the number of}} immigrants that it allows within its borders. After obtaining this insight from the basic model, the paper discusses some extensions and qualification...|$|R
