5000|$|Here, the Q-switch is an {{externally}} {{controlled variable}} attenuator. This {{may be a}} mechanical device such as a shutter, chopper wheel, or spinning mirror/prism placed inside the cavity, or (more commonly) it may be some form of modulator such as an acousto-optic device, a magneto-optic effect device or an <b>electro-optic</b> <b>device</b> — a Pockels cell or Kerr cell. The reduction of losses (increase of Q) is triggered by an external event, typically an electrical signal. The pulse repetition rate can therefore be externally controlled.Modulators generally allow a faster transition from low to high Q, and provide better control. An additional advantage of modulators is that the rejected light may be coupled out of the cavity {{and can be used}} for something else. Alternatively, when the modulator is in its low-Q state, an externally generated beam can be coupled into the cavity through the modulator. This can be used to [...] "seed" [...] the cavity with a beam that has desired characteristics (such as transverse mode or wavelength). When the Q is raised, lasing builds up from the initial seed, producing a Q-switched pulse that has characteristics inherited from the seed.|$|E

We also treat the structure geometry in detail taking account of such effects as the compositional grading across material interfaces. Based on the subband structure, we calculate optical properties of quantum-wire structures. A recuring theme is the cross-over from one- to ~wo-dimensional behavior in these structures. This complicated behavior procludes the application of simple theoretical models to obtain the electronic structure.

40|$|The still undiscovered fluid {{ferroelectric}} {{nematic phase}} {{is expected to}} exhibit a much faster and easier response to an external electric field compared to conventional ferroelectric smectic liquid crystals; therefore, the discovery of such a phase could open new avenues in <b>electro-optic</b> <b>device</b> technology. Here, experimental evidence of a ferroelectric response to a switching electric field in a low molar mass nematic liquid crystal is reported and connected with field-induced biaxiality. The fluid is made of bent-core polar molecules and is nematic over a range of 120 degrees C. Combining repolarization current measurements, electro-optical characterizations, X-ray diffraction and computer simulations, ferroelectric switching is demonstrated and it is concluded that the response is due to field-induced reorganization of polar cybotactic groups within the nematic phase.

40|$|Abstract. An {{uncooled}} SiC-based <b>electro-optic</b> <b>device</b> {{is developed}} for gas sensing applications. P-type dopants Ga, Sc, P and Al {{are incorporated into}} an n-type crystalline 6 H-SiC substrate by a laser doping technique for sensing CO 2, CO, NO 2 and NO gases, respectively. Each dopant creates an acceptor energy level within the bandgap of the substrate so that the energy gap between this acceptor level and the valence band matches the quantum of energy emitted by the gas of interest. The photons of the gas excite electrons from the valence band to the acceptor level, which alters the electron density in these two states. Consequently, the refractive index of the substrate changes, which, in turn, modifies the reflectivity of the substrate. This change in reflectivity represents the optical signal of the sensor, which is probed remotely with a laser such as a helium-neon laser. Although the midwave infrared (3 - 5 µm) band is studied in this paper, the approach is applicable to other spectral bands...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{widespread}} use of solution-processable hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites in photovoltaic and light-emitting applications, determination of their intrinsic charge transport parameters has been elusive due to the variability of film preparation and history-dependent device performance. Here we show that screening effects associated to ionic transport can be effectively eliminated by lowering the operating temperature of methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3) field-effect transistors (FETs). Field-effect carrier mobility is found to increase by almost two orders of magnitude below 200 K, consistent with phonon scattering limited transport. Under balanced ambipolar carrier injection, gate-dependent electroluminescence is also observed from the transistor channel, with spectra revealing the tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition. This first demonstration of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 light-emitting FETs provides intrinsic transport parameters to guide materials and solar cell optimization, and will drive the development of new <b>electro-optic</b> <b>device</b> concepts, such as gated light emitting diodes and lasers operating at room temperature...|$|E
