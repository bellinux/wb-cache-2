40|$|An {{experimental}} study into {{the effects of}} changes in such physical design parameters as hollow cathode position, anode position and ring cusp magnetic field configuration and strength on <b>discharge</b> <b>chamber</b> performance, is described. The results are presented in terms of comparative plasma ion energy cost, extracted ion fraction and ion beam profile data. Such comparisons are used to demonstrate specific means by which changes in these design parameters induce changes in performance, i. e., through changes in the loss rates of primary electrons to the anode, of ions to <b>discharge</b> <b>chamber</b> walls or of ions to cathode and anode surfaces. Results show: (1) the rate of primary electron loss to the anode decreases as the anode is moved downstream of the ring cusp toward the screen grid, (2) the loss rate of ions to hollow cathode surfaces are excessive if the cathode is located upstream of a point of peak magnetic flux density on the <b>discharge</b> <b>chamber</b> centerline, and (3) the fraction of the ions produced that are lost to <b>discharge</b> <b>chamber</b> walls and ring magnet surfaces is reduced by positioning the magnet rings so the plasma density is uniform over the grid surface {{and so there are}} no steep magnetic flux density gradients near the walls through which ions can be lost by Bohm diffusion. The uniformity of the plasma density at the grids can also be improved by moving the point of primary electron injection into the <b>discharge</b> <b>chamber</b> off of the chamber centerline.
