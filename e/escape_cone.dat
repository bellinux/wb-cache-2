This mirror enhances the voltage of the solar cell by providing internally luminescent photons with multiple opportunities for escaping out the front sur-face. Likewise, intermediate reflectors in a multibandgap solar cell can assist external luminescence to enhance the voltage for each cell in a stack. These intermediate reflectors must also transmit the subbandgap photons to the next cell in the stack. A practi-cal implementation of an intermediate selective reflector is an air gap sandwiched by antireflection coatings.

In a pcW-LED, the blue die will be covered by phosphor mixed with the encapsulation material such as silicone [20]. The blue light in the packaging is different from that emitted by a bare blue die to the air since the light extraction of the blue die changes. Generally, the LEE could increase in such a condition, because the light <b>escaping</b> <b>cone</b> in the blue die becomes larger owing to the increase of the refractive index outside the die. However, it could be possible to reduce the LEE if the major LEE comes from effective surface texture [15]-[18]. Eventually, it is difficult to measure the power of the blue light inside the packaging volume directly. To solve the problem, we propose a way with measuring the power of the bare blue die and a calibration factor to calculate the power of the blue light inside the packaging volume.

After convolving with the luminosity function of OB associations, we show that the ionizing photons <b>escape</b> within a <b>cone</b> of similar to 40 degrees, consistent with observations of nearby galaxies. The evolution of the escape fraction with time shows that it falls initially as cold gas is accumulated in a dense shell. After the shell crosses a few scaleheights and fragments, the escape fraction through the polar regions rises again. The angle-averaged escape fraction cannot exceed similar to 1 - cos (1 rad) ] = 0. 5 from geometrical considerations (using the emission cone opening angle). We calculate the dependence of the time-and angle-averaged escape fraction on the mid-plane disc gas density (in the range n(0) = 0. 15 - 50 cm(- 3)) and the disc scaleheight (between z(0) = 10 and 600 pc).
