40|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>process</b> route {{selection}} {{is one of}} the main design decisions that needs to be taken during the preliminary stages of chemical plant design and development. A <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> route is considered as the raw materials and the sequence of reaction steps that converts them in to desired products. Previously, the most important factor considered in selecting the <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> route was plant economics. However, now other issues such as safety, environment and occupational health have also become important considerations. Therefore, at early stages of <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> plant design and development it is necessary to apply methodologies to identify and assess environmental, occupational health and safety hazards involved in the process routes. This work proposes a methodology for assessing <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> routes to manufacture a chemical based on inherent environmental, occupational health and safety hazards. The method developed in this work can be used during early design stages of a <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> plant. The process {{route selection}} is done based on impacts due to emissions from the ongoing operational conditions of the plant. It considers the potential toxicological impacts on the environment, potential impacts on the occupational health due to fugitive emissions and the potential <b>chemical</b> and <b>process</b> safety impacts within the plant. As the outcome of the methodology, an integrated index called “Inherent <b>Chemical</b> <b>Process</b> Route Index” (ICPRI) is proposed which can be used for the selection of the ‘best’ <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> route for a <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> plant, based on inherent environmental hazard, occupational health and safety (IEHS). The lower the ICPRI the more inherently environmentally friendly, inherently occupational healthier and inherently safer the route is. The methodology developed in this work can also rank alternative <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> routes based on inherent environmental hazard or occupational health hazard and or safety hazard separately. The method was applied on four possible process routes to produce acetone. The propene oxidation route showed the lowest ICPRI value indicating potentially the ‘best’ <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> route for acetone manufacturing process based on the IEHS assessment.

40|$|This report {{acts as a}} beginner’s {{guide to}} <b>chemical</b> <b>processes</b> {{optimization}}. Performed universally, optimization merely entails improving an existing process, situation, device or system. For a chemical engineer, optimization typically aims to maximize potential economics of a <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> by manipulating decision variables while staying within known constraints. In order to maximize the overall economics of a <b>chemical</b> <b>process,</b> individual equipment or stream conditions are examined. The <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> is implemented in simulation software The optimization of individual components of the process may aim to maximize or minimize an outcome specific to that component, but still ultimately maximizes economic potential. An engineer must determine how each component of the process ultimately impacts the overall economic potential. Upon initial analysis of a <b>chemical</b> <b>process,</b> optimization can seem overwhelming. This report first defines, explains and exemplifies all the nomenclature used to develop, solve and evaluate optimization. This is follow by identification {{and analysis of the}} two types of optimization. This knowledge allows for final development of a generalized approach to <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> optimization, including a specific and complete optimization example.

40|$|In {{response}} to societal concerns about major disasters in the <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> industries, <b>chemical</b> engineering departments have been attempting to incorporate <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> safety into their curricula. Pressure is also coming from ABET; the AIChE Program Criteria in EC 2000 require a {{working knowledge of}} the safety aspects of <b>chemical</b> <b>processes.</b> There are three ways of incorporating <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> safety into the chemical engineering curriculum: (1) a course or courses devoted to process safety, (2) integration of <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> safety into existing courses and (3) {{a combination of the}} two approaches. Having a separate course in <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> safety puts process safety in a prominent position in the curriculum, forces the students to focus on process safety, and is the best way to deal with certain safety topics such as toxicology, industrial hygiene, dispersion models and design of relief systems. However, the students may compartmentalize safety and treat it as a topic separate from their other chemical engineering activities. Furthermore, the students may not experience a “hands-on ” exposure to process safety. Finally, many chemical engineering departments do not have extra credits available in their curricula to permit a separate course in <b>process</b> safety. Integrating <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> safety into existing chemical engineering courses has the advantage of exposing the students to <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> safety “in context”. The unit operations laboratory and the process design courses are ideal settings for integration of process safety. The instructional materials developed by SACHE make it possible to spread aspects of <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> safety throughout the entire chemical engineering curriculum. The biggest difficulty with this approach is getting all the chemical engineering faculty to follow through with the implementation...|$|R

50|$|In a {{biological}} context chlorine behaves similarly to other {{atoms in the}} <b>halogen</b> <b>chemical</b> series, and thus reductive dechlorination can be considered to fall within a somewhat broader class of biological reactions known as reductive dehalogenation reactions, in which the removal of a halogen substituent from an organic molecule occurs with a simultaneous addition of electrons to the molecule. This can be further subdivided into two types of reaction processes, the first of which, hydrogenolysis, is {{the replacement of the}} halogen atom with a hydrogen atom. The second, vicinal reduction (sometimes called, dihaloelimination), involves the removal of two halogen atoms that are adjacent on the same alkane or alkene molecule, leading to the formation of an additional carbon-carbon bond.|$|R
