40|$|Snakes {{often occur}} in species-rich assemblages, and sympatry {{is thought to}} be {{facilitated}} primarily by low diet overlap, not interspecific interactions. We selected, a priori, three species pairs consisting of species that are morphologically and taxonomically similar and may therefore be likely to engage in interspecific, consumptive competition. We then examined a large-scale database of snake detection/nondetection data and used occupancy modelling to determine whether these species occur together more or less frequently than expected by chance while accounting for variation in detection probability among species and incorporating important habitat categories in the models. For some snakes, we obtained evidence that the probabilities that habitat patches are used are influenced by the presence of potentially competing congeneric species. Specifically, timber rattlesnakes (Crotalus horridus) were less likely than expected by chance to use areas that also contained <b>eastern</b> <b>diamond-backed</b> <b>rattlesnakes</b> (Crotalus adamanteus) when the proportion of evergreen forest was relatively high. Otherwise, they occurred together more often than expected by chance. Complex relationships were revealed between habitat use, detection probabilities and occupancy probabilities of North American racers (Coluber constrictor) and coachwhips (Coluber flagellum) that indicated the probability of competitive exclusion increased with increasing area of grassland habitat, although there was some model uncertainty. Cornsnakes (Pantherophis guttatus or Pantherophis slowinskii) and ratsnakes (Pantherophis alleghaniensis, Pantherophis spiloides, or Pantherophis obsoletus) exhibited differences in habitat selection, but we obtained no evidence that patterns of use for this species pair were influenced by current interspecific interactions. Overall, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that competitive interactions influence snake assemblage composition; the strength of these effects was affected by landscape-scale habitat features. Furthermore, we suggest that current interspecific interactions may influence snake occupancy, challenging the paradigm that contemporary patterns of snake co-occurrence are largely a function of diet partitioning that arose over evolutionary time...|$|R

40|$|We {{conducted}} an experiment {{to examine the}} effects of sex and food intake on growth, mass gain, and attainment of sexual maturity in Western <b>Diamond‐backed</b> <b>Rattlesnakes</b> (Crotalus atrox). We also measured testosterone levels to determine whether testosterone might be involved in the male‐biased sexual size dimorphism observed in this species. We collected neonate rattlesnakes and raised them in the laboratory for 2 years on either a high‐intake diet (fed one mouse per week) or a low‐intake diet (fed one mouse every 3 weeks). High‐intake snakes grew and gained mass more rapidly than low‐intake snakes, but males did not grow or gain mass more rapidly than females in either treatment group. High‐intake snakes attained reproductive maturity earlier than low‐intake snakes, indicating that size, not age, is the critical determinant of reproductive maturity. Males had higher levels of testosterone than females but did not grow more quickly, suggesting that testosterone may not affect growth in this species and may therefore not be the proximate determinant of sexual size dimorphism...|$|R
40|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} in size (sexual size dimorphism; SSD) {{is nearly}} ubiquitous, but {{the relative importance}} of genetic versus environmental control of SSD is not known for most species. We investigated proximate determinants of SSD in several species of squamate reptiles, including three species of Sceloporus lizards and the <b>diamond‐backed</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> (Crotalus atrox). In natural populations of these species, SSD is caused by sexual differences in age‐specific growth. Males and females, however, may often share similar potentials for growth: growth is strongly responsive to the availability of food, and sexual differences in growth can be greatly suppressed or completely absent under common environmental conditions in the laboratory. Sexually divergent growth is expressed in natural environments because of inherent ecological differences between males and females and because of potential epigenetic effects of sex‐specific growth regulators. In field‐active Sceloporus, sexual differences in growth rate are associated with sexual divergence in plasma testosterone. Experiments confirm that testosterone inhibits growth in species in which females are larger (fo...|$|R
40|$|Accurately {{assessing}} free-ranging animals’ {{patterns of}} surface activity and refuge use is critical, yet fundamentally challenging for biologists and wildlife managers. We evaluate {{the accuracy of}} an automated technique—temperature-based activity estimation (TBAE) —in estimating surface activity and refuge use patterns of two sympatric reptiles, the western <b>diamond-backed</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> (Crotalus atrox) and the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) in the Sonoran Desert. TBAE derived from a comparison of body temperature to shaded air temperature was effective in estimating the overall percent surface activity for both rattlesnakes (observed surface activity 51. 8 %, TBAE estimated surface activity 48. 2 %) and Gila monsters (observed 22. 3 %, TBAE 24. 5 %). There was, however, considerable interspecific difference in the effectiveness of TBAE in predicting surface activity at specific time points; TBAE was far more accurate for Gila monsters than for rattlesnakes (96 % vs. 66 % time point-specific accuracy, respectively). We assert that, when validated, TBAE {{can be used to}} yield concurrent and accurate body temperatures and activity estimates for multiple free-ranging animals, particularly in arid environments, which improves our understanding of animal biology and can be used to inform management decisions...|$|R
40|$|We report {{seasonal}} variation in steroid hormone levels in blood samples from free-ranging Western <b>Diamond-backed</b> <b>Rattlesnakes</b> (Crotalus atrox), {{and the relationship}} between these hormones and events in the reproductive cycle. At a field site in the Sonoran Desert of south-central Arizona, we collected monthly blood samples over the course of two active seasons from 17 radiotelemetered females, and over three active seasons from 103 randomly encountered males. We used radioimmunoassay to measure plasma levels of 17 β-estradiol, progesterone, corticosterone, and testosterone in samples from females, and corticosterone and testosterone in samples from males. Non-reproductive females have consistently low levels of circulating 17 β-estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone throughout the year. In reproductive females, 17 β-estradiol levels increase dramatically and testosterone levels increase modestly during vitellogenesis in April and May, while progesterone levels increase dramatically at ovulation in June and then steadily decline until parturition in August. Corticosterone levels appear relatively constant in non-reproductive females, whereas reproductive females show increased levels at the end of gestation. Plasma testosterone levels in males are low in early summer and are elevated during spring and late summer, corresponding to the two mating periods of C. atrox. Plasma corticosterone levels in males did not vary seasonally and were not related to testosterone levels...|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{studies of}} {{individual}} animals in nature contribute disproportionately {{to our understanding}} of the principles of ecology and evolution. Such field studies can benefit greatly from integrating the methods of molecular genetics with traditional approaches. Even though molecular genetic tools are particularly valuable for species that are difficult to observe directly, they have not been widely adopted. Here, we used molecular genetic techniques in a 10 -year radio-telemetric investigation of the western <b>diamond-backed</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> (Crotalus atrox) for an analysis of its mating system and to measure sexual selection. Specifically, we used microsatellite markers to genotype 299 individuals, including neonates from litters of focal females to ascertain parentage using full-pedigree likelihood methods. We detected high levels of multiple paternity within litters, yet found little concordance between paternity and observations of courtship and mating behavior. Larger males did not father significantly more offspring, but we found evidence for size-specific male-mating strategies, with larger males guarding females for longer periods in the mating seasons. Moreover, the spatial proximity of males to mothers was significantly associated with reproductive success. Overall, our field observations alone would have been insufficient to quantitatively measure the mating system of this population of C. atrox, and we thus urge more widesprea...|$|R
40|$|Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge {{is located}} in central New Mexico in the Chihuahuan desert. Approximately 25 % of the refuge spans the Rio Grande {{floodplain}} and consists of managed riparian and agriculture areas. The upland areas are dominated by creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), honey mesquite (Prosopis sp.), and four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens). Western <b>diamond-backed</b> <b>rattlesnakes</b> (Crotalus atrox) are habitat generalists of dry lowland areas and commonly use dry washes, Larrea and Prosopis desert, rocky slopes, scrub/grassland, man-made structures, and less commonly hydric habitats. A high diversity of vegetation types span the refuge and hydric and upland habitats are often in close proximity. To determine if C. atrox are found uniformly across the refuge and within their home ranges {{as well as what}} habitats are preferred and avoided, we investigate habitat preference at two spatial scales, landscape and home range. We used initial snake captures and search effort data for the landscape and radio-telemetry data for the home range analysis. We found that snakes use habitats non-uniformly at both spatial scales. While snakes at the landscape scale were found more than expected in Riparian habitat, a variety of habitats were preferred and avoided at the home range level. Apparent selection and avoidance was found when grouping telemetered individuals, although, it was not significant. Individual variation within home ranges varied so dramatically that significant average preference or avoidance in certain habitats could not be determined for the telemetered group as a whole. Among individual home ranges, some habitats were preferred by some and avoided by others. BiologyMastersUniversity of New Mexico. Biology Dept. Snell, HowardToolson, EricCoonrod, Juli...|$|R
40|$|Food {{availability}} is {{an important}} factor in the life histories of organisms because it is often limiting and thus can affect growth, mass change, reproduction, and behaviors such as thermoregulation, locomotion, and mating. Experimental studies in natural settings allow researchers to examine the effects of food on these parameters while animals are free to behave naturally. The wide variation among organisms in energy demands and among environmental food resources suggest that responses to changes in food availability may vary among organisms. Since most supplemental feeding field experiments have been conducted on species with high energy demands, we conducted a supplemental feeding study on free‐ranging, female Western <b>diamond‐backed</b> <b>rattlesnakes</b> (Crotalus atrox), a species with low energy demands and infrequent reproductive investment. Snakes were offered thawed rodents 1 ‐ 4 times per week. Over two active seasons, we collected data on surface activity, home range size, growth, mass change, and reproduction of supplementally fed and control snakes. Fed and control snakes did not differ in surface activity levels (proportion of time encountered above versus below ground) or home range size. Fed snakes grew and gained mass faster, and had a dramatically higher occurrence of reproduction than control snakes. Also, fed snakes were in better body condition following reproduction than snakes that were not fed. However, litter characteristics such as offspring number and size were not increased by feeding, suggesting that these characteristics may be fixed. These data experimentally demonstrate that food availability can directly impact some life history traits (i. e., growth and reproduction for C. atrox), but not others (i. e., surface activity and home range size for C. atrox). The relationship between food availability and life history traits is affected in a complex way by ecological traits and physiological constraints, and thus interspecific variation in this relationship is likely to be high...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{field studies}} on the {{reproductive}} ecology of western <b>diamond-backed</b> <b>rattlesnakes</b> (Crotalus atrox) from populations in southern Arizona showed {{significant differences in the}} concentration of plasma sex steroids (testosterone, T; 5 α-dihydrotestosterone, DHT; and 17 β-estradiol, E 2) throughout the active season (March–October), and peak levels were coincident with the two mating periods (late summer and early spring). There is, however, no information on levels of sex steroids during winter. Similar to most snakes, hibernating individuals of C. atrox are typically inaccessible, but in southern Arizona, where environmental conditions are typically mild during winter, adult males frequently bask at or near the entrances of communal dens. Basking activity, therefore, offers a unique logistical opportunity to assess the complete annual profile of plasma sex steroid levels in males of a temperate reptile in nature. From November to February, we measured levels of plasma T, DHT, and E 2 in adult male C. atrox that were located basking at communal dens. Additionally, cloacal, core body, and ambient air temperatures were obtained to investigate potential relationships between body temperatures and levels of sex steroids. Mean levels of T, DHT, and E 2 were relatively high, and the concentration hierarchy was T 3 ̆e DHT 3 ̆e E 2. Mean levels of T, DHT, and E 2 showed no significant variation across the four months of sampling; however, E 2 levels decreased progressively. In the annul cycle, sex steroid levels during winter were not basal when compared to values obtained during the active season. Mean cloacal temperatures of basking males were significantly higher than core body temperatures of non-basking males (inside dens) from November–December, and in February, which suggests that one function of winter basking is to elevate body temperatures. Steroid levels, nonetheless, were not significantly correlated with cloacal temperatures. We suggest that future field studies of male C. atrox should: (a) investigate sex steroid levels in non-basking individuals and (b) test whether elevated levels of sex steroids during winter facilitate the large increases that occur in early spring, which are coincident with the second mating season. Our findings on the reproductive biology of C. atrox and other viperids are discussed {{in the context of the}} associated–dissociated model of reproduction...|$|R

We investigated proximate determinants of SSD in several species of squamate reptiles, including three species of Sceloporus lizards and the <b>diamond‐backed</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> (Crotalus atrox). In natural populations of these species, SSD is caused by sexual differences in age‐specific growth. Males and females, however, may often share similar potentials for growth: growth is strongly responsive to the availability of food, and sexual differences in growth can be greatly suppressed or completely absent under common environmental conditions in the laboratory. Sexually divergent growth is expressed in natural environments because of inherent ecological differences between males and females and because of potential epigenetic effects of sex‐specific growth regulators. In field‐active Sceloporus, sexual differences in growth rate are associated with sexual divergence in plasma testosterone. Experiments confirm that testosterone inhibits growth in species in which females are larger (for example, S. undulatus and S. virgatus) and stimulates growth in those in which males are larger (for example, S. jarrovii). Interestingly, however, sexual divergence in plasma testosterone is not accompanied by divergence in growth in S. jarrovii or in male‐larger C. atrox in the laboratory. Furthermore, experimental effects of castration and testosterone replacement on growth are not evident in captive S. jarrovii, possibly because growth effects of testosterone are superseded by an abundant, high‐quality diet. In female‐larger S. undulatus, growth may be traded‐off against testosterone‐induced reproductive costs of activity. In male‐larger species, costs of reproduction in terms of growth are suggested by supplemental feeding of reproductive female C. atrox in their natural environment and by experimental manipulation of reproductive cost in female S. jarrovii. Growth costs of reproduction, however, do not contribute substantially to the development of SSD in male‐larger S. jarrovii. We conclude that the energetic costs of testosterone‐induced, male reproductive behavior may contribute substantially to the development of SSD in some female‐larger species. However, despite strong evidence that reproductive investment exacts a substantial cost in growth, we do not support the reproductive cost hypothesis as a general explanation of SSD in male‐larger species...|$|R
