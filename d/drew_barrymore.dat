5|$|The filmmakers {{retained}} {{the names of}} most of the case's real-life protagonists, but the names of several supporting characters were altered.

Peirce scouted the LGBT community, looking mainly for masculine, lesbian women for the role of Brandon Teena. Peirce said the LGBT community was very interested in the project because of the publicity surrounding the murder. High-profile actors avoided Peirce's auditions at the request of their agents because of the stigma associated with the role.|$|E
5|$|In June 1982, the Steven Spielberg–directed {{science fiction}} film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial was {{released}} to cinemas.

5|$|Lionel Barrymore (born Lionel Herbert Blythe; 1878–1954) was an American actor of stage, {{screen and}} radio. He also {{directed}} several films, wrote scripts, created etchings, sketches and composed music. He was the eldest {{child of the}} actors Maurice Barrymore and Georgie <b>Drew</b> <b>Barrymore,</b> and his two siblings were John and Ethel; these {{and other family members}} were part of an acting dynasty. Reluctant to follow his parents' career, Barrymore appeared together with his grandmother Louisa Lane Drew in a stage production of The Rivals at the age of 15. He soon found success on stage in character roles. Although he took a break from acting in 1906–09 to train in Paris as a painter, he was not successful as an artist and returned to the US and acting. He also joined his family troupe, from 1910, in their vaudeville act.|$|E
5|$|Having {{worked with}} Cary Guffey on Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Spielberg felt {{confident}} {{in working with}} a cast composed mostly of child actors. For the role of Elliott, he auditioned hundreds of boys before Jack Fisk suggested Henry Thomas for the role because Henry had played the part of Harry in the movie Raggedy Man which Jack Fisk had directed. Thomas, who auditioned in an Indiana Jones costume, did not perform well in the formal testing, but got the filmmakers' attention in an improvised scene. Thoughts of his dead dog inspired his convincing tears. Robert MacNaughton auditioned eight times to play Michael, sometimes with boys auditioning for Elliott. Spielberg felt <b>Drew</b> <b>Barrymore</b> had the right imagination for mischievous Gertie after she impressed him with a story that she led a punk rock band. He enjoyed working with the children, and he later said that the experience made him feel ready to be a father.|$|E
