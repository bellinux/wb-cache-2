5|$|Djokovic and Nadal {{have the}} most {{head-to-head}} meetings in Open Era history with 50 meetings, which Djokovic leads 26–24. Nadal leads on grass 2–1 and clay 15–7, while Djokovic leads on hard courts 18–7. They have met 13 times in Grand Slam tournaments with Nadal leading 9–4, and 4–3 in finals. The rivalry is listed as the third greatest rivalry in the 2000s decade by ATPworldtour.com and is widely {{considered to be the}} greatest rivalry {{in the history of the}} sport. Djokovic is the first player to have at least ten match wins against Nadal and the only person to defeat Nadal seven times consecutively, which he did twice. He is also only the second player to have defeated Nadal in more than one Grand Slam tournament final (the other being Federer) and the first to beat Nadal in a final on a surface other than grass. Their 2012 Australian Open encounter is considered by many to be the greatest match <b>ever</b> <b>played</b> and their 2013 French Open semifinal is considered the best clay court match <b>ever</b> <b>played.</b>|$|E

5|$|Leek {{were chosen}} {{to be among the}} founder members of the new Northern Premier League Division One in 1987 and in 1989–90 won the Division One title to gain {{promotion}} to the Premier Division, the highest level at which they had <b>ever</b> <b>played.</b> In the same season they progressed through eight rounds of the FA Trophy, including a quarter-final win over Darlington, that season's Conference champions, to reach the final at Wembley Stadium but were defeated 3–0 by Barrow.|$|E

5|$|On 7 April 1945, Millwall {{appeared}} in a Football League War Cup final at Wembley Stadium against Chelsea, {{but because it was}} a wartime cup final it is not acknowledged in the record books. With the war in Europe in its last days, the number of spectators allowed to attend games was relaxed. The attendance was 90,000, the largest crowd Millwall have <b>ever</b> <b>played</b> in front of, which included King George VI, whom the team were introduced to before kick-off.|$|E
5|$|Only one List A {{game was}} <b>ever</b> <b>played</b> at the ground, {{and this was}} only the second match of its type: Glamorgan's Gillette Cup fixture against Somerset on 22 May1963. Except for the {{aforementioned}} 1910 game, the only first-class match not to involve Glamorgan was a Test Trial in July 1932, which was badly affected by the weather and saw play on {{only one of the}} scheduled three days.|$|E
5|$|Since {{there were}} no {{qualifying}} games, the opening two matches of the tournament were the first World Cup games <b>ever</b> <b>played,</b> taking place simultaneously on 13 July 1930; France beat Mexico 4–1 at the Estadio Pocitos, while the United States defeated Belgium 3–0 {{at the same time}} at the Estadio Gran Parque Central.

5|$|The 1939–40 {{season was}} Bradman's most {{productive}} ever for SA: 1,448runs {{at an average}} of 144.8. He made three double centuries, including 251 not out against NSW, the innings that he rated the best he <b>ever</b> <b>played</b> in the Sheffield Shield, as he tamed Bill O'Reilly {{at the height of his}} form. However, it was the end of an era. The outbreak of World War Two led to the indefinite postponement of all cricket tours, and the suspension of the Sheffield Shield competition.|$|E
5|$|The Kids Are Alright {{was also}} {{completed}} in 1979. It was a retrospective of the band's career, directed by Jeff Stein. The film included {{footage of the}} band at Monterey, Woodstock and Pontiac, and clips from the Smothers Brothers' show and Russell Harty Plus. Moon had died one week after seeing the rough cut with Daltrey. The film contains the Shepperton concert, and an audio track of him playing over silent footage of himself {{was the last time}} he <b>ever</b> <b>played</b> the drums.|$|E
5|$|At the 1999 Women's World Cup in the United States, the German {{team also}} failed to qualify directly, but managed to beat the Ukraine in a {{qualifying}} play-off. Germany started their World Cup campaign by drawing with Italy and winning 6–0 over Mexico. In the last group game, Germany drew 3–3 against Brazil; by conceding a last minute equalizer, Germany failed to win the group and subsequently {{had to face the}} hosts in the quarter-final. With 54,642 people in attendance, among them U.S. President Bill Clinton, the crowd at the Jack Kent Cooke Stadium was the biggest the German team had <b>ever</b> <b>played</b> in front of. Despite leading twice, they lost 2–3 to the eventual World Cup winners.|$|E

5|$|Carrigan {{retired as}} player and manager after 1916, {{returning}} to his native Maine to be a businessman. Ruth, who played under four managers {{who are in the}} National Baseball Hall of Fame, always maintained that Carrigan, who is not enshrined there, was the best skipper he <b>ever</b> <b>played</b> for. There were other changes in the Red Sox organization that offseason, as Lannin sold the team to a three-man group headed by New York theatrical promoter Harry Frazee. Jack Barry was hired by Frazee as manager.|$|E
5|$|During the 1998–99 season, All-Star guard Eddie Jones {{and center}} Elden Campbell were {{traded to the}} Charlotte Hornets. The team also {{acquired}} J. R. Reid, B. J. Armstrong, and Glen Rice. Head coach Del Harris was fired in February after a three-game losing streak and replaced on an interim basis by former Laker Kurt Rambis. The team finished 31–19 in the strike-shortened season, which was fourth in the Western Conference. The Lakers defeated Houston {{in the first round}} of the playoffs, but were swept by San Antonio in the next round. Game four of the series would be the last game <b>ever</b> <b>played</b> at the Great Western Forum.|$|E
5|$|For the 1958 season, the {{durations}} of timeouts {{was extended}} from 60 to 90 seconds and Bell mandated officials call a few TV timeouts during each game — a change which triggered criticism from sportswriters. The 1958 championship game {{became the first}} NFL championship game decided in overtime and it {{was considered to be}} the greatest football game <b>ever</b> <b>played.</b> The game further increased football's marketability to television advertising, and the drama associated with overtime was the catalyst. Years later, after witnessing Bell openly crying after the game, Raymond Berry attributed it to Bell's realization of the impact the game would have on the prevalence of the sport.|$|E
