5|$|Supporters of the {{original}} doctrine of privity {{say that it is}} reasonable not to allow third parties to enforce contracts, arguing that to allow them to do so would hamper the rights of {{the original}} parties in relation to amending or terminating contracts. Another argument put forward is that the doctrine was deliberately retained by judges to protect consumers from exclusion clauses designed to protect third party manufacturers from liability. The <b>general</b> <b>view</b> of academics, however, is that no legal argument has yet been advanced as to why the original doctrine should be good law. Patrick Atiyah argues that the doctrine came from a time of rising trade through middlemen, and was designed to simplify commercial transactions and encourage enterprise liability.|$|E

25|$|The Conservative Rabbinical Assembly's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards (CJLS), {{consistent}} with the Conservative movement's <b>general</b> <b>view</b> {{of the role of}} kohanim, has ruled that the practice of calling a kohen to the first aliyah represents a custom rather than a law, and that accordingly, a Conservative rabbi is not obligated to follow it. As such, in some Conservative synagogues, this practice is not followed.|$|E
25|$|State run {{enterprises}} in socialist countries {{had little or}} no interest in producing what customers wanted which resulted in shortages of goods and services. In the early 1990s, the <b>general</b> <b>view</b> was that there was no precedent for moving from socialism to capitalism", and only some elderly people remembered how a market economy worked. As result the view that Central, Southeastern and Eastern Europe would stay poor for decades was common.|$|E
25|$|The work failed: {{it is the}} <b>general</b> <b>view</b> that Milton's work did not succeed, {{at least}} in terms of rebutting the Eikon Basilike. On the other hand, {{scholars}} still debate exactly what the polemic intention of Milton's work was. This book was the first work by Milton to be at all widely read. Public sentiment still supported Charles I, but the tract was able to appeal to a larger audience than many of Milton's previous works.|$|E

25|$|From 1858 to 1861, Stephen {{served as}} {{secretary}} to a Royal Commission on popular education, whose conclusions were promptly put into effect.

In 1863 he published his <b>General</b> <b>View</b> of the Criminal Law of England, the first attempt made since William Blackstone to explain the principles of English law and justice in a literary form, and it enjoyed considerable success. The foundation of the Pall Mall Gazette in 1865 gave Stephen a new literary avenue. He continued to contribute until he became a judge.|$|E
25|$|The La Tène {{culture is}} {{traditionally}} {{associated with the}} Celts, and the <b>general</b> <b>view</b> until fairly recently was that the appearance of this culture indicated a large-scale invasion by peoples who also brought a Celtic language which later developed into Welsh. The currently more popular view is that any movement of peoples was on a smaller scale, with cultural diffusion {{responsible for most of}} the changes. There is some evidence to support the latter model, such as burials associated with earlier religious sites. It has been suggested that a Celtic language was being spoken in Wales by about 700 BC.|$|E

25|$|Other {{figures that}} {{significantly}} impacted {{the style of}} Sakate’s works were European playwrights Anton Chekhov and Henrik Ibsen. Sakate has adapted and translated several of Chekhov's works into the nō style, thus creating his contemporary nō series. In 2010, these adapted plays were collected into The Contemporary Nō Collection (現代能楽集 Gendai nōgakushū). Although Chekhov and Ibsen {{were not part of}} the nō style, Sakate took these works and created them to fit the <b>general</b> <b>view</b> of nō and also making unique adaptations to create his own style. Plays of Chekhov he translated include The Seagull, Uncle Vanya, The Cherry Orchard, and Three Sisters.|$|E
25|$|Mary, {{the wife}} of Clopas, is named only once in the New Testament, in , where she is listed as one of four women {{standing}} by the Cross, the others being Mary the mother of Jesus, her sister (or perhaps cousin, the Aramaic words being the same), and Mary Magdalene. An alternative reading is that the list is of only three women, and that Mary of Clopas is also the sister (or cousin) of Mary the mother of Jesus, as some traditions maintain. The passage could also be interpreted to mean that Mary of Clopas is Clopas' daughter, rather than his wife, {{but this is not}} the <b>general</b> <b>view.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{letters of}} Alfred Newton include one {{to his brother}} giving an {{eye-witness}} account of the debate, and written {{less than a month}} afterwards. Other eyewitnesses, with one or two exceptions (Hooker especially thought he had made the best points), give similar accounts, at varying dates after the event. The <b>general</b> <b>view</b> was and still is that Huxley got much the better of the exchange though Wilberforce himself thought he had done quite well. In the absence of a verbatim report differing perceptions are difficult to judge fairly; Huxley wrote a detailed account for Darwin, a letter which does not survive; however, a letter to his friend Frederick Daniel Dyster does survive with an account just three months after the event.|$|E
