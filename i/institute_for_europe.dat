5000|$|The European very-long-baseline {{interferometry}} (VLBI) Network {{was formed}} in 1980 by a consortium of five of the major radio astronomy institutes in Europe (the European Consortium for VLBI). Since 1980, the EVN and the Consortium has grown to include 9 institutes with 12 radio telescopes in 8 western European countries as well as associated institutes with telescopes in Italy, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, China and South Africa.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to clarify the process of {{establishing}} the Sendai Educational Research Institute,which was a vanguard <b>for</b> other local <b>Institutes</b> <b>for</b> Educational Research in Japan, and its activitiesin the first year. One of the characteristics of local <b>Institutes</b> <b>for</b> Educational Research is to conduct basic and scientificresearches that would become the basis in educational planing according to actual conditions inthe region. Previous studies have revealed that Local <b>Institutes</b> <b>for</b> Educational Research in Japan werefounded under the educational policy reform that placed a high value on decentralization of authorityafter the World War II. However, the Sendai Educational Research Institute had been continuouslyconducting scientific studies in response to the actual condition of children and their communities inSendai, and giving practical trainings to teachers based on the results of the studies even in the prewartimewhen the educational policy was severely controlled by the state. Moreover, <b>Institutes</b> <b>for</b> Educational Research in pre-war time were generally considered as the organizationswhich centered on medical diagnoses and clinical consultation for children. On the otherhand, the Sendai Educational Research Institute, which modeled after <b>Institutes</b> <b>for</b> Educational Researchin <b>Europe</b> and America, aimed to collect basic data in order to improve school education and todevise new educational methods based on them. In this sense, the Sendai Educational Research Institutewas quite unique in pre-war Japan. To realize the project, the mayor, Tokusaburou SHIBUYA and Heizi OIKAWA played importantroles; SHIBUYA proposed the foundation of the Institute and OIKAWA was appointed as the first directorof the Institute. They both emphasized most that education should provide the quality and acquirementas "Citizens" with children in Sendai city, and put in an effort to establish educational methodsfor that kind of education among teachers. Although the first year project was not necessarily accepted to the Sendai city council at the beginning,the project was driven forward by a strong backup from the mayor SHIBUYA...|$|R

40|$|We {{present results}} from the first {{successful}} open call electronic very-long-baseline interferometry (e-VLBI) science run, observing the X-ray binary GRS 1915 + 105. e-VLBI science allows the rapid production of VLBI radio maps, within hours of an observation rather than weeks, facilitating a decision for follow-up observations. A total of six telescopes observing at 5 GHz across the European VLBI Network (EVN) were correlated in real time at the Joint <b>Institute</b> <b>for</b> VLBI in <b>Europe</b> (JIVE).

50|$|There {{are several}} VLBI arrays located in Europe, Canada, the United States, Russia, Korea, Japan, Mexico and Australia. The most {{sensitive}} VLBI array {{in the world}} is the European VLBI Network (EVN). This is a part-time array which brings together the largest European radiotelescopes for typically week-long sessions, with the data being processed at the Joint <b>Institute</b> <b>for</b> VLBI in <b>Europe</b> (JIVE). The Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) uses ten dedicated, 25-meter telescopes spanning 5351 miles across the United States, and is the largest VLBI array that operates all year round as both an astronomical and geodesy instrument. The combination of the EVN and VLBA is known as Global VLBI. When one or both of these arrays are combined with one or more space-based VLBI antennas such as HALCA (previously) and now with RadioAstron (Spektr-R), the resolution obtained is higher than any other astronomical instrument, capable of imaging the sky with a level of detail measured in microarcseconds. VLBI generally benefits from the longer baselines afforded by international collaboration, with a notable early example in 1976, when radio telescopes in the United States, USSR and Australia were linked to observe hydroxyl-maser sources.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Recent {{achievements}} at the EVN Mk IV {{data processor}} at JIVE include decreasing the read-out {{time for the}} whole correlator to 0. 25 s (or 0. 125 s for half the correlator), improving the end quality of user data (e. g., applying an improved 2 -bit van Vleck correction), developing new astronomical capabilities (e. g., oversampling to× 4, wider-field mapping), and strengthening liaison procedures with PIs (e. g., pipelining, the EVN Archive facility). At the same time, the move to a disk-based EVN and regular incorporation of FTP fringe-checks is well underway, resulting in more reliable data quality. We will review these developments, highlighting how they may broaden the kinds of astronomy you can do. We’ll also go over some measures {{you can take to}} help you {{get the most out of}} these new/improved features. 1.

30|$|One {{important}} {{way in which}} educational leaders may impact quality teaching is by fostering teacher professional learning (cf. Hoekstra and Crocker 2015 a, b; Robinson et al. 2008; Hallinger 2011). Studies into workplace learning suggest that leadership practices by direct supervisors may {{make a difference in}} fostering employee learning (Ellström and Ellström 2014). In <b>institutes</b> <b>for</b> VPE in <b>Europe,</b> teachers’ perception of leadership practices have indeed been related to teachers’ engagement in professional development in VPE (Oude Groote Beverborg et al. 2015 b; Runhaar et al. 2010). While instructors’ perception of leadership matters, these studies do not provide insights into how and why such leadership practices are enacted in their departments. Moreover, much research on leadership for teaching and learning has been quantitative and has been conducted in the context of K- 12 education (cf. Geijsel et al. 2009; Leithwood and Jantzi 2006; Robinson et al. 2008). The present study therefore includes a qualitative exploration of leadership for learning, describing the ways seven department chairs 1 and associate chairs in VPE conceptualize and enact their role as leaders of teaching and learning within the context of their department. This description illustrates the complex dynamics of teaching and leading in VPE departments, elucidating aspects of leadership that require further research, and generating suggestions for support for leadership development of chairs.|$|R
