An enhanced understanding {{of a wide range of}} aid workers’ stressors and effective coping strategies is important for informing responses to stress at the levels of individuals, organisations and the broader aid sector. <b>For</b> <b>individual</b> <b>aid</b> workers, findings from the present research can be used to normalise stress and disseminate information on the range of commonly used coping styles. Organisations can use aid worker views to improve structures and staff support. At the sector level, results can inform staff-care resources and interventions to reduce staff stress. Given the importance of aid workers to the sector, efforts to reduce staff stress can have flow-on benefits for the delivery of aid.|$|E

Sharing common stressors has been beneficial in other sectors including the disclosure of traumatic incidences among health practitioners (Farrington 1995). Many respondents to our survey reported that they wanted to hear more about other aid workers’ common stressors to help normalise their experiences. Such normalisation through sharing may be particularly pertinent in the aid sector where stigma often prevents discussion of mental health issues (Fechter 2012).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the extent to which {{incontinence}} aids, used in local authority/municipal nursing homes, were adapted to the resident’s urine-leakage volume and to find out how nurses perceived the current situation concerning individual testing of incontinence aids in municipal nursing homes. The study method was a quantitative empirical study and was carried out in two phases. The first phase was a weighing test, carried out in three nursing homes, whereby the incontinence aids used by 25 residents during a 48 hour period were weighed. The second phase was the completion of a questionnaire by the municipal nurses working in the same local authority. The questionnaire covered: the division of responsibilities; routines for testing incontinence aids, and the level of knowledge concerning <b>individual</b> incontinence <b>aid</b> testing. Only 22 % of the pads used during the observation were properly adapted to the patients’ urinary leakage volume, while 76 % of incontinence aids were larger than necessary in relation to the real volume of urinary leakage. The municipal nurses, who have a key role and formal responsibility <b>for</b> <b>individual</b> incontinence <b>aid</b> testing, considered that there was insufficient knowledge within the organisation concerning <b>individual</b> incontinence <b>aid</b> testing, and that the division of responsibilities in this area was unclear. There were great variations relating to the extent of the nurses’ involvement in <b>individual</b> incontinence <b>aid</b> testing, and the nurses stated that increased involvement in <b>individual</b> incontinence <b>aid</b> testing was dependent on more time being made available for this task.

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 2003 Dr. Justin Andrew ZakisDigital hearing aids have {{an increasing number of}} adjustable amplification parameters, which offer the potential of greater customisation of their amplification settings to the needs and preferences of <b>individual</b> <b>aid</b> users. However, an increased number of adjustable amplification parameters, which may have counteracting effects, can increase the complexity of the fitting procedure, and the difficulty in achieving the combination of amplification parameter values that are optimal <b>for</b> the <b>individual</b> <b>aid</b> user. The latter is {{compounded by the fact that}} hearing aids are adjusted with a limited range of acoustic stimuli in a clinic environment, away from the real-life acoustic environments where the amplification provided by hearing aids may be less satisfactory. The customisation of hearing-aid amplification parameters <b>for</b> the <b>individual</b> <b>aid</b> user could be more efficiently and effectively performed with a trainable hearing aid. Such a hearing aid 'learns' the aid user's amplification preferences in everyday acoustic environments, and after sufficient training, automatically varies its amplification settings to the preference of the aid user for the current acoustic environment. However, to the knowledge of this author, the efficacy of trainable hearing aids has not been published in scientific journals. This thesis describes the design, development, and evaluation of a novel trainable hearing aid. In order to evaluate the novel trainable hearing aid, two laboratory experiments and three field trials were conducted to test three main hypotheses: and one sub-hypothesis. For one experiment, the amplification preferences of a hypothetical aid user were communicated to the developed aid under controlled conditions, and used by the aid to calculate a set of trained amplification parameters. The trained amplification parameters resulted in the application of amplification settings that were closer to the hypothetical preferred settings than were the original untrained settings. The results of this experiment supported the first hypothesis. For the other laboratory experiment, the speech-to-noise ratio estimation technique used by the aid was evaluated under controlled conditions (the developed aid periodically estimated the speech-to-noise ratio from a statistical analysis of the microphone signal, and could vary its gain with the speech-to-noise ratio estimates as determined by a trainable amplification parameter). It was found that when speech was present, the speech-to-noise ratio estimation technique used by the novel aid provided estimates that were linearly correlated with the reference estimates over a range of (mainly positive) speech-to- noise ratios, which partly supported sub-Hypothesis 2 a. A training trial was conducted, where the developed aid was fitted to 18 hearing-impaired subjects, who trained the aid in the acoustic environments they encountered in everyday life. The data that was logged in the aids during this trial indicated that, for some compression channels, the relationship between the amplification preferences of the subjects and the speech-to-noise ratio relative to the average for all channels (as estimated by the aid) was significant, which partly supported the second hypothesis. Most subjects who had completed the training trial participated in the comparison trials, where a modified version of the developed aid allowed the subjects to blindly compare their trained and untrained settings in everyday acoustic environments, and log their preferred settings in the aid's non-volatile memory. The results of the comparison trials showed that, in everyday environments, most subjects preferred the trained settings to the untrained settings on a statistically-significant majority of occasions, which supported the third hypothesis. Furthermore, it was found that the proportion of occasions when the trained settings were preferred was positively correlated with the amount of time the subjects used the aid during the training trial. Therefore, the main findings of this research project were that under controlled acoustic conditions, a hearing aid can be trained to provide amplification settings that are closer to hypothetical preferred settings than were the initial untrained settings, and in everyday acoustic environments, hearing aid users can train an aid to provide amplification settings that they prefer to the untrained settings on a significant majority of occasions.

40|$|Abstract: Leading constructors will {{alter the}} {{economic}} model {{in order to}} take advantage of IT opportunities in the coming years. Strategic business leaders aren’t interested in playing with computer tools that nibble at the margins of individual productivity; they seek the substantial savings in costs and improvements in service that have been won in manufacturing, retail, and financial services industries. These victories are achieved by using the power of technology to streamline and improve entire supply chains; not just to automate processes within the walls of one firm. The construction industry is currently organized on an “every man for himself ” business basis: each firm holds its information within its walls. Therefore, the compelling IT strategies in construction and engineering will incorporate economic incentives that overcome this barrier and make it worthwhile <b>for</b> <b>individual</b> actors to <b>aid</b> the whole supply chain. What are these tools? How might the incentives be structured? The marriage of technology tools and business incentives is the core of a strategic vision for information technology in construction for the next decade. The author is Chairman of the George B. H.

The novel polyether(meth) acrylate based material class has outstanding material characteristics in combination with the advantages of being a biocompatible (meth) acrylate based processing material. FlexSL shows very promising results in several initial biocompatibility tests. This emphasizes its non-toxic behavior in a biomedical environment, caused mainly by the (meth) acrylate based core components. A short overview of mechanical and processing properties will be given in the end. The herein presented novel FlexSL materials show a significant lower cytotoxicity in contrast to commercial applied acrylic stereolithography resins. Further biocompatibility tests according to ISO 10993 protocols are planned. On the one hand, there are technical applications for this material (e. g. flaps, tubes, hoses, cables, sealing parts, connectors and other technical rubber-like applications), and on the other hand, broad fields of potential biomedical applications in which the FlexSL materials can be beneficial are obvious. Especially these could be small series production of medical products with special flexible material requirements. In addition, the usage <b>for</b> <b>individual</b> soft hearing <b>aid</b> shells, intra-operative planning services and tools like intra-op cutting templates and sawing guides is very attractive. The possibility to modify the FlexSL resins also for high-resolution applications makes it possible to manufacture now very flexible micro-prototypes with outstanding material characteristics and very fine structures with a minimum resolution of 20 mym and a layer thickness of minimal 5 myrn.

40|$|The federal {{government}} delivers substantial college aid through the tax code, after introducing education tax credits in 1998 and a tuition deduction in 2002. The {{design of the}} Lifetime Learning tax credit and the tuition deduction may make them particularly useful to older students.
