5|$|Some {{conformation}} flaws {{common in}} the breed that may hinder a trotter's success include a heavy forehand and overangulated hind legs. Another problem that affects some Finnhorses <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> trot with the front and hind legs directly in line with other, which creates a high probability of forging, where the hind hooves hit the front pasterns, which can cause breaking gait. This can be helped to a degree with careful shoeing. There is also a tendency toward ossification of the hoof cartilages of the front feet, which tends to increase with age, {{and appears to be}} heritable. This condition, called sidebone when it affects the lateral and medial cartilages of the foot, is common in draught breeds. However, a study of affected Finnhorses also noted that horses with long toes and low heels were common and ossification correlated with the length of the heels.|$|E
25|$|In the UK there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> drop apostrophes in many {{commonly}} used {{names such as}} St Annes, St Johns Lane, and so on.|$|E
25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> abandon {{traditionally}} gender-invariable adjectives {{in favour}} of marked ones, something prevalent in Occitan and French. Thus, one can find bullent/bullenta ("boiling") in contrast with traditional bullent/bullent.|$|E

25|$|The Yoko'tan {{family is}} nuclear, monogamous, and cohesive. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> marry young, and gender roles are {{specifically}} defined. Nonetheless, women are accorded more respect in traditional villages than in villages with high mestizo populations.|$|E
25|$|Within theistic mysticism {{two broad}} tendencies can be identified. One <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> {{understand}} God by asserting what He {{is not and}} the other by asserting what He is. The former leads to what is called apophatic theology and the latter to cataphatic theology.|$|E
25|$|Mormons' {{political}} affiliations tend to vary geographically: {{while in}} Utah and Idaho {{the majority of}} members incline to vote Republican, in traditionally more Democratic U.S. regions such as New England and California, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> have more Democratic members. Outside the United States, Mormons tend to follow national and geographical political trends.|$|E
50|$|Disjunctive pronouns {{are often}} semantically restricted. For example, in a {{language}} with grammatical gender, there may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> use masculine and feminine disjunctive pronouns primarily for referring to animate entities.|$|R
50|$|As per J.A. Tomlin, Special Order Sets {{provide a}} {{powerful}} means of modeling nonconvex functions and discrete requirements, though there has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> {{think of them}} {{only in terms of}} multiple-choice zero-one programming.|$|R
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> {{laugh at}} this explanation, which Susy did not check, {{but after a}} few moments she held up a finger, which {{produced}} instant silence, while she drew a letter from her pocket.|$|R
25|$|The black-bellied {{whistling}} duck {{is mainly}} non-migratory. Birds {{in the extreme}} northern portions of their range (Arizona, Louisiana, and parts of Texas) move south in winter. At {{the heart of their}} range, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> travel in flocks over the winter months, though this behavior is not a true long-range migration but rather local dispersal.|$|E
25|$|The side bolstering in the DeLorean was {{originally}} {{separate from the}} main interior pieces. In cars with this construction, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> place pressure on this piece when entering and exiting the vehicle, which eventually causes the bolstering to separate from the trim panel. To fix this problem, cars built in and after late 1981 have one solid trim piece with the bolster permanently attached.|$|E
25|$|Groups {{also affect}} {{performance}} and productivity. Social facilitation, for example, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> work harder and faster {{in the presence}} of others. Social facilitation increases the dominant responses likelihood, which tends to improve performance on simple tasks and reduce it on complex tasks. In contrast, social loafing is the tendency of individuals to slack off when working in a group. Social loafing is common when the task is considered unimportant and individual contributions are not easy to see.|$|E
50|$|Various {{lines of}} {{evidence}} {{have been cited}} in support of mantle plumes. There is some confusion regarding what constitutes support, as there has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> re-define the postulated characteristics of mantle plumes after observations have been made.|$|R
40|$|In the {{research}} literature on white-collar crime, there seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> claim individual failure rather than systems failure. Occupational crime is often emphasized {{at the expense of}} corporate crime. In {{the research}} literature on misconduct and crime by police officers, however, there seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> claim systems failure. It is argued that police crime <b>is</b> <b>a</b> result of bad practice, lack of resources or mismanagement, rather than acts of criminals. Based on two empirical studies in Norway of business and police crime, this paper is concerned with {{the extent to which the}} rotten apple theory versus the rotten barrel theory can explain crime in business organizations and police organizations...|$|R
25|$|Nationalism was contested by the pro-Russian element {{and by the}} internationalism of {{the labor}} movement. The result <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> class {{conflict}} over nationalism, but the early 1900s the working classes split into the Valpas (class struggle emphasis) and Mäkelin (nationalist emphasis).|$|R
25|$|Another common {{feature of}} polysynthetic {{languages}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> use head marking {{as a means}} of syntactic cohesion. This means that many polysynthetic languages mark grammatical relations between verbs and their constituents by indexing the constituents on the verb with agreement morphemes, and the relation between noun phrases and their constituents by marking the head noun with agreement morphemes. There are some dependent-marking languages that may be considered to be polysynthetic because they use case stacking to achieve similar effects, and very long words.|$|E
25|$|A 2003 {{study by}} economists Robert J. Barro and Rachel McCleary {{suggests}} that societies {{with high levels}} of belief in heaven and high levels of church attendance exhibit high rates of economic growth. Barro and McCleary's model has been influential in subsequent scholarship and, to some observers, it supports the belief that Christianity has {{played a major role in}} South Korea's economic success. The study has been criticised by scholars such as Durlauf, Kortellos and Tan (2006). There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> build megachurches since 2000, that leads some churches to financial debt.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of over 1000 specimens of Coelophysis at the Whitaker quarry at Ghost Ranch, has suggested gregarious behavior to researchers like Schwartz and Gillette. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> see this massive congregation of animals as evidence for huge packs of Coelophysis bauri roaming the land. No direct evidence for flocking exists; the deposits only indicate that {{large numbers of}} Coelophysis, along with other Triassic animals, were buried together. Some of the evidence from the taphonomy of the site indicates that these animals may have been gathered together to feed or drink from a depleted water hole or to feed on a spawning run of fish, and then became buried in a catastrophic flash flood or a drought.|$|E
50|$|The main {{shortcoming}} of the Reid Tenwheeler <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> derail while reversing, particularly over points, {{since the}} trailing drivers were flangeless. On the NGR, this {{was overcome by}} increasing the tyre width of these wheels from 6 in to 7 in.|$|R
50|$|There {{has also}} <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> overemphasize only what an author has {{modified}} {{as being the}} important aspects of his theology (even though such modifications are usually peripheral to the message), while ignoring the possible importance of those things which he has preserved.|$|R
50|$|Owing {{to their}} lack or regular rhythm, these palos are not {{normally}} danced. However, from the 1960s there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> create choreographies for them, as they {{provide an opportunity}} for the dancer to show other aspects of flamenco dance, like braceo (movement of the arms).|$|R
25|$|Yet another {{explanation}} of the high correlation between extraversion and happiness comes from the study by Ashton, Lee, and Paunonen (2002). They suggested that the core element of extraversion <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> behave in ways that attract, hold, and enjoy social attention, and not reward sensitivity. They claimed {{that one of the}} fundamental qualities of social attention is its potential of being rewarding. Therefore, if a person shows positive emotions of enthusiasm, energy, and excitement, that person is seen favorably by others and he or she gains others' attention. This favorable reaction from others likely encourages extraverts to engage in further extraverted behavior. Ashton, Lee, and Paunonen's (2002) study showed that their measure of social attention, the Social Attention Scale, was much more highly correlated with extraversion than were measures of reward sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|Bitterness is of {{interest}} to those who study evolution, as well as various health researchers since {{a large number of}} natural bitter compounds are known to be toxic. The ability to detect bitter-tasting, toxic compounds at low thresholds is considered to provide an important protective function. Plant leaves often contain toxic compounds, yet even amongst leaf-eating primates, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> prefer immature leaves, which tend to be higher in protein and lower in fiber and poisons than mature leaves. Amongst humans, various food processing techniques are used worldwide to detoxify otherwise inedible foods and make them palatable. Furthermore, the use of fire, changes in diet, and avoidance of toxins has led to neutral evolution in human bitter sensitivity. This has allowed several loss of function mutations that has led to a reduced sensory capacity towards bitterness in humans when compared to other species.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{publication}} of Kenneth Frampton's Modern Architecture: A Critical History (first edition 1980) {{there has been a}} keen consciousness of the role of criticism within architectural theory. Whilst referencing Derrida as a philosophical influence, deconstructivism can also be seen as having as much a basis in critical theory as the other major offshoot of postmodernism, critical regionalism. The two aspects of critical theory, urgency and analysis, are found in deconstructivism. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> re-examine and critique other works or precedents in deconstructivism, and also a tendency to set aesthetic issues in the foreground. An example of this is the Wexner Center. Critical Theory, however, had at its core a critique of capitalism and its excess, and from that respect many of the works of the Deconstructivists would fail in that regard if only they are made for an elite and are, as objects, highly expensive, despite whatever critique they may claim to impart on the conventions of design.|$|E
5000|$|Once insurgents began {{capturing}} {{foreigners in}} Iraq, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> dress {{them in the}} same orange jumpsuits as their own forces were being dressed in when delivered to Guantanamo Bay - considered by some to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> sign of the insurgents [...] "equating" [...] the captures.|$|R
