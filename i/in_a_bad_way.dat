5|$|Scully {{does the}} autopsy on the {{invisible}} body by covering it in powder. Mulder, meanwhile, researches {{the owner of}} the container. He learns that the man in the picture was extremely wealthy and lucky for a short period, before he died with a giant oversized penis. Mulder believes the woman in the picture is responsible for everything, and determines she is a jinniyah, or a female jinn. Mulder goes to the Stokes residence and asks Leslie to hand her over, presuming her to be kept in a box. It turns out, however, that she is not in the box, but back in the storage facility, where Mulder also finds pictures of the jinniyah next to Benito Mussolini in the 1930s and next to Richard Nixon in the 1960s, two men that had a lot of power and lost it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{front of}} 14,623, {{far short of}} a sell-out, Mayweather won via TKO in the 10th round, surpassing Rocky Marciano and setting {{the record for the}} longest active unbeaten streak in a {{professional}} career at 50–0. In the opening round, Mayweather, as per previous fights, started slow to work out McGregor's tactics. In his post-fight interview, he revealed {{it was part of the}} game plan to let McGregor punch himself out in the early rounds. McGregor won the first round on all three judges scorecards, the same case could have been made for the opening three rounds. McGregor was warned a few times through the fight for hitting behind the head, but no points were deducted by referee Robert Byrd. By the fourth round, McGregor began to tire and breathe heavily with his mouth open. Mayweather started to take control and landed with his right hands. For the next few rounds, McGregor came out throwing shots in the opening 30 seconds, but immediately tired, giving Mayweather enough time to carry on landing clean shots and winning the rounds. By round 9, McGregor had almost nothing left. Although he didn't look hurt, he was very fatigued and his face started showing redness. Two of the judges scored the round 10–8 for Mayweather. In round 10, McGregor staggered across the ring and was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>way</b> against the ropes as Mayweather landed some hard shots. With McGregor barely on his feet after a few unanswered punches, the referee waived the fight off. The time of stoppage was 1 minute and 5 seconds of round 10.|$|E
500|$|On December 13, newly signed Mets closer Francisco Rodríguez {{added his}} sentiments to the fray. [...] "Of course we're {{going to be}} the frontrunner. Of course we're {{going to be the}} team to beat", Rodriguez told reporters. [...] "I don't want there to be a controversy. I don't want the other team to take it personally, or take it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>way.</b> But I'm a really {{competitive}} guy. I like to win. If they ask me, 'Oh, which ballclub is going to win the National League East?' It's going to be the Mets. Easy question." ...|$|E

500|$|... "There isn't {{a team in}} the National League that's {{better than}} us. The pressure's back on them if you ask me. They were on paper {{the best team in}} the {{division}} last year and they were supposed to win, and they didn’t. One, there are four other teams in our division who are going to make sure that doesn't happen, and two, has anyone ever heard of plagiarism? [...] That was pretty good, especially coming from him. He's a quiet guy, so it was probably shocking when he said it. Not shocking <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>way,</b> like 'Wow, I can't believe he said that.' More like, 'Wow, he finally said something because he's a leader on that team and you definitely need to be a vocal leader." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Little Girl in the Big Ten" [...] {{was written}} by {{producer}} Jon Vitti and directed by Lauren MacMullan. The idea for the episode was pitched by Vitti, who suggested an episode in which Lisa meets girls who {{thought she was a}} college student. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on May 12, 2002. Jean thought the idea was [...] "brilliant", and the subplot involving Bart in a [...] "germ-free" [...] plastic bubble was conceived by the writers wanting to make [...] "the most different subplot from an intellectual college plot" [...] they could think of. A scene in the episode shows Lisa talking to Bart on the branch of a tree in their garden. Bart says the line [...] "You can't believe what that sunset looks like to me", to which Lisa replies [...] "That's not a sunset, that's a bird on fire." [...] Originally, Lisa's line read [...] " [...] that's a plane on fire," [...] however, after the September 11 attacks, the line was considered offensive and was changed. [...] " [...] since we work so far ahead we usually do these things that are sort of timeless stories," [...] Jean said, [...] "but {{every once in a while}} there's something that turns out to be ironic <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>way,</b> then we have to change it." ...|$|E

I {{went to see}} {{her last}} Sunday, the 23rd May, and found her in a sad state, {{suffering}} from pains in her toes and the soles of her feet until the tears came into her eyes. I went away because I saw that she refrained from crying out on my account. I thought she was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>way.</b> A consultation was held by her three physicians, the result of which was that they determined to bleed her in the feet. They had some difficulty in persuading her to submit to it, because {{the pain in her}} feet was so great that she uttered the most piercing screams if the bedclothes only rubbed against them. The bleeding, however, succeeded, and she was in some degree relieved. It was the gout in both feet ...|$|E

2500|$|Summer and Ed join in {{with the}} {{argument}} {{and there is a}} lot of shouting. Lucas explained [...] "Summer's aware they've overloaded the car, so she wants to keep calm. She can sense Chris is getting stressed by all the yelling, so she's very tense." [...] As Chris tries to concentrate on the road, Andrew accidentally bumps his arm and he suddenly loses control of the car, which swerves, hits an embankment and flips over before coming to a stop. Sophie is critically injured after being thrown from the vehicle, while Andrew has a serious head injury and Ed is also <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>way.</b> Rhys Lawson (Ben Barber) comes across the scene and puts his own life at risk to start [...] "frantic" [...] rescue efforts. He cuts his hand in the process, but refuses to get it looked when the emergency services arrive. Rhys eventually finds Sophie and when she reaches the hospital, she is rushed into surgery. A writer for Soap World commented that [...] "a terrified" [...] Natasha is worried Ed will not wake up, before she can tell him she loves him. Mason stated that Chris is wracked with guilt and worried for his friends. Things become worse for him when Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) arrives at the hospital and, after learning his son and niece are in a serious condition, threatens to sue him. Mason revealed that Paul is angry and wants someone to pay for what happened, while Dennis explained [...] "Yes, it's typical Paul - someone has to pay and he decides that Chris should take all of the blame before he knows the full story." ...|$|E
2500|$|Inside Soap Kate White later {{focused on}} Michael, {{saying that she}} could [...] "easily believe the worst of Michael Moon." [...] She said it seems [...] "unimaginable" [...] {{that he would have}} the time or energy for an affair, but she [...] "still wouldn't put it past the {{slippery}} eel." [...] She noted that Michael is the only suspect who has previously been involved with Kat, and that it was an emotional affair, rather than just a fling, so with Alfie being distant and Janine pushing Michael away, White said [...] "we don't reckon it would take much for these two to start seeing each other again." [...] She said that Michael has the means, unlike some of the others, as he got Janine to tear up their prenuptial agreement before they married, and the flat that Kat's lover obtained could be listed on the books of Janine's property management business, Butcher's Joints. However, White went on to say, [...] "something tells us Kat would find it very difficult to live with herself if she was sleeping with a man whose baby is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>way.</b> It seems too cruel for a mother who went though the agony of thinking she'd lost her child, so we're not sure at could cause another mum that degree of heartache. Then again, that other woman is Kat's loathed enemy, Janine." [...] Shepherd said that Kat and Michael had [...] "nice chemistry" [...] and opined that Michael [...] "would have been very keen" [...] on a relationship with Kat, that [...] "the opportunity for Michael and Kat to team up has always been there, from the moment he arrived" [...] and that the writers are placed [...] "lots of little hints to insinuate that it could be Michael". Michael was the second suspect to be eliminated, on 14 September 2012.|$|E
