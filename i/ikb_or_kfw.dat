The work was undertaken mainly as desk research drawing on a variety of recently published studies, research, policy documents as well as on documents provided by AFD, JBIC and KfW complemented by interviews with key stakeholders of AFD, KfW and JBIC. It has to be pointed out that the document • Does not give a full overview of AFD, JBIC and KfW's activities in urban infrastructure but rather illustrates issues with selected examples from the three bilateral development banks; and • Reflects the author's views and not those of AFD, JBIC <b>or</b> <b>KfW.</b> Agence Française de Développement (AFD) : www. afd. f...|$|R

40|$|Glucocorticoids are potent {{antiinflammatory}} drugs. They {{inhibit the}} expression of proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules. It has recently been proposed that the underlying basis to such inhibition is the induction of the protein IkB, which inhibits the transcription factor NF-kB. The latter is a key activator of the genes encoding cytokines and adhesion molecules. The present study shows that the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, inhibits the induction of the proinflammatory cytokine IL- 8 and the adhesion molecules VCAM- 1 and ICAM- 1 in human 1321 N 1 astrocytoma and SK. N. SH neuroblastoma cells. However, dexamethasone failed to induce <b>IkB</b> <b>or</b> inhibit activation of NF-kB by IL- 1 in the two cell types. EMSA confirmed {{the identity of the}} activated NF-kB by demonstrating that an oligonucleotide, containing the wild-type NF-kB-binding motif, inhibited formation of the NF-kB-DNA complexes whereas a mutated form of the NF-kB-binding motif was ineffective. In addition, supershift analysis showed that the protein subunits p 50 and p 65 were prevalent components in the activated NF-kB complexes. The lack of effect of dexamethasone on the capacity of IL- 1 to activate NF-kB correlated with its inability to induce IkB and the ability of IL- 1 to cause degradation of IkB, even in the presence of dexamethasone. The results presented in this paper strongly suggest that glucocorticoids may exert antiinflammatory effects in cells of neural origin by a mechanism(s) independent of NF-kB...|$|R
5000|$|UK banking has {{two main}} parts. First, the Bank of England administers {{monetary}} policy, influencing interest rates, inflation and employment, and it regulates the banking market with HM Treasury, the Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority. Second, there are private banks, and some non-shareholder banks (co-operatives, mutual or building societies), that provide credit to consumer and business clients. Borrowing money on credit (and repaying the debt later) {{is important for}} people expand a business, invest in a new enterprise, or purchase valuable assets more quickly than by saving. Every day, banks estimate the prospects of a borrower succeeding or failing, and set interest rates for debt repayments according their predictions of the risk (or average risk of ventures like it). If all banks together lend more money, this means enterprises will do more, potentially employ more people, and if business ventures are productive in the long run, society's prosperity will increase. If banks charge interest that people cannot afford, or if banks lend too much money to ventures that are unproductive, economic growth will slow, stagnate, and sometimes crash. Although UK banks, except the Bank of England, are shareholder or mutually owned, many countries operate public retail banks (for consumers) and public investment banks (for business). The UK used to run Girobank for consumers, {{and there have been}} many proposals for a [...] "British Investment Bank" [...] (like the Nordic Investment Bank <b>or</b> <b>KfW</b> in Germany) since the global financial crisis of 2007-2008, but these proposals have not yet been accepted.|$|R

40|$|Background: Gentian roots {{have been}} used as a herbal {{medicine}} because of their anti-inflammatory activities. However, the molecular mechanisms of these anti-inflammatory effects remain to be completely explained. Methods and Findings: Here, we investigated anti-inflammatory effects of gentian roots and showed that root extracts from Gentiana triflora inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced expression of TNF-a in RAW 264. 7 cells. The extracts also contained swertiamarin and gentiopicroside, which are the major active compounds of gentian roots; however, neither compound had any effect on LPS-induced TNF-a production in our test system. We isolated gentiolactone as an inhibitor of TNF-a production from the extracts. Gentiolactone also inhibited LPS-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase- 2 (Cox- 2) expression at the mRNA level. Moreover, gentiolactone suppressed NF-kB transcriptional activity without inhibition of <b>IkB</b> degradation <b>or</b> NF-kB nuclear transport. Conclusions: Our results indicate that inhibition of TNF-a, iNOS and Cox- 2 expression by gentiolactone is one of the mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory properties of gentian roots...|$|R
30|$|In this study, it {{is shown}} how large is the {{difference}} between buildings of different standards. From the inferences obtained in this simulation, {{it can be seen that}} the building plays an important role in the design of the thermal energy system. More than the energy parameters, the reaction and approach to each building type vary. The KfW 55 and passive house are quite reactive to the changes in the heating implementation. These both buildings need less time to reach the desired set point temperature, especially in a winter early morning where the set point temperature is varied from 16 to 20  °C after the night reduction for energy savings. But in the similar situation for an old house such as WSChVO 95, the heating has to be switched on quite earlier in the morning such as 4 am, if at 7 am the building has to be at 19  °C at least. Moreover, the inlet temperature and the mass flow have to be varied such that the desired room temperature is reached. The approach for a WSchVO 95 building is that the inlet temperature has to vary in an increased slope value to reach the required room temperature along with an increased maximum mass flow so that the heat transfer rate is better. But for a passive house <b>or</b> <b>KfW</b> 55, the slope of the inlet temperature algorithm has to smaller and the mass flow should be set that not lot of heat is transferred in one go which otherwise will create a hysteresis where the heating unit has to be switched on and off a lot of time. Not only the U value (losses) of the building is to be taken into account, but also the g value (the gains: solar and other) should be considered. For a passive house on a spring day, 3 h of sun in the mid-day will be more than sufficient to keep up the heat and reduce the space heating consumption for the remaining of the day. This can be seen by the distribution of the space heating demand difference between the months for each building type. In good insulated houses, it is evident that the space heating demand is 90 % in the 4 winter months. And in the other months, the solar thermal fraction is already above 70 %, e.g., passive house.|$|R

40|$|To counter {{systemic}} {{risk of infection}} by parasitic wasps, Drosophila larvae activate humoral immunity in the fat body and mount a robust cellular response resulting in encapsulation of the wasp egg. Innate immune reactions are tightly regulated and are resolved within hours. To understand the mechanisms underlying activation and resolution of the egg encapsulation response and examine if failure of the latter develops into systemic inflammatory disease, we correlated parasitic wasp-induced changes in the Drosophila larva with systemic chronic conditions in sumoylation-deficient mutants. We have previously reported that loss of either Cactus, the Drosophila (<b>IkB)</b> protein <b>or</b> Ubc 9, the SUMO-conjugating enzyme, leads to constitutive activation of the humoral and cellular pathways, hematopoietic overproliferation and tumorogenesis. Here we report that parasite infection simultaneously activates NF-kB-dependent transcription of Spätzle processing enzyme (SPE) and cactus. Endogenous Spätzle protein (the Toll ligand) is expressed in immune cells and excessive SPE or Spätzle is pro-inflammatory. Consistent with this function, loss of Spz suppresses Ubc 9 2 defects. In contrast to the pro-inflammatory roles of SPE and Spätzle, Cactus and Ubc 9 exert an anti-inflammatory effect. We show that Ubc 9 maintains steady state levels of Cactus protein. In a series of immuno-genetic experiments, we demonstrate {{the existence of a}} robust bidirectional interaction between blood cells and the fat body and propose that wasp infection activates Toll signaling in both compartments via extracellular activation of Spätzle. Within each organ, the IkB/Ubc 9 -dependent inhibitory feedbac...|$|R
40|$|Ovarian cancer, one of inflammation-associated cancers, is {{the fifth}} leading cause of cancer deaths among women. Inflammation in the tumor {{microenvironment}} is associated with peritoneal tumor dissemination and massive ascites, which contribute to high mortality in ovarian cancer. Tumor suppressor p 53 is frequently deleted or mutated in aggressive and high-grade ovarian cancer, probably aggravating cancer progression and increasing mortality. We therefore investigated the influence of p 53 on proinflammatory chemokines in ovarian cancer cells. A PCR array of the chemokine network revealed that ovarian cancer cells with low or mutated p 53 expression expressed high levels of proinflammatory chemokines such as CXCL 1, 2, 3 and 8. Transient transfection of p 53 into p 53 -null ovarian cancer cells downregulated proinflammatory chemokines induced by tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF), a proinflammatory cytokine abundantly expressed in ovarian cancer. Furthermore, p 53 restoration or stabilization blocked TNF-induced NF-kB promoter activity and reduced TNF-activated IkB. Restoration of p 53 increased ubiquitination of IkB, resulting from concurrently reduced proteasome activity followed by stability of IkB. A ubiquitination PCR array on restoration of p 53 did not reveal any significant change in expression except for Mdm 2, indicating that the balance between p 53 and Mdm 2 is more important in regulating NF-kB signaling rather than the direct effect of p 53 on ubiquitin-related genes <b>or</b> <b>IkB</b> kinases. In addition, nutlin- 3, a specific inducer of p 53 stabilization, inhibited proinflammatory chemokines by reducing TNF-activated IkB through p 5...|$|R
40|$|Calcium {{concentration}} {{within the}} endoplasmic reticulum ER) plays {{an essential role}} in cell physiology. We have investigated the effects of basiliolides, a novel class of C 19 dilactones isolated from Thapsia garganica, on Ca 2 + mobilization in T cells. Basiliolide A 1 induced a rapid mobilization of intracellular Ca 2 + in the leukemia T-cell line Jurkat. First, a rapid calcium peak was observed and inhibited by 1, 2 -bis(2 -aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester. This initial calcium mobilization was followed by a sustained elevation, mediated by the entry of extracellular calcium through store-operated calcium release-activated Ca 2 + (CRAC) channels and sensitive to inhibition by EGTA, and by the CRAC channel inhibitor N-{ 4 -[3, 5 -bis(trifluoromethyl) - 1 Hpyrazol 1 -yl] phenyl}- 4 -methyl- 1, 2, 3 -thiadiazole- 5 -carboxamide (BTP- 2). Basiliolide A 1 mobilized Ca 2 + from ER stores, but in contrast to thapsigargin, it did not induce apoptosis. Basiliolide A 1 induced nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 dephosphorylation and activation that was inhibited by BTP- 2 and cyclosporine A. In addition, we found that basiliolide A 1 alone did not mediate <b>IKB</b> alpha degradation <b>or</b> RelA phosphorylation (ser 536), but it synergized with phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate to induce a complete degradation of the nuclear factor-KB inhibitory protein and to activate the c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase. Moreover, basiliolide A 1 regulated both interleukin- 2 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene expression at the transcriptional level. In basiliolide B, oxidation of one of the two geminal methyls to a carboxymethyl group retained most of the activity of basiliolide A 1. In contrast, basiliolide C, where the 15 -carbon is oxidized to an acetoxymethine, was much less active. These findings qualify these compounds as new probes to investigate intracellular calcium homeostasis...|$|R
