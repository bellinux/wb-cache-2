5|$|Deceptive {{markings}} on <b>helicopters</b> further complicated matters for NATO pilots. Many of the combatants painted their <b>helicopters</b> {{to look like}} those of organizations that the UN's Zagreb Flight Coordination Center had authorized to fly in restricted space. For example, {{the army of the}} Republika Srpska often painted a Red Cross logo on their <b>helicopters,</b> and Croatian <b>helicopters</b> were given markings similar to those of UN humanitarian aid <b>helicopters.</b> The questionable identity of these <b>helicopters</b> became particularly problematic after the Black Hawk Incident in Iraq, because NATO pilots became more reluctant to engage potential belligerents without clear identification. As a result of the rules of engagement and difficulties in aircraft identification, NATO forces proved unable to stop most unauthorized helicopter flights, resulting in a documented total of 5711 unauthorized flights during the conflict.|$|E
5|$|One of the <b>helicopters</b> {{was bought}} by Widerøe in December 1976 and the {{operations}} were subcontracted to Offshore <b>Helicopters.</b> The second Sikorsky was bought from Helilift in March 1978 and also operated by Offshore <b>Helicopters.</b> Helikopter Service merged with Offshore <b>Helicopters</b> in 1980, and the new Helikopter Service took over the route. They introduced an eleven-seat Bell 212 <b>helicopters</b> from 1 January 1982 {{because of the high}} maintenance costs of the S-58Ts. In 1982 the service to both islands handled 7,145 passengers and three tonnes of post and cargo, and made 744 landings. It received subsidies for NOK4 million.|$|E
5|$|After {{an hour on}} the ground, the <b>helicopters</b> {{left with}} the first 61 evacuees, {{including}} all American civilians and four heads of mission. Evacuees were provided blankets on one of the flights to remain warm. Complications with the only in-flight refueling on the return nearly prevented refueling, which would have forced the <b>helicopters</b> to divert to the Somali desert and await a rescue. At 9:40, the <b>helicopters</b> arrived on Guam and unloaded the evacuees.|$|E

5|$|Air America <b>helicopters</b> {{continued}} to make rooftop pickups until after nightfall by which time navigation became increasingly difficult. <b>Helicopters</b> overflew the designated LZs to check no Americans {{had been left behind}} and then the last <b>helicopters</b> (many low on fuel) headed out to TF76, located the USS Midway or the USS Hancock and shut down. All Air America flights had ceased by 21:00. With its available fleet of only 20 Hueys (3 of which were impounded, ditched or damaged at TF76), Air America had moved over 1,000 evacuees to the DAO Compound, the Embassy or out to the ships of TF76.|$|E
5|$|Another aspect {{that the}} GAO {{investigation}} revealed {{was that the}} training F-15 pilots received for identifying <b>helicopters</b> was not adequate. Visual ID training was accomplished by reviewing slides on a 35mm projector. <b>Helicopters</b> only made up about 5% of the training slides and nearly all the pictures depicted <b>helicopters</b> from the ground looking up because the pictures were provided by the U.S. Army. Investigators also learned from interviewing other F-15 pilots that helicopter recognition was not regarded as an important skill within the F-15 pilot community because <b>helicopters</b> are not considered a threat to F-15s in air-to-air combat.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the Joint Research and Development Committee with Spaatz, Devers took an {{interest}} in the development of <b>helicopters,</b> taking rides in different machines. He met with Larry Bell, the founder of Bell Aircraft.

40|$|The {{ability to}} compute the weight and balance of a <b>helicopter</b> in flight under general {{conditions}} is an enabling technology for future condition based maintenance systems as well as advanced automatic flight control systems. This paper creates a real-time weight and balance estimation algorithm using an extended Kalman filter framework. To highlight estimation characteristics, the algorithm is exercised on the OH- 6 A <b>helicopter</b> {{in a variety of}} flight regimes. The algorithm is shown to work well in hover and forward flight as well as situations where loads are dropped and picked up in flight. Typically the algorithm quickly estimates station line and butt line mass center position (1 sec) and more slowly converges on <b>helicopter</b> weight (10 sec). To estimate <b>helicopter</b> waterline, the algorithm requires maneuvering flight where non zero roll rate is present. The algorithm is also shown to be reasonably robust to sensor and model errors.
