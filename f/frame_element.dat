5000|$|In frame semantics, {{a theory}} of {{linguistic}} meaning, null instantiation {{is the name of}} a category used to annotate, or tag, absent semantic constituents or frame elements (Fillmore et al. 2003, Section 3.4).

40|$|The central {{edge of an}} {{opposing}} pair of luminance gradients (COC edge) makes adjoining regions with identical luminance appear to be different. This brightness illusion, called the Craik-O'Brien-Cornsweet effect (COCe), {{can be explained by}} low-level spatial filtering mechanisms (Dakin & Bex, 2003). Also, the COCe is greatly reduced when the stimulus lacks a <b>frame</b> <b>element</b> surrounding the COC edge (Purves et al., 1999). This indicates that the COCe can be modulated by extra contextual cues that are related to ideas about lighting priors. In this study, we examined whether processing for contextual modulation could be independent of the main COCe processing mediated by the filtering mechanism. We displayed the COC edge and <b>frame</b> <b>element</b> at physically different times. Then, while varying the onset asynchrony between them and changing the luminance contrast of the <b>frame</b> <b>element,</b> we measured the size of the COCe. We found that the COCe was observed in the temporal range of around 600 - 800 ms centered at the 0 ms (from around - 400 to 400 ms in stimulus onset asynchrony), which was much larger than the range of typical visual persistency. More importantly, this temporal range did not change significantly regardless of differences in the luminance contrast of the <b>frame</b> <b>element</b> (5 - 100 %), in the durations of COC edge and/or the <b>frame</b> <b>element</b> (50 or 200 ms), in the display condition (interocular or binocular), and in the type of lines constituting the <b>frame</b> <b>element</b> (solid or illusory lines).

40|$|Finite element {{response}} sensitivities {{represent an}} essential ingredient for gradient-based optimization {{methods used to}} solve problems in structural optimization, structural reliability analysis, structural identification and finite element model updating [1]. Finite element response sensitivities are also invaluable for gaining deeper insight into the effects and relative importance of the various geometric, material, and loading parameters defining the structure and its loading environment. Sensitivity analysis formulations {{have been developed for}} displacement-based finite element models [2] and, recently, for force-based <b>frame</b> <b>elements</b> [3]. The advantages gained in response analysis by using finite element formulations more advanced than the classical displacementbased formulation can be further extended to the realm of response sensitivity analysis. A large body of research has been devoted to mixed finite element formulations since they were first introduced in the pioneering work of Pian [4]. Several finite elements based on different variational principles have been developed and their accuracy and performance have been thoroughly analyzed and improved. Nowadays, mixed finite elements are well established and largely adopted tools {{in a wide range of}} structural mechanics applications. Multi-field mixed finite element formulations were proposed, among others, for finite elements widely used in the structural engineering community such as <b>frame</b> <b>elements.</b> Mixed <b>frame</b> <b>elements</b> are more accurate in nonlinear analysis than displacement-based elements and are a possible alternative to the recently established force-based elements. This paper focuses on the formulation of finite element response sensitivity analysis, using the Direct Differentiation Method (DDM) [2, 3], in the case of a nonlinear three-field mixed approach derived from the Hu-Washizu variational principle [5], considering both quasi-static and dynamic loadings. The general formulation for finite element response sensitivity analysis using the three-field mixed formulation is specialized and applied to <b>frame</b> finite <b>element</b> models. The results of the DDM are validated through the forward Finite Difference Method (FDM) using as application example a realistic steel-concrete composite frame structure subjected to quasistatic and dynamic loading, respectively. Both monolithic <b>frame</b> <b>elements</b> and composite <b>frame</b> <b>elements</b> with deformable shear connection [6] based on the three-field mixed formulation are included in this application example...|$|R

In the last decades, the subject has received much interest from many researchers, especially for seismic applications.

It can be used from early conceptual design to detailed design and for creating construction phase models. It is also a practical tool for managing communication and other data between Designers, Constructor, Fabricators and Contractors. This Master’s thesis is a company specific case study and written for localizing potential in more BIM based project management. Main objective of the research is to formulate a sketch of a suitable BIM based installation logistics and project management system focusing on packing management system and packing order. The research has been delimited to pertain steel frame elements of power plant engine hall. In order to achieve the main objective, installation logistics and other construction management related properties of the chosen softwares Tekla Structures and Tekla BIMsight are examined. Main interests of the constructor company concerning construction management and especially installation logistics are also localized. Furthermore, quality standards for modelling and packing process are defined to achieve the main objective. As a result, findings of the research and suggested tools are evaluated based on the needs of the constructor. Tekla Stuctures can be used for conceptual design, for generating drawings and report, and for erection scheduling. In addition, it {{has turned out to be}} practical software for managing <b>frame</b> <b>element</b> delivery and data needed for site management. Organizer found in Tekla Structures especially is a handy tool for managing information needed for coordination of a site and <b>frame</b> <b>element</b> delivery. Tekla BIMsight is software for project collaboration and can be used for combining the models of different project stakeholders and for <b>frame</b> <b>element</b> unloading and installation management. Tekla BIMsight is a practical tool for making assembly plans and progress reports of site installation works. It can also be used for the supervision of installation works, for <b>frame</b> <b>element</b> unloading and grouping, and for on-site collaboration between structural and MEP works. Use of note files compatible to Tekla Structures and Tekla BIMsight enables BIM based communication between Structural Designers, Project Engineers and Site Supervisors throughout the project. The best way to ensure a practical <b>frame</b> <b>element</b> packing order is to attach an installation sequence number pointing out the required packing order for each steel assembly and to publish these numbers in an assembly list. It is also practical to divide an engine hall for modules and phases if needed using the Organizer tool in Tekla Structures, and to utilize this division for managing <b>frame</b> <b>element</b> delivery. Still, for developing installation logistics further, it is recommendable to seek better frame installation management through more integrated BIM based communication protocols...|$|E
