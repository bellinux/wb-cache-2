40|$|Abstract Background context Vascular {{disease has}} been {{proposed}} as {{a risk factor for}} disc height loss (DHL). Purpose To examine the relationship between quantitative measures of abdominal aortic calcifications (AACs) as a marker of vascular disease, and DHL, on computed tomography (CT). Study design Cross-sectional study in a community-based population. Patient sample Four hundred thirty-five participants from the Framingham Heart Study. Outcome measures Quantitative AAC scores assessed by CT were grouped as tertiles of “no” (reference), “low,” and “high” calcification. Disc height loss was evaluated on CT reformations using a four-grade scale. For analytic purposes, DHL was dichotomized as moderate DHL of at least one level at L 2 –S 1 versus less than moderate or no DHL. Methods We examined the association of AAC and DHL using logistic regression before and after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors and before and after adjusting for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). Results In crude analyses, low AAC (odds ratio [OR], 2. 05 [1. 27 – 3. 30]; p=. 003) and high AAC (OR, 2. 24 [1. 38 – 3. 62]; p=. 001) were strongly associated <b>with</b> <b>DHL,</b> when compared <b>with</b> the reference group of no AAC. Diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and smoking were not associated <b>with</b> <b>DHL</b> and did not attenuate the observed relationship between AAC and DHL. Adjustment for age, sex, and BMI markedly attenuated the associations between DHL and low AAC (OR, 1. 20 [0. 69 – 2. 09]; p=. 51) and high AAC (OR, 0. 74 [0. 36 – 1. 53]; p=. 42). Conclusions Abdominal aortic calcification was associated <b>with</b> <b>DHL</b> in this community-based population. This relationship was independent of cardiovascular risk factors. However, the association of AAC <b>with</b> <b>DHL</b> was explained by the effects of age, sex, and BMI. Sydney Medical Schoo...|$|R

40|$|PurposePatients <b>with</b> double-hit {{lymphoma}} (<b>DHL)</b> rarely achieve {{long-term survival}} following disease relapse. Some patients <b>with</b> <b>DHL</b> undergo consolidative autologous stem-cell transplantation (autoSCT) {{to reduce the}} risk of relapse, although the benefit of this treatment strategy is unclear. MethodsPatients <b>with</b> <b>DHL</b> who achieved first complete remission following completion of front-line therapy with either rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) or intensive front-line therapy, and deemed fit for autoSCT, were included. A landmark analysis was performed, with time zero defined as 3 months after completion of front-line therapy. Patients who experienced relapse before or who were not followed until that time were excluded. ResultsRelapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates at 3 years were 80 % and 87 %, respectively, for all patients (n = 159). Three-year RFS and OS rates did not differ significantly for autoSCT (n = 62) versus non-autoSCT patients (n = 97), but 3 -year RFS was inferior in patients who received R-CHOP compared with intensive therapy (56 % v 88 %; P =. 002). Three-year RFS and OS did not differ significantly for patients in the R-CHOP or intensive therapy cohorts when analyzed by receipt of autoSCT. The median OS following relapse was 8. 6 months. Conclusion In the largest reported series, to our knowledge, of patients <b>with</b> <b>DHL</b> to achieve first complete remission, consolidative autoSCT was not associated with improved 3 -year RFS or OS. In addition, patients treated with R-CHOP experienced inferior 3 -year RFS compared with those who received intensive front-line therapy. When considered in conjunction with reports of patients <b>with</b> newly diagnosed <b>DHL,</b> which demonstrate lower rates of disease response to R-CHOP compared with intensive front-line therapy, our findings further support the use of intensive front-line therapy for this patient population...|$|R
