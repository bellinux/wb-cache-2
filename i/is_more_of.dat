5|$|Weather fronts. Significant shear is {{observed}} {{when the temperature}} difference across the front is 5°C (9°F) or more, and the front moves at 30 knots or faster. Because fronts are three-dimensional phenomena, frontal shear can be observed at any altitude between surface and tropopause, and therefore be seen both horizontally and vertically. Vertical wind shear above warm fronts <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an aviation concern than near and behind cold fronts due to their greater duration.|$|E
5|$|Attitudes {{and social}} {{stereotypes}} can create {{barriers to the}} detection and treatment of alcohol abuse. This <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a barrier for women than men. Fear of stigmatization may lead women to deny that they are suffering from a medical condition, to hide their drinking, and to drink alone. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to {{be less likely to}} suspect that a woman they know is an alcoholic. In contrast, reduced fear of stigma may lead men to admit that they are suffering from a medical condition, to display their drinking publicly, and to drink in groups. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be more likely to suspect that a man they know is an alcoholic.|$|E

5|$|If the player's {{character}} {{falls in}} battle, {{they are forced}} to restart from the beginning, with all their items and experience points gone; to avoid this, the player can store items in warehouses found in towns they travel through. Because of this, the player makes long-term progress by upgrading powerful items at village blacksmiths and storing them in warehouses, while upgrading their character <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a temporary improvement. In the Nintendo DS version of the game, the player can avoid having to start over by getting rescued by another player: this is done by giving the other player a rescue quest, either through a password or the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. When a player embarks on a rescue mission, they start from level 1 and have to reach the fallen character without stopping at towns on their way. If they succeed, the rescued player can proceed from where they left off, and keep their items and experience points.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the Doctor, Jack <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a conventional action hero, as well as outwardly flirtatious and capable of acts which the Doctor would view as less than noble. In the programme's narrative, Jack begins as a time traveller and former con man from the 51st century, who comes to travel with the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) and his companion Rose (Billie Piper). As a consequence of his death and resurrection in the 2005 Doctor Who finale, Jack becomes immortal and is stranded on 19th century Earth. There he becomes a member of Torchwood, a British organization dedicated to combating alien threats. He spends over a century waiting to reunite with the Doctor, over which time he becomes Torchwood's leader. Eventually, he reunites with the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) for several appearances in Doctor Who. Aspects of the character's backstoryboth prior to meeting the Doctor, and during his many decades living on Earthare gradually revealed over Torchwood (and to a lesser extent, Doctor Who) {{through the use of}} flashback scenes and expository dialogue.|$|E
5|$|In the upland {{parts of}} the {{watershed}} of Mahoning Creek, 95 percent of the rock is sedimentary rock, mainly of the Trimmers Rock Formation, the Clinton Group, the Catskill Formation, the Hamilton Group, the Bloomsburg and Mifflintown Formation, the Onondaga and Old Port Formation, and the Wills Creek Formation. The Catskill Formation occurs in a large area in the northeastern part of the watershed and the Trimmers Rock Formation occurs {{in the rest of}} the northern part of the watershed and in the southernmost part of the watershed. The Hamilton Group is to the south of the northern area of the Trimmers Rock Formation and to the north of the southern area of the formation. The Onondaga and Old Port Formation occurs south of the Hamilton Group and near Sechler Run, as does the Keyser and Tonoloway Formation. The Wills Creek Formation is found in the central part of the watershed, as is the Bloomsburg and Mifflintown Formation. The Clinton Group occurs south of these formations and south of the Clinton Group <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the aforementioned formations.|$|E

5|$|Pospisil <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a {{contemporary}} {{rather than a}} rival of Raonic. Owing to their similarity in age—Pospisil is six months older—and {{the fact that both}} are successful products of Tennis Canada's development programs, they have been linked as the leaders {{of a new generation of}} Canadian tennis players. They partnered in doubles frequently early in their careers, winning doubles titles together in junior and ATP Challenger events. Between 2011 and 2015, Raonic and Pospisil have been the two top-ranked Canadian men in year-end rankings. As well as four ATP Challenger and Futures matches, they have played each other in two ATP World Tour matches: Raonic beat Pospisil in the first all-Canadian semifinal at an ATP 1000 tournament, and in the first all-Canadian final in ATP history. They are frequent Davis Cup teammates, and they planned to play doubles together at the 2016 Rio Olympics until Raonic withdrew.|$|E
5|$|The house stands {{mostly as}} it did in 1861 save a few alterations. The front porch was {{screened}} in at the time the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places, the screens have since been removed. At {{the rear of the house}} a small porch was enclosed. In 1909 or 1910 there were major subtractions and replacements. Removed were a cast-iron widow's walk along the roof ridge and a large gable dormer, decorated in the same manner as the cornice decorating the roof trim. The present dormer replaced the larger one and <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a low-shed type.|$|E
5|$|Like all cats, the jaguar is an obligate carnivore, feeding only on meat. It is an {{opportunistic}} {{hunter and}} its diet encompasses at least 87 species. The jaguar can take virtually any terrestrial or riparian vertebrate found in Central or South America, with {{a preference for}} large prey. The jaguar <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a dietary generalist than its Old World cousins: the American tropics have a high diversity of small animals but relatively low populations and diversity of the large ungulates which this genus favors. They regularly take adult caimans, deer, capybaras, tapirs, peccaries, dogs, zorros, and sometimes even anacondas. However, the cat will eat any small species that can be caught, including frogs, mice, birds (mainly ground-based species such as cracids), fish, sloths, monkeys, and turtles; a study conducted in Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in Belize, for example, revealed that the diets of jaguars there consisted primarily of armadillos and pacas. Some jaguars will also take domestic livestock. El Jefe, the only jaguar currently living within {{the territory of the}} United States, has also been found to kill and eat American black bears, as deduced from hairs found within his scats and the partly consumed carcass of a black bear sow with the distinctive puncture marks to the skull left by jaguars. This indicates that jaguars might have once preyed on black bears when the species was still present in the area. Spectacled bears are also known to avoid jaguars, possibly because they may constitute occasional prey items.|$|E
