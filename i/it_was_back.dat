5|$|Back in Egypt, {{and after}} {{a short period of}} rest, Kippenberger set about {{rebuilding}} the battalion, which had lost over half its original complement. Nearly 400 replacements joined the battalion and stragglers continued to arrive for several weeks {{as they made their way}} across the Mediterranean in small sailboats. By mid-June, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> up to strength. Several weeks were spent at the battalion's previous positions at Baggush, engaged in intensive desert training.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} {{spent the}} next several months in training at locations about the central North Island before embarking for New Caledonia in December. Arriving at Nouméa on 31 December 1942, the battalion was earmarked to be the basis for a new brigade, the 15th. However this proved to be only a short-term measure and by March 1943, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> with 14th Brigade. While on New Caledonia, the battalion underwent jungle training and performed security duties before departing for Guadalcanal in mid-August 1943. After stopping briefly at the New Hebrides, it arrived at Guadalcanal on 27 August and spent a month here, establishing camps and conducting patrols to monitor for any surprise landings by the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|When the East India Company {{was taken}} over by the Crown in 1858, the tiger was stored in Fife House, Whitehall until 1868, when it moved down the road to the new India Office, which {{occupied}} part of the building still used by today's Foreign and Commonwealth Office. In 1874 it was moved to the India Museum in South Kensington, which was in 1879 dissolved, with the collection distributed between other museums; the V records the tiger as acquired in 1880. During World War II the tiger was badly damaged by a German bomb which brought down the roof above it, breaking the wooden casing into several hundred pieces, which were carefully pieced together after the war, so that by 1947 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> on display. In 1955 it was exhibited in New York at the Museum of Modern Art through the summer and spring.|$|E

5000|$|Yellow {{cards and}} Red Cards: Cautions and sending-off offenses are also identical, and the {{procedure}} regarding free kicks is the same, although in association football all opponents must stay at least 9.15 metres from the ball until <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>back</b> in play where in futsal, all opponents must stay at least 5 metres from the ball until <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>back</b> in play.|$|R
5|$|The arcs {{are quite}} stable structures. They were {{detected}} by ground-based stellar occultations in the 1980s, by Voyager 2 in 1989 and by Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based telescopes in 1997–2005 and remained at {{approximately the same}} orbital longitudes. However some changes have been noticed. The overall brightness of arcs decreased since 1986. The Courage arc jumped forward by 8° to 294° (it probably jumped over to the next stable co-rotation resonance position) while the Liberté arc had almost disappeared by 2003. The Fraternité and Égalité (1 and 2) arcs have demonstrated irregular variations in their relative brightness. Their observed dynamics is probably related to the exchange of dust between them. Courage, a very faint arc found during the Voyager flyby, was seen to flare in brightness in 1998; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> to its usual dimness by June 2005. Visible light observations show that {{the total amount of}} material in the arcs has remained approximately constant, but they are dimmer in the infrared light wavelengths where previous observations were taken.|$|E

25|$|Game 6 {{was a close}} game all along, and {{the lead}} kept {{fluctuating}} between the two teams. Again, the leading stars on both teams played big games. Detroit pulled away {{early in the fourth}} for an 80–73 lead with five minutes to go, but the Spurs continued to threaten them. Soon, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> to a one-point game.|$|E

25|$|The law {{had been}} changed since Continental's {{bankruptcy}} six years earlier, and it was more difficult to void union contracts in a bankruptcy.

25|$|Pierre Choderlos de Laclos (1741–1803), {{the author}} of Les Liaisons dangereuses was first {{artillery}} officer, involved {{in the development of}} the hollow ball, charged with explosives, bursting on impact. In 1777 he received the mission to install the deemed Régiment de La Fère at Valence in the future barracks of the polygon. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> in Besançon in the summer 1778, perhaps inspired by his city stay, that he undertook the drafting of hiss sulphurous novel.|$|E

This pattern repeated through to the final accident; during that time the Mussel flew with floats for the Short Crusader Schneider Trophy racer and for the de Havilland Moth. Shorts set up a production line for the successful Moth floats.|$|E

25|$|As the World Turns {{remained}} at 1:30/12:30 pm until March 20, 1987, when CBS cancelled the five-year-old Capitol {{in favor of}} The Bold and the Beautiful. CBS scheduled it at 1:30/12:30 pm, and finally settled As the World Turns at 2:00/1:00 pm, where it remained until its final network episode in September 2010. Although facing {{the full length of}} Another World and One Life to Live once again, the Douglas Marland era of 1985 to 1993 had a resurgence in ratings, and by 1991, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> in its once habitual top-four placing.

25|$|After two wins {{to end the}} Twenty20 Cup, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> {{to losing}} in the County Championship, going down to Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge for their eighth loss in nine games.

However, they looked {{unlikely}} to advance further from that third place, as they went down to second-placed Middlesex {{at home in the}} National League, and Middlesex also defeated them in the County Championship encounter, as Glamorgan went down by an innings and 23 runs. They then achieved their second first-class draw of the season, in a three-day match with Bangladesh A where over half the match was lost to rain.|$|E

An evacuation of FAN dependents via helicopter sapped the Neutralist will to resist, and they abandoned Moung Soui. Encircled and outnumbered by their attackers, under tank and artillery fire, the senior Thai officer at the site had to be ordered to withdraw. On 26 June, the Thais were helilifted out in Operation Swan Lake. Special Requirement 8 was disbanded once <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> in Thailand.|$|E
