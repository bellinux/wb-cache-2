In this project, <b>inoculums</b> development for the production of monoclonal antibody against Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) was studied. The scopes focused were the age of <b>inoculums</b> (passage number) and <b>inoculums</b> density at different growth phases. A hybridoma cell line (Hybridoma 192) was cultivated in batch mode with varying <b>inoculums</b> cell densities and growth phases using Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM). The maximum viable cell densities and the average specific MAb production rate (rp) were found to dependent on the <b>inoculums</b> cell density and the growth phases. <b>Inoculums</b> with low cell density at 5 X 104 cells/ml and early log phase (t= 28 h) have the highest average specific MAb production rate but a low maximum viable cell density. Varying <b>inoculums</b> cell densites and growth phases did not affect the specific growth rate, maximum MAb titer and net production of MAb. Since the <b>inoculums</b> density in the range of 5 x 104 cells/ml to 5 x 105 cells/ml and growth phase do not affect the net production of MAb, it is wise to use high initial <b>inoculums</b> cell density at 5 x 105 cells/ml because the cell growth easily and faster compare low <b>inoculums</b> density. For the <b>inoculums</b> age, the average specific MAb production rate decreased when the passage number increased from PN (Passage Number) = 9 to PN= 30.
