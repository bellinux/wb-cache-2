Paleozoic and Mesozoic carbonates and Neogene evaporites host numerous paleokarstic features and solution caves, being of polygenetic and multi-stage origin. Works on <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>karst</b> and sulfide ores emplaced in caves of the Silesian-Kraków region, the large paleokarst caves filled with Permian internal sediment or thermal convection model for caves in the Polish Jura date back to the 1970 s. Quite well-documented <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>karst</b> is preserved as paleokarstic features in several localities in the Silesian-Kraków region, Holly Cross Mts. and Sudetes. Characteristic cave sediments including crystalline calcite spar, sulfide ores emplaced within hydrothermal cave sediments and solution-collapse breccias are associated with these features. Travertines, which are surface manifestation of hypogene karst, dated through their paleontological assemblage, support their post-Variscan-Permian and Late Triassic age. Their hydrothermal origin was also determined by detailed studies of sediments and fluid inclusions. Less certain, based mainly on studies of relict cave morphology and limited calcite spar, are the Cenozoic-Paleogene and Neogene hypogene events in the Carpathians (Tatra Mts.) and their foreland (Polish Jura). Review of published references and concepts related to hypogene origin of caves and karst in Poland is presented in this contribution...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This study {{focuses on}} the {{discharge}} characteristics of the Buda Thermal Karst (Budapest, Hungary) found at the Rose and Gellért Hills. The Buda Thermal Karst is a recently active <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>karst</b> system {{in the heart of}} Budapest. Studying this unique hydrogeologic system is thus a challenge because of the human impact effects. The research approach is based on the concept of hydrological system analysis (Engelen and Kloosterman 1996), which means that the flow system geometry and recharge-discharge features must correlate when the influence of man on the flow regimes of an area is negligible. Therefore the flow system geometry could be deduced from the evaluation of manifestations of flowing groundwater. To achieve this archival hydrogeologic data and recent observations were used. Based on the localization of springs, collections of archival temperature and chemical data, as well as recent observations, conceptual models were established for the discharge in the Rose Hill and Gellért Hill areas. The observations indicate different discharge characteristics for the two study areas...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the manner in}} which Upper Silesian zinc-lead ores of Mississippi Valley type were introduced into, and deposited within, the ore-bearing dolomite, the host rock of the ores. The ore-bearing dolomite is a neosome developed in Triassic carbonates through dolomitization of limestones and recrystallization of primary or early diagenetic dolomites. It contains three types of ore: (1) ore deposited in rock openings; (2) metasomatically emplaced ore; and ($) ore that crystallized in disaggregated, i. e., delithified, dolomite. The ores were emplaced by mineralizing solutions circulating through an aquifer(s) in lithified rocks. The action of these solutions, combined with that of mobilized ground waters, accounts for the formation of the ore-bearing dolomite. The sulfide ores definitely are epigenetic in relation to their host rocks, and {{there is no evidence that}} they were ever part of primary bottom sediments. Further, no evidence is known to us of lateral deposition within the Triassic strata. Mineralization worked outward from those rock volumes that contained the greatest abundance of solution voids. Ample geologic evidence, discussed inthis paper, confirmed by measurements of temperature ranges for sulfide precipitation, clearly points to ascending hydrothermal so-lutions as the progenitors of the ore mineralization. These solutions are thought o be responsible for the formation of conspicuous mineralized <b>karst</b> structures (<b>hydrothermal</b> <b>karsts)</b> that are among the most important ore hosts in the Upper Silesian ore district. The geologic evidence (as detailed in this paper) also indicates that the hydrothermal ore-bearing solutions rose on a broad front along the northeastern margin of the Silesian basin and, after gaining access to the Triassic aquifer, spread laterally to the south and southwest...|$|R

40|$|The Olavi Mountain Land is a 10 000 km 2 mineral {{province}} {{located at}} the eastern extremity of the exposed Northern Platform of the Damara Pan African orogenic belt. The Olavi Mountain Land is tbe most important mineral province on the Northern Platform. Exploitation of tbe Cu-Pb-Zn-V province has been on-going since the possession of the territory by the German colonial authority in 1890. Production has been mostly from four mines which in order of importance are Tsumeb, Kombat, Berg Aukas and Abeoab. A second mineral province on the Northern Platform located in the west is centred on Sesfontein where as yet only insignificant mineralization has been noted. Besides these localities, the Northern Platform is conspicuously devoid of notable mineralization. The aim of this thesis has been to document tbe Berg Aukas deposit, an important end-member type of mineralization in the Otavi Mountain Land. The basic premise bas been to show tbat the derivation and localization of the mineralization {{is a consequence of}} two broad controls which can be simply summarised as features of the basement and of the carbonate sequences. The geodynamic evolution of the Damara Belt commenced with intra-continental rifting approximately 900 Ma ago. Rift grabens trending north-east were filled by the Nosib Group which comprises mostly clastic lithologies but also some volcanics. The earliest and largest rift {{is referred to as the}} Northern Rift. Separation of the Congo, Kalahari, and proto-South American cratons resulted in rifting and rapid downwarping so that an encroaching sea and an Olavi Group carbonate shelf developed along the northern margin of the Northern Rift. Significantly, the carbonates only covered the Northern Rift in the area of the Otavi Mountain Land where a basinal dome, referred to as the Grootfontein Basement High, marked the basin edge. In the west, the carbonates covered the less important Sesfonfein Rift, and it is only in these two areas where Nosib sequences underlie the carbonate platform. Carbonate sedimentation was interrupted by a major period of crustal readjustment and the deposition of an extensive mixtite throughout the geosynclinal Swakop Trough and Northern Platform. This is referred to as the Chuos Formation and subdivides the Olavi Group into a lower Abenab and an upper Tsumeb Subgroup. Reversal of spreading led to plate collision and subduction of tbe Kalahari craton beneath the Congo craton. It was accompanied by orogenesis which resulted in F 1 folding of the Northern Platform into a series of north-easterly trending intermontane basins into which a molasse sequence known as the Mulden Group was unconformably deposited. Following this major north-south deformation mild east-west compression initiated F 2 folding and the formation of doubly plunging synclines. The Berg Aukas Syncline represents a primary depositional basin which was subsequently folded. The original basin was formed by late Nosib rifting wben spreading caused the Swakop geosynclinal Trough to form. Carbonates of the basal Berg Aukas Formation were deposited in a lagoonal setting typified by reef and fore-reef facies witb peri-platform conditions. Rapid subsidence caused these sediments to be overlain by deep water carbonates of the Gauss Formation. Two styles of mineralization known as the Tsumeb-type and Berg Aukas-type are stratigraphically, isotopically, and mineralogically distinct. The Tsumeb-type is a cupriferous variety of discordant bodies confined to the upper sequences beneath the Mulden unconformity. The Berg Aukas-type is a Zn-Pb variety confined to tbe basal unconformity. The Berg Aukas deposit comprises three ore bodies known as the Northern Ore Horizon, the Central Ore Body, and the Hanging Wall Ore Body. Sphalerite and galena constitute the bypogene ore. Willemite, smithsonite, cerussite, and descloizite are important supergene ores. A review of genetic models concludes that a magmatic origin initially proposed for tbe Tsumeb deposit is entirely rejected and a basin dewatering model in line with Mississippi Valley-type deposits is proposed. The syntectonic nature of mineralization at Berg Aukas and elsewhere in the Otavi Mountain Land indicates that orogenesis encouraged dewatering and leaching of metals from a broad mineralizing front along the margin of the Swakop Trough. These were transported by acidic saline brines which migrated along the clastic aquifers and structural conduits provided by the Northern Rift. Fluid inclusion studies indicate that the hydrothermal fluids at Berg Aukas were very saline (23 % TDS) and were transported at temperatures ranging between 92 ° to 210 °C. Hydrothermal fluids which mineralized Berg AukaS-type deposits migrated along the basal unconformity towards the basement high and were responsible for hydrothermally altering the basement granites and gabbros and the Nosib clastic rocks. Tsumeb-type deposits resulted by migration of fluids through the carbonate pile and along north-easterly trending basement geofractures. As a consequence of variation in transport, the Berg Aukas-type and Tsumeb-type fluids leached different sources and therefore derived mineralogically and isotopically seperable characteristics. The localization of the Berg Aukas ores was controlled by the carbonate stratigraphy and structure. <b>Hydrothermal</b> <b>karsting</b> and ore deposition took place on the contact between Massive Grey and Light Grey Dolostones which represents a permeability contrast. The movement of the hydrothermal fluids was controlled by north-south trending vertical fractures caused by F 2 folding which resulted in a peric 1 inal structure. <b>Hydrothermal</b> <b>karsting</b> was accompanied by ca 1 citic, dolomitic and silicic alteration. The heated acidic fluids initiated solution collapse and a variety of breccia types. Supergene processes resulted in oxidation and upgrading of the ore. Vanadium derived indirectly from gabbros in the basement complex were transported as calcium metavanadate complexes and deposited on contact with the oxidizing base metal sulphides. ...|$|R

Since groundwater equilibrates rapidly with carbonates, the presence of dissolution cavities in deep carbonate host rocks is a paradox.

With the aid of geochemical modeling we show that mixing two warm solutions saturated with carbonate results in a new solu-tion that dissolves limestone.

An image processing workflow has been developed for differentiating limestone from dolomite, providing additional sedimentary and diagenetic information, and the possibility to quantitatively delineate diagenetic phases in an accurate way. Spectral absorption signatures can be linked to specific sedimentary or diagenetic products, such as recent and palaeokarst, <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>karst,</b> (solution enlarged) fractures and different dolomite types. Some of the spectral signatures are related to iron, manganese, organic matter, clay and/or water content.

40|$|Progress in the {{understanding}} of cave genesis processes, as well as the intensive research carried out in the Alps during the last decades, permit to summarize the latest knowledge about Alpine caves. The phreatic parts of cave systems develop close to the karst water table, which depends on the spring position, which in turn is generally related to the valley bottom. Thus, caves are directly linked with the geomorphic evolution of the surface and reflect valley deepening. The sediments deposited in the caves help to reconstruct the morphologic succession and the paleoclimatic evolution. Moreover, they are the only means to date the caves and thus the landscape evolution. Caves appear as soon as there is an emersion of limestone from the sea and a water table gradient. Mesozoic and early tertiary paleokarsts within the alpine range prove of these ancient emersions. <b>Hydrothermal</b> <b>karst</b> seems to be more widespread than previously presumed.

40|$|Documenting {{the source}} and {{processes}} controlling dissolved sulfur (S) mineralization in thermo-mineral waters of the Cerna Valley, Romania is important to understanding speleogenesis in this karst region, in addition to understanding hydrogeological controls, therapeutic qualities and sustainability of the region 2 ̆ 7 s historic spas. Stable S and carbon (C) isotopic results reported here elucidate controls on redox processes, the source of dissolved S mineralization, and sulfur-bearing mineral precipitation in this unique <b>karst</b> <b>hydrothermal</b> system. At reservoir temperatures {{that occur in the}} Cerna Valley aquifers, it is likely that thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) is the dominant S reduction pathway. However the apparent isotope enrichment that we observed between coexisting dissolved sulfate and sulfide is higher than normally associated with TSR—a fact that likely reflects rapid redox cycling at low grade hydrothermal temperatures. δ 13 C values of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) are consistent with TSR using methane as an electron donor. δ 34 S values of total dissolved S (sum of sulfide and sulfate) in all springs sampled and particularly in those for which closed-system conditions can be demonstrated, is greater than + 16 ‰, consistently pointing to dissolved S that derives from marine-derived sulfate mineral sources. To this combined S–C isotope data set, we apply a model of Rayleigh distillation which describes exponentially increasing δ 34 S values of a diminishing sulfate reservoir during TSR, and linearly decreasing δ 13 C values of DIC indicating mixing of C from the electron donor involved in TSR. Comparison of our results to this model shows two distinct stages of TSR during transport of fresh water from karst aquifers towards the local geothermal anomaly. In an up-gradient group of springs and wells, incomplete TSR progress that is limited by energy from electron donors is evident from: low concentrations of dissolved sulfide with low δ 34 S values (as low as − 21. 9 ‰), a large balance of remaining as SO 42 − similar in isotopic composition to its source (∼ + 17. 4 ‰), and δ 13 C values showing little methane-derived DIC. Conversely, in a downstream group of springs and wells, excess concentration of methane provides abundant energy for near-complete TSR, and this near complete reaction progress is evident from: high δ 34 S values of remaining SO 42 − (up to + 71. 8 ‰), high dissolved sulfide concentrations (3 ̆e 32 mg/L as S 2 −) with δ 34 S values that take on the approximate isotopic signature of the total dissolved S (mean + 17. 4 ‰), and low δ 13 C values of additional DIC derived from methane (as low as − 30 ‰). Thus the unique hydrogeology of the Cerna Valley allows the observation of two end-members of TSR (energy- and sulfate-limited) demonstrating wide boundary conditions of stable isotopic composition of dissolved S and C produced by TSR in a single natural system...|$|R

40|$|The Richat {{structure}} (Sahara, Mauritania) {{appears as}} a large dome at least 40 km in diameter within a Late Proterozoic to Ordovician sequence. Erosion has created circular cuestas represented by three nested rings dipping outward from the structure. The center of the structure consists of a limestone-dolomite shelf that encloses a kilometer-scale siliceous breccia and is intruded by basaltic ring dikes, kimberlitic intrusions, and alkaline volcanic rocks. Several hypotheses have been presented to explain the spectacular Richat structure and breccia, but their origin remains enigmatic. The breccia body is lenticular in shape and irregularly thins at its extremities to only a few meters. The breccia was created during karst dissolution and collapse.

40|$|The Pozalagua Quarry in the Basque–Cantabrian Basin of {{northern}} Spain exposes a {{unique set of}} fault-associated dolomites that can be studied on a decametre scale. The dolomites developed along the Pozalagua Fault system in slope-deposited limestones of Albian age. Following marine phreatic diagenesis, the limestones were subject to meteoric karst formation. The resulting cavities were filled either by angular limestone fragments in a black clay-rich matrix, or by cave floor/pond (now dolomitized) sediments. The subsequent diagenetic history reflects repeated periods of fracturing, fluid expulsion, dissolution and cementation. Contrasting fluid pulses resulted in the formation of a network of <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>karst</b> and the subsequent development of coarse-crystalline calcite cement, zebra dolomite, recrystallized coarse-crystalline dolomite, elongated blue–grey coarsecrystalline dolomite cement in the open fault and, finally, coarse-crystalline saddle dolomite. Decimetre-size reworked host-rock fragments present in the latter two dolomite phases probably reflect roof collapse fragments of a cave system that developed along the Pozalagua Fault system. However, there are also metre-scale host-rock fragments that apparently ‘float’ in the coarsecrystalline saddle dolomites, implying that either fragment assimilation was a widespread process or violent expulsion of fluids occurred along the Pozalagua Fault system. The presence of pre-dolomite and post-dolomite stylolites, parallel to bedding, supports a linkage between the diagenetic events and the Late Albian tectonism that affected the region. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Karstification of the Carboniferous Limestone of the {{northern}} part of the Derbyshire limestone outcrop began to a limited extent prior to deposition of the Namurian, and continued in some areas with the development of a <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>karst</b> system during the mineralisation phases of the Permo-Triassic. Extensive cavernisation by allogenic streams and by percolating meteoric water began after the final stripping of the cover of younger rocks during the late Tertiary, and the cave systems were extended and modified throughout the Pleistocene, A complex series of erosional events, apparently related to successive glacial phases, gave rise to a series of abandoned cave levels in some areas. The cavities produced during the Permo- Triassic were of importance in determining the nature and orientation of the later karst drainage systems. Where such pre-existing cavity systems failed to correspond with the hydraulic gradients of the Pleistocene, bedding controlled tube networks developed at preferred horizons in the limestone, often where a fossil horizon gave a relatively higher primary permeability and an underlying clay 'wayboard' arrested downward percolation. Interbedded impermeable horizons are important in the development of perched groundwater areas. Where such horizons have been breached they often form the upper limits of large caverns, since oxidation of sulphide minerals which they contain has locally increased the aggressiveness of circulating groundwater. The concentration of large cave systems near the margins of the present outcrop suggests that stripping of the cover during the late Tertiary occurred fast, and was completed prior to the establishment of significant hydraulic gradients within the limestone...|$|E

The Pb - Zn - Ba - F deposits of the Southern Pennine Orefield comprise stratabound rakes, pipes, and flats which are developed exclusively in Lower Carboniferous (Dinantian) Limestones and dolomites lying on a basement of Lower Palaeozoic rocks. The distribution of these deposits is largely controlled by the occurrence of favourable lithofacies, located on structural highs, in the uppermost (Brigantian stage) shelf limestones. These include pseudobreccias, shell beds, reefs, stylolitically-bedded limestones, erosion surfaces, and coarse crinoidal biosparrudites. A number of other lithologies acted as aquicludes and include lavas, tuffs, clay wayboards, shale, and chert beds. A review of studies of paragenesis, fluid inclusions, and isotopes has shown the mineralisation probably originated by deep circulation of connate Dinantian waters which leached base metals, barium, and fluorine, from a variety of crustal rocks. Deep seated sources provided sulphur in some of the sulphide minerals whose origin was related to crustal rifting in the area during the opening of the North Atlantic and the formation of the North Sea Basin. The mineral solutions were acidic and produced a system of integrated <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>karst</b> cavities known as pipes.
