5|$|He {{started his}} {{professional}} football career at Lumezzane and {{played for the}} first team twice before having an unsuccessful trial at Barcelona, and subsequently joining Internazionale in 2007. Inter manager Roberto Mancini brought Balotelli into the first team, but when Mancini left, Balotelli's <b>disciplinary</b> record fell away. He had a strained relationship with new manager José Mourinho and was suspended from Inter's first team in January 2009 {{after a number of}} <b>disciplinary</b> problems.|$|E
5|$|It {{was found}} that Choor Singh had two private {{contacts}} with a material witness {{in the course of}} the <b>disciplinary</b> proceedings, even though it is a well-established rule that a decision-maker should not have contact with any party to the proceedings or any of his witnesses in the absence of the other party or his counsel. The High Court found that there was no actual bias, but there was evidence on which reasonable people might believe that Choor Singh might or could not bring an unprejudiced mind to the <b>disciplinary</b> inquiry. The key finding was that the two private contacts with the material witness gave an appearance of a real likelihood of bias. On this basis, the High Court gave the order and quashed the finding of the <b>disciplinary</b> committee. The case was reported as Re Singh Kalpanath (1992).|$|E
5|$|Re Lim Chor Pee, {{ex parte}} Law Society of Singapore (1985) {{is another example}} of a case where a {{mandatory}} order was granted by the High Court. The appellant, Lim Chor Pee, who was an advocate and solicitor, had been convicted of several income tax offences and had been found to have tampered with a witness. On 16 July 1982, the Attorney-General wrote to the President of the Law Society of Singapore, providing information on the appellant's conviction and other records. Following a report by the Society's Inquiry Committee that a formal inquiry into the appellant's conduct was necessary, a <b>Disciplinary</b> Committee was appointed. The appellant successfully applied to the <b>Disciplinary</b> Committee to delete certain paragraphs of the statement of case which had been formulated against him by the Council of the Law Society, on the ground that the facts in those paragraphs did not appear in the Inquiry Committee's report. Consequently, three of the six charges against the appellant and a major portion of one other charge did not require investigation by the <b>Disciplinary</b> Committee. Dissatisfied with this decision, the Law Society applied to the High Court for an order of mandamus to direct the <b>Disciplinary</b> Committee to hear and investigate all the six charges against the appellant. The High Court granted the application, holding that under the Legal Profession Act, the Inquiry Committee's only function was to consider the matters before it and decide whether or not there should be a formal investigation by a <b>Disciplinary</b> Committee. It was the duty of the Council of the Law Society to draw up the charges, and the duty of the <b>Disciplinary</b> Committee to hear and investigate the charges properly before the Committee in the statement of case. Thus, the appellant could not object that some of the charges against him were based on facts not mentioned in the Inquiry Committee's report. The decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.|$|E
5|$|The F-FDTL has {{suffered}} from serious morale and <b>disciplinary</b> problems since its establishment. These problems have been driven by uncertainty over the F-FDTL's role, poor conditions of service due to limited resources, tensions arising from FALINTIL's transition from a guerrilla organisation to a regular military and political and regional rivalries. The F-FDTL's morale and <b>disciplinary</b> problems have resulted in large numbers of soldiers being disciplined or dismissed. The East Timorese Government was aware of these problems before the 2006 crisis but did not rectify the factors that were contributing to low morale.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the duty to act fairly varies greatly from case to case. Basic norms of {{fairness}} {{in the conduct of}} <b>disciplinary</b> proceedings need to be observed more strictly where the vocational future of a person is at stake, where there is an express duty on an association to make a decision only after conducting a hearing or an inquiry, and where the exercise of <b>disciplinary</b> powers may deprive a person of his or her property rights or impose a penalty on him or her.|$|E
5|$|Following the Olympics, Brooks was {{expelled}} from the Australian Institute of Sport by Don Talbot for <b>disciplinary</b> reasons. He accepted a swimming scholarship at the University of Arkansas, where he enjoyed the more liberal <b>disciplinary</b> standards. He returned to Australia for the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane and again raised the ire of officials during a preparatory training camp. After lobbying for improved accommodation conditions, Brooks {{was involved in a}} physical altercation with the team manager. As a result, he was given a suspension that was to take effect after the Commonwealth Games. However, his teammates protested and threatened to walk out, resulting in the ban being rescinded. Despite the turbulent preparation, Brooks had a successful meet, winning the 100m freestyle and anchoring the 4100m freestyle and medley relays to gold medals. Brooks competed at his second Olympics in Los Angeles in 1984 Games, where he won silver in the 4100m freestyle relay and bronze for swimming the heats of the medley relay. Brooks' international career ended at the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh with silver in the 100m freestyle and gold in the freestyle relay. Brooks retired after being suspended for his drinking binge during the return trip. He later became a swimming commentator but was sacked in 1998 after a <b>disciplinary</b> incident.|$|E
5|$|Further protests {{broke out}} in June 2012, this time from the Bolivian police, who objected to {{government}} reforms designed to combat widespread corruption in the force. Police broke into their own offices to burn all <b>disciplinary</b> case records, and demanded salary increases. Morales' government relented, cancelling many of the proposed reforms and agreeing to the salary increase.|$|E
5|$|Gray's Inn and {{the other}} three Inns of Court remain the only bodies legally allowed to call a {{barrister}} to the Bar, allowing him or her to practise in England and Wales. Although the Inn was previously a <b>disciplinary</b> and teaching body, these functions are now shared between the four Inns, with the Bar Standards Board (a division of the General Council of the Bar) acting as a <b>disciplinary</b> body and the Inns of Court and Bar Educational Trust providing education. The Inn remains a collegiate self-governing, unincorporated association of its members, providing within its precincts library, dining, residential and office accommodation (chambers), along with a chapel. Members of the Bar from other Inns may use these facilities to some extent.|$|E

5|$|Kartik was {{selected}} in 2000 {{for the first}} intake of the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore, after earlier having made his Test debut in early 2000 in a home series against South Africa. However, his stay was cut short along with that of Harbhajan, when they were expelled by the director Hanumant Singh over <b>disciplinary</b> issues.|$|E
5|$|Nan Chiau High School {{is known}} for its strict {{regulations}} and discipline, with minimal tolerance to misbehaviour of its students. In 2004 the school gained attention for its <b>disciplinary</b> action on a student over misconduct, which was deemed overly harsh. This came despite the backing of many alumni, educators and parents stressing that the action taken was justified.|$|E
5|$|Pollard was at {{the center}} of a small brawl with the San Francisco 49ers in their game on September 28, 1953. The brawl erupted in the fourth quarter, when San Francisco's Charley Powell squared off against Pollard. The Eagles ended up losing 31-21, and Pollard {{received}} no <b>disciplinary</b> action, although Powell was ejected.|$|E
5|$|Published on September 22, 2015, {{the fourth}} book, A Shiloh Christmas, was {{published}} by Atheneum, which printed 200,000 copies. A ferocious drought strikes Marty's community, and a new pastor joins blaming remorseless sinners for instigating it. Looking for a scapegoat, community members lie the responsibility squarely on people like Judd, an alcoholic and animal abuser who has reformed. A fire ravages multiple houses, including Judd's, prompting Marty and his family to help the homeowners reconstruct their homes. One day, Marty and a friend stumble upon Rachel, the pastor's daughter, confined to the pastor's toolshed. The incident forces Marty's parents {{to determine whether the}} <b>disciplinary</b> action has crossed the line from being <b>disciplinary</b> to being abusive. The book ends with characters who have vehemently differing views having a therapeutic Christmas meal together.|$|E
5|$|The Faculty of Arts and Humanities {{was formed}} in 1989 {{following}} the amalgamation of the faculties of Arts, Music and Theology. The faculty encompasses traditional <b>disciplinary</b> subjects, as well as less-common subjects such as Hellenic, Portuguese and Medieval Studies, and emerging disciplines such as Digital Humanities and Queer Studies.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial Counselor's chief {{duty was}} to conduct <b>disciplinary</b> {{procedures}} for officials. He shared similar duties with the Chancellor, such as receiving annual provincial reports. However, when his title {{was changed to}} Minister of Works in 8 BC, his chief duty became oversight of public works projects.|$|E
5|$|The Law Society asked Coopers & Lybrand {{to produce}} {{a report on the}} Law Society, which {{included}} its <b>disciplinary</b> topics among the areas to be reported on. The draft report, published in 1984, recommended that the Law Society should transfer its <b>disciplinary</b> processes to an independent Solicitor's Complaints Board, which would be made up of both solicitors and lay people (although with a majority of its members being solicitors). In 1985 the National Consumer Council published a survey showing that only 15% of respondents felt that the Law Society should be investigating complaints, and only 5% felt that if an independent body was created it should contain a solicitor majority, with 36% wanting equal representation of solicitors and lay people and 55% preferring a majority of lay people.|$|E

5|$|The first lengthy {{report of}} torture by the Chicago police was {{published}} beginning in January 1990 {{in the alternative}} weekly Chicago Reader. Through that year, as additional material was published by the Chicago Tribune, civil activists and victims of Burge pushed for <b>disciplinary</b> action against the officer.|$|E
5|$|A {{dispute over}} the {{composition}} of a Surrey side chosen to play a high-profile game in 1909, after several professional players were omitted for <b>disciplinary</b> reasons, led to an increasingly bitter argument between Crawford and the Surrey authorities. Crawford was told he had no future with the club, and moved to Australia. There, {{he worked as a}} teacher and continued his cricket career with South Australia. This arrangement had a controversial end, when he clashed with the South Australian Cricket Association over money and moved to New Zealand to play for Otago.|$|E
5|$|A. Belarusian athletes Vadim Devyatovskiy and Ivan Tsikhan, who won {{silver and}} bronze {{respectively}} in the men's hammer throw, both {{tested positive for}} abnormal levels of testosterone. After attending a <b>disciplinary</b> hearing in September, they were stripped of their medals on December 11, 2008. Krisztián Pars of Hungary was given the silver medal, and Koji Murofushi of Japan was given the bronze. On June 10, 2010, following a successful appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, Devyatovskiy and Tsikhan had their medals reinstated.|$|E
5|$|After a touch-line {{argument}} with then-club captain Gareth Owen, Gannon gave a forthright interview explaining that <b>disciplinary</b> {{action would be}} taken, and Owen would be stripped of the captaincy. Owen, who was later released by the club, did not play another game for County. Meanwhile, Gannon was left threatening police action over a strong challenge that left Stockport striker Matty McNeil unconscious and in hospital.|$|E
5|$|After {{his release}} from prison in 2010, Chen was placed under house arrest against Chinese law, and was closely {{monitored}} by security forces. Legally, he was proclaimed {{by the government to}} be a free man, but in reality the local government offered no explanation for the hundreds of unidentified agents monitoring his house and preventing visitors or escape. The national propaganda organ, the Global Times, expressed confusion over the issue, and suggested that the local government may not know how to handle it, but no <b>disciplinary</b> action was taken at the national level.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{sentence}} meted {{to him was}} eventually reduced, the corruption case had left permanent damage on Knight's career as a civil servant. After investigations on him began in March 1991, he faced <b>disciplinary</b> hearings and his services were terminated on 26 March 1992. The President also revoked the prestigious Public Administration Medal, Gold, that had been awarded to Knight. In August 1994, the High Court struck Knight off the roll of advocates and solicitors, meaning that {{he could no longer}} practise law. After being disbarred, Knight worked as a consultant in a public-listed company.|$|E
5|$|Back in Washington, both Scully and Mulder {{report to}} Section Chief McGrath, {{who does not}} believe their claims. McGrath offers an {{especially}} harsh reprimand to Mulder, and presents written testimony by Henderson claiming that Max's {{body was found in}} a cargo container. McGrath and his <b>disciplinary</b> board decide to shut down the X-Files and dismiss Mulder from the FBI, but the decision is vetoed by Deep Throat, who feels it would be more dangerous for them to allow Mulder to turn whistleblower than to let him continue his work.|$|E

Krisztián Pars of Hungary was given the silver medal, and Koji Murofushi of Japan was given the bronze. However, both of the Belarusian athletes had their medals reinstated because the doping tests weren't handled properly.|$|E
5|$|Biogeography (an {{amalgamation}} {{of biology}} and geography) is the {{comparative study of}} the geographic distribution of organisms and the corresponding evolution of their traits in space and time. The Journal of Biogeography was established in 1974. Biogeography and ecology share many of their <b>disciplinary</b> roots. For example, the theory of island biogeography, published by the Robert MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson in 1967 {{is considered one of}} the fundamentals of ecological theory.|$|E
5|$|Blount called Hout and Petersen to {{apologize}} on September 5. Kelly {{participated in the}} calls.

5|$|By late 1943, Miller {{was based}} in Gloucestershire. One night, he {{threatened}} to punch his commanding officer, resulting in his being sentenced for insubordination to a three-week <b>disciplinary</b> course with hard labour. In mid-November, he was posted to Ouston near Newcastle-upon-Tyne where he trained in the used of radar. During his stay there, Miller sustained a back injury during a wrestling match: the injury was to cause him recurring and enduring problems, particularly diminishing his ability to bowl.|$|E
5|$|By the 4th {{century the}} Roman {{province}} of Britannia was converted to Christianity {{and had even}} produced its own heretic in Pelagius. Britain sent three bishops to the Synod of Arles in 314, and a Gaulish bishop went to the island in 396 to help settle <b>disciplinary</b> matters. Lead baptismal basins and other artefacts bearing Christian symbols testify to a growing Christian presence at least until about 360.|$|E
5|$|He {{started his}} career with Crewe Alexandra in 2003, and made 133 league and cup {{appearances}} {{over the next five}} years. In 2008, he had a loan spell at Yeovil Town, before he joined the club permanently the following year. He signed with Rotherham United in November 2009, having impressed on trial, before he was released in summer 2010. Crewe, Yeovil and Rotherham all cited <b>disciplinary</b> problems as their reason for letting him go. He joined Port Vale in July 2010, having been handed a 'last chance' by manager Micky Adams. His contract was terminated in December 2011, again due to a <b>disciplinary</b> issue, and he signed with Mansfield Town. In January 2013 he joined Maltese club Floriana on loan.

He returned to Malta with Mosta in January 2015, coming back to England later in the year to play for Witton Albion. He joined Welsh club Bangor City in June 2016, and then switched to Southport in July 2017.|$|E
5|$|Improved {{standards}} of justice within prisons involving the giving {{of reasons to}} a prisoner for any decision which materially and adversely affects him; a grievance procedure and <b>disciplinary</b> proceedings which ensure that the Governor deals with most matters under his present powers; relieving Boards of Visitors of their adjudicatory role; and providing for final access to an independent Complaints Adjudicator.|$|E
5|$|In December 2012, Balotelli {{decided to}} fight against Manchester City's {{decision}} to fine him two weeks' wages for his poor <b>disciplinary</b> record the previous season by taking his club to a Premier League tribunal.

5|$|In {{its first}} two incarnations the office {{performed}} mostly secretarial work. The post of Responsible Secretary was then established in 1919 to perform administrative work. In 1922, the office of General Secretary followed as a purely administrative and <b>disciplinary</b> position, whose role was to {{do no more than}} determine party membership composition. Stalin, its first incumbent, used the principles of democratic centralism to transform his office into that of party leader, and later leader of the Soviet Union.|$|E
