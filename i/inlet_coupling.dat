A {{need was}} {{identified}} to test multi–layer vacuum super insulation (MLVSI) used in cryogenic applications for hydrogen storage. The study {{focuses on the}} application of commercially available MLVSI to a locally patented liquid hydrogen cryogenic storage system. This led to an investigation {{of different types of}} multi–layer vacuum insulation configurations, as well as further research on tank <b>inlet</b> <b>coupling</b> configurations. It includes the manufacturing of a liquid nitrogen testing cryostat to be able to test and evaluate the system performance. The first set of tests was based on the development of an <b>inlet</b> <b>coupling</b> configuration to limit heat transfer through the inner tank inlet, of a double cryogenic tank system in order to reduce gas boil–off. The couplings were manufactured {{in the form of a}} bellow to handle cryogenic vacuum levels, while ensuring low heat transfer rates between inner and outer tanks. It was found that various coupling designs can be considered to limit gas boil–off. The second set of tests was conducted on a specific MLVSI configuration to determine its effectiveness to insulate the spherical header surface of a typical hydrogen storage vessel. The installation procedure, to limit heat transfer and boil–off due to edge effects in this configuration was investigated. It was found that insulation–overlap–edge effects will always have an impact on insulation performance when a spherical header of a storage vessel is insulated, due to its specific geometry. A time efficient way to install MLVSI on such a spherical header is presented and evaluated. Further investigations were carried out by combining findings into one single system to determine the performance of an optimised insulated cryogenic system. It was found that copper plate discs installed between the vanes of a bellowed inlet/outlet nozzle is the most promising to limit heat transfer to the cryogenic fluid. Master...|$|E

40|$|A {{wind tunnel}} test program was {{conducted}} to acquire flow-field data during a supersonic propulsion system compressor stall and inlet unstart sequence. The propulsion system consisted of a mixed-compression, two-dimensional bifurcated <b>inlet</b> <b>coupled</b> to a General Electric J 85 - 13 turbojet engine. The propulsion system was mounted beneath a large flat plate that simulated an underwing propulsion pod installation. Transient flow-field pitot pressure and wing simulator surface static pressure data were acquired during multiple compressor stall and inlet unstart events at a free-stream Mach number of 2. 20. The experimental results obtained in this investigation indicate that a supersonic propulsion system compressor stall-inlet unstart transient event adversely affects the surrounding local flow field. The data show that the stall-unstart event affects the surrounding flow field on a millisecond time scale and causes a three-dimensional expanding wave front called a hammershock to propagate outward from the inlet. The flow nearest the wing simulator separates from the surface during the transient event.

40|$|Abstract-Exploiting {{the wind}} energy at low wind {{velocities}} {{is a major}} predicament in creating a sustainable energy resource for a country with inauspicious forthcoming energy crisis. Thus researching new and innovative systems to improve {{the efficiency of the}} wind turbines is an indispensable prerequisite. The scope of this paper concentrates on an approach to harness wind power by installing a conical shaped duct in front of the conventional turbine which is coupled with a generator. A solar panel has also been installed with the purpose of acquiring additional power supply. The reason for which a conical shaped duct is preferred is to get added wind velocity at the turbine inlet. The electrical power, obtained from the generator and solar panel are fed to the national grid. With the integration of solar panel and wind turbine more electrical power could be gained. A CFD simulation, utilizing ANSYS-CFX software, was eventually carried out to investigate the velocity profile at the inlet and outlet of the duct. The results obtained from the simulation could be employed to devise the conical shaped duct at the turbine <b>inlet</b> <b>coupled</b> with generator and solar photovoltaic cells...|$|R

40|$|Online {{monitoring}} of analytes in marine environments is receiving increased attention {{for a range}} of applications, including detection of pollutants in water. Major pollutants in water include volatile organic compounds (VOCs), dissolved gases and other naturally produced or anthropogenic toxic compounds. In addition to being a concern to environmental protection agencies, VOCs are also of interest to the oceanographic and atmospheric community as they are found to be important contributors to climate change, global warming and oxidant formation (smog). One of the well-established techniques for detecting traces of organic compounds in aqueous solutions is membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS). The technique is simple (no need for pre-connection), sensitive (detection limits are in the ppb range) and able to analyse multi-component mixtures simultaneously and in a few minutes. The aim of this research is to investigate, design, produce and test a novel, sensitive, fast, safe, state-of-art membrane <b>inlet</b> probe and <b>couple</b> this to an existing mass spectrometer so as to allow mass spectrometry in harsh or demanding environments as well as using the system for detection of volatile orgamc compounds in aqueous samples or monitoring trace organics in water. In this work, also a novel comprehensive approach for simulating MIMS systems by calculating spectral characteristics of toxic VOCs in water, such as benzene, toluene and chloroform is presented. For comparison to experimental data, MIMS system consists of a membrane sample <b>inlet,</b> <b>coupled</b> to a portable quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) system with m/z 1 - 200 mass range. The QMS is characterized for monitoring analyte concentrations from 1 - 1000 ppm. Using the multi-ion trajectory simulation program QMS- 2, developed by the University of Liverpool, the performance of the complete MIMS system including the membrane inlet probe and the QMS were simulated. The simulated results are compared with experimental ones showing good agreement for different analyte concentrations at room temperature.

40|$|A {{computational}} {{analysis of}} a Gulfstream isentropic external compression supersonic <b>inlet</b> <b>coupled</b> to a Rolls-Royce fan has been completed. The inlet was designed for a small, low sonic boom supersonic vehicle with a design cruise condition of M = 1. 6 at 45, 000 ft. The inlet design included an annular bypass duct that routed flow subsonically around an engine-mounted gearbox and diverted flow with high shock losses away from the fan tip. Two Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes codes {{were used for the}} analysis: an axisymmetric code called AVCS for the inlet and a three dimensional (3 -D) code called SWIFT for the fan. The codes were coupled at a mixing plane boundary using a separate code for data exchange. The codes were used to determine the performance of the inlet/fan system at the design point and to predict the performance and operability of the system over the flight profile. At the design point the core inlet had a recovery of 96 percent, and the fan operated near its peak efficiency and pressure ratio. A large hub radial distortion generated in the inlet was not eliminated by the fan and could pose a challenge for subsequent booster stages. The system operated stably at all points along the flight profile. Reduced stall margin was seen at low altitude and Mach number where flow separated on the interior lips of the cowl and bypass ducts. The coupled analysis gave consistent solutions at all points on the flight profile that would be difficult or impossible to predict by analysis of isolated components...|$|R
40|$|Background Poor feeding is {{a common}} cause of {{prolonged}} hospitalization of preterm infants. Pharyngeal and upper esophageal sphincter (UES) function of preterm infants has been technically difficult to assess and is therefore poorly characterized. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the development of pharyngeal motility, UES function, and their coordination during nutritive swallowing in preterm infants. Methods Development of swallowing was assessed in 18 preterm infants. High resolution manometry was performed at first oral feeding attempt (31 - 32 week) and then weekly for 4 weeks. Pharyngeal and UES pressure changes were characterized in 980 swallows. Key Results During swallowing, we observed an age-related decrease in peak pharyngeal pressure at the laryngeal inlet (1 cm above UES) but an age-related decrease in the time required for the UES to fully relax to nadir. Analysis of the timing of proximal pharyngeal contractile peak and UES nadir showed that the UES was not fully relaxed when bolus propulsive forces were at their peak in the youngest infants. Conclusions & Inferences Results show developmental changes in infant swallow physiology that can be clearly linked to the effectiveness of nutritive swallowing. Most preterm infants demonstrated poor pharyngeal pressures at the laryngeal <b>inlet</b> <b>coupled</b> with poor coordination of pharyngeal propulsion with UES relaxation. These pressure patterns were less efficient than those demonstrated by older infants who were more adept at feeding.

40|$|Trihalomethanes are {{predominantly}} formed during disinfection of water via {{reactions of the}} oxidant with natural organic matter. Even though chlorinated and brominated trihalomethanes are the most widespread organic contaminants in drinking water, when iodide is present in raw water iodinated trihalomethanes can also be formed. The formation of iodinated trihalomethanes can lead to taste and odor problems and is a potential health concern since they {{have been reported to}} be more toxic than their brominated or chlorinated analogs. Currently, there is no published standard analytical method for I-THMs in water. The analysis of 10 trihalomethanes in water samples in a single run is challenging because the iodinated trihalomethanes are found at very low concentrations (ng/L range), while the regulated chlorinated and brominated trihalomethanes are present at much higher concentrations (above μg/L). An automated headspace solid-phase microextraction technique, with a programmed temperature vaporizer <b>inlet</b> <b>coupled</b> with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, was developed for routine analysis of 10 trihalomethanes i. e. bromo-, chloro- and iodo-trihalomethanes in water samples.

The limits of detection range from 1 ng/L to 20 ng/L for iodoform and chloroform, respectively.

The two overriding goals of this research project are: to understand the relationship among the various instrumental components and operational parameters of the various ion sources and inlet systems under study, the chemical nature of the gases, solvents, and analytes in use, and the nature and abundances of the ions ultimately observed in the mass spectrometer; and to develop new and better analytical and fundamental applications of these ion sources and inlet systems or alternative sources and <b>inlets</b> <b>coupled</b> with mass spectrometry {{on the basis of}} the fundamental understanding obtained in Goal 1.

Five different inlet lengths were studied, ranging from 6. 4 to 1. 3 cm. As expected, the electrospray current transmission efficiency increased with decreasing capillary length due to reduced losses to the inside walls of the capillary. This increase in transmission efficiency with shorter <b>inlets</b> was <b>coupled</b> with reduced desolvation of electrosprayed droplets. Surprisingly, as the inlet length was decreased, some analytes showed little or no increase in sensitivity, while others showed as much as a 15 -fold gain.

40|$|Several {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) codes were {{used to analyze the}} Versatile Integrated Inlet Propulsion Aerodynamics Rig (VIIPAR) located at NASA Glenn Research Center. The rig consists of a serpentine inlet, a rake assembly, inlet guide vanes, a 12 -in. diameter tip-turbine driven fan stage, exit rakes or probes, and an exhaust nozzle with a translating centerbody. The analyses were done to develop computational capabilities for modeling inlet/fan interaction and to help interpret experimental data. Three-dimensional Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) calculations of the fan stage were used to predict the operating line of the stage, the effects of leakage from the turbine stream, and the effects of inlet guide vane (IGV) setting angle. Coupled axisymmetric calculations of a bellmouth, fan, and nozzle were used to develop techniques for coupling codes together and to investigate possible effects of the nozzle on the fan. RANS calculations of the serpentine <b>inlet</b> were <b>coupled</b> to Euler calculations of the fan to investigate the complete inlet/fan system. Computed wall static pressures along the inlet centerline agreed reasonably well with experimental data but computed total pressures at the aerodynamic interface plane (AIP) showed significant differences from the data. Inlet distortion was shown to reduce the fan corrected flow and pressure ratio, and was not completely eliminated by passage through the fa...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{investigation}} of vortex induced tail buffet is {{conducted on the}} F- 18 aircraft at high angles of attack. The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations are integrated using a time-accurate, implicit procedure. A generalized overset zonal grid scheme is used to decompose the computational space around the complete aircraft with faired-over <b>inlet.</b> A weak <b>coupling</b> between the aerodynamics and structures is assumed to compute the structural oscillation of the flexible vertical tail. Time-accurate computations of the turbulent flow around the F- 18 aircraft at 30 degrees angle of attack show the surface and off-surface flowfield details, including the unsteadiness created by the vortex burst and its interaction with the vertical twin tail which causes the tail buffet. The effect of installing a LEX fence on modifying the vortex structure upstream of the tail is also examined...|$|R
