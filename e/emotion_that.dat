Archie tells Janine that they should skip Christmas dinner as {{he has made a}} surprise treasure hunt for her. Janine eventually finds an envelope containing a one-way ticket to Poland and Archie throws her out onto the street telling her he knows how she and Ryan tried to double-cross him. Archie is visited by Jack who threatens to kill him if he hurts Ronnie again. Archie finds Ian searching his living room for the CD and Archie says it is on his laptop and he can make copies at any time, threatening Ian with a phone call to Jane, before ejecting him from the pub. Sam returns and attempts to confront Archie but he shuts the door on her. Ronnie then arrives and tells him with no <b>emotion</b> <b>that</b> he will not make her care for him and she would not care if he died. Archie throws her out onto the street reminding her that it was the exact spot she pushed Danielle onto the night she died.|$|E

25|$|The final affective {{response}} or emotion seen in initial infidelity is anger (Johnson, 2017). Anger is an <b>emotion</b> <b>that</b> is felt in {{all stages}} of infidelity, but in different ways and at different calibers. In {{the initial stages of}} infidelity anger is an underlying <b>emotion</b> <b>that</b> is usually exposed after the buildup of other emotions such as jealousy and resentment. When a partner is suspicious of another’s intentions and actions they become frustrated with that partner and tend to get angry at them more easily and feel that the anger is not anticipated. In turn, the suspected unfaithful partner will be confused and become angry at the other starting fight. Anger is noticed to be a key emotion within a situation like infidelity, it takes on many roles and forms throughout the process but in the initial stage of cheating anger can be an affective emotion because of how unpredictable and rapid it can happen without thinking of one’s actions and feelings before doing so.|$|E

The Methodists, however, adopted and eventually domesticated camp meetings and introduced them into the eastern United States, where for decades they were one of the evangelical signatures of the denomination.|$|E

25|$|The poem {{suggests}} that acting on anger reduces {{the need for}} vengeance, which may {{be connected to the}} British view of anger held following the start of the French Revolution. The revolutionary forces were commonly connected to the expression of anger with opposing sides arguing that the anger was either a motivating rationale or simply blinded an individual to reason. Blake, like Coleridge, believed that anger needed to be expressed, but both were wary of the type of <b>emotion</b> <b>that,</b> rather than guide, was able to seize control.|$|E

Caccini's preface includes musical examples of ornamentsfor example how a specific passage can be ornamented in several different ways, according to the precise <b>emotion</b> <b>that</b> the singer wishes to convey; it also includes effusive praise for the style and amusing disdain for the work of more conservative composers of the period.|$|E

25|$|Prominent {{blood vessels}} (telangiectasia) {{over the white}} (sclera) of the eyes usually occur {{by the age of}} 5–8 years, but {{sometimes}} later or not at all. The absence of telangiectasia does not exclude the diagnosis of A-T. Potentially a cosmetic problem, the ocular telangiectasia do not bleed or itch, though they are sometimes misdiagnosed as chronic conjunctivitis. It is their constant nature, not changing with time, weather or <b>emotion,</b> <b>that</b> marks them as different from other visible blood vessels. Telangiectasia can also appear on sun-exposed areas of skin, especially the face and ears. They occur in the bladder as a late complication of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, have been seen deep inside the brain of older people with A-T, and occasionally arise in the liver and lungs.|$|E
25|$|His first {{attempts}} at film direction had limited success, {{and he left}} Denmark {{to work in the}} French film industry. While living in France he met Jean Cocteau, Jean Hugo {{and other members of the}} French artistic scene and in 1928 he made his first classic film, The Passion of Joan of Arc. Working from the transcripts of Joan's trial, he created a masterpiece of <b>emotion</b> <b>that</b> drew equally on realism and expressionism. Dreyer used private finance from Baron Nicolas de Gunzburg to make his next film as the Danish film industry was in financial ruin. Vampyr (1932) is a surreal meditation on fear. Logic gave way to mood and atmosphere in this story of a man protecting two sisters from a vampire. The movie contains many indelible images, such as the hero, played by de Gunzburg (under the screen name Julian West), dreaming of his own burial and the animal blood lust on the face of one of the sisters as she suffers under the vampire's spell. The film was shot mostly silent but with sparse, cryptic dialogue in three separate versions – English, French and German.|$|E
25|$|Malfatti's studies {{began in}} Mackenzie College in São Paulo, but the limited world {{of art in}} Brazil {{was not enough to}} satiate her curious mind and so she left for Berlin in 1912. Europe still {{remained}} an extremely important agent in defining artistic tendencies during this era. Hence, when Anita Malfatti went to Germany and studied with important artists Fritz Burger-Muhlfeld (1867–1927), Lovis Corinth (1858–1925) and Ernst Bischoff-Culm her influences and creative exposure were inflated. During this period she studied German Expressionism. German Expressionism emphasized the color pallette and artists were expected to paint with expressive amounts of <b>emotion</b> <b>that</b> was emphasized and where subjects of the work were frequently altered or jarred. A huge influence in her artistic style lay in her exposure to the Armory Show in Cologne from May to September 1912. At the show a conglomeration of artists were exposed. Although there were many post-impressionist painters exhibited, Cubism stole the show by far. Homer Boss was included in the show and Malfatti went to study with him in New York in 1915. Malfatti also studied under artists George Bridgman, Dimitri Romanoffsky (s.d.-1971), however it was her experience with Homer Boss at the Independent School of Art that was most influential. Homer Boss was a huge impact on Malfatti's style because of his comprehensive studies of the human anatomy. He stressed the idea of understanding the muscular body which helped Malfatti to hone her own technique. New York was central in celebrating Cubism and Malfatti was an exceptional student within the Independent School of Art. Thus she was exposed to European style, which by the early twentieth centuries was even being forged with other styles. Europe's views on Modernism included a subjective treatment toward subjects as well as a highly repellent attitude towards the artistic movements proceeding modernism such as Realism or Romanticism. Malfatti’s exposure to the European world of art allowed her a glimpse into an artistic world that she could never have known in São Paulo and gave her the more global viewpoint that she would pass on to other artists as well.|$|E
