5|$|Dopamine (DA, a {{contraction}} of 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine) is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families that plays several important roles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> and body. It is an amine synthesized by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of its precursor chemical L-DOPA, which is synthesized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> and kidneys. Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most animals.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain,</b> AVMs {{occasionally}} exert pressure, {{leading to}} headaches. They may {{also increase the}} risk of seizures, as would any abnormal tissue <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b> Finally, hemorrhage from an AVM may lead to intracerebral hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain), which causes any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness in part of the body or difficulty speaking. If the bleeding occurs into the subarachnoid space (subarachnoid hemorrhage), there is usually a severe, sudden headache and decreased level of consciousness and often weakness in part of the body.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the efficacy of}} clindamycin in a murine model of toxoplasmic encephalitis using direct intracerebral inoculation. Clindamycin reduced mortality from 40 % in normal mice and 100 % in cortisone-treated mice to 0 % in both groups. Although {{we were unable to}} document appreciable levels of clindamycin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of infected mice, the histological features of cerebral infection were markedly altered. The formation of large numbers of cysts and the intense inflammatory response seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of normal mice and the unchecked infection and tissue necrosis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of cortisone-treated mice were absent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of clindamycin-treated mice. Enumeration of cysts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of mice 10 weeks after infection revealed a significantly lower number <b>in</b> <b>the</b> clindamycin-treated mice. Spread of infection to other organs was also decreased during clindamycin administration. These observations suggest that clindamycin may have a role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> therapy of toxoplasmic encephalitis...|$|R

5|$|A normal {{variation}} in the PRNP gene can modify {{the course of the}} disease by delaying the age of onset and affecting the type of symptoms that develop.

A role for the ApoE gene was initially suspected but could not be confirmed.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, {{just under}} 20,000 protein-coding genes {{are seen to}} be {{expressed}} in the human, and some 400 of these genes are brain-specific. The data that has been provided on gene expression <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> has fuelled further research {{into a number of}} disorders. The long term use of alcohol for example, has shown altered gene expression <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain,</b> and cell-type specific changes that may relate to alcohol use disorder. These changes have been noted in the synaptic transcriptome in the prefrontal cortex, and are seen as a factor causing the drive to alcohol dependence, and also to other substance abuses.|$|E

40|$|PrPSc {{is formed}} from a normal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored prion protein (PrPC) by a posttranslational modification. Most GPI-anchored {{proteins}} {{have been shown}} to be cleaved by GPI phospholipases. Recently, GPI-phospholipase D (GPI-PLD) was shown to be a strictly specific enzyme for GPI anchors. To investigate the involvement of GPI-PLD <b>in</b> <b>the</b> processes of neurodegeneration in prion diseases, we examined the mRNA and protein expression levels of GPI-PLD <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of a prion animal model (scrapie), and <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> and cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) of sporadic and familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) patients. We found that compared with controls, the expression of GPI-PLD was dramatically down-regulated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of scrapie-infected mice, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> caveolin-enriched membrane fractions. Interestingly, <b>the</b> observed decrease <b>in</b> GPI-PLD expression levels began at the same time that PrPSc began to accumulate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> infected <b>brains</b> and this decrease was also observed <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> and CSF of CJD patients; however, no differences in expression were observed <b>in</b> either <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> or CSF specimens from Alzheimer's disease patients. Taken together, these results suggest that the down-regulation of GPI-PLD protein may be involved in prion propagation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of prion diseases...|$|R

5|$|Several {{complications}} {{can occur}} {{as a result of}} SCSFLS including decreased cranial pressure, brain herniation, infection, blood pressure problems, transient paralysis, and coma.

5|$|The {{brains of}} all species are {{composed}} primarily of two broad classes of cells: neurons and glial cells.

5|$|The {{individual}} animals need {{to express}} survival-promoting behaviors, such as seeking food, water, shelter, and a mate. The motivational system <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> monitors {{the current state}} of satisfaction of these goals, and activates behaviors to meet any needs that arise. The motivational system works largely by a reward–punishment mechanism. When a particular behavior is followed by favorable consequences, the reward mechanism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> is activated, which induces structural changes inside the brain that cause the same behavior to be repeated later, whenever a similar situation arises. Conversely, when a behavior is followed by unfavorable consequences, the brain's punishment mechanism is activated, inducing structural changes that cause the behavior to be suppressed when similar situations arise in the future.|$|E

At the terminal stage of infection, TNF-α and IFN-γ transcripts were coexpressed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brains</b> of four of five animals with SIV encephalitis (SIVE). Within an encephalitic brain, TNF-α and IFN-γ transcripts were detected in six of seven regions with histologic evidence of SIVE, suggesting a direct relationship between neuropathology and altered cytokine gene expression. With combined fluorescent in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence, TNF-α-expressing cells were frequently identified as CD 68 -positive macrophages within perivascular lesions.

5|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{reported}} an age-related decline in dopamine synthesis and dopamine receptor density (i.e., the number of receptors) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b> This decline has been shown to occur in the striatum and extrastriatal regions.C]DOPA |journal=Life Sciences |volume=79 |issue=8 |pages=730–736 |doi=10.1016/j.lfs.2006.02.017 |pmid=16580023 }} Decreases in the D1, D2, and D3 receptors are well documented. The reduction of dopamine with aging is thought to be responsible for many neurological symptoms that increase in frequency with age, such as decreased arm swing and increased rigidity. Changes in dopamine levels may also cause age-related changes in cognitive flexibility.|$|E
5|$|A study {{published}} in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the flavour of beer alone could provoke dopamine activity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> of the male participants, who wanted to drink more as a result.

Test results indicated that the flavour of the beer triggered a dopamine release, even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.|$|E
