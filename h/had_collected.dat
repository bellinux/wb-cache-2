In 1939, Reginald Innes Pocock combined all slow lorises into a single species, Nycticebus coucang.|$|E
5|$|A {{visit to}} Cornwall in 1746–1747, {{where he met}} the antiquary and naturalist William Borlase, awakened an {{interest}} in minerals and fossils which formed his main scientific study during the 1750s. In 1750, his account of an earthquake at Downing was inserted in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, where there also appeared in 1756 a paper on several coralloid bodies he <b>had</b> <b>collected</b> at Coalbrookdale, Shropshire. More practically, Pennant used his geological knowledge to open a lead mine, which helped to finance improvements at Downing after he had inherited the estate in 1763.|$|E

5|$|Betances, who <b>had</b> <b>collected</b> {{more money}} in France for the Party than the plan's {{potential}} cost, grew weary of the Cuban revolutionary movement's diminishing support of the Puerto Rico independence cause.

At least two of them insulted him publicly, and even took advantage of Simplicia Jiménez's mental health to have her harass her husband systematically.|$|E

5|$|Brown <b>had</b> <b>collected</b> seventy-seven osteoderms while {{excavating}} a Tyrannosaurus specimen in the Lance Formation of Wyoming in 1900. He mentioned these osteoderms (specimen AMNH 5866) in {{his description}} of Ankylosaurus, but thought they belonged to the Tyrannosaurus instead. Paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn also expressed this view when he described the Tyrannosaurus specimen as the now invalid genus Dynamosaurus in 1905. Later examination has shown them {{to be similar to}} those of Ankylosaurus, and that Brown had compared them with some Euoplocephalus osteoderms, which had been erroneously catalogued as belonging to Ankylosaurus at the AMNH.|$|E
5|$|Gosse <b>had</b> <b>collected</b> the British Museum {{specimen}} of Oryzomys antillarum in 1845, {{but may not}} have separated it from introduced rats found with it. Coues noted that the two USNM specimens he examined were received after he had written the preceding part of his monograph; later, Thomas and others wrote that these specimens were obtained around 1877, but Ray asserted that they were taken before 1874. No specimens have been collected since.|$|E
