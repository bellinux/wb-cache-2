25|$|<b>Equivalent</b> <b>airspeed</b> (EAS) {{is defined}} as the speed at sea level that would produce the same {{incompressible}} dynamic pressure as the true airspeed at the altitude at which the vehicle is flying. An aircraft in forward flight is subject to the effects of compressibility. Likewise, the calibrated airspeed {{is a function of the}} compressible impact pressure. EAS, on the other hand, is a measure of airspeed that is a function of incompressible dynamic pressure.

40|$|To {{test whether}} wing shape affects the {{kinematics}} of wing motion during bird flight, we recorded high-speed video (250 Hz) of four species flying in a variable-speed wind tunnel. The birds flew at intervals of 2 m s− 1, ranging from 1 m s− 1 {{up to their}} respective maximum flight speed, which varied from 14 to 17 m s− 1 depending on the species. Kinematic data obtained from two synchronized, high-speed video cameras were analyzed using 3 D reconstruction. Three species with relatively pointed, high-as-pect ratio wings changed wingbeat styles according to flight speed (budgerigar, Melopsittacus undulatus; cockatiel, Nymphicus hollandicus; ringed turtle dove, Strep-topelia risoria). These species used a wing-tip reversal upstroke, characterized by supination of the distal wing at mid-upstroke, at <b>equivalent</b> <b>airspeeds</b> 7 to 9 m s− 1. In faster flight, they used a swept-wing upstroke, without distal wing supination. At mid-upstroke at any speed, wingspan in these species was greater than wrist span. In contrast, at all steady flight speeds, the black-billed magpie Pica hudsonia with relatively broad, low-aspect ratio wings, used a flexed-wing, feathered upstroke in which wrist spans were {{equal to or greater}} than wingspans. Our results demonstrate that wing kinematics vary gradually as a function of flight speed, and that the patterns of variation are strongly influenced by external wing shape...|$|R
40|$|Flight {{speed is}} {{expected}} to increase with mass and wing loading among flying animals and aircraft for fundamental aerodynamic reasons. Assuming geometrical and dynamical similarity, cruising flight speed is predicted to vary as (body mass) (1 / 6) and (wing loading) (1 / 2) among bird species. To test these scaling rules and the general importance of mass and wing loading for bird flight speeds, we used tracking radar to measure flapping flight speeds of individuals or flocks of migrating birds visually identified to species as well as their altitude and winds at the altitudes where the birds were flying. <b>Equivalent</b> <b>airspeeds</b> (airspeeds corrected to sea level air density, Ue) of 138 species, ranging 0. 01 - 10 kg in mass, were analysed in relation to biometry and phylogeny. Scaling exponents in relation to mass and wing loading were significantly smaller than predicted (about 0. 12 and 0. 32, respectively, with similar results for analyses based on species and independent phylogenetic contrasts). These low scaling exponents {{may be the result of}} evolutionary restrictions on bird flight-speed range, counteracting too slow flight speeds among species with low wing loading and too fast speeds among species with high wing loading. This compression of speed range is partly attained through geometric differences, with aspect ratio showing a positive relationship with body mass and wing loading, but additional factors are required to fully explain the small scaling exponent of Ue in relation to wing loading. Furthermore, mass and wing loading accounted for only a limited proportion of the variation in Ue. Phylogeny was a powerful factor, in combination with wing loading, to account for the variation in Ue. These results demonstrate that functional flight adaptations and constraints associated with different evolutionary lineages have an important influence on cruising flapping flight speed that goes beyond the general aerodynamic scaling effects of mass and wing loading...|$|R

40|$|In a {{simultaneous}} paired approach to closely-spaced parallel runways, {{a pair of}} aircraft flies in close proximity on parallel approach paths. The longitudinal separation between the aircraft must be maintained within a range that avoids wake encounters and, {{if one of the}} aircraft blunders, avoids collision. To increase operational availability, the approach procedure must accommodate a mixture of aircraft sizes and, consequently, approach speeds. In these procedures, the slower aircraft is placed in the lead position. The faster aircraft maintains separation from the slow aircraft in a dependent operation until final approach and flies independently afterward. Due to the higher approach speed of the fast aircraft, longitudinal separation will decrease during final approach. Therefore, the fast aircraft must position itself before the final approach so that it will remain within the safe range of separation as separation decreases. Given the approach geometry and speed schedule for each aircraft, one can use kinematics to estimate the separation loss between a pair of aircraft. A kinematic model can complement fast-time Monte-Carlo simulations of the approach by enabling a tailored reduction in the variation of starting position for the fast aircraft.

The design of experiments (DOE) is an efficient procedure for planning experiments so that the data obtained can be analyzed to yield valid and objective conclusions. DOE begins with determining the objectives of an experiment and selecting the process factors for the study. An Experimental Design is the laying out of a detailed experimental plan in advance of doing the experiment. Well chosen experimental designs maximize the amount of "information" that can be obtained for a given amount of experimental effort. Design of experiments is thus a discipline that has very broad application across all the natural and social sciences and engineering. In this paper we present an experimental design problem as a Nash equilibrium problem {{in the context of}} Game Theory: the choice of two variables in n experiments is made by two players, each of them has to decide the location of his process variable far as possible from the opponent. This requirement allows to obtain a distribution of the points with high dispersion, in such a way to better explore all the available possible region, and can be interpreted as a particular non-cooperative game, a spatial competition, also known as Hotelling competition. The facility is identified with each single test point and the spatial domain corresponds to the admissible region. The optimal distribution is a Nash equilibrium solution of this game. In our model {{it turns out that the}} game has a peculiar structure, namely it is a potential game and the Nash equilibrium solutions will be the minimum points of a function that is called the potential function or potential in short. This aspect allow to prove existence results for the equilibrium solutions, and also to compute them by using a numerical procedure based on a genetic algorithm. A concrete application in aerospace engineering is discussed: the design of a test matrix in an envelope expansion flight test activity. We consider that the requirements of two different engineers categories can be formalized with two different objective functions. Structural Engineers, interested in assessment of aeroelastic properties, want to optimize distribution in Mach number and <b>equivalent</b> <b>airspeed</b> range (the latter being representative of dynamic pressure), while Systems Engineers, focused on environmental effects on the aircraft, want to optimize distribution in pressure altitude and <b>equivalent</b> <b>airspeed</b> range. We deal with an experiment with two design variables. Both categories of engineers share a common goal: exploring the entire envelope, thus distributing the test points as widely as possible in the flight envelope. We present the non-cooperative game facing this experimental design problem, together with existence and computational results...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of an}} {{evolutionary}} algorithm {{in the framework of}} H 1 control theory is being considered as a means for synthesizing controller gains that minimize a weighted combination of the infinite norm of the sensitivity function (for disturbance attenuation requirements) and complementary sensitivity function (for robust stability requirements) at the same time. The case study deals with a complete full-authority longitudinal control system for an unstable high-performance jet aircraft featuring (i) a stability and control augmentation system and (ii) autopilot functions (speed and altitude hold). Constraints on closed-loop response are enforced, that representing typical requirements on airplane handling qualities, that makes the control law synthesis process more demanding. Gain scheduling is required, in order to obtain satisfactory performance over the whole flight envelope, so that the synthesis is performed at different reference trim conditions, for several values of the dynamic pressure, used as the scheduling parameter. Nonetheless, the dynamic behaviour of the aircraft may exhibit significant variations when flying at different altitudes, even for the same value of the dynamic pressure, so that a trade-off is required between different feasible controllers synthesized at different altitudes for a given <b>equivalent</b> <b>airspeed.</b> A multiobjective search is thus considered for the determination of the best suited solution to be introduced in the scheduling of the control law. The obtained results are then tested on a longitudinal non-linear model of the aircraft...|$|E
