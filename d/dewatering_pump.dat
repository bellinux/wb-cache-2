50|$|Drawbacks to hand-dug wells are numerous. It can be {{impractical}} to hand dig {{wells in}} areas where hard rock is present, {{and they can be}} time-consuming to dig and line even in favourable areas. Because they exploit shallow aquifers, the well may be susceptible to yield fluctuations and possible contamination from surface water, including sewage. Hand dug well construction generally requires the use of a well trained construction team, and the capital investment for equipment such as concrete ring moulds, heavy lifting equipment, well shaft formwork, motorized de-watering pumps, and fuel can be large for people in developing countries. Construction of hand dug wells can be dangerous due to collapse of the well bore, falling objects and asphyxiation, including from <b>dewatering</b> <b>pump</b> exhaust fumes.|$|E
50|$|Wellpoints are small-diameter (about 50 mm) tubes with slots {{near the}} bottom that are {{inserted}} into the ground from which water is drawn by a vacuum generated by a <b>dewatering</b> <b>pump.</b> Wellpoints are typically installed at close centers in a line along or {{around the edge of}} an excavation. As a vacuum is limited to 0 bar, the height to which water can be drawn is limited to about 6 meters (in practice). Wellpoints can be installed in stages, with the first reducing the water level by up to five meters, and a second stage, installed at a lower level, lowering it further.The water trickling between the deep wells may be collected by a single row of well point at the toe. This method ensures a much thicker width free from seepage forces.|$|E

In 2011 {{the mining}} {{industry}} purchased 14. 5 % of the electrical energy generated by Eskom. During 2011 in South Africa, <b>dewatering</b> <b>pump</b> systems on gold mines were {{the fourth largest}} electrical energy consumer on South African mines therefor making dewatering pumps ideal candidates to generate significant financial savings. These savings can be realised by controlling time-of-use (TOU) schedules. Previous studies concentrated {{on the impact of}} improving a pumping scheme of a single mineshaft. This dissertation will focus on the operations of a complete dewatering system consisting of multiple mineshafts. The case study will consist of a gold mine complex comprising of five different shafts - each with its own reticulation system – as well as the larger interconnected water reticulation system. Various pumping options were investigated, simulated and verified. The interaction between shafts was determined when load-shifting was scheduled for all the shafts taking each shaft’s particular infrastructure into account. The underground dewatering system was automated and optimised based on the simulation results. Mine safety protocols were adhered to while optimal pump operational schedules were introduced.

40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Deep {{gold mines}} use {{a vast amount}} of water for various purposes. After use, the water is pumped back to the surface. This process is energy intensive. The control is {{traditionally}} done with manual interventions. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the effects of automated control on mine <b>dewatering</b> <b>pumps.</b> Automating mine <b>dewatering</b> <b>pumps</b> may hold a great number of benefits for the client. The benefits include electricity cost savings through load shifting, as well as preventative maintenance and pump protection procedures. By automating pumps, the client will benefit from operating more cost effectively and realising electricity cost savings. The equipment needed for pump automation and the procedures involved in the process are discussed as part of this study. A DSM project was implemented in the form of a pump automation project. All safety and quality procedures were followed and training was provided where needed to ensure that personnel understand their duties and responsibilities. This ensures the sustainability of the project after completion. The performance of the project was tested in manual mode, manual scheduled control, manual scheduled surface control and auto control. Manual intervention achieved the highest electricity cost saving of R 8. 25 million (11. 4 MW load shift saving). To achieve this saving the system was exhausted to a point where columns and infrastructure started failing. Auto intervention achieved an electricity cost saving of R 5. 57 million (7. 7 MW load shift savings). The auto intervention achieved a lower electricity cost savings compared to the manual intervention. However, taking all factors into account, such as the damage to infrastructure after a period of manual control, the auto intervention proved the best balance for controlling mine <b>dewatering</b> <b>pumps</b> to achieve savings on the cost of electricity and system sustainability for optimal control. Automated systems can avoid system overload and protect the infrastructure from exhaustion. Master...|$|R

40|$|The {{survival}} of Venice {{is threatened by}} the continuous increase of frequency and intensity of tidal floods. To prevent these events, a safeguarding system known as MOSE is under construction at the inlets of the Lagoon of Venice. Four arrays of mobile barriers will be lifted {{in the case of}} exceptionally high tides (> 1. 10 m) to insulate the Lagoon. The prefabrication of the mobile barriers required a large construction area close to the final installation sites. Given the lack of space in the inlets of Lido and Chioggia, two basins of the future navigation locks were used for this purpose, and a system of water pumps and wells was therefore installed in each site to ensure the accessibility and safety of the construction areas. The impact of dewatering on the aquifers on the mainland in Punta Sabbioni (inlet of Lido) was monitored by means of continuous hydraulic head measurements in a network 25 piezometers, 11 screened in the phreatic aquifer and 14 in the shallowest confined aquifer. These aquifers are separated by a 5 m thick clayey aquiclude, and a 30 m thick impervious layer isolates them from the underlying confined aquifers, which were therefore not monitored. Each monitoring well was equipped with an automatic water pressure transducer and the hourly recorded hydraulic heads were compensated with the barometric pressure. The time series were compared with the natural driving forces (tides, rainfall, evapotranspiration) and the anthropogenic impact sources (<b>dewatering</b> <b>pumping,</b> slurry walls, land reclamation channels). The dynamics of seawater intrusion were also studied through monthly measurements of the vertical profiles of the electrical conductivity (EC) of groundwater. The monitoring activity was successful in assessing the impacts of the construction works. A drawdown was observed in the confined aquifer due to the <b>dewatering</b> <b>pumping,</b> with a maximum displacement of some 5 m on the mainland and an extension of some 1000 m from the dewatered basin. By contrast, no impact was observed in the phreatic aquifer, proving that the combined insulation effect of the slurry wall and the aquiclude was successful in avoiding the depletion of this water body. At the end of the <b>dewatering</b> <b>pumping,</b> the confined aquifer fully recovered, returning to its pristine conditions in a few months. The EC measurements revealed that a de-salinization trend occurred in a portion of the phreatic aquifer, due to the presence of the slurry wall. The results of the monitoring programme brought some useful insights, that could also be applied to other groundwater monitoring programs in large construction works. The ante operam monitoring phase lasted for some 15 months, thus allowing a thorough understanding of the groundwater dynamics over more than an hydrological yearly cycle. A large area was covered to identify the impacted areas {{with a high level of}} precision. The short-term groundwater level dynamics have been revealed thanks to continuous measurements in all the monitored wells.

40|$|With {{respect to}} model {{parameterization}} and sensitivity analysis, this work uses a practical example {{to suggest that}} methods that start with simple models and use computationally frugal model analysis methods remain valuable in any toolbox of model development methods. In this work, groundwater model calibration starts with a simple parameterization that evolves into a moderately complex model. The model is developed for a water management study of the Tivoli- Guidonia basin (Rome, Italy) where surface mining has been conducted in conjunction with substantial dewatering. The approach to model development used in this work employs repeated analysis using sensitivity and inverse methods, including use of a new observation-stacked parameter importance graph. The methods are highly parallelizable and require few model runs, which make the repeated analyses and attendant insights possible. The success of a model development design can be measured by insights attained and demonstrated model accuracy relevant to predictions. Example insights were obtained: (1) A long-held belief that, {{except for a few}} distinct fractures, the travertine is homogeneous was found to be inadequate, and (2) The <b>dewatering</b> <b>pumping</b> rate is more critical to model accuracy than expected. The latter insight motivated additional data collection and improved pumpage estimates. Validation tests using three other recharge and pumpage conditions suggest good accuracy for the predictions considered.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{cessation}} of underground mining in the Lorraine iron ore basin and the stop of the <b>dewatering</b> <b>pumping</b> have induced a quick {{rise of the}} flooding level in the mine reservoir. In a particular sector, where the outcrops meet the Orne valley, this caused an appreciable rise in the water table in the underlying alluvial deposits related to the river. Then, infiltrations of water into the cellars of some 60 dwelling houses located in {{the lower part of}} a town have been observed. In order to control the hydraulic impact on surface buildings of the flooding of underground mine workings, with a view to designing an effective and permanent system, a number of field studies and investigations were carried out. These studies have shown the necessity to create a new overflowing point of the mine water reservoir. For this purpose, inverse modelling of the hydrological system consisting of the mine reservoir, the alluvial deposits aquifer and the Orne river, and a 3 D geological modelling of the existing mine workings have been developped. Original and new tools, completed by the inspection of the flooded mine with a remote operated véhicule, in order to illustrate and optimise the installation of the permanent gravity system necessary for lowering the water level in the mine reservoir, have been achieved. They have provided a satisfactory solution either technically or financially, even under the most severe hydrological conditions.

40|$|The {{impact of}} water in surface and {{underground}} mining activities is of great concern to Mining Engineers and Geoscientists {{to the effect that}} its accumulation in excess quantity can render mining of minerals ineffective. Surface and underground mines must therefore constantly be dewatered in order to forestall over-flooding and its attended effects on mining machinery, infrastructures industrial health, and productivity. In mine planning and design the cost of dewatering of mines is often captured as capital costs at the initial stage of mine development and afterwards in the cause of mining as operating costs both playing significant roles in profit or loss of Mining companies. Mines are often excavated below the water table where mine voids serve as low-pressure sinks inducing groundwater to move to the openings from the surrounding saturated rock. The result is the dewatering of nearby rock units via drainage of fractures and water-bearing strata in contact with the mine workings. There is also the potential for impacts to more remote water-bearing units and surface water bodies depending on the degree of hydrologic communication. The extent and severity of the impact on the local surface water and groundwater systems depends on the depth of the mine, the topographic and hydro-geologic setting, and the hydrologic characteristics of adjacent strata. The dewatering of mines and its cost implications starts from mineral exploration and mine development from where the rate of water flow is approximated thereby providing the initial clue to the choice of <b>dewatering</b> <b>pumps</b> and other drainage infrastructures. The paper dwells on the sources of water and its menace in surface and sub-surface mines, its control, and effects on the cost analysis of mineral investments...|$|R

40|$|The {{closure of}} {{individual}} coal mines usually entails a cessation of mine dewatering, which can {{give rise to}} {{significant changes in the}} local and regional hydrogeological regime. Where the last colliery in an entire coalfield closes, these changes can be very large-scale and potentially damaging, with potential for pollution of major rivers and aquifers. While a number of modelling approaches have been developed in recent decades to predict these changes and facilitate their proactive (and prophylactic) management, when the last mine in a given coalfield is closing the mine owners typically have neither the time nor money to commission extended and sophisticated numerical modelling studies. In such circumstances, a simplified, lower-cost approach is required to provide regulators with predictions of rates of water level rise, future equilibrium water levels and the rates and quality of any future outflows of mine water to rivers and/or aquifers. These predictions can also be useful in guiding the decisions of future site owners over alternative uses of colliery infrastructure after the cessation of coal production. An approach to such predictions has been developed which is based on summary information on the extent of workings, <b>dewatering</b> <b>pumping</b> rates, locations and collar elevations of unfilled shafts and adits attached to the deep workings, as well as surface topography and the geometry of any overlying aquifers. Uncertainties over hydraulic gradient after the completion of water level recovery are handled by analogy to a range of post-recovery gradients from similar large coalfields. A brief example of the application of the approach to a real coalfield is presented. This approach could be used either on its own or as a prelude to more detailed modelling and monitoring during the years following mine closure. The insights into system behaviour gained from such exercises could well be valuable in future re-use of flooded voids as resources for heat recovery or disposal as part of low-carbon heating systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{forty years}} of {{intensive}} mine dewatering in the Transdanubian Range contributed to getting high quality and large amount of data about the karstified aquifers, {{which could not be}} gained in any other way. In addition to providing the claimed depression to the safety mining under the original karst water level, the scientific investigation of the processes was emphasized. Although the mines were abandoned the data sets could be a great base of additional investigation about the karstified aquifers. This paper presents the evaluation of <b>dewatering</b> data as <b>pumping</b> test data by using many methods...|$|R
40|$|New {{infrastructures}} {{can be seen}} as {{a vehicle}} to interpret the cultural stratifications of a territory, like shares of structures composing and increasing the value of the crossed landscapes, connecting their most meaningful places. The knowledge of the specificities and the criticalities of the Venetian territory, can guides in the definition of new cultural itineraries, integrated with the network of routes and connected to actions of retraining for the places of archaeology with landscape interest. The attention turns to the territory of Rovigo’s District, delimited and innervated by navigable waterways that strongly have characterized the construction as the agricultural and industrial use of the ground. Between the Po and Adige Rivers there are unusual intersections on different scales, just where the future motorways (Nogara-Adriatic Sea, south Valdastico, New Romea) going through a predominantly agricultural landscape, they intercept both an important water network and a considerable heritage of industrial archaeology. In Polesine, if the referable recoveries to the classical archaeology, as those imputable to preceding historical periods, rarely represent "visible” consistencies, the excavations, with the exception of few cases, have brought to the light fragments of settlements, some of which removed from the places of founding again to be recomposed and shown inside the local museums. In the countryside, many places and artefacts remember the industrial past of the region: ex sugar or tobacco factories, hemp-mill, but also former furnaces and <b>dewatering</b> <b>pumps,</b> otherwise tied up to the geomorphology of the places. The dereliction and the absence of a project considering the heritage in its whole, often move politics of recovery turning those buildings into museums of themselves. For these questions, the research is detecting a series of possible correlated actions, by which few visible archaeological sites can be integrated in some significant cultural routes. The nature represents, in such sense, together with the rural vocation of the region, an important tool of project, verifying in progress different sceneries within some study cases. One of them is constituted by the layout of an abandoned railway line, departing from Adria, and reaching Ariano Polesine. On the other side, the essay underline the ways of giving quality to a territory by means of the right relationships between new infrastructures and the different archaeologies of Veneto’s landscape...|$|R
40|$|Firefly II {{pump module}} is NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center's {{commercial}} offshoot of a NASA/US Coast Guard program involving {{development of a}} lightweight, helicopter-transportable firefighting module for a quick response in combating shipboard or harbor fires. Operable on land or water, the Amphib One is equipped with 3 water cannons. When all 3 are operating, unit pumps more than 3, 000 gallons a minute. Newly developed model used by U. S. Coast Guard can pump 5, 000 gallons per minute. It was designed for applications such as firefighting onboard ship fires, emergency dockside water <b>pumping,</b> <b>dewatering</b> ships in danger of sinking, flood control, and emergency water supply at remote locations...|$|R
40|$|Storage of sugar-beet mud in the {{traditional}} way, i. e., direct <b>dewatering</b> after <b>pumping</b> the slurry in storage basins, may cause odor nuisance because of digestion of organic substances. In order to prevent these bad odor problems the mud should remain submerged during the digestion period. No production of malodorous compounds was observed in this way, also not when after 1 yr of submersion the basins were dewatered and the mud began to ripen. Experiments were performed with small mud fields, barrels and pots {{in order to gain}} insight in the anaerobic digestion processes and to develop methods to optimize these. During these experiments the mud was subjected to a number of different treatments. No essential difference exists between the digestion process in dewatered and submerged mud. The digestion rate of the produced volatile fatty acids (VFA) depends on the growth rate of the bacteria responsible for the conversion of VFA into CH 4 and CO 2. This growth rate seems to be controlled in the pot experiment by the amount of available NH 4 -N. Treatment of the mud, for instance inoculation with old ripened mud or addition of carbonates, is only successful when the environmental conditions in the mud are very unfavorable for methane production (high VFA concentrations and low pH) ...|$|R
25|$|Watertight {{subdivision}} limits loss of buoyancy and freeboard in {{the event}} of damage, and may protect vital machinery from flooding. Most ships have some pumping capacity to remove accumulated water from the bilges, but a steel ship with no watertight subdivision will sink if water accumulates faster than pumps can remove it. Standards of watertight subdivision assume no <b>dewatering</b> capability, although <b>pumps</b> kept in working order may provide an additional measure of safety {{in the event}} of minor leaks. The most common watertight subdivision is accomplished with transverse bulkheads dividing the elongated hull into a number of watertight floodable lengths. Early watertight subdivision tested with hoses sometimes failed to withstand the hydrostatic pressure of an adjoining flooded compartment. Effective watertight subdivision requires these transverse bulkheads to be both watertight and structurally sound.|$|R
40|$|The Bull Arm Fabrication Site is a {{world class}} {{facility}} built in Mosquito Cove, Newfoundland and Labrador in the 1990 ’s as a construction site for the first Gravity Based Structure based oil production platform on Canada’s Grand Banks known as Hibernia. This huge multimillion dollar facility boasts: on site pipe and rebar fabrication, concrete batch plants, large module construction halls, and many other permanent facilities. Noticeably, one of the critical facilities seemingly missing is a functional and reusable dry dock. Each large project requiring such a facility must, at the project owner’s expense, create their own functional dry dock facility within Mosquito Cove. To date, the favoured solutions for the two largest mega projects constructed at Bull Arm has been a geotechnical solution with placed aggregate forming a bund wall or dyke around the cove and <b>dewatering</b> by <b>pumping</b> water out via crane emplaced temporary pumps. Is this current functional solution the best available? As of 2008 Nalcor Energy, the provincial utility and energy crown corporation, has been granted control of the facility and has touted a focus of continuous and concentrated work at the facility {{with little or no}} downtime The following paper will discuss the advantages of a temporary geotechnical solution with project descriptions of recent uses of this method. A focus on practicality, environmental issues, and possible upcoming projects will be discussed...|$|R
