500|$|Jolie was {{involved}} in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of having caused the 2005 divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. She {{had fallen in love with}} Pitt during filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), but dismissed allegations of an affair, saying, [...] "To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife." [...] Jolie and Pitt did not publicly comment on the nature of their relationship until January 2006, when she confirmed that she was pregnant with his child.|$|E
500|$|Zero has {{received}} a mixed reaction from western video game critics. GamesRadar's Becky Cunningham praised Tara Platt's performance in the role, and that her relationship with Mikhail helped humanize her. GameSpot's Heidi Kemps found Zero entertaining despite her negative portrayal, enjoying the points where she breaks the fourth wall to critique the game's puzzles and finding that she [...] "related to [...] as the game progressed, which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> typically feel for antihero characters." [...] Eurogamer's Chris Schilling found that Zero's presence turned the game into [...] "a jet-black comedy", comparing her favorably to Jordan Belfort: while both unlikable characters, there was [...] "something magnetic about their horribleness". Destructoid's Chris Carter commended Drakengard 3 and Zero, saying [...] " [...] was drawn into [...] world and its cast of characters, and I wanted to see Zero's journey through from start to finish." [...] This view was shared by Will Borger of Gaming Bolt, who called story, characters, world, and in particular Zero, the reasons for playing the game. In addition, he felt that players would find themselves relating to her more as the story progressed.|$|E

Geoff Boycott was also in attendance, along with Fred Trueman's widow Veronica and Colin Graves who, as Yorkshire County Cricket Club chairman, accepted the honour on behalf of Wilfred Rhodes. Botham said: [...] "To be named amongst 55 of the most prolific players in cricketing history is a great honour for me. To have my cricketing career recognised in the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> would have thought when I began playing cricket but to be receiving this award today is something I'm extremely grateful for". Colin Graves included Botham in his tribute to Rhodes when he said: [...] "It is a great honour to accept the cap on behalf of a Yorkshire legend. Wilfred Rhodes was an exceedingly gifted player and is rightly regarded as one of England's greatest all-rounders. I am also delighted to see two other great Yorkshiremen and another great all-rounder inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame today".|$|E

5000|$|Close Your Eyes is {{the fifth}} studio album by New Zealand singer-song writer Bic Runga. The album {{is made up of}} ten covers and two {{original}} tracks. Upon announcement of the album in October, Runga said: [...] "There are so many songs I've always wanted to cover. I wanted to see if I could <b>not</b> just <b>be</b> a singer-songwriter, but someone who could also interpret songs. In the process, I found there are so many reasons why a cover version wouldn't work, perhaps because the lyrics <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> could relate to first hand, because technically I wasn't ready or because the original was too iconic. But the songs that all made it on the record specifically say something about where I'm at in my life, better than if I'd written it myself. It was a challenging process, I'm really proud of the singing and the production and the statement".|$|R

I'm not a social person, so having to talk to DJs to make them play a record <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> want to do.

5000|$|Meg Hutchinson {{was raised}} by English {{teachers}} {{in a small town}} outside of Great Barrington, Massachusetts called South Egremont. Growing up in the Berkshires, the mountains, woods and ponds were her childhood muses, as were poets she read (like Mary Oliver, Robert Frost and William Butler Yeats), and the songwriters she listened to (like Greg Brown and Joni Mitchell). When she inherited her grandmother's 1957 Martin guitar at age eleven, her love of words found an inspiring instrument.

Of course, there is, in that respect, nothing special about this particular linguistic performance: In general, speaking is something we do, and we are held responsible or given credit for our saying what we do, much as we are held responsible or given credit for other things that we do. And rightly so, since speaking is something we do.

Not many philosophers have given the fact much notice in recent years, however, though there are two very notable exceptions: Michael Dummett and John McDowell.

40|$|Methods for {{detecting}} cheating on multiple-choice tests are discussed, with particular {{focus on the}} Harpp-Hogan index. An investigation of {{the reliability of the}} H-H index was undertaken in two professional testing environments, with results suggesting the index can only be used with great caution. A comparison is made of the features available in selected software packages, and recommendations made for practitioners. As the author of the Lertap item and test analysis package (Nelson, 20001), I attempt to respond to modification requests from users as time allows. Early in 2005, the director of a large-scale testing program wrote to ask if Lertap might someday build in support for cheat checking, that is, {{for detecting}} the extent to which students in a given test venue may have engaged in answer copying or sharing.

Detecting cheating on multiple-choice exams <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> familiar with.
