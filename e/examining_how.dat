5|$|At its {{session of}} 23 November 2006, the {{planning}} {{committee of the}} city council charged its staff with <b>examining</b> <b>how</b> the Altes Stadthaus could be used for large-scale retail without damaging it as an architectural landmark. The report, which was presented at the end of December, recommended reuse of the already modified internal space housing the library, and creation of additional usable space up to a total of approximately 1600m². This could be done by lowering the floor to street level and modifying stairway areas without changing the external appearance of the building, which is characteristic of government buildings of the 1920s, particularly in its blocky ground floor. Changes to the upper floors, which remained largely in their original condition, were not recommended.|$|E

40|$|Pricing of {{loanable funds}} without a proper {{rationale}} or framework leads to uncertainty and unpredictability on {{the incidence of}} the next or expected interest rate. The uncertainty and unpredictability lead to high interest rates to cover for any eventual loss. High interest rates may lead to high cost of capital, low investment, reduction in aggregate supply {{of goods and services}} and a vicious circle that reduces economic growth. It also reduces credit availability and increase the risk of speculation and adverse selection. These problems result in lower standard of living due to reduced disposable income. The specific objectives of the study were: to <b>examine</b> <b>how</b> changes in wealth influence pricing of loanable funds by commercial banks in Kenya. Secondly, to <b>examine</b> <b>how</b> expected return on bonds relative to alternative assets influence pricing of loanable funds by commercial banks in Kenya.

25|$|The first {{experiments}} with predation and spatial heterogeneity {{were conducted by}} G.F. Gause in the 1930s, based on the Lotka-Volterra equation, which was formulated in the mid-1920s, but no further application had been conducted. The Lotka-Volterra equation suggested {{that the relationship between}} predators and their prey would result in population oscillations over time based on the initial densities of predator and prey. Gause's early experiments to prove the predicted oscillations of this theory failed because the predator–prey interactions were not influenced by immigration. However, once immigration was introduced, the population cycles accurately depicted the oscillations predicted by the Lotka-Volterra equation, with the peaks in prey abundance shifted slightly {{to the left of the}} peaks of the predator densities. Huffaker's experiments expanded on those of Gause by <b>examining</b> <b>how</b> both the factors of migration and spatial heterogeneity lead to predator–prey oscillations.|$|E
25|$|Specific binding {{refers to}} the binding of a ligand to a receptor, and it is {{possible}} that {{there is more than one}} specific binding site for one ligand. Non specific binding {{refers to the}} binding of a ligand to something other than its designated receptor such as various other receptors, or different types of transporters in the cell membrane. For example, various antagonists can bind to multiple types receptors. In the case of muscarinic antagonists, they can also bind to histamine receptors. Such binding patterns are technically considered specific, as the destination of the ligand is specific to multiple receptors. However, researchers may not be focused on such behaviors compared to other binding factors. Nevertheless, nonspecific binding behavior is very important information to acquire. These estimates are measured by <b>examining</b> <b>how</b> a ligand binds to a receptor while simultaneously reacting to a substitute agent (antagonist) that will prevent specific binding to occur.|$|E
25|$|Referencing the {{inherent}} qualities {{of a system}} {{in place of a}} reference state environment is the most direct way that ecologists determine the exergy of a natural resource. Specifically, it is easiest to examine the thermodynamic properties of a system, and the reference substances that are acceptable within the reference environment. This determination allows for the assumption of qualities in a natural state: deviation from these levels may indicate a change in the environment caused by outside sources. There are three kinds of reference substances that are acceptable, due to their proliferation on the planet: gases within the atmosphere, solids within the Earth’s crust, and molecules or ions in seawater. By understanding these basic models, it’s possible to determine the exergy of multiple earth systems interacting, like the effects of solar radiation on plant life. These basic categories are utilized as the main components of a reference environment when <b>examining</b> <b>how</b> exergy can be defined through natural resources.|$|E

25|$|In {{a report}} {{published}} in 1926 in Transactions of the Faraday Society, James Franck {{was concerned with}} the mechanisms of photon-induced chemical reactions. The presumed mechanism was the excitation of a molecule by a photon, followed by a collision with another molecule during the short period of excitation. The question was whether {{it was possible for}} a molecule to break into photoproducts in a single step, the absorption of a photon, and without a collision. In order for a molecule to break apart, it must acquire from the photon a vibrational energy exceeding the dissociation energy, that is, the energy to break a chemical bond. However, as was known at the time, molecules will only absorb energy corresponding to allowed quantum transitions, and there are no vibrational levels above the dissociation energy level of the potential well. High-energy photon absorption leads to a transition to a higher electronic state instead of dissociation. In <b>examining</b> <b>how</b> much vibrational energy a molecule could acquire when it is excited to a higher electronic level, and whether this vibrational energy could be enough to immediately break apart the molecule, he drew three diagrams representing the possible changes in binding energy between the lowest electronic state and higher electronic states.|$|E
