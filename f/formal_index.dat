Discussion focuses on the implications of this scheme for scale development, taxonomy construction, and theory building in personality psychology.

40|$|Debate {{continues}} in the academic literature about the measurement and interpretation of residential segregation. Poulsen, Johnston, and Forrest have been prolific writers in this area with papers exploring the pattern of ethnic segregation in cities, including Sydney, Auckland, and New York. They mainly use two related techniques, namely a fixed typology of areas (within a region) based on their white versus nonwhite population composition and an index of concentration (see, for example, Johnston et al, 2002; Poulsen et al, 2002, 2004). Poulsen and Johnston (2006) {{are concerned about the}} misinterpretation of their results concerning the changing levels of ethnic residential segregation in Bradford and Greater London. They use their typology of areas based on ethnic composition in order to convey the "right message". They also reject the use of <b>formal</b> <b>index</b> measurement.

40|$|AbstractThe {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{investigate}} the <b>formal</b> deficiency <b>indices</b> N± of a symmetric first-order systemJf′+Bf=λHfon an interval I, where I=R or I=R±. Here J,B,H are n×n matrix-valued functions and the Hamiltonian H⩾ 0 may be singular even everywhere. We obtain two results for such a system to have minimal numbers (N±= 0 if I=R resp. N±=n if I=R+) and a criterion for their maximality N±= 2 n for I=R+ (as well as the quasi-regularity). This covers the Kac–Krein and de Branges (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 99 (1961) 118) theorems on 2 × 2 canonical systems and some results from Kogan and Rofe–Beketov (Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh Sect. A 74 (1974 / 75) 5). Some conditions for a canonical system to have intermediate <b>formal</b> deficiency <b>indices</b> are presented, too. We also obtain a generalization of the well known Titchmarsh–Sears theorem for second-order Sturm–Liouville-type equations. This contains results due to Lidskii and Krein as special cases. We present two approaches to the above problems: one dealing with <b>formal</b> deficiency <b>indices</b> and one dealing with (ordinary) deficiency indices. Our main (non-formal) approach is based on the investigation of a symmetric linear relation Smin which is naturally associated to a first-order system. This approach works in the framework of extension theory and therefore we investigate in detail the domain D(Smin∗) of Smin∗. In particular, we prove the so called regularity theorem for D(Smin∗).

Longitudinal data on individual careers in education were used, primarily for educators in Oregon during the period 1971 - 81, but in some instances for educators in New York during the 1970 s. Little evidence is found of sex discrimination in salaries of teachers in the 1970 s, and only very small sex-related differences in wage responsiveness and interdistrict mobility were noted. Evidence on Promotions to administrative positions indicates {{that in the early}} 1970 s female teachers were significantly less likely to be promoted than similarly qualified male teachers, but that by the late 1970 s the difference was no longer significant. In addition, <b>formal</b> <b>index</b> measures of discrimination declined by about half during the same period.

This emergence of NTMs, especially standards like NTMs, has been also motivated by concerns about market imperfections to address asymmetric information and external effects. Sorting protectionism from legitimate market intervention has been difficult and attempts have lack formalism. In addition, the empirical evidence {{on the impact of}} these NTMs on trade flows has been cluttered with few obvious implications for policy design. The first essay takes a meta-analysis approach to rationalize the systematic variations in the estimated NTM effects on trade in the current literature.

40|$|Modeling of {{evaporative}} separators {{with mass}} and energy balances, only, {{often leads to}} di erential algebraic systems (DAE) with di erential index 2. To overcome the problems which {{are associated with the}} numerical solution of index 2 DAEs either a <b>formal</b> <b>index</b> reduction can be applied or the model can be reformulated by modifying the underlying assumptions. Typical modi cations leading to index 1 problems are either the assumption of a quasistatic energy balance or the inclusion of some simple uid dynamics. In the present paper the dynamic behavior predicted by these di erent model formulations are analyzed and compared with each other. First, focus is on an isolated single stage ash process with given heat input. The well-known adiabatic ash is included as a special case. It is shown that the dynamic behavior of the di erent model formulations for a stand alone ash are rather close. In particular, in all cases a stable steady state is predicted. Second, a simple reactor-separator system with recycle is considered. The reactor is a CSTR, whereas the separator is again a constantly heated ash. In a previous paper we have shown, that the recycle in such a system can induce instability and multiplicity of steady states [1]. In the present paper it is shown, that although the stand alone ash is rather insensitive to the speci c model formulation, the dynamics of the coupled system can under certain conditions to be speci ed in this paper depend on the speci c model formulation applied. In particular, a new type of bifurcation is found where the eigenvalues have a pole with a change of sign. The analysis is based on a model with negligible transportation delay of the recycle. Furthermore, these investigations are extended to reactor-distillation column models. In such models complex bifurcation structures consisting of periodic, complex-periodic, and even deterministic chaotic oscillations have been characterized. These bifurcation structures show interesting analogies to scenarios found in isothermal autocatalytic oscillators, like the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction [2] or the peroxidase-oxidase reaction [3]. It is illustrated that the observed bifurcation scenario critically depends on the formulation of the energy balance equation of the distillation column. © 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|This design {{research}} {{explores the}} architectural {{limits of the}} imaged based figure both as a formal ‘cast’ and for its spatial potential. Employing a class of figure that had shape but no explicit figurative specificity, the research aimed {{to see if it}} yielded a formal outcome that was in keeping with the conditions of figural inundation and repetition occurring in the experiential space of the suburban zone of the contemporary city. As an organizational and formal strategy this figure type might not only usefully challenge the orthodoxy of the plan as the primary design &# 039;instrument&# 039; in urban design practice but also productively guide the development of the campus master plan. Moreover this type of figure and the accompanying design process used to generate three-dimensional form could together initiate a unique formal outcome and have representational import. The primary vehicle of this research was the proposed RMIT Janefield Technology Estate. Located on the northern suburban periphery of Melbourne, the institutional character and context of this project provided an ideal vehicle to encompassed issues of representation and signification, and allowed one to see how the formal consequences of the figure ‘played out’ within the broader social and political context of this suburban periphery. It was intended that this type of figure would be deployed to exceed and confound any ‘conceptual’ totalizing frameworks so it was important that it functioned in a way that contested semiotic specificity and was instead non-referential: like a logo it marks an entity rather than imparting identity. This required both a testing the figure against the pragmatics of program and site and assessing its ability to furnish the institution with a recognizable ‘logo’ that could represent and distinguish the unique learning and research activities planned for the Janefield Campus. Strategically the deployment of such a figure yielded a shape that established a <b>formal</b> <b>index</b> that created a tactical misalignment between expectation (gained form the plan) and experience (as one moves through the campus). In doing so architecture was asked to operate in a ‘formless’ and open way. It was therefore an expectation that the Janefield figure could be open and generous enough for meaning to arise from an individual&# 039;s experience of the campus, as opposed to it having a figurative meaning sanctioned, assigned and propagated from ‘above’. Consequently the project aimed to see first if the figure acts equally as an experientially pervasive ‘alternative’ institutional logo that avoids the representational closure of semiotic signification and also opens the possibility of the use of the figure as a mechanism of affect...|$|E

Objectives The {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate the effectiveness of extract of OB on rat behavior in the EPM test. Materials and Methods Male Wistar rats weighing 220 - 250 g were used in the present study. Forty rats were divided into 4 groups: three OB groups (25, 50, 100 mg/kg oral administration of OB for 7 days) and a saline control group. One day after the last day of feeding, the animals’ behavior in EPM was videotaped for 10 minutes. Then, their behavior scored for <b>formal</b> <b>indexes</b> of anxiety, such as the total distance covered by animals, the percentage of entries into and the time spent in open and closed arms. Results The results showed that after oral feeding of OB, the percentage of open arms entry and open arms time in EPM increased in the experimental groups. OB extract has no effect on the total distance covered by animals and number of closed arm entries. Conclusions Our results demonstrated that the extract of OB could induce anxiolytic effect in rats after 1 week oral administration. The effect of OB was not induced through changes in motor activity.

40|$|This thesis investigates how two {{distinctive}} and conflicting literary modernisms generate, and subsequently attempt {{to deal with}} the proliferation of difficult historical meaning. Part one scrutinizes three novels from William Faulkner’s middle period, The Sound and the Fury (1929), As I Lay Dying (1930), and Sanctuary (1931). Its arguments issue from three linked assumptions: first, that semantic meaning, in Faulkner, resides within the smallest of textual locations; second, that this meaning is insistently historical; and third, that the attempt to hide its release as historical meaning generates a formal opacity that, in turn, occasions acutely visual problems {{at the level of the}} text. Specific attention is drawn to what I consider to be the “compacted doctrines” (Empson) of Faulkner’s prose: the pronoun. It is argued that, in these three novels, historically sedimented meaning congeals in three single words: “them”, “I” and finally, “it”. If Faulkner’s texts come into meaning at the level of the word, John Dos Passos’ come into meaning at the level of the concept. What was “small”, begrudging, and intractable in Faulkner becomes “big”, abundant, and eminently retrievable in Dos Passos. The semantic “concept” to which I attend is The Camera Eye, a place of visual efficiency. Two parallel concerns drive these chapters. First, I claim that The Camera Eye is the preeminent site of the dialectic in U. S. A.; second, that these episodes provide the <b>formal</b> <b>indices</b> for Dos Passos’ shift in political intensities. Sustaining an antagonistic tension between aesthetic modernity and historical memory, however, these mechanical integers problematize their own semantic productions.

40|$|Narrative, as {{one means}} of {{processing}} life experience through language, {{is a significant}} human act. Its fuller understanding holds practical meaning for education too, in that teachers can structure language situations around narrative, it being acquired by children before their entry to primary school. Various perspectives on narrative have been taken, their focus of attention often being broad functional aspects of narrative, approached through the understandings of psychology, anthropology, rhetoric, literary criticism and philosophy. These perspectives have produced analytical schemes for insight into narrative as genre, with greater or lesser degrees of emphasis being placed on the internal organisation of narrative and on linguistic aspects of its structure. It is from a linguistic perspective that narrative has been studied in this work, {{the primary purpose of}} the study being to apply and evaluate a particular paradigm structure for narrative analysis. 'The framework for narrative analysis generated by Labov and Waletzky in 1967 was applied to written narratives collected from Australian-English users and evaluated for its usefulness. Chapters 4 and 5 of this work report both formal and functional analyses of these written narratives toward establishing the semantic structure of the collected stories. The patterns of meaning for the written narratives were found largely to match the categories provided by Labov and Waletzky, their framework being a useful one for the study of autobiographical written narrative. Evaluation emerged as the most significant element in the construction of effective narrative, a narrator's capacity to take a multiple perspective on the reported events being central to his evaluative ability. A secondary concern of this study was with exploring comparisons between intuitive understandings of narrative and their adequacy for its description and interpretation with the more formal tools of linguistic analysis. It was found that intuitive and <b>formal</b> <b>indices</b> of quality narrative overlap in the information they give about narrative, the only difference between them being that formal insights are more explicit.

40|$|Abstract — The article {{proposes a}} simple, {{scalable}} and robust scheme for {{the distribution of}} revocation information in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). The scheme is intended for ad hoc networks with a planned origin, and where a common point of trust exists. Mobile ad hoc networks have limited available bandwidth. The revocation lists must therefore be specific to the network. They are established {{with the aid of}} trusted gateways reporting the identity of the nodes to a central trusted entity. To minimize overhead, the revocation lists are distributed along with the routing messages. In the articles we discuss how the scheme can be implemented in conjunction with the predominant routing protocols in ad hoc networks. The article also provides a detailed security analysis of the proposed protocols, partly based on the use of <b>formal</b> methods. <b>Index</b> Terms—Management, ad hoc networks, revocation, routing protocols and formal method.

40|$|Software reuse is {{a process}} of {{constructing}} a software system using existing software components. Formal approaches to software reuse rely heavily upon specification matching criterion, where a search query using formal specifications is used to search a library to identify components {{that can be used for}} reuse purposes. In previous investigations, we addressed the use of formal methods and component libraries to support software reuse and construction of software based on architectural specifications. One of the primary difficulties of using a formal approach for software reuse that makes use of formally specified components is that it is not clear how the <b>formal</b> specification <b>indices</b> are created. Software reverse engineering {{is a process}} of examining system components and component interrelationships in order to derive a description of the system at a higher level of abstraction. We have developed an approach to reverse engineering that is based on the use of formal methods to derive [...] ...|$|R
40|$|There are two either {{explicitly}} or implicitly {{and widely}} accepted {{ideas about the}} distribution of land in Ethiopia after the reform of 1975. First, land distribution in rural Ethiopia is highly equitable, for example compared to other African countries where private ownership exists. Second, the land distribution pattern currently observed is basically explained by what happened after the reform; hence, pre-reform tenures do not help us understand post-reform land distribution. This paper questions both these ideas. Using <b>formal</b> inequality <b>indexes</b> and a methodology that explicitly considers measurement errors, the empirical results indicate that both inter- and intra-regional inequalities are high; inequality {{in the distribution of}} land is as high as or even higher than other African countries. The paper also argues that the post-reform distribution is likely influenced by pre-reform distribution and calls for a more detailed historical analysis that attempts to understand the link between old tenure structures and land distribution after the land reform. 1...|$|R
