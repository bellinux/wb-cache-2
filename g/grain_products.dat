5|$|Mainstream American cuisine {{is similar}} to that in other Western countries. Wheat is the primary cereal grain with about three-quarters of <b>grain</b> <b>products</b> made of wheat flour and many dishes use {{indigenous}} ingredients, such as turkey, venison, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup which were consumed by Native Americans and early European settlers. These home grown foods are part of a shared national menu on one of America's most popular holidays; Thanksgiving, when some Americans make traditional foods to celebrate the occasion.|$|E

25|$|Canada's Food Guide {{is another}} example government-run {{nutrition}} program. Produced by Health Canada, the guide advises food quantities, provides education on balanced nutrition, and promotes physical activity in accordance with government-mandated nutrient needs. Like other nutrition programs around the world, Canada's Food Guide divides nutrition into four main food groups: vegetables and fruit, <b>grain</b> <b>products,</b> milk and alternatives, and meat and alternatives. It {{is interesting to note}} that, unlike its American counterpart, the Canadian guide references and provides alternative to meat and dairy, which {{can be attributed to the}} growing vegan and vegetarian movements.|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{livestock}} product {{consumption in}} many Asian countries {{has been accompanied}} by growth in some countries’ imports of feedgrains for their domestic livestock sectors. This contributes to debate over future levels of grain imports. Yet projections often pay little attention to developments in livestock production. The impacts of technological catch‐up in livestock production on trade in livestock and <b>grains</b> <b>products</b> among countries in the Asia‐Pacific region are assessed. Tests are conducted of the hypothesis that productivity levels in the Asia‐Pacific region are converging. Projections of livestock productivity are made and incorporated in a modified GTAP model.

25|$|When the U.S. Food and Drug Administration set the {{folic acid}} {{fortification}} regulation in 1996, the projected increase in folic acid intake was 100nbsp&µg/d.

Folic acid intake above the {{upper tolerable intake level}} (1000µg folic acid/d) increased only among those individuals consuming folic acid supplements as well as folic acid found in fortified <b>grain</b> <b>products.</b> Taken together, folic acid fortification has led to a bigger increase in folic acid intake than first projected.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to note that the federal regulations under 21 CFR Part 139 are standards for the products noted, not mandates. Following the FDA’s standards, a number of states have, at various times, enacted their own statutes that serve as mandates for various forms of macaroni and noodle products that may be produced or sold within their borders. Many of these specifically require that the products sold within those states be of the enriched form. According to a report released by the Connecticut Office of Legislative Research, when Connecticut’s law was adopted in 1972 that mandated certain <b>grain</b> <b>products,</b> including macaroni products, sold within the state to be enriched it joined 38 to 40 other states in adopting the federal standards as mandates.|$|E
25|$|Another notable {{consequence}} of the Black Death was the raising of the real wage of England (due to the shortage of labour {{as a result of}} the reduction in population), a trait shared across Western Europe, which in general led to a real wage in 1450 that was unmatched in most countries until the 19th or 20th century. The higher wages for workers combined with sinking prices on <b>grain</b> <b>products</b> led to a problematic economic situation for the gentry. As a result, they started to show an increased interest for offices like justice of the peace, sheriff and member of parliament. The gentry took advantage of their new positions and a more systematic corruption than before spread. A result of this was that the gentry as a group became highly disliked by commoners.|$|E

25|$|The potato was {{introduced}} to Ireland as a garden crop of the gentry. By the late 17th century, it had become widespread as a supplementary rather than a principal food because the main diet still revolved around butter, milk, and <b>grain</b> <b>products.</b> However, {{in the first two}} decades of the 18th century, it became a base food of the poor, especially in winter. Furthermore, a disproportionate share of the potatoes grown in Ireland were of a single variety, the Irish Lumper. The expansion of the economy between 1760 and 1815 saw the potato make inroads into the diet of the people and become a staple food year round for farmers. The large dependency on this single crop, and the lack of genetic variability among the potato plants in Ireland, were two of the reasons why the emergence of Phytophthora infestans had such devastating effects in Ireland and less severe effects elsewhere in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Although {{only about}} one-quarter of Taiwan's land area is {{suitable}} for farming, virtually all farmland is intensely cultivated, with some areas suitable for two and even three crops a year. However, increases in agricultural production have been much slower than industrial growth. Agricultural modernization has been inhibited by {{the small size of}} farms and the lack of investment in better facilities and training to develop more profitable businesses. Taiwan's agricultural population has steadily decreased from 1974 to 2002, prompting the Council of Agriculture to introduce modern farm management, provide technical training, and offer counseling for better production and distribution systems. Promotion of farm mechanization has helped to alleviate labor shortages while increasing productivity; both rice and sugar cane production are completely mechanized. Taiwan's main crops are rice, sugar cane, fruits (many of them tropical), and vegetables. Although self-sufficient in rice production, Taiwan imports large amounts of wheat, mostly from the United States. Meat production and consumption has risen sharply, reflecting a high standard of living. Taiwan has exported large amounts of frozen pork, although this was affected by an outbreak of hoof and mouth disease in 1997. Other agricultural exports include fish, aquaculture and sea products, canned and frozen vegetables, and <b>grain</b> <b>products.</b> Imports of agriculture products are expected to increase due to the WTO accession, which is opening previously protected agricultural markets.|$|E
