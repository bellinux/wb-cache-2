To solve the dynamic programming problem, we propose a general class of optimization problems with forward separable objectives. We then show that for any problem in this class, there exists an augmented-state dynamic programming problem which satisfies the principle of optimality and the solutions to which yield solutions to the original forward separable problem.

Some electric utilities provide rate schedules for commercial customers without imposing demand charges.

40|$|Demand {{control is}} the concept of {{regulating}} the peak electrical demand of a commercial, industrial or residential power system so as to minimize the peak <b>demand</b> <b>charges</b> that must be paid by the customer to the electric utility providing the power.

The attention given to demand control has been rapidly increasing due to increasing electricity rates and the application of microprocessor technology to this concept. In regulating his peak demand,- the customer desires to accomplish the same amount of work as before. Some demand control has been achieved through the optimum scheduling of electrical use while additional savings can be achieved through conservation practices (conservation practice also reduce the total energy consumed).

40|$|Bulk {{consumers}} {{are the main}} revenue generating category of the electricity consumer mix in Sri Lanka. Their contribution has a large impact on demand in the power distribution network. The tariff applied, the metering system and the analysis of their consumption {{is very important to}} the utility and to the consumer. Optimizing the resources in the power distribution network is very important to the utility. The utility has to encourage the consumer to manage the load scientifically. The energy consumed should be charged in a fair manner. Paying a reasonable bill is appreciated by any consumer. In this context, application of a 'cost reflective' tariff is fair by the consumer and the utility. As a country on the whole, it is an important attempt to utilize the energy in the most cost effective manner. This would help the country facing the energy crisis, sustain the industries and employment, and enhance the power quality and reliability. The objective of this research is to investigate individual and collective demand profiles of bulk consumers, and to encourage them to implement demand management measures. This is done by introducing a better cost reflective tariff. Thereby, both the consumer and the utility would be benefited. Electronic digital meters, with remote meter reading facility, were introduced very recently. These meters provide detailed information about the consumer's demand profile and give an in-depth view of their electricity consumption. Studying these demand profiles show that there are many consumers with a poor power factor, consuming a large amount of reactive power from the system, transmitted {{all the way from the}} point of generation. This causes excessive burdens on the network for handling extra current and causing excessive power and energy losses. In this research, an effective sample of bulk consumers who consume a large amount of reactive power is considered. In order to encourage them to improve their power factor, it is suggested to introduce a charge for reactive power consumption (in Rs/kvarh). Considering a sample, the price of a unit of reactive energy is calculated based on, if the utility does the power factor correction and if the consumer does the correction. It will be shown that, it is more appropriate for the consumer to do the power factor correction on their own. This suggested charge is much reasonable to both the utility and the consumer. A charge for the consumption of reactive power would be cost reflective and would reward high power factor consumers by giving a lower maximum <b>demand</b> <b>charge.</b> Thereby, the consumers with a poor power factor are encouraged to improve their power factor. With this enhancement to the tariff, both the utility and the consumer will be benefited. The maximum <b>demand</b> <b>charge</b> is imposed to reduce the demand of system in general. However, it does not deal the issues of low power factor, in a cost reflective manner. It is also imposed, to compel the consumer to manage his demand-peaks as much as possible. Both these components contribute to the maximum <b>demand</b> <b>charge.</b> By removing the power factor contribution from the presently applied 'Maximum Demand' charge, the demand-peak component can be isolated. Thus, the new maximum <b>demand</b> <b>charge</b> would inevitably become a lesser charge. The demand-peak component is a burden to the utility during the system peak period. During the off peak period, these individual demand-peaks will not cause much difficulty to the utility to cope up with. Therefore, it should be applied on a time of day basis. It is reasonable to apply a lesser charge (as an incentive) during off-peak, and a higher charge during peak load time period. Thereby, the bulk {{consumers are}} encouraged to shift on to off peak time. This enhanced tariff structure would benefit both the consumer and the utility. The study concludes by suggesting a charge for the monthly reactive energy consumption, while recommending a reduction in the present maximum <b>demand</b> <b>charge.</b> Further, the bulk consumers are categorized into five types, based on their demand profile. These may be used in extending the study to design a maximum <b>demand</b> <b>charge</b> base on time of day...|$|E
40|$|To {{achieve a}} sizable and {{self-sustaining}} market for grid-connected, customer-sited photovoltaic (PV) systems, solar will likely {{need to be}} competitive with retail electricity rates. In this report, we {{examine the impact of}} retail rate design on the economic value of commercial PV systems in California. Using 15 -minute interval building load and PV production data from 24 actual commercial PV installations, we compare the value of the bill savings across 20 commercial customer retail rates currently offered in the state. We find that the specifics of the rate structure, combined with the characteristics of the customer's underlying load {{and the size of the}} PV system, can have a substantial impact on the customer-economics of commercial PV systems. Key conclusions for policymakers that emerge from our analysis are as follows: {sm_bullet} Rate design is fundamental to the economics of commercial PV. The rate-reduction value of PV for our sample of commercial customers, considering all available retail tariffs, ranges from $ 0. 05 /kWh to $ 0. 24 /kWh, reflecting differences in rate structures, the revenue requirements of the various utilities, the size of the PV system relative to building load, and customer load shapes. For the average customer in our sample, differences in rate structure, alone, alter the value of PV by 25 % to 75 %, depending on the size of the PV system relative to building load. {sm_bullet} TOU-based energy-focused rates can provide substantial value to many PV customers. Retail rates that wrap all or most utility cost recovery needs into time-of-use (TOU) -based volumetric energy rates, and which exclude or limit demand-based charges, provide the most value to PV systems across a wide variety of circumstances. Expanding the availability of such rates will increase the value of many commercial PV systems. {sm_bullet} Offering commercial customers a variety of rate options would be of value to PV. Despite the advantages of energy-focused rates for PV, requiring the use of these tariffs would disadvantage some commercial PV installations. In particular, for PV systems that serve less than 25 - 50 % of annual customer load, the characteristics of the customer's underlying load profile often determine the most favorable rate structure, and energy-focused rate structures may not be ideal for many commercial-customer load shapes. Regulators that wish to establish rates that are beneficial to a range of PV applications should therefore consider allowing customers to choose from among a number of different rate structures. {sm_bullet} Eliminating net metering can significantly degrade the economics of PV systems that serve a large percentage of building load. Under the assumptions stipulated in this report, we find that an elimination of net metering could, in some circumstances, result in more than a 25 % loss in the rate-reduction value of commercial PV. As long as annual solar output is less than roughly 25 % of customer load and excess PV production can be sold to the local utility at a rate above $ 0. 05 /kWh, however, elimination of net metering is found to rarely result in a financial loss of greater than 5 % of the rate-reduction value of PV. More detailed conclusions on the rate-reduction value of commercial PV include: {sm_bullet} Commercial PV systems can sometimes greatly reduce demand charges. Though energy-focused retail rates often offer the greatest rate reduction value, commercial PV installations can generate significant reductions in demand charges, in some cases constituting 10 - 50 % of the total rate savings derived from PV installations. These savings, however, depend highly on the size of the PV system relative to building load, on the customer's load shape, and on the design of the <b>demand</b> <b>charge</b> itself. {sm_bullet} The value of <b>demand</b> <b>charge</b> reductions declines with PV system size. At high levels of PV penetration, the value of PV-induced <b>demand</b> <b>charge</b> savings on a $/kWh basis can drop substantially. As a result, the rate-reduction value of PV can decline by up to one-half when a PV system meets 75 % rather than 2 % of total building load. Thus, for rates with significant demand charges, the drop in <b>demand</b> <b>charge</b> savings dramatically reduces the overall rate reduction value of PV as system size increases relative to customer load. {sm_bullet} The ability of PV to offset demand charges is highly customer-specific. Customers with loads that peak in the afternoon are often able to receive significant <b>demand</b> <b>charge</b> savings across a wide variety of circumstances, at least at lower levels of PV output relative to building load. In contrast, facilities with flat or inverted load profiles will often not earn much <b>demand</b> <b>charge</b> reduction value, regardless of PV system size. {sm_bullet} The type of <b>demand</b> <b>charge</b> can impact the ability of PV to offer savings. Time-of-day (TOD) -based demand charges are found to be more favorable to PV under a broad range of (Abstract truncated...|$|E

Meanwhile, the charging energy for each EV is random. The goal is to minimize the mean waiting time of EVs under the long term constraint on the cost.
