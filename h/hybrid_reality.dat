40|$|The {{appeal of}} Pokémon Go is {{in large part}} due to the game’s {{introduction}} of locative augmented reality (AR) to popular media culture, as players’ mobile phones summon virtual creatures and overlay them on the immediate environment. The significance of this novel device (within popular children’s culture at least) is open to question however. The workings of imagination in children’s lives have always populated mundane experience with non-actual actions and characters – from elaborate fantasy worlds spun off in talk and gesture from play with dolls, building blocks or tree stumps and manhole covers (Factor 2004), the fleeting moments of jokes, songs and daydreams (Opie 1993), to intimate relationships with a precious toy or imaginary friend (Winnicott 1974). Over recent decades these processes have been mechanized and monetized by commercial children’s toy and media culture, not least in the transmedia system of Pokémon itself.

40|$|Our <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Reality</b> and Advanced Operations Lab is {{developing}} incredibly realistic and immersive systems {{that could be}} used to provide training, support engineering analysis, and augment data collection for various human performance metrics at NASA. To get a better understanding of what <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Reality</b> is, let's go through the two most commonly known types of immersive realities: Virtual Reality, and Augmented Reality. Virtual Reality creates immersive scenes that are completely made up of digital information. This technology has been used to train astronauts at NASA, used during teleoperation of remote assets (arms, rovers, robots, etc.) and other activities. One challenge with Virtual Reality is that if you are using it for real time-applications (like landing an airplane) then the information used to create the virtual scenes can be old (i. e. visualized long after physical objects moved in the scene) and not accurate enough to land the airplane safely. This is where Augmented Reality comes in. Augmented Reality takes real-time environment information (from a camera, or see through window, and places digitally created information into the scene so that it matches with the video/glass information). Augmented Reality enhances real environment information collected with a live sensor or viewport (e. g. camera, window, etc.) with the information-rich visualization provided by Virtual Reality. <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Reality</b> takes Augmented Reality even further, by creating a higher level of immersion where interactivity can take place. <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Reality</b> takes Virtual Reality objects and a trackable, physical representation of those objects, places them in the same coordinate system, and allows people to interact with both objects' representations (virtual and physical) simultaneously. After a short period of adjustment, the individuals begin to interact with all the objects in the scene as if they were real-life objects. The ability to physically touch and interact with digitally created objects that have the same shape, size, location to their physical object counterpart in virtual reality environment can be a game changer when it comes to training, planning, engineering analysis, science, entertainment, etc. Our Project {{is developing}} such capabilities for various types of environments.

40|$|Traditional {{critiques of}} {{computer}} {{and video games}} argue that the 'magic circle' defines the parameters of game-play, marking off a temporary world wherein particular game rules apply. In this view, {{to play a game}} means, materially or conceptually, 'entering' the magic circle of the game. Yet, increasingly, online multiplayer games, mobile location-based games (LBGs) and <b>hybrid</b> <b>reality</b> games (HRGs), erode the notion of a magic circle or dedicated game-space. In this paper I examine the hybrid ontologies and realities that typify networked and mobile location-based and <b>hybrid</b> <b>reality</b> games, exploring some of the phenomenological, embodied or somatic aspects of the practices and perceptions of 'mixed reality' gamers. A number of alternative corporeal and ontological metaphors for game worlds are proposed as substitutes for the magic circle, including the porous and organic cell membrane, the permeable window or frame, and the network. The composite, interconnected and dynamic ontology of the network trope, it is suggested, provides a more authentic figuration of the game environments specific to LBGs and HRGs, and also helps us to interpret the 'playful turn' in contemporary new media culture and the infiltration of a ludic sensibility into the mobilities and practices of everyday life...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Liver {{segmentation}} is {{an important}} prerequisite for planning of surgical interventions like liver tumor resections. For clinical applicability, the segmentation approach {{must be able to}} cope with the high variation in shape and gray-value appearance of the liver. In this paper we present a novel segmentation scheme based on a true 3 D segmentation refinement concept utilizing a <b>hybrid</b> desktop/virtual <b>reality</b> user interface. The method consists of two main stages. First, an initial segmentation is generated using graph cuts. Second, an interactive segmentation refinement step allows a user to fix arbitrary segmentation errors. We demonstrate the robustness of our method on ten contrast enhanced liver CT scans. Our segmentation approach copes successfully with the high variation found in patient data sets and allows to produce segmentations in a time-efficient manner. ...|$|R

In a comparison of two approaches to hybrid head pose refinement, we show that Quasi-Newton method enables high performance optimization for image space error minimization. Moreover, a 3 D landmark refinement step is proposed, which significantly improves quality and robustness of the overlay process. The enhanced system is demonstrated in an interactive AR environment, which provides accurate haptic feedback from real and virtual deformable objects. Finally, the effect of landmark occlusion on tracking stability during user interaction is also analyzed...|$|R
