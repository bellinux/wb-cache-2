5|$|An {{excavation}} of Southcote Manor in the 1960s uncovered many Roman, Romano-British and medieval artefacts such as sherds and pottery; {{a sample of}} the latter was <b>discovered</b> <b>to</b> have originated in Oxford in the 2nd century. Similarly, a Pannonian brooch and samian ware have been found in the area, and Roman pottery was found {{in the vicinity of the}} clay pits at Prospect Park Brick Works.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from some}} minor medical applications, the first {{commercial}} use was the daguerreotype. In 1840, bromine was <b>discovered</b> <b>to</b> have some advantages over the previously used iodine vapor to create the light sensitive silver halide layer in daguerreotypy.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{was long}} {{considered}} the element {{with the highest}} atomic mass that is stable. However, in 2003 it was <b>discovered</b> <b>to</b> be extremely weakly radioactive: its only primordial isotope, bismuth-209, decays via alpha decay with a half-life {{more than a billion}} times the estimated age of the universe. Because of its tremendously long half-life, bismuth may still be considered stable for almost all purposes.|$|E

5|$|C.mutica {{were also}} {{discovered}} in Ketchikan, Sitka, Juneau, Cordova, Kodiak, Kachemak Bay, Prince William Sound, and Unalaska in Alaska between 2000 and 2003. This {{was the first}} instance of a non-native marine species being found in the Aleutian Islands. In 2009, they were <b>discovered</b> <b>to</b> have spread into British Columbia, Canada. This indicates that C.mutica have completely expanded up the entire west coast of North America.|$|E
5|$|Far {{from being}} extinct, {{in recent years}} the Carménère grape has been <b>discovered</b> <b>to</b> be {{thriving}} in several areas outside France. In Chile, growers almost inadvertently preserved the grape variety during the last 150 years, due largely to its similarity to Merlot.|$|E
5|$|In May 2006, a sale of {{the seats}} from Arsenal F.C.'s old stadium, Highbury in London, England was {{cancelled}} when the seats were <b>discovered</b> <b>to</b> contain trace amounts of cadmium. Reports of high levels of cadmium use in children's jewelry in 2010 led to a US Consumer Product Safety Commission investigation. The U.S. CPSC issued specific recall notices for cadmium content in jewelry sold by Claire's and Wal-Mart stores.|$|E

5|$|In {{the gold}} rush of 1893, miners in Kalgoorlie {{discarded}} a pyritic material as they searched for pure gold, and {{it was used to}} fill in potholes and build sidewalks. In 1896, that tailing was <b>discovered</b> <b>to</b> be calaverite, a telluride of gold, and it sparked a second gold rush that included mining the streets.|$|E
5|$|Since {{different}} neuronal cell {{types are}} neatly organized into layers in the hippocampus, it has frequently {{been used as}} a model system for studying neurophysiology. The form of neural plasticity known as long-term potentiation (LTP) was first <b>discovered</b> <b>to</b> occur in the hippocampus and has often been studied in this structure. LTP is widely believed {{to be one of the}} main neural mechanisms by which memories are stored in the brain.|$|E

5|$|According to an Iranian {{radio station}} report, 200 villages {{sustained}} severe damage or were totally destroyed. The United States Geological Survey estimated that 10,533houses were destroyed; an additional 5,474 homes sustained {{varying degrees of}} damage. Fifty thousand people were left homeless. Local officials initially estimated {{the cost of the}} damage at $67million 1997 US$ (roughly 89.5million 2008 USD). The estimate was later raised to 100million 1997 USD (roughly 133.6million 2008 USD). One hundred schools and many health centers in the stricken areas were <b>discovered</b> <b>to</b> be in need of repair work.|$|E

5|$|After {{becoming}} a cause célèbre {{from the late}} 1960s to the 1980s, the mythical Priory of Sion was exposed as a ludibrium created by Plantard {{as a framework for}} his claim of being the Great Monarch prophesied by Nostradamus. Evidence presented in support of its historical existence and activities before 1956 was <b>discovered</b> <b>to</b> have been forged and then planted in various locations around France by Plantard and his accomplices. Nevertheless, many conspiracy theorists still persist in believing that the Priory of Sion is an age-old cabal that conceals a subversive secret.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of their {{inquiries}} into Smith's background, police launched an investigation into the death of a fourth woman who was <b>discovered</b> <b>to</b> have had links to him. Patricia Lynott, a 47-year-old divorced mother of two, had moved to Birmingham from Athlone during the mid-1990s. On 23 October 2000, while she was employed at the Rainbow as a cleaner and to look after the licensee's children, she was found dead in the bedroom of her flat on Maxstoke Street, Bordesley Green. Police believed at first that she had died of natural causes. An autopsy failed to establish a cause of death, and her body was returned to Ireland for burial.|$|E

5|$|C.mutica {{populations in}} Europe were first {{found in the}} Netherlands in 1995. During a species inventory, several {{specimens}} of an unknown caprellid were recovered by Platvoet et al. from artificial structures {{in and around the}} Neeltje-Jans and the Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier in Burghsluis, Zeeland. As with the case of the first discovery of C.mutica in North America, Platvoet et al. initially misidentified them as a new species. Remarking upon the resemblance of the caprellids to C.acanthogaster, they named it Caprella macho. They were later <b>discovered</b> <b>to</b> be introduced populations of C.mutica rather than a new species.|$|E

The route would involve the resettlement of Puerto de Caballos; it was planned to pass through the Indian settlement of Maniani, which Cerezeda planned to develop as a trading centre, and onwards to the Gulf of Fonseca.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Green Line {{south from}} L'Enfant Plaza began in July 1984 when WMATA issued {{a call for}} bids to tunnel under the Anacostia River. The firm of Harrison Western/Franki-Denys (a joint venture) was awarded the $25.6 million contract, with {{construction}} to begin in December 1984. WMATA delayed awarding the contract after American anti-apartheid activists alleged that a Belgian company with a minority financial interest in Franki-Denys did business with the racist white-led government of South Africa, but after the links were <b>discovered</b> <b>to</b> be extremely minor the contract was awarded.|$|E
