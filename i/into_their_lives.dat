25|$|It is {{rare for}} any Malaysian Chinese {{to be an}} {{absolute}} follower of a particular belief. Many nominally claim membership in a certain belief, yet respect beliefs from multiple religions <b>into</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> The Chinese traditional religion has become a strong influence in life, and new sects have arisen trying to integrate different religious teachings. Beliefs in Malaysia have also often adopted influence from local animism.|$|E
25|$|Counter-revolutionary women {{resisted}} {{what they}} saw as the intrusion of the state <b>into</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> Economically, many peasant women refused to sell their goods for assignats because this form of currency was unstable and was backed by the sale of confiscated Church property. By far the most important issue to counter-revolutionary women was the passage and the enforcement of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy in 1790. In response to this measure, women in many areas began circulating anti-oath pamphlets and refused to attend masses held by priests who had sworn oaths of loyalty to the Republic. These women continued to adhere to traditional practices such as Christian burials and naming their children after saints in spite of revolutionary decrees to the contrary.|$|E

25|$|The novel {{opens with}} Alhambra telling us of her {{conception}} in ‘the town’s only cinema’. We then come to “The Beginning”, {{which consists of}} a third-person narration focused first on Astrid, then Magnus, then Michael, then finally Eve. Through each character we obtain {{a different view of}} how Amber came <b>into</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> and who they believed her to be, when she arrived unannounced and uninvited at their Norfolk holiday home, claiming her car had broken down. Through “The Beginning”, we learn of Astrid’s obsession with video-taping her life, seemingly as proof it existed; of Magnus’ involvement in a school prank which resulted in the suicide of one of his classmates; of Michael’s affairs with his students (he is a university lecturer); and of Eve’s writer’s block.|$|E
500|$|Galatasaray manager Fatih Terim {{expressed}} his delight following his side's victory. He {{was interviewed by}} the Turkish press and dedicated the cup to Turkey and its public, particularly to those {{who lost their lives}} during the 1999 İzmit earthquake: [...] "Many people suffered terribly in the earthquake in Turkey last year and if this victory brings some happiness back <b>into</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> then I am delighted and so are all the players. We are very proud if we are able to help the Turkish people in some small way and this victory is for the whole country and all of the soccer fans in Turkey. I believe they were all united behind us." [...] Terim also praised his own players and Taffarel: [...] "I am proud and delighted he is in my team. He was magnificent and thoroughly deserved to be man of the match". Popescu, a former defender of Tottenham Hotspur, also indulged in the triumph and said: [...] "I am sure the fans at my old club are delighted as well!" ...|$|E
500|$|Starting in the 6th century, {{the farmers}} living in central Mesa Verde {{cultivated}} corn, beans, squash, and gourds. The combination {{of corn and}} beans provided the Mesa Verdeans with the amino acids of a complete protein. When conditions were good, [...] of land would provide enough food {{for a family of}} three or four individuals for one year, providing they supplemented with game and wild plants. As Mesa Verdeans increasingly relied on corn as a dietary staple, {{the success or failure of}} crop yields factored heavily <b>into</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> The mesa tilts slightly to the south, which increased its exposure to the sun. Before the introduction of pottery, foods were baked, roasted, and parched. Hot rocks dropped into containers could bring water to a brief boil, but because beans must be boiled for an hour or more their use was not widespread until after pottery had disseminated throughout the region. With the increased availability of ceramics after 600, beans became much easier to cook. This provided a high quality protein that reduced reliance on hunting. It also aided corn cultivation, as legumes add much needed nutrients to soils they are grown in, which likely increased corn yields.|$|E

500|$|The {{students}} {{attended a}} production and rehearsal {{meeting for the}} episode. The government of California gave Jefferson High School a grant to support a program to allow the students {{to be part of}} the filming and post-production of the episode. Film production company Screen Gems joined Montgomery and Asher in making donations to the program as well. The students donated the money they received for writing the episode to a foundation to keep the program going. Two more trips were organized, bringing a total of fifty Jefferson High School students to the set of Bewitched. Asher sent copies of thirty scripts of other Bewitched episodes to the school for use in classrooms. Saunders found the program a great success, saying [...] "kids who could never write before were now writing three pages. Kids who could not read were now doubling up on scripts and fighting over who would be able to play the leads." [...] Asher also expressed pleasure with the program's success, and recommended that other white businesspeople invite minority groups <b>into</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> Sargent considered Saunders the main reason for the success of the program, saying, [...] "She was interested in innovative forms of teaching. These kids, who might have been stuck in the ghetto for the rest of their lives, loved Bewitched, and with just a little approval and motivation, came alive on the set." ...|$|E
500|$|Psychodrama is {{an action}} method, {{often used as}} a psychotherapy, in which clients use {{spontaneous}} dramatization, role playing, and dramatic self-presentation to investigate and gain insight <b>into</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> [...] Developed by Jacob L. Moreno, psychodrama includes elements of theater, often conducted on a stage, or a space {{that serves as a}} stage area, where props can be used. [...] A psychodrama therapy group, under the direction of a licensed psychodramatist, reenacts real-life, past situations (or inner mental processes), acting them out in present time. Participants then have the opportunity to evaluate their behavior, reflect on how the past incident is getting played out in the present and more deeply understand particular situations in their lives. [...] Psychodrama offers a creative way for an individual or group to explore and solve personal problems. It may be used in a variety of clinical and community-based settings, and is most often utilized in a group setting, in which the members of the group serve as therapeutic agents for one another in the enacted drama. [...] Psychodrama is not, however, a form of group therapy, and is instead an individual psychotherapy that is executed from within a group. There are [...] "side-benefits" [...] that the other group members may experience, as they make relevant connections and insights to their own lives from the psychodrama of another. A psychodrama is best conducted and produced by a person trained in the method, called a psychodrama director.|$|E

She eventually confronts Henet, who in a fit of pique admits she hates Renisenb and hated Renisenb's long-deceased mother.|$|E
2500|$|Reconstructionist Judaism {{holds that}} {{contemporary}} Western secular morality has precedence over Jewish law and theology. It does not ask that its adherents hold {{to any particular}} beliefs, nor does it ask that halakha be accepted as normative. Unlike classical Reform Judaism, Reconstructionism holds that a person's default position should be to incorporate Jewish laws and tradition <b>into</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> unless they have a specific reason to do otherwise. The most important distinction between Reconstructionist Judaism and traditional Judaism is that Reconstructionism concludes that all halakha should be categorized as [...] "folkways" [...] and not as religious law.|$|E

2500|$|Kinkade {{said he was}} placing {{emphasis}} {{on the value of}} simple pleasures and that his intent was to communicate inspirational, life-affirming messages through his paintings.

He also said that his goal as an artist was to touch people of all faiths and to bring a sense of peace <b>into</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> through the images he created. Many pictures contain specific chapter-and-verse allusions to Bible passages.|$|E
2500|$|Rasmussen was unnerved {{by these}} visits and pleaded with Ruetten {{to tell her}} to stop coming by. Ruetten only said {{there was nothing to}} their {{relationship}} and that she should ignore Lazarus. According to Nels Rasmussen, Sherri's father, Lazarus later visited Rasmussen at her office. She allegedly claimed that things were not over between her and Ruetten and told Rasmussen, [...] "If I can't have John, no one else will." [...] Shortly before her death, Sherri again confided to her father her fear that Lazarus was stalking her on the street.

2500|$|Hutner {{developed}} {{a style of}} celebrating Shabbat and the Jewish holidays by delivering a type of discourse known as a ma'amar. It {{was a combination of}} Talmudic discourse, Hasidic celebration (tish), philosophic lecture, group singing, and when possible, like on Purim, a ten-piece band was brought in as accompaniment. Many times there was singing and dancing all night. All of this, together with the respect to his authority that he demanded, induced in his students an obedience and something of a [...] "heightened consciousness" [...] that passed <b>into</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> transforming them into literal Hasidim of their rosh yeshiva, who in turn encouraged this by eventually personally donning Hasidic garb (levush) and behaving like something of a synthesis between a rosh yeshiva and a rebbe. He also instructed some of his students to do likewise.|$|E
