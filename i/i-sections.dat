It {{is known that}} shear buckling load of a large span composite beam {{is difficult to determine}} experimentally. In order to sensitively detect shear buckling of the tested <b>I-section,</b> twenty strain rosettes and eight displacement sensors were applied and attached on the web and flange surfaces. The tested specimen was a pultruded composite beam made of vinylester resin, E-glass, carbon fibers and micro-fillers. Various coupon tests were performed before the shear buckling test to obtain fundamental material properties of the <b>I-section.</b> An asymmetric four-point bending loading scheme was utilized for the shear test. The loading scheme resulted in a high shear and almost zero moment condition {{at the center of the}} web panel. The shear buckling load was successfully determined after analyzing the obtained test data from strain rosettes and displacement sensors.

A total of five specimens with the same cross-section dimension were cast and tested using push-out test.

The experimental results show that the ultimate bond stress can be improved by a longer bond length and sand coating. However, the ultimate bond stress was reduced when stirrups were used, and the reason may be because the application of stirrups affected the vibration of the concrete, causing a weak bond at the interface.

Since the compressive forces are {{much higher than the}} tensile force, therefore the cross-section of the {{connecting rod}} is designed as a different cross section and the rankine formula is used. A connecting rod subjected to a cyclic as well as axial load W may buckle with x-axis as neutral axis in the plane of rotation of the connecting rod, or y-axis is a neutral axis In our analysis, Ansys Static Structural and Linear Buckling was used a model was developed on NX- 5.

The results show that converting <b>I-section</b> to X-cross section could reduce the slenderness ratio and increase a radius of gyration simultaneously. The slenderness ratio of the X-section is lower than that of <b>I-section</b> at the static load due to this strength and durability of connecting rod increases.

In these built up sections {{it has been}} common practice to use more steel in webs rather flanges. This results in uneconomical sections as steel is an expensive material. So introducing corrugated profile in web reduced the web instability and also the need for providing transverse stiffeners. But, even after in corrugated webs and lateral stiffeners, effects like lateral torsional buckling were observed. Thus measures other than providing conventional transverse stiffeners and corrugated webs were to be found.

40|$|Tbe study {{consists}} of an experimental and analytical investigation into the lateral buckling behaviour of steel <b>I-section</b> girders braced by continuous or discrete U-frames. Scaled down laboratory tests on twin <b>I-section</b> girders {{have been carried out}} under full instrumentation and are reported. Lateral deflection of the compression flanges and final buckling modes were recorded and the coupling effect of U-frame action is clearly demonstrated. The failure loads obtained were generally higher than the corresponding design values according to BS 5400. Using a large displacement elasto-plastic finite element package, ABAQUS, finite element idealisations of the tests were established and analysed. Good correlation between the experiments and the numerical analyses was reached. Validity of the ABAQUS package was confirmed and first order elements were sufficiently effective for the analysis. This was followed by further investigation of a wider range of <b>I-section</b> girders using ABAQUS. The ultimate bending resistance of the girders obtained from finite element analysis was in general greater than the corresponding design values to BS 5400, particularly so with girders of high slendemess. Thus the present design method is considered to be unduly conservative. The cause of this conservatism in BS 5400 is discussed. The expression for the calculation of effective length of U-frame braced girders was found to be reasonable. Based on the results from ABAQUS and reviews of the limited research directly related to this study, two main parameters in the BS 5400 expression for beam slenderness seem inappropriate for lateral buckling of an <b>I-section</b> girder under U-frame restraint. These are the radius of gyration of the whole girder section and the ratio of overall depth of a girder to mean flange thickness. Instead, radius of gyration of the compression flange together with a contribution from the adjoining web section was found to be more appropriate as also was the web slenderness. In addition, a modification is proposed to the present limiting stress curve for lateral buckling of bare steel <b>I-section</b> girders. Empirically derived factors have been introduced. The general procedures in the existing design method to BS 5400 remain similar, however. ...|$|R

Two grades of stainless steel were considered, namely the austenitic grade EN 1. 4301 and the duplex grade EN 1. 4462. Using the sectioning method, the test specimens were divided into strips. The residual stresses were then computed by multiplying the strains relieved during sectioning by the measured Young??s moduli determined from tensile and compressive coupon tests.
