25|$|Similarly, {{psychiatrist}} David Spiegel {{said that}} the inclusion of Landis' 1956 study was unjustified. He argued that, while weighting larger studies more than smaller makes sense, combining {{the results of a}} large study examining very mild trauma (such as fending off an attacker) with studies of long-term physical and sexual abuse was inappropriate and led to erroneous conclusions. Rind et al. replied that Spiegel misrepresented their analysis, since they did not use Landis' study <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meta-analysis</b> of childhood sexual abuse – symptom correlations, but only for examining the self-reported effects of CSA. They contend that the way they handled Landis' data maximized negative reports and minimized the possible deflating effect of Landis' data on the overall effect sizes.|$|E
25|$|A low {{socioeconomic}} status in a deprived neighborhood may include exposure to “environmental stressors and risk factors.” Socioeconomic inequalities are commonly {{measured by the}} Cartairs-Morris score, Index of Multiple Deprivation, Townsend deprivation index, and the Jarman score. The Jarman score, for example, considers “unemployment, overcrowding, single parents, under-fives, elderly living alone, ethnicity, low social class and residential mobility.” In Vos’ meta-analysis these indices are used to view the effect of low SES neighborhoods on maternal health. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>meta-analysis,</b> data from individual studies were collected from 1985 up until 2008. Vos concludes that a correlation exists between prenatal adversities and deprived neighborhoods. Other {{studies have shown that}} low SES is closely associated with the development of the fetus in utero and growth retardation. Studies also suggest that children born in low SES families are “likely to be born prematurely, at low birth weight, or with asphyxia, a birth defect, a disability, fetal alcohol syndrome, or AIDS.” Bradley and Corwyn also suggest that congenital disorders arise from the mother’s lack of nutrition, a poor lifestyle, maternal substance abuse and “living in a neighborhood that contains hazards affecting fetal development (toxic waste dumps).” In a meta-analysis that viewed how inequalities influenced maternal health, it was suggested that deprived neighborhoods often promoted behaviors such as smoking, drug and alcohol use. After controlling for socioeconomic factors and ethnicity, several individual studies demonstrated an association with outcomes such as perinatal mortality and preterm birth.|$|E

40|$|Cueing {{facilitates}} {{retention and}} transfer of multimedia learning. From {{the perspective of}} cognitive load theory (CLT), cueing has {{a positive effect on}} learning outcomes because of <b>the</b> reduction <b>in</b> total cognitive load and avoidance of cognitive overload. However, this has not been systematically evaluated. Moreover, what remains ambiguous is the direct relationship between the cue-related cognitive load and learning outcomes. A meta-analysis and two subsequent meta-regression analyses were conducted to explore these issues. Subjective total cognitive load (SCL) and scores on a retention test and transfer test were selected as dependent variables. Through a systematic literature search, 32 eligible articles encompassing 3, 597 participants were included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SCL-related <b>meta-analysis.</b> Among them, 25 articles containing 2, 910 participants were included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> retention-related <b>meta-analysis</b> and <b>the</b> following retention-related meta-regression, while there were 29 articles containing 3, 204 participants included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> transfer-related <b>meta-analysis</b> and <b>the</b> transfer-related meta-regression. <b>The</b> <b>meta-analysis</b> revealed a statistically significant cueing effect on subjective ratings of cognitive load (d = - 0. 11, 95 % CI = [- 0. 19, - 0. 02], p < 0. 05), retention performance (d = 0. 27, 95 % CI = [0. 08, 0. 46], p < 0. 01), and transfer performance (d = 0. 34, 95 % CI = [0. 12, 0. 56], p < 0. 01). The subsequent meta-regression analyses showed that dSCL for cueing significantly predicted dretention for cueing (β = - 0. 70, 95 % CI = [- 1. 02, - 0. 38], p < 0. 001), as well as dtransfer for cueing (β = - 0. 60, 95 % CI = [- 0. 92, - 0. 28], p < 0. 001).
