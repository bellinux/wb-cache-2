It {{was introduced in}} 1966 by Bayer to combat blast fungus and Pellicularia sasakii in rice cultivation. It was never authorized {{for use in the}} EU.|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Edifenphos,</b> {{a kind of}} {{organophosphate}} toxins, is used as agricultural fungicides in rice fields. This {{study was}} aimed to investigate the effect of temperature on lethal concentration of exposure to <b>edifenphos</b> on Rutilus frisii kutum (Caspian kutum). Methods: The experiment {{was carried out in}} static condition and based on instructions of OECD within 10 d under controlled water physicochemical factors. Dissolved oxygen was fixed on 7 - 7. 5 ppm, pH: 7 to 7. 5 and hardness: 200 ppm. Fish were acclimatized in 70 * 40 * 30 cm aquarium for 10 d before the test. Treated aquariums with concentrations of 0. 01, 0. 05, 2, 4, 8, 16 ppm of <b>edifenphos</b> with one control group (no toxic concentration), were performed. In order to test the effect of temperature on acute toxicity, three ranges of 15 ± 1, 20 ± 1 and 25 ± 1 ºC were treated and LC 1, LC 10, LC 30, LC 50, LC 70, LC 90 and LC 99 were calculated for 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. The study was carried out in Laboratory of Aquaculture and Fisheries, University of Tehran in 2016. Results: LC 50 value in 25 ºC was lower than 20 and 15 ºC. LC 50 96 h <b>edifenphos</b> for Caspian kutum in 15 ± 1, 20 ± 1 and 25 ± 1 ºC was 3. 70, 3. 61 and 3. 26, respectively. Conclusion: Higher temperature increase toxicity rate of <b>edifenphos</b> and the toxin had a positive temperature coefficient on Caspian kutum. ...|$|E
40|$|Membrane-bound chitin synthase from FuscUium graminearum A 315 had a pH optimum of 6. 5, an {{apparent}} temperature optimum of 30 "C and {{an apparent}} K,,, for UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) of 2. 5 mM. Digitonin-solubilized chitin synthase {{had a lower}} (about 25 % of the original activity) and more variable activity than the membrane-bound chitin synthase from which it was prepared. The activity of solubilized chitin synthase was stabilized by incorporating Allosamidin (a chitinase inhibitor) into the reaction mixture, and an approximately 3. 6 -fold increase in activity was observed when the reaction mixture contained dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine. Concentrations of the organophosphorus fungicide <b>edifenphos</b> (Hinosan) up to 25 p ~ {{had no effect on}} the in vitro activity of membrane-bound chitin synthase, but between 25 and 145 p ~, chitin synthase activity decreased with increase in fungicide concentration. <b>Edifenphos</b> caused non-competitive inhibition of chitin synthase activity with an apparent Ki of 50 PM. Membrane-bound chitin synthase preparations from cultures of F. graminearurn grown in 250 pM-edifenphos had a much lower in vitro activity than preparations from cultures grown {{in the absence of the}} fungicide. Pre-growth of F. grdnearum in 250 p ~ (but not 80 p ~) <b>edifenphos</b> also caused a reduction in incorporation of [3 H]GlcNAc into chitin in uivo (washed biomass was incubated in [3 H]GlcNAc-containing medium lacking fungicide) ...|$|E
40|$|Silicon (Si) {{has been}} shown to {{suppress}} diseases of rice such as blast when applied to Si-deficient soils. In 1995 and 1996, Si was applied at 1, 000 kg ha- 1 to at two locations in eastern Colombia to determine if Si combined with reduced rates of fungicide could be used to manage leaf and neck blast effectively in upland rice. Two applications of <b>edifenphos</b> and three applications of tricyclazole were made at 0, 10, 25, or 100 % of their labeled rates after amendment of soil with Si. At both locations, Si alone and Si combined with <b>edifenphos</b> reduced leaf blast severity by 22 to 75 % when compared with nonamended, untreated controls, and suppression of leaf blast by Si alone was equal to or better than the full rate of <b>edifenphos</b> alone. Si alone suppressed neck blast as effectively or better than the full rate tricyclazole when severity was low; however, when severity was higher, a 10 % rate of tricyclazole was needed in addition to Si. No differences in yield were observed between Si without fungicides and fungicides (full rate) without Si. Applications of Si made in 1995 had significant residual activity in terms of disease control and yield in 1996. The application of Si to Si-deficient soils may permit the use of reduced rates of fungicide to manage leaf and neck blast in upland rice. Peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the systemic fungicides in the sixties, the phenomenon of resistance to these compounds has become a serious problem in the control of fungal plant diseases. The aim {{of this study was to}} contribute to the knowledge about the consequences of fungicide applications in cereals with respect to the emergence of fungicide resistant strains of Septorianodorum, the causal agent of glume blotch of wheat, and of Cercosporellaherpotrichoides, the causal agent of eyespot of wheat, barley and rye. CHAPTER 3. An accurate and reproducible inoculation method was used to inoculate wheat seedlings with spore suspensions of S. nodorum. The effect of postinfectional applications of the systemic fungicides carbendazim and <b>edifenphos</b> with respect to the development of symptoms and the length of the latent period was studied. Both fungicides suppressed the development of symptoms and elongated the duration of the latent period, the extent to which depending on the concentration of each fungicide used. CHAPTER 4. It is suggested that alternate or combined use of two systemic fungicides with a different mode of action can reduce the enrichment of specific resistant forms in a fungal population. To verify these statements, model experiments were carried out under controlled conditions. During 9 passages on living wheat plants, inoculated with spore suspensions of S. nodorum, the fungicides carbendazim and <b>edifenphos</b> were applied either alone or as a mixture in each passage, or applied alternately from passage to passage. After 9 passages, disease control by either fungicide alone was reduced. This tendency was not so pronounced in that variant where the fungicides were applied alternately and nearly absent in that variant where a mixture was applied. Comparable results were obtained in experiments on agar media. A stable <b>edifenphos</b> resistant strain was selected in that variant, where S. nodorum in each passage was cultured on plates with <b>edifenphos.</b> With C. herpotrichoides, experiments were carried out on agar media only, using carbendazim and nuarimol. Here, a strong effect of the alternate exposure of the fungus to these two compounds was present. since the fungus was hardly able to grow on plates with a moderate dosis of carbendazim, after first being cultured on plates with nuarimol. CHAPTER 5. The effect of field applications of thiophanate methyl and <b>edifenphos</b> on the frequency of resistant spores in field isolates of S. nodorum was examined, during five vegetation periods between 1973 and 1977. Two types of carbendazim resistant strains were present in S. nodorum. Weakly carbendazim resistant strains were inhibited at 5 μg/ml carbendazim in vitro and occured at a frequency of about 1 : 7 x 10 6 in populations from unsprayed plots. Highly carbendazim resistant strains occurred at a frequency of about 100 times that low and were hardly inhibited at 1000 μg/ml carbendazim in vitro. In each year, there was a significant increase in the frequency of weakly carbendazim resistant spores after thiophanate methyl applications in the field. but the absolute figures remained rather low. In no case, an isolate with more than 1 : 10 4 weakly resistant spores was found. There was no clear yearly increase in the frequency of highly carbendazim resistant spores after thiophanate methyl application. <b>Edifenphos</b> resistant spores were present in field isolates of S. nodorum. Their frequency- about 1 : 10 7 in isolates from unsprayed plots-, increased significantly after <b>edifenphos</b> application in the field, but the absolute figures remained rather low. During three years, field trials were carried out with C. herpotrichoides to examine the effect of carbendazim application in the field on the frequency of carbendazim resistant spores in field isolates. Their frequency in isolates from unsprayed plots was about 1 : 7 x 10 8 . This frequency increased after carbendazim applications, but mostly on an insignificant scale only. CHAPTER 6. Fungicide sensitive and resistant strains of S. nodorum were compared with respect to their mycelial growth rate, their sporulation capacity and their pathogenicity on agar medium and/or living wheat plants. Weakly carbendazim resistant strains showed a significantly faster mycelial growth on agar media with carbendazim, than sensitive ones, but were almost completely inhibited at 5 μg/ml carbendazim. This growth reduction was accompaniedby an increase in the number of spores, produced per mm 2 mycelium. Highly carbendazim resistant strains were able to grow and produce spores at 1000 μg/ml carbendazim in vitro. Resistant strians were present with a mycelial growth and spore production equal to that of sensitive ones. Pathogenicity tests with sensitive and highly carbendazim resistant strains on living wheat plants showed the same tendency, as far as the development of symptoms and sporeproduction is concerned. <b>Edifenphos</b> resistant strains of S. nodorum were compared with sensitive ones in tests on agar media and on wheat plants. Resistant strains were strongly inhibited at 200 μg/ml <b>edifenphos</b> in vitro. <b>Edifenphos</b> resistant strains were present with an equal fitness as sensitive ones, when grown in the absence of <b>edifenphos,</b> on agar media and on living wheat plants. The tests with C. herpotrichoides were performed with sensitive mother strains and the corresponding carbendazim. resistant daughter strains. These resistant strains were able to grow and produce spores even at 1000 μg/ml carbendazim in vitro. They produced more spores per mm 2 mycelium when cultured in the presence of carbendazim than in its absence. The properties of carbendazim resistant strains in vitro and in vivo did not differ very much from those of sensitive strains, in the absence of the fungicide. CHAPTER 7. The competitive ability of resistant strains was studied by inoculating wheat plants with different mixtures of resistant and sensitive spores. Carbendazim resistant strains of S. nodorum and C. herpotrichoides could maintain themselves in the mixed population for three passages on wheat plants, even in the absence of any fungicide selection pressure. In case of a postinfectional fungicide application, only carbendazim resistant strains could be reisolated. <b>Edifenphos</b> resistant strains disappeared from the respective populations in the absence of the fungicide, due to a smaller relative reproduction ratio...|$|E
