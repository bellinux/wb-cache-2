25|$|Most of the world's {{high energy}} {{resources}} {{are from the}} conversion of the sun's rays to other energy forms after being incident upon the planet. Some of that energy has been preserved as <b>fossil</b> <b>energy,</b> some is directly or indirectly usable; for example, via solar PV/thermal, wind, hydro- or wave power. The total solar irradiance is measured by satellite to be roughly 1361 watts per square meter (see solar constant), though it fluctuates by about 6.9% during the year due to the Earth's varying distance from the sun. This value, after multiplication by the cross-sectional area intercepted by the Earth, is the total rate of solar energy received by the planet; about half, 89,000TW, reaches the Earth's surface.|$|E

50|$|Various {{researchers}} have undertaken extensive life cycle assessments of biodegradable polymers {{to determine whether}} these materials are more energy efficient than polymers made by conventional fossil fuel-based means. Research done by Gerngross, et al. estimates that the <b>fossil</b> fuel <b>energy</b> required to produce a kilogram of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) is 50.4 MJ/kg, which coincides with another estimate by Akiyama, et al., who estimate a value between 50-59 MJ/kg. This information {{does not take into}} account the feedstock energy, which can be obtained from non-fossil fuel based methods. Polylactide (PLA) was estimated to have a <b>fossil</b> fuel <b>energy</b> cost of 54-56.7 from two sources, but recent developments in the commercial production of PLA by NatureWorks has eliminated some dependence of <b>fossil</b> fuel-based <b>energy</b> by supplanting it with wind power and biomass-driven strategies. They report making a kilogram of PLA with only 27.2 MJ of <b>fossil</b> fuel-based <b>energy</b> and anticipate that this number will drop to 16.6 MJ/kg in their next generation plants. In contrast, polypropylene and high-density polyethylene require 85.9 and 73.7 MJ/kg, respectively, but these values include the embedded energy of the feedstock because it is based on fossil fuel.|$|R

[...] Department of Economics and Social Science Consortium. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2017 This dissertation investigates {{the relationship between}} economic growth and <b>fossil</b> fuel <b>energy</b> consumption through three interrelated chapters—each of which addresses a facet of the relationship. The first chapter argues that mainstream explanations for Industrial Revolution generally assign a pride of place to institutional—secure property rights—and technological innovations—the steam engine. Using interdisciplinary sources, this chapter shows that mainstream explanations are based on narrow empirics. More importantly, this chapter shows that switching from water to <b>fossil</b> fuel-based <b>energy</b> sources during the Industrial Revolution was not based on economic considerations since water was neither scarce nor more expensive than coal. Placing the Glorious Revolution on the same historical continuum as the Industrial Revolution—through their common link with the Enclosure Movement—this chapter argues that the real reasons behind switching to fossil fuels were political-economic. The second chapter argues {{that the relationship between}} economic growth and <b>fossil</b> fuel <b>energy</b> consumption has not been thoroughly investigated in the case of emerging economies. Building on the understanding obtained via economic history accounts, this chapter argues that the relationship between economic growth and <b>fossil</b> fuel <b>energy</b> consumption is structurally different in emerging economies. This chapter traces the linkages between economic growth and <b>fossil</b> fuel <b>energy</b> consumption in emerging economies, highlighting the role played by various economic, structural and technological factors. This chapter also shows that emerging economies—net energy importers, to be specific—face unique macroeconomic challenges in the shape of balance-of-payments crises and financial instability that stem from sudden and severe increases in their energy import bills. The third chapter empirically examines the relationship between economic growth and <b>fossil</b> fuel <b>energy</b> consumption growth in a sample of 35 net energy-importing emerging economies. Results show that in the sample of 35 emerging economies, economic growth Granger causes <b>fossil</b> fuel <b>energy</b> consumption growth in the period 1981 - 2013. Country-level scatter plots also indicate that in the sample of 35 emerging economies, the relationship between real GDP per capita and <b>fossil</b> fuel <b>energy</b> consumption per capita is linear when using K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm—and not curvilinear as postulated by the environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{addresses the}} future energy {{situation with the}} expected reduction of <b>fossil</b> primary <b>energy</b> supply and increasing market segments by renewable energies within the next decades. The potential of renewable energies to cover the energy demand is described {{as well as the}} necessity of energy storage systems (especially hydrogen) to compensate the fluctuations of primary energy sources. Furthermore the increasing use of renewable vehicle fuels is investigated with special focus on hydrogen in short and long-term considerations. As a result the paper will show an energy supply gap between decreasing <b>fossil</b> <b>energies</b> and increasing renewable energies which can only be bridged by a more efficient general use of energy. Hydrogen will be proven as best synthetic fuel by “well-to-wheel analysis” both with respect to energy efficiency, to environmental analysis as well as to customer satisfaction...|$|R

2500|$|The {{positive}} impact on the environment globally is less clear. [...] Hans-Werner Sinn, a German economist and chair of the Ifo Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung argues that Germany's renewable energy support reduces world market prices for <b>fossil</b> <b>energy.</b> [...] Thus, countries like China or the US have an incentive to produce more, and the net effect on the climate is zero.

2500|$|Energy {{harvesting}} is {{most often}} more effective (in cost and resource utilization) when done on a local but combined scale, for example, a group of houses, cohousing, local district, village, etc. rather than an individual basis. [...] An energy benefit of such localized energy harvesting is the virtual elimination of electrical transmission and electricity distribution losses. These losses amount to about 7.2%–7.4% of the energy transferred. Energy harvesting in commercial and industrial applications should benefit from the topography of each location. [...] The production of goods under net zero <b>fossil</b> <b>energy</b> consumption requires locations of geothermal, microhydro, solar, and wind resources to sustain the concept.|$|E

Standard advantages also include no air pollution and no temperature increase of endangered natural water bodies from power plant cooling-water discharge.
