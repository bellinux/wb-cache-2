This rezoning allowed for greater density of development, and {{combined with an}} <b>increased</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> housing, these areas experienced a boom {{in the construction of}} tall buildings. In addition to Downtown Brooklyn, high-rise buildings are also concentrated in the Fort Greene and Williamsburg neighborhoods, although other Brooklyn neighborhoods have significant numbers of high-rises.|$|E
5|$|Han Chinese culture percolated {{into the}} newly conquered territories and the conquered Baiyue and Dian tribes were {{eventually}} assimilated or {{displaced by the}} Han Empire. Han dynasty influences are apparent in artifacts excavated in the Baiyue tombs of modern southern China. This sphere of influence eventually extended to various ancient Southeast Asian kingdoms, where contact led {{to the spread of}} Han Chinese culture, trade and political diplomacy. The <b>increased</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> Chinese silk also led to the establishment of the Silk Road trade routes connecting Ancient Europe, the Near East, and China.|$|E

Four metals were mined commercially in England during the period, namely iron, tin, lead and silver; coal was also mined from the 13th century onwards, using a variety of refining techniques.|$|E
5|$|The linen {{industry}} was {{widespread in the}} Fylde during the 18thcentury and Poulton's importation of flax was essential. There were large warehouses at Skippool and Wardleys, owned by linen merchants from Kirkham. By the 19thcentury, craftsmen in Poulton were {{an important part of}} the industry. In the early part of the 19thcentury, there was a significant decline in the craft industries because of increased mechanisation, as well as <b>increased</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> labour. In contrast to neighbouring Kirkham, Poulton appeared to suffer from a lack of enthusiasm for new industrial techniques and opportunities among its industry leaders.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} trishaw {{services}} although this service is dying fast {{and is not}} as extensive as {{the ones in the}} states of Malacca and Penang. In Kuala Terengganu, pedestrian-pulled rickshaws were gradually replaced by trishaws (beca in Malay). Trishaws were ubiquitous up to the 1970s in cities. Since then, rapid urbanisation has <b>increased</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> more efficient public transport, resulting in dwindling trishaw numbers. Today, trishaws are operated mostly as a tourist attraction in Kuala Terengganu. The city's only taxi rank stands nearby to the city's bus terminal.|$|E

5|$|Anaemia {{is a major}} {{global health}} problem for women. Women are {{affected}} more than men, in which up to 30% of women being found to be anaemic and 42% of pregnant women. Anaemia is linked {{to a number of}} adverse health outcomes including a poor pregnancy outcome and impaired cognitive function (decreased concentration and attention). The main cause of anaemia is iron deficiency. In United States women iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) affects 37% of pregnant women, but globally the prevalence is as high as 80%. IDA starts in adolescence, from excess menstrual blood loss, compounded by the <b>increased</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> iron in growth and suboptimal dietary intake. In the adult woman, pregnancy leads to further iron depletion.|$|E
5|$|Early {{housing in}} the village {{consisted}} of groups of thatched cottages clustered around and near the parish church. The influx of workers from areas around the village accompanied an <b>increased</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> extra housing. Even after {{the establishment of the}} local board of health new properties were often built in the gardens of existing dwellings, leading to severe overcrowding. In 1852 the streets were paved with boulders, sewerage was non-existent, and water supply was a local well. During {{the latter half of the}} 19th century new housing was erected alongside the railway, and large areas of open land were soon occupied with new housing estates built for the area's more wealthy residents.|$|E
5|$|Law {{enforcement}} officers often receive inquiries and demands about their investigations that stem from unrealistic portrayals on television. In a 2010 survey of Canadian police officers, some were frustrated by these CSI-affected queries, though most {{saw them as}} opportunities {{to inform the public}} about real police work. New technologies and the increased public awareness of forensic science have stimulated new interest in solving cold cases and encouraged higher accountability among police investigators. However, the <b>increased</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> forensic evidence can cause an unmanageable workload for forensic laboratories. Some crime labs process several thousand cases every year. Many law enforcement agencies have insufficient storage space for the increasing amount of physical evidence they collect. In some investigations, DNA evidence is not collected simply because there is not enough space to store it properly.|$|E

5|$|The Belgian Air Force ordered five Sea King Mk.48s {{to perform}} Search and Rescue {{missions}} in 1974, which entered service in 1976. They were upgraded with new rotor blades in 1987–1988, and with revised avionics, including new radar and provision of a FLIR turret under the nose from 1995. In 2007 Belgium ordered eight NH90 helicopters in 2007, of which four were navalised NFH helicopters intended {{to replace the}} Sea Kings in the SAR role. Delays in delivery of Belgium's NH90s, together with an <b>increased</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> on the NH90s to operate from the Belgian Navy's frigates, {{has resulted in the}} retirement date for the Sea Kings being pushed back to at least 2018. Three Sea Kings remain operational as of 2017. Belgian Sea Kings had been carried out over 3300 SAR sorties by the end of 2016, with over 1750 lives saved.|$|E
5|$|The {{barndoor}} skate {{is one of}} five skates in the Gulf of Maine that has commercial value, but of those, the species that are most frequently targeted are the winter skate (Leucoraja ocellata) and the thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata). The {{barndoor skate}} is most commonly considered by-catch by commercial trawlers operating in the northwestern Atlantic that target other commercially valuable species of fish using bottom trawling. When harvested, the flesh of the barndoor skate is used as bait, fish meal, pet food, and the meat from its wings is sold for human consumption. Since 1981, landings of skates have increased substantially, partly in response to <b>increased</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> lobster bait, and more significantly, to the increased export market for skate wings. Currently, commercial retention and sale of barndoor skate is prohibited in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of the Silk Road occurred during Wu's reign, owing {{to the efforts of}} the diplomat Zhang Qian. The <b>increased</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> silk from the Roman Empire stimulated commercial traffic in both Central Asia and across the Indian Ocean. Roman merchants sailed to Barbarikon near present-day Karachi, Pakistan, and Barygaza in present-day Gujarat, India to purchase Chinese silks (see Roman trade with India). When Emperor Wu conquered Nanyue—in what is now Southwest China and northern Vietnam—in 111 BC, overseas trade was extended to Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean, as maritime merchants traded Han gold and silk for pearls, jade, lapis lazuli, and glasswares.|$|E

While prior evidence suggests that different cortical regions are preferentially engaged by these two attentional processes, the effect of <b>increasing</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> {{conflict detection}} and ⁄ or allocation of attentional resources has been relatively unexplored. We designed a novel task (the ‘variable attentional control’ – VAC – task) that varies the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> attentional control by increasing conflict detection and allocation of attentional resources within the same stimuli. We studied 34 subjects who underwent event-related {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} while performing the VAC task. <b>Increasing</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> attentional control, as reflected by longer reaction time and reduced accuracy, was associated with greater activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex and dorsal cingulate. Furthermore, an increase in conflict detection was associated with greater dorsal cingulate activity, whereas an <b>increase</b> in <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> allocation of attentional resources implied greater activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal cortices. In essence, in addition to allowing the exploration of the overall effects of <b>increasing</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> attentional control, our novel task also allowed parsing of the neural components of attentional control into those related to allocation of attentional resources and those related to conflict detection...|$|R

5|$|Approximately 300,000 horses {{existed in}} Finland when the Finnhorse {{studbook}} {{was established in}} the beginning of the 20thcentury. The horse population, consisting almost entirely of Finnhorses, remained stable for 50 years. The rebuilding of the country after two wars had <b>increased</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> horse power, and by the 1950s, the breed reached its all-time peak, with an estimated 409,000 animals, with a great majority of the horses being of the draught type. However, with the increased mechanisation of agriculture and forestry in the 1960s, the number of Finnhorses dropped precipitously. Horses, having been bred in large numbers only a few years earlier, were taken to slaughter by the thousands; a change in forestry tax policy made previously state-supported horse-powered forestry unprofitable and further discouraged keeping horses. Many working horse bloodlines ended, while lines more suitable for sports and recreation survived. By the 1970s, the breed's numbers had declined to 90,000 animals, and 10 years later as few as 20,000 Finnhorses existed. The breed's all-time lowest point was 1987, with only 14,100 horses. By this time, however, the overall horse population in Finland had been increasing for almost a decade, with lighter harness racing horse breeds establishing their position, counting 12,800 animals the same year.|$|E
