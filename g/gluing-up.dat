40|$|New version. Appeared in "Revista de la Real Academia de Ciencias Exactas, Fisicas y Naturales, Serie A Matematicas", October 2012 (Electronic) This paper proposes some {{material}} towards {{a theory of}} general toric varieties without the assumption of normality. Their combinatorial description involves a fan to which is attached a set of semigroups subjected to <b>gluing-up</b> conditions. In particular it contains a combinatorial construction of the blowing up of a sheaf of monomial ideals on a toric variety. In the second part it is shown that over an algebraically closed base field of zero characteristic the Semple-Nash modification of a general toric variety is isomorphic to the blowing up of the sheaf of logarithmic jacobian ideals and that in any characteristic this blowing-up is an isomorphism {{if and only if}} the toric variety is non singular. In the second part we prove that orders on the lattice of monomials (toric valuations) of maximal rank are uniformized by iterated Sempla-Nash modifications...|$|E
