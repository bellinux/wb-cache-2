5|$|By 1906, Irwin was {{manager of}} the Altoona Mountaineers in the Tri-State League. In July 1907, Irwin {{resigned}} as {{manager of the}} Mountaineers after fans became disgruntled. Even after entering baseball scouting, Irwin briefly managed the 1908 Washington club in the short-lived Union Professional League. The league was plagued by financial problems—including the <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> players at times—and it folded {{less than two months}} after play began. He was rehired to the Penn coaching staff in 1908.|$|E
5|$|In 1605 Charles, now Charles IX, the King of Sweden, {{launched}} a new offensive, but his efforts were crossed by Chodkiewicz's victories at Kircholm and elsewhere and the Polish naval successes, while the war continued without a decisive resolution being produced. In the armistice of 1611 the Commonwealth {{was able to keep}} the majority of the contested areas, as a variety of internal and foreign difficulties, including the <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the mercenary soldiers and the Union's new involvement in Russia, precluded a comprehensive victory.|$|E
5|$|Due to an archaic law in Erie County, {{the town}} of Tonawanda and {{the town of}} Amherst, who {{completed}} the road in 1925, were requested in 1935 to take over $2million (1935USD) in debts bonded for its construction. The county noted that the towns' <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for the road made the new road a financial burden for the county. To make things worse, the new road did not bring the immediate influx of business that was advertised and was looking early on as a giant mistake {{on the part of the}} county and towns.|$|E
50|$|Debt bondage only {{applies to}} {{individuals}} who have no hopes of leaving the labor due <b>to</b> <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> ever <b>pay</b> debt back. Those who offer their services to repay a debt and the employer reduces the debt accordingly are not in debt bondage.|$|R
40|$|Attention deficit {{hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) is mental disorder commonly characterized by <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>paying</b> attention, as well as excessive activity and/or <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> control ones behavior. As such ADHD can often {{have a negative impact}} on the lives of those affected especially young children. Not only that but ADHD is misunderstood and stigmatized in several cultures and demographics. While various management strategies exist with the most common being medication and behavior therapy. This literature review looks to compare treatments received by patients in various parts of the world as well as the perceptions toward ADHD and the management process across cultures and socio-economic groups. This could give us a better understanding of why certain people chose one treatment option over another and could also help us gain a better understanding of various stigmas and false beliefs individuals may have regarding ADHD management...|$|R

5|$|In 1875, Goldfaden {{headed for}} Munich, {{intending}} to study medicine. This {{did not work}} out, and he headed for Lvov/Lemberg in Galicia, where he again met up with Linetsky, now editor of a weekly paper, Isrulik or Der Alter Yisrulik (which was well reputed, but was soon shut by the government). A year later, {{he moved on to}} Chernivtsi in Bukovina, where he edited the Yiddish-language daily Dos Bukoviner Israelitishe Folksblatt. The limits of the economic sense of this enterprise can be gauged from his <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> a registration fee of 3000 ducats. He tried unsuccessfully to operate the paper under a different name, but soon moved on to Iaşi on the invitation of Isaac Librescu (1850–1930), a young wealthy communitary activist interested in theatre.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{completion}} of the reconquista, the defeated Muslims were generally given freedom of religion as terms of their surrender. For example, the Treaty of Granada, which governed the surrender of the emirate, guaranteed a set of rights to the conquered Muslims, including religious tolerance and fair treatment, in return for their capitulation. The increasing occurrences of forced conversion triggered a series of Muslim rebellions in Granada (1499–1501). The rebellions were suppressed, and afterwards the Muslims in Granada were no longer given the rights that had been provided to them by the Treaty of Granada. They were given the choice to remain and accept baptism, to reject baptism and be enslaved or killed, or to be exiled. The option of exile was often not feasible in practice because of the difficulty in uprooting one's family and making the journey to Muslim lands in North Africa, the <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the fee required by the authorities for safe passage, and the general tendency by the authorities to discourage and hinder such an exodus.|$|E
5|$|The {{flagship}} Bonwit Teller store {{remained as}} one of Trump Tower's retail offerings until March 1990, when Bonwit Teller's parent company declared bankruptcy and closed the Trump Tower location. In July of that year, Galeries Lafayette {{announced that it would}} sign a 25-year lease to move into the space previously occupied by Bonwit Teller, a move that expanded Galeries Lafayette's business to the United States while helping Trump pay off the debts incurred by the tower's construction and operation. The new store opened in September 1991 after a $13.7 million renovation, but was unprofitable upon opening, losing a net $3.6 million in the first year alone because it had only made $8.4 million in sales. Galeries Lafayette announced that it would be closing the Trump Tower location in August 1994, less than three years after it opened, due to an <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> off the $8 million annual rent and taxes. However, critics cited other factors, including the decision to not include merchandise from top French designers as the company's French locations had done.|$|E
5000|$|Quintus Considius, a {{moneylender}} at {{the time}} of the Catilinian conspiracy in 63 B.C., forwent the collection of debts and interest owed him in order to mitigate the alarm over the rapid depreciation of property, and <b>inability</b> of debtors <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> their creditors.

50|$|Renjen {{grew up in}} Rohtak, a city in Haryana's Rohtak district, in India, {{where his}} father had {{established}} an electrical switchgear factory. Around age seven, Renjen was sent to The Lawrence School, Sanawar, an autonomous public co-educational boarding school near Shimla, because his parents were seeking a better education for him than he was receiving in Rohtak. When Renjen was approximately fourteen years old, his father's business encountered financial difficulty, and the family's <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>paying</b> for boarding school forced Renjen to return to Rohtak and work at the family factory part time.|$|R

5|$|With {{the support}} of Adolf von Neuenahr and the Count Solms, Gebhard secured some of the {{northern}} and eastern portions of the Electorate, where he held a geographical advantage in his proximity to the rebellious Dutch provinces. In the south, however, Ferdinand's troops hunted the soldiers Gebhard had left in possession of such Oberstift villages as Ahrweiler and Linz; Gebhard's troops were forced out of their strongholds, hunted through the countryside, and eventually captured. By the fall of 1583, most of the Oberstift had fallen to Ferdinand's army and many of Gebhard's erstwhile supporters—including his own brother—had returned home. In some cases, they honored parole agreements made after their capture. A strong supporter, Johann Casimir of Simmern, brother of the powerful Louis VI, Elector Palatine, returned to the Palatine when his brother died. Other supporters were frustrated by Gebhard's chronic <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> his troops, or intimidated by threats of Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor. By late October 1583, most of the Oberstift had fallen, although he still held the Godesburg, located near the villages of Godesberg and Friesdorf, the formidable fortress at Bonn, and the fortified village of Poppelsdorf.|$|E
25|$|One {{could be}} demoted from Spartiate status {{for a number}} of reasons such as cowardice in battle or the <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for {{membership}} in the syssitia. <b>Inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> became such an increasingly severe problem because commercial activity had started to develop in Sparta. Some Spartiates had to sell the land from which they drew their income. As the constitution made no provisions for promotion to Spartiate caste, numbers gradually dwindled.|$|E

A new storage vessel, MT Bonsu, was purchased for storage of oil from the field. [...] It replaced the previously leased storage vessel MT African Wave, which had become dangerous to operate. [...] By other sources, the reason for termination of the leasing contract was the <b>inability</b> of SOPCL <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> its outstanding bills.|$|R
50|$|Both Guerrero Marthineitz's {{finances}} and health deteriorated quickly during 2009 and 2010, when a dearth in radio contracts and his <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> collect back <b>pay</b> resulted in his becoming homeless. Among those the noted emcee {{alleged to have}} owed him thousands of pesos were the government of San Luis Province and Mauro Viale, with whom Guerrero was reportedly engaged in a fistfight shortly after his May 2010 eviction.

50|$|Chinula {{established}} {{a number of}} churches and schools in the Mzimba district but was hampered {{by a lack of}} external funds and the <b>inability</b> of parents <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> school fees. The Church of Central Africa Presbyterian refused to recognise his or the other independent churches, and it was only in 1947 that the schools began to receive a small government grant. However, his church and schools continued to exist until 1967, when Chinula approached the Church of Central Africa Presbyterian, offering to rejoin it and disband his independent church.|$|R
25|$|Proof of <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> one debt may be {{accepted}} as proof that the debtor is unable to pay all his debts, but evidence that the debtor was unwilling or has refused to pay a particular debt {{is not enough to}} establish this act of insolvency.|$|E
25|$|In {{broad and}} {{everyday}} terms, {{a person is}} insolvent when {{he is unable to}} pay his debts. In legal terms, however, the test for insolvency {{is whether or not the}} debtor’s liabilities, fairly estimated, exceed his assets, fairly valued. <b>Inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> debts is, at most, merely evidence, and in itself, of insolvency.|$|E

50|$|Over the years, however, North Korea {{did much}} to {{discredit}} itself {{in the eyes of}} many potential supporters in Japan. Japanese who had accompanied their spouses to North Korea had endured severe hardships and were prevented from communicating with relatives and friends in Japan. Japan watched with disdain as North Korea gave safe haven to elements of the Japanese Red Army, which Japan designates as a terrorist group. North Korea's <b>inability</b> or refusal <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> its debts <b>to</b> Japanese traders also reinforced popular Japanese disdain for North Korea.|$|R
5000|$|Emma and Frank had a {{difficult}} marriage.
