The modifications began with introducing a chrome-lined barrel, an enhanced feeder, and an enhanced receiver. The weapon systems also received minor upgrades such as quick-detachable link covers, a larger breech assembly, a high efficiency muzzle brake, longer recoil, an integral round counter, an extended life firing pin and spring, and a triple-spring <b>drive</b> <b>clutch.</b> It was first {{put to use}} on the M2A3 Bradley, the fourth version of the M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Ultramatic did not switch automatically {{between high}} and low gearing ratios; the driver selected high or low ratio through the column shift lever. The intention was that in normal driving, the high (1:1) ratio would be selected at all times, and the two stage, dual turbine torque converter (actually a total of four turbines were employed) used to reduce gearing for starting off. At a speed of 15 - 56 mph (depending on rear axle ratio which affected the rate of governor pressure rise), governor pressure overcame the opposing throttle pressure, as determined by carburetor linkage position, causing the Direct Shift Valve to apply the direct <b>drive</b> <b>clutch.</b> This [...] "locked" [...] the torque converter, giving direct mechanical drive from the engine to the rear wheels, eliminating the power-robbing slippage of the torque converter at cruising speeds. On the highway, the Ultramatic delivered the same economy and power as a manual transmission. With the exception of Borg-Warner, major automotive manufacturers did not generally employ a locking torque converter until nearly thirty years later.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{the motor}} <b>driven,</b> <b>clutch</b> {{controlled}} panel switch selectors, crossbar switches using the link principle required incoming and outgoing markers {{to find an}} idle path {{and set up the}} switch train for each call. Earlier crossbar exchanges had used the crossbar switch according to the selector principle, with one input and typically 100 or 200 outputs, similar to a stepping switch. 1XB pioneered the link principle, with each switch able to handle as many phone calls as it had inputs or outputs, typically ten. This innovation diminished the cost of switches, at the expense of more complex controls. The complexity of the circuitry challenged the art of circuit drawings, leading to the development of detached contact drawings, which in turn led to the application of Boolean algebra and Karnaugh maps.|$|R

40|$|Due to {{rotating}} inertias {{within the}} engine and transmission, the response of a vehicle during large engine speed shifts may appear reluctant or even counteractive. To overcome this behaviour, a CVT drivetrain was augmented with a powersplitting planetary gear stage and steel flywheel in the so-called Zero Inertia (ZI) powertrain [1]. This transmission concept managed to combine two contradictive goals: · the driveability {{in terms of the}} pedal-to-wheel response is greatly improved; · and a large leap towards optimal fuel economy can be made. These goals were achieved by cruising the vehicle at extremely low engine speeds, enabled by the large ratiocoverage of the CVT. The flywheel acts as a 'peakshaver' during engine speed transients: it delivers power during (semi-) pedal kickdown and absorbs the engine's kinetic energy at pedal back-out. The current paper presents an improved concept with respect to the Zero Inertia drivetrain, which enables a reduced flywheel size while enhancing the pedal-towheel response even further. This concept is designated the Impulse Shift CVT (IS-CVT). The IS-CVT incorporates a slightly modified <b>drive</b> <b>clutch</b> and uses it to interrupt the power flow through the CVT during kickdown accelerations. Disengaging the <b>drive</b> <b>clutch</b> directs the entire engine power flow through the parallel (flywheel and planetary gear) branch, resulting in an immediate flywheel assist while the engine speeds up rapidly. When the engine has reached its desired speed, the <b>drive</b> <b>clutch</b> is re-engaged and the power flow through the CVT is reinstated. The presented IS-CVT concept enables much faster speed transients, independent of the CVT shift rate, resulting in a more effective use of the flywheel energy. Hence the flywheel can be reduced, and the ZI effect can be exploited to the fullest. Furthermore, the demands on the variator actuators can be lower.

40|$|Piecewise affine (PWA) systems {{provide good}} {{flexibility}} and traceability for modeling {{a variety of}} nonlinear systems. The stability of PWA systems is an important but challenging problem since {{the stability of the}} sub-systems does not directly imply the stability of the global system. Meanwhile, time delays and uncertainty exist in many practical systems in engineering and introduce various complex behaviors such as oscillation, instability and poor performance. To ensure the stability of the practical control systems developed via the PWA system framework, the stability of uncertain PWA time-delay systems is investigated. In addition, a quantitative description of asymptotic behavior for time-delay systems is also studied. First, the stability problem for uncertain piecewise affine time-delay systems is investigated. It is assumed that there exists a constant time delay in the system and the uncertainly is norm-bounded. Sufficient conditions for the stability of nominal systems and the stability of systems subject to uncertainty are derived using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional with a triple integration term. This approach handles switching based on the delayed states (in addition to the states) for a PWA time-delay system, considers structured as well as unstructured uncertainty, and reduces the conservativeness of previous approaches. Second, an application of the PWA system framework to the modeling and control of an automotive all wheel <b>drive</b> <b>clutch</b> system is presented. The open-loop system is modeled as a PWA system, followed by the design of a piecewise linear feedback controller. The stability of the closed-loop system is examined using the proposed stability method. Finally, a new Lambert W function based approach for estimation of the decay function for time-delay systems is presented. Using this solution form, a decay function estimate, which is less conservative than existing methods, is obtained...|$|E

With {{the help}} of the {{orthogonal}} experiment and the friction-wear mechanism by car as the research object of the <b>clutch</b> <b>driven</b> platen friction plate of Chongqing Changan CX 20 auto power take-off installation, the optimization of clutch friction materials is studied.

50|$|Chain brakes prevent {{movement}} of the saw's cutting chain by applying a steel brake band around the <b>driven</b> <b>clutch</b> drum. Clamping force for the brake band is provided by a powerful spring. The chain brake has two purposes. First, {{it can be used}} to secure the chain when changing position, moving between cuts or starting a cold saw, which requires a partly open throttle. This would otherwise lead to uncontrolled chain movement, a major hazard in older saws. Secondly, the chainbrake can activate under kickback conditions to prevent the operator from being struck by a running chain. Being struck by even a static chain may cause serious injury, but anything that can be done to mitigate the usually dreadful injuries caused by contact with a moving chain is of considerable benefit to operators. Kickback injuries usually occur to the head, face, neck and shoulders; when a running chain is involved, such injuries are usually very serious, often disfiguring and sometimes fatal.|$|R

40|$|The {{realistic}} {{investigation of}} the real behavior {{of the most important}} machine elements (gears, flexible <b>drives,</b> <b>clutches,</b> rolling and hydrodynamic bearings, etc) needs the application of several disciplines during the analysis process (contact mechanics, elasticity, fluid flow, heat exchange, noise propagation, for mechatronic elements the consideration of the effects of magnetic field or electricity could be also important). This fact gives the multidisciplinarity of the analysis process for machine elements. This multidisciplinary analysis process is used for checking several criteria or for the evaluation of the objective function(s) during the optimization of these elements. This way the optimization procedure of the most important machine elements develops into a multidisciplinary optimization process, which needs faster and more efficient tools of optimization and analysis, comparing to a conventional optimization process. In a previous paper (which could be treated as the first part of a series of papers concerning multidisciplinary optimization of machine elements), was shown the necessity and general basis of the multidisciplinary optimization of machine elements, giving many possible disciplines which could be integrated into a multidisciplinary optimization process. In this first paper only a very simple example was shown for the gears. In this paper a more general way is applied for the gears description and the optimization problem helical and profile modified gears is solved and presented. The results of this more general optimization procedure could be useful for practical gear designers in the improvement and development of gears. 2.
