40|$|OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: The primary {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to find whether the subscription rights trade at their fundamental values in Finnish rights offerings. The secondary objectives of the study are to find whether the stock price of the issuing firm correctly adjusts to the de-attachment of the rights on <b>ex-rights</b> day; if there is an announcement date effect on the date of announcement; and how large is the discount to theoretical <b>ex-rights</b> price used in pricing of the offerings. DATA: The data on rights offerings and historical share prices is sourced from Nasdaq OMXH Stock Exchange. The sample of offerings is downloaded with use of Bloomberg Professional. The sample consists of all executed rights offerings in OMX Helsinki and its predecessor Helsinki Stock Exchange during time period 2003 - 2013. The size of the sample is 45 rights offerings. Characteristics of the rights offerings are picked from respective stock exchange announcements. FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: The study finds that on average the subscription prices trade at 20, 4 percent discount to their fundamental values when measured by daily closing prices. Other findings include the stock prices to underreact to the de-attachment of the rights; the abnormal return on the announcement date to equal - 1, 3 percent; and the discount to theoretical <b>ex-rights</b> price to equal 36, 0 percent. The study does not argue that abnormal gains can be experienced in practice by participating in rights offerings but implies that it could be highly possible...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Due to the {{information}} asymmetry in Taiwan’s stock market, this study investigates the variation of stock return and risk with <b>ex-right</b> and ex-dividend date factors. By sampling on the companies listed in Taiwan that grant dividends every year between 2005 and 2014, Event Study methodology is conducted to explore on how <b>ex-right</b> and ex-dividend dates correlate to abnormal stock return and risk. Abnormal stock return with <b>ex-right</b> and ex-dividend date factors is not significant in 10 years sampling period, however, there are six (6) years of annual returns with significantly positive abnormal returns. Abnormal risk is not significantly correlated to <b>ex-right</b> and ex-dividend date factors, however, most of the results shows negative correlation, which indicates that ex-dividend and <b>ex-right</b> stocks has less risk than stock market index. Abnormal return is significantly negative correlated to abnormal risk during <b>ex-right</b> and ex-dividend period. The average cumulative abnormal return of high dividend stocks is higher than low dividend stocks during <b>ex-right</b> and ex-dividend periods.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the {{anomalies}} around the <b>ex-right</b> day of right issue. Evidence suggests that the equity price is not always adjusted according to the Theoretical <b>ex-right</b> price (TERP) around <b>ex-right</b> date and therefore creates large arbitrage opportunities. In an international perspective very {{few studies have been}} conducted on this area and to make attempt to provide explanations for market inefficiency of these markets. This study comprises an investigation of rights issues carried out on the Stockholm Stock Exchange during the period of 2009 and 2011, counting 45 rights offerings on the Large, Mid and Small Cap lists. The study is based on quantitative nature and is derived with an event study and a hypothesis testing. Collected data were analysed during an event window of nine days with <b>ex-right</b> date set as the event day and an estimation window of 100 days. Common Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) has been utilized to study the market efficiency around the <b>ex-right</b> date to explain the behaviour. Findings in this paper tell us that the excess return that has been observed can tactically be utilized by an observant investor to save money in a right issue that is commonly associated with diminishing returns for the investor. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} seasoned equity offerings (SEO) on stock return of listed companies in Ho Chi Minh City market using the method “event study” which has been basically formed by Campbell, Lo, and MacKinlay (1997). The sample includes 332 SEOs from 2007 to 2010. The main findings show evidence that the Ho Chi Minh City market was not efficient {{in terms of the}} semi-strong form because the price has increased significantly on the <b>ex-right</b> date, day 0. In an opposite way, the market also reacted significantly negatively from T- 4 to T- 2. There are some significant impacts of timing on issue methods – equity right issues were in priority for favorable time and issues as “dividend by stocks” were chosen during unfavorable time.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects on}} stock prices around the <b>Ex-rights</b> Dates (EDs) of rights offerings by firms listed on the Italian Stock Exchange. We focus on the period from January 2007 to April 2011, whereby several operations have been highly dilutive. Highly dilutive rights offerings show high subscription price discount of the new equities issued {{with respect to the}} prevailing stock market price. The anomalous behaviour of the prices attracted the attention of the Italian Authority for the Financial Markets (CONSOB). Our results demonstrate a significant average abnormal return of 5. 85 % on the <b>ex-rights</b> date, which is mostly driven by highly dilutive operations. In particular, we try to explain abnormal returns considering several variables related to the issue and to the issuer. We also control for differences across sectors. We find that the price-adjustment coefficient K explains most of the abnormal returns. We highlight that the stock price adjustment at the ED is so relevant in the case of highly dilutive operations to be similar to a stock splits and could have puzzled investors about the stock’s fair price. Furthermore, we examine the consequences on the option rights market, the trading volume and the Italian derivative market...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{ex-dividend}} day behavior of Japanese stock {{prices for the}} period 1983 - 87. We find that, contrary to previous findings, prices of ex-day stocks drop by nearly the full amount of the dividend. However, ex-day stocks shows an abnormal return. Also, for the many ex-dividend day stocks that also go <b>ex-rights</b> on the same ex-day, {{we find that the}} return is on average higher than that for stocks without rights issues. We thus conclude that the ex-day behavior of Japanese stocks are qualitatively similar to that of U. S. stocks. ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{evidence from}} UK rights {{issues on the}} discounts at which large blocks of new shares plus rights are sold. The shares are renounced by the shareholders entitled to them and placed with passive investors at substantial discounts of around 8 % to the expected <b>ex-rights</b> midpoint price of the existing shares. Tests indicate that the discounts arise because of uncertainty about issuer value and inelastic demand for the shares rather than because the issuing companies are overvalued. The finding that selling renounced shares is costly removes an apparent advantage of rights issues compared with open offers and private placings.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect on stock prices around the ex-dates of rights offerings by firms listed on the Italian Stock Exchange. We focus on the rights offerings {{that have taken place}} in the period between January 2009 and April 2011, whereby several of those have been highly dilutive, drawing the {{attention}} of the Italian Authority for the Financial Markets. The results demonstrate a significant abnormal stock return of 13. 81 percent on the ex-date of an offering for the whole sample, which is mostly driven by highly dilutive operations. In particular, we analyze the phenomenon by running multiple regressions of the cumulative abnormal return on the price-adjustment coefficient K at the <b>ex-right</b> date, the gross amount of funds raised at the offering and the market-to- book value. We find that the K-factor explains most of the anomaly. One of the main misleading peculiarities of high dilutive rights offerings is the high subscription price discount of the new equities issued with respect to the current stock market price. This implies that the ex-date stock price adjustment is so relevant to be similar to a stock splits. As a consequence, the price adjustment is able to puzzle investors about the stock fair price, as suggested also by the Italian Financial market Authority (CONSOB). Our results seem to confirm this hypothesis. Furthermore, we examine the consequences of the highly dilutive rights offers on the option right market {{as well as on the}} derivative markets being some of the stocks underlying assets of option contracts...|$|R
