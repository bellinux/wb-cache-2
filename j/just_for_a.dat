5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

25|$|The first Skull Session held at St. John Arena was in 1957. Prior to this, Skull Session {{was nothing}} more than a final run through of the music on the morning of the game. Originally, these were closed rehearsals that the band {{eventually}} opened up to friends and family members. Each week, more and more people showed up to hear the band rehearse that the director, Jack Evans, decided to move the rehearsal to St. John Arena across the street. Today, upwards of 14,000 people pack St. John Arena every home game to see the band and football team. Many of these people do not even have tickets to the game, but yet travel hours <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> chance to see and hear the band.|$|E
25|$|To {{realize a}} {{democracy}} {{in the workplace and}} the abolition of wealth and poverty, Unger argues for the need to relate the program of worker community and democracy with an enlargement of democracy at the national level—the goal cannot be only one of economic production and worker's rights, but must be accompanied by a national project at the structural level. He pushes this idea further by calling not <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> restructuring {{of the relationship between the}} firm and state based on private property, but that it also has to be replaced with a new set of rights encompassing access to jobs, markets, and capital. Only as private rights are phased out can rights of decentralized decision making and market exchange be extended to workers. This needs to be accompanied by limits on the size of enterprise and how profits are used to control others' labor.|$|E

25|$|However, it is {{fact that}} {{four out of}} five Germans {{complain}} about too much stress. One in six under 60 swallows at least once a week, a pill for the soul, whether it is against insomnia, depression or <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bit more drive in the stressful everyday life. The phases of burnout can be described, among other things, first by great ambition, then follows the suppression of failure, isolation and finally, the cynical attitude towards the employer or supervisor. Concerned persons have very often also anxiety disorders and depressions, which are serious mental diseases. Depressions are the predominant causes of the nearly 10,000 suicides that occur alone each year in Germany. The implications of such imbalances can be further measured in figures: In 1993, early retirement due to mental illness still made 15.4 percent of all cases. In 2008, there were already 35.6 percent. Even in the days of illness, the proportion of failures due to mental disorders increased. Statisticians calculated that 41 million absent days in 2008 went to the account of these crises, which led to 3.9 billion euros in lost production costs.|$|E

While there was a shortage of resources during the shooting of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S., the crew did not encounter a financial crisis during the filming of Lage Raho Munna Bhai, as the team managed to receive whatever was deemed necessary (including a Jimmy Jib, a specific kind of camera crane, <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> single crane shot).

500|$|The {{shooting}} script features {{a scene in}} Angela's car in which Ricky and Jane talk about death and beauty; the scene differed from earlier versions, which set it as a [...] "big scene on a freeway" [...] in which the three witness a car crash and see a dead body. The change was a practical decision, as the production was behind schedule and they needed to cut costs. The schedule called for two days to be spent filming the crash, but only half a day was available. Ball agreed, {{but only if the}} scene could retain a line of Ricky's where he reflects on having once seen a dead homeless woman: [...] "When you see something like that, it's like God is looking right at you, <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> second. And if you're careful, you can look right back." [...] Jane asks: [...] "And what do you see?" [...] Ricky: [...] "Beauty." [...] Ball said, [...] "They wanted to cut that scene. They said it's not important. I said, 'You're out of your fucking mind. It's {{one of the most important}} scenes in the movie!' If any one line is the heart and soul of this movie, that is the line." [...] Another scene was rewritten to accommodate the loss of the freeway sequence; set in a schoolyard, it presents a [...] "turning point" [...] for Jane in that she chooses to walk home with Ricky instead of going with Angela. By the end of filming, the script had been through 10 drafts.|$|E
