500|$|After the race, NASCAR {{announced}} it {{had found a}} problem with the lid on the oil reservoir encasement during a post-race inspection on Edwards' car, which was later taken to the NASCAR Research and Development Center in Concord, North Carolina, for further analysis. Three days after the race, Roush Fenway Racing was given penalties for [...] "actions detrimental to stock car racing", [...] "car, car parts, components and/or equipment used do not conform to NASCAR rules", and a device or <b>duct</b> <b>work</b> that permitted air to pass through the car from one area of the interior of the car to another, or to the outside of the car. The penalties included a $100,000 fine and a six-race suspension for Edwards' crew chief Bob Osborne, who was suspended from NASCAR until April 30, 2008, and placed on probation until December 31, 2008. Roush Fenway Racing chief engineer Chris Andrews took over Osborne's role at the next race weekend. Edwards and car owner Jack Roush incurred the loss of 100 driver and owner points. In the event that Edwards qualified for the Chase for the Sprint Cup, he would not receive ten bonus points awarded to him for winning the race which was used to determine the seeding order. Edwards was allowed to keep the victory; he moved from first to seventh in the Drivers' Championship. On March 12, Roush Fenway Racing {{announced it}} would not appeal the penalties.|$|E

The concentrations of toluene and xylene as the common solvents used in paint mixing factories were measured to evaluate the role of ventilation systems in controlling the organic solvents. Occupational exposure to toluene and xylene as the major pollutants was assessed with and without applying ventilation systems. For this purpose, samples were taken from breathing zone of exposed workers using personal samples. The samples were analyzed using Occupational Safety and Health Administration analytical method No. 12. The samples were quantified using gas chromatography.

The through-flow ducts consisted of an intake through the top surface of the model connected to an internal duct system with two exits near {{the back of the}} model on the top side. Computations were performed at Mach numbers M= 0. 50 and M= 0. 75 and the differences between the flow around the two geometries investigated. A multiblock grid approach allowed pointwise differences to be taken between the two flow fields around the two geometries, and for all grids on the wings to be pointwise identical. Significant differences in the flow due to the duct were observed, with the initial computations showing that the concept of the flow-through <b>duct</b> <b>works</b> and the amount of mass ingested causes significant changes in the flow field around the model. The duct exit flow had a significant effect on the flow, particularly at Mach number M= 0. 75, and this flow interaction may set a maximum testing Mach number for the model. Intake flow ratios (A_∞/A_c) up to 0. 60 were observed, which are on the low end of relevance to real configurations, but still high enough to be valuable...|$|R
40|$|Options for {{managing}} the common bile duct during laparoscopic cholecystectomy include routine peroperative cholangiography and selected preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The use of these methods was reviewed in 350 patients with symptomatic gall stones referred for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Unit A (n = 114) performed routine cystic duct cholangiography but undertook preoperative ERCP in patients at very high risk of duct stones only; unit B (n = 236) performed selected preoperative ERCP {{on the basis of}} known risk factors for duct stones. The detection rate for common bile duct stones was similar for units A and B (16 % v 20 %). In unit A, five of seven patients who had preoperative ERCP had duct stones. Operative cholangiography was technically successful in 90 % of patients and duct stones were confidently identified in 13, one of whom went on to immediate open duct exploration. Postoperative ERCP identified duct stones in only four patients, indicating spontaneous passage in eight. In unit B, preoperative ERCP was undertaken in 76 of 236 (32 %) patients and duct stones were identified in 47 (20 %).

Here we identify SOX 4 as a new regulator of biliary development. Inactivation of SOX 4, with inactivation of SOX 9, affects cholangiocyte differentiation, apico-basal polarity and bile duct formation. Both factors cooperate to control the expression of mediators of the TGFβ, Notch, and Hippo-Yap signaling pathways, which are required for normal development of the bile ducts. In addition, SOX 4 and SOX 9 control formation of primary cilia, which are known signaling regulators. The two factors also stimulate laminin α 5, which promotes bile duct maturation. We conclude that SOX 4 is a new regulator of liver development and that it exerts a pleiotropic control on bile duct development in cooperation with SOX 9.
