A major multi-breed study reported that Limousins converted feed into saleable meat more efficiently and significantly <b>faster</b> than popular British breeds, and marginally <b>faster</b> than other popular continental European cattle breeds. Conversely, the other cattle breeds produced proportionally more low-cost by-product and waste, which resulted in their live weight growth being <b>faster</b> than Limousins. Limousins are especially favoured for crossbreeding with cattle such as Angus, Hereford and Shorthorn because of their ability to contribute hybrid vigour, and improve the yield and feed conversion efficiency of these British breeds, which produce higher levels of fat and marbled meat.|$|E
