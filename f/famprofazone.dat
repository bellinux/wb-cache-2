5|$|Amphetamine is {{frequently}} measured in urine or blood {{as part of}} a drug test for sports, employment, poisoning diagnostics, and forensics. Techniques such as immunoassay, which is {{the most common form of}} amphetamine test, may cross-react with a number of sympathomimetic drugs. Chromatographic methods specific for amphetamine are employed to prevent false positive results. Chiral separation techniques may be employed to help distinguish the source of the drug, whether prescription amphetamine, prescription amphetamine prodrugs, (e.g., selegiline), over-the-counter drug products that contain levomethamphetamine, or illicitly obtained substituted amphetamines. Several prescription drugs produce amphetamine as a metabolite, including benzphetamine, clobenzorex, <b>famprofazone,</b> fenproporex, lisdexamfetamine, mesocarb, methamphetamine, prenylamine, and selegiline, among others. These compounds may produce positive results for amphetamine on drug tests. Amphetamine is generally only detectable by a standard drug test for approximately 24hours, although a high dose may be detectable for days.|$|E
50|$|<b>Famprofazone</b> (Gewodin, Gewolen) is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} agent (NSAID) of the pyrazolone series {{which is}} available over-the-counter in some countries such as Taiwan. It has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic effects. <b>Famprofazone</b> {{has been known to}} produce methamphetamine as an active metabolite, with 15-20% of an oral dose being converted to it. As a result, <b>famprofazone</b> has occasionally been implicated in causing positives on drug tests for amphetamines.|$|E
50|$|Pyrazolones are {{amongst the}} oldest {{synthetic}} pharmaceuticals, {{starting with the}} introduction of antipyrine (phenazone) in 1880's. The compounds generally act as analgesics and include dipyrone (Metamizole), aminopyrine, ampyrone, <b>famprofazone,</b> morazone, nifenazone, piperylon and propyphenazone. Of these dipyrone is perhaps the most widely used.|$|E

40|$|Urinary {{metabolites}} of <b>famprofazone</b> following {{oral administration}} in humans {{were identified by}} gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with electron impact-ionization and comparison with the spectra and retention times of authentic standards. The metabolites were determined following selective derivatization with N-methyl-bis-trifluoroacetamide (MBTFA) and N-methyI-N-trimethyl silyl trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA). <b>Famprofazone</b> was rapidly and extensively metabolized by N-dealkylation, ~-hydroxylation, and p-hydroxylation. The major metabolite, representing approximately 15 % of the dose, was methamphetamine. The other metabolites, 8 4000 which were present in minor amounts, were "~ amphetamine, norephedrine, norpseudo- ~ 2000 ephedrine, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, p-hydroxyamphetamine, p-hydroxy- o methamphetamine, and p-hydroxy-demethyl <b>famprofazone...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Famprofazone,</b> a major {{ingredient}} of Gewolen®, is an analgesic {{that has been}} demonstrated to be metabolized to methamphetamine (MA) and amphetamine (AM) following administration. Therefore, a <b>famprofazone</b> user may be interpreted as an illicit MA abuser in Taiwan because the user’s urine tested positive for MA. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate whether the concentration of MA metabolized from a single dose of Gewolen users would offend the official controlled substance regulation and be identified as MA-positive. Subjects (n = 6) received 25 mg of <b>famprofazone</b> and collected all urine specimens at certain timed intervals for 48 h after drug administration. The urine specimens were screened by immunoassay and then confirmed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The highest concentration of amphetamines by immunoassay was 1954 ng/mL, and 18. 8 % of the urine specimens ’ amphetamines concentrations exceeded 500 ng/mL. The MA and AM concentrations by GC–MS analysis of these urine specimens ranged from 901 to 2670 ng/mL and 208 to 711 ng/mL, respectively. These urine specimens were interpreted as MA-positive (≥ 500 ng/mL MA and ≥ 100 ng/mL AM), according to the official test methods of Taiwan. The MA positive results appeared within 2 – 34 h. It is therefore clearly possible to misinterpret the legitimate <b>famprofazone</b> user as an MA abuser in Taiwan...|$|E
