5|$|A 2005 {{animation}} film {{produced in}} Spain and titled Gisaku relates {{the adventures of}} a young Japanese samurai named Yohei who visited Spain in the 17th century, in a story loosely taking its inspiration from the travels of Hasekura. Yohei survived in hiding {{to the present day}} due to magical powers ("After centuries of lethargy, he awakes in a World he does not know"), and accomplishes many adventures in modern <b>Europe</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> superhero.|$|E
5|$|American {{automakers}} {{had first}} countered imports {{such as the}} Volkswagen Beetle with compact cars including the Ford Falcon, Chevrolet Corvair and Plymouth Valiant, although these cars featured six-cylinder engines and comprised a larger vehicle class. As the popularity of smaller Japanese imports from Toyota and Datsun increased throughout the 1960s, Ford North America responded by introducing the Ford Cortina from its European arm Ford of <b>Europe</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> captive import. American automakers would soon introduce their own subcompacts.|$|E
5|$|Both King George V of England and Cosmo Gordon Lang the Bishop of Canterbury took a {{personal}} interest in the Assyrian affair. British representatives at home demanded from Faysal that Sidqi and other culprits be tried and punished.

5|$|Goldfaden wandered <b>Europe</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{poet and}} journalist. His plays {{continued}} to be performed in Europe and America, but rarely, if ever, did anyone send him royalties. His health deteriorated – a 1903 letter refers to asthma and spitting up blood – and he {{was running out of}} money. In 1903, he wrote Jacob Dinesohn from Paris, authorizing him to sell his remaining possessions in Romania, clothes and all. This gave him the money to head once more to New York in 1904.|$|E
5|$|Hamburg {{had once}} been Germany's main seaport, the fourth largest in the world, but in 1943 {{virtually}} the entire city {{had been reduced to}} rubble by World War II bombing raids. By 1960, when they arrived, the Hamburg that had grown up from the ruins of WWII had established a reputation throughout <b>Europe</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> city of vice and criminal activity. In contrast to an economically depressed post-war Liverpool, Hamburg was a wealthy city.|$|E
5|$|The Marlboroughs {{also lost}} state funding for Blenheim Palace, and the {{building}} {{came to a halt}} {{for the first time since}} it was begun in 1705. Now in disgrace, they left England and travelled in <b>Europe.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result of his success in the War of the Spanish Succession, the Duke of Marlborough was a favourite among the German courts and with the Holy Roman Empire, and the family was received in those places with full honours.|$|E

5|$|The Second Crusade (1147–1149) was {{the second}} major crusade {{launched}} from <b>Europe</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Catholic ('Latin') holy war against Islam. The Second Crusade was started {{in response to the}} fall of the County of Edessa in 1144 to the forces of Zengi. The county had been founded during the First Crusade (1096–1099) by King Baldwin of Boulogne in 1098. While it was the first Crusader state to be founded, it was also the first to fall.|$|E
5|$|The {{prominence}} of Little Logic and Logic Return in the pedigrees of modern Australian Cattle Dogs was perpetuated by Wooleston Kennels. For some twenty years, Wooleston supplied foundation and supplementary breeding stock to breeders in Australia, North America and Continental <b>Europe.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, Wooleston Blue Jack is ancestral to most, if not all, Australian Cattle Dogs whelped since 1990 in any country.|$|E
5|$|Tolerance {{of other}} {{religions}} was over-supported by {{some in the}} English Party and others educated in the West {{as a symbol of}} Greece's progress as a liberal European state. In the end, power over the Church and education was ceded to the Russian Party, while the King maintained a veto over the decision of the Synod of Bishops. This was to keep balance and avoid discrediting Greece in the eyes of Western <b>Europe</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> backward, religiously intolerant society.|$|E

50|$|In 2004 the 322d Air Expeditionary Group was {{activated}} {{as part of}} the United States Air Forces in <b>Europe</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> Air Expeditionary unit.|$|R
5|$|After {{activation}} {{the division}} {{remained in the}} United States to complete its training. This training was completed by September 1944, but had to be extended by a further four months when the division provided replacements for the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions. The division also encountered delays in mounting large-scale training exercises {{due to a lack}} of transport aircraft in the United States. This shortage was caused by the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions taking priority over the 13th in terms of equipment due to the two divisions serving in combat in <b>Europe.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> consequence of these delays the division was not fully trained and combat-ready until January 1945, and was transferred to France and the European Theater of Operations in February.|$|E
5|$|All {{editions of}} the book were being printed in Europe until 1941, when the first {{publication}} of {{it was done in}} the United States by I. Bernard Cohen. The book is Franklin's only scientific work, and is recognized by historians Gary F. Kurutz and Dennis Smith as America's most important scientific book of the eighteenth century. The publication for his scientific observations on electricity made Franklin famous throughout <b>Europe</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> serious scientist. Eighteenth-century British polymath Joseph Priestley writes in his book The History and Present State of Electricity (1767) that nobody had written an in-depth study of electricity with the use of scientific experimentation like this of Franklin's that had been translated into most European languages in the eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|All {{significant}} Flemish {{political parties}} {{were reluctant to}} enter coalitions with the Vlaams Blok. Following a 1989 agreement, known as the cordon sanitaire, the party was effectively blocked from entering any level of government. The Court of Appeal in Ghent in April 2004 ruled {{that some of the}} party's organizations had breached the 1981 anti-racism law and that the party sanctioned discrimination. The ruling was made definite on 9 November 2004, and the party shortly after reorganised itself as the Vlaams Belang. By 2004, the party had arguably become the single most popular Flemish party in Belgium, supported by about one in four of the Flemish electorate, as well as being {{one of the most successful}} radical right-wing populist parties in <b>Europe</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole.|$|E

5|$|Chapter seven {{deals with}} conceptions of {{morality}} and ethics, arguing that whereas High Magic typically envisions a dualistic world view of good versus evil, Wicca adheres to a monistic worldview in which malevolence and benevolence are seen as intrinsic parts of the whole. Disagreeing with Luhrmann's view that morality's place in the occult is to hide the pseudo-scientific nature of magic, Greenwood discusses how magic and witchcraft developed in <b>Europe</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> part of moral discourse. She looks at the internal source of morality in High Magic, explaining concepts {{such as that of}} the Qliphoth, before examining the internal source of morality in Wicca and Feminist Witchcraft.|$|E
5|$|Colin Manley from The Remo Four {{was also}} given a booking {{to play in}} the club, which was the only venue that young amateur bands could play at the time. Other artists and groups like Cilla Black, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, The Searchers and Gerry & The Pacemakers later played in the club. The Black Jacks became the {{resident}} group at The Casbah, although The Quarrymen occasionally played there again and often visited. It was in The Casbah Club that Lennon and McCartney persuaded Stuart Sutcliffe to buy a Höfner 500/5 model—known in <b>Europe</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> President bass—with the money he had won in the John Moores art exhibition. Even though the membership list later spiralled to over a thousand, Mona closed the club on 24 June 1962, with The Beatles as the last group to perform.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Katia was {{a classic}} Cape Verde {{hurricane}} that had substantial impact across <b>Europe</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> post-tropical cyclone. The eleventh named storm, second hurricane, and second major hurricane of the active 2011 Atlantic hurricane season, Katia originated as a tropical depression from a tropical wave over the eastern Atlantic on August29. It intensified into a tropical storm the following day and further developed into a hurricane by September1, although unfavorable atmospheric conditions hindered strengthening thereafter. As the storm began to recurve over the western Atlantic, a more hospitable regime allowed Katia to become a major hurricane by September5 and peak as a Category4 hurricane with winds of 140mph (220km/h) that afternoon. Internal core processes, increased wind shear, an impinging cold front, and increasingly cool ocean temperatures all prompted the cyclone to weaken almost immediately after peak, and Katia ultimately transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September10.|$|E

5|$|In November 1943, the WSA {{allocated}} {{the ship}} to the U.S. Army, which converted her to a hospital ship. Though initially assigned the name Poppy, she was instead {{named in honor of}} First Lieutenant Blanche F. Sigman, a U.S. Army nurse killed in action in Italy. The hospital ship was initially based in Charleston, South Carolina, and made multiple voyages to ports in England, the Mediterranean, and France. After her homeport was changed to New York in December 1945, she made several more runs to <b>Europe</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> hospital ship, then converted to USAT Blanche F. Sigman in April 1946. As a transport, the ship made numerous trips bringing home nurses and military personnel prior to entering the National Defense Reserve Fleet in 1948. The ship was declared surplus by the Army in 1949, and sold for scrapping in 1974.|$|E
5|$|In September 1966, Olds {{was tapped}} to command an F-4C Phantom wing in Southeast Asia. En route he {{arranged}} with the 4453rd Combat Crew Training Wing, Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, (where Col. James was now Deputy Commander of Operations) {{to be checked}} out in the Phantom, completing the 14-step syllabus in just five days. His instructor was Major William L. Kirk, the 4453rd CCTW's Standardization and Evaluation officer, who {{had been one of}} Olds' pilots at RAF Bentwaters, and who later commanded the United States Air Forces <b>Europe</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> full general. Kirk accompanied Olds for practice firing of AIM-7 Sparrow and AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles on the Point Mugu missile range while Olds was en route to Travis Air Force Base for his charter flight overseas. Olds rewarded Kirk by granting him a transfer to his command in Thailand in March 1967.|$|E
5|$|Keable {{eventually}} achieved {{his wish}} {{of going to}} war in 1917, when a South African contingent was mustered for military service in France and Keable volunteered {{to go with them}} as chaplain. His experiences there were to form the basis for his first and most successful novel, Simon Called Peter. Appointed an army chaplain on 26 May 1917, Keable travelled to the Rouen sector with a Native Labour Contingent of 21,000 men. These men were paid £3 per month to unload supply ships and provide infrastructure support for military operations in <b>Europe.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> chaplain, with the rank of captain, Keable was expected to be at the disposal of the army at large, and ministered to those seeing active infantry service as well as to labourers. Padres were formally required to remain behind the lines, but it is apparent that Keable nonetheless saw something of the realities of the frontline.|$|E
