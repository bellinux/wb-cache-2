40|$|Companies face various risks when {{participating}} in international business. Even though exporting {{has been argued}} to represent low level of international commitment, exporters still face more risks in comparison to companies with purely domestic business activities. Among different risks lies credit risk which refers to possible non-payment or late payment of a customer. While exporters’ credit management is responsible for controlling credit risk, credit management in an international environment requires exporters to cope with incomplete information about customers’ creditworthiness and risks related to customers’ home countries. Even though there are various ways to conduct credit management, exporters may choose to acquire <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance to support their credit management practices. By acquiring <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance, exporters can hedge credit risk to credit insurers. This mitigates exporters’ {{exposure to credit risk}} if their customers fail to pay for purchased goods or services i. e. in case when credit risk realizes. This study explored exporters’ views on the value that <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance provides for credit management practices. In this study, value refers to the benefit or benefits that <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance provides. Theoretical background of the study includes literature relating to themes such as <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance, credit management and risks related to internationalization. The study applied a qualitative research approach through five expert interviews from two Finnish exporters and one private <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurer. Expert interviews were considered as the most suitable method to collect data in order to create in-depth understanding of an underresearched topic, compare interviewees’ perceptions with current literature as well as to reveal new perceptions towards the value that <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance provides for exporters and their credit management. Based on the existing literature and empirical research, it can be concluded that exporters see that <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance provides value mainly through risk transfer. Risk transfer may also enable exporters to gain additional benefits such as expanding export sales to destinations where they have not sold before. In addition, <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance can enable exporters to outsource a part of their credit management to credit insurers and to provide clear guidelines for exporters that have sufficient resources for independent credit management practices. On the contrary, it seems that exporters’ value perceptions towards <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance are dependent on the extent of insurance coverage that exporters have for their customer base. At the same time, exporters may easily question the premise of <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance if the level of customer non-payments is low...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{offers a}} complex {{analysis of the}} state supported <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> market in the Czech Republic. For the most {{part of the work}} the author deals with credit insurance market as it represents {{a key part of the}} system. Author analyses portfolio specifics of the local <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance agency and searches for the most effective risk mitigation techniques and procedures in order to maintain its long-term non-loss operations while keeping in mind its special supportive mission. Particular attention is given to the <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance agency's business policy that copes with problems of information asymmetry, moral hazard and adverse selection. Author points out the differences between state supported and commercial insurers, analyses European legislation preventing <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> agencies from competition with commercial insurers and outlines more effective endogenous and self-regulating system. Minority of the work deals with less important <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> financing agency that represents a dominant player at the <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> financing market. Author finds almost twenty reasons of its extraordinary position at the market that has no analogy within developed countries worldwide and outlines a system securing its complement role to the commercial banks. Finally the author provides the analysis of the whole state supported <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> system, highlights its main risks in conjunction with each other and concludes that combination of negative circumstances influencing several important features of the system could possibly lead to a long-term instability of the system...|$|R
