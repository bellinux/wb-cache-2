5|$|Since 1900, {{agriculture}} in the developed nations, {{and to a lesser}} extent in the developing world, has seen large rises in productivity as human labour has been replaced by mechanization, and assisted by synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and selective breeding. The Haber-Bosch process allowed the synthesis of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on an industrial scale, greatly increasing crop yields. Modern agriculture has raised social, political, and environmental issues including water pollution, biofuels, <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>organisms,</b> tariffs and farm subsidies. In response, organic farming developed in the twentieth century as an alternative to the use of synthetic pesticides.|$|E

5|$|Methods {{have been}} {{developed}} to purify DNA from organisms, such as phenol-chloroform extraction, and to manipulate it in the laboratory, such as restriction digests and the polymerase chain reaction. Modern biology and biochemistry make intensive use of these techniques in recombinant DNA technology. Recombinant DNA is a man-made DNA sequence that has been assembled from other DNA sequences. They can be transformed into organisms in the form of plasmids or in the appropriate format, by using a viral vector. The <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>organisms</b> produced can be used to produce products such as recombinant proteins, used in medical research, or be grown in agriculture.|$|E

25|$|Transgenic or <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>organisms,</b> be they bacteria, viruses or fungi, serve {{all kinds}} of {{research}} purposes. Transgenic plants, insects, fish and mammals have been bred. Transgenic plants such as corn and soybean have replaced wild strains in agriculture in some countries (e.g. the United States).

25|$|Despite {{technological}} advances, such as improved varieties, <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>organisms,</b> {{and irrigation}} systems, weather {{is still a}} key factor in agricultural productivity, as well as soil properties and natural communities. The effect of climate on agriculture is related to variabilities in local climates rather than in global climate patterns. The Earth's average surface temperature has increased by 1.5°F (0.83°C) since 1880. Consequently, agronomists consider any assessment has to be individually consider each local area.|$|E

We further found that a government certification did not increase the premium for GMO-segregation programs. Therefore, an additional mandatory regulation to reduce GMO contaminations would not be worthwhile because such a regulation would incur substantial enforcement costs. {{contingent valuation}} method, <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>organism</b> segregation, willingness-to-pay, Consumer/Household Economics, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, Food Security and Poverty, Marketing, D 12, M 31, Q 13, Q 18,...|$|R
50|$|There are strict {{regulations}} and protocols {{that go along}} with <b>genetically</b> <b>modifying</b> plants.

25|$|The first genetically {{modified}} plant was produced in 1983, using an antibiotic-resistant tobacco plant. Genetically modified microbial enzymes were the first application of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>organisms</b> in food production and were approved in 1988 by the US Food and Drug Administration. In the early 1990s, recombinant chymosin was approved for use in several countries. Cheese had typically been made using the enzyme complex rennet that had been extracted from cows' stomach lining. Scientists modified bacteria to produce chymosin, which was also able to clot milk, resulting in cheese curds.|$|E
25|$|Irrigation, crop rotation, and {{fertilizers}} {{were introduced}} {{soon after the}} Neolithic Revolution and developed much further in the past 200 years, starting with the British Agricultural Revolution. Since 1900, agriculture in the developed nations, {{and to a lesser}} extent in the developing world, has seen large rises in productivity as human labor has been replaced by mechanization, and assisted by synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and selective breeding. The Haber-Bosch method allowed the synthesis of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on an industrial scale, greatly increasing crop yields. Modern agriculture has raised political issues including water pollution, biofuels, <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>organisms,</b> tariffs and farm subsidies, leading to alternative approaches such as the organic movement and regenerative agriculture.|$|E
25|$|<b>Genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>organisms</b> (GMO) are organisms whose genetic {{material}} has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance {{are a few}} of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops, which have been put in place due to concerns over potential health issues, declining agricultural diversity and contamination of non-GMO crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.|$|E
50|$|A <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>organism</b> (GMO) and all {{subsequent}} identical clones {{resulting from a}} transformation process are called collectively a transformation event.
