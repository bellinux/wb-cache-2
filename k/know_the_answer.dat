25|$|The cue {{familiarity}} {{hypothesis was}} proposed by Reder and Ritter after completing {{a pair of}} experiments which indicated that individuals can evaluate their ability {{to answer a question}} before trying to answer it. This finding suggests that the question (cue) and not the actual memory (target) is crucial for making metamemory judgments. Consequently, this hypothesis implies that judgements regarding metamemory are based on an individual’s level of familiarity with the information provided in the cue. Therefore, an individual is more likely to judge that they <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> to a question if they are familiar with its topic or terms and more likely to judge that they do not <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> to a question which presents new or unfamiliar terms.|$|E

25|$|An individual's FOK {{judgments}} {{are not necessarily}} accurate, and attributes of all three metamemory hypotheses are apparent in {{the factors that influence}} FOK judgments and their accuracy. For example, a person is more likely to give a higher FOK rating, indicating that they do <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer,</b> when presented with questions they feel they should <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> to. This is in keeping with the cue familiarity hypothesis, as the familiarity of the question terms influences the individual's judgment. Partial retrieval also impacts FOK judgments, as proposed by the accessibility hypothesis. The accuracy of an FOK judgment is dependent upon the accuracy of the partial information which is retrieved. Consequently, accurate partial information leads to accurate FOK judgments, while inaccurate partial information leads to inaccurate FOK judgments. FOK {{judgments are}} also influenced by the number of memory traces linked to the cue. When a cue is linked to fewer memory traces, resulting in a low level of competition, a higher FOK rating is given, thus supporting the competition hypothesis.|$|E

Kštó (women only {{according}} to most sources) marks strong assertion. Yo (men) and ye (women) mark neutral commands, yetȟó (men) and nitȟó (women) mark familiar, and ye (both men and women) and na mark requests. He is used by both genders to mark direct questions, but men also use hųwó in more formal situations.

25|$|Feeling of Knowing (FOK) {{judgments}} {{refer to}} the predictions {{of being able to}} retrieve specific information an individual makes, regarding his or her knowledge for a specific subject, more specifically whether that knowledge exists within memory. These judgments are made either prior to the memory target being found or following a failed attempt to locate the target. Consequently, FOK judgments focus not on the actual answer to a question, but rather on whether an individual predicts that he or she does or does not <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> (high and low FOK ratings respectively). FOK judgments can also be made regarding the likelihood of remembering information later on and have proven to give fairly accurate indications of future memory. An example of FOK is if you can't remember the answer when someone asks you what city you're traveling to, but you feel that you would recognize the name if you saw it on a map of the country.|$|E

Ulam noted that von Neumann's way of thinking might not be visual, but more of an aural one.|$|E

About himself, Dawkins continues, [...] "I am agnostic {{only to the extent}} that I am agnostic about fairies at the bottom of the garden." [...] Dawkins also identifies two categories of agnostics; [...] "Temporary Agnostics in Practice" [...] (TAPs), and [...] "Permanent Agnostics in Principle" [...] (PAPs). He states that [...] "agnosticism about the existence of God belongs firmly in the temporary or TAP category. Either he exists or he doesn't.

2500|$|The {{definition}} of a standardized test has somewhat changed over time.

2500|$|When {{someone asks}} a person a {{question}} such as [...] "What is your name?", the person automatically knows the answer. However, when someone asks a person a question such as [...] "What {{was the fifth}} dinosaur ever discovered?", the person also automatically knows {{that he or she}} does not <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer.</b> [...] A person knowing that he or she does not know is another aspect of metamemory that enables people to respond quickly when asked a question that they do not <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> to. In other words, people are {{aware of the fact that}} they do not know certain information and do not have to go through the process of trying to find the answer within their memories, since they know the information in question will never be remembered. One theory as to why this knowledge of not knowing is so rapidly retrieved is consistent with the cue-familiarity hypothesis. The cue familiarity hypothesis states that metamemory judgments are made based on the familiarity of the information presented in the cue. The more familiar the information in the memory cue, the more likely a person will make the judgment that he or she knows that the target information is in memory. With regards to knowing that you don't know, if the memory cue information does not elicit any familiarity, then a person quickly judges that the information is not stored in memory.|$|E
