50|$|The British Bankers' Association (BBA) said on 25 September 2012 that {{it would}} {{transfer}} oversight of Libor to UK regulators, as predicted by bank analysts, proposed by Financial Services Authority managing director Martin Wheatley's independent review recommendations. Wheatley's review recommended that banks submitting rates to Libor must base them on actual <b>inter-bank</b> <b>deposit</b> market transactions and keep records of those transactions, that individual banks' LIBOR submissions be published after three months, and recommended criminal sanctions specifically for manipulation of benchmark interest rates. Financial institution customers may experience higher and more volatile borrowing and hedging costs after implementation of the recommended reforms. The UK government agreed to accept all of the Wheatley Review's recommendations and press for legislation implementing them.|$|E

The British Bankers' Association said on 25 September 2012 that it would transfer oversight of Libor to UK regulators, as proposed by Financial Services Authority managing director Martin Wheatley's independent review recommendations. Wheatley's review recommended that banks submitting rates to Libor must base them on actual <b>inter-bank</b> <b>deposit</b> market transactions and keep records of those transactions, that individual banks' Libor submissions be published after three months, and recommended criminal sanctions specifically for manipulation of benchmark interest rates.

50|$|On 28 September, Wheatley's {{independent}} review was published, recommending that an independent organisation with government and regulator representation, called the Tender Committee, manage {{the process of}} setting LIBOR under a new external oversight process for transparency and accountability. Banks that make submissions to LIBOR {{would be required to}} base them on actual <b>inter-bank</b> <b>deposit</b> market transactions and keep records of their transactions supporting those submissions. The review also recommended that individual banks' LIBOR submissions be published, but only after three months, to reduce the risk that they would be used as a measure of the submitting banks' creditworthiness. The review left open the possibility that regulators might compel additional banks to participate in submissions if an insufficient number do voluntarily. The review recommended criminal sanctions specifically for manipulation of benchmark interest rates such as the LIBOR, saying that existing criminal regulations for manipulation of financial instruments were inadequate. LIBOR rates may be higher and more volatile after implementation of these reforms, so financial institution customers may experience higher and more volatile borrowing and hedging costs. The UK government agreed to accept all of the Wheatley Review's recommendations and press for legislation implementing them.|$|E

40|$|The {{most widely}} used gauges of the money market {{liquidity}} conditions reflect both credit and liquidity risk. In this paper, we put forward two approaches to infer the liquidity component. A first type of approach gauges the credit risk of the banks participating in the Euribor panel by first inferring their default probability from prices on own Credit Default Swap (CDS) contracts. The liquidity component is estimated as a residual. In the second approach, the liquidity component is derived along a simultaneous model estimate, where variables include unsecured <b>inter-bank</b> <b>deposit</b> rates, zero coupon yields on financial bonds, and zero coupon yields on Treasury bonds. The results {{presented in this paper}} confirm that, throughout the market turmoil, the rise in the money market spreads owed to both liquidity and credit risks, where the relative weights of these two components changed over time with credit risk becoming more and more relevant, while initially the liquidity risk accounted for the lion's share. In responding to the crisis, the ECB (and other central banks) has utilized both traditional monetary policy instruments as well as innovative tools to provide liquidity. In the wake of these measures, the liquidity risk component fell dramatically. This result may witness in favour of the effectiveness of the policies undertaken by ECB...|$|E
