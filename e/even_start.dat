5|$|Prince Eugene was {{expected}} to be in position by 11:00, but due to the difficult terrain and enemy fire, progress was slow. Lord Cutts' column – who by 10:00 had expelled the enemy from two water mills upon the Nebel – had already deployed by the river against Blenheim, enduring over the next three hours severe fire from a heavy six-gun battery posted near the village. The rest of Marlborough's army, waiting in their ranks on the forward slope, were also forced to bear the cannonade from the French artillery, suffering 2,000 casualties before the attack could <b>even</b> <b>start.</b> Meanwhile, engineers repaired a stone bridge across the Nebel, and constructed five additional bridges or causeways across the marsh between Blenheim and Oberglauheim. Marlborough's anxiety was finally allayed when, just past noon, Colonel Cadogan reported that Eugene's Prussian and Danish infantry were in place – the order for the general advance was given. At 13:00, Cutts was ordered to attack the village of Blenheim whilst Prince Eugene was requested to assault Lutzingen on the Allied right flank.|$|E
5|$|The Russian army {{numbered}} nearly 98,000. It was {{commanded by}} generals Mikhail Krechetnikov and Mikhail Kakhovsky. The Russians {{also had an}} advantage in combat experience. The Russian plan called for Kakhovsky to advance through Ukraine, taking Kamieniec Podolski, Chełm and Lublin, and approach Polish capital of Warsaw from the south. Krechetnikov was to advance through Minsk, Wilno, Brześć Litewski and Białystok, and approach Warsaw from the north, where he was to link with Kakhovsky. Whereas the Russians had good intelligence network in Poland, and were mostly aware of Polish army distribution and strength; the Poles had much less intelligence, receiving contradictory and often erroneous reports, and unsure whether the war would <b>even</b> <b>start</b> {{up to the point}} the Russian troops crossed the border.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season generally begins in August and September {{with the onset}} of the humid season, but the climate during a particular year may change the timing of breeding. On Cima, W. R. P. Bourne observed females remaining in flocks while males began to take up locations on rocky slopes from which they could sing. The {{breeding season}} is typically long enough that some pairs may be fledging young before others <b>even</b> <b>start</b> to build a nest; the greatest number of pairs breed when rains come, in October to November. Unmated males attract females by calling out beside a prospective nest site. When approached by a female, the displaying male will increase the intensity of his calls and hop around her while crouching with chestnut rump- and shoulder-feathers exposed. The male begins building the nest, but once a pair is formed both birds of the pair participate in the nest's construction and remain close together. Copulation occurs after the nest has been constructed, while the female is dominant in the pair for a time. The male invites the female to copulate by giving the crouching courtship display, and after ignoring and pecking at him initially, the female solicits copulation by crouching herself. When four vagrants were in the Netherlands in May 2013, a male was seen mounting a second male, apparently after the second crouched submissively to resolve a fight between them. This is the only recorded case of homosexual behaviour in sparrows.|$|E

25|$|After the Byzantine {{plan to use}} Aaron {{to cause}} {{instability}} in Bulgaria failed, they tried to encourage the rightful heirs to the throne, Boris II and Roman, to oppose Samuel.

Boris and Roman were sent back in 977 but while they were passing through a forest near the border, Boris was killed by Bulgarian guards who were misled by his Byzantine clothing.

25|$|England had a {{good time}} between the Fourth and Fifth Tests. Mike Denness {{returned}} to form with 157 not in their innings victory over Tasmania and 99 in a 187 run win over New South Wales. Dennis Amiss made 52 and 124 in the Sydney game and Chris Old took 7/59. Denness therefore returned to the team as England captain, replacing the injured vice-captain John Edrich who was still recovering from his damaged ribs, which had in fact been broken, not just bruised as previously thought. Australia dropped the batsman Ross Edwards in favour of the local leg-spinner Terry Jenner. There was a storm the night before the first day, which ripped the covers off the field and flooded the ground. The nightwatchman had not called the curator, so the damage could not be repaired in time for the first day's play, which had to be abandoned. The ex-Australian umpire Col Egar thought that play might not <b>even</b> <b>start</b> on the second day. What made it more distressing was that a record crowd appeared despite the series having already been won, but had to be turned away. Jim Laker and Ken Barrington were part of the crowd, escorting travel groups of British cricket fans. As it was there was a steady wind which helped dry out the ground overnight, except at the River Torrens end, but the famously long boundary was pulled in with ropes marking a now egg shaped Adelaide Oval. Denness called heads {{and for the first time}} England won the toss. With the pitch still worse for wear he chose to field, the third time the winning captain had taken this unusual course in the series.|$|E
25|$|The new McLaren-Honda package {{started out}} to be {{unreliable}} and problematic after a 29 January launch. In the three pre-season tests Button, teammate Alonso and reserve driver Kevin Magnussen only had a single day over one hundred laps, which was completed by Button. Arriving in Australia Button qualified 17th (out of 18) and finished 11th and last in the detuned McLaren to ensure the team and new power unit supplier, Honda Racing F1 would compile decent mileage because of energy recovery issues. This continued into Malaysia where Button had to retire from the race. In China, Button collided with Lotus racer Pastor Maldonado in the latter stages of the Grand Prix. Button received a five-second time penalty dropping him one spot to 14th and two penalty points to his super licence which was previously clean for which the points will last twelve months. Button described the crash as 'just a misjudgement'. Button had a horrible weekend in Sakhir where {{he had to stop}} on track three times, once in FP1, another time in FP2 and again in Q1 where he was unable to set a time and had to line up 20th and last on the grid. After an energy recovery issue Button could not <b>even</b> <b>start</b> the race. In Monaco, he scored his first points of the season, finishing in 8th place. At his home Grand Prix in Great Britain, Button retired on the first lap after contact with his teammate Alonso. At the Hungarian Grand Prix, Button finished in ninth place. Button also finished ninth at Sochi and in the next Grand Prix at Austin he finished an incredible sixth place out of 12 finishing drivers, with his teammate Alonso finishing eleventh.|$|E

500|$|Devil's Due {{released}} three-issue mini-series Halloween: The First Death of Laurie Strode in late 2008. Written by Hutchinson with artwork from Jeff Zornow, {{the story}} bridges {{the gap between}} Halloween II and Halloween H20 by focusing on Laurie Strode {{in the aftermath of}} the 1978 murders. Hutchinson explains that Laurie is [...] "trying to get better and trying to repair, but where do you <b>even</b> <b>start</b> after going through such horror? How do you even try to resume normality when you don't know what that is anymore?" [...] Although Michael appears in the series, it is not clear whether he is real or if the traumatised Laurie is seeing things. Hutchinson is not a fan of the revelation that Laurie and Michael are siblings and took steps to address that problem in the story. He wanted to avoid the [...] "bloodline plot of the middle sequels", which he felt demystified the character of the Shape, and approach the story so that [...] "it becomes almost incidental that she's his sister". Hutchinson believed that Laurie Strode's evolution into Keri Tate was fertile ground for a storyline; he says, [...] "it's not the faking of the death that's interesting at all, but it’s the fall that leads to that happening. The faked death is just simple mechanics and can be covered in a sentence, but the state of mind and events leading to that are full of rich character and dramatic potential." ...|$|E
