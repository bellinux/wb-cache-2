5|$|Further {{changes were}} made to the {{techniques}} used. Each morning, 36 chickens were roasted for their juices rather than the meat being used on the menu. Each chicken was pressed in a colander to ensure that all the liquid was expressed. These juices were mixed with those from the roasting trays after they had been deglazed with Madeira wine and then added a small amount of veal stock. The actual roasted chickens ended up being too dry to serve following the process, and so were used <b>for</b> <b>staff</b> lunches or were discarded. These 36 chickens produced enough juice for the sauces to accompany 30 chicken dishes. Similar processes were conducted with lamb shoulders, where they were pressed only for the creation of sauces.|$|E
5|$|In late 2007 the {{restaurant}} {{moved to a}} modern building custom-built for {{the restaurant}} about 100 meters from the prior location, with the original location still being used <b>for</b> <b>staff</b> meals. The new layout features wooden floors, with simply dressed tables. On each table sits three stones to signify the three Roca brothers, while the tableware is Rosenthal china. The enlarged kitchen in the new location includes space for thirty chefs to work and also features Joan Roca's open plan office, {{so that he can}} {{keep an eye on the}} chefs even while he is doing more administrative tasks. At least one of the three brothers is present for every service. There is a capacity for 45 diners.|$|E
5|$|On 22 October 1940, {{during the}} Blitz bombing {{campaign}} against Britain, {{it was decided}} to increase the protection of the Cabinet War Rooms by the installation of a massive layer of concrete known as 'the Slab'. Up to 5 feet (1.5 metres) thick, the Slab was progressively extended and by spring 1941 the increased protection had enabled the Cabinet War Rooms to expand to three times their original size. While the usage of many of the War Rooms' individual rooms changed {{over the course of the}} war, the facility included dormitories <b>for</b> <b>staff,</b> private bedrooms for military officers and senior ministers, and rooms for typists or telephone switchboard operators.|$|E

5|$|The Army's {{training}} program attracted criticism, {{both at the}} time and subsequently. In 1937, Brigadier General George C. Marshall felt that in merging instruction on command and staff duties, the Command and General Staff School had neglected the former in favor of the latter, with officers being prepared <b>for</b> <b>staff</b> duties in peacetime rather than the chaos of command in wartime. Brigadier General Lesley J. McNair conducted a survey of graduates in 1939 that found that most felt that there was too much emphasis on obsolete skills like equitation. For this reason, the staff rides were disliked. While most considered the map exercises the most valuable part of the curriculum, some noted that students spent time discovering for themselves things that they could have been told.|$|E
5|$|The Chief of Engineers, Major General Eugene Reybold, {{selected}} Colonel James C. Marshall to {{head the}} Army's {{part of the project}} in June 1942. Marshall created a liaison office in Washington, D.C., but established his temporary headquarters on the 18th floor of 270 Broadway in New York, where he could draw on administrative support from the Corps of Engineers' North Atlantic Division. It was close to the Manhattan office of Stone & Webster, the principal project contractor, and to Columbia University. He had permission to draw on his former command, the Syracuse District, <b>for</b> <b>staff,</b> and he started with Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Nichols, who became his deputy.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} of the Clinton Laboratories passed from Monsanto to the University of Chicago in May 1947, and then to Union Carbide in December 1947. The Atomic Energy Commission's influential General Advisory Committee, chaired by J. Robert Oppenheimer, recommended that all work on reactors be concentrated at the Argonne National Laboratory, the successor to the Metallurgical Laboratory, near Chicago. There was also competition <b>for</b> <b>staff</b> and resources from the newly established Brookhaven National Laboratory near New York. Morale was low, {{and no one could}} be found to take on the job of Director of Research at the laboratory, renamed the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in January 1948. At least six people turned down the job before Union Carbide's acting Director, Nelson (Bunny) Rucker, asked Weinberg to become Director of Research in March 1948.|$|E

5|$|The prison officer's {{role in the}} 20th century did {{not change}} much, with the job still entailing a boredom-inducing daily routine focused on security. Officer {{training}} became a priority under Campbell's administration, from the late 1960s. Training courses were set up <b>for</b> <b>staff</b> inductions and promotions, and seminars were started for senior officers. The most significant change in this period, however, was that prison officers achieved representation through the Western Australian Prison Officers' Union. The strength of the union {{was based on the}} ability to almost cripple the prison system through strike action, first taken in 1975.|$|E
5|$|We give an acre for a cow or sheep willingly, {{while we}} shut our {{children}} and our chickens up in too limited spaces, and they suffer in consequence. Schools of the future must be provided with estates where the children will be surrounded with many natural and beautiful things. Part of the practical work was growing food for the school. In 1944 the daily two-course dinner, <b>for</b> <b>staff</b> and over 90 students, was mostly the school's farm's produce. After the war, from c.1948–55, the school received child migrants from Belgium, Greece and the United Kingdom. The school was known as Hagley State School until 1936, Hagley Farm School until 1976 and Hagley Farm Primary School since.|$|E
5|$|Dannatt left Northern Ireland {{ahead of}} the rest of the {{battalion}} and was posted to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in Surrey, then under the command of Major (later General Sir) Rupert Smith, and expected this to be his last posting in the light of his stroke. He applied for a variety of jobs outside the Army but, after Smith's encouragement, sat the entrance exams <b>for</b> <b>Staff</b> College, Camberley, also in Surrey. He passed the entrance exams and turned down two civilian job offers to accept his place. Before Camberley, in late 1980, Dannatt was posted to Catterick Garrison, North Yorkshire, as a company commander. In early 1981, his company took over the running of HM Prison Frankland during a month-long strike by prison officers. Shortly after the end of the strike, he was posted to Cyprus with the United Nations peacekeeping force before returning to Surrey for the start of the one-year Command and Staff Course at Camberley. After completing the course, he was promoted to major on 30 September 1982, and appointed chief of staff to 20th Armoured Brigade, based in West Germany.|$|E

5|$|McNicoll {{was briefly}} reposted to HMS Victory on 1 September 1943, before being {{transferred}} <b>for</b> <b>staff</b> duties with the Admiralty in London the following month. He completed a year-long attachment with the Admiralty, and {{was involved in}} the planning for the Normandy landings. On 15 February 1944, he attended an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace, where he was formally presented his George Medal by King George VI. McNicoll returned to Australia and was attached to the staff of HMAS Cerberus in October 1944; he spent the remainder of the war in this post. Up to this period, McNicoll had completed all but five of his years of military service attached to the Royal Navy. McNicoll's three brothers also served in the Second World War: Ronald Ramsay, who ultimately retired with the rank of major general and served in the Korean War, as a colonel with the Royal Australian Engineers; Frederick Oscar Ramsay as a lieutenant in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN); and David Ramsay—who would become an accomplished journalist—as a lieutenant in the 7th Division up to 1944, before spending the remainder of the conflict as a war correspondent for Consolidated Press, in which capacity he covered the Normandy landings.|$|E
5|$|On 2 June, and in {{response}} to a question from Fianna Fáil's James Browne about government spending on mental health, McEntee told the Dáil the government was committed to an annual increase in funding; Browne had noted that in 2014, €20 million had been allocated to mental health services rather than the promised €35 million, but McEntee said that €35 million had been ringfenced for 2016 and 2017. Along with Minister for Health Simon Harris, McEntee argued for the restoration of €12 million originally ringfenced for mental health spending that had been diverted to other areas. On 8 June, and as part of a €480m bailout package for health, the government announced that the mental health funding would be restored. Welcoming the decision, McEntee said the money would be used <b>for</b> <b>staff</b> recruitment and to improve services for homeless people, as well as developing perinatal mental health services.|$|E
5|$|School House, 70The Close, was {{formerly}} {{part of the}} Carnary college but now contains classrooms and school offices. While much of the building dates to around 1830, extensive 14th and 15th century features remain such as the stone entrance archway. The building, which is Grade I listed, adjoins the Erpingham Gate and is three storeys high and has eight bays. School End House, 69The Close, is a 17th-century timber-framed house built against {{the east end of}} the school chapel. Formerly a home, the Grade I listed building is now the senior common room <b>for</b> <b>staff</b> and a school office. The entrance is pilastered and is surrounded by lion-mask roundels. The Music School, 71The Close, was built in 1626–28 as a home for the prebendaries of the cathedral, funded by the chapter. Typical of the period, the Grade II* listed building was constructed from flint-rubble, brick, and reused materials from monastic buildings in the Close. It replaced an earlier house and incorporates the remains of a medieval free-standing bell tower originating in the 12th or 13th century, rebuilt around 1300 and largely demolished by 1580.|$|E

5|$|The Mounted Infantry Depot was a post {{where young}} {{officers}} could be stationed, forming a ready reserve of young, educated officers available as volunteers <b>for</b> <b>staff</b> or command positions in African colonial campaigns. It was whilst {{attached to this}} post that Alderson saw service in the First Boer War in 1881 in the Transvaal. The following year, Alderson served in the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War, fighting at the battles of Kassassin and Tel-el-Kebir. Two years later, Alderson {{was attached to the}} Mounted Camel Regiment during the failed expedition to relieve Khartoum and rescue General Gordon. During this campaign, Alderson was presented with the Bronze Medal of the Royal Humane Society after diving into the Nile to rescue a drowning soldier. For his service in these campaigns, Alderson was promoted to Captain and was stationed at Aldershot with the European Mounted Infantry Depot. The same year he married the daughter of the vicar of Syresham, Northamptonshire, a Miss Alice Mary Sergeant.|$|E
5|$|The {{facility}} features architecture {{intended to}} evoke {{a sense of}} calm.

There are also separate hallways <b>for</b> <b>staff</b> and visitors {{in order to make the}} interior appear less crowded. The hospital also features a substantial amount of parking and a shuttle service to the entrance. Miami Valley Hospital South was constructed with future expansion in mind. Two of the five floors in the patient wing are empty and can be filled adding 24 beds each. A third hallway can be added to the wing which will add 60 beds, and the maternity ward can also be expanded with a second floor to add 12 beds, which means the facility could be expanded to 180 beds.|$|E
