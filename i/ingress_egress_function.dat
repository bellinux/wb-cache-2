50|$|Targeted LDP {{sessions}} are different because during the discovery phase hellos are unicast to the LDP peer {{rather than using}} multicast. A consequence {{of this is that}} tLDP can be set up between non-directly connected peers whereas non-targeted LDP peers must be on the same subnet. tLDP may still be used between connected peers if desired. On a router running TiMOS when an SDP (Service Distribution Path) is configured, automatic <b>ingress</b> and <b>egress</b> labeling (targeted LDP) is enabled by default and <b>ingress</b> and <b>egress</b> “service” labels are signaled over a TLDP connection.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} traffic allocation in multipath IP networks. We postulate that the desired equilibrium distribution of network bandwidth is one where every flow acquires a TCP-fair share along each of the routes connecting its <b>ingress</b> and <b>egress.</b> This characterization calls for connection striping at the ingress to balance the load among the available routes. Still, the desired equilibrium is not reachable when flows are allowed to compete freely for bandwidth, in which case, striping is known to reduce the throughput of TCP below the fair share on the least-congested path. Using the fairness properties of TCP congestion control, we prove that under connectionload balancing and <b>ingress</b> [...] <b>egress</b> traffic isolation, multipath networks tend to reach the desired equilibrium at steady-state [...] -despite the interaction among flows within traffic aggregates. The practical value of this result stems from the accuracy with which <b>ingress</b> [...] <b>egress</b> bandwidth allocations can be approximated using token buckets as rate limiters at the ingress routers {{and the availability of}} an efficient method for the accurate estimation of the TCP-fair shares...|$|R

40|$|Electric utility {{companies}} across the US {{have been using}} aerial bucket trucks for line work and troubleshooting for decades. The use of these trucks {{eliminates the need for}} workers to climb utility poles in order to repair or maintain lines. Poor <b>ingress</b> and <b>egress</b> design can lead to acute injuries (slips and falls) as well as cumulative injury (musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs)). Utility companies want to know the best combination of steps and handlebars for aerial bucket <b>ingress</b> and <b>egress</b> that would minimize the risk of injury. American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard – ANSI/SIA A 92. 2 - 2009, sets design requirements for aerial buckets that provide regulations for factors of safety. Based on the testing procedures for electrical ratings (which can exceed 100 kV for electric line work), an access door to an aerial bucket is not feasible at this time for most electric utilities. The objective of this research was to test whether bucket design features for a one-person bucket offer ergonomic advantages to workers for <b>ingress</b> and <b>egress.</b> Muscular activity of the four most affected muscle groups in the upper and lower extremities were analyzed using EMG sensors throughout <b>ingress</b> and <b>egress.</b> A series of conditions that integrated variations of the design features (inside step, outside steps and a horizontal handle bar) were tested. Based on results, the following design recommendations would decrease the risk of a slip or fall and the biomechanical loading to the upper extremities when entering and exiting the bucket: 1. Always have an inside step – on either the front side (side with the outer steps) or in an adjacent corner location. 2. Have one outside step, with a horizontal handlebar on the boom side of bucket for support. 3. If a bucket has two outer steps, then a horizontal handlebar must be mounted on the boom side of bucket...|$|R
