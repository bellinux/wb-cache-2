5|$|After the LCL lost {{government}} in 1970, primarily {{owing to the}} <b>electoral</b> <b>reform,</b> Hall managed to be re-elected as leader. He convinced {{a majority of the}} party's membership that reform was needed, and sought to remove the influence that the party's representatives in the Legislative Council held. When the Dunstan government again introduced a bill to introduce universal suffrage to the council, Hall gained the support of 7 out of 20 members in the Assembly, but only 2 of 16 LCL members in the Legislative Council supported the bill. Internally, there was much opposition to any <b>electoral</b> <b>reform</b> when the matter was debated at party conferences.|$|E
5|$|Paraná {{succeeded in}} passing <b>electoral</b> <b>reform,</b> which {{was called the}} Lei dos Círculos (Law of the Circles). As predicted, and feared, it gave greater powers to the {{president}} (prime minister) of the Council of Ministers to meddle in elections. Unexpectedly, Paraná fell ill and died on 3 September 1856. Caxias replaced him, but was reluctant to face the legislature, elected under the <b>electoral</b> <b>reform,</b> that was slated to convene the next year. He resigned, {{along with the other}} cabinet ministers, on 4 May 1857. The Law of the Circles and the controversy surrounding it split the Conservative Party: one faction was the saquarema ultraconservative (or tradionalist) wing, then called the vermelhos (reds) or puritanos (puritans), led by Eusébio de Queirós, Uruguai and Joaquim Rodrigues Torres, Viscount of Itaboraí. The second bloc comprised the conservador moderado (moderate Conservative) wing, composed mostly of younger politicians who owed their positions to <b>electoral</b> <b>reform.</b>|$|E
40|$|Good {{governance}} is {{a precursor}} for effective <b>electoral</b> <b>reforms</b> in any democratic country. While {{the practice of}} democracy is often expected to yield the much needed effective governance, credibility of electoral systems have militated against translating democracy into good governance. The subject of <b>electoral</b> <b>reforms</b> has received sporadic attention, with need for more attention especially in Kenya. With the analysis of primary data obtained from purposively sampled respondents (lawyers, journalists and trainers) with extensive knowledge of recent <b>electoral</b> <b>reforms</b> in the Kenyan democracy, the paper examined the effectiveness of <b>electoral</b> <b>reforms</b> in promoting good governance in Kenya. It identified the availability and extent to which <b>electoral</b> <b>reforms</b> promote peaceful coexistence and good governance. The paper concluded that for <b>electoral</b> <b>reforms</b> to achieve an the expected outcome of good governance there is need for full implementation of <b>electoral</b> <b>reforms,</b> strengthening of the country’s democratic institutions and intensifying civic education on electoral amongst the citizenry as a priority for good governance in Kenya...|$|R

5|$|The UFA government, {{which had}} campaigned on <b>electoral</b> <b>reform,</b> {{introduced}} AV {{in the rural}} constituencies in 1926, with the unique feature of only two rounds: rather than redistribute votes from each last-place candidate in several counts, only the top two candidates from the first count would advance to the second count. Edmonton and Calgary were also converted to STV districts, where a complicated system of vote transfers resulted in roughly proportional results.|$|E
5|$|Behind {{the votes}} in {{parliament}} was a personal antagonism between Hall and Ren DeGaris, {{the leader of the}} LCL in the Legislative Council. DeGaris, who was elected to the council in 1962, was a staunch defender of its franchise and electoral boundaries. The two were the de facto leaders of the party's two factions; Hall represented the urban-based progressives, and DeGaris the rural-based conservatives. The conflict between the two extended beyond politics and on to a personal level, contributing to the polarisation of views within the LCL and making it difficult for an internal compromise to be reached on the issue of <b>electoral</b> <b>reform.</b>|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} common {{features}} found within peace agreements are provisions that call for post-civil war elections. Unfortunately, recent research on post-civil war stability has consistently demonstrated that the initial elections held after civil wars significantly increases the risk for renewed fighting. While this research does highlight a danger posed by post-war elections, it focuses only on one element associated with post-civil war democracy. I argue that by implementing <b>electoral</b> <b>reforms</b> that are called for in peace agreements, post-war countries reduce the risk of renewed civil war. Implementing these peace agreement provisions increases the durability of post-war peace in two ways. First, by implementing costly <b>electoral</b> <b>reforms</b> called for in the peace agreement, the government signals a credible commitment to the peace process which reduces security dilemmas faced by opposition groups. Second, <b>electoral</b> <b>reforms</b> generate new avenues for political participation for disaffected citizens, which reduces the ability of hardliners to mobilize future armed opposition. I examine how implementing post-war <b>electoral</b> <b>reforms</b> impact the risk of renewed conflict from 1989 through 2010. Using duration models, I demonstrate that implementing these <b>electoral</b> <b>reforms</b> substantially reduces the risk of renewed conflict...|$|R

Pearson was in favour of the disestablishment of the Church of England and opposed capital punishment. Politically, he supported universal suffrage and <b>electoral</b> <b>reform</b> to balance the sizes of parliamentary constituencies. He unsuccessfully attempted to break the local monopolies developed by the gas companies, calling for the distribution pipework to be owned collectively by the consumers.|$|E
5|$|In 1853 Paraná {{was again}} {{appointed}} {{president of the}} Council of Ministers, {{at the head of}} a highly successful cabinet, and became the most powerful politician in the country. The <b>electoral</b> <b>reform</b> he ushered in was credited with undermining national political processes and causing severe harm to the system of parliamentary government. For his role in pushing through restructuring, Paraná met with fierce opposition from the majority of his colleagues, leading to a virtual split in the Conservative Party over his policies. On 3 September 1856, while still in office and at the height of his political career, he died unexpectedly of an unknown febrile condition. He is widely regarded by historians as one of the most influential statesmen of his time.|$|E
5|$|Most {{voters in}} Brazil had a low income. For example, in the Minas Gerais town of Formiga in 1876, the poor {{constituted}} 70% of the electorate. In Irajá {{in the province}} of Rio de Janeiro, the poor were 87% of the electorate. Former slaves could not vote, but their children and grandchildren could, as could the illiterate (which few countries allowed). In 1872, 10.8% of the Brazilian population voted (13% of the non-slave population). By comparison, electoral participation in the UK in 1870 was 7% of the total population; in Italy it was 2%; in Portugal 9%; and in the Netherlands 2.5%. In 1832, the year of the British <b>electoral</b> <b>reform,</b> 3% of the British voted. Further reforms in 1867 and 1884 expanded electoral participation in the UK to 15%.|$|E

5|$|Political {{tensions}} {{amongst the}} working classes in Glamorgan had grown during the 1820s: although wages were impressive by contemporary standards during good years, they deteriorated quickly during depressions, plunging many into destitution; sanitation and health {{standards in the}} fast-growing industrial communities were appalling, child mortality rates were extremely high. 1831 saw a severe economic depression, with wages falling quickly and food prices rising, and complaints against the local debt courts and their bailiffs were numerous. Nationally, the <b>electoral</b> <b>reform</b> movement was making considerable protests and protests against the Corn Laws—which kept the prices of food high—were growing. In South Wales, several of the major ironmasters were associated with these movements, promoting reform under the Whig administration voted into power between April and June 1831.|$|E
5|$|The {{proportional}} representation {{system for the}} House of Councillors, introduced in 1982, {{was the first major}} <b>electoral</b> <b>reform</b> under the post-war constitution. Instead of choosing national constituency candidates as individuals, as had previously been the case, voters cast ballots for parties. Individual councillors, listed officially by the parties before the election, are {{selected on the basis of}} the parties' proportions of the total national constituency vote. The system was introduced to reduce the excessive money spent by candidates for the national constituencies. Critics charged, however, that this new system benefited the two largest parties, the LDP and the Japan Socialist Party (now Social Democratic Party), which in fact had sponsored the reform.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{instigator}} for {{the creation}} of the LM in 1972 had been based around the lack of <b>electoral</b> <b>reform.</b> The electoral system had been expected to continue to return rural LCL members in the Legislative Council, yet at the 1973 state election Labor had, through the mass registration of new voters for the council vote, managed to gain two seats, giving a 14–6 split in the council. As half the council was elected at each election, Labor only had to retain their vote to gain an additional two seats at the 1975 state election, and a minor rise in it would see additional council seats fall to them. It was increasingly plausible that Labor would be able to gain a majority in the Legislative Council within a decade and then carry through their goal of abolishing it, and push through any electoral legislation it so wished.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} give the LM {{national}} exposure, Hall decided to stand for the Australian Senate at the 1974 federal election. Another objective was to allow Millhouse and Cameron to become more prominent at state level and dispel the established perception of the LM as a Hall party. The move was a risk as failure would have left the LM's main drawcard {{out of the spotlight}} entirely until a state election which was not due for another two years, but Hall said the party had no future unless it could gain national stature. Another possible problem was that the media could have lost interest in the LM at a state level regardless of whether Hall won a senate position. The 1975 federal election followed a double dissolution (meaning that all Senate seats, rather than half, were up for election and thus a candidate needed only roughly half of the normal percentage to gain election; Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was hoping to attain a majority in the Senate), and all ten South Australian Senate seats were contested. The battle between the LCL and the LM was not seen as {{a large part of the}} national campaign, as South Australia was only a small part of the nation and most of the marginal seats that would determine the outcome were in other states. The LM gained 9.9 per cent of the vote in the Senate and Hall was elected in his own right, without the assistance of preferences. In the House of Representatives, the LM gained 8.4 per cent of the vote across the 12 South Australian seats, ranging from a high of 18 per cent in metropolitan Boothby to 1.6 per cent in rural Angas. Fortunately for Hall and the LM, the senate election resulted in Labor and the Liberal-Country Party coalition holding 29 seats each, and Hall was one of two crossbenchers who held the balance of power. The media made much of Hall's position as a powerbroker at federal level, and the Liberals responded to him in a hostile manner; for his part, Hall continued to persistently attack them as outmoded and lambasted them over the matter of <b>electoral</b> <b>reform.</b>|$|E

40|$|Evaluating the {{fairness}} of <b>electoral</b> <b>reforms</b> is a critical requirement for electoral accountability in any democracy. There is, however, no research measuring the expected seat benefit for incumbent reformers in newly democratized countries. Much of this delay {{is due to the}} technical difficulties of generalizing previous seat-vote models to multiparty races, a problem that has limited both subna-tional and cross-national comparisons of electoral regime change. Using a multilevel Bayesian model we solve this analytical problem and produce comparable estimates of partisan bias and majoritarian bias across the Argentine provinces. Our model estimates the effect of <b>reforms</b> across many <b>electoral</b> regimes and can be applied to comparative analyses of <b>electoral</b> <b>reforms</b> within and across countries. In the particular case of Argentina, we show large seat premiums for incumbent parties initiating elec-toral reforms. In the last 20 years Latin America has undergone remarkable political changes not just to consolidate the rule of law but to change it as well. <b>Electoral</b> <b>reforms</b> have been implemented in most countries of the region, affecting how citizens vote and how politicians get elected. Major <b>electoral</b> <b>reforms</b> led to the elimina-tion of the Electoral College in Argentina; the introduction of mixed-member electoral rules in Bolivia, Mexico, and Venezuela; the use of preferential vote in Brazil and Colombia; and the elimination of apparentment rules in Uruguay, to mention some of the most commonly cited examples. As was also the case in Eastern Europe (Benoit 2004; Elster, Offe, and Preuss 1998), the last 20 years constitute the most dynamic period of electoral regime change in Latin America since the introduction of proportional representation (PR) in the early twentieth century. Within each country, subnational <b>electoral</b> <b>reforms</b> were also frequent and had far reaching distributive effects. The seat benefits obtained by incumbent reformers, however, remain mostly an exercise in political speculation.
