5|$|Birmingham is chiefly {{a product}} of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries; its growth began during the Industrial Revolution. Consequently, {{relatively}} few buildings survive from <b>its</b> <b>earlier</b> history and those that do are protected. There are 1,946 listed buildings in Birmingham and thirteen scheduled ancient monuments. Birmingham City Council also operate a locally listing scheme for buildings that do not fully meet the criteria for statutorily listed status.|$|E

5|$|Like Icelandic and Faroese, the {{development}} of English on the British Isles isolated it from the continental Germanic languages and influences, and has since undergone substantial evolution. English is thus not mutually intelligible with any continental Germanic language, differing in vocabulary, syntax, and phonology, although some, such as Dutch or Frisian, do show strong affinities with English, especially with <b>its</b> <b>earlier</b> stages.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the Central Troy Historic District is, {{particularly}} in <b>its</b> <b>earlier</b> years, the history of Troy itself.

5|$|After the US {{entered the}} war and the British Army {{recovered}} from <b>its</b> <b>earlier</b> defeats, it defeated the Germans and Italians at the Second Battle of El Alamein in North Africa in 1942â€“1943 and helped drive them from Africa. It then fought through Italy and, with the help of American, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, Indian and Free French forces, took part in the D-Day invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944; nearly half the Allied soldiers were British. In the Far East, the British Army rallied against the Japanese in the Burma Campaign and regained the British Far Eastern colonial possessions.|$|E
5|$|As for <b>its</b> <b>earlier</b> productions, Century 21 {{launched}} {{a number of}} merchandising campaigns based on Joe 90, which included toy cars and comic strips featuring the continuing adventures of Joe McClaine. The series was syndicated in the United States in 1969, re-broadcast in the UK during the 1990s and released on DVD in most regions in the 2000s. The idea of a live-action film adaptation of Joe 90 has been considered more than once since the 1960s, but without further development.|$|E
5|$|Banksia sessilis has a {{somewhat}} complicated taxonomic history. It was collected from King George Sound in 1801 and described by Robert Brown in 1810 as Dryandra floribunda, a name {{by which it}} was known for many years. However, Joseph Knight had published the name Josephia sessilis in 1809, which had precedence due to <b>its</b> <b>earlier</b> date, and the specific name was formalised in 1924. Four varieties are recognised. It is a prickly plant with little apparent horticultural potential, {{and none of the}} varieties are commonly seen in cultivation. A profuse producer of nectar, B.sessilis is valuable to the beekeeping industry.|$|E

5|$|Before {{passage of}} the Civil Marriage Protection Act, the state {{recognized}} same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions following the 2010 release of a legal opinion from Attorney General Doug Gansler in his nine-month analysis of comity laws. In 2012, the Maryland Court of Appeals maintained Gansler's analysis and issued a unanimous decision in Port v. Cowan finding that a same-sex marriage performed out-of-state must be considered equal and valid under state law, despite <b>its</b> <b>earlier</b> decision in Conaway v. Deane (2007) in which the court upheld the statutory ban on same-sex marriage as constitutional.|$|E
5|$|By 1867, church {{authorities}} {{deemed the}} problems with the tower as severe enough to warrant a major reconstruction of the church. George Gilbert Scott, who had recently designed the monumental London buildings of the Foreign Office and St.Pancras Station, was chosen to lead the project. Scott was a leading advocate of the Gothic Revival and saw the renovation as a chance to return St.Mary's to a state nearer to <b>its</b> <b>earlier</b> Gothic design.|$|E
