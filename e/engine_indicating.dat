50|$|An {{electronic}} {{flight instrument}} system (EFIS) is a flight deck instrument display system that displays flight data electronically rather than electromechanically. An EFIS normally {{consists of a}} primary flight display (PFD), multi-function display (MFD), and an <b>engine</b> <b>indicating</b> and crew alerting system (EICAS) display. Early EFIS models used cathode ray tube (CRT) displays, but liquid crystal displays (LCD) are now more common.

Now, however, few flight deck instruments cannot be replaced by an electronic display.|$|E
