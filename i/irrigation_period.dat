50|$|In 1925 the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District (MRGCD) was formed. It built a levee {{to reduce}} the impact of Rio Grande floods, drained the swampy land and {{improved}} the acequias. During and after World War II, the city of Albuquerque has grown steadily. The MSGCD still maintains a large network of canals and irrigation systems that stretches from 30 mi north of Albuquerque through the city down to the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge. As of 2012 the MRGCD was responsible for an area of 278000 acre, of which 128787 acre could be irrigated and 70000 acre were in fact being irrigated by 11,000 farmers. The MRGCD was maintaining four diversion dams and reservoirs, 834 mi of canals and ditches and 404 mi of riverside drains. With growing urbanization, {{the role of the}} MRGCD has gradually shifted from supporting agriculture to preserving the riverside ecology and helping to recharge the Albuquerque aquifer.The Rio Grande in the Albuquerque basin had a diverse population of mainly endemic fish up to the late nineteenth century. By the early 1960s many of the native species were no longer present {{in the northern part of}} the basin.Speckled chub and Rio Grande bluntnose shiner, two cyprinids, were last found in 1964. By the mid-1990s 45 species of fish were reported in the basin, of which only 17 were native. More than 40% of the native species of this section of the river have been eliminated. The main threats to the fish are diversion and pumping of water. River volumes peak between March and June due to the spring runoff, but demand for irrigation peaks between July and October. During the <b>irrigation</b> <b>period,</b> the river downstream from the Isleta diversion dam may largely dry up unless irrigation water is returned to the river or a summer storm provides a brief influx of water.

A pot experiment {{was conducted to}} assess the impact of using municipal wastewater for irrigating Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi seedlings by evaluating its growth, chemical constituents and histological structure responses as affected by <b>irrigation</b> rates, <b>periods</b> and treated wastewater types. The study was carried out during seasons of 2009 / 2010 and 2010 / 2011 at the nursery of the Ornamental Horticulture Department, Faculty of Agriculture, Cairo University, Egypt. The seedlings were irrigated with potable tap water (control) and three treated wastewater types (primary, aeration and secondary) at two rates (75 and 100 % field capacity (F.

Growth traits (seedling height and leaves and main roots number) and chemical constituents (total nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), cupper (Cu), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe) and total carbohydrates) were measured. Histological structure (lamina and midrib thicknesses, length and width of midrib main vascular bundles and number of oil glands) was also conducted. The irrigation with wastewater performed best under all <b>irrigation</b> rates and <b>periods</b> as compared to the control. Increasing irrigation rates from 75 to 100 % F.

40|$|Cyclic {{irrigation}} {{is considered}} an effective water management practice for reducing pollutant loads from a paddy-field district. The objective {{of this study was}} to clarify the effects of cyclic irrigation on mass balance in paddy plots. At the study site, cyclic irrigation with a high cyclic irrigation ratio (% reused water in irrigation water) was conducted from late April to late June. We found a complementary relationship between the volume of irrigation water and rainfall, which together totaled about 1400 – 1600 mm during the <b>irrigation</b> <b>period</b> each year. We concluded that a cyclic irrigation system that enables the paddy-field district to use a high cyclic irrigation ratio may lead to more efficient use of rainfall for crop irrigation. Nitrogen concentrations in both irrigation water and ponded water tended to be higher during the cyclic <b>irrigation</b> <b>period</b> than during the lake water <b>irrigation</b> <b>period.</b> Nitrogen input from irrigated water accounted for about 8 – 16 % of the total input of nitrogen.

This study aimed to determine water use by upland rice plants during <b>periods</b> of <b>irrigation</b> withholding and its relationship with grain yield in order to increase the efficiency of this phenotyping. Two experiments were carried out in a randomized block design in which six water treatments (<b>irrigation</b> withholding for <b>periods</b> of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 days) were compared, with four replicates. In the first experiment, treatments were applied at the R 3 stage (panicle exsertion) and, in the second, at the R 5 stage (beginning of grain filling). The amount of water evapotranspired was determined by the difference between the soil water storage at the beginning {{and at the end of}} <b>irrigation</b> withholding <b>periods,</b> from the surface to 80 -cm depth.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to analyze the ways of water {{distribution}} in a rice growing area during the pre-saturation and normal <b>irrigation</b> supply <b>periods</b> and to assess water use (WU). The analyses were conducted using field data collected at the Besut rice irrigation scheme located {{in the state of}} Terengganu, Malaysia. The scheme comprises two sub-schemes, which are further subdivided into compartments and blocks. Based on field water requirements during the pre-saturation and normal <b>irrigation</b> supply <b>periods</b> and available flows at the intake structures, canal simulation was performed using the CanalMan Model. Results have shown that pre-saturation should not be done continuously unless flow rates are 9. 00 m 3 /sec and 3. 00 m 3 /sec for the Besut and Angga Barrages, respectively. If the respective flow rates fall below these values, then pre-saturation should be done in two phases. However, when the flow rate is between 5. 00 and 5. 50 m 3 /sec at Besut Barrage, pre-saturation is recommended to be carried out over three phases. During normal <b>irrigation</b> supply <b>period,</b> flow rates of 5. 00 m 3 /sec and 1. 50 m 3 /sec for the Besut and Angga Barrages respectively, are to be maintained for the whole irrigation scheme.

The average water productivity was 0. 31 kg/m 3 and 0. 25 kg/m 3 during the main season and off-season, respectively. Two WU indices, WPI and AI, ranked the performance of the blocks and identified those having problems in water allocation and utilization.

The experiment was carried out during the successive season of 2010 / 2011. The results indicate that fresh weight of stem and foliage are increased without any significant for the seedlings irrigated by PTW compared to WW. However, fresh weight of roots and oven-dry weight of foliage are significantly increased. No significant differences are observed for the specific gravity and fiber length of wood produced from seedlings irrigated by either WW or PTW. The results indicated that irrigation with PTW influenced the chemical composition of T. aphylla wood.

40|$|Assessing {{factors that}} {{influence}} groundwater levels such as land use and pumping strategy, is essential to adequately manage groundwater resources. A transient numerical model for groundwater flow with infiltration was developed for the Tedori River alluvial fan (140 km 2), Japan. The main water input into the groundwater body {{in this area is}} irrigation water, which is significantly influenced by land use, namely paddy and upland fields. The proposed model consists of two models, a one-dimensional (1 -D) unsaturated-zone water flow model (HYDRUS- 1 D) for estimating groundwater recharge and a 3 -D groundwater flow model (MODFLOW). Numerical simulation of groundwater flow from October 1975 to November 2009 was performed to validate the model. Simulation revealed seasonal groundwater level fluctuations, affected by paddy irrigation management. However, computational accuracy was limited by the spatiotemporal data resolution of the groundwater use. Both annual groundwater levels and recharge during the <b>irrigation</b> <b>periods</b> from 1975 to 2009 showed long-term decreasing trends.

40|$|The {{research}} {{performed in}} the framework of the completion of the Ph. D. dissertation, is focused on the optimal reservoir operation for irrigation purposes during the <b>irrigation</b> <b>period.</b> The time interval is the 10 days. The remainder period of year determines the reservoir storage {{in the beginning of the}} <b>irrigation</b> <b>period,</b> while so much the reservoir storage in the beginning of the <b>irrigation</b> <b>period</b> and inflow during the <b>irrigation</b> <b>period</b> are regulated and used for the irrigation. The objective function maximizes the total farm income, which is based on actual yield, area, production cost and crop prices. The constraints include the state equation of reservoir, reservoir storage, irrigation requirements of a crop and reservoir release, yield and cropped area. The decision variables are the optimal allocation of cultivation areas for any number of irrigated crops and the optimal irrigation schedule, which specifies the amount of irrigation to be applied to each crop during its growing season. The actual yield is calculated with the production function given by Jensen and the maximum evapotranspiration coincides with crop evapotranspiration, which is the product of a crop factor and the reference evapotranspiration which is computed from the FAO Penman-Monteith equation. The determination of the actual evapotranspiration is becomes with the soil water balance and soil water depletion function. The optimization of the nonlinear discrete-time dynamic model is performed in two stages. During the first stage the simulated annealing (SA) global optimization stochastic search algorithm is used and in a second stage it is refined the solution reached by the SA, using a stochastic gradient descent algorithm. SA has been proved under suitable conditions (Gauss distribution to generate test points, Boltzman distribution for acceptance of these and logarithmic reduction of temperature) to converge with probability one to the global optimal solution, in the limiting case of infinite iterations. The optimisation model is applied on historical and synthetically data from a planned reservoir on the Havrias River in Northern Greece. Synthetically data are referred to rainfall, inflow and reference evapotranspiration are calculated with frequency analysis Summary 321 in a synthetic series duration of 50 years (economic life of work), which resulted from 100 synthetic series that were produced for every of this variables. The optimization computes the optimal distribution of areas and crops, the water release to satisfy irrigation requirements and the total profit. The procedure is relatively easy to apply and can be used as a decision support tool for cropping patterns of an irrigated area and irrigation scheduling. ...|$|E

The aim of this in vitro study was to verify the antibacterial potential of RCI with low surface tension in root canals infected with Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis). Methods and Materials: Thirty-five extracted human maxillary anterior teeth were prepared and inoculated with E. faecalis for 60 days. After root canal preparation, the teeth were randomly divided to one positive and one negative control groups and 5 experimental groups: Hypoclean/Tetraclean NA, Hypoclean, Tetraclean, NaOCl/Tetraclean and NaOCl. Bacterial growth was observed by turbidity of culture medium and then measured using a UV spectrophotometer. Data were analyzed in three time intervals (pre-instrumentation and, 20 min and 72 h after canal preparation) using the ANOVA and post hoc Tukey’s tests. The level of significance was set at 0. 05. Results: The results indicated the presence of E. faecalis in all post-irrigation samples irrespective of the RCI. However, the optical densities in both post- <b>irrigation</b> <b>periods</b> showed bacterial reduction and significant differences between groups. Conclusion: RCI with low surface tension showed antibacterial potential in E. faecalis infected roots...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} interest towards climate change, {{water and energy}} saving, and soil protection has led the research community to consider non-conventional water as a sustainable source for irrigation of energy crops. Vegetation filter systems are considered a reliable technique for sustainable biomass cultivation, enabling the use of reclaimed wastewater as water and nutrients sources during <b>irrigation</b> <b>periods.</b> In this study, a geographic information system (GIS) -based spatial model was developed to identify areas potentially suitable for creating vegetation filter systems with poplars to size the plants of energy production. An economic assessment allowed us to identify the cost-effectiveness areas for biomass production that can be fertigated by reclaimed wastewater. Considering the Basilicata region as the test region, a surface area of 258, 512 ha was investigated, identifying 73, 331 ha of SRF soils sited downstream of 45 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). However, considering only areas that have positive net present value and are economically attractive, results indicate 1606 ha of SRF falling within the areas of influence of 39 WWTPs. The {{results show that the}} sector of dedicated crops, adjacent and linked with WWTPs, expresses a total capacity of 50. 56 MW for thermal, 8. 25 MW for electricity, and 31 MW for cogeneration (25. 07 MWt and 5. 94 MWe) plants...|$|R

In this research area, Kanzaki district in　Iwate Prefecture, a farm land consolidation is planned in fiscal 2007, therefore the consideration plan to habitation {{of the fish}} is requested on this research area. Then, we were investigated to clarify habitat factor of {{the fish in the}} paddy field area in this research. As a result, early flow velocity into the canal and the head between the paddy field and the ditch was a negative factor {{for the life of the}} fish in　<b>irrigation</b> <b>period.</b> On the other hand, a high water temperature into the canal was a positive factor for them in non-irrigation period...|$|E

As possible factors involved in the excess moisture injury, soil properties, topographic condition, water table and precipitation were investigated. The results obtained are summarized as follows; 1. Soil of the root zone in the planting pit is of good quality, but that located outside the root zone is of poor quality. 2. The water table is elevated during on <b>irrigation</b> <b>period</b> or on rainy days. 3. The most important factor causing the death of street trees is concluded to be the abnormal precipitation...|$|E

The following parameters were monitored: Pomological parameters, free fatty acids, peroxide value, total phenols, bitterness intensity, oxidative stability, fatty acid composition and aromatic profiles. After the <b>irrigation</b> <b>period,</b> the virgin olive oil exhibited some modifications, mainly in terms of fatty acids composition and volatiles. The amount {{of oil in the}} fruit seems not to be influenced by the irrigation management. To obtain the best quality and to use the minimum amount of water, the best irrigation level was 75 % ET...|$|E
40|$|Vegetative roofs are {{nowadays}} {{a widespread}} technology due to many benefits provided both at building and city scale. Namely, they reduce buildings’ energy consumption and improve cities’ urban environment by heat island mitigation. They may also increase rooftop comfort {{conditions for the}} users during summer days. Therefore, {{the assessment of the}} hygrothermal vegetative roof behavior is very important for a correct quantification of its impacts. Irrigated vegetative roofs are necessary for certain climates and plant species during summer; however, data concerning the ideal water requirements are still scarce. This study assesses the vegetative roof performance for a temperate climate concerning the effect on the outdoor environment, based on surface temperatures and heat fluxes, with and without the contribution of irrigation. The experimental vegetative roof setup located in Porto provides data for the hygrothermal analysis. The monitored parameters- temperature profiles, heat fluxes and water content profiles, together with outdoor conditions-allow a detailed analysis of the real behavior in summer with varying irrigation. The air temperature, solar radiation, and irrigation amounts, together with irrigation schedules and antecedent <b>irrigation</b> <b>periods,</b> were found to be determinant on the heat fluxes variation and on surface temperature reduction. The available hygrothermal simulation tools for vegetative roof, key for studying the roof response, were briefly assessed. The major limitations are related to the water balance and the properties of the vegetation and substrate...|$|R

40|$|A {{physiological}} disorder in greenhouse hydroponic sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L.), where {{the base of}} the plant’s stem becomes swollen below the cotyledon level and wounds develop at {{the base of the}} stem’s epidermis has been named “Elephant’s Foot”. The disorder might predispose the plant to a localized rot and result in sudden plant wilt. Factors that might cause the disorder are not known; however salt accumulation {{at the base of the}} stem could be a possible cause of the epidermal wounds. The effects of soilless media (perlite, coconut coir, pine bark, and peat-perlite-vermiculate mix), transplant depth, and amount of nutrient solution applied per day were studied to evaluate the development of “Elephant’s Foot ” on a summer-fall sweet pepper (cv. Kelvin) greenhouse crop in Gainesville, FL, USA. Seedlings in 370 cm 3 cell polyethylene containers were transplanted (29 June, 1999) into 11. 4 -liter pots at three transplant depths: a) at half of the cell height, discarding only the bottom of the container, b) at the cotyledons level, and c) at the 2 nd stem node. Plants were irrigated with the same frequency but with different <b>irrigation</b> <b>periods</b> in order to give per day volumes of solution of 2, 2. 5, 3, 3. 5, and 4 liters per plant.
