5|$|In June 2012, Bosh {{withdrew his}} name from {{consideration}} for the 2012 Olympics in London to recover from a lower abdominal strain that <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of some playoff games.|$|E
5|$|Raonic opened 2014 by {{reaching}} {{the third round}} of the Australian Open, losing to Grigor Dimitrov. He sustained an ankle injury that <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of action for six weeks.|$|E
5|$|Bozon {{recorded}} 36 {{goals and}} 91 points in 69 games during the 2012–13 season, finishing {{second on the}} Blazers in scoring and tied for eighth overall in the WHL. In the playoffs Bozon scored six points in eight games; a fractured wrist <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> {{of most of the}} Blazers' playoff games.|$|E
50|$|Avery's {{associate}} Martin Dawson at The Rockefeller Hospital confirmed each of Griffith's reported findings. Even before Griffith's publication, Fred Neufeld had confirmed them as well, and {{was merely}} awaiting publication of Griffith's findings before publishing his confirmation. Over the following years, Avery's illness, Graves' disease, <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> much <b>out</b> of his laboratory as other researchers in it experimented to determine, largely by process of elimination, which constituent was the transforming factor.|$|R
50|$|In the 2013-14 season, Pander {{appeared}} in the opening game of the season, in a 2-0 win over Wolfsburg. However, he suffered a ligament injury and after an operation, {{it was announced that}} he was out for months. It was not until on 7 December 2013 {{when he returned to the}} first team in a 4-2 loss against Stuttgart. His return was short-lived as he twisted his knee. This injury <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> again <b>out</b> for months. He made his return against Hamburg on 12 April 2014. Although his season was disrupted by injuries, Pander went on to make ten appearances in all competitions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{but it was}} a mistake. He {{knew that}} Lindau was {{inflexible}} about his principles, as he calls them, and that one of his first principles is to denounce the rich in season and out of season. I don't remember just what he said last night; and I really thought I'd <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> from breaking <b>out</b> in the most offensive way. But your father seems very much incensed." ...|$|R
5|$|Fowler's {{performance}} in the 1997–98 football season was marred by an anterior cruciate (knee) ligament injury that <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of action for half the season and caused him to miss the 1998 World Cup. During this period of injury, fellow Liverpool striker, Michael Owen rose to prominence, making his debut in 1997. Owen established himself in the Liverpool team in Fowler's absence.|$|E
5|$|He {{was little}} known {{personally}} to the English public. His absence at sea, and on travels and duty with his regiment, <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> {{of the general}} eye... at times, there was a sallowness of hue, which much increased the grave aspect... {{not only in the}} metropolis, but throughout the country, somehow, it was always said, 'He will never come to the throne.|$|E
5|$|On December 7, 2006, Iginla reached career {{milestones}} when {{he scored}} his 300th career goal and 600th career point against the Minnesota Wild. He {{was expected to}} play in the 2007 NHL All-Star Game in Dallas; however, he missed the game with a knee injury. The injury <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of 12 games in 2006–07. He nevertheless scored 94points, including a career-high 55assists.|$|E
50|$|In {{the final}} non-World Cup season of 1966, Kidd won three {{important}} races in Europe and was actually outracing Jean-Claude Killy. Kidd suffered {{the first of}} two major injuries that almost ended his career, an ankle sprain in late January, which resulted in a tendon operation. Later the same year he broke his right tibia in two places during downhill training at the 1966 World Championships, held in August in Portillo, Chile. The injury <b>kept</b> also <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of the first World Cup season of 1967. During this injury time he returned to college at the University of Colorado in Boulder.|$|R
60|$|Dolores's {{strong desire}} for a private {{interview}} with her uncle died away when Constance carried off the cheque. She knew he would tell her she {{had no right to}} give it, and {{she did not want to}} be told so, nor to have any special inquiries made. She was not sorry that an invitation from a neighbour <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> and Hal <b>out</b> shooting all Saturday, and, on the other hand, she so far shrank from Constance's talk about Mr. Flinders as not to be vexed that it was too wet on Sunday afternoon for any going down to Casement Cottages.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{would have}} been no harm at all to have <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> outside, but there would great harm come upon you if you put <b>him</b> <b>out</b> by force. But listen to the plan I have to get <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of the house by his own doing, without anyone putting him from it at all.' ...|$|R
5|$|On September 15, Yankees pitcher Chien-Ming Wang struck Youkilis on {{his right}} wrist with a pitch, {{resulting}} in a deep tendon bruise that <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> until September 25, when he returned {{with the aid of}} a cortisone shot. In 2007, Youkilis was 6th in the AL with 15 hit by pitch (HBP).|$|E
5|$|Pujols {{had three}} hits and four RBI, {{including}} his 1,000th career hit (a home run against Jerome Williams), as the Cardinals defeated the Cubs 9–3 on April 21, 2006. On June 4, {{he was placed}} on the disabled list (DL) {{for the first time in}} his career with a strained right oblique that <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> for three weeks.|$|E
5|$|A.J. Styles {{suffered}} a tendon injury during his title bout with Samoa Joe at Sacrifice. TNA management <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> {{of the following}} Impact! tapings, hoping to keep him rested and not risk any further injury despite expectations {{that he would not}} be sidelined long. Styles, however, canceled an appearance in the Ring of Honor promotion on August20. He came back for a promotion on August27 at their Dragon's Gate Invasion event, losing a match to CIMA.|$|E
50|$|When {{he got the}} opportunity, he went to {{the flying}} field, the Curtis School at Newport News, and asked if he could take a ride. Thomas Scott Baldwin, who had been a famous {{performer}} in his own balloons and dirigibles, was in charge and said yes. The plane was a Curtiss JN-4 Jenny and the pilot was Edward Stinson, a prominent flyer at the time who later founded the Stinson Aircraft Company. Stinson did a number of aerobatic maneuvers, including looping the loop five times in a row. Thompson said that the only thing that <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> from falling <b>out</b> of the plane {{at the top of the}} last loop was the lap belt. By the time he landed, he had decided to apply for duty in the Air Service.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is not so}} much {{afraid of}} papa as he was," [...] said Margaret. [...] "He has felt himself useful and a comfort, and papa is gentler; and that has cheered <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of the desponding way that <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> back from proposing anything." ...|$|R
60|$|What {{had once}} been only a narrow mesquite-bordered trail was now a well-trodden road. A deep {{irrigation}} ditch, full of flowing muddy water, ran parallel with the road. Gale had been curious about {{the operations of the}} Chases, but bitterness he could not help had <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> from going <b>out</b> to see the work. He was not surprised to find that the engineers who had constructed the ditches and dam had anticipated him in every particular. The dammed-up gulch made a magnificent reservoir, and Gale could not look upon the long narrow lake without a feeling of gladness. The dreaded ano seco of the Mexicans might come again and would come, but never to the inhabitants of Forlorn River. That stone-walled, stone-floored gulch would never leak, and already it contained water enough to irrigate the whole Altar Valley for two dry seasons.|$|R
5|$|Born in Kingston, Jamaica, Johnson {{started his}} career with Manchester United as a trainee in 1992, but a knee injury {{suffered}} {{at the start of}} the 1992–93 season <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> for over a year. After making his comeback in November 1993, he scored 12 goals in 22 competitive appearances for the club's youth teams, and was rewarded with a professional contract in July 1994. In 1994–95, he was part of the Manchester United youth team that won the FA Youth Cup.|$|E
5|$|Following the breakup, {{the former}} {{partners}} feuded {{for a while}} with Bagwell getting the better of Riggs. Riggs {{would go on to}} briefly feud with Raven, later joining The Flock, while Bagwell formed Vicious and Delicious with Scott Norton before suffering a severe neck injury that <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of action for a while. Bagwell later returned to WCW, teaming with Shane Douglas to win another tag team championship. After losing the championship, he formed another tag team, pairing with Lex Luger to form Totally Buffed.|$|E
5|$|He {{missed the}} entire 1991–92 season while he recovered, {{suffering}} a further knee injury in late 1991, when an incident at a nightclub on Tyneside <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> for even longer. The saga over Gascoigne's proposed transfer to Lazio dominated the tabloid press throughout 1991, often overshadowing the key national news {{of that time}} – namely the recession and rise in unemployment that it sparked – although the broadsheet newspapers generally kept stories about Gascoigne confined to their back pages.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're a blamed cool fellow," [...] Deering remarked. [...] "If you had {{not taken}} control, I expect we'd have jolted Jimmy off the stretcher, and maybe {{have gone through the}} snow-bridge the guide didn't spot. Then you stayed with <b>him,</b> pulled <b>him</b> <b>out</b> {{of the way of the}} snow-slides, and <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> warm. I expect you saved his life." ...|$|R
25|$|Later, Henri {{became a}} film {{executive}} representing Pathé (USA) in France through Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., {{who was running}} the studio. Many now assume {{he was given the}} position, which <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> in France for ten months a year, to simply keep <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of the way. This marriage ended in divorce in 1930 Soon after, Henri remarried, to actress Constance Bennett.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, Lagos renewed his {{contract}} with the club, signing a new three-year deal which <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> at the club until 2013. Lagos scored 2 goals against Larissa which led AEK winning 2-3. Lagos again suffered a knee injury against R.S.C. Anderlecht which forced <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of football for three months. Lagos made his comeback against Ergotelis, where the match finished 1-1.|$|R
5|$|In 1938, Hutson {{had nine}} {{touchdown}} receptions, again setting the league record, {{as he led}} the Packers to another NFL Championship Game, this time against the New York Giants. However, a knee injury he suffered four weeks earlier <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of the game's starting lineup. He entered as a substitute three separate times {{late in the game}} but was unable to be a factor, catching no passes as Green Bay was defeated 23–17.|$|E
5|$|In July 2000, {{he signed}} a new two-year deal with Torquay. However, only two games into the {{following}} season, {{he picked up a}} stomach tear, which <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> {{for the rest of the}} season. Without Brandon, Torquay could not match their high league position of the previous season, and finished 21st, four points above Barnet who were relegated out of The Football League.|$|E
5|$|In {{qualification}} for the 2006 World Cup, Baroš scored five {{goals for}} his country, including four in consecutive matches in 2005. An injury to his foot, {{picked up in}} a match on 3 June, <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of 2006 FIFA World Cup games against the United States and Ghana. He did appear in the Czechs' final group game against Italy, but appeared unfit and left the game after 64 minutes {{to be replaced by}} David Jarolím.|$|E
50|$|The Swallows <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> {{in their}} bathtub, but this proved too {{inconvenient}} {{within a few}} days. So George moved <b>him</b> <b>out</b> back to a spring fed pond where {{he set up a}} “pup tent” enclosed by a wire fence. Hoover lived very much like a family dog and even accompanied George riding into town with his head poking out of the window.|$|R
50|$|November 27, 2010, saw Denman {{trying to}} make history in the Hennessy Gold Cup. Only two other horses had won the race twice before, {{one of whom was}} Arkle. In trying to achieve an {{unprecedented}} third Hennessy, Denman for the third time had to shoulder 11 stone 12 pounds top weight. Only a handful of the field were in the handicap on official ratings, and the winner and second place runners carried bottom weight of 10 stone. Sam Thomas, who took the ride, replacing the injured Ruby Walsh, always <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> handy and <b>out</b> of trouble, but in the home straight, Diamond Harry matched strides and eventually passed Denman to win, with Burton Port staying on well into second place.Denman's trainer, Paul Nicholls, after the race was delighted with the run and informed the racing public that Denman would not be seen until the Cheltenham Gold Cup in March, where he would try to regain this prize which he last won in 2008.|$|R
5000|$|During the Twenties, {{magazines}} and periodicals <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> busy turning <b>out</b> over 100 illustrations a year. He started the decade by illustrating for the popular [...] "pulps" [...] of the period. By the mid-twenties he was {{a regular contributor to}} Liberty, Holland's Magazine, Maclean's, Blue Book, Green Book and Short Stories magazines. His illustrations captured the spirit of the times, most notably in 1922 when he was commissioned to do the illustrations for the serial [...] "Flaming Youth," [...] a phrase that became the symbol of that gay and gaudy decade. In 1924, Coleman completed 178 illustrations for various publications. But he would {{have to wait until the}} Depression Years to be a regular in the [...] "big leagues" [...] of Curtis, Crowell-Collier and Hearst Publishing Companies. By the end of the decade, he had become a regular contributor to Cosmopolitan, the flagship magazine of the Hearst magazine empire, and its sister publication, Good Housekeeping.|$|R
5|$|In the June 1977, Wark was {{selected}} for the Scotland squad for the first time, for a friendly match against East Germany; however, a torn hamstring sustained in pre-season training ended any chance of an international debut. The injury also <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of first-team football until January 1978, when he returned for a match against Cardiff City {{in the third round}} of the 1977–78 FA Cup.|$|E
5|$|On 22 November 2013, Manchester United {{announced}} that Carrick {{had signed a}} contract extension until 2015, with the option to extend for a further year. In the 2013–14 season, Carrick struggled to retain his previous season's form, as Manchester United struggled generally under new manager David Moyes. His season was not helped by a persistent achilles problem that <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> from November until December, whilst new signings in midfield such as Marouane Fellaini had failed to perform.|$|E
5|$|The 2011–12 season saw Totti {{initially}} receive few starts under Roma's {{new manager}} Luis Enrique, as the club's early struggles continued. Totti sustained an injury on 1 October 2011 {{in the second}} half of a match against Atalanta, which <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of action until the 20 November; he returned to the pitch against Lecce, when he came off the bench in the 66th minute, as Roma won the match 2–1.|$|E
50|$|Senthamarai was ill {{treated by}} his {{concubine}} {{who is now}} his wife. She <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> alive only for his property. She sleeps with another person & Senthamarai finds it. He confronts her & she {{with the help of}} her men, beat him to death & force him to sign the stamp paper thereby getting hold of all his property & kicks <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of the home.|$|R
60|$|She {{was not to}} {{know that}} the pallor which gave him so {{interesting}} an air, and the dark stains which lent his eyes that gentle wistfulness, were the advertisements at once of the debauch that had <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> from his bed until after two o'clock that morning and of the inexorable disease that slowly gnawed away his life and enraged <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of all humanity.|$|R
60|$|But {{the faster}} Edward died {{out of public}} {{knowledge}} and interest, the faster George rose in them. He was found lying, ragged and drunk, in the gutter one morning. A member of the Ladies' Temperance Refuge fished <b>him</b> <b>out,</b> took <b>him</b> in hand, got up a subscription for <b>him,</b> <b>kept</b> <b>him</b> sober a whole week, then got a situation for him. An account of it was published.|$|R
