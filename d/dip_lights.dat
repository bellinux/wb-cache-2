40|$|Among {{the group}} of extrasolar planets, transiting planets provide a great {{opportunity}} to obtain direct measurements for the basic physical properties, such as mass and radius of these objects. These planets are therefore highly important in the understanding of the evolution and formation of planetary systems: from the observations of photometric transits, the interior structure of the planet and atmospheric properties can also be constrained. The most efficient way to search for transiting extrasolar planets is based on wide-field surveys by hunting for short and shallow periodic <b>dips</b> in <b>light</b> curves covering quite long time intervals. These surveys monitor fields with several degrees in diameter and tens or hundreds of thousands of objects simultaneously. In the practice of astronomical observations, surveys of large field-of-view are rather new and therefore require special methods for photometric data reduction that have not been used before.

Significantly different SSS properties of CNe in the M 31 bulge and disk were indicated by recent X-ray population studies, which however considered {{only a small number}} of disk novae. We initiated a target of opportunity (ToO) program with XMM-Newton to observe the SSS phases of CNe in the disk of M 31 and improve the database for further population studies. We analysed two XMM-Newton ToO observations triggered in Aug 2011 and Jan 2012, respectively, and extracted X-ray spectra and light curves. We report the discovery of an X-ray counterpart to the M 31 disk nova M 31 N 2008 - 05 d. The X-ray spectrum of the object allows us to classify it as a SSS parametrised by a blackbody temperature of 32 +/- 6 eV. More than three years after the nova outburst, the X-ray light curve of the SSS exhibits irregular, broad dip features. These dips affect primarily the very soft part of the X-ray spectrum, which might indicate absorption effects. <b>Dipping</b> SSS <b>light</b> curves are rarely observed in M 31 novae.
