The study involved 24 males representing three groups: wild boars (6 animals), pigs (12 animals: 6 of Polish Landrace and 6 of Duroc breeds) and wild boar/domestic pig hybrids (6 animals). Wild boar/domestic pig hybrids were obtained by crossing DU pigs with wild boars. Samples of the LL were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen muscle samples were cut into 10 - μm sections.

The highest proportion of slow twitch oxidative fibres and fast twitch oxidative fibres, being indicative of high meat value, was characteristic of wild boar muscles. The lowest diameters of all three muscle <b>fibre</b> <b>types,</b> associated with the largest number of fibres in the analysed area, suggest that the meat had the most delicate structure.

40|$|The {{turnover}} of cytochrome c was determined {{in the three}} skeletal-muscle <b>fibre</b> <b>types</b> of adult male rats by a kinetic analysis that followed {{the time course of}} cytochrome c content change. Confirming evidence was obtained with double-labelling studies using delta-aminolaevulinate. Cytochrome c turnover was most rapid in the low-oxidative fast-twitch white fibre [t 1 / 2 (half-life) about 4 days], slowest in the high-oxidative fast-twitch red fibre (t 1 / 2 9 - 10 days) and relatively rapid in the high-oxidative slow-twitch red fibre (t 1 / 2 5 - 6 days). Thus cytochrome c turnover does not strictly conform to either the appearance (i. e. red or white) or the contractile characteristics (i. e. fast or slow) of the muscle fibres. The synthesis rates needed to maintain the corresponding cytochrome c concentrations, however, were similarly high in the two mitochondria-rich red <b>fibre</b> <b>types.</b> These data illustrate that both the synthesis and degradation processes are important in establishing the cytochrome c concentrations that distinguish the different skeletal-muscle <b>fibre</b> <b>types...</b>|$|R

Regionalization of <b>fibre</b> <b>type</b> composition occurs also within single neuromuscular partitions. The intraspinal position of motoneurones is often coarsely related to the intramuscular sites of their muscle units.

All subjects were untrained {{at the time of the}} study. The cross-sectional area of the knee-extensor muscles was measured at the mid-thigh level using computed tomography. Skeletal muscle samples were obtained by needle biopsy from the mid-point of m. vastus lateralis of the stronger leg of each subject. Samples were mounted, frozen and sectioned for histochemical analysis. On the basis of the pH dependent lability of the myosin ATP-ase reaction, fibres were classified as Type I, Type IIA or Type II B. Using computerized planimetry, muscle fibre cross-sectional areas were measured on serial sections stained for succinate dehydrogenase activity. As previously described, muscle strength (maximum voluntary contraction) was correlated with the muscle cross-sectional area (r = 0. 70, P less than 0. 01). The ratio of strength (in N) to cross-sectional area (in cm 2) was 8. 92 +/- 1. 01 (mean +/- S. D.) with a wide range of values, from 7. 09 to 10. 85. Muscle fibre composition of m. vastus lateralis in these subjects was 46. 1 +/- 10. 5 % Type I, 42. 8 +/- 11. 4 % Type IIA and 11. 1 +/- 9. 7 % Type IIB. After correction for differences in the cross-sectional areas of the different <b>fibre</b> <b>types,</b> the proportions of total area occupied by the different <b>fibre</b> <b>types</b> were: 43. 6 +/- 11. 9 % Type I, 46. 4 +/- 13. 1 % Type IIA and 10. 0 +/- 9. 1 % Type IIB.
