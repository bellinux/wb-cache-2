5|$|Pam apologizes to Jim that Roy {{attacked}} him but her assurance that {{her relationship with}} Roy is over for good is met with polite skepticism. Roy picks up his last paycheck, apologizes to Jim for threatening him during their previous encounter, and asks Pam to join him for coffee. Their meeting at a local diner is awkward and ends with their relationship (and even friendship) appearing to be over; they hug and Pam wipes a tear <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> Roy encourages Pam to pursue her feelings for Jim {{but she says she}} will not try to get him. Roy does not understand his long-time fiancée, especially her choice to not pursue Jim.|$|E
5|$|That night, Jack tells {{everyone}} that he trusts Juliet {{and that should}} be enough, but Sayid disagrees. Jack continues to explain that John Locke blew up the submarine that was to take him home. Claire suddenly collapses with blood gushing <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> Juliet takes Jack and Kate aside and tells them she knows what's wrong with Claire because she did it to her. At the camp, Juliet explains that Claire's immune system has turned against her due to a latent reaction to medication in her bloodstream. The medication was designed by Juliet to keep Claire alive during her pregnancy. She was brought to the island to find out why women couldn't have children. The mother's body treats the pregnancy as a foreign invader and the immune system attacks; every pregnant woman on the island has died. Claire was the first to survive even though she showed some of the symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The Pharisee Nicodemus {{supports}} Christ {{as he is}} lowered, and can {{be identified}} by his similarity to Simon the Pharisee in another canvas attributed to Bouts, Christ in the House of Simon. The Virgin wears a white headdress and a dark blue dress with a yellowish mantle, and holds Christ's arm just above his wrist as if afraid {{to let go of}} her dead son. She is supported by John the Evangelist, who wears a red robe. Dressed in green robes, Mary Salome stands to the Virgin's left, wiping tears <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> with the fold of her white headdress. Mary of Clopas is behind them, holding a red cloth over her mouth, while the Magdalen is in the foreground at Christ's feet, dressed in a heavily folded cloak. The man in the brown–green tabard at the feet of Christ is probably Joseph of Arimathea, who, according to Gospel, brought Christ's body to Golgotha from Pontius Pilate.|$|E

25|$|One {{persistent}} rumor {{was especially}} prevalent in Europe; fake news circulated that Shirley {{was not a}} child but a 30-year-old dwarf {{due in part to}} her stocky body type. The rumor was so prevalent that the Vatican dispatched Father Silvio Massante to investigate if she were indeed a child. The fact that she never seemed to miss any teeth led some people to conclude that she had all her adult teeth. Temple was actually losing her teeth regularly through her days with 20th Century Fox, most notably during the sidewalk ceremony in front of Grauman's Theatre, where she took off her shoes and placed her bare feet in the cement to take attention away <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> When acting, she wore dental plates and caps to hide the gaps in her teeth. Another rumor pertaining to her teeth was the idea that they were filed to make them appear like baby teeth.|$|E

25|$|Three 11-year-old boys rode {{their bikes}} {{into the west}} parking lot to {{purchase}} soft drinks. Hearing {{a member of the}} public yell something unintelligible from across the street, all three hesitated, before Huberty shot the three boys with his shotgun and Uzi. Joshua Coleman fell to the ground critically wounded in the back, arm, and leg; he later recalled looking toward his two friends, Omarr Alonso Hernandez and David Flores Delgado, noting that Hernandez was on the ground with multiple gunshot wounds to his back and had started vomiting; Delgado had received several gunshot wounds to his head. Coleman survived; Hernandez and Delgado both died at the scene. Huberty next noticed an elderly couple, Miguel Victoria Ulloa (74) and Aida Velazquez Victoria (69), walking toward the entrance. As Miguel reached to open the door for his wife, Huberty fired his shotgun, killing Aida with a gunshot to the face and wounding Miguel. An uninjured survivor, Oscar Mondragon, later reported that he had seen Miguel cradling his wife in his arms and wiping blood <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> Miguel shouted curses at Huberty, who approached and killed him with a shot to the head.|$|E
25|$|In 1988 Chikatilo {{killed three}} times, murdering an {{unidentified}} woman in Krasny Sulin in April and two boys in May and July. His first murder victim was lured off a train at Krasny Sulin before Chikatilo bound her hands {{behind her back}} and stuffed her mouth with dirt, before severing her nose <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> and inflicting numerous knife wounds to her neck. Chikatilo then bludgeoned her {{to death with a}} slab of concrete; her body was found on 6 April. Investigators noted that the knife wounds inflicted upon this victim were similar to those inflicted on the victims linked to the manhunt and killed between 1982 and 1985, but as the woman had been killed with a slab of concrete and had not been disemboweled, investigators were unsure whether to link this murder to the investigation. In May, Chikatilo killed a 9-year-old boy, named Aleksey Voronko, in Ilovaisk, Ukraine. The boy's wounds left no doubt the killer had struck again, and this murder was linked to the manhunt. On 14 July, Chikatilo killed 15-year-old Yevgeny Muratov at Donleskhoz station near Shakhty. Muratov's murder was also linked to the investigation, although his body was not found until April 1989. Although his remains were largely skeletal, Muratov's autopsy revealed he had been emasculated, and suffered at least 30 knife wounds.|$|E
500|$|In the video's conclusion, Gaga's {{silhouette}} struts in {{an alley}} in a tribute to Jackson's [...] "The Way You Make Me Feel" [...] video. Her face is misconstrued, with sharp horns protruding <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> glowing eyes, uneven hair, and a distinct Madonna-esque gap between her front teeth. Gaga has commented that she was teased as kids would call her [...] "rabbit teeth". She sheds a single tear as the pink triangle frame appears again, and inside it, a silhouette of Gaga sitting atop the unicorn. A city and a rainbow appear in the background, and Gaga is seen in her zombie makeup, chewing bubble gum and blowing it, as the pink triangle zooms away.|$|E

500|$|Actress {{and model}} Sherri Stoner {{served as the}} {{performance}} model for Belle, providing live-action reference for the animators as they drew the character. Belle's tendency to constantly brush her hair away <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> was also inspired by both Stoner and O'Hara. [...] "I was constantly doing that and little quirky things that they would catch," [...] O'Hara told The Guardian. The animators also incorporated O'Hara's eyes, cheekbones {{and the way in}} which she raises her eyebrow into Belle's face. O'Hara felt that Belle originally looked [...] "too perfect," [...] likening the character's appearance to actresses Elizabeth Taylor and Angelina Jolie. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Charles Solomon observed inconsistencies in Belle's appearance, writing, [...] "The prettiest and liveliest Belle waltzes with Beast in his marble ballroom and weeps over his body before he's transformed into the Prince" [...] while [...] "The Belle who receives the library from Beast has wider-set eyes and a more prominent mouth than the noticeably slimmer Belle who sings 'Something There'".|$|E
500|$|While at Sabrina's house, Carly Beth {{is shocked}} to find she is unable to remove the mask and that the mask has, in fact, become her face. She returns {{to the store and}} finds the owner waiting for her. The store owner tells her that the [...] "mask" [...] is {{actually}} a real living face. All the masks in the back room are deformed, monstrous, living faces. The store owner made them, but they started out beautiful but then became hideous. Every so often, a person puts one on and the mask possesses them. It can only be removed by a [...] "symbol of love", but if it attaches itself to her or another person again, it will be forever. Carly Beth screams in horror, and the other masks begin to pursue her. While running away from the masks, she realizes that the mold her mother made is a symbol of love. Carly Beth finds the mold and uses it to deter the masks and remove the mask <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> She returns home to her mother, tossing the mask away. Noah later bursts in and asks her, [...] "How do I look in your mask?" ...|$|E
500|$|To promote [...] "Oh Mother" [...] and Back to Basics, Aguilera {{performed}} the song {{on a number}} of occasions. On July 20, 2006, Aguilera {{performed the}} track at the Koko jazz club in London, which was held in front of 1,500 fans and invited guests. The 40-minute concert comprised songs from the then-upcoming Back to Basics and other songs, including [...] "Lady Marmalade" [...] (2001) and [...] "Beautiful" [...] (2002). MTV UK was positive toward the performance, wrote, [...] "The gig reflected the jazz club mood of Christina's new album, with a swinging brass-heavy backing band and fit dancers bounding sexily around the stage". Later, [...] "Oh Mother" [...] was also performed during her worldwide Back to Basics Tour (200607). As she performed the track, the clip of a man repeatedly punching a woman as blood dripped <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> appeared on the screen. The tour was preceded by newspaper headlines that flashed across a big screen, such as, [...] "Christina goes from 'dirrty' to demure" [...] and [...] "Christina cleans up her act". The performance is included on the video release [...] (2008). A live video of the performance of [...] "Oh Mother" [...] during the tour, taken from the accompanying DVD, was premiered in late 2007. Nick Levine for Digital Spy called it a [...] "cheap-looking" [...] video.|$|E

500|$|On February 8, 2011, Gaga tweeted {{the words}} [...] "Trois Jours" [...] ("Three Days"), {{along with a}} picture of the {{official}} single artwork, via TwitPic. Gaga is shown topless in the black-and-white cover art and displays the tattoos on her back. Her hair is air-blown and she wears heavy make-up while sharp edges protrude <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> and shoulders. The artwork was described by Charlie Amter from The Hollywood Reporter as harkening back to the classic record covers from the 1980s. He compared it to the artworks by bands like Missing Persons, Roxy Music and Duran Duran. Gordon Smart from The Sun also felt that the [...] "stark black and white image" [...] had a glossy eighties air about it. Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly gave a positive review of the cover art, feeling that Gaga looked almost [...] "animalistic" [...] in the picture, and her flowing hair made her look like a creature from the African jungle. She also added that the artwork was [...] "totally and completely fierce". Archana Ram from the same publication found similarities between the [...] "Born This Way" [...] cover art and [...] Kylie Minogue's cover art for her 2007 single [...] "2 Hearts". Nicole Eggenberger from OK! described the artwork as a perfect balance between the singer's [...] "wild side" [...] and her [...] "glamorous" [...] looks. Leah Collins from Dose believed that the extreme make-up and tattoos were an ironic play on the title of the song.|$|E
500|$|On the February 9, 2011, {{episode of}} The Ellen DeGeneres Show, singers Justin Bieber and James Blunt {{performed}} their own {{rendition of the}} song along with DeGeneres, improvising the music, while singing the chorus. During the show, Gaga confirmed via telephone, that she would perform [...] "Born This Way" [...] on February 13, 2011, at the 53rd Grammy Awards. Gaga arrived at the ceremony in a giant incubating vessel that was carried onto the red carpet by numerous fashion models. She later emerged from another bigger egg on stage, dressed in a high ponytail, gold bra top and long skirt, with black and gold makeup and pointed shoulders and horns protruding <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> The [...] "Born This Way" [...] performance was introduced by Ricky Martin. In the first few seconds after performing the intro of the song, Gaga emerged from the egg, and after the first chorus, she whipped {{her hair in a}} manner similar to singer Willow Smith. Before the [...] "No matter gay, straight or bi" [...] line of the song, an organ emerged from the stage floor. Gaga played the music on the organ, which was surrounded by mannequin heads submerged in gel, before belting out the rest of the bridge as her dancers surrounded her. Before leaving the stage, Gaga put on her trench and hat as the song faded out and Gaga and her dancers ended the performance with their hands put up in paws.|$|E
500|$|Method Studios was {{contracted}} {{to handle the}} film's visual effects work. The studio's supervisor Sean Faden, worked alongside the film's visual effects supervisor, Brad Parker throughout the production. Several of the film's scenes {{proved to be a}} challenge for the team. Director Reeves wanted the [...] "car-crash" [...] sequence to appear as if it were filmed uncut in first-person. Several plates were shot with the first involving actor Jenkins backing the car out of the gas station and swerving, the second plate shot had a model of the car capable of being spun mechanically on a [...] "rotisserie" [...] in front of a blue screen which could simulate the car's roll down the hill. Jenkins' stunt double and a dummy were placed in the car as the rotisserie spun with additional effects work used to animate the dummy as the car rolled. The two shots were then combined to deceive the viewer into believing that it was one complete shot. Houdini software was used for much of the film's shots which involved Abby in her vampiric form. Faden noted the techniques used in another challenging shot important to Abby's character in which she begins bleeding when she enters Owen's apartment without invitation. Faden stated, [...] "Normally in such a scene, the character would be shot on set, dressed in blood. But in this case, the timing of the bleeding was so dependent on the emotional beats of the scene that this technique wouldn’t have allowed us enough control." [...] Actress Chloë Grace Moretz was first shot with minimal prosthetic blood applied to her face for reference. Then using techniques utilized in a prior Method Studios film, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Faden had the Houdini software track Moretz's shaking movements and render the gradual release of blood <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E

500|$|A {{portion of}} the video is {{dedicated}} to the Broadway musical Cabaret. The video begins with soldiers in black leather uniforms in a cabaret with a close-up of a soldier passed out in female fishnet stockings and heels as another lone soldier stares into the distance. The scene then cuts to male dancers performing elaborate choreography while marching forward with a Star of David. As the intro of the song begins, Gaga is shown leading a funeral procession, carrying the Sacred Heart on a pillow. When the lyrics begin, she sits on a throne wearing an elaborate headpiece and binocular-like eyepieces, with a smoking pipe in her hand, watching her dancers perform a rigorous routine in the snow. Gaga is then seen as the character Sally Bowles from Cabaret, dancing and simulating sex acts with three men on a stage with twin beds surrounded by spotlights, all wearing nothing but underwear, intercut with shots of Gaga lying on a larger bed dressed in a red latex nun outfit. She subsequently appears dressed in a white hooded robe, reminiscent of Joan of Arc, with her dancers, interspersed with a shot of her as the nun, consuming a set of rosary beads. After this, Gaga and her dancers are shown in a sequence in black-and-white in their military uniforms performing a tribute dedicated to the late choreographer Bob Fosse, who won an Academy Award for his direction of the film version of Cabaret. Gaga is seen in a blonde bob and a similar outfit to one of Liza Minnelli's performance costumes. The video moves to a scene of her wearing a bra equipped with AR-15 rifle barrels [...] and her dancers performing another dance routine. She is then shown in the empty club, scenes of war breaking out flash by, and the lone soldier appears again. Going back to the Joan of Arc scene, she struggles with her dancers and disrobes. The video ends with her dressed as the nun, the film burning away <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> outwards. Klein explained that the video was, [...] "about a woman's desire to resurrect a dead love and who can not face the brutality of her present situation. The pain of living without your true love." ...|$|E
