25|$|The {{design of}} the {{motorized}} bicycle or motorbike varies widely according to intended use. Some motorized bicycles are powerful enough to be self-propelled, without use of the pedals. A development of the motorized bicycle is the moped, which commonly has only a vestigial pedal <b>drive</b> <b>fitted</b> primarily to satisfy legal requirements, and suitable only for starting the engine or for emergency use. The alternate design philosophy to the moped is the so-called motor-assist or pedal-assist bicycle. These machines utilize the pedals as the dominant form of propulsion, with the motor used only to give extra assistance when needed for hills or long journeys.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} study of the {{inclusive}} J/psi cross section at 2. 76 TeV and 5. 5 TeV. The energy dependence of the cross section, rapidity and transverse momentum distributions are evaluated phenomenologically. Their knowledge is crucial as a reference for the interpretation of A-A and p-A J/psi results at the LHC. Our approach is the following: first, we estimate the energy evolution of the pt-integrated J/psi cross section at mid-rapidity; then, we evaluate the rapidity dependence; finally, we study the transverse momentum distribution trend. Whenever possible, both theory driven (based on pQCD predictions) and functional form (data <b>driven</b> <b>fits)</b> calculations are discussed. Our predictions are compared with the recently obtained results by the ALICE collaboration in pp collisions at 2. 76 TeV.

25|$|Floppy disk <b>drives</b> {{are rarely}} <b>fitted</b> to modern {{computers}} and are obsolete for normal purposes, although {{internal and external}} <b>drives</b> can be <b>fitted</b> if required. Floppy disks may be the method of choice for transferring data to and from very old computers without USB or booting from floppy disks, {{and so they are}} sometimes used to change the firmware on, for example, BIOS chips. Devices with removable storage like older Yamaha music keyboards are also dependent on floppy disks, which require computers to process them. Newer devices are built with USB flash drive support.|$|R

Brunswick was the first mill to be converted to electric in Manchester.|$|R
40|$|This essay {{adopts a}} creative-critical {{approach}} {{in looking at}} the influence of cinema on the modern road novel. It is in agreement with Mills, in her 2006 work titled The Road Story and the Rebel: Moving Through Film, Fiction, and Television, that the road novel can only be understood as part of a wider genre, the road story, which encompass a broader spectrum of mediums, most notably film. Through exploration of classic texts in the genre – Kerouac, Wolfe, et al. – it demonstrates the extent of cinematic influence on the road novel’s gestation and development. In particular, the essay examines Kerouac’s concept of ‘the bookmovie’ and seeks to establish just how prescient and prophetic this has become. In so doing, it will posit that the author’s own road novel, The <b>Drive,</b> <b>fits</b> the criteria of the ‘bookmovie’ through its integration of cinematic homage, as well as its deployment of filmic style and technique...|$|R
