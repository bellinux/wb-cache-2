Recent findings included that 15% of players become a guild-leader at one time or another, but most generally find the job tough and thankless; and that players spend a considerable amount of time (often a third of their total time investment) <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are external to gameplay but part of the metagame.|$|E
25|$|In a 2015 study, BDSM {{relationships}} were suggested {{to have a}} higher level of connection, intimacy, trust and communication compared to individuals who do not practice BDSM. The study suggests that dominants and submissives exchange control for each other's pleasure and to satisfy a need. They mention that both parties enjoys pleasing their partner in any way they can. Submissive and Dominants who participated in their research, felt {{that this is one of}} the best things about BDSM. It gives a submissive pleasure to do things in general for their dominant. Where Dominant enjoys making their encounters all about the submissive. They enjoy <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> makes their submissive happy. Their findings suggest that submissives and dominants found BDSM play more pleasurable and fun. BDSM was also suggested to improve personal growth, romantic relationships, their sense of community, their sense of self, the dominants confidence, and help an individual cope with everyday things by giving them a psychological release.|$|E
25|$|Agnes, on {{the other}} hand, has a preprogrammed script in her head that {{contains}} all the social rules of conduct. She is easily embarrassed and uses most of her energies attempting to keep others from saying or <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> go against her rules. In other words, she escapes the nasty or difficult parts of life by defining them as taboo subjects. Agnes hides from reality behind the rules. If the rules do not offer shelter, she then escapes reality through pure avoidance. She {{does not want to}} talk about things that are unpleasant, unless, of course, she is discussing her sister’s poor excuse for a life. She avoids her daughter’s temper tantrum, assuming that her daughter will eventually work things out on her own. Agnes, in the meantime, does not have time to deal with all those emotions. Even though she suspects that her husband had an affair, she only asks the people whom she knows will not confirm her suspicions.|$|E

25|$|Otherwise, Ford's {{works are}} {{characterized}} by an aversion to <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> have been done before. This is perhaps most notable in his two Star Trek novels, The Final Reflection (1984) and How Much for Just the Planet? (1987). The Final Reflection {{is the story of}} a small group of Klingons who prevent a war between the Klingon Empire and the Federation while the regular series characters are relegated to cameo appearances. (This novel introduced the fictional language Klingonaase.) In the comedic How Much for Just the Planet?, the Enterprise crew compete with a Klingon crew for control of a planet, whose colonists are not happy with this and defend their peace in inventive ways, which soon make everything a farce, including a Vaudevillian pie fight. The book includes song lyrics that satirize many 20th century stage musicals. Both novels present the Klingons in a more positive light, not just as the token evil menace of the week.|$|E

Kelley noted that his own ambition to direct had deserted him after seeing difficulties Nimoy faced directing the previous two Star Trek films.|$|E

500|$|AllMusic defines [...] "progressive electronic" [...] as a subgenre of new age music which [...] "thrives in more {{unfamiliar}} territory. The {{styles that}} emerge are often {{dictated by the}} technology itself. Rather than sampling or synthesizing acoustic sounds to electronically replicate them, these composers tend to mutate the original timbres, sometimes to an unrecognizable state. True artists in the genre also create their own sounds." [...] Reynolds posits that [...] "the truly progressive edge in electronic music involves <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> can't be physically achieved by human beings manipulating instruments in real-time." ...|$|E
500|$|Chester Bennington {{stated in}} an {{interview}} with MTV News, which referred to Linkin Park's new style as being less technical and more organic: [...] "When it came to <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> felt very much like older Linkin Park, like mixing hip-hop with a rock chorus, [...] felt like, {{if we were going to}} do it, we need to really do it in a way that felt natural and felt original and felt like it was something we hadn't done in the past... there are hip-hop songs on the album—'Wretches and Kings', 'When They Come for Me'—they're like nothing the band have tried before: snarling, raw, dark and...strangely organic." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{player can}} travel {{with up to}} two party members at a time, which gain {{experience}} points {{at the same rate}} as the player character. Equipment and perks for party characters can be selected for different statistical effects or abilities. Players can loot corpses and various environmental objects. The protagonist also has the ability to [...] "influence" [...] their party members; by <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> impress them, the player increases their influence with them. Depending on the level of influence, party members may support the player character unconditionally or turn against the protagonist. The player can also exploit high influence by drawing party members to either the light side or the dark side, and some characters can even be trained to use the Force.|$|E

500|$|During production, {{the film}} {{underwent}} two name changes. The project was initially titled Seven, which became Ek Bataa Saat and finally 7 Khoon Maaf. In the film, Chopra's character ages from 20 to 65, and prosthetic makeup {{was used for}} her looks at different ages. Bhardwaj hired Hollywood special makeup effects artist Greg Cannom, who did the makeup for 2008's The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, to create seven looks for the character. Chopra found the most challenging period {{was that of the}} 65-year-old woman. The actress said, [...] "prosthetics had to play a heavy part but I’m happy that I pushed myself as the result is really fab. I had to be very careful of not <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> would damage the make-up". To make Chopra look authentic, the makeup team used Chopra's mother's and grandmother’s photos to create her look. She had to gain five kg weight to fit her aging character.|$|E
500|$|Hull was {{remembered by}} his comrades as an {{exceptional}} pilot and an affable, jovial personality. Jimmy Beedle, in his 1966 history of No.43 Squadron, called Hull {{one of its}} all-time great characters, citing him as {{a major factor in}} the squadron's [...] "high standard of flying and... outstanding squadron spirit". John Simpson, who joined the unit as a pilot officer two months after Hull, recalled finding [...] "a confidence when flying with Caesar that was wholly lacking otherwise." [...] "I have never seen anyone who could throw a fighter about with so much confidence as old Caesar," [...] said another pilot, quoted by Beedle. [...] "Nobody gave me so much confidence to have a lead from, nobody gave me so much exhilaration and fun. Following Caesar you found yourself getting more out of your machine than you had ever imagined was possible, <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> done by yourself would have made your hair stand on end." ...|$|E
500|$|Some critics {{opined that}} the Underwood {{character}} is less interesting once he achieves {{his goal of}} becoming president and actually has to govern. [...] "You could take the show seriously {{just as long as}} you didn’t have to take it seriously, as long as it only took place in the dream world of imaginary fantasy politics," [...] wrote Aaron Bady of The New Republic, who compared Underwood unfavorably with Josiah Bartlett of The West Wing. [...] "But when a cartoon becomes president, it starts to look too fake to be real, but too real to be a cartoon. Frank plays the role of President Bartlett, a cartoon president <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> would actually, in reality, be kind of great. But Bartlett was too good to be true, and the old Frank was too evil to be true. President Underwood is just too dull to be a fantasy, and so the props take center stage." ...|$|E

500|$|Zack Handlen {{gave the}} episode a [...] "B–" [...] and wrote that [...] "works {{far better than}} it deserves to", due largely to the {{performance}} of Hawkes and the [...] "bat shit weirdness" [...] of the plot. He was particularly critical of the [...] "self-serious" [...] and [...] "pompous" [...] tone of the episode. Handlen concluded that the episode was [...] "like watching someone's fan fiction getting brought to life". He did, however, write that [...] "there is something strangely fascinating about" [...] the premise; in particular, he was pleased with the conclusion, calling it the moment when [...] "things pick up". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris, despite noting the potential in the episode's theme of the relationship between writer and their characters, felt that [...] "Milagro" [...] betrayed Scully's personality and featured her <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> were out of character.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} she was cast as Lana, Kreuk had no idea who the {{character}} was in Superman lore. Her uncle, who owned a comic book shop, filled her in on the details and she learned more from the producers. Kreuk realized that the character in the comics and her character on the show were two different people. As a result, Kreuk learns about the development of Lana as Lana is learning in the show, just as Welling does with Clark Kent. When asked if her being cast as a traditionally red haired character caused outcry from fans, Kreuk believes that whoever did [...] "got over it pretty fast". By season three, Kreuk had decided to [...] "invest" [...] herself less in her character, as she felt that her character's ultimate development was entirely {{in the hands of the}} producers. She no longer became frustrated when the producers had Lana <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> Kreuk felt were out of character, instead trusting that they would find the right direction for the character.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written to humanize Sawyer {{and set up}} the love {{triangle}} between him, Kate and Jack. Kate was meant to look at Sawyer in a new way, and, according to Lindelof, think, [...] "wow, this guy is not just a belligerent." [...] The episode also shows the moral ambiguity of some characters by revealing more of their personalities, with the ones introduced as protagonists <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are generally not viewed as protagonist-like– an example being Jack beating Sawyer and eventually asking Sayid to torture him; and an antagonistic character, Sawyer, proving not to be solely antagonist-like– an example being his backstory and flashback, which show that he is not exclusively evil. Lindelof explained that he wanted Sawyer to [...] "come out of his shell a little, and say to the audience, 'you're supposed to like this guy'", further explaining, [...] "the root of him being an asshole is that these horrible things happened to him {{when he was a little}} kid, and he's really really angry." ...|$|E

According to Stewart, {{the reason for this is}} that [...] "it would not be right" [...] for the game to simply be ported, as the developers built the game to be platform-specific before the Wii U was announced, and goes on to mention that if they started building the game for the platform [...] " [...] would build it very differently and [...] would build it with unique functionality."

We believe this is the right choice, and I guarantee it will be worth the wait." [...] The Definitive Edition framerate is unlocked on PlayStation 4, varying from 32 to 60fps (averaging 53.36fps).
