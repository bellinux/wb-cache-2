40|$|Globus is a {{persistent}} or intermittent non-painful sensation of a lump or foreign {{body in the}} throat. It is a commonly encountered clinical condition that is usually long-lasting, difficult to treat, and {{has a tendency to}} recur. Furthermore, due to the uncertain etiology of globus, it remains difficult to establish standard investigation and treatment strategies for affected patients. As a first step for managing globus, careful history taking and nasolaryngoscopy are essential. Given the benign nature of the condition and the recent notion that gastroesophageal reflux disease is a major cause of globus, empirical therapy with a high dose of proton pump inhibitors is reasonable for patients with typical globus. If patients are nonresponsive to this therapy, <b>definitive</b> <b>assessments</b> such as endoscopy, multichannel intraluminal impedance/pH monitoring, and manometry should be considered.

40|$|Disorganized/Disoriented (D) {{attachment}} {{has seen}} widespread interest from policy makers, practitioners, and clinicians in recent years.

40|$|The {{failure of}} an F- 111 wing during a {{full-scale}} fatigue test had {{important implications for}} the structural integrity management of the RAAF F- 111 fleet. This failure was due to a fatigue crack which initiated in the bore of a fastener hole. To assure structural integrity, an automated ultrasonic inspection has been developed which will be applied to up to 1200 fastener holes in each wing. The holes are inspected from the lower surface and <b>definitive</b> <b>assessments</b> of wing serviceability must be made without removing fasteners. The inspection system uses focussed immersion probes to perform a 45 -degree angle-beam shear wave inspection, utilising full-waveform capture and post-processing. This style of complex, computer-based inspection system is new to the Australian Defence Organisation and challenged many existing engineering processes for performing NDT and interpreting the results. This paper reviews the application of automated ultrasonic inspection for the F- 111 lower wing skin and outlines some of the significant challenges for both the science behind the inspection and the associated engineering processes. The lessons learnt will aid the successful integration of new technologies into existing NDT practices in the future. 1...|$|R

30|$|In this review, I {{make the}} case that several recent {{developments}} suggest that our understanding of denitrification is about to markedly improve. At the organismal scale, new molecular methods are transforming our understanding of the organisms and communities that carry out denitrification (note that these methods are not the subject of this review, which focuses on the ecosystem scale and above). Methodological advances have led to improved quantification of the fluxes of all three gaseous products of denitrification. There have also been recent improvements in the development of remote sensing, geographic information system and simulation modeling tools for scaling gas flux measurements to larger areas. Stable isotope mass balance modeling and measurement techniques provide new approaches to constraining estimates of denitrification integrated over several temporal and spatial scales. Most fundamentally, there are new ideas and measurement approaches that can encompass the hotspot and hot moment phenomena that are so important for denitrification. Improved methods, applied in novel experimental designs that incorporate hotspot and hot moment phenomena and coupled with powerful scaling tools, have the potential to reduce the uncertainty in estimates of denitrification. These advances (reviewed below) suggest that we may soon have more <b>definitive</b> <b>assessments</b> of denitrification rates and of the importance of this process in ecosystem, landscape, regional and global N cycles.|$|R

40|$|The {{observation}} of a quantum speedup remains an elusive objective for quantum computing. The D-Wave quantum annealing processors {{have been at}} the forefront of experimental attempts to address this goal, given their relatively large numbers of qubits and programmability. A complete determination of the optimal time-to-solution (TTS) using these processors has not been possible to date, preventing definitive conclusions about the presence of a speedup. The main technical obstacle has been the inability to verify an optimal annealing time within the available range. Here we overcome this obstacle and present a class of problem instances for which we observe an optimal annealing time using a D-Wave 2000 Q processor with more than 2000 qubits. In doing so we are able to perform an optimal TTS benchmarking analysis, in comparison to several classical algorithms that implement the same algorithmic approach: single-spin simulated annealing, spin-vector Monte Carlo, and discrete-time simulated quantum annealing. We establish the first example of a limited quantum speedup for an experimental quantum annealer: we find that the D-Wave device exhibits certifiably better scaling than both simulated annealing and spin-vector Monte Carlo, with 95 % confidence, over the range of problem sizes that we can test. However, we do not find evidence for an unqualified quantum speedup: simulated quantum annealing exhibits the best scaling by a significant margin. Our construction of instance classes with verifiably optimal annealing times opens up the possibility of generating many new such classes, paving the way for further <b>definitive</b> <b>assessments</b> of speedups using current and future quantum annealing devices.

40|$|This {{report is}} an {{assessment}} of all available literature that pertains to the potential risk of cancer associated with ingestion of asbestos. It was compiled by a working group to assist policy makers in the Department of Health and Human Services determine if adequate information was available for a <b>definitive</b> risk <b>assessment</b> on this potential problem and evaluate if the weight of evidence was sufficient to prioritize this issue for new policy recommendations. The work group considered the basis for concern over this problem, the body of toxicology experiments, the individual epidemiologic studies which have attempted to investigate this issue, and the articles that discuss components of risk assessment pertaining to the ingestion of asbestos. In the report, the work group concluded: 1) that no direct, <b>definitive</b> risk <b>assessment</b> can be conducted at this time; 2) that further epidemiologic investigations will be very costly and only possess sufficient statistical power to detect relatively large excesses in cancers related to asbestos ingestion; and 3) that probably the most pertinent toxicologic experiments relate to resolving the differences in how inhaled asbestos, which is eventually swallowed, is biologically processed by humans, compared to how ingested asbestos is processed. The work group believes that the cancer risk associated with asbestos ingestion should not be perceived {{as one of the}} most pressing potential public health hazards facing the nation. However, the work group does not believe that information was sufficient to assess the level of cancer risks associated with the ingestion and therefore, this potential hazard should not be discounted, and ingestion exposure to asbestos should be eliminated whenever possible...|$|R

That study by Christopher S. Koper, Daniel J. Woods, and Jeffrey A. Roth of the Jerry Lee Center of Criminology, University of Pennsylvania found no statistically significant evidence that either {{the assault weapons ban}} or the ban on magazines holding more than 10 rounds had reduced gun murders. However, they concluded that it was [...] "premature to make <b>definitive</b> <b>assessments</b> of the ban's impact on gun crime," [...] and argue that if the ban had been in effect for more than nine years, benefits might have begun to appear. Furthermore the authors also report that [...] "there has been no discernible reduction in the lethality and injuriousness of gun violence, based on indicators like the percentage of gun crimes resulting in death or the share of gunfire incidents resulting in injury." [...] A 2002 study by Koper and Roth found that around the time when the ban became law, assault weapon prices increased significantly, but this increase was reversed in the several months afterward due to a surge in assault weapons production that occurred just before the ban took effect. A study conducted by Dube in 2013, showed that the passing of the FAWB in 1994 had an insignificant impact on violent crime in Mexico, while the expiration of the FAWB in 2004 combined with political instability was correlated with an increase in gun-related homicides among Mexican municipalities near the border. Also in 2013, Koper reviewed the literature on the ban's effects and concluded that its effects on crimes committed with assault weapons were mixed due to its various loopholes. He also concluded that the ban did not seem to affect gun crime rates, but may have been able to reduce shootings if it had been renewed in 2004.|$|R
40|$|This {{draft report}} {{examines}} {{the effectiveness of}} the multiple-regulator model in supporting a single national consumer policy framework, and invites feedback from the public. This draft report was released on 8 December 2016. You are invited to examine the draft report and to make written submissions by Monday 23 January 2017. The final report is expected to be handed to the Australian Government by March 2017. Key points 	Despite the adoption of a single Australian Consumer Law (ACL) in 2011, Australia 2 ̆ 7 s consumer protection framework remains complex: 	 		Two Commonwealth and eight State and Territory regulators administer and enforce the generic ACL. 		Numerous specialist safety regulatory regimes complement the ACL. 		Redress is provided via ombudsmen, tribunals and courts, as well as most ACL regulators. 	 	 	The multiple-regulator model for the ACL appears to be operating reasonably effectively given the intrinsic challenges in having 10 regulators administer and enforce one law. 	 		The ACL regulators communicate, coordinate and collaborate with each other through well-developed governance arrangements. 		Some regulators have been criticised for undertaking insufficient enforcement. Limited resources may partly explain this. 		However, the limited evidence available on regulators 2 ̆ 7 resources and performance makes <b>definitive</b> <b>assessments</b> difficult. 	 	 	There is scope to strengthen the ACL 2 ̆ 7 s administration and enforcement. Matters to be addressed include: 	 		developing a national database of consumer complaints and incidents 		providing all State and Territory ACL regulators with the full suite of enforcement tools 		increasing maximum financial penalties for breaches of the ACL 		exempting interim product bans from Commonwealth regulatory impact assessments 		centralising powers for interim product bans and compulsory recalls in the ACCC 		improving the transparency of the resourcing and performance of the ACL regulators. 	 	 	The ACL regulators and specialist safety regulators generally understand the delineation of their remits and interact effectively, notwithstanding a handful of problematic cases. Consumers and suppliers are not always clear about which regulator to contact but they are typically redirected to the right regulator in a timely manner. 	Interactions between ACL and specialist safety regulators could be enhanced through: 	 		greater information sharing between ACL and specialist regulators 		addressing deficiencies in the tools and remedies available to specialist regulators 		regular national forums of building and construction regulators 		greater national consistency in the laws underpinning electrical goods safety. 	 	 	Governments should revisit previous Productivity Commission recommendations on industry- specific consumer regulation, consumer dispute resolution, consumer research and advocacy, and access to justice...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- Soil {{environmental}} quality is {{the capacity of}} a soil to function, within ecosystem and land use boundaries, to sustain biological productivity, maintain {{environmental quality}}, and promote plant, animal and human health'. In the long-term, vegetative rehabilitation of mining wastes aims at, as far as possible, the proper ecological integration of the reclaimed area into the surrounding landscape, which is sustainable and requires minimal maintenance. This article presents here an indicator-based system of soil environmental quality that evaluates sustainable rehabilitation of mine waste {{through a set of}} 2 subindicators, chemical fertility and stocks of organic matter, and further combines them into a single general Indicator of Soil Quality (GISQ). The design and calculation of the indicators were based on sequences of multivariate analyses. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to assess soil quality overall. A GISQ combined the different subindicators providing a global assessment of soil environmental quality. Our findings provide evidence that selected indicators can provide a <b>definitive,</b> quantitative <b>assessment</b> of soil environmental quality and lend credence to the value of our approach in quantifying relationships between soil function and indicators for specific areas...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of risk {{communication}} in genetic counseling, {{there appears to be}} a tension between clients seeking an authoritative, <b>definitive</b> risk <b>assessment</b> and the geneticist-expert actively defining the boundaries of his or her (in) expertise through formulation of uncertainty that is such a feature of genetic disorders. In the process of demarcating his or her zone of expertise, he or she defers to the judgment of other medical colleagues with expertise in "adjacent" areas. Our claim is that the genetic counselor delineates his or her (in) expertise through a systematic deployment of a range of modalized discourse strategies (e. g., contrast and hedging) while claiming authority in a limited knowledge field. At the broader professional level, this is motivated in part by the limits to professional knowledge and in part by the desire to maintain a "nondirective" (i. e., neutral) stance. Our analysis focuses on the expert formulation of uncertainty in a single counseling session around 4 strategic moments: (a) display of specialist knowledge, (b) pronouncement of considered judgment, (c) response to clients' volunteered information, and (d) maintenance of a nondirective stance in the face of explicit advice seeking by clients...|$|R
40|$|In {{studies to}} assess the {{accuracy}} of a screening test, often <b>definitive</b> disease <b>assessment</b> is too invasive or expensive to be ascertained on all the study subjects. Although {{it may be more}} ethical or cost effective to ascertain the true disease status with a higher rate in study subjects where the screening test or additional information is suggestive of disease, estimates of accuracy can be biased in a study with such a design. This bias is known as verification bias. Verification bias correction methods that accommodate screening tests with binary or ordinal responses have been developed; however, no verification bias correction methods exist for tests with continuous results. We propose and compare imputation and reweighting bias-corrected estimators of true and false positive rates, receiver operating characteristic curves and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for continuous tests. Distribution theory and simulation studies are used to compare the proposed estimators with respect to bias, relative efficiency and robustness to model misspecification.
