5|$|As time passes, {{with no sign}} of land {{or other}} ships, Parker {{suggests}} that one of them should be killed as food for the others. They draw straws, following the Custom of the Sea and Parker is sacrificed. This gives the others a reprieve, but Augustus soon dies from wounds received when they reclaimed the Grampus, and several more storms batter the already badly <b>damaged</b> <b>ship.</b> Pym and Peters float on the upturned hull and are close to death when they are rescued by the Jane Guy, a ship out of Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Johner (Ron Perlman) is a {{crew member}} and {{mercenary}} on the Betty. After the crew boards the Auriga they encounter Number 8, whom Johner tries to seduce. She overpowers him, attacking {{the rest of the}} crew as well. The Aliens escape captivity, forcing Johner and {{the rest of the crew}} to collaborate with Number 8 to escape from the Auriga. When he asks Number 8 how Ellen Ripley defeated the Aliens, she replies that Ripley died. Aboard the Betty, Johner and Vriess co-pilot their <b>damaged</b> <b>ship</b> to Earth.|$|E
5|$|Musial {{enlisted in}} the United States Navy on January 23, 1945, during World War II. He was {{initially}} assigned to noncombat duty at the Naval Training Station in Bainbridge, Maryland. In June 1945, {{he was assigned to}} Special Services in Hawaii, and was assigned to a ferry launch unit to bring back <b>damaged</b> <b>ship</b> crews entering Pearl Harbor where he was able to play baseball every afternoon in the naval base's eight-team league. After being granted emergency leave to see his ailing father in January 1946, he was briefly assigned to the Philadelphia Navy Yard before his honorable discharge from the Navy as a Seaman Second Class in March 1946.|$|E

2500|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity as Commanding Officer of the USS SANTA FE, {{in action}} against enemy Japanese forces, October 13, to 17, 1944. [...] Skilled and courageous in directing his command in its assigned missions {{to protect the}} withdrawal of two severely <b>damaged</b> <b>ships</b> from enemy infested waters, Rear Admiral Wright contributed essentially to the expeditious accomplishment of his hazardous salvage operation, providing efficient and effective support against hostile air attacks and making possible the successful reclamation of the <b>damaged</b> <b>ships...</b>|$|R
5|$|The Japanese erroneously {{announced}} that Maryland had been sunk, but on 30 December, the <b>damaged</b> <b>ship</b> entered Puget Sound Navy Yard for repairs just behind Tennessee. Two {{of the original}} twelve 5 in/51 cal guns were removed and the 5in/25 cal guns were replaced by {{an equal number of}} 5 in/38 cal dual purpose guns. Over {{the course of the next}} two months, she was repaired and overhauled, receiving new fighting equipment. Repairs were complete on 26 February 1942. She then underwent a series of shakedown cruises to West Coast ports and the Christmas Islands. She was sent back into action in June 1942, the first ship damaged at Pearl Harbor to return to duty.|$|E
5|$|The old President Warfield was {{eventually}} acquired in early 1947 by Mossad Le'aliyah Bet, a Jewish organization helping Holocaust survivors illegally reach Palestine, then under British mandate. The former Baltimore Steam Packet and U.S. Navy steamship was renamed Exodus when she embarked from France for Palestine on July 11, 1947, carrying 4,515passengers. Two Royal Navy destroyers rammed the Exodus {{as she entered}} Palestinian waters near Haifa on July18. British forces boarded the <b>damaged</b> <b>ship</b> and eventually deported the passengers. The Exodus remained in Haifa harbor until 1952, when the derelict caught fire and burned completely. The 1960 film Exodus depicted the refugees' odyssey aboard the former President Warfield.|$|E
5|$|As {{the group}} makes {{their way through}} the <b>damaged</b> <b>ship,</b> they swim through a flooded kitchen. They are chased by two xenomorphs. One is killed, while the other snatches Hillard. As they escape the kitchen, the xenomorph returns and blinds Christie, who sacrifices himself to kill the xenomorph so the others can escape. After Wren betrays the group, Call is {{revealed}} to be an auton, an improved version of a human created by synthetics. Using her ability to interface with the Aurigas systems, Call sets it {{on a collision course with}} Earth, hoping to destroy the xenomorphs in the crash. She cuts off Wren's escape route and directs the xenomorphs towards him. Ripley 8 is captured by a xenomorph, while the others head for the Betty. Wren, who is already aboard, shoots Purvis, takes Call hostage and demands that she abort the collision. An injured Purvis attacks Wren and forces Wren's head to his chest just as the xenomorph embryo he is carrying bursts through his ribcage, causing it to go through Wren's head too, killing them both. The survivors shoot and kill the juvenile xenomorph.|$|E
50|$|Flooding {{along the}} Rhine {{watershed}} was less severe {{in terms of}} flood <b>damage.</b> <b>Shipping</b> was halted on extensive stretches of the Rhine, Main, and Neckar rivers.|$|R
50|$|A 15,000 ton {{floating}} dock was located at Dyke Point in 1943 to repair <b>damaged</b> <b>ships</b> during World War II. The {{floating dock}} was scrapped in 1977.|$|R
50|$|Both fleets avoided {{further action}} {{prior to the}} {{hurricane}} season. Guichen returned to France with many of his <b>damaged</b> <b>ships</b> in August, and Rodney sailed for New York.|$|R
5|$|On 13 July U-255 {{found the}} 7,168 ton Dutch {{merchant}} ship Paulus Potter abandoned and drifting, with 2,250 tons of general goods, ammunition, 34 tanks, 15 aircraft and 103 trucks aboard. The ship {{had been attacked}} by Ju 88 dive bombers of III./KG 30 east-north-east of Bear Island on 5 July, the day after Convoy PQ 17 dispersed. The crew had abandoned the badly <b>damaged</b> <b>ship,</b> believing {{it was about to}} sink. All 76 of the crew had taken five days to reach land at Novaya Zemlya, eventually being rescued by a Soviet whaling vessel. After finding her the II.WO and two mates from U-255 boarded the ship, and attempted to start the engines, but the engine room was flooded. They then searched the vessel, taking blankets, cigarettes, and other useful materials, including confidential documents found on the bridge, and the ship's ensign as a prize, before the ship was sunk with a single torpedo. U-255 returned to Narvik on 15 July.|$|E
5|$|There, Loki tricks Malekith into {{drawing the}} Aether out of Jane, but Thor's attempt {{to destroy the}} exposed {{substance}} fails. Malekith merges with the Aether and leaves in his ship as Loki is fatally wounded while killing Algrim. Thor, cradling Loki in his arms, promises to tell their father of his sacrifice. Afterwards, Thor and Jane discover another portal in a nearby cave and reunite in London with Darcy and Jane's mentor Dr. Erik Selvig — who was briefly institutionalized due to the mental trauma he suffered during Loki's attack on Earth. They learn that Malekith plans to restore the Dark Elves to dominance by unleashing the Aether {{at the center of}} the Convergence in Greenwich. Thor battles Malekith through various portals and across multiple worlds until one portal separates them, leaving Malekith unopposed on Earth. Thor returns in time to help his mortal comrades use their scientific equipment to transport Malekith to Svartalfheim, where he is crushed by his own <b>damaged</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Whitehurst circled, {{apparently}} out of control. Yet, when Vigilance {{caught up}} with the <b>damaged</b> <b>ship</b> and came alongside at 1530, the more serious fires on board the escort vessel had been controlled. Vigilance's fire fighting and damage control parties helped to extinguish the remaining blaze and made emergency repairs.|$|E
50|$|Tourville’s {{fleet of}} badly <b>damaged</b> <b>ships</b> was swept by wind and tide {{down the coast}} of the Cotentin peninsula, pursued by an English fleet under Russell. Three of the most badly <b>damaged</b> <b>ships</b> were beached at Cherbourg, where they were {{attacked}} and destroyed by an English squadron under Vice Admiral of the Red Sir Ralph Delaval.The remaining ten French ships, with Tourville and four of his flag officers, were swept down the coast, to be beached on the evening of 21 May (OS) outside the small port of Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue.|$|R
40|$|In 1996, the 22 nd ITTC {{formed a}} Specialist Committee on Ship Stability. There were two main {{mandates}} given to this committee. The first {{was to examine}} the techniques for carrying out model experiments used to investigate the capsize of intact and <b>damaged</b> <b>ships</b> and provide guidelines for carrying out these experiments. The second was to assess the methods available for numerical simulations of the capsize of intact and <b>damaged</b> <b>ships.</b> This paper describes the findings of the committee so far, {{at the end of its}} second year of a three year term. The committee has prepared a summary of the state of the art in the areas of numerical and physical modeling of intact and <b>damaged</b> <b>ships.</b> It has also circulated a questionnaire concerning the type of numerical methods used by ITTC member organizations for predicting the capsize of intact and <b>damaged</b> <b>ships.</b> Another major objective of the committee is to 'benchmark' codes against a standard hull form, for which there are well documented experiments. The hull form chosen was a container ship tested at Osaka University. This paper provides a brief summary of the findings of the committee in each of the four subject areas and makes recommendations for standard model test methods for intact and damaged capsize predictions. It also discusses the preliminary findings from the questionnaire. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

25|$|In 2199, {{after five}} years of attacks by an alien race known as Gamilas, the Earth Defense Force {{launches}} a counter-offensive near Mars. The fleet's weapons are no match for the Gamilas, who easily wipe out much of the force. During the battle, EDF captain Mamoru Kodai volunteers to use his <b>damaged</b> <b>ship,</b> the destroyer Yukikaze, as a shield to cover Captain Jyuzo Okita's ship, allowing his escape. Mamoru's ship is destroyed.|$|E
25|$|British naval {{intelligence}} in June reported the Germans' intention {{to bring out}} major naval units to attack the next eastbound convoy, east of Bear Island. Thus German forces would operate close to the Norwegian coast, with support of shore-based air reconnaissance and striking forces, with a screen of U-boats in the channels between Spitsbergen and Norway. Allied covering forces, on the other hand, would be without air support, one thousand miles from their base, and with the destroyers too short on fuel to escort a <b>damaged</b> <b>ship</b> to harbour.|$|E
25|$|Kattegat {{was later}} {{salvaged}} by the Norwegian military, with 1,400 tons of diesel and 207 barrels of grease unloaded at Svolvær. On 15 May, before Kattegat {{was ready to}} sail to Tromsø, she was bombed and damaged by a German aircraft. As the <b>damaged</b> <b>ship</b> still held 5,000 tons of oil, the local fishing boat fleet helped themselves to the cargo until the Germans arrived to retake the ship after the capitulation of mainland Norway in June. The short time Kattegat was in Norwegian hands she served under the name MT Bodø.|$|E
5000|$|Consequently, the {{shipyard}} operations at Gouvia were restricted to basic maintenance such as cleaning and caulking; many captains, instead of repairing their <b>damaged</b> <b>ships</b> at the arsenal, chose to sink them.|$|R
5|$|By this time, the 4th Destroyer Flotilla {{had been}} largely {{destroyed}} as a fighting unit. The few remaining, heavily <b>damaged</b> <b>ships</b> had been scattered and would take no further part in the battle.|$|R
50|$|In Pacific 1940 and Europe 1940, however, battleships (and {{aircraft}} carriers) are not repaired {{at the end}} of combat, {{and must}} be moved to a naval base for repair. Other Axis & Allies-like games have further elaborated on the capital <b>ship</b> <b>damage</b> mechanic, such as limiting the attack and defense capabilities of damaged battleships or requiring IPCs be paid for repairing <b>damaged</b> <b>ships.</b> In Guadalcanal, whose combat mechanics are different, <b>damaged</b> <b>ships</b> follow the same principle: battleships (along with destroyers, cruisers, and carriers) are damaged on a roll of 2 and destroyed on a roll of 1; in the event that a <b>ship</b> is <b>damaged</b> and not destroyed as a result of combat, it immediately returns to the player's home base, where it cannot move until it is repaired.|$|R
25|$|Sailing on 3 August for Okinawa, West Virginia reached Buckner Bay on 6 August—the day Little Boy, {{the first}} atomic bomb, was {{dropped on the}} city of Hiroshima. At 9:15pm on 10 August, West Virginia picked up a radio report that the Japanese {{government}} agreed to surrender {{under the terms of}} the Potsdam Declaration if its people could keep the Emperor of Japan as their ruler. Although the ships in the bay soon began celebrating, on 12 August Pennsylvania was torpedoed; West Virginia sent a whaleboat the next day with pumps for the <b>damaged</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|E
25|$|Paris {{returned}} to commercial service and in December rescued 22 of 23 seaman aboard the British Vindobala before the tanker sank during a bad winter storm. While westbound on 2 May 1899, Paris ran aground {{in the fog}} on the Manacles off of the coast of Cornwall. At first, {{she appeared to be}} a total loss and was not refloated for two months. After she was pulled from the rocks, the badly <b>damaged</b> <b>ship</b> was rebuilt at Belfast, Ireland, receiving new engines and having her triple smokestacks replaced by a pair of taller ones. Renamed Philadelphia, she finally resumed North Atlantic passenger service in August 1901.|$|E
25|$|Lindemann, {{guided by}} the {{tactical}} situation, wanted to destroy the <b>damaged</b> <b>ship.</b> He estimated a two- to three-hour chase would be enough. Lütjens, mindful of the fleet order to avoid unnecessary fighting with enemy capital ships, rejected his protests without discussion. Lütjens was suspicious of the intelligence he was receiving, which days earlier had told him Hood was still based in North Africa. He {{could no longer be}} sure of how many more enemy capital ships could be in the area. A time-consuming battle with Prince of Wales was out of the question, and he proceeded into the vast expanses of the Atlantic, where he could lose his pursuers and have the necessary room to manoeuvre.|$|E
5000|$|U-95 {{continued}} {{the business of}} <b>damaging</b> <b>ships</b> when she attacked, but did not sink, Walotira [...] northwest of Rockall on 26 December 1940. This vessel met her end due to the actions of U-99 on the 27th.|$|R

500|$|In {{the year}} 2285, Admiral James T. Kirk oversees a {{simulator}} session of Captain Spock's trainees. [...] In the simulation, Lieutenant Saavik commands the starship [...] on a rescue mission {{to save the}} crew of the <b>damaged</b> <b>ship</b> Kobayashi Maru. When the Enterprise enters the Klingon Neutral Zone to reach the ship, it is attacked by Klingon cruisers and critically damaged. The simulation is a no-win scenario designed to test the character of Starfleet officers. Later, Dr. McCoy joins Kirk on his birthday; seeing Kirk in low spirits, the doctor advises Kirk to get a new command and not grow old behind a desk.|$|E
500|$|Macnamara {{considered}} {{plans to}} use ship's boats to attack Amazone directly, but resolved to attempt to enter [...] the bay again {{on the morning of}} 25 March. As dawn broke however it became apparent that Rosseau had abandoned his <b>damaged</b> <b>ship</b> with his crew, setting the frigate on fire as he departed. By {{the end of the day}} Amazone had been burnt to the waterline and destroyed. Macnamara's squadron returned to their blockade duties off Cherbourg. The remaining frigate in the region, Iphigénie, did eventually succeed in breaking out of Cherbourg, but was intercepted and captured in the Atlantic during a raiding mission in January 1814.|$|E
500|$|Lucas and Clark {{remained}} off Sumatra until basic repairs {{could be}} completed before Arrogant then took [...] Victorious under tow, leading the <b>damaged</b> <b>ship</b> back to Penang and then Madras for repairs, arriving on 6 October. Sercey abandoned {{plans for an}} attack on Penang and sailed northwards to King's Island in the Mergui Archipelago. There his ships underwent extensive repairs, some even replacing their lower masts. In October the squadron swept eastwards to the Ceylon coast before turning back west towards Batavia, where Sercey hoped the supply depots would provide more support than those on Île de France. The squadron remained at Batavia throughout the winter, ceding control of the Indian Ocean trade routes to the British.|$|E
25|$|The only {{facilities}} in the vicinity able to service or supply a ship, or provide medical care, were in the Falkland Islands. The businesses there were so notorious for price-gouging that <b>damaged</b> <b>ships</b> were sometimes abandoned at Port Stanley.|$|R
