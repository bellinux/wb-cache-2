50|$|In 1948, Coaticook {{was sold}} for {{stripping}} and in 1949, she was sunk as a breakwater at Powell River in British Columbia {{to replace the}} floating breakwater that had been installed. In 1961, the hull was refloated {{in an effort to}} tow it to Victoria, British Columbia to be broken up. However en route, a storm arose and the hull suffered damage. The damage was considered significant enough to render the hull structurally unstable. The decision was made to scuttle it instead of continuing on to Victoria. Four cases of forcite, a <b>gelatin</b> <b>dynamite,</b> were placed throughout the ship. The ship was sunk near Race Rocks, off Vancouver Island in February 1962. Photos of the resulting explosion were taken and distributed through The Canadian Press.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 1943 Tupelo {{serviced}} aids to navigation (ATON), did search and recovery work near Norfolk, Virginia and broke ice in Chesapeake Bay. Tupelo was refitted as a Navy Damage Control Ship at the United States Coast Guard Yard Baltimore, Maryland in 1943. En route to the Pacific Theatre of Operations, via the Panama Canal, Tupelo went {{to the aid of}} the seagoing tugboat MV Atengo, which was in peril off the western coast of Mexico in a hurricane. During the rescue a crewman of Atengo had his hand mangled in an accident. Tupelo's surgeon treated the man and had to amputate his thumb. Tupelo was at Kwajalein Atoll next, en route to Guam with a convoy of Landing Craft Infantry (LCIs) [...] In 1944 she took tow of USS Oregon (BB-3) from a U.S. Navy seagoing tug, the Oregon was then a hulk {{to be used as a}} dynamite barge in Guam. Tupelo towed Oregon 100 miles to Guam. Upon arrival in Guam, which was still held by the Japanese Tupelo received her baptism under fire, while the U.S. fleet shelled the island. Tupelo's crew blasted a channel in the reef on the south side of Guam to accept Oregon's draft. Oregon was loaded with 1500 tons of 40 percent <b>gelatin</b> <b>dynamite.</b> From 1944 to 1946 Tupelo was assigned to Navy Service Squadron Four, the [...] "Harbor Stretchers", U.S. Navy CINCPAC and served in the Pacific Theater establishing and maintaining over 50 massive moorings for U.S. Navy ships with 15 ton anchors and 2-1/2 inch chain. She was also used to set buoys around minefields and to transport tons of dynamite to U.S. forces throughout the Pacific Islands. Tupelo was also responsible for maintaining Aids to Navigation (ATON) at Guam.|$|E
40|$|In the Sri Lankan context, <b>Gelatin</b> <b>Dynamite</b> {{has been}} one of the widely used {{explosives}} far rock blasting purpases. Water-gel (WG) explosive is in the process of being introduced to. the Sri Lankan mining industry. So. far there had been only a very few tests conducted to. assess the suitability and to. evaluate the performance of this explosive with ather available explosives. Complaints made by the users as regard to. the performance of WG have been a cause of concern. In this research, performance comparison of WG with Dynamite as regards rack break-aut in underground tunnelling has been carried aut. Comparison of fragmentation with the evaluation of particle size distribution in concrete block blasting, using three types of explosives (WG, Dynamite &Emulsian) {{has been one}} of main tests. Gap sensitivity, density and the determination of Velocity of Detonation has also. been carried aut...|$|E
50|$|Explosives {{considerably}} {{differ from}} one another as to their behavior {{in the presence of}} water. <b>Gelatin</b> <b>dynamites</b> containing nitroglycerine have a degree of water resistance. Explosives based on ammonium nitrate have little or no water resistance due to the reaction between ammonium nitrate and water, which liberates ammonia, nitrogen dioxide and hydrogen peroxide. In addition, ammonium nitrate is hygroscopic, susceptible to damp, hence the above concerns.|$|R
40|$|This work {{reviews the}} {{technique}} of assessing the performance of commercial explosives through the fragmentation of cast iron blocks. The rock blasting simulation was performed through the blasting of 24 kg cast iron blocks with 35 g charges of commercial explosives. PETN was taken as reference and tests were done using a slurry water gel, an emulsion, and a <b>gelatin</b> <b>dynamite.</b> The velocity profile of {{each one of these}} explosives was investigated to ensure the proper charge off-transient operation. The wrapping cartridge influence was studied. The fragment size distribution followed the Gates-Gaudin-Schumann model better than other available statistic models. The analysis showed that the rock fragmentation profile differs from that of the cast iron, suggesting the need of an improvement in the model calculation technique. However the test compares well with the qualitative performance of these commercial explosives in rock blasting. Pages: 308 - 31...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{is to show that}} the permissible explosive called 20 SR is able to pull out the coal in the normal conditions of blasting in a satisfactory way and to set up the equivalence between the 20 SR and <b>gelatin</b> <b>dynamite</b> (Goma 2 ECO). To achieve this goal some blasting were done, changing the conditions of the blasting and the powder factor for the 20 SR. To analyze the fragmentation base on the analysis of the images of the rock blasted, a commercial software was used. The results from this analysis were compared with the results from the theoretical model for fragmentation created by Kuz – Ram. After all, it was showed that the 20 SR explosive is able to pull out the coal for different coal rock compositions. As the result of this project we can conclude that the 20 SR seems to be able to pull out the coal in normal blasting conditions, using the powder factor as a proportion of the “ballistic mortar” between the two explosives...|$|E
40|$|A {{seismograph}} {{was used}} {{in a series of}} tests to measure the shockwaves produced in the snowpack from the detonation of explosives. Two different explosives commonly used in avalanche work were tested. Different shot placements in relation to the snow surface were compared, different types of snowpack were compared, and different size charges were compared. The results showed that a two pound cast Pentolite booster and a 3 x 8 cartridge of ammonia <b>gelatin</b> <b>dynamite</b> produced almost identical shockwaves. Air blasts were shown to produce slightly larger shockwaves than surface blasts. While buried shots produced much smaller shockwaves than air or surface blasts. A charge detonated 25 cm (10 inches) below the snow surface produced shockwaves of approximately half the amplitude of a surface or air blast. Ground waves were shown to be insignificant, even when charges were detonated on the ground surface. When comparing different snowpacks, the results show that shockwaves penetrate deeper with less attenuation into a harder snowpack, than they do into a softer less dense snowpack. When comparing different size charges, it was shown that doubling the shot size would approximately double the area that was affected by the shockwaves to the same degree...|$|E
40|$|Since 1988, {{there have}} been 17 {{documented}} incidents in the United States and Canada in which carbon monoxide (CO) is suspected to have migrated through ground strata into occupied enclosed spaces {{as a result of}} proximate trench blasting or surface mine blasting. These incidents resulted in 39 suspected or medically verified carbon monoxide poisonings and one fatality. To better understand the factors contributing to this hazard, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) carried out studies in a 12 -foot diameter sphere to identify key factors that may enhance the levels of CO associated with the detonation of several commercial trenching explosives. The gaseous detonation products from emulsions, a watergel, and ANFO blasting agents as well as <b>gelatin</b> <b>dynamite,</b> TNT, and Pentolite boosters were measured in an argon atmosphere and compared with those for the same explosives detonated in air. Test variables included explosive formulation, wrapper, aluminum addition, oxygen balance, and density. Major contributing factors to CO production, under these laboratory test conditions, are presented. The main finding is the high CO production associated with the lack of afterburning in an oxygen poor atmosphere. Fumes measurements are compared with the manufacturer 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s reported IME fume class and with the Federal Relative Toxicity Standard 30 CFR Part 15 in order to gain an understanding of the relative toxicity of some explosives used in trench blasting...|$|E
40|$|A Study on Ground Vibration Due to Rock Blasting at Metal Quarry Ground vibration, {{air blast}} and fly-rock are {{unavoidable}} {{environmental impacts of}} rock blasting. Despite these, blasting is the widely accepted method of rock breaking in quarrying industry because of cost effectiveness, higher efficiency, convenience and ability to break hard rock. Among the environmental impacts, ground vibration is the most critical since it can cause damages to nearby structures. This study was carried out to compare vertical and horizontal bench blast(s) at a granitic gneiss rock quarry located in Colombo, Sri Lanka and predict the resulting peak particle velocities of ground vibration levels. To achieve these objectives, particle velocities and frequencies of 38 and 35 blasts respectively were measured in three perpendicular directions for horizontal and vertical bench blast(s) {{with the use of}} Instantel Blastmate II seismographs. In the blast(s), Ammonium Nitrate (ANFO) (blasting agent) primed by a <b>Gelatin</b> <b>Dynamite</b> primer were electrically initiated. Scaled distance parameters (Maximum charge weight per delay and distance between blasting points to monitoring location) were also recorded. The extensively used equation for seismic law of propagation, proposed by Devine (1962) and Devine and Duvall (1963), was used for the prediction of peak particle velocities. Points were plotted with Peak Particle Velocity (PPV) in Y- axis against Scaled Distance (D/Q 0. 5) in X- axis. Regression analysis was performed to define the line of best fit. At the end of statistical analysis, an empirical relationship with good correlation was established for prediction of peak particle velocity. Frequency analysis was also done for dominant frequency and zero crossing frequency to identify the effect of frequency of ground vibration to structural damages and identifying the most suitable type of frequency analysis to define the single frequency value for ground vibration. The established relationship, frequency analysis and result obtained are presented...|$|E
