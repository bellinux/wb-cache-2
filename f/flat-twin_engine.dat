25|$|The Zephyr was {{the first}} of three light {{aircraft}} designed and built by the Aero Club of the RAE. It was designed by Samuel Childs. As the Club originally considered it as an entrant to the Lympne Motor Glider Competition where the Daily Mail prize of £1000 for a 50-mile flight was limited to aircraft with engines of less than 750 cc capacity, it was fitted with a 600 cc Douglas <b>flat-twin</b> <b>engine</b> that produced only about 20hp (15kW).|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Army {{also asked}} Harley-Davidson {{to produce a}} new {{motorcycle}} {{with many of the}} features of BMW's side-valve and shaft-driven R71. Harley largely copied the BMW engine and drive train and produced the shaft-driven 750cc 1942 Harley-Davidson XA. This shared no dimensions, no parts and no design concepts (except side valves) with any prior Harley-Davidson engine. Due to the superior cooling of the <b>flat-twin</b> <b>engine</b> with the cylinders across the frame, Harley's XA cylinder heads ran 100°F (56°C) cooler than its V-twins. The XA never entered full production: the motorcycle by that time had been eclipsed by the Jeep as the Army's general purpose vehicle, and the WLA—already in production—was sufficient for its limited police, escort, and courier roles. Only 1,000 were made and the XA never went into full production. It remains the only shaft-driven Harley-Davidson ever made.|$|E

50|$|Another {{disadvantage}} of this layout {{is that the}} engine has to be high enough in the frame to provide the cylinder heads with banking clearance in turns, which raises the <b>flat-twin</b> <b>engine's</b> otherwise low center of gravity.|$|R

Maytag began manufacturing the Model 72 engine in 1937 and, after a break in production from May 1942 to June 1945 due to World War II, continued manufacturing them until the 1950s. Production ended some time between 1952 and 1960.|$|R

50|$|Early <b>flat-twin</b> motorcycles' <b>engines</b> were {{mounted with}} the {{cylinders}} {{in line with}} the frame. This caused uneven cooling of the cylinders and required the motorcycle to have a long wheelbase. Later <b>flat-twin</b> motorcycles' <b>engines</b> were mounted with their cylinders across the frame for better air cooling and a shorter wheelbase. Disadvantages of this layout include torque reaction in the motorcycle in turns and the potential to damage cylinder heads.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, {{motorcycle}} manufacturer Douglas built generators {{powered by}} their <b>flat-twin</b> <b>engines,</b> Norman Engineering Company produced flat twin generators from 1932 to 1968, and Enfield Industrial Engines (part of Enfield Cycle Company) produced 250 cc and 350 cc flat twin 2-stroke petrol stationary engines {{during the war}} which were used for generators and other military uses. After the war they built <b>flat-twin</b> air-cooled diesel <b>engines,</b> with applications ranging from farm use to marine use. Coventry-Victor introduced a diesel version of their existing 688 cc petrol flat-twin in 1932, {{and went on to}} produce flat-twin diesel and petrol engines for a variety of industrial and marine uses well into the post-war period.|$|R
50|$|The {{first known}} {{automotive}} application of toothed belts to drive overhead camshafts was with Devin-Panhard racing specials built by Bill Devin for the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) H-modified racing series. Some of these specials were powered by engines built from the crankcases of Panhard <b>flat-twin</b> <b>engines</b> and the cylinders of Norton motorcycles. The overhead camshafts on the Norton cylinders were driven by toothed belts from the Gilmer Belt Company {{instead of the}} tower shafts used in the Norton engines. Jimmy Orr won the 1956 SCCA H-modified championship in an overhead camshaft Devin-Panhard.|$|R

5000|$|The {{traditional}} crank configuration {{used with}} <b>flat-twin</b> <b>engines</b> is the boxer twin whose 180° crankshaft moves the pistons in phase with each other. In this configuration, the primary force generated by one piston counteracts that {{generated by the}} other at all times, resulting in excellent primary balance. Since the pistons are not in line with each other, the equal and opposing forces generate a rocking couple on the crankshaft. [...] Unlike the ignition of a V-twin or a 180° parallel twin, a boxer engine has equally spaced firing intervals, adding to its smoothness.|$|R
