5|$|Mikawa's {{run down}} the Slot was not {{detected}} by Allied forces. Turner had requested that U.S. Admiral John S. McCain, Sr., commander of Allied air forces for the South Pacific area, conduct extra reconnaissance missions over the Slot in the afternoon of August 8. But, for unexplained reasons, McCain did not order the missions, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> Turner {{that they were not}} carried out. Thus, Turner mistakenly believed that the Slot was under Allied observation throughout the day.|$|E
500|$|Garfield's biographers {{were unwilling}} to {{exonerate}} him in Crédit Mobilier, with Allan Peskin writing, [...] "Did Garfield lie? Not exactly. <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> the truth? Not completely. Was he corrupted? Not really. Even Garfield's enemies never claimed that his involvement... influenced his behavior." [...] Rutkow wrote that [...] "Garfield's real offense was that he knowingly denied to the House investigating committee that he had agreed to accept the stock {{and that he had}} also received a dividend of $329." [...] Caldwell suggested that Garfield [...] "...while he told the truth , certainly failed to tell the whole truth, clearly evading an answer to certain vital questions and thus giving the impression of worse faults than those of which he was guilty." [...] That Crédit Mobilier was a corrupt organization had been a secret badly kept, even mentioned on the floor of Congress, and editor Sam Bowles wrote at the time that Garfield, in his positions on committees dealing with finance, [...] "...had no more right to be ignorant in a matter of such grave importance as this, than the sentinel has to snore on his post." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{was arrested}} in Pakistan in October 2001 while {{traveling}} by bus to Karachi, Pakistan. The bus was stopped by local police who arrested Habib and two Germans. The two German citizens were released shortly thereafter. The Four Corners program stated that the two Germans were asked whether they had seen Habib, and whether he had told them {{that he had been}} in Afghanistan. They said nothing that incriminated Habib; one replied; [...] "No. I didn't see him in the camps I was in. Nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> us that he had been in a training camp." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bede {{tells us}} that Owin was working outside the oratory at Lichfield. Inside, Chad studied alone because the other monks were at worship in the church. Suddenly Owin {{heard the sound of}} joyful singing, coming from heaven, at first to the south-east, but {{gradually}} coming closer until it filled the roof of the oratory itself. Then there was silence for half an hour, followed by the same singing going back the way it had come. Owin at first did nothing, but about an hour later Chad called him in and told him to fetch the seven brothers from the church. Chad gave his final address to the brothers, urging them to keep the monastic discipline they had learnt. Only after this <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> them that he knew his own death was near, speaking of death as [...] "that friendly guest who is used to visiting the brethren". He asked them to pray, then blessed and dismissed them. The brothers left, sad and downcast.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1961 Stevenson {{suffered}} the greatest humiliation of his diplomatic {{career in the}} Bay of Pigs invasion. After hearing rumors that [...] "a lot of refugees {{wanted to go back}} and overthrow Castro", Stevenson voiced his skepticism about an invasion, but [...] "he was kept on the fringes of the operation, receiving...nine days before the invasion, only an unduly vague briefing by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr." [...] and the CIA. [...] Senior CIA official Tracy Barnes told Stevenson and his staff that [...] "there {{was going to be a}} clandestine operation in Cuba...it was strictly a Cuban affair. It would have some American cooperation, but only with the training and financing." [...] According to historian Peter Wyden, Barnes did not tell Stevenson that there would be a large-scale invasion of Cuba, nor did he provide details about the full extent of American support for, and involvement with, the Cuban rebels, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> Stevenson about the planned air strikes to destroy Castro's air force. Assistant Secretary of State Harlan Cleveland, who attended the briefing, felt that Barnes was [...] "too evasive", that he had been sent to reassure Stevenson that Kennedy [...] "knew what he was doing", and that [...] "evidently Stevenson was not to be told" [...] the full details of the invasion plan. Historian Garry Wills has written that [...] "news of the invasion was leaking out...Castro knew the landings would occur; only Adlai Stevenson was kept in the dark" [...] about the invasion by President Kennedy and his aides. Kennedy, anticipating that Stevenson might be angered at being left out of the discussions over whether to invade Cuba, told Schlesinger that [...] "the integrity and credibility of Adlai Stevenson constitute one of our great national assets. I don't want to do anything to jeopardize that", and he asked Schlesinger to let Stevenson know that the president was shielding him from many of the details to protect him in case the clandestine operation failed. Instead, as Robert Dallek has written, [...] "by leaving him out of the discussion it led to his humiliation." [...] Unaware that the anti-Castro Cuban exiles landing at the Bay of Pigs were being armed and assisted directly by the CIA and US Navy, and that American pilots were participating in bombing raids of Cuban targets, Stevenson unwittingly [...] "repeated a CIA cover story in a speech before the UN General Assembly." [...] He argued that the rebels were not assisted in any way by the U.S. government; when this claim was proven to be false Stevenson complained that [...] "I took this job on the understanding that I would be consulted and kept fully informed on everything. Now my credibility has been compromised and therefore my usefulness." [...] When he told his friend Harlan Cleveland that his own government had [...] "deliberately tricked" [...] him into believing there was no direct American involvement in the invasion, Cleveland replied [...] "I feel as betrayed as you do." [...] Stevenson seriously considered resigning, but was convinced by his friends and President Kennedy to stay.|$|E

6000|$|If {{you have}} ever done {{the same sort of}} thing {{yourself}} you will understand and feel for me. If you have not, you will very likely say, [...] "Disgusting old man! why <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> us this?" [...] The reason why is now to come.|$|R
