50|$|While the {{majority}} of {{studies have been conducted}} with youth same-sex friendships, others have explored co-rumination and correlates of co-rumination within other types of relationships. Research on co-rumination in the workplace has shown that discussions about workplace problems have led to mixed results, especially regarding gender differences. In high abusive supervision settings, the effects of co-rumination were shown to intensify its negative effects for women, while associating lower negative effects for men. In low abusive supervision settings, results show that there were no significant effects for women, but had negative outcomes for men. The study suggests the reason men are at risk for job dissatisfaction and depression in low stress supervision, is due to the gender differences at an early age. At a young age, girls report to co-ruminate more than boys, and as they age girls' scores tend to rise, while boys' scores tend to <b>drop.</b> <b>The</b> <b>study</b> further suggests that in adulthood, men have less experience with co-rumination than women, however some men may learn skills through interacting with women or the interaction style with other men in adulthood has changed from activity-based to conversation-based; suggesting that not only do men and women co-ruminate differently, but that the level of stress may be a factor as well. In another study, co-rumination was seen to increase the negative effects of burnout on perceived stress among co-workers, thereby indicating that, while co-rumination may be seen as a socially-supportive interaction, it could have negative psychological outcomes for co-workers.|$|E

The study is motivated {{by the need to}} design an adequate mixing chamber for aqueous chemical reactants in a micro steam generator. The study focuses on the geometric optimization of a static micromixer channel by considering the trade-off between mixing quality and pressure drop. Both zigzag and straight channels are evaluated, in addition to channels with differing amounts of added obstruction features. Due to computational limits, the numerical analysis is conducted in two dimensions.

Bed of biomass in the reactor resulted pressure drop causes the increase of energy for supplying gasifying agent, thereby reducing the net energy gain.

40|$|Coal {{gasification}} produces residual {{particles of}} coal char, coal ash, and sorbent that are {{suspended in the}} fuel gas stream exiting the gasifier. In most cases, these particles (referred to, hereafter, simply as char) must {{be removed from the}} stream prior to sending the gas to a turbine, fuel cell, or other downstream device. Currently, the most common approach to cleaning the gas stream at high temperature and pressure is by filtering the particulate with a porous ceramic or metal filter. However, because these dusts frequently have small size distributions, irregular morphology, and high specific surface areas, they can have very high gas flow resistance resulting in hot-gas filter system operating problems. Typical of gasification chars, the hot-gas filter dustcakes produced at the Power Systems Development Facility (PSDF) during recent coal gasification tests have had very high flow resistance (Martin et al, 2002). The filter system has been able to successfully operate, but pressure drops have been high and filter cleaning must occur very frequently. In anticipation of this problem, a study was conducted to investigate ways of reducing dustcake pressure drop. This paper will discuss the efficacy of adding low-flow-resistance particulate matter to the high-flow-resistance char dustcake to reduce dustcake pressure <b>drop.</b> <b>The</b> <b>study</b> had two parts: a laboratory screening study and confirming field measurements at the PSDF...|$|E

40|$|The {{conversion}} {{of natural gas}} to synthesis gas {{is a very important}} process because synthesis gas is necessary for the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and also for the production of methanol. The most common process for producing synthesis gas from natural gas is the steam reforming of methane, since methane is the main component of natural gas. Recently, a significant amount of effort has been directed to processes alternative to steam reforming of methane such as CO 2 reforming, catalytic and not catalytic partial oxidation of methane, e. t. c. Among the above mentioned processes partial oxidation of methane seems to be the most attractive alternative to steam reforming of methane for converting natural gas to synthesis gas, owing to a number of advantages. The most important among them are, the small amount of heat that is produced during the reaction compared to the heat that is produced during the combustion of methane to CO 2 and H 2 O, and the ratio of the produced synthesis gas which is CO/H 2 : ½ which is exactly the necessary ratio for the Fischer Tropsch and methanol synthesis. The catalytic partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas has been studied using fixed bed reactors, mainly. Due το the disadvantages of this kind of reactors such as the development of hot spots during the combustion of methane and the high pressure <b>drop,</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> of partial oxidation of methane has been made in other kind of reactors such as fluidized bed reactors, honeycomb reactors, auto-thermal reactors, e. t. c. In the present study the catalytic partial oxidation of methane has been studied in a Heat Integrated Wall Reactor (HIWAR) and also in a monolithic reactor. The Heat Integrated Wall Reactor consists of a non-porous ceramic tube of high thermal conductivity in the inner and outer surface of which the catalytic film is deposited. The tube is enclosed in another tube, which can be ceramic or quartz. Because of the way of construction of the reactor the catalyst that is deposited in the inner surface of the ceramic tube can be different from the one that is deposited on the outer surface of the tube. The catalyst that was used {{for the study of the}} partial oxidation to synthesis gas in the Heat Integrated Wall Reactor was Rh/Al 2 O 3. The factors the influence of which was studied here were the type of deposition of the catalyst film on the tube, the furnace temperature, the flow rate and the amount of catalyst that was deposited in the inner and outer surface of the tube. The experimental results indicated that there is an optimum amount of catalyst that can be deposited on the inner and outer surface of the reactor in order to obtain a flat temperature profile without the development of hot spots. The range of flow rates that can be used in the HIWAR is bigger than the range that can be used in a conventional reactor, due to the absence of hot spots. Some experimental results also indicated that part of CO is produced via the direct scheme. Partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas had been studied in a monolithic reactor as well. The main advantages of monolithic reactors are the very low pressure drop and the high surface area. The catalyst that was used during this study was 0. 5 %Ru/TiO 2 (1 %CaO), which is a very active and stable catalyst for this reaction. During the experiments that took place in the monolithic reactor the factors the influence of which was studied here were the flow rate, the furnace temperature and the feed composition. The experimental results indicated that the combustion of methane takes place initially which is followed by the endothermic reforming reactions. The combustion of methane to CO 2 and H 2 O is favored in low temperatures while the endothermic reforming reaction is favored in high temperatures. Methane conversion as well as CO and H 2 selectivity change as the flow rate and furnace temperatures change. Experimental results indicated that a catalyst grain diameter less than 0, 09 mm is necessary for the catalyst to be stable during the reaction. In order to predict the behavior of factors such as temperature, methane conversion and CO and H 2 selectivity during the catalytic partial oxidation of methane in a monolithic reactor, a one-dimensional model was developed in order to simulate the monolithic reactor during the reaction. The calculations were based on the rate equations that were developed using experimental results for the 0, 5 %Ru/TiO 2 (1 %CaO). The influence of the initial temperature, initial pressure, flow rate and feed composition were studied. Comparison of the results of the simulations against those of the experimental studies indicated that calculations qualitatively predict the behavior of the reactor but not quantitatively, probably due to the assumptions that were introduced during the development of the model, i. e. one dimensionality of the model, uncertainties in the rate expressions etc. Relaxing some of those assumptions in order to approach the real operating conditions of the reactor is expected to enhance quantitative agreement between the experimental and numerical results. ...|$|E

It was found that the presence of the rod generates waves shortly downstream, from which drops detach, and reduces the mixture velocity for the transition from stratified to non-stratified flows. The average interface height and wave amplitude increase with distance from the rod, while the average wave length and frequency remain almost constant.
