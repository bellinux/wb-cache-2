40|$|Objetivos: Descrever e analisar as manifestações clínicas da síndrome de Usher bem como, estudar o padrão hereditário da doença nos pacientes examinados. Métodos: Foram estudados quatro pacientes, com diagnóstico de síndrome de Usher, na clínica oftalmológica de um {{hospital}} geral universitário, no período de dezembro de 1997 a março de 1999. Os pacientes foram submetidos a exames de acuidade visual, refração, biomicroscopia, oftalmoscopias direta e indireta, tonometria, retinografia, campo visual com perímetro de Goldman e audiometria. Foi desenhado o heredograma da família e realizado anamnese e oftalmoscopia binocular indireta de 63 familiares. Resultados: Dos quatro pacientes com síndrome de Usher, 1 foi do tipo I e 3 do tipo II. A acuidade visual dos pacientes variou de 20 / 100 a 20 / 400 e a disacusia de moderada a grave. Todos apresentaram retinose pigmentar típica e campo visual tubular. Não foram detectados outros casos de associação de retinose pigmentar e surdez dentre os familiares examinados. Conclusão: É importante enfatizar ao oftalmologista, o diagnóstico de síndrome de Usher, diante de um caso de retinose pigmentar, chamando atenção para o seu padrão de herança autossômica recessiva, assim como para a orientação ao paciente sobre as manifestações clínicas da doença e importância do acompanhamento oftalmo-otorrinolaringológico. Purpose: To {{describe and}} analyze the clinical manifestation of Usher's syndrome and to study their hereditary standard as well. Methods: Four patients with Usher's syndrome were studied at Ophthalmologic Clinic of the Getúlio Vargas Hospital, in Teresina-PI, between December, 1997 and March, 1999. The patients were scheduled for tests of visual acuity, refraction, biomicroscopy, direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy, tonometry, retinography, visual field with Goldman perimeter and audiometry. Family's pedigree was built and an anamnesis and indirect binocular ophthalmoscopy of 63 (sixty-three) relatives were performed.

40|$|O HINT - Brasil (Hearing in Noise Test, versão em português do Brasil) é um teste de reconhecimento de fala em ruído, que simula situações auditivas assemelhadas às do dia-a- dia. Acrescentado à rotina audiológica nacional, constitui uma importante ferramenta diagnóstica, para avaliar as incapacidades auditivas de portadores de disacusias sensorioneurais em frequências altas, de grande prevalência em nosso meio. A pesquisa objetiva avaliar o desempenho do teste, com e sem ruído competidor, em normo-ouvintes e usuários de aparelhos de amplificação sonora {{individual}} (AASI). O teste HINT contém 12 listas de 20 sentenças cada, totalizando 240 sentenças representativas da fala cotidiana, curtas, fonemicamente balanceadas, de fácil compreensão e com o mesmo grau de dificuldade. Os sujeitos foram divididos em: Grupo 1, composto por 30 sujeitos com audição normal e média de idade de 31, 2 anos (dp 8, 0) submetidos ao teste com fones de ouvidos e em campo livre, em quatro condições: com som frontal e sem ruído; com som frontal e ruído frontal, ruído à direita e ruído à esquerda e Grupo 2, composto por 30 sujeitos com perda auditiva sensorioneural, usuários de AASI bilaterais com média de idade de 71, 6 anos (dp 14, 7) submetidos ao teste em campo livre nas quatro condições. Com fones de ouvidos, as médias dos resultados apresentaram-se semelhantes aos de outros estudos, em diversos idiomas, inclusive o português do Brasil: 26, 3 dB com som frontal (SRT- sem ruído); relações sinal/ruído (S/R) de - 5, 1 dB com ruído frontal, - 11, 9 dB com ruído à direita; - 12, 1 dB com ruído à esquerda. Em campo livre: 13, 5 dB com som frontal (SRT); - 3, 5 com ruído frontal, 6, 5 dB com ruído à direita; - 8, 0 com ruído à esquerda. Para o Grupo 2 os valores em campo livre, sem AASI foram: 55, 8 dB com som frontal (SRT- Sem ruído); relações sinal/ruído (S/R) de 3, 5 dB com ruído frontal, 2, 2 dB com ruído à direita; 0, 4 dB com ruído à esquerda. Com o uso de seus AASI os valores passaram a ser 36, 5 dB com som frontal (SRT- Sem ruído); relações S/R de 1, 5 dB com ruído frontal, 0, 9 dB com ruído à direita; - 1, 1 dB com ruído à esquerda. Em campo livre, os normo-ouvintes apresentaram melhor desempenho nos testes sem ruído e maior dificuldade com ruído, em relação aos testes com fones de ouvidos. O Grupo 2, com o uso de AASI apresentou valores de relação S/R entre - 2 a 0 dB de ganho. Na falta de parâmetros nacionais para testes em campo livre os valores médios presentes são sugeridos como referências para futuras comparações. O HINT Brasil mostrou-se um teste eficiente para analisar dificuldades de entendimento de fala em situação de escuta cotidiana. The HINT - Brazil (Hearing in Noise Test, {{version in}} Brazilian Portuguese) {{is a test}} of recognition of speech in noise, which simulates resembled auditory situations to the ones of day-by-day. Added to the national audiological routine, it constitutes an important diagnostic tool to evaluate the hearing impairment of individuals with sensorineural <b>dysacusis</b> in high frequencies, of great prevalence in our environment. The research aims to evaluate {{the performance of the}} test with and without competitive noise, in normal-hearing individuals and users of hearing aids. Test HINT contains 12 lists of 20 sentences each, totalizing 240 sentences representative of daily speeches, short, phonemically balanced, of easy understanding and with the same level of difficulty. The individuals had been divided in: Group 1 composed of 30 individuals with normal hearing with average age of 31, 2 years (dp 8, 0) submitted to the test with earphones and free-field in four conditions: with frontal sound without noise; with frontal sound and frontal noise, noise to the right, and noise to the left and Group 2, composed of 30 individuals with sensorineural hearing loss, using bilateral hearing aids with average age of 71, 6 years (dp 14, 7) submitted to the free-field test in the four situations. With earphones, the averages of the results showed similar results to other studies in several languages, including Brazilian Portuguese: 26, 3 dB with frontal sound (SRT); signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of - 5, 1 dB with frontal noise, - 11, 9 dB with noise to the right; - 12, 1 dB with noise to the left. In free-field: 13, 5 dB with frontal sound (SRT); - 3, 5 with frontal noise, - 6, 5 dB with noise to the right; - 8, 0 with noise to the left. The results in freefield to Group 2 without hearing aids: 55, 8 dB with frontal sound without noise; 3, 5 dB with frontal sound and frontal noise, 2, 2 dB noise to the right, and 0, 4 dB noise to the left. With the use of its hearing aids: 36, 5 dB dB with frontal sound without noise; 1, 5 dB with frontal sound and frontal noise, 0, 9 dB noise to the right, and - 1, 1 dB noise to the left. In free field, the normal-listeners presented better performance in the tests without noise and greater difficulty with noise, compared to the tests with earphones. The Group 2, when used of its hearing aids presented values signal-to-noise ratio between - 2 and 0 dB of profit. In the lack of national parameters for tests in free-field the current average values are suggested as references for future comparisons.
