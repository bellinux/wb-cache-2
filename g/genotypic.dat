5|$|Standard {{errors of}} prediction, {{also known as}} {{accuracy}} or possible change value {{in the context of}} EBV and EPD predictions, are dependent on the quality of information used to predict an animal's EBV or EPD for a given trait. Errors in estimating genetic merit are being addressed in research programmes that aim to supplement phenotypic data extensively used in current BLUP predictions with <b>genotypic</b> data.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} organism's phenotype {{results from}} both its genotype {{and the influence}} from the environment it has lived in. A substantial part of the phenotypic variation in a population is caused by <b>genotypic</b> variation. The modern evolutionary synthesis defines evolution as the change over time in this genetic variation. The frequency of one particular allele will become more or less prevalent relative {{to other forms of}} that gene. Variation disappears when a new allele reaches the point of fixation—when it either disappears from the population or replaces the ancestral allele entirely.|$|E
5|$|Mycena aurantiomarginata uses a tetrapolar mating system, whereby genes at two {{different}} locations on the chromosomes regulate sexual compatibility, or mating type. This system prevents self-fertilization and ensures {{a high degree}} of <b>genotypic</b> diversity. When the fungal mycelia is grown in culture on a petri dish, the colonies are white, odorless, and typically have a central patch of congested aerial hyphae that grow upward from the colony surface, which abruptly become flattened to submerged, and occasionally form faint zone lines. The hyphae commonly form deposits of tiny amorphous crystals where they contact other mycelial fronts, especially where the hyphae are vegetatively incompatible and destroy each other by lysis.|$|E
5|$|The {{complete}} set of observable traits {{that make up the}} structure and behaviour of an organism is called its phenotype. These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment. As a result, many aspects of an organism's phenotype are not inherited. For example, suntanned skin comes from the interaction between a person's genotype and sunlight; thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children. However, some people tan more easily than others, due to differences in <b>genotypic</b> variation; a striking example are people with the inherited trait of albinism, who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to sunburn.|$|E
5|$|While natural {{selection}} has a direction, guiding evolution towards heritable adaptations {{to the current}} environment, genetic drift has no direction and is guided only by the mathematics of chance. As a result, drift acts upon the <b>genotypic</b> frequencies within a population without regard to their phenotypic effects. In contrast, selection favors the spread of alleles whose phenotypic effects increase survival and/or reproduction of their carriers, lowers the frequencies of alleles that cause unfavorable traits, and ignores those that are neutral.|$|E
5|$|Overall, the {{evidence}} {{provided by the}} embryo suggests that Dinocephalosaurus was viviparous, making it the first viviparous archosauromorph asides from possibly metriorhynchids. This {{is consistent with the}} separation of its sacral ribs from its sacrum, which indicates a mobile pelvis that could have functioned in giving birth. While the otherwise absence of viviparous archosaurs has been historically attributed to common attributes inherited from the archosaurian stem-lineage, the discovery that Dinocephalosaurus was viviparous suggests that this phenomenon is due to lineage-specific lifestyle restrictions. Although the sex-determination systems among living archosauromorphs are diverse, with crocodilians and turtles using temperature-dependent sex determination, phylogenetic modelling suggests that Dinocephalosaurus retained the basal condition of <b>genotypic</b> sex determination from early diapsids, and that this system facilitated its transition to an obligately marine lifestyle alongside viviparity.|$|E
5|$|Variation and Evolution in Plants was {{the first}} book to provide a wide-ranging {{explanation}} of how evolutionary mechanisms operated in plants at the genetic level. It brought concepts related to plant evolution into line with animal evolution as it emerged from Dobzhansky's 1937 Genetics and the Origin of Species and provided the conceptual framework to organize a disparate set of disciplines into a new field: plant evolutionary biology. In the book Stebbins argued that evolution needed to be studied as a dynamic problem and that evolution must be considered on three levels: first, that of individual variation within an interbreeding population; second, that of the distribution and frequency of this variation; and third, that of the separation and divergence of populations {{as the result of}} the building up of isolating mechanisms leading to the formation of species. He used the work of biosystematists Clausen, Keck, Hiesey, and Turesson to show that it was possible to distinguish between <b>genotypic</b> and phenotypic variationthat is, genetically identical plants could have different phenotypes in different environments. One of the book's most original chapters used the cytogenetics work of C. D. Darlington to show that genetic systems like hybridization and polyploidy were also subject to selection.|$|E

25|$|The {{probiotic}} candidate {{must be a}} taxonomically defined microbe or {{combination of}} microbes (genus, species, and strain level). It is commonly admitted that most effects of probiotics are strain-specific and cannot be extended to other probiotics of the same genus or species. This calls for a precise identification of the strain, i.e. <b>genotypic</b> and phenotypic characterization of the tested microorganism.|$|E
25|$|The same markers in {{the gray}} short-tailed opossum (Monodelphis domestica), a marsupial, span 3.95 Mb, {{yielding}} 114 genes, 87 shared with humans. Marsupial MHC <b>genotypic</b> variation lies between eutherian mammals and birds, taken as minimal MHC encoding, but is closer in organization to that of nonmammals, and MHC class I genes of marsupials have amplified within the class II region, yielding a unique class I/II region.|$|E
25|$|An {{ultimate}} factor {{is one that}} explains long term evolutionary advantages of behavior in an organism. Proboscis extension response to different concentrations of sucrose is a <b>genotypic</b> trait; the genes vary {{with respect to the}} sucrose concentration level at which proboscis extension response is manifested. Natural selection is able to directly shift the set of foraging behaviors by operating on the distribution of these genes in the honey bee population.|$|E

The garden runs a series of winter {{hardiness}} trials on trees, shrubs, herbs, annuals and bulbs. The garden collection consists of Primula, Meconopsis, Allium Rosa (shrub), alpines, and herbs and plants traditionally used by Aboriginal Peoples. There is a microfungus collection and a herbarium that contains more than 4,800 livery <b>genotypic</b> filamentous fungi.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of the experiment, Lenski and his colleagues have {{reported}} a wide array of phenotypic and <b>genotypic</b> changes in the evolving populations. These have included changes that have occurred in all 12 populations and others that have only appeared in one or a few populations. For example, all 12 populations showed a similar pattern of rapid improvement in fitness that decelerated over time, faster growth rates, and increased cell size. Half of the populations have evolved defects in DNA repair that have caused mutator phenotypes marked by elevated mutation rates. The most striking adaptation reported so far is the evolution of aerobic growth on citrate, which is unusual in E. coli, in one population at some point between generations 31,000 and 31,500.|$|E
25|$|Lynn and Harvey {{have argued}} that the causes of the above are {{difficult}} to interpret since these countries have had significant recent immigration from countries with lower average national IQs. Nevertheless, they expect that similar patterns will occur, or have occurred, first in other developed nations and then in the developing world as {{there is a limit to}} how much environmental factors can improve intelligence. Furthermore, during the last century there is a negative correlation between fertility and intelligence although there is not yet any conclusive evidence of the association between the two. They estimate that there has been a dysgenic decline in the world's <b>genotypic</b> IQ (masked by the Flynn effect for the phenotype) of 0.86 IQ points per decade for the years 1950–2000.|$|E
25|$|Tissue {{samples from}} {{necrotic}} lesions are examined by microscopy. The presence of aseptate branched hyphae in tissue is {{a hallmark of}} mucormycosis. Normally, culture of material from a biopsied lesion is used to recover and identify members of the Mucorales although blood cultures are often negative for these fungi. Cultures may be sterile despite clearing visible fungi in histological preparations. This {{may be due to}} hyphae becoming damaged during biopsy or ground up during laboratory procedures making growth in culture very difficult. Unlike many members of the Mucorales, species of Apophysomyces are often slow to sporulate, further complicating rapid culture-based identification. Definitive identification of A. variabilis requires phenotypic and <b>genotypic</b> analysis. Most modern case reports of A. variabilis infection have confirmed identifications against known strains by sequence similarity.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{diversity}} within populations {{has been found}} to be much lower than the average for most woody plants. Additionally, the divergence between populations was found to be higher. There were large genetic differences between populations, indicating there is limited gene flow between populations. This is understandable due to the limited ecological niche beach vitex inhabits. Since the populations are largely clonal, this may enhance genetic drift. Significant variations have been observed with regard to genotype and chemotype of various beach vitex samples collected from across China. <b>Genotypic</b> and chemotypic variations were closely associated. Large genetic variation between populations was observed with lower variation within populations, and plants within 20 m of each other were closely related. It was believed that differentiation of separated populations might be the cause of variations between populations.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} blastocyst, this initial, {{imprinted}} X-inactivation is reversed in {{the cells of}} the inner cell mass (which give rise to the embryo), and in these cells both X chromosomes become active again. Each of these cells then independently and randomly inactivates one copy of the X chromosome. This inactivation event is irreversible during the lifetime of the cell, so all the descendants of a cell which inactivated a particular X chromosome will also inactivate that same chromosome. This phenomenon, which can be observed in the coloration of tortoiseshell cats when females are heterozygous for the X-linked gene, {{should not be confused with}} mosaicism, which is a term that specifically refers to differences in the genotype of various cell populations in the same individual; X-inactivation, which is an epigenetic change that results in a different phenotype, is not a change at the <b>genotypic</b> level. For an individual cell or lineage the inactivation is therefore skewed or 'non-random', and this can give rise to mild symptoms in female 'carriers' of X-linked genetic disorders.|$|E
25|$|Hypercycle theory {{proposed}} that hypercycles {{are not the}} final state of organization, and further development of more complicated systems is possible by enveloping the hypercycle {{in some kind of}} membrane. After evolution of compartments, a genome integration of the hypercycle can proceed by linking its members into a single chain, which forms a precursor of a genome. After that, the whole individualized and compartmentalized hypercycle can behave like a simple self-replicating entity. Compartmentalization provides some advantages for a system that has already established a linkage between units. Without compartments, genome integration would boost competition by limiting space and resources. Moreover, adaptive evolution requires the package of transmissible information for advantageous mutations in order not to aid less-efficient copies of the gene. The first advantage is that it maintains a high local concentration of molecules, which helps to locally increase the rate of synthesis. Secondly, it keeps the effect of mutations local, {{while at the same time}} affecting the whole compartment. This favours preservation of beneficial mutations, because it prevents them from spreading away. At the same time, harmful mutations cannot pollute the entire system if they are enclosed by the membrane. Instead, only the contaminated compartment is destroyed, without affecting other compartments. In that way, compartmentalization allows for selection for <b>genotypic</b> mutations. Thirdly, membranes protect against environmental factors because they constitute a barrier for high-weight molecules or UV irradiation. Finally, the membrane surface can work as a catalyst.|$|E
500|$|To {{sharpen the}} {{precision}} of description and classification Joachim Jung (1587–1657) compiled a much-needed botanical terminology which has {{stood the test of}} time. English botanist John Ray (1623–1705) built on Jung's work to establish the most elaborate and insightful classification system of the day. His observations started with the local plants of Cambridge where he lived, with the [...] (1860) which later expanded to his , essentially the first British Flora. Although his [...] (1682, 1688, 1704) provided a step towards a world Flora as he included more and more plants from his travels, first on the continent and then beyond. He extended Caesalpino's natural system with a more precise definition of the higher classification levels, deriving many modern families in the process, and asserted that all parts of plants were important in classification. He recognised that variation arises from both internal (<b>genotypic)</b> and external environmental (phenotypic) causes and that only the former was of taxonomic significance. He was also among the first experimental physiologists. The [...] can be regarded as the first botanical synthesis and textbook for modern botany. According to botanical historian Alan Morton, Ray [...] "influenced both the theory and the practice of botany more decisively than any other single person {{in the latter half of}} the seventeenth century". Ray's family system was later extended by Pierre Magnol (1638–1715) and Joseph de Tournefort (1656–1708), a student of Magnol, achieved notoriety for his botanical expeditions, his emphasis on floral characters in classification, and for reviving the idea of the genus as the basic unit of classification.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in the mid-1990s, Beutler {{attempted}} to positionally clone the mutation {{responsible for the}} common adult-onset form of hereditary hemochromatosis. [...] He failed to identify the mutation before it was found by others to affect HFE, {{a member of the}} major histocompatibility complex family of proteins. [...] However, in contrast to the reports of others, he found that only about 2% of males and no females homozygous for the mutation showed severe clinical manifestations of the disease. [...] This study depended upon <b>genotypic</b> and phenotypic analysis of more than 43,000 subjects.|$|E
2500|$|Within {{infected}} tissues, this yeast produces several enzymes such as proteinase, phospholipase, hyaluronidase and chondroitin-sulphatase. Proteinase and phospholipase [...] {{are also}} released in infections involving Candida albicans {{and have been}} found to contribute to its virulence by inducing pores into host cell membranes, which eventually lead to their loss of function. For this reason {{it has been suggested that}} these enzymes may also serve a function in the pathogenicity of M.pachydermatis. However, pathogenicity in this species has yet to be associated with any specific <b>genotypic</b> and phenotypic traits.|$|E
2500|$|Liver {{transplantation}} {{is unique}} in {{that the risk of}} chronic rejection also decreases over time, although the great majority of recipients need to take immunosuppressive medication {{for the rest of their}} lives. [...] It is possible to be slowly taken off anti rejection medication but only in certain cases. It is theorized that the liver may play a yet-unknown role in the maturation of certain cells pertaining to the immune system. There is at least one study by Thomas E. Starzl's team at the University of Pittsburgh which consisted of bone marrow biopsies taken from such patients which demonstrate <b>genotypic</b> chimerism in the bone marrow of liver transplant recipients.|$|E
2500|$|OXA beta-lactamases {{were long}} {{recognized}} as a less common but also plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase variety that could hydrolyze oxacillin and related anti-staphylococcal penicillins. These beta-lactamases differ from the TEM and SHV enzymes in that they belong to molecular class D and functional group 2d [...] The OXA-type beta-lactamases confer resistance to ampicillin and cephalothin and are characterized by their high hydrolytic activity against oxacillin and cloxacillin {{and the fact that}} they are poorly inhibited by clavulanic acid. Amino acid substitutions in OXA enzymes can also give the ESBL phenotype. While most ESBLs have been found in E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and other Enterobacteriaceae, the OXA-type ESBLs have been found mainly in P. aeruginosa. OXA-type ESBLs have been found mainly in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from Turkey and France. The OXA beta-lactamase family was originally created as a phenotypic rather than a <b>genotypic</b> group for a few beta-lactamases that had a specific hydrolysis profile. Therefore, there is as little as 20% sequence homology among some of the members of this family. However, recent additions to this family show some degree of homology to one or more of the existing members of the OXA beta-lactamase family. Some confer resistance predominantly to ceftazidime, but OXA-17 confers greater resistance to cefotaxime and cefepime than it does resistance to ceftazidime.|$|E
