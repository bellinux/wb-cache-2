[...] The rating of film later brought {{comparisons}} to Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut, released in theaters in a digitally altered and censored version {{just two weeks after}} South Park. Kubrick's original cut was given an NC-17 rating, but Warner Bros. then blocked out characters in an orgy scene so the film could be rated R. In response to these debates and controversy, Stone called the MPAA a [...] "bumbling, irresponsible organization".|$|E

This is, in a sense, pre-crime. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> what you're doing and you want to express yourself, the expression should be primary and any interpretations that come after must always remain of secondary importance {{to the creation of the}} work itself.

500|$|The {{ceremony}} was identified by some commentators as precipitating a new {{mood in the}} United Kingdom: it [...] "had barely finished before {{it had become a}} byword for a new approach, not only to British culture but to Britishness itself. Politicians would soon be referring to it, using it as shorthand for a new kind of patriotism that does not lament a vanished Britain but loves the country that has changed. Boyle's {{ceremony was}} hailed from (almost) all sides...for providing a nation that had grown used to mocking its myriad flaws with a new, unfamiliarly positive view of itself ... It was, perhaps, this lack of cynicism that people responded to ... So used to British irony and detachment, it felt refreshing to witness an unembarrassed, positive case for this country. Boyle himself says this {{was the most important thing}} he took away from the Olympic experience: [...] "How important it is to believe in something.

He subsequently abandoned his Christian beliefs. By the time he entered politics he was a self-described agnostic. Hawke told Andrew Denton in 2008 that his father's Christian faith had continued to influence his outlook, saying [...] "My father said <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> the fatherhood of God you must necessarily believe in the brotherhood of man, it follows necessarily, and even though I left the church and was not religious, that truth remained with me." ...|$|E

For example, hucksters {{are more likely to be}} successful if they exude an air of confidence ("If you look and act as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> what you are doing, you will be able to sell even a bad reading to most of your subjects"), if they [...] "ake creative use of the latest statistical abstracts, polls, and surveys" [...] showing [...] "what various subclasses of our society believe, do, want, worry about, and so on", if they employ [...] "a gimmick, such as a crystal ball, tarot cards, or palm reading", if they are alert to the clues provided about their clients by such details as their [...] "clothing, jewelry, mannerisms and speech", if they are not afraid of [...] "hamming it up", and if they use flattery.|$|E

2500|$|When people {{converse}} with one another, {{according to the}} American philosopher John Searle, they're making moves, not {{in the real world}} which other species inhabit, but in a shared virtual realm peculiar to ourselves. Unlike the deployment of muscular effort to move a physical object, the deployment of illocutionary force requires no physical effort (except movement of the tongue/mouth to produce speech) and produces no effect which any measuring device could detect. Instead, our action takes place on a quite different level— that of social reality. This kind of reality is in one sense hallucinatory, being a product of collective intentionality. It consists, not of [...] "brute facts"— facts which exist anyway, irrespective of anyone's belief— but of [...] "institutional facts", which [...] "exist" [...] only <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> them. Government, marriage, citizenship and money are examples of [...] "institutional facts". One can distinguish between [...] "brute" [...] facts and [...] "institutional" [...] ones by applying a simple test. Suppose no one believed in the fact— would it still be true? If the answer is [...] "yes", it's [...] "brute". If the answer is [...] "no", it's [...] "institutional".|$|E
2500|$|Dawkins expresses {{concern about}} {{increasing}} religious influence in British schools with over 7,000 faith schools already {{and the government}} encouraging more, so {{over half of the}} new City Academies are expected to be sponsored by religious organizations. He says that the most worrying development is a new wave of private Evangelical schools that have adopted [...] the American Baptist Accelerated Christian Education curriculum, and as an example calls on Phoenix Academy in London. Dawkins is shown around the school by head teacher Adrian Hawkes and remarks on how the teaching material appears to mention God or Jesus on almost every page; such as a reference to Noah's Ark in a science textbook. Hawkes responds by saying that the stories could {{have a lot to do}} with science <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> them, and that the science he was taught at school is laughable today. As an example, he mentions that he was taught that the moon came from the Earth's ocean and was [...] "somehow flung out into space" [...] during the early years of the Earth's life. Dawkins says that it should have been presented as a strong current theory. Another lesson talks about AIDS as being the [...] "wages of sin", so Dawkins inquires whether this might not be mixing health education with moralistic preaching. Hawkes responds that without a law-giver, [...] "Why is rape wrong? Why is pedophilia wrong?" [...] and that if people believe they can get away with committing bad deeds then they will tend to do them. Dawkins responds to this claim by asking Hawkes if the only reason he doesn't do these things is that he's frightened of God and subsequently suggests that this attitude is characteristic of the warped morality that religion tends to instill in people.|$|E
