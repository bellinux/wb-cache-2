Dahlgren (1985) suggested there were in fact forty – not one – families distributed over three orders (predominantly Liliales and Asparagales). In {{the context of a}} general review of the classification of angiosperms, the Liliaceae were subjected to more intense scrutiny. Considerable progress in plant phylogeny and phylogenetic theory enabled a phylogenetic tree to be constructed <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flowering plants, as elaborated by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (1998).|$|E
