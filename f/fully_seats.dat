50|$|As {{long as the}} hot-swap {{connector}} {{is sufficiently}} rigid, {{one of the four}} corner pins will always be the first to engage. For a typical two-row connector arrangement this provides four first-to-make corner pins that are usually used for grounds. Other pins near the corners can be used for functions that would also benefit from this effect, for example sensing when the connector is <b>fully</b> <b>seated.</b> This diagram illustrates good practice where the grounds are in the corners and the power pins are near the center. Two sense pins are located in opposite corners so that <b>fully</b> <b>seated</b> detection is confirmed only when both of them are in contact with the slot. The remaining pins are used for all the other data signals.|$|R
