40|$|The purpose {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the influence of leverage analysis on the company 2 ̆ 7 s financial performance, either simultaneously or partially. The leverage analysis will be illustrated by the <b>debt</b> ratio, <b>debt</b> <b>to</b> equity ratio and long-term <b>debt</b> <b>to</b> equity ratio, while the company 2 ̆ 7 s financial performance is measured by return on investment and return on equity.

Critics suggested darkly that he had never really intended to join the crusades, and was simply intending to profit from the crusading tithes.

Due to tax benefits, the use of financial leverage is considered. On the other hand, due to higher interest costs associated with obtaining debt, bankruptcy may also exist. In conclusion, this study examines the impact of capital structure tools on the return on equity, return on assets and return on working capital.
