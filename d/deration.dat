40|$|This aims to {{find the}} {{potentiality}} of introducing absorption chiller systems to improve the diesel power plant performance in Sri Lanka. The energy efficient operation of diesel power plants is very much important for the country due to {{the high cost of}} generation of thermal electricity. Therefore waste heat of diesel power plant is utilized to run a suitable absorption chiller. The considered waste heat is mainly of exhaust and cooling water in the diesel engines of the power plant. The performance of the power generating diesel engines is considered in two ways. That is in terms of specific fuel oil consumption (SFC) and engine <b>deration.</b> The SFC of the engines varies due to many factors. Since the site conditions in Sri Lanka are not in standard conditions the higher SFC and engine <b>deration</b> is possible. The ISO standard site conditions mean the 25 oC (77 oF) ambient temperature, 30 % relative humidity and a model was developed to evaluate the performance of particular engines. All the temperature values in the model are given in Fahrenheit degrees (oF). It is observed that the engine SFC is low and the engine will not derate at the standard site conditions. From the model it is obvious that when the ambient temperature is 70 oF (21. 1 oC) the engine will not derate due to the effect of humidity even though the percentage of relative humidity reaches 100. In contrast, above 133. 6 oF (56. 4 oC) ambient temperature the power plant diesel engines derate due to the effect of humidity irrespective of the value of percentage relative humidity. The investigated model was applied to evaluate the improved performance of a diesel power plant by introducing an absorption chiller system. The building cooling load was additionally integrated to that system. Therefore it further uplifts the advantages by saving electricity of vapour compression air conditioners...|$|E

The combination of journey planning applications and carbon calcul ators, allows for the provision of trip specific information regarding the potential environmental impact of personal transport options. While these applications are readily available in the market place, little in terms of scientific research has been und ertaken to examine their influence on users. This paper presents the results of a stated preference experiment examining influence of carbon dioxide emissions information on user mode choice, as part of a survey undertaken in the Greater Dublin Area in Nov ember 2012.

Drawing inspiration from the project “Mød Mig i Kulden”, which focuses on the enlightenment of young homeless people through a theater play, a street event and a photo exhibition, this project saw its origin. However this project rather focuses {{on the relationship between}} homeless people and other residents of Copenhagen with the main purpose of reducing the social gap between the two. After attending a guided tour led by Csaba Setet, a homeless man, the decision of using H. C. Ørstedsparken as the location for the execution of the event, Kreative Skygger, was taken, because of its site-specific qualities. The participatory approach to action research is used as the methodical approach in the phase prior to the execution of the event in the communication and negotiation with various partners to create an effect of empowerment, which leads to a shared sense of influence and thereby a neutral research process, least affected by existing power relations between us being the researchers and the observed research field being the various attendants at the event. Relevant theories on site-specific performance, rela- tional aesthetics, liminality and social art are examined to illustrate the problem, which, together with an analysis of Kreative Skygger based on observations made during the event, eventually leads to the conclusion: A micro-utopia was created by the use of thorough site-specific consi- <b>derations</b> and relational aesthetics with a constituted positive discourse, which allowed {{a positive}} social interaction between the homeless and other residents of Copenhagen...|$|R
40|$|Jiangnan is on {{the brink}} of revolution: a network of bullet train lines will re-territorilize this region of China, {{including}} Shanghai, drawing its 80 million inhabitants within a single hour’s commute of one another. From the train, the boundaries between Jiangnan’s ancient cities, villages, and countryside appear to dissolve into a momentary smear of colour. At the very moment the earth has shrunk by the bullet train, Jiangnan’s new mega-city status will erode a sense of community rooted in long stable demarcations of place. The humanity that endures will likely be atomized, lost in a vast, blurred, and indecipherable landscape that has sacrificed community for the high-speed design of a relentless modernity. Fuciao Cun Village, which stands at the geographic centre of Jiangnan, is being dismantled to accommodate explosive urban growth. Only the abandoned temple remains. The surviving temple is imagined to harbour three voices, each offering an alternate vision speed, space and time. Motionscapes studies the scene from the bullet train window {{and the power of the}} temple as a ruin, standing still in a landscape of radical flux. Waterland re-tools the temple site to choreograph new economies and transportation networks that respond and reveal a topography continuously animated by water. Finally, Maritime Theatre turns to classical Jiangnan gardens, cities, and temples for tactics of place-making. These techniques attempt to evoke collective memory to waken a dormant yet resilient zeitgeist at the uprooted site.

Therefore, there is always need for generator as back up or continuous use in our industries. Determination of capacity of generator to procure is always a problem. Some company by error purchased generators that cannot carry the load of their industries. This always led to load shed either on machines or the entire facilities they have. This {{is due to the fact}} that the capacity of the generator required was not predetermined and also the expansion of the companies in the nearest future was not considered.

40|$|The noise {{seen by the}} {{front-end}} {{readout electronics}} of silicon microstrip detectors depends on the capacitive load on each channel and the shot noise due to the reverse current in the detector. Because of the short integration time of the LHC electronics (25 ns), the shot noise contribution is negligible {{as long as the}} current is kept to an acceptable level. However, any inter-strip capacitance increase after irradiation will degrade the noise performances of the detectors. A dependence of the capacitance on the crystal orientation of the silicon crystal used as a substrate for silicon detectors has been recently reported (Feld L., et al., Radiation induced changes in the Interstrip Capacitance of Silicon Microstrip Detectors, 4 th ROSE Workshop on Radiation Hardening of Silicon Detectors, CERN 2 - 4 December 1998, Published in CERN/LEB 98 - 11 (697)).

A strong dependence of the inter- strip capacitance on the bias applied to the detector has been found for the irradiated detectors made on silicon, but this dependence decreases with the frequency of the measurement. At high frequencies, which are the only ones relevant for the noise behaviour of the detectors, we found no differences at high bias voltages between the values before and after irradiation for detectors made on silicon with different crystal orientations.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study comprised of 196 dry adult femora from 98 right and 98 left sides irrespective of sex and age b elonging to Andhra Pradesh population of India. The bone collections {{were obtained from the}} Anatomy department, Narayana medical college, Nellore, India. The femurs were kept in normal anatomical position on OB. The photographs were taken from the distal e nd of all the femurs placing the camera lens 10 cm constantly away from it with a digital camera. Using the reference points, angle between APA - TEA, APA - PCA and TEA - PCA were identified. The statistical significance of difference between the right and left g roups was evaluated by using Student paired t - test. Data were presented as mean±SD. P - value less than 0. 05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS : The {{relationship of the}} angle between the APA - TEA, APA - PCA and TEA - PCA were observed. The angle o f AP - TE, AP - PC and TE - PC was 94. 84 ± 3. 43 °, 87. 64 ± 1. 62 ° and 6. 84 ± 2. 71 ° respectively on right side.

The {{performance}} of a centrifugal pump is altered for slurry or viscous materials (Stepanoff, 1969) and {{this needs to be}} accounted for. Usually, the suitable selection and evaluation of centrifugal pumps is based only on water pump performance curves supplied by the pump manufacturer (Wilson, Addie, Sellgren & Clift, 1997). In 1984 Walker and Goulas conducted a number of pump performance tests with kaolin clay slurries and coal slurries on a Warman 4 / 3 AH horizontal slurry pump and a Hazleton 3 -inch B CTL horizontal pump (Walker and Goulas, 1984). Walker and Goulas have analysed the test data and correlated the performance derating both at the best efficiency flow rate (BEP) and at 10 % of the best efficiency flow rate (0. 1 BEP) to the modified pump Reynolds number (NRep). They have noticed that the head and the efficiency reduction ratio decreased for the pump Reynolds number less then 10 ⁶. Furthermore, Walker and Goulas obtained a reasonably good agreement (± 5 %) between pump test data for non-Newtonian materials and pump performance prediction using the Hydraulics Institute chart. Sery and Slatter (2002) have investigated pump <b>deration</b> for non-Newtonian yield pseudoplastic materials. The NRep was calculated using the Bingham plastic viscosity (µp). Results have shown good agreement with regard to head and efficiency reduction ratios in comparison with previous work. However, Sery and Slatter's pump performance correlation using the HI chart did not reach the same conclusion. Error margin of ± 20 % and ± 10 % were found for head and efficiency respectively. This study is an attempt to reconcile the differences between Walker and Goulas (1984) and Sery and Slatter (2002) and extend the evaluation of these derating methods to pseudoplastic materials. The test work was conducted in the Flow Process Research Centre laboratory of the Cape Peninsula University of Technology using two centrifugal pumps; a Warman 6 / 4 and a GrW 4 / 3. The materials used were water, CMC solution bentonite and kaolin suspension at different concentrations (7 % and 9 % by weight for bentonite; 5 %, 6 % and 7 % by weight for CMC; 17 %, 19 % and 21 % by volume for kaolin) ...|$|E
