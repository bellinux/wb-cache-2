Jerry and George asks him about the statue, but Ray gets offended and leaves when he hears their opinion.

Without notifying anybody, Kramer dresses up in Irving's old clothes and goes to Ray's apartment, pretending to be a cop, and recovers the statue, despite Ray's protests. Kramer returns the statue to a grateful George. But while George is holding the statue, Kramer gives him a friendly pat on the back, causing George to drop the statue, which breaks when it <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> The episode ends without ever revealing whether or not Ray had in fact stolen the statue from Jerry's apartment.|$|E

2500|$|The album {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 46, based on nine reviews, which indicates [...] "mixed or average reviews". Stephen Thomas Erlewine, {{editor at the}} music website AllMusic, gave a mixed review for the album, commenting that [...] "Lopez was never, ever about singing" [...] and referring to the album as [...] "high-sheen wallpaper, so flimsy that it peels away immediately after application." [...] Adam Markovitz from Entertainment Weekly commented that [...] "despite the star power she emits on screen, her vocals have always been less than stellar" [...] and that she [...] "often sounds limited and nasal, with a flatness that can feel downright Rebecca Black-esque at its worst." [...] However, Ian Drew from US Magazine awarded the album three out of five stars, praising Lopez for returning [...] "to her dance-diva-from-the-block roots." [...] In his review, Drew concluded that [...] "all in all, {{when it comes to}} her day job, J. Lo is solidly still in business." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave the album three out of five stars, saying that: [...] "Love? isn't the all-out dance album it could—and should—have been." [...] Cinquemani also saw that: [...] "the album's urban-leaning midtempo tracks feel oddly dated, like leftovers from an album recorded in a pre-Gaga world." [...] Hermione Hoby from The Observer gave the album a mixed review, saying that Lopez [...] "ends her four-year recording hiatus with a load of turbo-produced bangers." [...] However, Hoby was not impressed with the lyrics, commenting that they let the album down. [...] "The only thing impeding dancefloor abandon is the hilarity of the record's lyrics." [...] Alex Macpherson from BBC Music gave a favorable review for the album. He said that Lopez [...] "possesses both a lightness of touch and the effortless confidence of one of nature's own divas, which means that whenever she <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> to essay up-tempo swagger tracks she convinces without being as overbearing." [...] MacPherson also felt that [...] "Love? seeks to showcase her vulnerability and depth of feeling." [...] The Los Angeles Times was critical of the album, rating it one-and-a-half out of four stars, and referring to it as [...] "a limp, personality-free dance-pop collection with plenty of A-list collaborations (Tricky Stewart, RedOne, Lady Gaga) but none of the lightweight charm she once brought in hits like 'Waiting for Tonight' and 'Jenny from the Block'." [...] Jody Rosen from Rolling Stone rated it two stars out of five and said that: [...] "Love? arrives with shiny production credits, but it's undone by J.Lo's slight voice and slighter personality." [...] Robert Copsey from the entertainment website Digital Spy gave a more favorable review for the album, rating it three stars and stating that: [...] "As a comeback album, Love? does the job perfectly– hauling an almost-forgotten Lopez back into chart relevance with a collection of calculated, safe and bang-on-trend tunes that were constructed for radio and clubs alike." [...] At USA Today, Elysa Gardner rated it two stars out of four, writing that the release [...] "suffers from such a lack of personality." ...|$|E
