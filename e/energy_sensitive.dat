40|$|Aiming for a {{more benign}} {{approach}} to manufacturing, new technological and logistical approaches to <b>energy</b> <b>sensitive</b> production control have been developed. However, practical experience shows that these are or will usually not be implemented due to unclear or conflicting objectives from the technical and the economic side. A prominent example for this is buffers within production systems. While these should be avoided or at least minimised in order to decrease costs and investments, they may allow for the temporary transfer of production equipment into less energy consuming operation states. This paper reports on joint efforts to reduce interface issues by integrating technical and economic decision making into a consistent procedural framework.

'Geothermal Energy' among the renewable energy sources in our country is known as an important type of valid and potential energy sources. Design and land-use are {{closely linked to the}} energy efficiency levels for an urban area. The current urban planning practice does not involve an effective landuse-energy evaluation in its 'blueprint' urban plans. The case of Balçova, a district in the Izmir Metropolitan area, is used conformingly for evaluating the proposed master plan and the 'geothermal energy district heating system' use for the concern district. The examination of the existing development plan with an. <b>energy</b> <b>sensitive.</b> point of view, determination of the questioning criteria's, and the evaluation of alternative compromises that can be done on planning principles, form the originality of thesis. The construction is completed by the integration of these policy-planproject scaled approaches during this evaluation. According to the thesis main idea, the proposed <b>energy</b> <b>sensitive</b> land-use planning method can be an effective tool for planners as simulation media in GIS programs using, to evaluate efficiency levels for different plan proposals, letting to know how much energy saving causes how much deviation from the other planning ideals.

Although WMSN is developed from WSN, its energy limitation is even more severe than that of WSN due to the high quantities of data that are included in multimedia content. Different from WSN, the energy consumption in WMSN is not mainly consumed in communication. Sometimes, sensing and processing multimedia data in WMSN may consume more energy than transmitting the same data. Hence, it is not adoptable in WMSN to simply ignore these two kinds of energy consumption like WSN does. Moreover, the multimedia sensor nodes are deployed in sparseness for their strong directives and far-field of view, which results in the big difference of network coverage model between the WMSN and WSN. This difference will also affect the network topology structure and the increased distance results in the energy consumption increased dramatically.|$|E
