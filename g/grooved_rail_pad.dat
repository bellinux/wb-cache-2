40|$|Impact loads {{applied to}} {{concrete}} sleepers, either {{due to the}} wheel flats of a train or rail abnormalities, may cause the sleepers to crack. The <b>rail</b> <b>pads</b> {{have been used to}} attenuate the effect of these impact loads on concrete sleepers and on the substructures in ballasted railway tracks. The <b>rail</b> <b>pads</b> experience high intensity loads due to wheel impacts and, as a result, the pad properties deteriorate during the service life. The consequences can be significant for the dynamic behaviour of railway tracks, interaction of vehicle and track, and impact forces on track components. However, there is currently no standard method available {{that can be used to}} evaluate the dynamic characteristics of the pads. In this paper, the degradation of <b>rail</b> <b>pad</b> properties as a function of their in-service life is studied with a view of developing a technique for predicting the optimum period of track maintenance with regard to pad replacement. Identification of structural properties using methods of experimental modal analysis provides a means for investigation of the deterioration of dynamic pad characteristics. A technique using an instrumented impact hammer is employed in this study. The pad samples were collected from the railway lines in Sydney Electrified Network, Australia, which are operated by Rail Corporation New South Wales (RailCorp). Through testing of pads in a recently developed <b>rail</b> <b>pad</b> testing machine, the vibration responses were measured in the frequency range from 0 to 1000 Hz using the Bruel 2 ̆ 6 Kjaer PULSE Vibration Analyser system. The analytical solution was derived to estimate the dynamic stiffness and damping constants of the worn pads from the obtained experimental data. The rates of deterioration based on limited data are proposed to predict the useful lifetime of pads and the period of pad replacement. In this study, the type of <b>rail</b> <b>pad</b> used was the high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pad with 5. 5 mm thickness. All worn pads were sourced from RailCorp tracks with approximately 22 MGT (million gross tons) annual tonnage. Based on linear regression analysis, it has been determined that at 20 kN preload (equivalent to PANDROL e-Clip fastening system clamping force) degradation of dynamic stiffness and damping is about 2. 2 MN/m and 19. 6 Ns/m per MGT, respectively, for the particular track conditions...|$|R
40|$|Wheel/track impact due to {{rail joints}} or wheel flats {{has been studied}} over many years. The railway track is usually assumed to be linear {{in order to simplify}} the track model, {{although}} the <b>rail</b> <b>pad</b> and ballast are actually non-linear. This may cause incorrect results to some extent in some circumstances, as the pad and ballast stiffness varies with load. In this paper wheel/track impact is studied using a non-linear track model. The rail is represented by a finite element (FE) model and is supported by a non-linear track foundation. Wheel/track impacts are simulated at different train speeds and three types of <b>rail</b> <b>pad,</b> soft, medium and stiff, are used in the simulations. It is shown that the impact forces rise dramatically when the stiff <b>rail</b> <b>pads</b> are used. On the other hand, using soft pads can reduce impact forces significantly. Compared with the results from the linear track model, both the impact force and the track vibration level are shown to be noticeably higher from the nonlinear track than those from the linear track. It is therefore concluded that linear track models are not appropriate for wheel/track impact because the track foundation stiffness varies dramatically under the impact force...|$|R

In addition, an innovator technique allows deconstructing tire layers without grinding up the material, reducing production costs {{at the same time}} that tire properties are remained. This research is focused on the study of the viability of developing elastic components from used tire layers by evaluating the influence of thickness, the resistance capacity of the elements and their behavior in a ballast box.

40|$|A {{model for}} {{simulation}} of dynamic interaction between a railway vehicle and a turnout (switch and crossing, S&C) is validated versus field measurements. In particular, the implementation {{and accuracy of}} viscously damped track models with different complexities are assessed. The validation data come from full-scale field measurements of dynamic track stiffness and wheel-rail contact forces in a demonstrator turnout that was installed {{as part of the}} INNOTRACK project with funding from the European Union Sixth Framework Programme. Vertical track stiffness at nominal wheel loads, in the frequency range up to 20 Hz, was measured using a rolling stiffness measurement vehicle (RSMV). Vertical and lateral wheel-rail contact forces were measured by an instrumented wheel set mounted in a freight car featuring Y 25 bogies. The measurements were performed for traffic in both the through and diverging routes, and in the facing and trailing moves. The full set of test runs was repeated with different types of <b>rail</b> <b>pad</b> to investigate the influence of <b>rail</b> <b>pad</b> stiffness on track stiffness and contact forces. It is concluded that impact loads on the crossing can be reduced by using more resilient <b>rail</b> <b>pads.</b> To allow for vehicle dynamics simulations at low computational cost, the track models are discretised space-variant mass-spring-damper models that are moving with each wheel set of the vehicle model. Acceptable agreement between simulated and measured vertical contact forces at the crossing can be obtained when the standard GENSYS track model is extended with one ballast/subgrade mass under each rail. This model can be tuned to capture the large phase delay in dynamic track stiffness at low frequencies, as measured by the RSMV, while remaining sufficiently resilient at higher frequencies...|$|R
