5000|$|The growing {{community}} {{was given the}} name [...] "Butler" [...] in 1881 after Richard Butler, who had taken ownership of the <b>Hard</b> <b>Rubber</b> Company. A Post Office was established and a larger railroad station was built. This station has been the Borough Museum since about 1977. The <b>Hard</b> <b>Rubber</b> Company eventually merged with other businesses and became the American <b>Hard</b> <b>Rubber</b> Company in 1898. A [...] "Soft" [...] Rubber Company built a factory just along Main Street. The borough continued to grow as other factories and supporting businesses were established. The population in 1920 was 2,265 people. By 1950, it was 4,063.|$|R

5000|$|The sulfur {{percentage}} and {{the applied}} temperatures and duration during vulcanizing {{are the main}} variables that determine the technical properties of the <b>hard</b> <b>rubber</b> polysulfide elastomer. The occurring reaction is basically addition of sulfur at the double bonds, forming intramolecular ring structures, so {{a large portion of}} the sulfur is highly cross-linked in the form of intramolecular addition. As a result of having a maximum sulfur content up to 40%, it may be used to resist swelling and minimize dielectric loss. The strongest mechanical properties and greatest heat resistance is obtained with sulfur contents around 35% while the highest impact strength can be obtained with a lower sulfur content of 30%. The rigidity of <b>hard</b> <b>rubber</b> at room temperature is attributed to the van der Waals forces between the intramolecular sulfur atoms. Raising the temperature gradually increases the molecular vibrations that overcome the van der Waals forces making it elastic. <b>Hard</b> <b>rubber</b> has a content mixture dependent density around 1.1 to 1.2. When reheated <b>hard</b> <b>rubber</b> exhibits shape-memory effect and can be fairly easy reshaped within certain limits. Depending on the sulfur percentage <b>hard</b> <b>rubber</b> has a thermoplastic transition or softening temperature of [...]|$|R

5000|$|<b>Hard</b> <b>rubber</b> {{was used}} in the cases of {{automobile}} batteries for years, thus establishing black as their traditional colour even long after stronger modern plastics like polypropylene were substituted. It was used famously for many decades in hair combs made by Ace, now part of Newell Rubbermaid, although the current models are known to be produced solely with plastics. (An easy way to identify a <b>hard</b> <b>rubber</b> comb is to rub part of its surface vigorously, then immediately smell the comb. <b>Hard</b> <b>rubber's</b> scent, resulting from the sulfur in the ebonite, can usually be detected temporarily. The same effect can often be produced by running the comb under hot tap water.) ...|$|R

50|$|Clarinet and {{saxophone}} mouthpieces {{have been}} made out of <b>hard</b> (vulcanized) <b>rubber,</b> brass or other metal, crystal, glass, plastic, and wood. Today, the most common material for professional clarinet and (classical) saxophone mouthpieces is <b>hard</b> <b>rubber.</b> Jazz saxophone mouthpieces are made out of <b>hard</b> <b>rubber,</b> metal, or (rarely) wood. There is some debate over whether the material affects the tone, or whether tone is shaped only by the internal shape and dimensions of the mouthpiece. According to Larry Teal, the mouthpiece material has little, if any, effect on the sound, and the physical dimensions give a mouthpiece its tone colour.|$|R

Originally intended by Dr. Baekeland for a synthetic varnish, the new material was used by Seabury in making the world's first molding of organic plastics in 1907. Boontonware, a molded plastic dinnerware, was sold nationwide.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a stress {{analysis}} of <b>hard</b> <b>rubber</b> under large torsion deformations. This study was motivated by effort to find the dependency the dissipated energy on the deformation energy. Based {{on the results of}} an experiment, a function of dissipation energy of <b>hard</b> <b>rubbers</b> for finite strains using the theory hyperelasticity was proposed herein analogically as a proportional damping for elastic theory. Samples of <b>hard</b> <b>rubber</b> of different hardness (EPDM, Silicone) were dynamically tested on the developed torsional test-rig at different frequencies, amplitudes. First the Mooney Rivlin model (MRM) for a shear case of loading was analytically developed and then MRM constants were attained by fitting of the MRM to the experimental torsion-deformation curve. These constants were used to obtain the deformation energy of the MRM models. The coefficients of hyperelastic proportional damping relating a dissipated energy to a strain energy were evaluated for tested rubbers on the basis of experimental results...|$|R
