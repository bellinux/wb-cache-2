5000|$|A {{prominent}} {{example of}} medications targeted {{to a specific}} race {{is the case of}} Bidil. A group of 1050 African Americans with congestive heart failure participated in a 3-year study called African American Heart Failure Trial (A-HeFT),  in which they were treated with Bidil i.e. <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> <b>and</b> <b>hydralazine.</b> This was the first “racial drug” in medical practice.  [...] The control group was treated with their usual heart medications. The results showed that “BiDil users had a 43% better survival rate {{during the course of the}} study and were 39% less likely to need hospitalization for HF”.|$|E
5000|$|From 1980 to 1985 Dr. Jay Cohn of the University of Minnesota led a {{clinical}} trial {{in collaboration with the}} US Veterans Administration called the Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial (V-HeFT I) that tested whether the combination of <b>Isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> <b>and</b> <b>hydralazine</b> increased survival in patients with heart failure; the results were promising and the study was followed by V-HeFT II, which tested the combination against enalapril. [...] In the meantime, Cohn applied for a patent on the combination treatment, which issued in 1989 as US Patent 4868179. [...] Cohn licensed the patent to a company called Medco, and Medco spent the early 1990s preparing a New Drug Application (NDA) to get the FDA to approve BiDil {{on the basis of the}} V-HeFT trials. However, the trials were not designed to support an NDA, and in 1997 the FDA rejected the application because it did not have enough statistical power to show whether the combination really worked.|$|E
40|$|The 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association {{guidelines}} recommend combined <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> (ISDN) <b>and</b> <b>hydralazine</b> {{to reduce}} mortality and morbidity for African-Americans with symptomatic heart failure (HF) and reduced ejection fraction, currently receiving optimal medical therapy (class I, level A). Nitrates can alleviate HF symptoms, but continuous use {{is limited by}} tolerance. Hydralazine may mitigate nitrate tolerance, and the ISDN–hydralazine combination in the Vasodilators in Heart Failure Trial (V-HeFT) I improved survival and exercise tolerance in men with dilated cardiomyopathy or HF with reduced ejection fraction, most notably in self-identified black participants. In the subsequent V-HeFT II, survival was greater with enalapril than with ISDN–hydralazine in the overall cohort, but mortality rate was similar in the enalapril and ISDN–hydralazine groups in the self-identified black patients. Consequently, in the African-American Heart Failure Trial (A-HeFT) in self-identified black patients with symptomatic HF, adding a fixed-dose combination ISDN–hydralazine to modern guideline-based care improved outcomes versus placebo, including all-cause mortality, and led to early trial termination. Hypertension underlies HF, especially in African-Americans; the A-HeFT and its substudies demonstrated not only improvements in echocardiographic parameters, morbidity, and mortality but also a decrease in hospitalizations, potentially affecting burgeoning HF health-care costs. Genetic characteristics may, therefore, determine response to ISDN–hydralazine, and the Genetic Risk Assessment in Heart Failure substudy demonstrated important hypothesis-generating pharmacogenetic data...|$|R

40|$|Several {{reports have}} {{suggested}} that because <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> <b>and</b> <b>hydralazine</b> have different and additive haemodynamic effects at rest in patients with chronic heart failure, these agents should be administered in combination. Some studies, however, indicate thay they are effective individually as well. Since most patients with heart failure are symptomatic only with activity, we examined the haemodynamic effects of these drugs given individually and in combination, at rest and during upright bicycle exercise. As has been noted previously, at rest isosorbide significantly lowered both ventricular filling pressures and did not change cardiac output; hydralazine increased cardiac output and had only a slight effect on pulmonary capillary wedge pressure; combined treatment produced both beneficial effects. In contrast, during exercise isosorbide dinitrate also raised cardiac output while hydralazine more dramatically lowered the wedge pressure. Combined treatment produced significantly greater improvement in each haemodynamic index than either drug alone, with a resulting 54 per cent increase in exercise cardiac output, and a 33 per cent reduction in exercise wedge pressure. Maximal oxygen consumption increased acutely during combined treatment.

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} {{the effect of the}} aldosterone synthase promoter polymorphism on heart failure outcomes for subjects in the African American Heart Failure Trial (A-HeFT). BackgroundGenetic heterogeneity modulates clinical outcomes in subjects with heart failure (HF); however, little data exist in African American populations. A common polymorphism exists in the promoter region of the aldosterone synthase gene (CYP 11 B 2) at position − 344 (T/C). The − 344 C allele, associated with higher aldosterone synthase activity, has been linked to hypertension; however, its impact on outcomes in HF is unknown. MethodsA total of 354 subjects from A-HeFT participated in the GRAHF (Genetic Risk Assessment of Heart Failure in African Americans) substudy and were genotyped for the aldosterone synthase polymorphism. Patients were followed prospectively, and event-free survival (freedom from death and HF hospitalization) compared by CYP 11 B 2 genotype. ResultsOf the cohort, 218 patients were TT, 114 CT, and 22 patients were CC. Baseline etiology, blood pressure, and functional class were not significantly different among the 3 cohorts. The C allele was associated with significantly poorer HF hospitalization-free survival with the best survival among TT subjects, intermediate for heterozygotes, and the poorest for CC homozygotes (p = 0. 018), and a higher rate of death (% death TT/TC/CC = 1. 8 / 3. 5 / 18. 2, p = 0. 001). The TT genotype, more prevalent in blacks, was associated with greater impact of fixed combination of <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> <b>and</b> <b>hydralazine</b> on the primary composite end point (p = 0. 01). ConclusionsThe aldosterone synthase promoter − 344 C allele linked to higher aldosterone levels is associated with poorer event-free survival in blacks with HF.

These drugs act by different mechanisms. We aimed to compare the results of isoprenaline with <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate.</b> Methods <b>and</b> resultsWe studied 198 subjects referred for HUTT to our institute; those above the age of 35 years were not included in our study, because isoprenaline was not used commonly above this age; thus, only 90 subjects were analyzed. We found that <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> resulted in more HUTT-positive results than isoprenaline by absolute risk difference of 26 %; relative risk for positive isoprenaline was 60 %, confidence interval 0. 38 – 0. 93, and P value of 0. 03. There was no difference in frequency of types of responses, i. e. Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 between passive testing, <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate,</b> <b>and</b> isoprenaline, confidence interval 1. 53 – 2. 02, and P value 0. 71. Time to get positive response was highest for passive testing followed by ISO and ISDN; the mean was 16. 85 ± 7. 00 min, 9. 85 ± 5. 84 min, and 7. 00 ± 3. 35 min, respectively. Statistically, ISDN versus ISO time to get positive response was not significant; P value was 0. 074 and 95 % confidence interval was − 0. 28 to 5. 98. ConclusionsIsosorbide dinitrate yields more positive HUTT than isoprenaline. The frequencies of type of responses are not different between passive testing, <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate,</b> <b>and</b> isoprenaline. There is no difference in time taken for positive response between <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> <b>and</b> isoprenaline.

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} assess the effect of {{baseline}} systolic blood pressure (SBP) and changes in SBP {{on the effectiveness of}} treatment with fixed-dose combination of <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> <b>and</b> <b>hydralazine</b> (FDC I/H) in patients with heart failure (HF). BackgroundLow SBP is a risk factor for adverse outcomes in patients with HF. However, FDC I/H lowered SBP in the A-HeFT (African-American Heart Failure Trial) and yet prolonged survival. Whether blood pressure (BP) lowering is critical to the efficacy of FDC I/H and whether a low BP limits its effectiveness is unclear. MethodsThe effects of FDC I/H on SBP and on mortality and hospitalization were compared in patients with a low or high baseline SBP using multivariable Cox regression models. The interaction between the effect of treatment and baseline SBP was examined. ResultsMean ± SD baseline SBP in all of the patients was 126 ± 18 mm Hg. Patients with baseline SBP equal to or below the median (126 mm Hg) had features of more severe HF. Baseline SBP equal to or below the median was an independent risk factor for death (hazard ratio [HR] 2. 09; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 02 to 4. 29) or first hospitalization for HF (HR 1. 66; 95 % CI 1. 18 to 2. 34). The FDC I/H treatment reduced BP in patients with SBP above the median but not in patients with SBP below 126 mm Hg. The FDC I/H treatment was associated with a similar decrease in mortality or hospitalization for HF in patients with SBP below the median and above the median. The effects of FDC I/H on mortality alone were also similar. ConclusionsIn A-HeFT, patients with lower SBP had a greater risk but a similar relative benefit from the use of FDC I/H as those with higher SBP. The FDC I/H treatment did not reduce SBP in patients with low SBP. An asymptomatic low SBP should not be considered a contraindication to use of FDC I/H in patients with HF...|$|E

We designed these studies with the aim of designing a Phase II trial to evaluate the drugs’ efficacy in patients affected by Duchenne muscular dystrophy. For the first trial, ISOFEN 1, a single-dose, randomized-sequence, open-label, active control, three-treatment cross-over study, was aimed at comparing the pharmacokinetics of ibuprofen 200 mg <b>and</b> <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> 20 mg when given alone and concomitantly. The pharmacokinetics of ibuprofen given alone versus ibuprofen given concomitantly with <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> were similar, as documented by the lack of statistically significant differences in the main drug’s pharmacokinetic parameters (time to maximal concentration [Tmax], maximal concentration [Cmax], area under the curve [AUC] 0 –t, and AUC 0 –∞). Similarly, we found that the coadministration of ibuprofen did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate.</b> No issues of safety were detected. The second trial, ISOFEN 2, was a single-site, dose titration study that was designed to select the maximum tolerated dose for <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> when coadministered with ibuprofen. Eighteen out of the 19 enrolled subjects tolerated the treatment well, and they completed the study at the highest dose of <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> applied (80 mg/day). One subject voluntarily decided to reduce the dose of <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> from 80 mg to 60 mg. The treatment-related adverse events recorded during the study were, for the large majority, episodes of headache that remitted spontaneously in 0. 5 – 1 hour – a known side effect of <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate.</b> These studies demonstrate that the combination of <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> <b>and</b> ibuprofen does not lead to pharmacokinetic interactions between the two drugs; they also demonstrate that the combination of <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> <b>and</b> ibuprofen has optimal tolerability and safety profiles that are similar to those previously reported for <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> <b>and</b> ibuprofen given alone.

When a drug is given to an animal or a human being, it is absorbed, distributed through the body and eliminated by metabolism in the liver (or in othe...|$|R
30|$|A 74 -year-old {{woman who}} had three {{instances}} of in-stent stenosis at the left anterior descending artery (LAD) was referred for CABG treatment. Preoperative coronary angiography showed 90 % in-stent stenosis of the proximal LAD and 75 % stenosis of the diagonal branch. We performed a left internal thoracic artery (LITA)-LAD bypass and a right internal thoracic artery (RITA) diagonal branch bypass. After anastomosis, transit time flow measurement revealed poor blood flow of LITA-LAD bypass even after re-anastomosis. We performed coronary angiography and detected a vasospasm in the native coronary arteries, which was not relieved using conventional vasodilators (calcium channel blockers, <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate,</b> <b>and</b> nicorandil) However, {{we were able to}} relieve the coronary vasospasm by administering fasudil (a Rho kinase inhibitor) injection without causing systemic hypotension.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: In {{an effort}} to improve {{radiotherapy}} treatments, methods aimed at increasing the quantity of oxygen delivered to tumors were investigated. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of one nitric oxide (NO) donor (<b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate)</b> on pO 2 and blood flow in a murine tumor model. The effect was compared to carbogen, used as a reference treatment. Methods and Materials: Thirty-six liver tumors implanted in mouse thighs were imaged using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 4. 7 Tesla with dynamic Gd-DTPA and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast-enhanced imaging after administration of <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> or carbogen. The effect on the pO 2 was also tested by EPR oximetry (1. 1 GHz) on 52 mice. Results: A significant increase in MRI intensity was observed for both treatments in comparison with the control group. EPR oximetry showed a dose-dependant increase in tumor pO 2 for <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> (by 5. 9 mmHg at 0. 2 mg/kg) and a substantially greater change for carbogen breathing (by 23 mmHg). Conclusion: Both tumor blood flow and pO 2 were increased by <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> <b>and</b> carbogen. Carbogen is more efficient than <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> in increasing the BOLD image intensity, as well as the tumor pO 2, but as efficient as <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> in the Gd-DTPA contrast-enhanced imaging. We conclude that the effects of carbogen on improving tumor pO 2 involve both improved blood flow and improved hemoglobin oxygenation, whereas the effects of <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> are predominantly mediated by improved blood flow alone. © 200...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY The acute hemodynamic {{response}} to vasodilators {{in patients with}} chronic heart failure has been well characterized, but less {{is known about the}} long-term hemodynamic effects of vasodilator therapy. We measured hemodynamic variables at rest and during upright exercise in 11 patients during the initiation of therapy with oral <b>hydralazine</b> <b>and</b> sublingual <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> <b>and,</b> in eight of these, after 3 months of con-tinuous treatment. Marked initial increases in resting cardiac output and stroke volume and reductions in wedge pressure were sustained during chronic therapy. Similarly, the early improvement in exercise hemo-dynamic measurements persisted in most subjects. Exercise tolerance, quantified as the maximum duration of treadmill exercise, increased modestly (7. 7 2. 6 to 8. 9 ± 3. 3 minutes, 0. 05 < p < 0. 10) after several days on vasodilators and further (10. 2 ± 3. 7 minutes, p < 0. 01) during long-term treatment. The acute hemodynamic effects of vasodilator therapy at rest or during exercise did not correlate well with the changes in exercise tolerance. Our findings suggest that the combination of <b>hydralazine</b> <b>and</b> <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> improves cardiac perform-ance at rest and during exercise in patients with chronic heart failure and that this improvement persists dur-ing chronic therapy. In most patients, this hemodynamic improvement is accompanied by greater exercise tolerance...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} {{the state of}} knowledge in the evidence-based management of heart failure (HF) with medications. Diuretics were amongst the first therapies {{to be used in}} the treatment of HF. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are considered the first-line therapy in the management of HF with reduced left-ventricular systolic function. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are the most recent class of drugs to be shown to be of benefit in HF. β-Blockers are considered the greatest advance in the treatment of HF since ACE inhibitors and lead to a further substantial reduction in mortality and morbidity. The mechanisms of action, clinical benefits, adverse effects and interactions, and practical uses of these therapies are reported. In addition, the mechanisms of action, clinical benefits, adverse effects and interactions, and practical uses of aldosterone antagonists, <b>hydralazine</b> <b>and</b> <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate,</b> <b>and</b> cardiac glycosides are described. It also explores the HF with preserved ejection fraction and other pharmacological therapies. Despite the impressive therapeutic armamentarium, patients with HF continue to experience progressive symptoms and shorter life expectancy...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the possibility that}} high dosages (480 mg/d) of <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> might reduce the frequency of angina attacks in selected patients who had not responded to low dosages of the drug (40 mg/d), and that the patients could tolerate {{the high levels of}} medication and maintain their responsiveness over the long term. In the single-blind phases of this trial 24 patients with grade 3 stable angina pectoris were given a placebo for 4 weeks and then increasing doses of <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> for a further 6 weeks. The 19 patients who both responded to and tolerated high doses of the drug kept taking 480 mg/d for an average of 1 year. The average weekly rate of angina attacks fell by 74 %, from 6. 05 in the placebo phase to 1. 6 during long-term active treatment (p less than 0. 01). Nitroglycerin consumption decreased accordingly. The patients' assessments of their levels of activity and well-being and their angina thresholds showed improvement among most of them. The trend of angina frequency was stable in 12 cases, downward in 6 and upward in only 1 case. Exercise performance as evaluated by a graded treadmill test showed a small but nonsignificant improvement of 18 %. It was concluded that some patients who do not respond to the antianginal action of low-dosage <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> <b>and</b> cannot be given beta-blockers may respond to high dosages and tolerate them for over a year. <b>Isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> may be clinically useful in patients with coronary heart disease even though their exercise performance is not significantly improved...|$|R
40|$|The {{reproducibility}} and {{agreement of}} the estimates of stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) by transthoracic impedance cardiography (ZCG) and M-mode echocardiography (ECHO) were analyzed {{before and after the}} placebo-controlled administration of ascending doses of <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> <b>and</b> nicorandil in 12 healthy subjects. There was no biostatistical agreement between the two methods in estimating cardiovascular function either before or after dosing (ZCG estimated substantially larger SV, CO and lower TPR). But, ZCG and ECHO estimated about similar overall treatment related changes (across treatments and periods) and reached substantially better agreement when the values were expressed as ratio of the baseline before dosing. Such improvement did not occur when the data were expressed as arithmetic difference from baseline. In spite of the improvement of agreement by expressing the data as ratio of baseline, the coefficients of reproducibility between the two methods (circa 25 % of baseline) remained too large to judge the methods interchangeable...|$|R
40|$|A 71 -year old man {{suffered}} from chest pain on effort. He frequently experienced chest {{pain in the}} early morning while sleeping. During Holter monitor recording, he {{suffered from}} chest pain that ceased with sublingual administration of nitroglycerin. The recording showed horizontal type depression of the ST segment over 0. 2 mV of channel CM 5 during chest pain. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with vasospastic angina pectoris. Administration of <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> <b>and</b> extended-released nifedipine per os was started, and for a while,chest pain ceased. However, after about 1 month, chest pains reappeared during sleep and bathing. Isosorbide dinitrate- tape was added, but it was not effective in treating the chest pain. The β 1 selective adrenergic receptor stimulant, denopamine, was then administered to prevent angina attacks. In the following month, there was no chest pain. The medicines were discontinud 1 at a time in the order isosorbide dinitrate-tape, nifedipine, <b>and</b> <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate,</b> at intervals of 1 month. Although denopamine alone remained as a treatment, there were no angina attacks, and abnormal changes in the ST segment were not observed on Holter monitoring after 3 months of denopamine only. Denopamine alone was effective in the case of refractory vasospastic angina pectoris...|$|R
40|$|New {{organic nitrate}} esters, derived from {{structurally}} different (cyclo) aliphatic templates, were synthesized and pharmacologically investigated. Their in vitro vascular smooth muscle relaxing activities and, occasionally, in vivo haemodynamic profiles were studied and {{compared to those}} of the clinically important nitrates, glyceryl trinitrate, <b>isosorbide</b> <b>dinitrate</b> <b>and</b> isosorbide- 5 -mononitrate. A number of compounds appeared to be even more potent than glyceryl trinitrate. Qualitative structure-activity relationships within the series of new compounds are discussed. In flexible n-alkylene dinitrates, lipophilicity as well as chain length appears to affect in vitro activity. In semi-rigid cyclohexylene dinitrates, the number of atoms between and the configuration of the nitrate groups may play an important role. Finally, in cycloalkylene mononitrates neither the number of ring carbon atoms nor the lipophilicity clearly affects the in vitro activity. It is suggested that, apart from a limited involvement of compound lipophilicity, other factors such as differences in enzymatic conversion to a common putative bioactive species, nitric oxide, are responsible for the observed differences in activity. © 1995 Royal Dutch Association for Advancement of Pharmacy...|$|R
