50|$|These similar {{telephones}} {{were initially}} only loop disconnect types, when {{introduced in the}} early 1980s, but were later available in MF4 (touchtone) versions. They {{were among the first}} range of BT phones to be available for outright sale. A novel feature of these phones was that both the <b>dialing</b> <b>circuit</b> and the transmission circuit were on a single microchip. The one shown in the photograph is a 9003R manufactured in January 1984 and is loop disconnect. The Tremolo has squarer, flatter styling with a handle recess in the case, below the handset, by which it may be carried in use.|$|R
50|$|The IBM 7701 Magnetic Tape Transmission Terminal was a {{communications}} device announced by IBM in 1960. It {{was designed to}} transfer {{the contents of a}} reel of magnetic tape over a leased or <b>dial</b> telephone <b>circuit.</b>|$|R
5000|$|By 1935, {{message routing}} {{was the last}} great barrier to full automation. Large {{telegraphy}} providers began to develop systems that used telephone-like rotary dialling to connect teletypewriters. These machines were called [...] "Telex" [...] (TELegraph EXchange). Telex machines first performed rotary-telephone-style pulse <b>dialling</b> for <b>circuit</b> switching, and then sent data by ITA2. This [...] "type A" [...] Telex routing functionally automated message routing.|$|R
50|$|Telephone {{companies}} typically provide {{two types}} of <b>dial</b> tone switched <b>circuits</b> - ground start and loop start. Private branch exchanges (PBX) work best on ground start trunks because those trunks can give them an on hook signal allowing for timely clearing.|$|R
5000|$|Like other {{electrical}} appliances, telephones {{are bound}} by similar restrictions on Shabbat. Operating a telephone may involve separate prohibitions at each stage of the operation. Thus, removing a telephone from the receiver to produce a dial tone closes a circuit and makes a noise. <b>Dialing</b> closes more <b>circuits</b> and creates more noises. Speaking on the phone increases an existing current, but Shlomo Auerbach and many other authorities permit this. Hanging up the phone opens a circuit, which is a Biblical prohibition of [...] "destroying" [...] according to the Chazon Ish but a Rabbinic prohibition according to others.|$|R
50|$|Like a {{dial tone}} or busy signal, the SIT is an in-band signal {{intended}} both {{to be heard}} by the caller, and to be detected by automated dialing equipment to determine a call failed. In North America, the AT&T/Bellcore SIT standard allows the frequency and duration of the tones to vary slightly - making eight distinct messages specifically for automated equipment; indicating not only the call failed, but also the specific reason for the failure (e.g., disconnected number, busy <b>circuits,</b> <b>dialing</b> error, etc.). The equipment can then make an intelligent choice {{about what to do}} next. If the circuits were busy, calling back later makes sense; if the number was disconnected, then the calling back is futile. The eight SIT signals are defined below and accompanied by audio files.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{depicts the}} Advanced Communication Technology Satellite (ACTS) {{system as a}} global central office switch. The ground portion {{of the system is}} the {{collection}} of earth stations or T 1 -VSAT's (T 1 very small aperture terminals). The control software for the T 1 -VSAT's resides in a single CPU. The software consists of two modules, the modem manager and the call manager. The modem manager (MM) controls the RF modem portion of the T 1 -VSAT. It processes the orderwires from the satellite or from signaling generated by the call manager (CM). The CM controls the Recom Laboratories MSPs by receiving signaling messages from the stacked MSP shelves ro units and sending appropriate setup commands to them. There are two methods used to setup and process calls in the CM; first by <b>dialing</b> up a <b>circuit</b> using a standard telephone handset or, secondly by using an external processor connected to the CPU's second COM port, by sending and receiving signaling orderwires. It is the use of the external processor which permits the ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) Signaling Processor to implement ISDN calls. In August 1993, the initial testing of the ISDN Signaling Processor was carried out at ACTS System Test at Lockheed Marietta, Princeton, NJ using the spacecraft in its test configuration on the ground...|$|R
40|$|Remote observing {{is now the}} {{dominant}} mode of operation for both Keck telescopes and their associated instruments. Over 90 % of all Keck observations are carried out remotely from the Keck Headquarters in Waimea, Hawaii. The majority of Keck observers, however, are affiliated with research institutions located on the U. S. mainland, primarily in California. To observe with the Keck telescopes, most of these astronomers currently travel several thousand kilometers in order {{to sit in a}} Keck remote control room located tens of kilometers from the telescopes. Given recent improvements in network infrastructure and facilities, many of these observations can now be conducted directly from California. This report describes the operation of a Keck telescope remote observing facility located at the UCO/Lick Observatory headquarters on the Santa Cruz campus of the University of California (UCSC). This facility currently enables remote operation and engineering of Keck optical instruments via Internet- 2. The facility was initially located in temporary quarters and became operational on a trial basis in September 2001. In June 2002, the facility moved to permanent quarters and became fully operational in July 2002. We examine in detail issues of Internet network bandwidth and reliability, and describe the design, routing implementation, and operation of an automated fall-back network utilizing <b>dialed</b> ISDN telephone <b>circuits</b> and routers. This report also briefly describes the status of efforts to establish Keck remote observing facilities at other California sites, and how the fall-back network design could be expanded to support multiple sites.

40|$|The {{majority}} of people across the globe rely on telephony networks as their primary means of communication. As such, {{many of the most}} sensitive personal, corporate and government related communications pass through these systems every day. Unsurprisingly, such connections are subject {{to a wide range of}} attacks. Of increasing concern is the use of metadata contained in Call Detail Records (CDRs), which contain source, destination, start time and duration of a call. This information is potentially dangerous as the very act of two parties communicating can reveal significant details about their relationship and put them in the focus of targeted observation or surveillance, which is highly critical especially for journalists and activists. To address this problem, we develop the Phonion architecture to frustrate such attacks by separating call setup functions from call delivery. Specifically, Phonion allows users to preemptively establish call circuits across multiple providers and technologies before <b>dialing</b> into the <b>circuit</b> and does not require constant Internet connectivity. Since no single carrier can determine the ultimate destination of the call, it provides unlinkability for its users and helps them to avoid passive surveillance. We define and discuss a range of adversary classes and analyze why current obfuscation technologies fail to protect users against such metadata attacks. In our extensive evaluation we further analyze advanced anonymity technologies (e. g., VoIP over Tor), which do not preserve our functional requirements for high voice quality in the absence of constant broadband Internet connectivity and compatibility with landline and feature phones. Phonion is the first practical system to provide guarantees of unlinkable communication against a range of practical adversaries in telephony systems...|$|R
