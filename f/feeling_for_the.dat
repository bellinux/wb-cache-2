5|$|I can't complain...Exile {{brought out}} in me, in {{addition}} to a revulsion against violence and against depreciation of the human condition, a <b>feeling</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> universality of man. Exile lent me perspectives from which to know my own country from other people's point of view, and from which to live for the enormity of its misfortune.|$|E
5|$|Angelou later gained fame as {{an author}} and a poet, most notably her first autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. In her fourth autobiography, The Heart of a Woman, she downplays her singing career and assigns little {{importance}} to Miss Calypso. In 1995, the album was re-released as a CD {{during a period of}} customer interest in 1950s exotica. Its artistry was re-examined in light of Angelou's later fame; it was said to exemplify the calypso music of the period, spiced with a <b>feeling</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> tradition's roots.|$|E

5|$|A {{tattoo on}} his arm {{identifies}} Tom Nero, and the rope still around his neck shows his method of execution. The dissectors, their hearts hardened after years of working with cadavers, are shown {{to have as much}} <b>feeling</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> body as Nero had for his victims; his eye is put out just as his horse's was, and a dog feeds on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one {{of its kind in the}} first plate. Nero's face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is not realistic, Hogarth meant it to heighten the fear for the audience. Just as his murdered mistress's finger pointed to Nero's destiny in Cruelty in Perfection, in this print Nero's finger points to the boiled bones being prepared for display, indicating his ultimate fate.|$|E
5|$|She {{was elected}} a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1989. McClintock {{received}} the Benjamin Franklin Medal for Distinguished Achievement in the Sciences of the American Philosophical Society in 1993. She was awarded 14 Honorary Doctor of Science degrees and an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters. In 1986 she {{was inducted into}} the National Women's Hall of Fame. During her final years, McClintock led a more public life, especially after Evelyn Fox Keller's 1983 biography of her, A <b>Feeling</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Organism, brought McClintock's story to the public. She remained a regular presence in the Cold Spring Harbor community, and gave talks on mobile genetic elements and the history of genetics research for the benefit of junior scientists. An anthology of her 43 publications The Discovery and Characterization of Transposable Elements: The Collected Papers of Barbara McClintock was published in 1987.|$|E

25|$|This idea of {{a romantic}} {{universal}} poesy can be seen clearly in the romantic triad. This theoretical structure always shows its recipient that the described moment is exactly the moment (kairos) in which the future is decided. These frequently mentioned critical points correspond with the artist’s <b>feeling</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> present, which Novalis shares with many other contemporaries of his time. Thus a triadic structure {{can be found in}} most of his works. This means that there are three corresponding structural elements which are written differently concerning the content and the form.|$|E
25|$|My sister's {{disposition}} was not naturally gregarious; circumstances favoured and fostered her {{tendency to}} seclusion; except {{to go to}} church or take a walk on the hills, she rarely crossed the threshold of home. Though her <b>feeling</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> people round was benevolent, intercourse with them she never sought; nor, with very few exceptions, ever experienced. And yet she knew them: knew their ways, their language, their family histories; she could hear of them with interest, and talk of them with detail, minute, graphic, and accurate; but WITH them, she rarely exchanged a word.|$|E
25|$|Khazars were {{replaced}} by Kipchaks, Kimeks and Mongols, who founded the Golden Horde in the lower reaches of the Volga. Later their empire divided into the Khanate of Kazan and Khanate of Astrakhan, {{both of which were}} conquered by the Russians {{in the course of the}} 16th century Russo-Kazan Wars. The Russian people's deep <b>feeling</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Volga echoes in national culture and literature, starting from the 12th-century Lay of Igor's Campaign. The Volga Boatman's Song is one of many songs devoted to the national river of Russia.|$|E

25|$|In 1933, Brodovitch {{added the}} Design Laboratory to the classes he offered. It {{was meant to}} be a {{workshop}} for his advanced students who wanted to experiment with all aspects of design. Brodovitch shared the Bauhaus belief that you needed to educate the whole individual by directing his or her attention to a variety of modern solutions in their graphic projects. His course description for the Design Laboratory read: The aim of the course is to help the student to discover his individuality, crystallize his taste, and develop his <b>feeling</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> contemporary trend by stimulating his sense of invention and perfecting his technical ability. The course is conducted as an experimental laboratory, inspired by the ever-changing tempo of life, discovery of new techniques, new fields of operation...in close contact with current problems of leading magazines, department stores, advertising agencies and manufactures. Subjects include design, layout, type, poster, reportage, illustration, magazine make-up, package and product design, display, styling, art directing.|$|E
25|$|Fly rods are, {{in modern}} manufacture, almost always {{built out of}} carbon {{graphite}}. The graphite fibres are laid down in increasingly sophisticated patterns to keep the rod from flattening when stressed (usually referred to as hoop strength). The rod tapers {{from one end to}} the other and the degree of taper determines how much of the rod flexes when stressed. The larger amount of the rod that flexes the 'slower' the rod. Slower rods are easier to cast, create lighter presentations but create a wider loop on the forward cast that reduces casting distance and is subject to the effects of wind. Furthermore, the process of wrapping graphite fibre sheets to build a rod creates imperfections that result in rod twist during casting. Rod twist is minimized by orienting the rod guides along the side of the rod with the most 'give'. This is done by flexing the rod and <b>feeling</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> point of most give or by using computerized rod testing.|$|E
25|$|The {{harmonic}} {{movements of}} the dolphin kick and flutter kick are {{in contrast to the}} breaststroke whip kick, which really deserves the name kick. Scissor kick and frog kick are intermediate. Humans have strong muscles in the legs and would need swim fins (like a frog) to bring all their power into the water and stand with the sole of the feet on the water. Rather the leg grabs almost as much water as the foot and a small amount of water is accelerated to high kinetic energy, but not much impulse is transferred. The toes are bent, the feet point 45° outwards, the sole points backwards, to mimic a hydrofoil. While closing in a V shape to the rear a small “lifting” force can be felt. Unlike in the other kicks, the joints are moved into extrema. Before the kick the knee is maximally bent and the upper leg is rotating along its axis to its extreme outer position and the lower leg is twisted to extreme, {{at the end of the}} kick the ankles are maximally turned to the inside so that the soles clap together to achieve a nozzle effect like in a jelly fish. Therefore, training involves getting flexible in addition to fitness and precision. The sudden sideways stress on knee at the kick can lead to uncomfortable noise and <b>feeling</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> beginner and to wear for the senior.|$|E

It is clear that he has <b>feelings</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> mysterious woman but can't express how he feels. The next scene shows him talking to an imam about his <b>feelings</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> woman, and he further pursues her despite knowing that she is already married. He then goes to his mosque and also to a {{therapist}} and asks for advice on what to do about his life.|$|R

500|$|The semiotician and essayist, Umberto Eco, in his 1979 {{examination}} of the Bond books, [...] "The Narrative Structure of Ian Fleming", considered that Fleming [...] "has a rhythm, a polish, a certain sensuous feeling for words. That {{is not to say}} that Fleming is an artist; yet he writes with art." [...] When examining the passage relating to the death of Le Chiffre, Eco wrote that [...] "there is a... baroque <b>feeling</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> image, a total adaptation off the image without emotional comment, and a use of words that designate things with accuracy", and he went on to conclude that [...] "Fleming is more literate than he gives one to understand." ...|$|E
500|$|Bizet's early one-act opera Le docteur Miracle {{provides}} the first clear signs of his promise in this genre, its sparkling music including, according to Dean, [...] "many happy touches of parody, scoring and comic characterisation". Newman perceives evidence of Bizet's later achievements {{in many of}} his earliest works: [...] "gain and again we light upon some touch or other in them that only a musician with a dramatic root of the matter in him could have achieved." [...] Until Carmen, however, Bizet was not essentially an innovator in the musical theatre. He wrote most of his operas in the traditions of Italian and French opera established by such as Donizetti, Rossini, Berlioz, Gounod, and Thomas. Macdonald suggests that, technically, he surpassed all of these, with a <b>feeling</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> human voice that compares with that of Mozart.|$|E
