25|$|Perhaps {{the first}} major act of symphonic/progressive was Crucis. Their music began {{attracting}} attention in the underground, and so they started <b>getting</b> <b>bigger</b> performing venues. As change swept Argentine rock in 1975, their music was rapidly rising to popular musical tastes. Their compositions were strong and dynamic with surprising breaks, and the interplay between the electric guitar (often spectacular wah-wah) and keyboards captivating. The rhythm-section sounded powerful and adventurous.|$|E

Frank Sinatra, Jr., who was present during the recording, noted the [...] "huge orchestra", which Nancy Sinatra stated [...] "opened a whole new era" [...] in pop music, with orchestras <b>getting</b> <b>bigger,</b> embracing a [...] "lush string sound". Sinatra and Count Basie collaborated for the album [...] the same year, a popular and successful release which prompted them to rejoin two years later for the follow-up It Might as Well Be Swing, arranged by Quincy Jones. [...] The two became frequent performers together, and appeared at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1965. Also in 1962, as the owner of his own record label, Sinatra was able to step on the podium as conductor again, releasing his third instrumental album Frank Sinatra Conducts Music from Pictures and Plays.|$|E

I know it's a very young age, but turning thirty marks when your twenties are over and you could start considering, 'Wow, {{one of these days}} I'm actually going to die.'" [...] While his parents overcame cancer, he began to focus on the concept of a young man saving a loved one from a life-threatening disease. He shared the concept with Handel, his undergraduate school roommate at Harvard University. Handel earned a Ph.D in neuroscience from New York University but was uncertain about a future in neuroscience. He recalled the discussion, [...] "Darren and I just started talking about the story.

[...] The Star-Ledgers Alan Sepinwall wrote, [...] "The extended, enormous job audition gave the writers a chance to reinvigorate the show and fully embrace Laurie's comic genius". Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times, on the other hand, took issue with the developments: [...] "the cast just kept <b>getting</b> <b>bigger,</b> the stories more scattered and uneven until you had a bunch of great actors forced to stand around watching Hugh Laurie hold the show together by the sheer force of his will". USA Todays Robert Bianco cheered the season finale: [...] "Talk about saving the best for last. With two fabulous, heartbreaking hours... the writers rescued a season that had seemed diffuse, overcrowded and perhaps too ambitious for its own good." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{opening track}} [...] "Playa Playa" [...] {{features}} basketball metaphors and gospel overtones, which accompany the track's slow funk and jazz vibe. On his bass {{playing in the}} song, Pino Palladino recalled [...] "I was thinking about Stevie Wonder in the choruses and P-Funk in the verses". Rob Evanoff of All About Jazz called the song [...] "an uplifting soul ride", and stated that it evokes an image of [...] "a musical train seen far off in the distance, slowly <b>getting</b> <b>bigger</b> as it gets closer". Evanoff also compared the track's style to the jam-sound of Pink Floyd, and wrote [...] "it surrounds you with a deep thick infectious groove that, at first, shadows and then envelopes your senses {{in such a way}} that is equal bits liberating, intoxicating and hypnotic…you close your eyes and are transported into another dimension". On the song's lyrics, one critic wrote that [...] "D'Angelo disses all neo-soul wannabes by calmly singing 'Bring the drama playa/Give me all U got'". [...] "Devil's Pie" [...] is a funk and hip hop diatribe with a lyrical theme concerning hip hop excess, and it is accompanied by P-Funk style harmonies and low-key singing by D'Angelo. It is a bass-driven track produced by DJ Premier, who contributes to its hip hop texture. The song's theme also incorporates religious imagery into its message of social strife. Questlove has stated that [...] "Devil's Pie" [...] was written to address the issues of [...] "the money hungry jiggafied state of the world we're in".|$|E

Immaculately edited, each traumatic, tensely tactile fight would blur into chaos if not for Evans's pinpoint pacing something that refreshes all the more in the face of modern blockbusting's tendency to start big and just keep <b>getting</b> <b>bigger,</b> until burnout." ...|$|E
