60|$|<b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>study</b> we have noted: (1) the Augustan or Classic Age; {{the meaning}} of Classicism; the life and work of Alexander Pope, the {{greatest}} poet of the age; of Jonathan Swift, the satirist; of Joseph Addison, the essayist; of Richard Steele, who was the original genius of the Tatler and the Spectator; of Samuel Johnson, who {{for nearly half a}} century was the dictator of English letters; of James Boswell, who gave us the immortal Life of Johnson; of Edmund Burke, the greatest of English orators; and of Edward Gibbon, the historian, famous for his Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.|$|E

60|$|<b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>study</b> we have noted: (1) the Revival of Learning, what it was, and the {{significance}} of the terms Humanism and Renaissance; (2) three influential literary works,--Erasmus's Praise of Folly, More's Utopia, and Tyndale's translation of the New Testament; (3) Wyatt and Surrey, and the so-called courtly makers or poets; (4) Malory's Morte d'Arthur, a collection of the Arthurian legends in English prose. The Miracle and Mystery Plays were the most popular form of entertainment in this age; but we have reserved them for special study in connection with the Rise of the Drama, in the following chapter.|$|E
60|$|<b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>study</b> we {{have noted}} (1) the Transition Poets, of whom Daniel is chief; (2) the Song Writers, Campion and Breton; (3) the Spenserian Poets, Wither and Giles Fletcher; (4) the Metaphysical Poets, Donne and Herbert; (5) the Cavalier Poets, Herrick, Carew, Lovelace, and Suckling; (6) John Milton, his life, his early or Horton poems, his militant prose, and his last great poetical works; (7) John Bunyan, his {{extraordinary}} life, and his chief work, The Pilgrim's Progress; (8) the Minor Prose Writers, Burton, Browne, Fuller, Taylor, Baxter, and Walton. Three books selected from this group are Browne's Religio Medici, Taylor's Holy Living and Dying, and Walton's Complete Angler.|$|E
60|$|Cain (1821) {{is another}} {{dramatic}} poem, reflecting the rebellion of another hero, {{or rather the}} same hero, who appears {{this time as the}} elder son of Adam. After murdering his brother, the hero takes guidance of Lucifer and explores hell; where, instead of repentance, he finds occasion to hate almost everything that is dear to God or man. The drama is a kind of gloomy parody of Milton's Paradise Lost, as Manfred is a parody of Goethe's Faust. Both dramas are interesting, aside from their poetic passages, as examples of the so-called Titan literature, to which we shall presently refer <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>study</b> of Shelley's Prometheus.|$|E

60|$|<b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>study</b> of {{this great}} age we have noted (1) the Non-dramatic Poets, that is, poets who did not write for the stage. The center of this group is Edmund Spenser, whose Shepherd's Calendar (1579) marked the {{appearance}} of the first national poet since Chaucer's death in 1400. His most famous work is The Faery Queen. Associated with Spenser are the minor poets, Thomas Sackville, Michael Drayton, George Chapman, and Philip Sidney. Chapman is noted for his completion of Marlowe's poem, Hero and Leander, and for his translation of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey. Sidney, besides his poetry, wrote his prose romance Arcadia, and The Defense of Poesie, one of our earliest critical essays.|$|E
60|$|<b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>study</b> we have considered: (1) The Poets; {{the life}} and works of Tennyson and Browning; and the chief {{characteristics}} of the minor poets, Elizabeth Barrett (Mrs. Browning), Rossetti, Morris, and Swinburne. (2) The Novelists; {{the life and}} works of Dickens, Thackeray, and George Eliot; and the chief works of Charles Reade, Anthony Trollope, Charlotte Brontë, Bulwer-Lytton, Kingsley, Mrs. Gaskell, Blackmore, George Meredith, Hardy, and Stevenson. (3) The Essayists; the life and works of Macaulay, Matthew Arnold, Carlyle, Newman, and Ruskin. These were selected, from among many essayists and miscellaneous writers, as most typical of the Victorian Age. The great scientists, like Lyell, Darwin, Huxley, Wallace, Tyndall, and Spencer, hardly belong to our study of literature, though their works are of vast importance; and we omit the works of living writers who belong to the present {{rather than to the}} past century.|$|E
6000|$|<b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>study</b> we have noted: (1) {{the great}} epic or heroic poem Beowulf, {{and a few}} {{fragments}} of our first poetry, such as [...] "Widsith," [...] "Deor's Lament," [...] and [...] "The Seafarer." [...] (2) Characteristics of Anglo-Saxon life; the form of our first speech. (3) The Northumbrian school of writers. Bede, our first historian, belongs to this school; but all his extant works are in Latin. The two great poets are Cædmon and Cynewulf. Northumbrian literature flourished between 650 and 850. In the year 867 Northumbria was conquered by the Danes, who destroyed the monasteries and the libraries containing our earliest literature. (4) The beginnings of English prose writing under Alfred (848-901). Our most important prose work of this age is the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which was revised and enlarged by Alfred, and which was continued {{for more than two}} centuries. It is the oldest historical record known to any European nation in its own tongue.|$|E
30|$|A similar {{protocol}} utilizing R. rhizogenes (A 4 T) {{was reported}} by Puddephat et al. (2001). It was successfully applied to produce transgenic broccoli and cauliflower. The most important differences were as follows: the optical density used (≥[*] 1.0 in comparison to ≈[*] 0.3 <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>studies),</b> the way of inoculation (dropping versus immersion <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>studies),</b> {{and the age of}} seedlings undergoing transformation (4 -day-old aseptic seedlings in comparison to 10 -day-old <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>studies).</b> <b>Our</b> parameters yielded the transformation efficiency of 72 % (the number of seedlings with at least 1 hairy root) and of 55 % (measured as the number of inoculated hypocotyls producing at least 1 transgenic hairy-root determined by the GUS assay). In comparison, Puddephat et al. (2001) obtained the maximum transformation efficiency of 8.7 % for histochemically confirmed hairy-roots. Establishing the aforementioned parameters we relied on earlier studies reporting that e.g. lowering bacterial density had a beneficial influence on the transformation effectiveness (Chakrabarty et al. 2002; Henzi et al. 2000). We also believe that a combination of low optical density and optimal seedling age decreases the necrosis rate among explants (although we are aware that younger explants display greater regenerative potential; thus, a compromise has to be established between viability and regenerative rate).|$|R

60|$|It is {{a common}} remark of all foreigners, that there is less social freedom in America than in most other {{countries}} of Christendom. By social freedom, I do not mean as relates to the mere forms of society, for in these we are loose rather than rigid; but that one is less a master of his own acts, his own mode of living, his own time, being more rigidly amenable to public opinion, on all these points, than elsewhere. The fact, I believe, out of all question, is true; at least {{it appears to be}} true, so far as my knowledge of our own and of other countries extends. Admitting then the fact to be so, it is worth while to throw away a moment in inquiring into the consequent good and evil of such a state of things, as well as in looking for the causes. It is always a great assistant <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>study</b> of others, to have some tolerable notions of ourselves.|$|E
