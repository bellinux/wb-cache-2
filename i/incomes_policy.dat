25|$|Forman soon {{established}} himself as a bright and enthusiastic MP. During his first three months in the House he asked 64 formal questions of Ministers in the Labour government. His particular areas of interest were nuclear power, <b>incomes</b> <b>policy,</b> education policy and ministerial patronage. After the Conservatives returned to government in 1979, it was widely expected that Forman would soon obtain ministerial office. He served as Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) first to Lord Carrington in the Foreign Office and later to Douglas Hurd in the Home Office. However, promotion beyond that was slow in coming.|$|E
25|$|After the referendum, Tony Benn was demoted {{from the}} Department for Industry and the Industry Bill was again made weaker. As a backbencher Heffer campaigned against the change {{and for more}} {{investment}} in industry. At the 1975 Labour conference his bid for a National Executive Committee (NEC) seat was finally successful as he defeated Denis Healey. Heffer again became {{known as one of}} the leading left-wing Labour backbenchers who frequently voted against the government. He opposed the government's <b>incomes</b> <b>policy</b> (which had been agreed as a voluntary arrangement with the Trades Union Congress), and abstained rather than support the government's white paper on public expenditure in March 1976 which helped ensure the government's defeat.|$|E

25|$|Heath {{also tried}} to curb the trade unions with the Industrial Relations Act 1971, and hoped to deregulate the economy and make a {{transfer}} from direct to indirect taxation. Rising unemployment in 1972 led him to reflate the economy; he attempted to control the resulting high inflation by a prices and <b>incomes</b> <b>policy.</b> Two miners' strikes, in 1972 and {{at the start of}} 1974, damaged the government; the latter caused the implementation of the Three-Day Week to conserve energy. Heath eventually called an election for February 1974 to obtain a mandate to face down the miners' wage demands, but this instead resulted in a hung parliament in which the Labour Party, despite gaining fewer votes, had four more seats than the Conservatives. Heath resigned as Prime Minister after trying in vain to form a coalition with the Liberal Party. Despite losing a second general election in October that year, he vowed to continue as leader of his party. In February 1975, Margaret Thatcher challenged and defeated him to win the leadership.|$|E
25|$|In 1974 Labour {{returned}} {{to power and}} introduced the Social Contract which implemented a voluntary <b>incomes</b> <b>policy,</b> {{with the backing of}} many left wing union leaders such as Hugh Scanlon and Jack Jones. This period also saw {{an increase in the number}} of full-time union convenors, and these factors along with an increase in unemployment have been blamed by Tony Cliff and the SWP for a drastic fall in union militancy. In 1974 the IS was ambitious and optimistic expecting to double the number of its factory branches over the next year. In practice they declined swiftly from 38 in 1974 to only three or four by 1976. When the firefighters went on strike in 1977 against the Social Contract the IS was unable to deliver any significant solidarity. The national rank and file movement fell apart. In 1976 the SWP decided to stand in parliamentary by-elections but the results were very poor and the original idea of standing in 60 seats at the next election was dropped.|$|E
25|$|Macmillan {{saw in the}} {{by-election}} results {{evidence that}} former Conservative voters would abandon their candidates {{in support of the}} Liberals, who were well placed in Conservative safe seats. In instances where the Liberals had no candidate standing, such as the Labour safe seat of Pontefract, the Conservatives maintained their share of the vote. When a Liberal candidate was fielded, such as at the Stockton-on-Tees by-election in April, in a seat Macmillan himself formerly held, the Conservatives saw large numbers of voters desert them for the Liberals. Later by-elections confirmed the trend. By July the Chairman of the Conservative Party Iain Macleod warned that a government reshuffle was necessary to revitalise flagging support, a view confirmed by Martin Redmayne, the Conservative Chief Whip. Macmillan met with Rab Butler on 21 June. With Conservative unpopularity stemming from economic issues, they discussed replacing Selwyn Lloyd as Chancellor of the Exchequer with Reginald Maudling. Lloyd and Macmillan had already clashed over economic policy: Lloyd was opposed to an <b>incomes</b> <b>policy</b> and reflation, and his austerity measures were causing discontent.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Incomes</b> <b>policies</b> {{have often}} been resorted to during wartime. During the French Revolution, [...] "The Law of the Maximum" [...] imposed price {{controls}} (by penalty of death) in an unsuccessful attempt to curb inflation, and such measures were also attempted after World War II. Peacetime <b>income</b> <b>policies</b> were resorted to in the USA in August 1971 {{as a response to}} inflation. The wage and price controls were effective initially but were made less restrictive in January 1973, and later removed when they seemed to be having no effect on curbing inflation. <b>Incomes</b> <b>policies</b> were successful in the United Kingdom during World War II but less successful in the post-war era.|$|R
40|$|Transition {{countries}}, {{and many}} other countries with incomplete markets, have faced long periods with both high inflation and unemployment. Policies to reduce inflation without high unemployment include <b>incomes</b> <b>policies,</b> which were widely employed in transition countries. This paper studies the effects of <b>incomes</b> <b>policies</b> on inflation in Bulgaria and Poland in 1990 - 1993. The actual policies, which were complex and changing, are examined. The policies do not appear well-designed in a technical sense to reduce inflation. A time-series analysis is made which includes standard determinants of inflation including past inflation, wage increases, exchange rate changes, and monetary changes, plus a dummy for <b>incomes</b> <b>policies.</b> The regressions are fairly successful in fitting standard factors that should influence inflation, particularly the exchange rate and unemployment in Bulgaria and wages and unemployment in Poland. They find a fairly substantial inflation-reducing effect from the Bulgarian policy but no significant results from the Polish policy.

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} is to {{substantiate}} the theoretical and methodological foundations of fair wages and develop indicators for evaluating the labor <b>income</b> <b>policy</b> in terms of implementing the principles of decent work at different levels. It is substantiated that the concept of “decent wages” is an organizational and economic mechanism for determining the basic parameters of wages, which provides a decent level of remuneration, fair distribution of the marginal product between the owner and the employee, timely payment and objective differentiation of wages, as well as transparency of the wage policy. The organizational and economic mechanism for determining the basic parameters of wages should be based on the use of market and contractual elements to regulate the size and structure of remuneration, as well as innovative approaches and tools for the formation of various components of remuneration for work. There proposed indicators with the identification of evaluation standards of the labor <b>income</b> <b>policy</b> in terms of implementing decent work principles at macro and micro levels. The developed indicators should serve as a tool for assessing the current state and trends {{in the development of the}} labor <b>income</b> <b>policy</b> through the prism of the implementation of the principles of decent work. Further research should focus on developing indicators for evaluating the labor <b>income</b> <b>policies</b> in terms of implementing decent work principles at sectoral and regional levels, monitoring the labor <b>income</b> <b>policies,</b> and elaborating innovative mechanisms for developing the labor <b>income</b> <b>policies</b> based on decent work at different levels...|$|R
25|$|One of {{the rare}} German Keynesians of that era, Schiller {{believed}} that government had both “the obligation {{and the capacity to}} shape economic trends and to smooth out and even eliminate the business cycle,” and his adopted policy of Keynesian demand management helped West Germany to overcome the economic recession of 1966/67. Unemployment was quickly reduced (standing at just under 1% by Autumn 1968), while industrial output rose by almost 12% in 1968. The successful economic and financial policies pursued by the Grand Coalition under the direction of Schiller was also helped by the persuasion of entrepreneurs and trade unions to accept a programme of “concerted action.” According to Lisanne Radice and Giles Radice, “concerted action” was not a formal <b>incomes</b> <b>policy,</b> but it did nevertheless ensure that collective bargaining took place “within a broadly agreed view of the direction of the economy and the relationships between full employment, output and inflation.” In addition, Schiller's economic policies were not only successful in restoring West Germany's economic growth, but they also demonsteated the SPD's economic competence, and this undoubtedly {{played a major role in}} the victory of the SPD in the federal election of 1969.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} when Nixon took office in January 1969, {{inflation}} was at 4.7%, its highest rate since the Korean War, and rising. The Great Society had been enacted under Johnson, which, together with the Vietnam War costs, was causing large budget deficits. There was little unemployment (3.3%,), but interest rates were at their highest in a century. Nixon's major economic goal was to reduce inflation; the most obvious means of doing so was to end the war. That however could not be accomplished overnight. The administration adopted a policy of restricting {{the growth of the}} money supply to address the inflation problem. In February 1970, {{as a part of the}} effort to keep federal spending down, Nixon delayed pay raises to federal employees by six months. When the nation's postal workers went on strike, he used the Army to keep the postal system going. In the end, the government met the postal workers' wage demands, undoing some of the desired budget-balancing. According to political economist Nigel Bowles's 2011 study of Nixon's economic policies, the new president did little to alter Johnson's policies through the first year of his presidency. The president and congressional Republicans entered the 1970 campaign season faced with unemployment, inflation, and Democratic demands for an <b>incomes</b> <b>policy,</b> all of which contributed to a lackluster Republican performance in the midterm congressional elections (Republicans gained two seats in the Senate but lost nine in the House; Democrats controlled both Houses of Congress throughout Nixon's presidency).|$|E

40|$|Economic {{research}} overwhelmingly {{shows that}} the utility individuals derive from their income depends on the incomes of others. Theoretical literature has proven that these status effects imply a more egalitarian <b>income</b> <b>policy</b> than in the conventional case, in which people value their income independently from the income of others. This article qualifies this conclusion in three ways. First, this policy implication holds if low income groups are sensitive to status, but not if high income groups are predominantly so. Neither do status effects provide an economic rational for egalitarian <b>income</b> <b>policy</b> if they only pertain to peer groups with similar income levels. Third, if status effects are grounded in vices like envy, jealousy, grudgingness or spite, a moral basis for egalitarian <b>income</b> <b>policy</b> is lacking, because distributive justice cannot be based on perverse preferences. ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{place of}} luxury taxes, the {{economist}} Robert H.

Another option is the redistribution of wealth, either by means of an <b>incomes</b> <b>policy</b> or by progressive taxation. Because the activity of conspicuous consumption, itself, is a form of superior good, diminishing the income inequality of the income distribution by way of an egalitarian policy reduces the conspicuous consumption of positional goods and services. In Wealth and Welfare (1912), the economist A. C. Pigou said that the redistribution of wealth might lead to great gains in social welfare: ...|$|E
