If there is a sufficient portion of the upper duodenum remaining a Billroth <b>I</b> <b>procedure</b> is performed, where the remaining portion of the stomach is reattached to the duodenum before the bile duct and the duct of the pancreas. If the stomach cannot be reattached to the duodenum a Billroth II is performed, where the remaining portion of the duodenum is sealed off, a hole is cut into the next section of the small intestine called the jejunum and the stomach is reattached at this hole. As the pylorus is used to grind food and slowly release the food into the small intestine, removal of the pylorus can cause food to move into the small intestine faster than normal, leading to gastric dumping syndrome.|$|E
40|$|Objective The hybrid stage <b>I</b> <b>procedure</b> is an {{alternative}} palliative strategy for patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome who traditionally have undergone the N orwood operation. At our institution, the hybrid stage <b>I</b> <b>procedure</b> is employed only for patients with high operative risk. Our objective was to describe our use of a pressure guidewire during the hybrid stage <b>I</b> <b>procedure</b> to assess quantitatively pulmonary artery band adequacy. Design After reviewing the charts on all high‐risk patients who underwent a hybrid stage <b>I</b> <b>procedure</b> at our institution, we compared two groups of patients: those who underwent the standard hybrid stage I palliation (standard cohort) and those with pressure wire‐facilitated assessment of distal branch pulmonary artery pressure (pressure wire cohort) to evaluate the impact of pressure guidewire use on procedural risk, radiation time, patient outcomes, and need for reoperation for pulmonary artery band adjustment. Results The pressure guidewire was used in 8 of 14 patients {{at the time of}} hybrid stage <b>I</b> <b>procedure</b> and was successful and without complication in all attempts. In the standard cohort, 67 % of patients needed reoperation for pulmonary artery band adjustment, compared to 12. 5 % of patients in the pressure wire cohort (P =. 09). Procedure time, radiation exposure, and survival to hospital discharge were not different between groups. Conclusions This novel use of a pressure guidewire to assess quantitatively pulmonary artery band adequacy at the time of placement is feasible, safe and may decrease the need for reoperation for pulmonary artery band adjustment...|$|E

40|$|The South of England Cochlear Implant Centre (SOECIC) Music Test Battery (MTB) {{is a new}} {{battery of}} tests {{currently}} under development, designed {{for the assessment of}} cochlear implant (CI) users’ music perception in the clinic. The MTB consists of pitch discrimination, pitch identification and rhythm discrimination tests. This research project investigated the test-retest reliability of the SOECIC MTB and examined whether two different response methods influenced the test-retest reliability of the tests. Twenty normal hearing participants were recruited to complete the tests using both a three interval three alternative forced choice (3 <b>I</b> 3 AFC) <b>procedure</b> and a three interval two alternative forced choice (3 <b>I</b> 2 AFC) <b>procedure.</b> The test sessions were repeated on three separate occasions, in order to assess test-retest reliability. Eighteen of the twenty participants recruited completed all the test sessions and were included in the data analyses. It was hypothesised that the 3 <b>I</b> 2 AFC <b>procedure</b> would produce more consistent results compared to the 3 <b>I</b> 3 AFC <b>procedure.</b> This is because the presence of a reference tone (3 <b>I</b> 2 AFC <b>procedure)</b> would assist the participant by providing a constant point by which to make a comparison. If the tests were reliable, then the participants’ scores would not change significantly when testing was repeated. A comparison of group means showed that scores did not statistically differ for the three test sessions for either response method, indicating that there was not an effect of time. Further statistical analyses showed moderate to strong correlations between the three test sessions when participants were using the 3 <b>I</b> 3 AFC <b>procedure.</b> However, the correlations were weaker (some not statistically significant, p> 0. 05) between the test sessions when participants were using the 3 <b>I</b> 2 AFC <b>procedure.</b> It was concluded that the SOECIC MTB demonstrated test-retest reliability when administered to a small sample of normal hearing listeners. The correlations between test sessions imply that the 3 <b>I</b> 3 AFC <b>procedure</b> should be retained over the 3 <b>I</b> 2 AFC <b>procedure</b> for future testing.

40|$|ObjectiveNo {{method of}} {{measuring}} technical performance exists {{for the stage}} I Norwood procedure. Hospital mortality is usually used as a surrogate for technical performance, but evidence is lacking to support this concept. A technical score was designed by expert consensus. MethodsThe technical score included the following steps: (1) Stage I was divided into subprocedures according to anatomic areas where an intervention is performed. (2) For each subprocedure, three score categories (optimal, adequate, and inadequate) were defined {{on the basis of}} echocardiography, catheterization, and/or clinical data. (3) Subprocedures were analyzed for the whole group and by surgeon. (4) Overall repair was also scored: optimal if all attempted subprocedures were optimal, inadequate if any was inadequate, and adequate for everything in between. (5) All patients undergoing the stage <b>I</b> <b>procedure</b> from January 2004 to December 2006 were retrospectively studied. ResultsOne hundred ten patients were included (operated on by six surgeons), and 4 were excluded for lack of reliable postoperative data. Most subprocedures were scored as optimal. Subprocedures with the largest inadequate scores were distal arch reconstruction in 7 (6 %) patients and aortopulmonary shunt in 3 (5 %). No statistical differences were found among surgeons either by subprocedure or by overall outcome, although individual sample sizes were small. The overall score correlated with length of stay, extracorporeal membrane oxygenator support, and hospital mortality. ConclusionsTechnical performance can be measured after the stage <b>I</b> <b>procedure,</b> and performance score correlates with early outcome. This score may also be useful as a self-assessment tool...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundSurvival after stage I palliation for hypoplastic left heart {{syndrome}} {{or related}} anomalies remains poor in high-risk neonates. We hypothesized that a less invasive hybrid {{approach would be}} beneficial in this patient population. MethodsThe hybrid stage <b>I</b> <b>procedure</b> was performed in the catheterization laboratory. Via a median sternotomy, both branch pulmonary arteries were banded, and a ductal stent was delivered via a main pulmonary artery puncture and positioned under fluoroscopic guidance. ResultsBetween October 2003 and June 2005, 14 high-risk neonates underwent a hybrid stage <b>I</b> <b>procedure.</b> Eleven of 14 had hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Two also underwent peratrial atrial septal stenting, and 5 required percutaneous atrial stenting later. Two neonates with an intact or highly restrictive atrial septum had emergency percutaneous atrial stent placement. Hospital survival was 11 (78. 5 %) of 14. One patient required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support for intraoperative cardiac arrest. He underwent cardiac transplantation but died later of sepsis. One patient died of ductal stent embolization, and a third died of progressive cardiac dysfunction. The first 4 patients required pulmonary artery band revisions. There were none after we modified our technique and added branch pulmonary artery angiograms. There were 2 interstage deaths from atrial stent occlusion and from preductal retrograde coarctation. Eight patients underwent stage II procedures, consisting of aortic arch reconstruction, atrial septectomy, and cavopulmonary shunt. Two patients died after stage II. One patient is awaiting stage II. ConclusionsThe hybrid stage I palliation is a valid option in high-risk neonates. As experience is accrued, it may become the preferred alternative. However, in aortic atresia, the development of preductal retrograde coarctation is a significant problem...|$|E

Adaptive compensations in mandibular growth following orthognathic surgery or orthodontic therapy could explain the alteration in the direction of condylar growth. Superior maxillary repositioning by LeFort I osteotomy alters post-surgical mandibular remodeling and condylar growth [37].
