5|$|Bruce {{set about}} {{applying}} his business principles to his cabinet, putting {{his experience as}} both a corporate manager and rowing coach to use in a cabinet system that was orderly and practical. He implemented a formal system whereby a proper agenda for cabinet meetings would be formulated, and the minister responsible <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>item</b> would circulate papers to bring other members {{up to speed on}} the issue. His decision-making procedures ensured that his colleagues were informed and actively participated in decisions or if they disagreed, gave leave for cabinet members to absent themselves from meetings to preserve cabinet solidarity. In this respect Bruce earned the quick respect and approval of his colleagues, and in many respects came to dominate cabinet through his industriousness and knowledgability. Cabinet minister George Pearce would later conclude that Bruce was the best of the prime ministers that he served or opposed in his 38-year parliamentary career.|$|E

25|$|Items {{obtained}} by the museum initially were received, conserved, and stored at the Smithsonian Museum Support Center in Suitland, Maryland. Dozens of permanent curatorial staff and temporary contractors accessed the items, repaired them, and conserved them in a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment. Renée Anderson, the NMAAHC's head of collections, oversaw the effort. After artifacts were selected for display, graphics and labels <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>item</b> were manufactured. Display cases <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>item</b> were also purchased, and exhibiting mounts or specially designed cases handcrafted for particularly fragile, important, or unusually sized objects.

That document contains virtually no information about biodiversity. However, the country's fourth national report to the CBD contains a detailed breakdown of the numbers of species of each kingdom of life recorded from Cuba, the main groups being: animals (17,801 species), bacteria (270), chromista (707), fungi, including lichen-forming species (5844), plants (9107) and protozoa (1440).|$|E
25|$|The GPO {{created a}} network of post offices where senders could submit items. All post was {{transferred}} from the post office of origination to distribution points called sorting stations, and from there the post was then sent on for delivery to the receiver of the post. Initially it was {{the recipient of the}} post who paid the fee, and he had the right to refuse to accept the item if he did not wish to pay. The charge was based on the distance the item had been carried so the GPO had to keep a separate account <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>item.</b> In 1840 the Uniform Penny Post was introduced, which incorporated the two key innovations of a uniform postal rate, which cut administrative costs and encouraged use of the system, and adhesive pre-paid stamp.|$|E
25|$|This {{abridged}} {{version of the}} K-SADS focuses on mania and is a combination/modification of Geller's WASH-U-KSADS and the 4th revision of the KSADS-P (by Joaquim Puig-Antich and Neal Ryan) Specifically, it assess 21 symptoms related to mania, hypomania, and rapid cycling. Each item is rated on a 0-6 rating scale. Scores of 0 suggest no information is available; scores of 1 suggest the symptom is not present at all; scores of 2 suggest the symptom is slightly present; scores of 3 suggest the symptom is mildly severe; scores of 4 suggest the symptom is moderately severe; scores of 5 suggest the symptom is severe; and scores of 6 suggest the symptom is extremely severe. Items with scores of 4 or higher are clinically significant/maladaptive. Trained clinicians or clinical researchers administer the assessment to both {{the child and the}} parent, which each provide their own separate score <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>item</b> (P and C), and the total score encompasses the sum of all of the items (S).|$|E

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the problem of {{minimize}} the waste of space that occurs on a placement of a set of bi-dimensional items inside a bi-dimensional container with fixed dimensions. This problem is approached with an heuristic based on Simulated Annealing (SA), which is in-spired on the physic-chemical process that takes place during the recrystallization of a metal. Traditional “external penalization” techniques are avoided through the application of no–fit polygons, that represents collision-free areas <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>items</b> before its placement. That gives to the proposed process a more universal character, as external penalization is based on empiric parameters of great influence on the optimization performance. The SA controls: the rotation and the placement. <b>For</b> <b>each</b> non–placed <b>item...</b>|$|R

25|$|Prescription {{drugs and}} medical {{appliances}} {{are available to}} all for a small fee (medical card holders), reduced cost (Drugs Payment Scheme) or in certain circumstances free (under the Long Term Illness Scheme) to residents of Ireland. The Drugs Payment Scheme ensures that every household only has to pay a maximum of €144 per calendar month for up to one month's supply of prescribed medicines and medical appliances. Some private health insurance plans provide partial reimbursement up to the Drugs Payment Scheme threshold. Those who {{are entitled to a}} medical card pay a government levy <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>item</b> dispensed. The levy is €2.50 for under 70s and €2.00 for over 70s, up to a maximum of €25/€20 per family per calendar month. Those who are suffering from one of a list of 16 long-term illnesses do not have to pay for medicines or medical appliances related to their conditions. Ireland has below average use of generic medication according to the OECD, despite being a major exporter.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, Christopher P. Earley {{hypothesized}} that social loafing would be mitigated in collectivist cultures that {{focused more on}} achievement of the group than the individual. He conducted {{a study in the}} United States and China, two polar opposites in terms of culture (with the U.S. being individualistic and China being collectivist), in order to determine if a difference in social loafing was present between the two types of cultures. Earley formed groups from both countries similar in demographics and in time spent with each other (participants in each of the groups had known each other for three to five weeks). Each group was tasked with completing various forms of paperwork similar to work they would be required to do in their profession. The paperwork was designed to take two to five minutes <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>item,</b> and the items were turned in to an assistant when completed so that no one could judge their work compared to others. Each participant was given 60 minutes to complete as many items as possible and was separated into either the high-accountability group, where they were told they needed to achieve a group goal, or a low-accountability group, where they were told they were to achieve a goal alone. They were also separated into high and low shared responsibility groups.|$|E
25|$|Once all the {{preparations}} are made, battle begins. Turn order is decided by a countdown based on agility, last move used and formation. A player character may select from {{as many as}} eight different skills: one normal skill <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>item,</b> and, if they are well trained with that item and the OverDrive Gauge is sufficiently filled, a secondary, more interesting OverSkill. Using a skill, however, reduces how many more times that item can be used, as Riviera employs a Fire Emblem-styled system of item endurance allowing the item to be used only a certain amount of times before it breaks entirely. The OverDrive Gauge fills throughout battle, as characters receive and deal damage, and with certain skills. At various levels, characters can use different skills, because certain skills require more of the gauge be filled. There are five levels of skills for player characters: Level 0 skills that may be used whenever and without training; Levels 1 through 3 skills, which require training and deplete that amount of the OverDrive Gauge; and Execution Level skills that may be used at any level of OverDrive Gauge fullness, but will shatter the gauge for the battle, and are only obtained through the story. Enemies have a similar gauge with three levels: Normal, Rage and Max. At Normal they may only use normal attacks. At Rage they may use Rage and Normal attacks, but the latter depletes the gauge. At Max, they may use all three, but only Max skills will deplete the gauge, and will deplete it fully. Enemies also have Etc. attacks, ranging from healing to transformation, that may be used at any time.|$|E

500|$|The album's art {{design was}} {{credited}} to Capitol's in-house designer, Roy Kohara. Harrison supplied sketches <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>item</b> of the artwork, which adopted a humorous, [...] "wacky" [...] theme throughout the packaging. The vivid-orange front cover featured a die-cut design around the words [...] "EXTRA TEXTURE", through which an inner-sleeve, blue-tinted picture of Harrison was visible. Some vinyl editions presented {{the words as}} simple blue text on an orange background, however, doing away with the expensive cut-out detail. In keeping with the album title, the thin cardboard used for the LP cover was similar in texture to the [...] "animal skin used on a football", according to Beatles author Bruce Spizer. The front cover included an Om symbol, positioned below the angled title text and also coloured blue. On {{the back of the}} inner sleeve, there was a second Henry Grossman tour photo of Harrison, clearly enjoying himself on stage.|$|E

It was replaced by commentator Mitch Johnson, who, {{as well as providing}} commentary and links <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>item,</b> would interact with both audience and presenters too. From the second series, two puppet leprachauns, later named as Sage and Onion became regulars. They were played by Don Austen and John Eccleston, and were designed and built by Darryl Worbey Studios. They performed comedy sketches throughout the morning, and often interacted with the people in the studio. Another comedy character who first appeared in the third series was Mr Blobby, who had previously appeared in Noel's House Party. Most regular features were dropped for the final series, when the show was revamped. A feature that stuck throughout was the jingle for the phone number, first 081 811 8181, then 0181 811 8181, then 0845 610 1515.|$|E

500|$|Zero-sum DKP {{systems are}} {{designed}} to ensure the net change in points among the raid is zero <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>item</b> dropped, as the name might suggest. [...] When the item drops, each player who is interested in it indicates as much to a guild leader. [...] The player who has the highest DKP total receives the item for its specified price and {{the same number of}} points are divided evenly among the rest of the raid and given out, resulting in no net change to the raid total. [...] As a result, the raid would only be rewarded DKP if at least one player desired the item dropped by the boss. [...] Since over time guilds will revisit the same boss multiple times, some zero-sum DKP systems are modified to introduce a [...] "dummy" [...] character which may be awarded DKP for the boss 'kill' even though no player in the guild received an item. [...] This is purely an accounting measure and allows the guild to reward players for defeating a boss if they are using an automated point tracking system.|$|E
