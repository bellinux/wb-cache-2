5|$|As {{early as}} February 1933, Hitler {{announced}} that rearmament must be undertaken, albeit clandestinely at first, as {{to do so}} was {{in violation of the}} Versailles Treaty. A year later he told his military leaders that 1942 was the target date for going to war in the east. He pulled Germany out of the League of Nations in 1933, claiming its disarmament clauses were unfair as they applied only to Germany. The Saarland, which had been placed under League of Nations supervision for 15 years at the end of World War <b>I,</b> <b>voted</b> in January 1935 to become part of Germany. In March 1935, Hitler announced that the Reichswehr would be increased to 550,000 men and that he was creating an air force. Britain agreed that the Germans would be allowed to build a naval fleet with the signing of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement on 18 June 1935.|$|E

He later stated he had misgivings about the Bush administration's stance, but said he felt pressure in his tight Senate race to go along with it. In 2005, he said [...] "it was obvious that if <b>I</b> <b>voted</b> against the resolution that I would be dead meat in the race, just handing them in a victory." [...] He characterized his vote for war as [...] "the worst vote I cast." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a rare 2002 {{interview}} with the Phoenix New Times, Harris recalled her ambivalence about even bringing the troupe to New York from Chicago. She said, [...] "When I was at Second City, there was a vote about whether we should take our show to Broadway or not. Andrew Duncan and <b>I</b> <b>voted</b> no. I stayed in New York, but only because Richard Rodgers and Alan Jay Lerner came and said, 'We {{want to write a}} musical for you!' Well, I wasn't big on musical theater.

2500|$|In 2009, Gerlach opposed HR 2454, {{which was}} {{designed}} to amend several laws related to energy and the environment, and included a “cap-and-trade” program to limit greenhouse gas emissions. As Gerlach later explained, “While the bill included some positive provisions to develop alternative and renewable energy our country needs, <b>I</b> <b>voted</b> against this bill because of the devastating effect it will have on working families and the people who create jobs in my district and across Pennsylvania." [...] The League of Conservation Voters, “a national non-profit organization that works to turn environmental values into national priorities,” rated Gerlach at 44 percent on their National Environmental Scorecard. In his 2010 campaign, Gerlach received $41,250 from the Energy/Natural Resource sector.|$|E
2500|$|On August 18, 1955, Seeger was subpoenaed {{to testify}} before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Alone among the many {{witnesses}} after the 1950 conviction and imprisonment of the Hollywood Ten for contempt of Congress, Seeger refused to plead the Fifth Amendment (which would have asserted that his testimony might be self incriminating) and instead, as the Hollywood Ten had done, refused to name personal and political associations on the grounds that this would violate his First Amendment rights: [...] "I am not going to answer any questions as to my association, my philosophical or religious beliefs or my political beliefs, or how <b>I</b> <b>voted</b> in any election, or any of these private affairs. I think these are very improper questions for any American to be asked, especially under such compulsion as this." [...] Seeger's refusal to answer questions that violated his fundamental Constitutional rights led to a March 26, 1957, indictment for contempt of Congress; for some years, he had to keep the federal government apprised of where he was going any time he left the Southern District of New York. He was convicted in a jury trial of contempt of Congress in March 1961, and sentenced to ten 1-year terms in jail (to be served simultaneously), but in May 1962, an appeals court ruled the indictment to be flawed and overturned his conviction.|$|E

But now I am a farmer--a farmer up in Connecticut, and winning laurels.

60|$|It was {{for this}} reason, {{more than any}} other, and more ardently than any other, that I rode down into the Valley of the Moon, all a-jingle, and voted for equal suffrage. <b>I</b> <b>voted</b> that women might vote, because I knew that they, the wives and mothers of the race, would vote John Barleycorn out of {{existence}} {{and back into the}} historical limbo of our vanished customs of savagery.

60|$|Under the {{impression}} of these sentiments, (and not as wanting every attention to my constituents which affection and gratitude could inspire,) <b>I</b> <b>voted</b> for these bills which give you so much trouble. <b>I</b> <b>voted</b> for them, not as doing complete justice to Ireland, but as being something less unjust than the general prohibition which has hitherto prevailed. I hear some discourse as if, {{in one or two}} paltry duties on materials, Ireland had a preference, and that those who set themselves against this act of scanty justice assert that they are only contending for an equality. What equality? Do they forget that the whole woollen manufacture of Ireland, the most extensive and profitable of any, and the natural staple of that kingdom, has been in a manner so destroyed by restrictive laws of ours, and (at our persuasion, and on our promises) by restrictive laws of their own, that in a few years, it is probable, {{they will not be able}} to wear a coat of their own fabric? Is this equality? Do gentlemen forget that the understood faith upon which they were persuaded to such an unnatural act has not been kept,--but a linen-manufacture has been set up, and highly encouraged, against them? Is this equality? Do they forget the state of the trade of Ireland in beer, so great an article of consumption, and which now stands in so mischievous a position with regard to their revenue, their manufacture, and their agriculture? Do they find any equality in all this? Yet, if the least step is taken towards doing them common justice in the slightest articles for the most limited markets, a cry is raised, as if we were going to be ruined by partiality to Ireland.|$|E
