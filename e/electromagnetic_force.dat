5|$|The {{electrons}} of an atom {{are attracted}} to the protons in an atomic nucleus by this <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>force.</b> The protons and neutrons in the nucleus {{are attracted to}} each other by a different force, the nuclear force, which is usually stronger than the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>force</b> repelling the positively charged protons from one another. Under certain circumstances, the repelling <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>force</b> becomes stronger than the nuclear force, and nucleons can be ejected from the nucleus, leaving behind a different element: nuclear decay resulting in nuclear transmutation.|$|E
5|$|A photon {{is a type}} of {{elementary}} particle, the quantum of the electromagnetic field including electromagnetic radiation such as light, and the force carrier for the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>force</b> (even when static via virtual particles). The photon has zero rest mass and always moves {{at the speed of light}} within a vacuum.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the forces}} in the {{universe}} are based on four fundamental interactions. The strong and weak forces are nuclear forces that act only at very short distances, and {{are responsible for the}} interactions between subatomic particles, including nucleons and compound nuclei. The <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>force</b> acts between electric charges, and the gravitational force acts between masses. All other forces in nature derive from these four fundamental interactions. For example, friction is a manifestation of the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>force</b> acting between the atoms of two surfaces, and the Pauli exclusion principle, which does not permit atoms to pass through each other. Similarly, the forces in springs, modeled by Hooke's law, are the result of electromagnetic forces and the Exclusion Principle acting together to return an object to its equilibrium position. Centrifugal forces are acceleration forces that arise simply from the acceleration of rotating frames of reference.|$|E
50|$|Unlike real <b>forces</b> such as <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>forces,</b> fictitious forces do not {{originate}} from physical interactions between objects.|$|R

5|$|However, it {{is better}} {{described}} as a non-contact force field having a finite range, albeit very short. In 1968, Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam and Steven Weinberg unified the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>force</b> and the weak interaction by showing them to be two aspects of a single force, now termed the electro-weak force.|$|E
5|$|However, {{attempting}} to reconcile electromagnetic theory with two observations, the photoelectric effect, and the nonexistence of the ultraviolet catastrophe, proved troublesome. Through {{the work of}} leading theoretical physicists, a new theory of electromagnetism was developed using quantum mechanics. This final modification to electromagnetic theory ultimately led to quantum electrodynamics (or QED), which fully describes all electromagnetic phenomena as being mediated by wave–particles known as photons. In QED, photons are the fundamental exchange particle, which described all interactions relating to electromagnetism including the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{particle}} physics, {{the weak}} interaction (the weak force or weak nuclear force) is {{the mechanism of}} interaction between sub-atomic particles that causes radioactive decay and thus plays {{an essential role in}} nuclear fission. The theory of the weak interaction is sometimes called quantum flavourdynamics (QFD), in analogy with the terms quantum chromodynamics (QCD) dealing with the strong interaction and quantum electrodynamics (QED) dealing with the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>force.</b> However, the term QFD is rarely used because the weak force is best understood in terms of electro-weak theory (EWT).|$|E
50|$|<b>Electromagnetic</b> <b>forces</b> {{due to the}} {{presence}} of an electrical field are more precisely named electrostatic forces.|$|R
50|$|Eddy {{currents}} in conductors of non-zero resistivity generate heat {{as well as}} <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>forces.</b> The heat {{can be used for}} induction heating. The <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>forces</b> can be used for levitation, creating movement, or to give a strong braking effect. Eddy currents can also have undesirable effects, for instance power loss in transformers. In this application, they are minimized with thin plates, by lamination of conductors or other details of conductor shape.|$|R
50|$|The {{residual}} {{strong force}} {{is thus a}} minor residuum of the strong force that binds quarks together into protons and neutrons. This same force is much weaker between neutrons and protons, because it is mostly neutralized within them, {{in the same way}} that <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>forces</b> between neutral atoms (van der Waals forces) are much weaker than the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>forces</b> that hold electrons in association with the nucleus, forming the atoms.|$|R
5|$|In {{the case}} of the weak interaction, fermions can {{exchange}} three distinct types of force carriers known as the W+, W−, and Z bosons. The mass of each of these bosons is far greater than the mass of a proton or neutron, which is consistent with the short range of the weak force. The force is in fact termed weak because its field strength over a given distance is typically several orders of magnitude less than that of the strong nuclear force or <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{electrons}} in an atom {{are attracted to}} the protons in the nucleus by the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>force.</b> This force binds the {{electrons in}}side an electrostatic potential well surrounding the smaller nucleus, which means that an external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape. The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the greater the attractive force. Hence electrons bound {{near the center of}} the potential well require more energy to escape than those at greater separations.|$|E
5|$|The {{noble gases}} have full valence {{electron}} shells. Valence electrons are the outermost electrons of an atom and are normally the only electrons that participate in chemical bonding. Atoms with full valence electron shells are extremely stable and therefore do not tend to form chemical bonds and have little tendency to gain or lose electrons. However, heavier noble gases such as radon are held less firmly together by <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>force</b> than lighter noble gases such as helium, {{making it easier}} to remove outer electrons from heavy noble gases.|$|E
5|$|Photons inside superconductors do {{develop a}} nonzero {{effective}} rest mass; as a result, <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>forces</b> become short-range inside superconductors.|$|R

5|$|The weak {{interaction}} affects all the fermions of the Standard Model, {{as well as}} the Higgs boson; neutrinos interact through gravity and the {{weak interaction}} only, and neutrinos were the original reason for the name weak force. The weak interaction does not produce bound states (nor does it involve binding energy) – something that gravity does on an astronomical scale, that the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>force</b> does at the atomic level, and that the strong nuclear force does inside nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Study {{has shown}} that the origin of charge is from certain types of {{subatomic}} particles which have the property of electric charge. Electric charge gives rise to and interacts with the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>force,</b> one of the four fundamental forces of nature. The most familiar carriers of electrical charge are the electron and proton. Experiment has shown charge to be a conserved quantity, that is, the net charge within an isolated system will always remain constant regardless of any changes taking place within that system. Within the system, charge may be transferred between bodies, either by direct contact, or by passing along a conducting material, such as a wire. The informal term static electricity refers to the net presence (or 'imbalance') of charge on a body, usually caused when dissimilar materials are rubbed together, transferring charge from one to the other.|$|E

50|$|<b>Electromagnetic</b> <b>forces</b> can {{be defined}} as forces arising from the {{presence}} of an electromagnetic field (electrical field only, magnetic field only, or both).|$|R
50|$|A {{deformation}} may {{be caused}} by external loads, body forces (such as gravity or <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>forces),</b> or changes in temperature, moisture content, or chemical reactions, etc.|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of the studies {{performed}} at JRC-Ispra for NET/INTOR, a modular stainless steel first wall, water cooled, and separated from the blanket which it envelops like a box has been proposed. During plasma disruption the metallic structure of the first wall is inevitably subject to appreciable <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>forces</b> caused by induced eddy current-magnetic field interactions. These forces produce deformations and stresses in the wall structure, which have to be considered {{in the design of the}} first wall. The behaviour of this type of structure under the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>forces</b> mentioned was analysed. The <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>forces</b> were evaluated by means of a finite element code for shell-type structure in 3 -D geometry, for the case of a 20 ms plasma disruption. The deformation and stress distributions in the first wall were quantified at various instants of time by three-dimensional calculations using the ICES-STRUDL code...|$|R

25|$|The Standard Model {{describes}} {{three of}} the four fundamental forces in nature; only gravity remains unexplained. In the Standard Model, a force is described as an exchange of bosons between the objects affected, such as a photon for the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>force</b> and a gluon for the strong interaction. Those particles are called force carriers or messenger particles.|$|E

Here, we calculate the temperature rise from the equation of heat flow in an isolated object to be deformed.

25|$|The {{electric}} charge {{is a fundamental}} conserved property of some subatomic particles, which determines their electromagnetic interaction. Electrically charged matter is influenced by, and produces, electromagnetic fields.

25|$|In physics, many {{quantities}} {{are naturally}} represented by alternating operators. For example, if {{the motion of}} a charged particle is described by velocity and acceleration vectors in four-dimensional spacetime, then normalization of the velocity vector requires that the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>force</b> must be an alternating operator on the velocity.
