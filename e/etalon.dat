5|$|The {{heart of}} the Fabry–Pérot {{interferometer}} {{is a pair of}} partially silvered glass optical flats spaced several millimeters to centimeters apart with the silvered surfaces facing each other. (Alternatively, a Fabry–Pérot <b>etalon</b> uses a transparent plate with two parallel reflecting surfaces.) As with the Fizeau interferometer, the flats are slightly beveled. In a typical system, illumination is provided by a diffuse source set at the focal plane of a collimating lens. A focusing lens produces what would be an inverted image of the source if the paired flats were not present; i.e. {{in the absence of the}} paired flats, all light emitted from point A passing through the optical system would be focused at point A'. In Fig.6, only one ray emitted from point A on the source is traced. As the ray passes through the paired flats, it is multiply reflected to produce multiple transmitted rays which are collected by the focusing lens and brought to point A' on the screen. The complete interference pattern takes the appearance of a set of concentric rings. The sharpness of the rings depends on the reflectivity of the flats. If the reflectivity is high, resulting in a high Q factor (i.e. high finesse), monochromatic light produces a set of narrow bright rings against a dark background. In Fig.6, the low-finesse image corresponds to a reflectivity of 0.04 (i.e. unsilvered surfaces) versus a reflectivity of 0.95 for the high-finesse image.|$|E

500|$|Five La-7s {{were built}} in March by Factory (...) Nr. 381 in Moscow and three of these were {{accepted}} by the Air Force that same month. The Moscow factory was the fastest to complete transition over to La-7 production and the last La-5FN was built there in May 1944. Zavod Nr. 21 in Gorky was considerably slower to make the change as it did not exhaust its stock of wooden La-5 wings until October. The quality of the early production aircraft was significantly less than the <b>etalon</b> due to issues with the engine, incomplete sealing of the cowling and fuselage, and defective propellers. One such aircraft was tested, after these problems had been fixed, by the Flight Research Institute (...) and proved to be only [...] slower than the <b>etalon</b> at altitude.

The absence of standard <b>etalons</b> in software measurement is having {{a negative impact on}} software engineers when they come to use measurement results in decision-making. To verify measurement results and ensure unambiguous comparability across contexts, researchers in software measurement should design standard <b>etalons</b> and incorporate them into the design of every measure proposed. Since the design process for establishing standard <b>etalons</b> for software measures has not yet been investigated, this paper tackles this issue and illustrates the application of this process using ISO 19761 : COSMIC-FFP...|$|R

The threads landed in three random undulating positions. He varnished them into place on the blue-black canvas strips and attached them to glass. He then cut three wood slats into the shapes of the curved strings, and put all the pieces into a croquet box.

2500|$|The ALADIN instrument, {{essentially}} a direct detection lidar, {{consists of three}} major elements: a transmitter, a combined Mie and Rayleigh backscattering receiver assembly, and a Cassegrain telescope with a [...] diameter. The transmitter architecture {{is based on a}} 150 mJ diode-pumped frequency-tripled [...] operating in the ultraviolet at 355nm. The Mie receiver consists of a Fizeau spectrometer with a resolution of 100MHz (equivalent to 18m/s). The received backscatter signal produces a linear fringe whose position is directly linked to the wind velocity; the wind speed is determined by the fringe centroid position to better than a tenth of the resolution (1.8m/s). The Raleigh receiver employs a dual-filter Fabry–Pérot interferometer with a 2GHz resolution and 5GHz spacing. It analyzes the wings of the Rayleigh spectrum with a CCD; the <b>etalon</b> is split into two zones, which are imaged separately on the detector.|$|E

5000|$|In optics, a Fabry-Pérot {{interferometer}} (FPI) or <b>etalon</b> {{is typically}} {{made of a}} transparent plate with two reflecting surfaces, or two parallel highly reflecting mirrors.

50|$|The varying {{transmission}} {{function of}} an <b>etalon</b> {{is caused by}} interference between the multiple reflections of light between the two reflecting surfaces.

Whether the multiply reflected beams are in phase or not depends on the wavelength (λ) of the light (in vacuum), the angle the light travels through the <b>etalon</b> (θ), {{the thickness of the}} <b>etalon</b> (ℓ) and the refractive index of the material between the reflecting surfaces (n).|$|E
