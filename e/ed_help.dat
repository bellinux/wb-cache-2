40|$|Background: Approximately one {{in three}} older adults (aged 65 and over) fall each year. Such falls {{commonly}} present at <b>EDs</b> (<b>Help</b> the Aged, 2005; Close, Ellis, Hooper, Glucksman, Jackson and Swift, 1999). The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 'Falls' guidelines (2004) were developed to improve management of falls, including their assessment and ways to prevent future falls. However, {{there is evidence of}} poor adherence to the guidelines (Sheldon et al., 2004). This research explores how falls are managed in EDs and the reasons why guidelines are not always followed. Methods: I undertook a detailed review of relevant research on the management of falls in EDs. Research also took place at two sites. Two particular research methods were employed; 1) observation research of healthcare professional and patient interaction, and 2) interviews with healthcare professionals. I observed the care of 27 patients and interviewed 30 health professionals. These methods were chosen in order to investigate factors influencing adherence. Results: Adherence to the guidelines was poor at both EDs. Various barriers and enablers (determinants of practice) influenced adherence, including: communication, complexity of patient care, services offered outside the ED, ED care processes (including education and busyness), variation in staff and cross-boundary care. Conclusions: A variety of factors influence adherence to the Falls guidelines within an ED, but {{it may be difficult to}} address all of them simultaneously and in the context of busy EDs. Simple interventions such as education and pro-formas are unlikely to have substantial effect on their own, although taking advantage of the influence of senior staff could enhance their effectiveness.

40|$|Background: Emergency {{department}} (ED) physicians {{provide care}} {{to patients with}} a wide range of prognoses, and must develop care plans that anticipate patient's survival. However, the tools available to guide care planning had limited data to support their use. There is a new concern to understand if palliative care (PC) should be offered in the ED and the Palliative Performance Scale (PPS), a screening tool used in other settings in PC, has been little used in the ED. Aim: The aim of this study is to assess the prognostic value of the PPS in predicting 1, 3 and 6 months survival in patients admitted through the ED. Design: This was a prospective, cohort study. Subjects and Methods: We evaluated 147 patients at the age of 35 years and more admitted through the ED of Minia University hospital from May 1, 2016 to June 31, 2016. Each patient's PPS score was evaluated initially in the ED, with follow-up assessments of survival at 1, 3, and 6 months. Results: Baseline PPS for the 147 patients was 50. The PPS score was a strong predictor of survival (Log-rank test of Kaplan–Meir P < 0. 0001). Patients with an initial PPS score of 40 or less were less likely to survive at 6 months. Conclusion: The PPS score may predict survival in patients admitted to the hospital through the ED. The ease of use holds promise that the use of the PPS in the <b>ED</b> may <b>help</b> <b>ED</b> physicians predict survival and plan for a better decision...|$|R
40|$|Teapot Dome is a Laramide fault-propagation fold {{developed}} over a west-vergent thrust that involves basement. In this thesis, I test {{the applicability of}} the kinematic trishear model and the mechanical elastic dislocation model to the Teapot Dome, Wyoming. The public domain dataset provided, consisting of 2 D and 3 D seismic, and a couple of wells with fracture data, is a typical example of a dataset with poor seismic imaging of the steeply dipping forelimb and lack of coverage in the footwall region. Additionally, the underlying thrust is not clearly imaged. Kinematic 2 D trishear inverse modelling was applied to reconstruct the geometry of the thrust, forelimb and footwall on eight cross sections along the anticline. Then, a 3 D structural model was constructed based on the trishear modelled cross-sections. This 3 D structural model was the input for elastic dislocation modelling (<b>ED).</b> <b>ED</b> <b>helped</b> validating and modifying the reconstructed anticlinal and thrust geometry. ED fracture prediction was validated using fracture data from two selected wells, one close to the thrust and another in the backlimb. Fractures in these wells are tensile, and the ED predicted maximum compressive stress (S 1) close to the wells, is subparallel to the wells fractures, which indicates that the ED model is a good proxy for the orientation of tensile fractures, and perhaps also shear fractures. Fracture intensity can be predicted using the ED maximum Coulomb shear stress (MCSS), which suggests more fracturing near the thrust and particularly in the footwall area. On cross section, trishear and ED proxies for fractures are similar, although the orientation of ED conjugate shear planes and trishear lines of no finite elongation (LNFE) is somewhat different, with the acute angle between LNFE being smaller than the one for the ED conjugate shear fractures. These results highlight the importance of using structural modelling techniques in discrete fracture networks (DFN) generation, and not just statistical or seismic-attributes based techniques...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Minor {{fractures}} (e. g. wrist, ankle) are {{risk factors}} for lower physical health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in seniors. Recent studies found that measures of frailty were associated with decreased physical and mental HRQoL in older people. As most people with minor fractures go to emergency departments (EDs) for treatment, measuring their frailty status in <b>EDs</b> may <b>help</b> stratify their level of HRQoL post-injury and provide them with appropriate health care and services after discharge. This study thus examines the HRQoL of seniors visiting EDs for minor fractures at 3 and 6  months after discharge, according to their frailty status. Methods This prospective sub-study was conducted within the larger Canadian Emergency Team Initiative (CETI) cohort. Independent seniors (≥ 65  years) were recruited in 7 Canadian EDs after treatment for various minor fractures. Frailty status in the ED phase was assessed by the Canadian Study of Health and Aging [...] Clinical Frailty Scale (CSHA-CFS). The SF- 12 questionnaire was completed at 3 and 6  months after ED discharge to ascertain HRQoL. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Linear mixed models were used to test for differences between frailty levels and HRQoL outcomes, controlling for confounding variables and repeated measures over time. Results The sample comprised 334 participants with minor fractures. Prevalence of frailty was as follows: 56. 6  % very fit-well; 32. 3  % well with treated comorbidities-apparently vulnerable; and 11. 1  % mildly-moderately frail. After adjusting for confounding variables, the frailest group showed significantly lower mean HRQoL scores than the fittest group on the physical scale at 3  months (49. 3 [*]±[*] 3. 7 vs 60. 9 [*]±[*] 2. 0) and 6  months (48. 7 [*]±[*] 3. 8 vs 61. 1 [*]±[*] 1. 8), {{as well as on}} the mental scale at 3  months (59. 5 [*]±[*] 4. 4 vs 69. 6 [*]±[*] 1. 9). Analyses exploring differences in proportion of patients with HRQoL[*]<[*] 50 / 100 between the three groups produced similar results. Conclusions Older adults with minor fractures who were frail had lower physical and mental HRQoL scores at 3 and 6  months after ED discharge than their fittest counterparts. Measuring the frailty status of older adults who suffered a minor fracture in <b>ED</b> might <b>help</b> clinical decision-making at the time of discharge by providing them with appropriate health care and services to improve their HRQoL in the following months...|$|R
