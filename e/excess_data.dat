40|$|Radiocarbon {{investigation}} of atmospheric PM 2. 5 aerosol synchronized with 14 CO 2 observations began in Debrecen {{in the winter}} of 2010. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the contemporary and fossil carbon fractions in the aerosol and to set them against the fossil CO 2 <b>excess</b> <b>data</b> referring to the same period. The mass of the collected PM 2. 5 mode on prebaked quartz filters was determined gravimetrically, while its total carbon mass was calculated from the pressure of CO 2 gas produced after the combustion of the filters. As a result of the applied sampling and preparation method, the stable, nonvolatile carbon forms were principally studied. 14 C measurements of the tiny aerosol bulk samples were performed using the EnvironMICADAS accelerator mass spectrometer at ATOMKI. The sample preparation method was tested using several blanks, standards, and real samples. Test results showed good reproducibility for the applied aerosol sample preparation and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) 14 C analyses. Atmospheric fossil CO 2 <b>excess</b> <b>data</b> were calculated according Levin et al. (2003), using the 14 C results of collected CO 2 samples measured by the gas proportional counting system at ATOMKI. Mass concentration of PM 10 involving the PM 2. 5 mode in the city air exceeded the daily average of 50 μg/m 3 (24 -hr limit value in the EU) several times in 2011, mainly during the winter. The results showed that recently derived carbon most likely from domestic wood burning was causing the elevated carbon mass concentration of PM 2. 5 in Debrecen at the time. In the course of the 1 -yr-long continuous and systematic comparison of fossil carbon mass concentration of PM 2. 5 mode and mole fraction of fossil excess of atmospheric CO 2, similar and synchronous trends were observed during the studied period in Debrecen...|$|E
40|$|The {{interstellar}} {{magnetic field}} (ISMF) near the heliosphere {{is a basic}} part of the solar neighborhood {{that can only be}} studied using polarized starlight. Results of an ongoing survey of polarized starlight are analyzed with the goal of linking the interstellar magnetic field that shapes the heliosphere to the nearby field in interstellar space. New results for the direction of the nearby ISMF, based on a merit function that utilizes polarization position angles, identify several magnetic components. The dominant interstellar field, B_pol, is aligned with the direction L,B= 36. 2, 49. 0 (+/- 16. 0) degrees and is within 8 degrees of the IBEX Ribbon ISMF direction. Stars tracing B_pol have the same mean distance as stars that do not trace B_pol, but show weaker polarizations consistent with lower column densities of polarizing grains. The variations in the polarization position angle directions indicate a low level of magnetic turbulence. B_pol is found after excluding polarizations that trace a separate magnetic structure that apparently is due to interstellar dust deflected around the heliosphere. Local interstellar cloud velocities relative to the LSR increase with the angles between the LSR velocities and ISMF, indicating that the kinematics of local interstellar material is ordered by the ISMF. Polarization and color <b>excess</b> <b>data</b> are consistent with an extension of Loop I to the solar vicinity. Polarizations are consistent with previous findings of more efficient grain alignment in low column density sightlines. Optical polarization and color <b>excess</b> <b>data</b> indicate the presence of nearby interstellar dust in the BICEP 2 field. Color excess E(B-V) indicates an optical extinction of A_V about 0. 59 mag in the BICEP 2 field, while the polarization data indicate that A_V is larger than 0. 09 mag.

Adapt frees the programmer from having to specify data placements, and it can use run-time information to find better placements than compilers.
