5|$|About 16hours {{before the}} storm moved through the Lesser Antilles, the {{government}} of Saint Lucia declared a tropical storm warning. Guadeloupe, Martinique, Dominica, St. Maarten, Saba, St. Eustatius, Puerto Rico and the U.S Virgin Islands issued tropical storm watches. Combined {{with the threat of}} Hurricane Charley, Bonnie forced the evacuation of 154oil platforms and 32oil rigs. The cease in production was equivalent to over 1.2million barrels of loss in crude oil, or 0.2% of the annual oil production <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Mexico. Natural gas reserves were also limited. The lack of gas production due to the storms was equivalent to 7.4% of the total daily production <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Mexico.|$|E
5|$|As Chris {{approached}} the Gulf Coast, at least 6,500people were evacuated from the Louisiana coast. Offshore evacuations were also completed, with many oil rig workers were taken off of rigs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Mexico.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Jeanne was one {{of three}} November hurricanes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Mexico; it was the first {{tropical}} cyclone to attain hurricane strength <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Mexico during November. The late season storm surprised maritime interests, and two barges broke free from towing vessels. Indirectly, the hurricane produced heavy precipitation that peaked at 23.28inches (591mm) in Key West. Minor beach erosion occurred along the Texas coast, where tides were two to four feet above normal; coastal flooding affected the state, which was heavily impacted by tropical cyclones in August and September. Jeanne caused no deaths.|$|E
