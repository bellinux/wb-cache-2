5|$|A mile (1.6km) {{north of}} NY417, NY16 reaches a bridge over Olean Creek, a {{tributary}} of the Allegheny. On the other side, it becomes a four-lane road with a divider as it approaches NY17, currently concurrent with I-86 pending the entire expressway's upgrade to Interstate Highway standards. A trumpet interchange provides access to I-86 and NY17 in both directions in the vicinity of Baldwin Heights. But NY16 runs parallel to the freeway and remains a four-lane route, although no longer divided, following the Olean valley. At Hinsdale it finally does cross I-86/NY17. Shortly afterwards, in the hamlet of Maplehurst, NY446, the former route of NY408, comes <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> east and terminates.|$|E
5|$|Activity in {{the central}} Pacific was also above average. Two {{tropical}} storms formed, as did several tropical depressions. A number of storms moved <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> east. With a total of nine tropical cyclones entering or forming there, this was the fourth highest number since satellite observations began. The first storm formed on June 1. The last storm dissipated December 21, which gives this season the latest known end. However, if December 6, the date the last storm crossed the dateline is taken to be the end, this season has the second latest end, behind the 1983 season and tied with the 1957 season.|$|E

5|$|After another {{supermarket}} {{strip to}} the east, a long, gentle divided {{bend in the}} road almost a mile long ends with an overpass where NY55 comes <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> west. It joins NY22 as the two routes, returning to two lanes, pass through the eastern fringe of the village of Pawling and then by Trinity-Pawling School. Past the village, the railroad tracks edge closer to the highway as NY22 enters the scenic Harlem Valley, which lends {{its name to the}} railroad line. The road curves more gently and takes longer straightaways, with lower density of residential and commercial development. Two miles from Pawling, the Appalachian Trail crosses the road next to the line's Appalachian Trail station. The flag stop allows hikers access to the nearby Pawling Nature Preserve.|$|E
5|$|After passing {{north of}} Havana, Cuba, Elena emerged into the Gulf of Mexico. At 12:00 UTC on August 29, Elena {{intensified}} into a Category 1 hurricane. Analysis of steering currents {{through the morning}} of August 30 suggested that Elena would continue on its northwestward track, striking the area between New Orleans, Louisiana, and Biloxi, Mississippi within 30 hours. Unexpectedly, a mid-to-upper-level trough of low pressure diving <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> northwest created a weakness in the easterly currents, allowing Elena to recurve and slow drastically in forward speed. Roughly 24 hours after attaining hurricane intensity, the storm abruptly turned east {{in response to the}} trough. Having defied initial forecasts, Hurricane Elena drifted on its new course toward the coast of northwest Florida. Forecasters now called for the trough to direct the hurricane across the Florida Peninsula and into the western Atlantic. However, the relatively weak trough moved rapidly, and instead of fully engaging Elena, its axis passed over the storm's center. Further, post-storm analysis of water vapor imagery suggested that the hurricane split the trough into two distinct segments.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of the 2010–11 season, Bostwick {{scored in}} a {{pre-season}} friendly against Hitchin Town, {{and made his}} first league appearance in the club's 2–2 draw with Macclesfield Town, playing the whole match. He scored his first goal {{of the season in}} the club's first ever Football League victory, in a 3–1 win against Stockport County, scoring with a shot from 30yards to double Stevenage's lead just before the interval. In November 2010, Bostwick provided two assists for Stevenage's goals in the club's 3–0 win away at local rivals Barnet. Bostwick scored his second goal of the 2010–11 season in Stevenage's 3–1 FA Cup win over Newcastle United in January 2011. Bostwick picked up a loose pass and rifled a shot that went in off the post from 25yards out to give Stevenage a two-goal lead. A month later, he scored his third goal of the season in a 4–0 win against Cheltenham Town, cutting <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> right and drilling a low shot across the face of goal and past the goalkeeper. Bostwick played a total of 51 matches during the 2010–11 season, scoring three goals. This included three appearances in the 2010–11 League Two play-offs following Stevenage's sixth-placed finish. Following a 3–0 aggregate victory over Accrington Stanley, Stevenage earned promotion to League One after a 1–0 win against Torquay United at Old Trafford on 28 May 2011, with Bostwick playing the whole match.|$|E
5|$|All Hallows Church is {{the oldest}} {{existing}} building in Wellingborough and dates from c.1160. The manor of Wellingborough belonged to Crowland Abbey Lincolnshire, from Saxon times and the monks probably built the original church. The earliest {{part of the building}} is the Norman doorway opening <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> later south porch. The church was enlarged with the addition of more side chapels {{and by the end of}} the 13th century had assumed more or less its present plan. The west tower, crowned with a graceful broach spire rising to , was completed about 1270, after which the chancel was rebuilt and given the east window twenty years later. The church was restored in 1861 by Edmund Francis Law. The 20th-century Church of St Mary was built by Ninian Comper.|$|E
5|$|Although Dutch forces {{conquered the}} {{towns and cities}} in Republican heartlands on Java and Sumatra, they could not control villages and the countryside.

The Dutch were expelled from the city for six hours but reinforcements were brought <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> nearby cities of Ambarawa and Semarang that afternoon. Indonesian fighters retreated at 12:00pm and the Dutch re-entered the city. The Indonesian attack, later known in Indonesia as Serangan Oemoem (new spelling: Serangan Umum '1 March General Offensive'), is commemorated by a large monument in Yogyakarta. A similar attack against Dutch troops in Surakarta was led by Lt. Col. Slamet Riyadi on 7 August the same year.|$|E

5|$|Amphibians {{might seem}} {{unlikely}} desert-dwellers, {{because of their}} need to keep their skins moist and their dependence on water for reproductive purposes. In fact, the few species that are found in this habitat have made some remarkable adaptations. Most of them are fossorial, spending the hot dry months aestivating in deep burrows. While there they shed their skins {{a number of times}} and retain the remnants around them as a waterproof cocoon to retain moisture. In the Sonoran Desert, Couch's spadefoot toad spends most of the year dormant in its burrow. Heavy rain is the trigger for emergence and the first male to find a suitable pool calls to attract others. Eggs are laid and the tadpoles grow rapidly as they must reach metamorphosis before the water evaporates. As the desert dries out, the adult toads rebury themselves. The juveniles stay on the surface for a while, feeding and growing, but soon dig themselves burrows. Few make it to adulthood. The water holding frog in Australia has a similar life cycle and may aestivate for as long as five years if no rain falls. The Desert rain frog of Namibia is nocturnal and survives because of the damp sea fogs that roll <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|Because their {{elliptical}} orbits frequently {{take them}} {{close to the}} giant planets, comets are subject to further gravitational perturbations. Short-period comets have a tendency for their aphelia to coincide with a giant planet's semi-major axis, with the JFCs being the largest group. It is clear that comets coming <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Oort cloud often have their orbits strongly influenced by the gravity of giant planets {{as a result of}} a close encounter. Jupiter is the source of the greatest perturbations, being more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. These perturbations can deflect long-period comets into shorter orbital periods.|$|E

5|$|Cirrocumulus clouds form in {{patches and}} cannot cast shadows. They {{commonly}} appear in regular, rippling patterns or in rows of clouds with clear areas between. Cirrocumulus are, like {{other members of}} the cumuliform and stratocumuliform categories, formed via convective processes. Significant growth of these patches indicates high-altitude instability and can signal the approach of poorer weather. The ice crystals in the bottoms of cirrocumulus clouds tend to be in the form of hexagonal cylinders. They are not solid, but instead tend to have stepped funnels coming <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ends. Towards the top of the cloud, these crystals have a tendency to clump together. These clouds do not last long, and they tend to change into cirrus because as the water vapor continues to deposit on the ice crystals, they eventually begin to fall, destroying the upward convection. The cloud then dissipates into cirrus. Cirrocumulus clouds come in four species which are common to all three genus-types that have limited-convective or stratocumuliform characteristics: stratiformis, lenticularis, castellanus, and floccus. They are iridescent when the constituent supercooled water droplets are all about the same size.|$|E
