25|$|Because {{the moving}} parts of the speaker must be of low mass (to {{accurately}} reproduce high-frequency sounds without being damped too much by inertia), voice coils are usually made as light weight as possible, making them delicate. Passing too much power through the coil can cause it to overheat (see ohmic heating). Voice coils wound with <b>flattened</b> <b>wire,</b> called ribbon-wire, provide a higher packing density in the magnetic gap than coils with round wire. Some coils are made with surface-sealed bobbin and collar materials so they may be immersed in a ferrofluid which assists in cooling the coil, by conducting heat away from the coil and into the magnet structure. Excessive input power at low frequencies can cause the coil to move beyond its normal limits, causing knocking and distortion.|$|E
5000|$|A hook-and-eye closure is a {{very simple}} and secure method of {{fastening}} garments together. It consists of a metal hook, commonly made of <b>flattened</b> <b>wire</b> bent to the required shape, and an eye (or [...] "eyelet") of the same material into which the hook fits.|$|E
50|$|Wire {{comes in}} solid core, stranded, or braided forms. Although usually {{circular}} in cross-section, wire {{can be made}} in square, hexagonal, flattened rectangular, or other cross-sections, either for decorative purposes, or for technical purposes such as high-efficiency voice coils in loudspeakers. Edge-wound coil springs, such as the Slinky toy, are made of special <b>flattened</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|E
50|$|Thick wire, of 16-gauge and heavier, {{is harder}} to bend and {{requires}} more expert handling. Hammering wire with a plastic or rawhide mallet will harden wire without changing its shape.

40|$|In this {{research}} the cross-sectional profile of <b>flattened</b> <b>wires</b> after flat rolling are calculated for different reductions. The empirical formulation, analytical formulation and numerical method {{have been used}} to predict the cross-sectional profile. Also, the theoretical results are compared with the experimental data. It has been found that the numerical method is able to predict the lateral spread, the width of contact area, and the curvature radius in all ranges of the reduction in height with a good accuracy, while the other methods exhibit a reasonable accuracy only for a limited range of height reduction. All results of the methods show that with increasing the reduction in height, the lateral spread and width of contact area are increased and the curvature radius is decreased. The appropriate ranges of height reductions for each method are recommended...|$|R
50|$|Tanks {{and light}} armored {{vehicles}} can generally <b>flatten</b> unmined <b>wire</b> obstacles, although the wire can become {{entangled in the}} tracks and immobilize the vehicle. This can also occur to wheeled vehicles once the wire becomes wrapped around the axle. Wire obstacles can also be breached by intense artillery shelling or Bangalore torpedoes.|$|R
5000|$|Modification of {{electrodes}} {{has developed}} beyond the size parameter. SECM-AFM probes {{can act as}} both a force sensor and electrode through the utilization of a flattened, etched metal wire coated by electrophoretic paint. In this system, the <b>flattened</b> <b>wire</b> acts as a flexible cantilever to measure the force against a sample (AFM) as the wire electrode measures the current (SECM). [...] Similarly, SECM functionality can be imparted into standard AFM probes by sputtering the surface with a conductive metal or by milling an insulated tip with a Focused Ion Beam (FIB). More recently, Electron Beam Lithography has been demonstrated to reproducibly generate SECM-AFM probes using silicon wafers.|$|E

40|$|In three-layered <b>flattened</b> <b>wire</b> ropes, {{which are}} common in mine haulage systems in coal mines, {{only part of the}} wires can be {{inspected}} by the visual method, so magnetic induction testing is employed as well. The project aimed at reducing inspection requirements without impairing the safety standard. Random sampling of <b>flattened</b> <b>wire</b> ropes have shown that this is possible, provided that fatigue and corrosion curves of the cable can be made comparable with the diagrams of magnetic induction tests. Monitoring of the strength reduction of these ropes must be possible throughout the whole rope life. The project focused on the following tasks: Assessment and description of the haulage systems and operating conditions (haulage equipment, mine climate, number of hoists per day, etc.); Inspection of the geometries of new and worn-out ropes and calculation of rupture forces and residual rupture forces; Modification of existing measuring and storage instruments, if possible in explosion-proof construction; Development of software for assessing the residual fracture force of haulage ropes.

5000|$|The emroidery {{styles of}} the Punjab region include the styles of Multani {{embroidery}} which features kalabatun [...] patterns using thin wires. This type of embroidery is also common {{in the rest of}} the Punjab region. Kalabatan surkh involves using gold wires on orange coloured and red silk. Kalabatan safed involves using silver wires on white material. There are two kinds of gold embroidery, one of a solid and rich kind called kar-chob and the other called tila-kar or kar-chikan utilising gold thread. The former is used for carpets and saddle cloths whereas the latter is used for dresses.

50|$|Modern reeds {{are made}} by placing <b>flattened</b> strips of <b>wire</b> (made of carbon or {{stainless}} steel) between two half round ribs of wood, and binding the whole together with tarred string. Historically reeds were made of reed or cane, however modern reeds are made of metal wires. John Kay in 1738 first used flattened iron or brass wire, and the change was quickly adopted. Previously the cane was split by pressing it against a spindle that had knives radiating out {{of it at the}} appropriate distance apart. The split cane was then bound between the ribs of wood {{in the same manner as}} the wire is now.|$|R
40|$|Surface-enhanced Raman {{spectroscopy}} (SERS) substrates manufactured using complex nano-patterning {{techniques have}} become the norm. However, their cost of manufacture makes them unaffordable to incorporate into most biosensors. The technique shown in this paper is low-cost, reliable and highly sensitive. Chemical etching of solid Ag metal was used to produce simple, yet robust SERS substrates with broadband characteristics. Etching with ammonium hydroxide (NH 4 OH) and nitric acid (HNO 3) helped obtain roughened Ag SERS substrates. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and interferometry were used to visualize and quantify surface roughness. <b>Flattened</b> Ag <b>wires</b> had inherent, but non-uniform roughness having peaks and valleys in the microscale. NH 4 OH treatment removed dirt and smoothened the surface, while HNO 3 treatment produced a flake-like morphology with visibly more surface roughness features on Ag metal. SERS efficacy was tested using 4 -methylbenzenethiol (MBT). The best SERS enhancement for 1 mM MBT was observed for Ag metal etched for 30 s in NH 4 OH followed by 10 s in HNO 3. Further, MBT could be quantified with detection limits of 1 pM and 100 µM, respectively, using 514 nm and 1064 nm Raman spectrometers. Thus, a rapid and less energy intensive method for producing solid Ag SERS substrate and its efficacy in analyte sensing was demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. An {{effective}} and efficient production method of narrow and thin strips made of steel, non-ferrous metals and their alloys is <b>wire</b> <b>flattening</b> in a ball rolling mill. In this device cylindrical rollers have been replaced with balls of diameter ca. 15 mm. Proper selection of deformation process parameters enables to obtain strips with the required geometrical characteristics. Experimental planning method was applied to evaluate the influence of flattening process technological parameters on strip geometrical features. Statistical analysis enabled to determine mathematical models of stainless steel 5 XCrNi 18 - 10 strips flattening. It was established that strip widening depends on ball roughness, draft applied, relation of wire diameter to ball diameter, back-tension stress. Strips flatness depends on draft applied. It was observed that strips feature uniform thickness over their width, parallel flat surfaces, narrow dimensional tolerance, high quality surface and naturally rounded edges...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the design and}} testing of tension control prototype systems to minimise these tension variations, which includes a fluidic muscle powered take up arm, a fluidic muscle wire accumulator and felt pad. First the model and their limitations for existing tensioning systems are identified. Then, they are theoretically analysed in simulations. The simulation {{results show that the}} acceleration and deceleration of the wire due to the changing wire path length causes a cyclic tension fluctuation. An online tension sensor verified the predictions of the model. The key for a successful design is to remove tension variations. We propose to add a <b>wire</b> <b>flattening</b> machine which includes an accumulator and tensioning device, and replace the conventional pneumatic cylinder powering the accumulator with a fluidic muscle. The simulation shows that the new prototype system almost doubles the winding speed with a tolerable tension fluctuation...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we have {{discussed}} the selected problems of microstructure development during the whole manufacturing process, i. e. continuous casting, thermomechanical processing, and cold metal forming of the microalloyed steels wires. In the investigated steels, the microstructure development was controlled by the history of deformation and by the effects of microalloying elements, mostly Nb, Ti, and B. It has been concluded that obtained in the ultrafine grained microalloyed steel wires mechanical properties were first of all resulting from specific structural composition and grain refinement. Additionally, it has been proven that austenite grain refinement, that increases nucleation rate during the austenite-to-ferrite phase transformation, {{as a result of}} the thermomechanical processing, are very beneficial from point of view of the final mechanical properties. This problem starts to be very important when the microalloyed steel products are subjected to severe plastic deformation, as it has been shown discussed in the present work for combined processes of wire drawing and <b>wire</b> <b>flattening...</b>|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} styles of monocle. The first style {{consists}} of a simple loop of metal with a lens which was slotted into the eye orbit. These were the first monocles worn in England and could be found from the 1830s onwards. The second style, which {{was developed in the}} 1890s, was the most elaborate, consisting of a frame with a raised edge-like extension known as the gallery. The gallery was designed to help secure the monocle in place by raising it out of the eye's orbit slightly, so that the eyelashes would not jar it. Monocles with galleries were often the most expensive. The very wealthy would have the frames custom-made to fit their eye sockets. A sub-category of the galleried monocle was the [...] "sprung gallery", where the gallery was replaced by an incomplete circle of <b>flattened,</b> ridged <b>wire</b> supported by three posts. The ends were pulled together, the monocle was placed in the eye orbit, and the ends released, causing the gallery to spring out and keep the monocle in place.The third style of monocle was frameless. This consisted of a cut piece of glass, with a serrated edge to provide a grip and sometimes a hole drilled into one side for a cord. Often the frameless monocle had no cord and would be worn freely. This style was popular {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century as the lens could be cut to fit any shape eye orbit inexpensively, without the cost of a customized frame.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Carrington had adopted, and was {{cultivating}} {{with his}} usual felicity of treatment, a ‘second subject’ at that juncture of peculiar interest and importance. While his new observatory was in course of construction, he devoted some of his spare time to examining the drawings and records of sun-spots in possession of the Astronomical Society, and was much struck with the need and scarcity of systematic solar observations. Sabine's and Wolf's discovery of the coincidence between the magnetic and sunspot periods had just then been announced, and he believed {{he should be able}} to take advantage of the pre-occupation or inability of other observers to appropriate to himself, by ‘close and methodical research,’ the next ensuing eleven-year cycle. He accordingly resolved to devote his daylight energies to the sun, while reserving his nights for the stars. Solar physics as a whole, however, he prudently excluded from his field of view. He limited his task to fixing the true period of the sun's rotation (of which curiously discrepant values had been obtained), to tracing the laws of distribution of maculæ, and investigating the existence of permanent surface-currents. Adequately to compass these ends, new devices of observation, reduction, and comparison were required. Leaving photography to his successors as too undeveloped for immediate use, he chose a method founded on the idea of making the solar disc its own circular micrometer. An image of the sun was thrown upon a screen placed at such a distance from the eyepiece of the 4½-inch equatoreal as to give to the disc a diameter of 12 to 14 inches. In the focus of the telescope, which was firmly clamped, two bars of <b>flattened</b> gold <b>wire</b> were fastened at right angles to each other, and inclined about 45° on either side of the meridian. Then, as the inverted image traversed the screen, the instants of contact with the wires of the sun's limbs and of the spot-nucleus to be measured were severally noted, when an easy calculation gave its heliocentric position (ib. xiv. 153).|$|R
