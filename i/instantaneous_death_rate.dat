40|$|Context: Shooting is used {{to reduce}} the {{abundance}} of kangaroo (Macropus sp.) populations in many peri-urban areas in Australia, but there is uncertainty surrounding the animal welfare outcomes of this practice. Aim: We assessed the animal welfare outcomes of night shooting for peri-urban eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus). We quantified the duration of stress for: (1) shot animals; (2) euthanased pouch young; and (3) other animals in the same social group. Methods: An independent observer collected thermal imagery data, enabling four key animal welfare parameters to be quantified: <b>instantaneous</b> <b>death</b> <b>rate,</b> median time to death, wounding rate and flight duration of conspecifics. The duration between pouch removal and insensibility was recorded for pouch young. Post-mortem data were recorded to confirm the location and extent of pathology from shooting.

40|$|Context Helicopter {{shooting}} {{is a common}} and effective tool for reducing overabundant wildlife populations. However, there is little quantitative information on the humaneness of the method, leading to uncertainty in wildlife-management policy. There is, subsequently, a need for an improved understanding of the welfare implications of helicopter shooting. Aim A study was undertaken to infer the humaneness of helicopter shooting for a case study species, the feral dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius). Methods Seven post-mortem studies (n≤ 715) and one ante-mortem study (n≤ 192) were undertaken during routine helicopter shooting programs of free-ranging camels. In these studies, we measured four animal-welfare parameters to allow inference on the humaneness of the technique. These parameters were time to death, <b>instantaneous</b> <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> (proportion of animals for which time to death≤ 0), wounding rate and location of bullet-wound tract. We also modelled these welfare variables against hypothesised explanatory variables to assist improvement of future programs. Key results The mean wounding rate was 0. 4 %, and the killing efficacy of the technique was 99. 6 %. Mean time to death was 4 s, and mean <b>instantaneous</b> <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> was 83 %. Each animal displayed a mean 2. 4 bullet-wound tracts, with 75 %, 63 % and 35 % of animals shot {{at least once in}} the thorax, cranium and cervical spine, respectively. Regression analysis revealed that the identity of the shooter {{and the nature of the}} local vegetation were the most important factors associated with an animal experiencing an inferred instantaneous death or not. Conclusions Helicopter shooting of feral camels produces a very low wounding rate and rapid time to death. Shooter identity is the most important consideration for determining animal-welfare outcomes. Improvements to the humaneness of programs can be made by increasing the rigour of shooter selection and training. Implications Wildlife killing methods must be demonstrated to be humane to receive public support; however, few shooting methods are objectively examined. Helicopter shooting can be independently examined and operators assessed. Adoption of this examination template may allow continual improvement by industry as well as increasing societal acceptance of helicopter shooting...|$|E
40|$|Context: Helicopter {{shooting}} {{is an effective}} tool for reducing feral horse (Equus caballus) populations that are considered overabundant. However, this tool has been less commonly used in recent years {{because of concerns about}} animal-welfare outcomes, which have not previously been quantified. Aims: The aims of the present study were to assess the helicopter shooting of feral horses to determine (1) the duration of stress, (2) the frequency of adverse animal-welfare events and (3) the influence of explanatory variables in determining welfare outcomes. Methods: We quantified the welfare outcomes of three helicopter shooting programs in central Australia during 2013 and 2015. We conducted ante-mortem observations of 937 horses and post-mortem observations of 630 horses. We measured the following three parameters to estimate the duration of stress from pursuit and the mode of death: chase time (CT), time to death (TTD) and total time (TT; CT+TTD). We quantified the frequency of adverse animal-welfare events, namely <b>instantaneous</b> <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> (IDR; percentage of animals for which TTD was zero), the apparent frequency of non-fatal wounding, and the frequency of bullet-wound tracts in different anatomical locations. We investigated the role of explanatory variables in determining whether or not a horse had an inferred instantaneous death. Key results: For all horses, the median CT was 42 s, the median TTD was 0 s (median TTD for horses not killed instantaneously was 15 s), and median TT was 52 s. At least 1...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY. 1. Even at high {{population}} densities (300 – 2000 ind. 1 − 1), {{only one}} of five small cladoceran species (adult body length 3 ̆c 1 mm) significantly suppressed population growth of the rotifer Keratella cochlearis through interference (encounter) competition. At 500 ind. H, adults of D. ambigua (0. 96 mm body length) imposed an <b>instantaneous</b> per capita <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> of 0. 21 day− 1 on this rotifer. These short‐term experiments may have underestimated cladoceran interference because newborn rotifers were rarely present. 2. Newborn rotifers (3 ̆c 12 h old) were much more susceptible than adult rotifers (3 ̆e 24 h old) to interference from Ceriodaphnia dubia. All of the small cladoceran species tested were very much less likely than large Daphnia (body lengths 3 ̆e 1. 2 mm) to interfere with K. cochlearis, but perhaps at high population densities they could suppress population growth of susceptible rotifer species by damaging, and possibly eating, relatively small and soft‐bodied newborn individuals. 3. K. cochlearis of the tecta form, without a posterior spine, produced offspring of the typica form, with a posterior spine, {{in the presence of}} C. dubia. This developmental response is stimulated by at least several, and possibly all, cladocerans and probably reduces the susceptibility of the rotifer to cladoceran interference.

40|$|Shooting {{is widely}} used to reduce the abundances of {{terrestrial}} wildlife populations, but there is concern about the animal welfare outcomes ('humaneness') of these programmes. Management agencies require methods for assessing the animal welfare outcomes of terrestrial wildlife shooting programmes. We identified four key issues in previous studies assessing the animal welfare outcomes of shooting programmes: (i) biased sampling strategies; (ii) no direct ante mortem observations; (iii) absence of quantifiable parameters for benchmarking; and (iv) no evaluation of explanatory variables that may cause adverse welfare outcomes. We used methods that address these issues to assess the welfare outcomes of a European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) shooting programme in south-eastern Australia. An independent observer collected ante mortem (distance, timing and outcome of each shot fired) and post mortem (locations of bullet wounds) data. The ante mortem data were used to estimate three critical animal welfare parameters: apparent time to death (ATTD); <b>instantaneous</b> <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> (IDR); and wounding rate (WR). The post mortem data were {{used to evaluate the}} location of bullet wounds relative to the Australian national standard operating procedure (SOP). For rabbits, the mean IDR was 0. 60, ATTD was 12 s and WR was 0. 12. A large proportion of rabbits (0. 75) were shot in the cranium or thorax, as required by the SOP. Logistic regression indicated that the proportion of rabbits wounded and missed increased with shooting distance. Hence, reducing shooting distances would increase the humaneness of European rabbit shooting programmes. Our approach enables the animal welfare outcomes of terrestrial shooting programmes to be independently quantified...|$|E

Based upon data from 93 hospitals and 205, 000 admissions, we used a multiple regression model to adjust the hospitals crude <b>death</b> <b>rate.</b> The adjustment process used age, origin of patient from the emergency department or nursing home, and a hospital case mix index based on DRGs (diagnostic related groups). Before adjustment, hospital <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> ranged from 0. 3 to 5. 8 per 100 admissions.
