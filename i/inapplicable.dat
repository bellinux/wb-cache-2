5|$|Section 25 {{was not a}} more {{significant}} source of criminal appeals in large part becauseas Barron v. Baltimore (1833) heldthe Bill of Rights (including its criminal procedure provisions) was viewed as <b>inapplicable</b> to the state governments. This continued until the incorporation of the Bill of Rights after {{the adoption of the}} Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} {{conducted by}} the office of the Prosecutors General of the Soviet Union (1990–1991) and the Russian Federation (1991–2004) confirmed Soviet responsibility for the massacres but refused to classify this action as a war crime or an act of genocide. The investigation was closed {{on the grounds that the}} perpetrators of the atrocity were already dead, and since the Russian government would not classify the dead as victims of the Great Purge, formal posthumous rehabilitation was deemed <b>inapplicable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Federal DUI law {{differs from}} New Jersey law {{in that there}} are no {{mandatory}} minimum jail sentences, irrespective of the number of previous DUI convictions, and plea bargaining is allowed. A federal DUI conviction will result in unexpungeable criminal record. Federal courts cannot suspend a driver's license, but may notify the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission of a DUI conviction. In federal enclaves that are under the jurisdiction of other federal departments (e.g. Fish and Wildlife Service), it is unclear if drunk driving could be prosecuted since the Assimilative Crimes Act is <b>inapplicable,</b> and there is no federal law defining DUI on those properties.|$|E
5|$|The 1986 SQL {{standard}} basically adopted Codd's proposal {{after an}} implementation prototype in IBM System R. Although Don Chamberlin recognized nulls (alongside duplicate rows) {{as one of}} the most controversial features of SQL, he defended the design of Nulls in SQL invoking the pragmatic arguments that it was the least expensive form of system support for missing information, saving the programmer from many duplicative application-level checks (see semipredicate problem) while at the same time providing the database designer with the option not to use Nulls if he so desires; for example, in order to avoid well known anomalies (discussed in the semantics section of this article). Chamberlin also argued that besides providing some missing-value functionality, practical experience with Nulls also led to other language features which rely on Nulls, like certain grouping constructs and outer joins. Finally, he argued that in practice Nulls also end up being used as a quick way to patch an existing schema when it needs to evolve beyond its original intent, coding not for missing but rather for <b>inapplicable</b> information; for example, a database that quickly needs to support electric cars while having a miles-per-gallon column.|$|E
5|$|Francium is also {{predicted}} {{to show some}} differences due to its high atomic weight, causing its electrons to travel at considerable fractions {{of the speed of}} light and thus making relativistic effects more prominent. In contrast to the trend of decreasing electronegativities and ionisation energies of the alkali metals, francium's electronegativity and ionisation energy are {{predicted to}} be higher than caesium's due to the relativistic stabilisation of the 7s electrons; also, its atomic radius is expected to be abnormally low. Thus, contrary to expectation, caesium is the most reactive of the alkali metals, not francium. All known physical properties of francium also deviate from the clear trends going from lithium to caesium, such as the first ionisation energy, electron affinity, and anion polarisability, though due to the paucity of known data about francium many sources give extrapolated values, ignoring that relativistic effects make the trend from lithium to caesium become <b>inapplicable</b> at francium. Some of the few properties of francium that have been predicted taking relativity into account are the electron affinity (47.2 kJ/mol) and the enthalpy of dissociation of the Fr2 molecule (42.1 kJ/mol). The CsFr molecule is polarised as Cs+Fr−, showing that the 7s subshell of francium is much more strongly affected by relativistic effects than the 6s subshell of caesium. Additionally, francium superoxide (FrO2) is expected to have significant covalent character, unlike the other alkali metal superoxides, because of bonding contributions from the 6p electrons of francium.|$|E
25|$|The High Court {{interpreted}} the term parent to mean father. The equality of rights granted to both parents under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1961 was held <b>inapplicable</b> on the Muslim father.|$|E
25|$|That {{self-determination}} {{is further}} rendered <b>inapplicable</b> {{due to the}} disruption of the territorial integrity of Argentina that began with a forceful removal of its authorities in the islands in 1833, thus there is a failure to comply with an explicit requirement of UN Resolution 1514 (XV).|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} {{limitations}} {{to the rule}} of necessity. One suggested limitation is that the rule is <b>inapplicable</b> if the disqualification of a member will still leave a quorum of an administrative agency capable of acting. Another is that the rule of necessity will not justify an adjudicator sitting where actual bias can be shown.|$|E
25|$|Passed on 17 July 1973, {{the first}} amended {{was made to}} the Article 47 of the constitution. The {{amendment}} inserted an additional clause, Article 47(3) that allowed punishment and prosecution of war criminals under international law. A new Article 47A was also added, which specified that certain fundamental rights will be <b>inapplicable</b> in those cases.|$|E
25|$|Scherk {{argued that}} Wilko was <b>inapplicable.</b> He relied on The Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., a {{case from the}} {{previous}} year in which the Supreme Court had held valid a forum selection clause requiring the dispute to be adjudicated in an English court. Further, as a foreign national, he argued that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over him.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years of the reign of Alexander II, Pobedonostsev maintained, though keeping aloof from the Slavophiles, that Western {{institutions}} were radically bad in themselves and totally <b>inapplicable</b> to Russia since they had no roots in Russian history and culture and did not correspond to the spirit of Russian people. In that period, he contributed several papers to Alexander Herzen's radical periodical Voices from Russia.|$|E
25|$|Lawrence {{wrote down}} some of his {{theories}} while ill and unable to fight the Turks in his book The Seven Pillars of Wisdom. There, he reviews von Clausewitz and other theorists of war, and finds their writings <b>inapplicable</b> to his situation. The Arabs could not defeat the Turks in pitched battle since they were individualistic warriors not disciplined soldiers used to fight in large formations.|$|E
25|$|Torah mi-Sinai ("Torah From Sinai"): Modern Orthodoxy, in {{line with}} the rest of Orthodoxy, holds that Jewish law is Divine in origin, and as such, no {{underlying}} principle may be compromised in accounting for changing political, social or economic conditions, whereas Conservative Judaism holds that Poskim should make use of literary and historical analysis in deciding Jewish law, and may reverse decisions of the Acharonim that are held to be <b>inapplicable</b> today.|$|E
25|$|Counsel for Drybones {{argued that}} the Crown failed to prove that Drybones was an Indian {{within the meaning of}} Section 2(g) of the Indian Act, which {{requires}} that Indian be a member of an Indian band; therefore, Drybones could not be convicted under sections 94(b) of the Indian Act. It was also argued that since there are no reserves in the Northwest territories, Section 94(b) of the Indian Act is <b>inapplicable</b> to such cases in the Northwest Territories.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{announced}} its decision in July, {{near the end}} of term. Harry Blackmun wrote for a five-justice majority that affirmed the First Circuit's holding that the statutory claims were arbitrable and reversed it by holding the antitrust claims arbitrable as well. John Paul Stevens' lengthy dissent argued primarily that the arbitration clause was <b>inapplicable</b> to the dispute, and the precedent against arbitrating antitrust claims was far stronger than the majority represented it to be. Justice Lewis Powell took no part in the case.|$|E
25|$|The 39th Amendment attempted, {{among other}} provisions, to legitimize the {{election}} of Indira Gandhi in 1971. Article 329A put the elections of the Prime Minister and Lok Sabha Speaker outside {{the purview of the}} judiciary and provided for determination of disputes concerning their elections by an authority to be set up by a Parliamentary law. The Supreme Court struck down clauses (4) and (5) of the article 329A, which made the existing election law <b>inapplicable</b> to the Prime Minister's and Speaker's election, and declared the pending proceedings in respect of such elections null and void.|$|E
25|$|Reform Judaism {{has made}} greater {{alterations}} {{to the traditional}} service in accord with its more liberal theology including dropping references to traditional elements of Jewish eschatology such as a personal Messiah, a bodily resurrection of the dead, and others. The Hebrew portion of the service is substantially abbreviated and modernized and modern prayers substituted for traditional ones. In addition, in keeping with their view that the laws of Shabbat (including a traditional prohibition on playing instruments) are <b>inapplicable</b> to modern circumstances, Reform services often play instrumental or recorded music with prayers on the Jewish Sabbath. All Reform synagogues are Egalitarian with respect to gender roles.|$|E
25|$|Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44 (1996), was a United States Supreme Court case {{which held}} that Article One of the U.S. Constitution {{did not give}} the United States Congress the power to {{abrogate}} the sovereign immunity of the states that is further protected under the Eleventh Amendment. Such abrogation is permitted where {{it is necessary to}} enforce the rights of citizens guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment as per Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer 427 U.S. 445 (1976). The case also held that the doctrine of Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), which allows state officials to be sued in their official capacity for prospective injunctive relief, was <b>inapplicable</b> under these circumstances, because any remedy was limited to the one that Congress had provided.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Russia {{also joined}} the Rome Convention, the {{analogue}} of the Berne Convention for neighbouring rights. The adherence of Russia to the Rome Convention became effective on May 26, 2003. The Rome convention covered performances, phonograms, and broadcasts. For phonograms, it stipulated that phonograms {{produced by a}} national of a contracting state, or fixated in a contracting state, or published in a contracting state were covered, but allowed signatory countries to choose among the latter two (article 5). Russia chose to apply the criteria of nationality and publication, declaring the criterion of fixation as <b>inapplicable</b> in its adherence to the treaty. The Rome Convention is non-retroactive and applies only to phonograms created after and to performances or broadcasts that occurred after a country jointed the convention (article 20).|$|E
25|$|On 14 March 2002, {{a number}} of Falun Gong {{practitioners}} {{were engaged in a}} peaceful demonstration outside the main entrance to the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Their number varied from 4 to 16 over time, hence rendering the statutory restriction scheme <b>inapplicable.</b> It was still possible to access the Liaison Office via a vehicular driveway. After warnings were ignored by the demonstrators, the superintendent in charge ordered his officers to arrest and remove them. The demonstrators resisted arrest but were eventually forcibly removed using heavy-handed tactics and loaded on board police vehicles. When they arrived at the police station, female demonstrators refused to leave the vehicles. Police officers took action to carry them off the vehicles but the demonstrators resisted and assaulted the officers.|$|E
25|$|To {{the extent}} that the {{exhaustion}} doctrine is grounded in considerations of public policy, and to {{the extent that}} the interests of the public and third parties (such as Quanta in the Quanta case) are to be considered as well as those of the contracting parties, the courts may be more likely to place limits on whether the parties can by contract make the doctrine <b>inapplicable</b> to the goods that are the subject of their contract. On the other hand, if the policy of the exhaustion doctrine is seen merely as a rule to make sure that downstream purchasers get fair notice that their use of goods whose purchase they are considering will be restricted, courts may be more likely to uphold such restrictions unless they collide with other policies, such as those of competition or antitrust law.|$|E
25|$|Germany {{extends the}} non-applicability {{of the rule}} of the shorter term to all members of the European Economic Area in §120 of its Urheberrechtsgesetz. It also does not apply the {{comparison}} of terms to U.S. works. In a case decided on October 7, 2003 by the Oberlandesgericht of Hesse in Frankfurt am Main, the court ruled that a U.S. work that had fallen in the public domain in the U.S. was still copyrighted in Germany. The court considered the rule of the shorter term <b>inapplicable</b> because of the bilateral copyright treaty between Germany and the United States, which had become effective on January 15, 1892 and which was still in effect. That treaty did not contain a rule of the shorter term, but just stated that works of either country were copyrighted in the other country by the other country's laws.|$|E
25|$|According to Ahmadi Muslim belief, Jihad can {{be divided}} into three categories: Jihad al-Akbar (Greater Jihad) is that against the self and refers to striving against one's low desires such as anger, lust and hatred; Jihad al-Kabīr (Great Jihad) refers to the {{peaceful}} propagation of Islam, with special emphasis on spreading the true message of Islam by the pen; Jihad al-Asghar (Smaller Jihad) is an armed struggle only to be resorted to in self-defence under situations of extreme religious persecution whilst not being able to follow one's fundamental religious beliefs, and even then only under the direct instruction of the Caliph. Ahmadi Muslims point out that as per Islamic prophecy, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad rendered Jihad in its military form as <b>inapplicable</b> in the present age as Islam, as a religion, is not being attacked militarily but through literature and other media, and therefore the response should be likewise. They believe that the answer of hate should be given by love.|$|E
25|$|The same year, on December 5, the Bucharest Court of Appeals {{overturned}} Antonescu's {{conviction for}} certain crimes against peace, {{on the grounds}} that the objective conditions of 1940 justified a preventive war against the Soviet Union, which would make Article 3 of the 1933 Convention for the Definition of Aggression <b>inapplicable</b> in his case (as well as in those of Alexianu, Constantin Pantazi, Constantin Vasiliu, Sima and various Iron Guard politicians). This act raised official protests in Moldova, the independent state formed in Bessarabia upon the breakup of the Soviet Union, and in Russia, the Soviet successor state, as well as criticism by historians of the Holocaust. The Court of Appeals decision was overturned by the Romanian Supreme Court in May 2008. The same year, Maria Antonescu's collateral inheritors advanced a claim on a Predeal villa belonging to the couple, but a Brașov tribunal rejected their request, citing laws which confiscated the property of war criminals.|$|E
25|$|Some studies {{indicate}} that ectomycorrhizal fungi might {{be at odds with}} the general latitudinal gradient of diversity (LGD). Data sets, free from inconclusive fruit-body surveys and largely relying on more accurate sequencing and microarray technologies, indicate that EcM fungi may be at enhanced diversity in the temperate zone. This implies that many of the causal mechanisms proposed to explain the LGD pattern might be <b>inapplicable,</b> or in need of modification, in reference to EcM. Though this relationship is far from certain, there exist some hypotheses to explain the plausibility of this phenomenon: 1) EcM fungi may have evolved at higher latitudes with Pinaceae hosts, and are subsequently inferior at competition in tropical climates, 2) host lineages might be more diverse in temperate conditions, and well developed soil and soil horizons in temperate regions allow for higher niche differentiation and species accumulation, and 3) tropical EcM hosts are more sparsely distributed, yielding small isolated forest islands that may reduce the population sizes and subsequent richness of EcM fungi.|$|E
25|$|While the Hasbro case {{considered}} {{a special case}} of the applicability of rule of the shorter term {{in the context of}} the UCC, the case of Capitol Records, Inc. v. Naxos of America, Inc. (4 N.Y.3d 540, 2nd Cir. 2005) had the occasion to consider the matter under Berne Convention. In this case, Capitol Records claimed copyright on old British sound recordings from the 1930s, on which the copyright in the United Kingdom had expired in the late 1980s. Naxos Records, which also and in competition to Capitol distributed restored versions of these recordings, challenged this copyright claim. Sound recordings are a special case because pre-1972 sound recordings in the United States are not covered by federal law but by state law. The court concluded that since federal law did not apply, and because nothing in the Berne Convention (which is <b>inapplicable</b> to sound recordings anyway) or the Rome Convention usurped the State of New York's law, the works were under copyright pursuant to New York common lawwhile the Uruguay Round Agreements Act and US statutes did not, and had never, offered protection to these works; the fact that they were not under copyright in the UK as of 1996 was completely irrelevant.|$|E
25|$|Clenora Hudson-Weems's Africana womanism {{arose from}} a {{nationalist}} Africana studies concept. In Africana Womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves, Hudson-Weems explores {{the limitations of}} feminist theory and explains the ideas and activism of different African women who have contributed to womanist theory. At its core, Africana womanism rejects feminism because it is {{set up in a}} way as to promote the issues of white women over the issues of Black women. Hudson-Weems argues that feminism will never be okay for black women due to the implications of slavery and prejudice. She further asserts that the relationship between a Black man and a Black woman is significantly different from the relationship between a White man and a White woman, because the white woman battles the white man for subjugating her, but the black women battles all oppressive forces that subjugate her, her children, and the black man. She further asserts that racism forced African-American men and African-American women to assume unconventional gender roles. In this context, the desire of mainstream feminism to dismantle traditional gender roles becomes <b>inapplicable</b> to the black experience. Unlike womanism, Africana womanism is an ideology designed specifically with women of African descent in mind. It is grounded in African culture and focuses on the unique struggles, needs, and desires of African women. Based on this reasoning, Africana Womanism posits race- and class-based oppression as far more significant than gender-based oppression.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{implied term}} of an {{employment}} contract {{that may be}} broken is mutual trust and confidence. In Johnson v Unisys Ltd the House of Lords held by 4 to 1 that damages for breach of mutual trust and confidence {{at the point of}} dismissal should not exceed the statutory limit on unfair dismissal claims, because otherwise the statutory limits would be undermined. This limit was £74,200 in 2013, though the median award was merely £4,560. This meant a computer worker who developed a psychiatric illness following a wrongful dismissal procedure could not claim his total economic losses, which would have amounted to £400,000 in damages. However, if the breach occurs while the employment relationship subsists, that limit is <b>inapplicable.</b> So in Eastwood v Magnox Electric plc, a school teacher who also suffered psychiatric injury, but as a result of harassment and victimisation while he still worked, could claim for a full measure of damages for the breach of mutual trust and confidence. In any event the limit is merely implied and depends on construction of the contract, so that it may be opted out of by express words providing for a higher sum, for example, by expressly providing for a disciplinary procedure. A notable absence of an implied term at common law historically (i.e. before the development of mutual trust and confidence) was that an employer would have to give any good reasons for a dismissal. This was recommended to be changed in the Donovan Report 1968, and it launched the present system of unfair dismissal.|$|E

500|$|Berry Feld, {{professor}} at University of Minnesota Law School, wrote: [...] "the Court's decision... treated juveniles as the functional equals of adults during interrogation. Over the past quarter-century, developmental psychological research consistently has emphasized adolescents' inability to understand or exercise Miranda rights". Paul Holland, {{professor at}} Seattle University School of Law, wrote that [...] "the assumptions Justice Kennedy made in Alvarado are <b>inapplicable</b> to the schoolhouse context... considering {{the age of}} a student-suspect questioned at school, would not present a significant risk of compromising the clarity the Court has sought to provide law enforcement.

500|$|The respondent, the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO), {{argued that}} the English courts had no {{jurisdiction}} over the case, since the Crown is divisible amongst its territories, and the BIOT had its own courts. According to the FCO, Magna Carta, as a British constitutional document, was <b>inapplicable</b> to the Chagos Islands. They also maintained that [...] "make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Territory" [...] gave the Commissioner a wide enough jurisdiction {{to account for the}} order forcibly removing the Chagossians, and that the court could not decide {{in such a way as}} to force the government to break its treaty with the United States.|$|E
500|$|Most {{often the}} {{privilege}} was applied {{in cases of}} imprisonment in debtors' prisons. In 1870, both imprisonment for debt and the privilege in relation to freedom from arrest for bankruptcy were abolished, {{and as a result}} the freedom became extremely limited in practical application. Now, civil proceedings involve arrests only when an individual disobeys a court order. Since 1945, the privilege of freedom from arrest in civil cases has arisen in only two cases: Stourton v Stourton (1963) and Peden International Transport, Moss Bros, The Rowe Veterinary Group and Barclays Bank plc v Lord Mancroft (1989). In the latter most recent case, the trial judge considered the privilege obsolete and <b>inapplicable,</b> and said in proceedings, [...] "the privilege did not apply—indeed... it is unthinkable in modern times that, in circumstances such as they are in this case, it should".|$|E
500|$|The team's {{goal was}} to make the game {{different}} from contemporaneous first-person shooters. The team ensured the game had its own style that would differentiate itself from other games. This was achieved by using a [...] "split-world aspect", which divided the game's into two areas, each with a different artstyle.

Both sides were inspired by futuristic films such as Blade Runner, Minority Report and Gattaca. In addition, the split-world concept applies to the gameplay. The Downzone enemies tend to be more aggressive and anti-agents, and some gameplay segments such as the breaching system are <b>inapplicable</b> in such areas.|$|E

500|$|Walker {{also sought}} to improve the state of student life and alumni {{relations}} by supporting {{the creation of a}} gymnasium, dormitories, and the Technology Club, which served to foster a stronger identity and loyalty among the largely commuter student body. He also won considerable praise from the student body by reducing the required time spent for recitation and preparation, limiting the faculty to examinations lasting no longer than three hours, expanding entrance examinations to other cities, starting a summer curriculum, and launching masters and doctoral graduate degree programs. These reforms were largely a response to Walker's on-going defense of the Institute and its curriculum from outside accusations of overwork, poor writing, <b>inapplicable</b> skills, and status as a [...] "mere" [...] trade school. Between 1881 and 1897, enrollments quadrupled from 302 to 1,198 students, annual degrees granted increased from 28 to 179, faculty appointments quadrupled from 38 to 156, and the endowment grew thirteenfold from $137,000 to $1,798,000 ($ to $ in 2016 dollars).|$|E
