40|$|In practice, {{operable}} façade elements (OFE’s) {{in office}} buildings {{are often not}} appropriate to use to gain control over the thermal environment and indoor air quality. This study was performed to provide the means for architects and façade designers to design better usable OFE’s and improve personal control over indoor air quality and thermal environment in the future. Therefore, aspects affecting the usability of OFE’s was investigated, followed by determination of requirements, the design of an OFE meeting these requirements {{and the development of}} a Design Guide. This was done by combining a literature survey, database analysis and context mapping study. The literature studied contained on the one hand very specific information about the use and physical aspects of operable windows and on the other hand more general information on operable windows was part of the greater whole. The database analyses presented that objections of roommates, draught and noise from outside the building revealing the most important reasons for not always being able to open a window when needed. Besides, open answers gave additional practical insight and it was found that the increase in roommates decreased the positive response to always being able to open the window when desired. Thus, mainly explicit and observable knowledge where provided by the literature survey and BBA database analysis. The context mapping study learned that direct communication with users helps to understand their tacit and latent needs, which helped to provide the means to improve OFE designs in the future. The eleven requirements for better usable OFE's are: User-friendly, Clear design intent, Effective, Supply <b>is</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> of sufficient quality, Fine-tuning capability/adjustable, Low noise ingress, (Mental) connection with outside, Proximal/ highly controllable by occupants, Robust, Parallel use of windowsill and window and Align design and management & security policy.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{fundamental}} human needs <b>is</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air.</b> It has been estimated that people spend comparatively much time in indoor premises. That creates an elevated need for high-quality ventilation systems in buildings. The ventilation airflow rate is recognised as the main parameter for measuring the indoor air quality. It has been shown that the ventilation airflow rates have effects on respiratory diseases, on “sick building syndrome” symptoms, on productivity and perceived air quality. Ventilation is necessary to remove indoor-generated pollutants by diluting these to an acceptable level. The choice of ventilation airflow rate is often based on norms or standards in which the airflow rate is determined based on epidemiological research and field or laboratory measurements. However, the determination of ventilation flow rate is far more complex. Indoor air quality in the occupied zone can be dependent of many factors such as outdoor air quality, airflow rate, indoor generation of pollutants, moisture content, thermal environment and how the air is supplied into the human occupied zone. One needs to acknowledge the importance of air distribution which clearly affects the comfort of occupants. To design a ventilation system which considers all aspects of room ventilation can only be achieved by computer modelling. The objective of this thesis is to investigate air diffusion, indoor air quality and comfort issues by CFD (computational fluid dynamics) modelling. The crucial part of the CFD modelling is to adopt BCs (boundary conditions) for a successful and accurate modelling procedure. Assessing the CFD simulations by validated BCs enabled constructing the ventilation system virtually and various system layouts were tested to meet given design criteria. In parallel, full-scale measurements were conducted to validate the diffuser models and the implemented simplified particle-settling model. Both the simulations and the measurements reveal the full complexity of air diffusion coupled with solid contaminants. The air supply method is an important factor for distribution of heat, air velocity and solid contaminants. The influence of air supply diffuser location, contaminant source location and air supply method was tested both numerically and by measurements to investigate the influence of different parameters on the efficiency of room ventilation. As example of this, the well-known displacement ventilation is not fully able to evacuate large 10 μm airborne particles from a room. Ventilation should control the conditions in the human breathing zone and therefore the ventilation efficiency is an important parameter. A properly designed ventilation system could use less fresh air to maintain an acceptable level of contaminant concentration in the human breathing zone. That is why complete mixing of air is not recommended as the ventilation efficiency is low and the necessary airflow rate is relatively high compared to other ventilation strategies. Especially buoyancy-driven airflows from heat sources {{are an important part of}} ventilation and should not be hampered by supply airflow from the diffusers. All the results revealed that CFD presently is the only reliable method for optimising a ventilation system considering the air diffusion and contaminant level in all locations of any kind of room. The last part of the thesis addresses the possibility to integrate the CFD modelling into a building design process where architectural space geometry, thermal simulations and diffuser BCs could be embedded into a normal building design project.
