5|$|Albert Balink, a Dutch journalist, {{began work}} on {{what was to become}} Pareh in 1934. Unlike The Teng Chun, the inexperienced Balink chose to target his film at Dutch audiences.

The Wongs donated their studio– an old tapioca flour factory– as well as filmmaking equipment. Meanwhile, much of the funding came from other backers. According to the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran, the money came from the cinema mogul Buse, while EYE Film Institute records indicate that the film was backed by the Centrale Commissie voor Emigratie en Kolonisatie van Inheemschen and meant to promote migration from Java to Sumatra.|$|E

5|$|By 2014, OR-7 {{had settled}} in the Rogue River {{watershed}} in the southern Cascade Range east of Medford, Oregon, with a mate. It is not known when the two wolves met, but DNA tests of fecal samples showed that she is related to wolves <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the eight packs in northeastern Oregon. In early 2015, officials designated the two adult wolves and their offspring as the Rogue Pack, the first wolf pack in western Oregon and the state's ninth overall since wolves returned to Oregon from Idaho in the 1990s. The batteries in OR-7's tracking collar expired in October 2015, and monitoring the pack since then has depended on trail cameras and live sightings. Meanwhile, other wolves have migrated into the mountainous cross-border region, and relatives of OR–7 have formed two packs in northern California.|$|E
