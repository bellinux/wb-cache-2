25|$|On 11 August 1978, Parker (who {{had been}} vaccinated against {{smallpox}} in 1966) fell ill; {{she had a}} headache and pains in <b>her</b> <b>muscles.</b> She developed spots that {{were thought to be}} a benign rash. On 20 August at 3pm, she was admitted to East Birmingham (now Heartlands) Hospital and a clinical diagnosis of Variola major, the most serious type of smallpox, was made by Professor Alasdair Geddes and Dr. Thomas Henry Flewett.|$|E
500|$|Callie {{inherited}} the mutation for {{a gene that}} causes 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, which impedes the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. While the former hormone causes the brain to become masculine, it is the latter that molds male genitals. When Callie reaches puberty, her testosterone levels increase significantly, resulting {{in the formation of}} a larger Adam's apple, the broadening of <b>her</b> <b>muscles,</b> the deepening of her voice, and the augmentation of her clitoris to resemble a penis. Doctors determine that Callie has the XY chromosomes of a male after inspecting Callie's genitalia. Callie's parents bring her to New York City to see Dr. Peter Luce, a foremost expert on hermaphroditism, who believes she should retain her female identity. Luce plans a gender reassignment surgery to make her a female. However, Callie knows that she is sexually attracted to females, and decides to run away to pursue a male identity. When Cal has a sexual relationship with the Japanese-American photographer Julie {{at the end of the}} book, he is able to love [...] "without the need to penetrate the object of his desire".|$|E
2500|$|Fussi and Paolillo also {{examined}} restored {{footage of the}} infamous 1958 Norma [...] "walkout" [...] in Rome, which led to harsh criticism of Callas as a temperamental superstar. By applying spectrographic analysis to that footage, the researchers observed her voice was tired and she lacked control. She really did have the bronchitis and tracheitis she claimed, and the dermatomyositis was already causing <b>her</b> <b>muscles</b> to deteriorate.|$|E
50|$|Her {{physiology}} and <b>her</b> <b>muscle</b> tissue {{have been studied}} by doctors at the Montreal Neurological Institute and at McGill University's Montreal Chest Institute. <b>Her</b> <b>muscle</b> fibers at age 91 {{were found to be}} remarkably lacking in the mitochondrial decay expected in someone over 65.|$|R
50|$|Chizevsky-Nicholls gave {{up much of}} <b>her</b> <b>muscle</b> {{gains and}} began {{competing}} in fitness competitions in 2001, but with only limited success.|$|R
50|$|Chia was {{diagnosed}} with peroneal muscular atrophy when she was 15. She gradually had to depend on crutches, and later wheelchairs, as <b>her</b> <b>muscle</b> tissue progressively weakened. She {{has not been able}} to stand for 20 years and her hands have grown limp.|$|R
2500|$|Prompted by {{her loss}} of {{consciousness}} during Rhythm 5, Abramović devised the two-part Rhythm 2 to incorporate a state of unconsciousness in a performance. She performed the work at the Gallery of Contemporary Art in Zagreb, in 1974. In Part I, which had a duration of 50 minutes, she ingested a medication she describes as 'given to {{patients who suffer from}} catatonia, to force them to change the positions of their bodies.' The medication caused <b>her</b> <b>muscles</b> to contract violently, and she lost complete control over her body, while remaining aware of what was going on. After a ten-minute break, she took a second medication 'given to schizophrenic patients with violent behavior disorders to calm them down.' The performance ended after five hours, when the medication wore off.|$|E

50|$|Pendleton trains with weights {{six times}} a week. She uses lots of free weights with {{relative}} few machines. She uses a lot powerlifting exercises such as squats, deadlifts, shoulder presses and so on to make <b>her</b> <b>muscle</b> tone bigger in less time and become stronger.|$|R
5000|$|Suzanne Davis as Arlee Hicks / Buff, {{one of the}} {{students}} at the Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, she is a friendly person, whose mutation increases <b>her</b> <b>muscle</b> mass and strength. She is insecure about her new physique and wears loose clothing to cover it up.|$|R
40|$|Dermatomyositis was {{diagnosed}} on clinical and muscle histological criteria in a 42 -year-old woman. Despite treatment, the patient complained of deterioration of <b>her</b> <b>muscle</b> condition. Since <b>her</b> symptoms were discordant {{with the rest}} of the data, muscle biopsy was performed and disclosed rod-bearing non-atrophic fibers as the unique and predominant pathological feature. Their significance is examined in this paper...|$|R

60|$|Allie's joy was short-lived, and the {{reaction}} to disappointment was a violent, agonizing wrench. She lost all control of <b>her</b> <b>muscles</b> for a moment, and had to lean against the cabin to keep from falling.|$|E
6000|$|... "You have practiced so much, and so successfully, Major Dunwoodie, {{that it is}} {{no wonder}} you excel in deceiving the credulity of my sex," [...] {{returned}} Frances, attempting a smile, which the tremulousness of <b>her</b> <b>muscles</b> smothered at birth.|$|E
50|$|Caitlin was {{affected}} by her gen-factor causing her mass to increase and <b>her</b> <b>muscle</b> density to grow exponentially. (A letter column described her height as 6'5"). This gives her incredible strength and durability as well as increased stamina and agility. She has confronted and been able to hold her own {{against some of the}} strongest heroes and villains in the Wildstorm universe.|$|R
5000|$|Moon was {{diagnosed}} with compartment syndrome, and received emergency treatments to treat <b>her</b> arm <b>muscle</b> pain.|$|R
50|$|She can {{increase}} the density of <b>her</b> <b>muscle</b> tissue to boost her strength and/or speed to superhuman levels, shown capable of exceeding that of Captain Britain on two separate occasions. The use of this power {{is tied to the}} planet itself. During her confrontation with Galactus, she grew in stature to match the planet-eater's size, but the taller she grew, the more she was destabilizing the environment nearby.|$|R
60|$|The She-Ancient {{looks at}} the Newly Born critically; feels her bumps like a phrenologist; grips <b>her</b> <b>muscles</b> and shakes her limbs; {{examines}} her teeth; looks into {{her eyes for a}} moment; and finally relinquishes her with an air of having finished her job.|$|E
60|$|Kauffman {{was still}} {{suffering}} from his fall, {{and it became}} necessary for Helen to steady, him in his seat. <b>Her</b> <b>muscles</b> ached with the strain, but she made no complaint, for she feared the ranger might lessen the speed of their flight.|$|E
60|$|For an instant, {{the girl}} stood frozen with horror, {{unable to move}} a finger or to cry out; but only for an instant, and then, regaining control of <b>her</b> <b>muscles,</b> she stooped quickly and, {{grasping}} a heavy foot-stool, hurled it full at Peter of Colfax.|$|E

50|$|Watson gained notability {{when she}} was {{reportedly}} offered a $75,000 contract from Elite Model Management {{to serve as a}} fitness model, but declined because the agency would require her to take legal steroids to enhance <b>her</b> <b>muscle</b> size. She shared with Robin Roberts on Good Morning America and reporters from Inside Edition that taking steroids would go against her religious and personal beliefs, even though she was later accused by certain tabloids and talk show hosts of taking steroids to enhance her performance.|$|R
40|$|A 30 -year woman {{developed}} rhabdomyolysis {{and acute}} renal failure. She had history of amenor-rhea after her last delivery. On admission, she was pale, afebrile and ill, had slight tenderness of the <b>muscles.</b> <b>Her</b> <b>muscle</b> enzyme {{was high and}} her renal function decreased rapidly, suggesting rhabdomyolysis. Her laboratory investigation was compatible with panhypopituitarism. Treat-ment was started with levothyroxine and Hydrocortisone. Her renal function recovered com-pletely with conservative treatment without need of dialysis. The present case suggests that rhabdomyolysis could occur in patient with central hypothyroidism...|$|R

60|$|Tara of Helium {{fought to}} defend herself, but pitifully weak were <b>her</b> <b>muscles</b> against this brainless {{incarnation}} of brute power.

60|$|She felt {{a terrible}} hunger, {{a desire to}} take his head {{in her arms and}} kiss it. <b>Her</b> <b>muscles</b> ached and quivered with {{something}} she could not fathom. As she resisted she grew calm, but mysteriously sad, as if something were passing from her forever. The leaves whispered a message to her, and the stream repeated an occult note of joy, which was mixed with sorrow.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{report a}} girl with {{autosomal}} recessive congenital muscular dystrophy linked to chromosome 6 (MDC 1 A) who carries a homozygous out-of-frame deletion in exon 56 of the LAMA 2 gene but has a mild phenotype. She is still ambulant at age 13 years, shows white matter abnormalities on MRI, and traces of laminin alpha 2 in <b>her</b> <b>muscle</b> biopsy with one of three antibodies used.

60|$|As {{the horse}} started into a rapid walk Madeline {{gradually}} lost all pain and discomfort when she relaxed <b>her</b> <b>muscles.</b> Presently {{she let herself}} go and lay inert, greatly to her relief. For a little while {{she seemed to be}} half drunk with the gentle swaying of a hammock. Her mind became at once dreamy and active, as if it thoughtfully recorded the slow, soft impressions pouring in from all her senses.|$|E
60|$|It was too late, however, to turn back, for {{the current}} that carried her toward the ship was much too strong for <b>her</b> <b>muscles.</b> She could not have forced the heavy dugout up-stream against it, and {{all that was left}} her was to attempt either to make the shore without being seen by those upon the deck of the Kincaid, or to throw herself upon their mercy--otherwise she must be swept out to sea.|$|E
60|$|The rest of {{the episode}} passed off quietly. Sebastian, having {{delivered}} his bolt, began to think less of Hilda {{and more of the}} patient. He went on with his demonstration. As for Hilda, she gradually relaxed <b>her</b> <b>muscles,</b> and, with a deep-drawn breath, resumed her natural attitude. The tension was over. They had had their little skirmish, whatever it might mean, and had it out; now, they called a truce over the patient's body.|$|E
