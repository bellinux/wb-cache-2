50|$|The 1st Infantry Division of Army Group South and 32nd Infantry Division of Army Group North were {{selected}} to be issued the rifle, both being refitted from heavy losses on the Eastern Front; ammunition shortages meant the 1st ID was the only division fully equipped with it. The Kar 98k was retained as a specialist weapon for sniping and launching rifle grenades, while MP 40s were used by vehicle and artillery crews and officers. The StG 44 was issued to all infantry soldiers and employed for accurate short-range rapid-fire shooting (similar to how the MP 18 was used when it went into service). The assault rifles in a squad added firepower when the machine gun had to cease fire or move. When attacking a position, Kar 98k riflemen would use grenades against it at close-range, while StG 44 riflemen would fire in rapid semi-automatic or automatic bursts to keep the defenders suppressed. The magazine follower spring had a short service life, so soldiers were ordered to load no more than 25 rounds to reduce wear of the spring. In January 1945, a magazine was introduced fitted with a <b>fixed</b> <b>plug</b> to restrict its capacity to 25 rounds.

The second company, where I did some research, was a consultancy firm called Ementor. Here I both accomplished an interview and I worked there for nine weeks during the summer of 2000. The theoretical part is founded in my literature studies. The bibliography reflects what I have read during my work with the thesis. By reading a combination of articles, books and sites on the Internet I have established a foundation upon which I have based my discussions throughout the thesis.

The engine spins a magnet inside a coil, or, {{in the earlier}} designs, a coil inside a fixed magnet, and also operates a contact breaker, interrupting the current and causing the voltage to be increased sufficiently to jump a small gap.

In about 1902, Bosch introduced a double-coil magneto, with a <b>fixed</b> sparking <b>plug,</b> and the contact breaker outside the cylinder. Magnetos are not used in modern cars, but because they generate their own electricity they are often found on small engines such as those found in mopeds, lawnmowers, snowblowers, chainsaws, etc. where a battery-based electrical system is not present for any combination of necessity, weight, cost, and reliability reasons.

40|$|Nowadays suction {{caissons}} are extensively {{used for}} anchoring large offshore floating facilities. Installation of suction caissons in coarse grained soils {{is achieved by}} induced seepage flow in the soil. This reduces the soil resistance at the caisson tip, which contributes to the installation process. Installation in fine grained materials with a low permeability (silt or clay), is achieved by suction (relative to seabed pressure) within the caisson, which forces the caisson to embed. As a result the installation in layered soils, especially sand overlaid by clay, {{is expected to be}} more challenging since the reduction of tip resistance is restrained from flow restrictions in the clay layer. It is unclear to what extent the upper low permeable layer will impact the seepage flow and thus the desired tip reduction. During the installation in layered soils one of the main potential obstacles is excessive plug uplift, which could occur at certain applied suction pressures. The objective of the presented research is to assess the governing mechanisms of plug stability during installation of a suction caisson in layered soils where sand is overlaid by clay. It was found from case studies on installation in layered soils that water-injection-devices (WID) were used. Subsequently, two general types of failure mechanisms of plug stability for installation of suction caissons in sand overlying by clay were identified; plug uplift and plug cracking. Further analysis showed that the failure mechanism depends on the dimensions of both the caisson and the clay plug (thickness z). Furthermore, basic experiments executed as part of this research showed that plug cracking is an unlikely failure mechanism for standard aspect ratios (i. e. D/z < 6) Assessment of the plug stability was done by introducing two extreme cases; a <b>fixed</b> <b>plug</b> and a moving plug during installation. Stability of a <b>fixed</b> <b>plug</b> was assessed by introducing a fracture-ratio, which determines the crack-requirement for installation without uplift. When plug uplift can be accommodated to a certain extend (i. e. a moving plug), the relation between the plug uplift velocity and the installation-rate should be assessed. Based on analytical analyses, it is concluded that for low installation rates the total amount of uplift is higher compared to fast installation rates. Finally, the contribution of reverse end bearing (REB) as part of the plug stability was investigated for layered soils. The uplift mechanism at the interface of the plug (i. e. the clay-sand interface) consists of the process of suction mobilization and suction release within the sand. It was found that the magnitude and duration of the temporary resistance (i. e. the reverse end bearing) depends on the dissipation of negative excess pore pressures in time. This shows that for a typical installation period (1 - 6 hours) and hydraulic conductivities lower than 1 e- 5 m/s, temporary capacity due to delayed inflow of water can be considered. The analytical work was verified with the results of two analysed field cases and numerical analysis. In both field cases water injection devices were implemented as mitigating measure (i. e. to decrease tip resistance) to ensure penetration of the suction caisson in dense sands. However, this system is at present still not a proven technology and back-calculations did not clearly indicate the benefit of these devices. The contribution (or the absence) of REB was recognized for both practical and numerical back-calculations. This indicates that the magnitude of REB is highly dependent on time-effects (i. e. the permeability of the sand and installation rates).

The work is specifically related to a plant in which hollows are made from solid billets using a rotary piercing process and then reduced to required size and finished properties using the <b>fixed</b> <b>plug</b> cold drawing process. The thesis first discusses various methods of tube production {{in order to give}} a general background of tube manufacture. Then a review of the automation of the process planning function is presented in terms of its basic sub-tasks and the techniques and suitability of a knowledge-based system is established. In the light of such a review and a case study, the process planning problem is formulated in the domain of seamless tube manufacture, its basic sub-tasks are identified and capabilities and constraints of the available equipment in the specific plant are established. The task of collecting and collating the process planning knowledge in seamless tube manufacture is discussed and is mostly fulfilled from domain experts, analysing of existing manufacturing records specific to plant, textbooks and applicable Standards. For the cold drawing mill, tube-drawing schedules have been rationalised to correspond with practice. The validation of such schedules has been achieved by computing the process parameters and then comparing these with the drawbench capacity to avoid over-loading. The existing models cannot be simulated in the computer program as such, therefore a mathematical model has been proposed which estimates the process parameters which are in close agreement with experimental values established by other researchers. To implement the concepts, a Knowledge-Based System 'KBS- SETUPP' has been developed on Personal Computer using Turbo- Prolog. The system is capable of generating process plans, production schedules and some additional capabilities to supplement process planning.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{analysed}} {{the results}} {{and the status of}} China's building energy efficiency, explored the new areas of building energy in future: the industrialized composite wall on construction. As China is engaginga process of rapid urbanization,it is believed thatlarge amount of construction will continue for 25 - 30 years, and all of new buildings must be strictly in accordance with the standards of energy-saving by 50 % or 65 % in the processes of design and construction. Chinese construction industry is currently implementing the “Four Savings and Environment Protection” policy, which requires energy, land, water and materials saving and environmental protection in every building project. In Heilongjiang Province, as other areas in China, the requirements of energy-efficient design have been comprehensively and strictly implementedon the new buildingssince 2000. By 2010, energy-efficient design has been completely popularized in all kinds of new buildings by 50 % energy saving compared with the same type of buildings built in 1980 s. According to the requirements of the Ministry of Construction, in the future the further energy efficiency targets should be increased from 50 % to 65 %, meanwhile the main field of building energyefficiencywill been changed from the initial entry points such as the thermal insulation of externalwall, roof, doors and windows to further wide areas, such as the Optimization of building material, component manufacturing, construction quality and method, all of which could be realized by the industrialized composite panels and walls completely. Industrialized composite panels and wallsbring thoroughgoing innovationson wall materials and construction, the improvementof the construction accuracy, so that the wall thermal insulation performance is much higher than traditional buildings. Due to the productionconcentrated in the factory and the batch processing, the energy consumption ofbuilding industrialization is much lower than the traditional human construction at the construction site. The industrialized composite panel and wall of buildings can reduce the loss of the main materials of construction,the assembling construction reduce the loss of Secondary buildingmaterials. Compared with traditional construction methods, building industrialization of the composite panelrealizesthe field fabricated construction, which greatly minimizes the generation of construction waste, building waste water emissions, construction noise interference, harmful gases and dust emissions, and so on. The Building industrialization could maximize the improvement of the quality of components and assembly precision, and effectively reduce the roof leaks, wall cracks, quality defects of wall and window such as cold air infiltration, so the architectural quality and accuracy can be improved significantly. Factory production and on-site assembling of prefabricated components can reduce the workers of construction site and management, saving a lot of labor costs. Building industrialization transfer most of the operation to production line, saving construction cost and schedule greatly. It is particularly important to the construction in cold areas. Moreover, three types of building composite walls and panel are introduced. In this paper, composite walls and panel include composite material, composite structure or both of them applied in the wall and panel. The first kind of composite wall is the straw board. The straw board is clean, which is made of natural straw or wheat straw as the main raw material. This kind of straw board is mainly used for internal and external walls of the building and roof of the building, etc. Straw board whichis regarded as wall materials generally does not work as load-bearing walls. When it comes to application, the surface should be decorated to ensure that its fire, moisture, fire-retardant abilities. Straw board is not only suitable for load-bearing frame structure buildings, including civil construction, light industrial plants, but also for the old buildings which need to be rebuild, storage buildings and temporary buildings, etc. It is a lightweight, high strength, thermal insulation board which is new and environmentally friendly, particularly suitable to use in cold regions construction. The second example is the HS-EPS core column structure system, whichis invented by Harbin Hong Sheng housing energy system research and development centre with the whole intellectual property patents. This system consists of base beam, EPS moulded wall composed with core column of reinforced concrete, eaves ring beam and roof trusses and other components, is suitable for various types of single storeybuildings. EPS module consists of polystyrene beads by heating and foaming, through a dedicated heat moulding equipment and moulds in the system with closed-cell structure of different types, different specifications and different shape. The modules are rectangular, which internal and external surfaces distribute the uniform dovetails. There are two bridges connecting the <b>fixed</b> <b>plug</b> door in the middle of three 200 mm × 240 mm rectangular hole, both inside and outside of the hole wall thickness is 50 mm. In 2010, itwas applied in Piaohe town as a pilot project and in Antu County as 800 post-disaster housing, where thissystem has been widely recognized. The third sample is Gao Ge Composite Panel of Husk Mortar, with the both advantages of composite material and composite structure. This panelis precast, made from light husk mortar, welded wire mesh and steel as the skeleton, and thermal, noise insulation layers. The husk mortar is made of cement, sand, husks and water by mixing. This panel can be used to the wall-bearing housing, and multi-storied and high-rise reinforced concrete frame construction as the envelope, its overall size is the same with the external wall of a room, as in Four sides of the panel are joined with the beams and columns of the buildings. The wall panel consists of two surface layer of husk mortar, and two insulation layer (benzene or rock cotton) and a air layer inside.

Concretely, the Slab Method (SM), with and without friction effects, and the Upper Bound Method (UBM) have been appliced. In this last case, the plastic deformation zone has been modelled by Triangular Rigid Zones (TRZ). The friction between the out surface of the tube and the die, and between the inner surface of the tube and the plug has been modelled by Coulomb friction. Besides, {{the change in the}} diameter of the tube has been considered negligible during the process, then, the forming process can be assumend that it is made under a state of plane strain. Findings: The results obtained by each method have been compared between them and, besides, with the obtained ones by the Finite Element Method (FEM) and the experimental ones extract from the literature about the theme. It has been able to be proven that all of them are reasonably close to a value for a certain set of parameters values.

The work is part of Volvo Aero's focus on proprietary (self-developed) technologies. Inspection plugs can be found on virtually all aircraft engines and gas turbines. They are used during inspections with fiber optics done at regular intervals during engine operation. Since the inspection plugs are screwed in and out many times during the life of an engine, {{it is important that the}} handling (the assembly and disassembly) is simple. It is also very important that the <b>plugs</b> are properly <b>fixed</b> in position to prevent them from coming off during operation. The focus of the work was to develop proposals on how the assembly and <b>fixing</b> of <b>plugs</b> could be designed to simplify the handling and have adequate and simple function. The procedure during the work was to first study relevant theory and methods that could be used. Then development was carried out according to the first steps of the systematic design methods. These steps include product specifications, concept generation, evaluation and selection of concepts, and development of selected concept. During the implementation, a number of tools and methods, including QFD, FMEA and decision matrices were used. Out of 14 developed concepts, two were chosen for comparison with a leading rival. Both developed concepts turned out to outscore the competitor and the main difference was the cost of production. One of the concepts was considered to have advantages over the other and was consequently chosen for further development. Geometry, manufacturing, materials, sealing and misalignment were the focus areas of the development.

The analysis is realized {{by means of the}} upper bound method (UBM), modelling the plastic deformation zone by triangular rigid zones (TRZ), under the validated assumption that the process occurs under plane strain conditions. The obtained results allow establishing, for each material, a group of geometrical parameters, friction conditions, a set of plugs that make possible to carry out the process under good conditions, and the optimum plug to carry out the process using the minimum amount of energy. The proposed model is validated by means of an own finite element analysis (FEA) carried out under different conditions and, in addition, by other finite element method (FEM) simulations and real experiments taken from other researchers found in the literature (called literature simulations and literature experimental results, respectively). As a main conclusion, it is possible to affirm that the plug that allows carrying out the process with minimum quantity of energy is cylindrical in most cases...|$|R
