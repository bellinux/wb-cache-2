Turn to, to ‘shoot away’, pick up and store the catch and clean up. We worked bloody long hours. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> six deckies, four firemen, one engineer, one wireless operator and the master and mate. The galley was right aft with the mess room beneath. You would get your feed, climb down the hatchway to the mess room below. We would get {{a bucket of water}} from the galley to take to the forecastle where we bunked. By the time we got forward we would have only half a bucket of hot water to wash in but after a couple of days you didn’t worry about washing. You were wet through most of the time so it didn’t matter.|$|E
500|$|Only {{entering}} two European charts, [...] "Flatline" [...] reached number 14 on the Irish Singles Chart, {{however it}} peaked at number 50 on the UK Singles Chart. The group denied allegations {{of it being}} a [...] "flop": [...] "I don't think our song got lost on the radio. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> certain things that happened behind the scenes that couldn't be helped. Our goal was to put a song out that people liked and we think we've done that". They also expressed preference in going on tour and releasing an album than having a [...] "throw-away hit" [...] on the charts." [...] To NME, Buchanan reiterated those sentiments and denied rumours floating {{at the time that}} speculated that the group had been dropped by Polydor.|$|E
500|$|On 1August 1986, U2 regrouped in Dublin {{to resume}} {{work on the}} album and begin the {{recording}} stage proper. During this more intense phase of the sessions, the group began {{to work at the}} Edge's newly purchased house, Melbeach, in seaside Monkstown. Lanois said of Melbeach, [...] "That was less of a rock 'n' roll room but we made it work. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> a lot of headaches, isolating people and having to build baffles around the place." [...] The Edge called the house [...] "more sombre" [...] but said it had a [...] "solid unpretentious quality that seemed to hold the energy in". [...] "Mothers of the Disappeared" [...] and [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky" [...] were among the songs that evolved at Melbeach. Lanois said that most of the record was done there, and that it was the preferred location for mixing. Writing and recording alternated between the two houses and Windmill Lane Studios. In late August during Hurricane Charley, U2 were visited at Danesmoate by Robbie Robertson, the former guitarist of the Band. Robertson was in Ireland to complete his self-titled debut solo album that he had begun with Lanois. Together, U2 and Robertson recorded the tracks [...] "Sweet Fire of Love" [...] and [...] "Testimony", both of which appear on Robertson's album.|$|E

2500|$|Tim Burke, {{the visual}} effects {{supervisor}} of the series, said of the production on Harry Potter, [...] "It was this huge family; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> over 700 people working at Leavesden, an industry in itself." [...] David Heyman said, [...] "When the first film opened, no way did I think we'd make eight films. That didn't seem feasible until after we'd done the fourth." [...] Nisha Parti, the production consultant on the first film, said that Heyman [...] "made the first film very much the way he felt the studio Warner Bros. wanted to make it." [...] After the film's success, Heyman was given [...] "more freedom".|$|E
2500|$|On March 7, however, Gingrich {{stated that}} President Obama should [...] "exercise {{a no-fly zone}} this evening." [...] On March 23, Gingrich said: [...] "I would not have intervened. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> {{a lot of other}} ways to affect Gaddafi." [...] In a {{subsequent}} statement on Facebook the same day, Gingrich attempted to clarify his remarks, stating that when President Obama publicly declared [...] "it's time for Gaddafi to go" [...] on March 3, he [...] "put the prestige and authority of the United States" [...] on the line and anything short of regime change would have been seen as a defeat for the United States. According to Gingrich, [...] "the President should have moved immediately to consult with Congress to implement a no-fly zone" [...] but instead [...] "wasted weeks trying to get approval from the United Nations instead of Congress" [...] resulting in a change of mission from ousting Gaddafi to one of humanitarian intervention.|$|E

2500|$|This {{game was}} Michigan's worst defeat since 1968 when they lost 50 to 14 at Ohio State. Dennis Dixon {{accounted}} for 368 {{yards and a}} career-high 4 touchdowns. Three touchdowns were thrown to three different receivers for 85, 61, and 45-yard scoring passes on Dixon's way to 292 throwing yards. [...] Dixon also rushed for 76 yards and one touchdown. [...] The Ducks led by 25 at halftime, and faced little opposition in the second half. [...] According to Oregon coach Mike Bellotti the game was a [...] "good win because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> some questions about how Michigan was going to bounce back, and whether we would be competitive. [...] I think our players took that to heart." [...] With this game Michigan opened the season with two home losses, {{the first time that}} had happened since 1959. [...] It also gave them a losing streak of four games, the most in four decades. [...] Wolverines coach Lloyd Carr said [...] "We have good kids and they're hurting. [...] If losing doesn't make you hurt, you shouldn't be at Michigan." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to David A. Morse (1907–199) {{during an}} 1977 interview, in 1949, who had lately been {{general counsel of}} the NLRB and was then U.S. {{delegate}} to the International Labor Conference of the [...] International Labour Organization (ILO), said: [...] At about that time, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> all these questions being raised about certain people in the Labor Board; not so much about their qualifications as their political orientation and what Paul Herzog wrote there may have been as a result of that. I remember there was this chap, Nat Witt, who had been head of the unit at the NLRB, that was responsible for the examiners. I recall that he had been accused from time to time by outside groups for being much tied in with Lee Pressman {{and the two of them}} were very much tied in with the Communist Party. [...] In 1950, the U.S. State Department revoked singer and civil rights activist Paul Robeson's passport as a means of preventing him from traveling overseas and continuing his left-wing political work. Witt was Robeson's first attorney and initiated Robeson's eight-year battle to regain his passport.|$|E
2500|$|The {{newspaper}} highlighted {{four factors}} driving {{the opposition to}} the mosque: a dislike of immigrants, a fear that Christianity was losing its grip on a Bible Belt heartland, a [...] "swell of fear and hatred" [...] prompted by terrorist attacks, and the insecurity of the worst economic climate since the Great Depression. In past slumps, Chinese immigrants had been ostracized for being non-Christians, Catholics had been ostracized for being [...] "the wrong kind of Christians", and this time Muslims were suffering the brunt of prejudice. Rabbi Rami Shapiro noted that [...] "Muslims are in the way of God's plan" [...] for some anti-Muslim Christian Zionists, who believe that Muslims in Iran and Iraq will be forced out of their homes by Israeli expansion that will pave the way for the Second Coming of Jesus. Professor Ron Messier, who teaches Islamic studies and lives in Murfreesboro, commented: [...] "It's happened because this is an election year and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> some political candidates who thought that, here in Middle Tennessee, {{a lot of people have}} very right leanings and they could gain some political leverage by promoting fear about people who have been here for 20 years or more without ever being an issue." ...|$|E

2500|$|In several {{interviews}} that Carter gave {{around the time}} the film came out, {{he said that if}} I Want to Believe proved financially successful, a third installment would be made going back to the TV series' mythology, focusing specifically on the alien invasion and colonization of Earth foretold in the series finale, due to occur on December 22, 2012. Fox Chairman Tom Rothman, responding to an interview question regarding the possibility of a third X-Files movie, said in October 2008, [...] "It's really up to Chris , David [...] and Gillian [...] ". During an interview at the Sarajevo Film Festival in August 2009, Anderson was asked about a third film and responded, [...] "They talked about maybe doing it in 2012. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> discussions about that. I don't know whether that's going to happen or not, but there isn't any reason not to do it." [...] Frank Spotnitz responded to his blog readers' requests for clarification regarding Anderson's comments by denying that any deal was in place, saying, [...] "I'm afraid I have no news to report other than our continuing desire to make a third film if there's an audience for it." [...] In an October 2009 interview, David Duchovny likewise said that he wanted to do a 2012 X-Files movie, but still did not know if he would get the chance.|$|E
