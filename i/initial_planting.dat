40|$|Farmers {{experience}} delayed crop emergence {{and question}} if it decreases plant growth or yield. The effects of delayed emergence within soybean populations {{have not been}} well studied. Studies of delayed emergence have addressed only populations and situations in which vegetative growth and reproductive plasticity is not limited. No studies have attempted to quantify sources of compensation beyond seeds per plant, seed size and crop growth rate. Our objectives were to determine if delayed emergence of soybean grown in 19 -cm rows 1) alters the growth {{and the development of}} individual plants and the stand of plants and 2) causes competition or contribution to overall yield and individual yield forming factors. The delays were created by planting 38 -cm rows and interplanting between rows at succeeding growth stages of the initial stand of soybean. Row-to-row delay was studied across three factors: 2 <b>initial</b> <b>plant</b> populations (247, 000 and 123, 500 plants ha- 1), 3 interplanted percent delay (33, 67, and 100 % of both initial populations), and 4 interplanted timings of delay (when <b>initial</b> rows were: <b>Planted</b> (None), VC, V 2, and V 4). Treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications near West Lafayette, Indiana. Five flagged plants per row in initial and interplanted rows were measured for plant height, nodes per plant, and growth stage. Post-harvest measurements were taken on 2 m of harvested row and included branches per plant, biomass, pods and seeds per main stem, pods and seeds per branch, total seed weight per main stem, and total seed weight per branch. Delayed plants generally produced fewer nodes and less biomass per plant and per m 2 due to constrained vegetative growth and high competition from established neighbor <b>plants.</b> <b>Initial</b> <b>plants</b> decreased height to node ratio, increased mainstem nodes per plant, increased overall area nodes, increased biomass per branch, and generally increased area biomass (within a percent delay by timing of delay interaction) in response to prolonged timing of delay in 2010. High population or low percent delay increased <b>initial</b> <b>plant</b> competitiveness and contribution and decreased that of delayed plants. Overall yield was not affected by any treatment combination except in 2011 due to late season hail damage effects upon soybean compensatory ability. In general, harvest index, seeds per pod, seed size, pods, seeds, and yield of delayed plants decreased as timing of delay was prolonged. Harvest index, pods, seeds, and yield of <b>initial</b> <b>plants</b> generally increased to compensate proportionally. <b>Initial</b> <b>plant</b> branch and mainstem seed yield both increased drastically (when measured in 2010) as delay lengthened which increased area yield of <b>initial</b> <b>plants.</b> In 2010, <b>initial</b> <b>plant</b> area yield increased 230 and 434 g m- 2 for VC and V 2 timing of delay compared to no delay control. Total area mainstem yield decreased in importance (though still contributing a majority of yield) and total area branch yield increased in importance with prolonged timing of delay. Initial population and percent delay interacted with timing of delay to affect the magnitude of many of these changes. Though delayed emergence caused shifts in source of yield, soybean with uninterrupted growth compensated fully. ...|$|R

40|$|Plants {{and their}} ramets often occur through space in non-random arrangements, {{potentially}} due to effects of local dispersal, competition with neighbors, and heterogeneity in the environment. Given that a plant 2 ̆ 7 s potential influence on others {{is limited in}} space, such plant pattern likely affects community dynamics. The studies presented further our understanding of effects of plant pattern by addressing if, and in what ways, fine-scale plant arrangement affects perennial grassland communities. In restored grasslands, I found that seeding method affected pattern formation, likely due to effects of altering local seed density and the depth at which seeds were sown. In these grasslands, fine-scale plant arrangement explained aspects of invader abundance that were not accounted for by plot-scale richness and evenness measures. In an experimental system, <b>initial</b> <b>plant</b> arrangement was related to subsequent invasion, but hypotheses concerning effects of arrangement on species coexistence were not supported. In total, {{these findings suggest that}} plant pattern may affect communities independently of the number and abundances of the species present and have implications for how practitioners might use knowledge of effects of <b>initial</b> <b>plant</b> arrangement to improve restoration success.

Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.)

The end-use quality of about 2, 000 side and center boards was analyzed {{as a function of}} <b>initial</b> <b>plant</b> density (1, 000, 2, 000, and 4, 000 trees per hectare) and log position within the stem. & Methods Sawn timber quality was described by knottiness, density, modulus of elasticity, and strength. Explanatory pa-rameters were radial position, longitudinal position, and <b>initial</b> <b>plant</b> density. All boards were strength graded visually and by the grading machine GoldenEye- 706 using both X-rays for detecting densities and size as well as position of knots and laser interferometry for detecting eigenfrequency (DIN 4074, DIN 2012; EN 14081 - 2, CEN 2010). & Results High plant density led to better mechanical sawn timber quality. Significant differences were especially ob-served between 1, 000 and 2, 000 trees per hectare. The yield of machine strength-graded center boards of strength class C 24 increased from 50 to 89 % at low and high <b>initial</b> <b>plant</b> density, respectively. & Conclusion Foresters are able to improve end-product qual-ity by controlling planting density in particular. The round-wood price that foresters get should be based on the propor-tion of higher strength classes within logs to give incentives for a more quality-oriented forest management...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{field and}} {{experimental}} {{studies show that}} the wakes behind individual patches of aquatic vegetation, as well as the interaction and merger of neighboring wakes, produce zones of diminished velocity that may enhance deposition and encourage patch growth and patch merger. In the present study, these patch-scale biogeomorphic interactions are incorporated into a simple model for vegetated landscape evolution. The initial flow field is solved by using a porous media formulation for hydraulic resistance. The velocity in wake regions is then adjusted to match the wake structure measured in laboratory studies with individual and pairs of vegetation patches. Vegetation is added based on a probabilistic function linked to the velocity field. The simulations explore the influence of <b>initial</b> <b>plant</b> density (ID) and limiting velocity (LV, the velocity above which no plants can grow) on landscape evolution. Three types of stable landforms can occur: full vegetation coverage, channeled, and sparse. By including the influence of wakes, full vegetation coverage can be achieved from <b>initial</b> <b>plant</b> densities as low as 5 %. In contrast, simulations that exclude the influence of wakes rarely reach full vegetation coverage, reinforcing the idea that growth within wakes is an important component in vegetated landscape evolution. The model also highlights the role of flow diversion into bare regions (channels) in the promotion of growth within vegetated regions. Finally, sparse landscapes result when the <b>initial</b> <b>plant</b> density is sufficiently low that no wake interactions can occur, so that patch merger cannot occur, emphasizing the importance of the patch interaction length scale.

40|$|During {{the last}} few decades, the Arctic has {{experienced}} large-scale vegetation changes. Understanding the mechanisms behind this vegetation change is crucial for our ability to predict future changes. This study tested the hypothesis that decreased cryogenic disturbances cause vegetation change in patterned ground study fields (non-sorted circles) in Abisko, Sweden during {{the last few}} decades. The hypothesis was tested by surveying the composition of plant communities across a gradient in cryogenic disturbance and by reinvestigating plant communities previously surveyed in the 1980 s to scrutinise how these communities changed in response to reduced cryogenic disturbance. Whereas the historical changes in species occurrence associated with decreased cryogenic disturbances were relatively consistent with the changes along the contemporary gradient of cryogenic disturbances, the species abundance revealed important transient changes highly dependent on the <b>initial</b> <b>plant</b> community composition.
