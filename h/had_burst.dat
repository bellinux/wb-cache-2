5|$|The {{damage done}} to Ford was great. The local fire brigades helped put out the {{numerous}} fires and clear up the dead {{in and around the}} station. Mostly foam was used as the main water pipe <b>had</b> <b>burst.</b> Other fire units used water from static water tanks and a ditch which had filled from the fractured pipe. Ford had received less warning than the other targets and suffered heavier casualties: 28 killed and 75 wounded. Some 14 aircraft were destroyed: five Blackburn Sharks, five Fairey Swordfish, and two Fairey Albacore. A further 26 aircraft were damaged but repairable. As well as petrol and oil installations, two hangars, the motor transport hangar, two stores buildings, the ratings' and petty officers' canteens and numerous accommodation buildings were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The root of {{the trouble}} was an {{economic}} crisis—initiated by the Panic of 1837—which was entering its sixth year in 1842. A speculative bubble <b>had</b> <b>burst</b> in 1836–39, causing a collapse of the financial sector and a subsequent depression. The country became deeply divided over the best response to the crisis. Conditions got even worse in early 1842 because a deadline was looming. A decade earlier, when the economy was strong, Congress had promised Southern states {{that there would be}} a reduction in hated federal tariffs. Northern states welcomed tariffs, which protected their infant industries. But the South had no industrial base and depended on open access to British markets for their cotton. In a recommendation to Congress, Tyler lamented that it would be necessary to override the Compromise Tariff of 1833 and raise rates beyond the 20 percent limit. Under the previous deal, this would suspend the distribution program, with all revenues going to the federal government.|$|E

25|$|However, by 1979-80, {{the bubble}} <b>had</b> <b>burst</b> {{due to the}} global {{economic}} crisis {{set in motion by}} the Yom Kippur War between Israel and the Arabs in 1973. Rising oil prices and falling global commodity prices combined to wreak havoc on a fragile and landlocked Malawian economy based on an insular and indefensible ISI macroeconomic strategy. Increasingly, the economy was rearranged into a political tool to serve the consumption needs of the emerging Malawian middle-class and thus render it less prone to revolution.|$|E

That was his eighth 2015-16 UEFA Europa League goal. Sevilla won the match 3–1 to become the first team to win the UEFA Cup/Europa League three times in a row.

The 1st Battalion of the 23rd Regiment, having formed two columns, rushed into the village, and, after crossing the stream, received a sharp fire from the windows of the houses on the opposite side. The left column of the battalion stormed a farm house, of which, after it <b>had</b> <b>burst</b> in the gates with hatchets, it gained possession, and thus protected the advance of the right column.|$|E

The dam, owned by West Penn Power, reached the highest levels in its 60-year history, prompting the company to open flood gates, which flooded Point Marion with [...] of water.

2500|$|The {{boundaries}} of the early lands settled by Chaldeans in the early 800s BC have not been identified with precision by historians. Chaldea generally referred to the low, marshy, alluvial land around the estuaries of the Tigris and Euphrates, which in ancient times discharged their waters through separate mouths into the sea. From the tenth to late seventh centuries BC, Chaldea, {{like the rest of}} Mesopotamia and much of the ancient Near East, Anatolia, Caucasus and North Africa came to be dominated by the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911–608 BC), which was based in northern Mesopotamia. Between 608 BC and 557 BC, when the Chaldean tribe <b>had</b> <b>burst</b> their narrow bonds and obtained their short lived period of ascendency over all of Babylonia, they briefly gave their name to the whole land, which was then called Chaldea by some peoples, particularly the Jews, although this term eventually fell out of use. The Old Testament book of the prophet Habakkuk describes the Chaldeans as [...] "a bitter and swift nation".|$|E

[...] REZ {{was no longer the}} dominant force in Christian rock; instead, Stryper <b>had</b> <b>burst</b> onto the scene in all their yellow-and-black glory, bringing Christian metal to the mainstream with To Hell with the Devil in 1986, which sold millions of albums and made the band a mainstay on MTV. [...] Amy Grant had scored her first No.1 US pop hit the same year with [...] "The Next Time I Fall," [...] a duet with former Chicago lead singer Peter Cetera. [...] Even Christian alternative music had made inroads into the mainstream when The 77s signed with Island Records and their self-titled album received a favorable review in Rolling Stone. [...] In addition, the Jesus People USA community established the annual Cornerstone Festival during this period, which would serve as a springboard to mainstream success for future Christian artists like Sixpence None the Richer and P.O.D.|$|E
2500|$|The Great North of Scotland Railway (GNoSR) {{was formed}} in 1845 to build a railway between Inverness and Aberdeen and so link up with the {{railways}} to the south. The proposed [...] route needed few major engineering works. At the same time, the Perth & Inverness Railway proposed a direct route over the Grampian Mountains to Perth, and the Aberdeen, Banff & Elgin Railway suggested a route that followed the coast to better serve the Banffshire and Morayshire fishing ports. The Aberdeen, Banff & Elgin failed to raise funds and the Perth & Inverness Railway was rejected by Parliament because the railway would be at altitudes that approached [...] and needed steep gradients. The Great North of Scotland Railway Act received Royal Assent on 26 June 1846. Two years later the railway mania bubble <b>had</b> <b>burst</b> and the necessary finances could not be raised. Construction eventually began in November 1852, albeit only [...] to Huntly, and this line was officially opened on 19 September 1854.

2500|$|The newly {{purchased}} {{vessel was}} immediately commissioned for Royal Navy {{service as a}} sixth-rate under the name Tartar's Prize. Commander Thomas Baillie of Tartar was promoted to post-captain and transferred to take command. A survey of the vessel quickly revealed difficulties with her armament. One of the six-pounder cannons <b>had</b> <b>burst</b> during the March engagement with Tartar, and {{an examination of the}} others revealed that most were very poorly made. They were also too large; the gun barrels were [...] long in a gundeck measuring only [...] on each side, leaving insufficient room for the crew to reload when the guns had recoiled after firing. Baillie wrote to the Board of Ordnance protesting the uselessness of these oversized cannon, and was eventually rewarded with replacement six-pounders of a more standard length. He was less successful with a further problem aboard the vessel; the gun ports had no lids, leaving the gundeck constantly awash in heavy swell. Despite requests these were not installed, leaving the crew to rig canvas awnings over the open ports {{in order to reduce the}} flow of seawater into the hull.|$|E
