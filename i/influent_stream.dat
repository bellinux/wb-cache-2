40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{dissolved}} hydrogen causes rapid dehalogenation of chlorinated hydrocarbons {{in the presence of a}} palladium catalyst. The speed and completeness of these reactions offer advantages in designing remediation technologies for certain ground water contamination problems. However, a practical design challenge arises in the need to saturate the aqueous phase with hydrogen in an expeditious manner. To address this issue, a two-stage treatment reactor has been developed. The first stage consists of an electrolytic cell that generates hydrogen by applying a voltage potential across the <b>influent</b> water <b>stream.</b> The second stage consists of a catalyst column of palladium metal supported on alumina beads. A bench-scale reactor has been used to test this design for treating ground water contaminated with trichloroethene and other chlorinated hydrocarbons. In <b>influent</b> <b>streams</b> containing contaminant concentrations up to 4 ppm, initial results confirm that destruction efficiencies greater than 95 % may be achieved with residence times short enough to allow practical implementation in specially designed flow-through treatment wells.

40|$|Capacitive Deionization (CDI) is a {{relatively}} new deionization technology based on the temporary storage of ions on an electrically charged surface. By directing a flow between two oppositely charged surfaces, negatively charged ions will adsorb onto the positively charged surface, and positively charged ions will adsorb onto the negatively charged surface. To optimize CDI design for various applications, performance relations in CDI systems have to be understood. CDI performance is determined by two factors, adsorption capacity and adsorption rate. The adsorption capacity is important for performance because only a limited amount of ions can be adsorbed onto an electrically charged surface; after the total adsorption capacity is reached the surface has to be discharged. The adsorption rate is important for performance because a higher adsorption rate results in faster removal of ions from a certain stream. The objective of this thesis is to relate the performance of a CDI unit to the specifications of the <b>influent</b> <b>stream</b> and the design aspects of the unit, such as the used electrode materials in the CDI unit. To obtain these relations, the focus in this thesis is on using electrochemical characterization techniques to obtain CDI performance in terms of charge transport, and furthermore linking this charge performance to desalination performance. By using this approach, we found that the total adsorption capacity of a CDI unit is determined by the double-layer area present in the used electrodes, where a higher double-layer area gives a higher adsorption capacity. The adsorption capacity of the double-layer area is in turn dependent on the applied potential and the chemical and physical properties of the treated water. This analysis can be used to screen for activated carbons with a high amount of double-layer area. We found that materials with a high amount of pores with a size around 1. 6 nm have a high double-layer area. The adsorption rate of a CDI unit is mainly determined by the absolute conductivity of the <b>influent</b> <b>stream.</b> This relation can be used to optimize spacer and electrode thickness for various influent streams. The charge efficiency, i. e. the amount of ions adsorbed per amount of charge adsorbed, is limited by counter ion expulsion. It could be improved by placing ion-exchange membranes in front of the electrodes. By integrating all obtained relations in a mathematical model, deionization performance could be predicted for CDI systems with and without ion-exchange membranes. This model can be used to predict deionization performance for any operational condition, as well as to identify and resolve bottlenecks in the operation of the CDI system...|$|E

A bioreactor consist of microfiltration membrane (MF) and actual municipal wastewater as <b>influent</b> <b>stream.</b> The FS-MBR was operated during 161 days. Results: The result showed that average removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD 5), total suspended solids (TSS) and volatile suspended solids (VSS) were obtained > 90 % and with variation of influent COD, BOD 5, TSS and VSS, the removal efficiency no significantly change.

40|$|Removal of {{phosphorus}} (P) {{and nitrogen}} (N) from municipal wastewaters {{is required to}} mitigate eutrophication of receiving water bodies. While most treatment plants achieve good N removal using influent carbon (C), the use of influent C to facilitate {{enhanced biological phosphorus removal}} (EBPR) is poorly explored. A number of operational parameters can facilitate optimum use of influent C and this study investigated the effects of cycle length, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration during aerobic period and influent solids on biological P and N removal in sequencing batch reactors (SRBs) using municipal wastewaters. Increasing cycle length from 3 to 6 h increased P removal efficiency, which was attributed to larger portion of N being removed via nitrite pathway and more biodegradable organic C becoming available for EBPR. Further increasing cycle length from 6 to 8 h decreased P removal efficiencies as the demand for biodegradable organic C for denitrification increased as a result of complete nitrification. Decreasing DO concentration in the aerobic period from 2 to 0. 8 mg L(- 1) increased P removal efficiency but decreased nitrification rates possibly due to oxygen limitation. Further, sedimented wastewater was proved to be a better <b>influent</b> <b>stream</b> than non-sedimented wastewater possibility due to the detrimental effect of particulate matter on biological nutrient removal...|$|E

Many samples were taken from five streams during the spring and autumn seasons at the same area called the Šumava Mountains according to PERLA method.

Despite of the fact that these streams are situated at the same area and have very similar flows, fish abundancy and the way of farming in their basins differ. These aspects influenced the benthos composition in every single stream and that is why this work should provide survey about the composition and biomass of benthos in particular watercourse.
