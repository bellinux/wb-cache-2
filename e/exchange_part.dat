All citizens of Israel would be required to swear a loyalty oath to retain citizenship. Those who refuse could remain in Israel as permanent residents. The loyalty oath would apply to all citizens regardless of ethnicity. According to Timothy Waters [...] "the loyalty oath almost certainly violates international law."

Further adding to its depth, golfers play in pairs and usually talk about their own interests. If players put the proper landmarks in the proper places, these stories may progress and have a happy ending, which also adds to players' course. There is also a 'sandbox' mode, which allows players {{to play the game}} with an infinite amount of money, so they can hone their designing skills.|$|E

5000|$|If the two {{countries}} specialize in producing the good for which they have the absolute advantage, and if they <b>exchange</b> <b>part</b> of the good with each other, both of the {{two countries}} can end up with more of each good than they would have in the absence of trade. In the absence of trade, each country produces one unit of cloth and one unit of wine, i.e. a combined total production of 2 units of cloth and 2 units of wine. Here, if England commits all of its labor (80+100) for the production of cloth for which England has the absolute advantage, England produces (80+100)÷80=2.25 units of cloth. On the other hand, if Portugal commits all of its labor (90+120) for the production of wine, Portugal produces (90+120)÷90=2.33... units of wine. The combined total production in this case is 2.25 units of cloth and 2.33 units of wine which is greater than the total production of each good had there been no specialization. Assuming free trade this will lead to cheaper prices for both goods for both countries.|$|E
50|$|In practice, Kohn-Sham {{theory can}} be applied in several {{distinct}} ways depending on what is being investigated. In solid state calculations, the local density approximations are still commonly used along with plane wave basis sets, as an electron gas approach is more appropriate for electrons delocalised through an infinite solid. In molecular calculations, however, more sophisticated functionals are needed, and a huge variety of exchange-correlation functionals {{have been developed for}} chemical applications. Some of these are inconsistent with the uniform electron gas approximation, however, they must reduce to LDA in the electron gas limit. Among physicists, probably the most widely used functional is the revised Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange model (a direct generalized-gradient parametrization of the free electron gas with no free parameters); however, this is not sufficiently calorimetrically accurate for gas-phase molecular calculations. In the chemistry community, one popular functional is known as BLYP (from the name Becke for the <b>exchange</b> <b>part</b> and Lee, Yang and Parr for the correlation part). Even more widely used is B3LYP which is a hybrid functional in which the exchange energy, in this case from Becke's exchange functional, is combined with the exact energy from Hartree-Fock theory. Along with the component exchange and correlation funсtionals, three parameters define the hybrid functional, specifying how much of the exact exchange is mixed in. The adjustable parameters in hybrid functionals are generally fitted to a 'training set' of molecules. Unfortunately, although the results obtained with these functionals are usually sufficiently accurate for most applications, there is no systematic way of improving them (in contrast to some of the traditional wavefunction-based methods like configuration interaction or coupled cluster theory). Hence in the current DFT approach {{it is not possible to}} estimate the error of the calculations without comparing them to other methods or experiments.|$|E
40|$|The spin {{splitting}} {{observed in}} two- dimensional electron systems at high magnetic fields {{is not only}} determined by the single-electron Zeeman energy but also by many-particle effects. Electron-electron interaction results in an enhanced g-factor which can be described by the <b>exchange</b> <b>part</b> of the Coulomb interaction. Nuclear spin lattice relaxation experiments analysing the Overhauser Shift in Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) measurements reveal that the exchange term is dominant. The spin splitting {{is strongly dependent on}} magnetic field and temperature. Numerical simulations enable the quantitative determination of the <b>exchange</b> <b>part</b> of the spin split energy. Transport activation measurements verify that the <b>exchange</b> <b>part</b> is proportional to the spin polarization of the electrons...|$|E
