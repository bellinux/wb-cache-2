40|$|Abstract—A clock {{generation}} circuit having {{the function of}} multiphase locking was designed using the synchronous mirror delay (SMD) scheme. The internal clock can be synchronized to the external clock with intended phase difference. The synchro-nizing error of the clock {{generation circuit}} is reduced below the <b>delay</b> time of <b>unit</b> <b>delay</b> stage by compensation characteristics of detecting circuit in SMD. A 32 -M double data rate (DDR) SRAM including the clock generation circuit is fabricated using 0. 13 - m CMOS technology. To measure the synchronizing error of the clock generation circuit, the test elements group (TEG) system is designed and fabricated with the main system. The synchronizing error of the clock generation circuit is far smaller than the <b>delay</b> time of <b>unit</b> <b>delay</b> stage at zero phase locking and similar to the <b>delay</b> time of <b>unit</b> <b>delay</b> stage at multiphase locking.

40|$|Some {{applications}} {{require a}} highly-directive antenna array {{which has to}} scan the main beam over a limited-field-of-view (LFOV) angular sector. The phase control over the radiating aperture can be achieved with phase-shifters or time <b>delay</b> <b>units</b> (TDUs). Due to their cost and bulkiness time <b>delay</b> <b>units</b> can be hardly employed at element level and their number needs to be minimized as much as possible. On the other hand, the use of phase shifters may cause a beam squint or a narrow band operation if compared to employing TDUs. A quite common solution adopted to overcome the aforementioned issues for such radiating structures relies on the employment of time-delayed subarrays for reducing the costs and allowing an easier practical realization. The present work investigates on the possible performance improvements provided by arrays organized into randomly-overlapped subarrays with respect to other subarray arrangements such as contiguous and uniformly-overlapped lattices...|$|R
