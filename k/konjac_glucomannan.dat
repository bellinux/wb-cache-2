To promote the application of spruce galactoglucomannans in, for example, food prod-ucts, it is vital to understand also the rheological behaviour of the mixtures of galactoglucomannans with other polysaccharides. Rheol-ogical measurements were applied to study the rheological properties of mixtures of spruce galactoglucomannans and high-molar-mass <b>konjac</b> <b>glucomannan,</b> xanthan, guar gum, locust bean gum, and carrageenan. Shear rate-dependence of viscosity and applicability of the Cox-Merz relationship of mixtures of spruce galactoglucomannans with the other polysaccharides were studied.

40|$|<b>Konjac</b> <b>glucomannans</b> {{have been}} widely {{considered}} in health food products although their hydrodynamic properties have been poorly understood. The weight-average molecular weight (Mw); sedimentation coefficient (s 020,w) and intrinsic viscosities ([Î·]) have been estimated for five different preparations. The decrease in both intrinsic viscosity and sedimentation coefficient with molecular weight enables the estimation of molecular flexibility in terms of persistence length (Lp) using the traditional Bohdanecky-Bushin and Yamakawa-Fujii analyses for intrinsic viscosity and sedimentation data respectively. However, this requires an assumption of the mass per unit length ML. Advantage can now be taken of a recent development in data interpretation which allows the estimation of Lp from combined intrinsic viscosity and sedimentation coefficient data and also an estimate for ML. Using this "global" procedure an estimate of (13 Â± 1) nm is found for Lp and a value of (330 Â± 10) g mol- 1 nm- 1 for ML [...] The value for Lp suggests a molecule of considerable flexibility, comparable to galactomannans (Lp âˆ¼ 8 - 10 nm) but not as flexible as pullulan (Lp âˆ¼ 1 - 2 nm).

The purified M 1 from B. circulans NT 6.7 was a dimeric protein and the pH and temperature optimum were 6.0 and 60  °C, respectively. The purified M 1 was specified to mannan substrates; konjac mannan, locust bean gum, ivory nut, guar gum and defatted copra meal. The M 1 was activated by Mn 2 +, Mg 2 +, and Cu 2 + and inhibited by EDTA. The purified M 1 hydrolyzed konjac mannan, locust bean gum and defatted copra meal into mannooligosaccharides. The ratio of mannobiose, mannotriose, mannotetraose, mannopentaose, mannohexaose (M 2 –M 6) was dependent on the substrates and tended to hydrolyze galactomannan (locust bean gum and defatted copra meal) into mannooligosaccharides rather than <b>glucomannan</b> (<b>konjac).</b> Therefore, purified M 1 could be galacto-mannanase, which is suitable for mannooligosaccharide preparation from copra meal.

The main ingredients of jelly candy are gelling agents, sweeteners, acidulants, coloring and flavorings. Gelling agents are the indispensable ingredients that give the gelatinous texture. Psyllium husk powder, <b>konjac</b> <b>glucomannan</b> and gellan gum are novel tested in jelly candy as gelling agents which can {{at the same time}} increase dietary fiber content of the candies. It was reported that psyllium husk powder and <b>konjac</b> <b>glucomannan</b> made jelly candy less sticky and springy. In this thesis, jelly candies were made with modified potato starch blended with psyllium husk powder, or <b>konjac</b> <b>glucomannan,</b> or gellan gum. The first aim is to study the effect of different contents of gellan gum on jelly candy properties. The second aim is to compare the effect of psyllium husk powder, <b>konjac</b> <b>glucomannan</b> and gellan gum on jelly candy properties. To achieve these goals, rheological properties of jelly candy mass was studied. Mechanical properties, water content and water activity of the jelly candy were analyzed directly after preparation. Mechanical analysis was made again after the jelly candies stored for two weeks. The raw data were analyzed by MATLAB and then computed by PLS. The results showed that, with the increasing of gellan gum content from 0 % to 0. 8 %, hardness, adhesiveness and elasticity of jelly candies increased. At the same time, yield stress, coefficient of consistency and thixotropy of candy mass also increased. Psyllium husk powder and <b>konjac</b> <b>glucomannan</b> decreased hardness, adhesiveness and elasticity of jelly candies when comparing with gellan gum.

In conclusion, increasing the content of gellan gum helped to make harder and more chewable jelly candies. The stability of gel structure was also increased and the flowing of candy mass became more difficult. When comparing with gellan gum, psyllium husk powder and <b>konjac</b> <b>glucomannan</b> contributed to softer and less chewable jelly candies.

A 1 : 2 : 1 (w/w/w) ratio of CTS:OKG:DFNa prepared {{at room temperature for}} 3 hours gave the highest % encapsulation efficiency (EE) of 95. 6 ± 0. 6 and resulted in a minimal release of DFNa (< 1 % over 2 h) in SGF (pH 1. 2) and a significantly improved sustained release in SIF (pH 7. 4) with ~ 6 % and 19 % release over 8 and 24 h, respectively), some 15 - and five-fold lower than that of the two commercial DFNa preparations, Diclosian and Voltaren. This formulation may be used for further study as a long term intestine {{controlled release}} drug model (at least 3 days) ...|$|E
40|$|Konjac {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} glucomannan crops worldwide. The breeding and genomic researches are largely limited by the genetic basis of Amorphophallus. In this study, the transcriptomes of A. konjac and A. bulbifer were constructed using a high-throughput Illumina sequencing platform. All 108, 651 unigenes with average lengths of 430 nt in A. konjac and 119, 678 unigenes with average lengths of 439 nt were generated from 54, 986, 020 reads and 52, 334, 098 reads after filtering and assembly, respectively. A total of 54, 453 transcripts in A. konjac and 55, 525 in A. bulbifier were annotated by comparison with Nr, Swiss-Prot, KEGG, and COG databases after removing exogenous contaminated sequences. A total of 80, 332 transcripts differentially expressed between A. konjac and A. bulbifer. The majority of the genes that are associated with <b>konjac</b> <b>glucomannan</b> biosynthetic pathway were identified. Besides, the small RNAs in A. konjac leaves were also obtained by deep sequencing technology. All of 5, 499, 903 sequences of small RNAs were obtained with the length range between 18 and 30 nt. The potential targets for the miRNAs were also predicted according to the konjac transcripts. Our study provides a systematic overview of the <b>konjac</b> <b>glucomannan</b> biosynthesis genes that are involved in konjac leaves and should facilitate further understanding of the crucial roles of carbohydrate synthesis and other important metabolis...|$|E
30|$|To {{investigate}} hydrolytic {{patterns of}} the secreted mannan degrading enzymes from the ID 04 - 0555 strain, reactions were measured based on TLC analysis using the culture supernatant. The culture supernatant from the ID 04 - 0555 strain was able to hydrolyze mannan polymers into oligosaccharides (Fig.  1 b–e). LBG was hydrolyzed into mannose and various types of oligosaccharides for 4  h, and trisaccharide {{was one of the}} major products. A similar degradation pattern was observed using ivory nut. The hydrolysis of glucomannan, such as the <b>konjac</b> <b>glucomannan</b> and porang potato, also produced various oligosaccharides with trisaccharides as main products.|$|E
30|$|One {{potential}} {{solution is}} to introduce other functional components into the self-assembled peptide systems to form complex hydrogels. Nanoparticles [25], graphene oxide [26], synthetic polymers [27], proteins [7, 28], and polysaccharides [22, 29] {{have been widely used}} as the functional components. For example, Stupp et al. reported the heparin-induced self-assembly of a peptide amphiphile into a polysaccharide–peptide hybrid hydrogel, which exhibited good performance in promoting angiogenesis [29]. Our group also created a self-assembling hybrid hydrogel composed of fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl-diphenylalanine (Fmoc-FF) peptide and <b>konjac</b> <b>glucomannan</b> (KGM), Fmoc-FF–KGM, which showed much higher stability than the Fmoc-FF hydrogel, and the controlled docetaxel release from this hybrid hydrogel was also achieved [22].|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the higher structure of <b>konjac</b> <b>glucomannan</b> (KGM) in the amorphous state and solution using a laser {{particle size analyzer}} and a water activity meter. The {{results show that the}} thermodynamic structures of native KGM were primarily composed of the lamella structure units, which involve both granular crystalline and amorphous regions, and that the connection zones of such units contained both loose and tight aggregation regions. The value of surface tension (σ) of native KGM, resting with the density of its hydroxyl groups’ self-association, was an important parameter to analyze the higher structures of native KGM in the thermodynamic swelling model of native KGM...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{antibacterial}} properties of <b>konjac</b> <b>glucomannan</b> (KGM) film containing two herb extracts (Atractylodes lancea and Saussurea lappa) at various concentrations was studied in this present work. This activity was tested against two pathogenic bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. The {{results showed that}} the mean value of inhibition zone diameter of incorporated films with Saussurea lappa extracts were higher than those incorporating Atractylodes lancea extracts for all concentrations. The film incorporated with S. lappa extract had higher antibacterial activity against both bacteria than incorporated with A. lamcea. For all these levels, {{it can be seen that}} the KGM film had satisfactory physical properties and antibacterial activities...|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} for making thermostable <b>konjac</b> <b>glucomannan</b> (KGM) gels was examined {{with a view}} to eventual use with fish mince to make restructured products. A gelation method was developed with 3 and 6 % (w/v) aqueous dispersions of glucomannan (ADG) by adding alkali v/v (NaOH or KOH) up to pH 11. 8 - 12 and then allowing it to set (1 hr at 30 Â°C and 4 hrs at 5 Â°C). Both 3 and 6 % are suitable concentrations and KOH and NaOH (at 0. 6 and 1 M) are the most suitable alkalis for deacetylation of the glucomannan at pH 11. 8 - 12. 0. Â© 2012 De Gruyter.

40|$|Abstract: The {{rheological}} properties of <b>konjac</b> <b>glucomannan</b> (KGM) solution were measured by HAAKE Rotational Rheometer, {{and the results}} indicated that KGM solution began to transform from Newtonian fluid to non-Newtonian fluid above 0. 10 wt%, which represented the overlap of molecular chains. When the concentration exceeded 1. 00 wt%, the entanglements of molecular chains became obvious, and the KGM sol formed. Furthermore, the rheological formulas of KGM solution were simulated very regularly, and the parameters of viscosity (η) and non-Newtonian index (n) held the relationship of exponential function to concentration (C), however, the consistency coefficient (κ) displayed a power function, then their concentration-dependence functions were as follows: η=- 0. 33 + 1. 17...|$|E
