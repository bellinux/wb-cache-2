5|$|In {{addition}} to antidotes, an important treatment for poisoning {{is the use}} of hemodialysis. Hemodialysis is used to enhance the removal of unmetabolized ethylene glycol, as well as its metabolites from the body. It {{has been shown to be}} highly effective in the removal of ethylene glycol and its metabolites from the blood. Hemodialysis also has the added benefit of correcting other metabolic <b>derangements</b> or supporting deteriorating kidney function. Hemodialysis is usually indicated in patients with severe metabolic acidosis (blood pH less than 7.3), kidney failure, severe electrolyte imbalance, or if the patient's condition is deteriorating despite treatment. Often both antidotal treatment and hemodialysis are used together in the treatment of poisoning. Because hemodialysis will also remove the antidotes from the blood, doses of antidotes need to be increased to compensate. If hemodialysis is not available, then peritoneal dialysis also removes ethylene glycol, although less efficiently.|$|E

25|$|Clarifications of the {{mesenteric}} anatomy have facilitated {{a clearer}} understanding of diseases involving the mesentery, examples of which include malrotation and Crohn's disease (CD). In CD, the mesentery is frequently thickened, rendering haemostasis challenging. In addition, fat wrapping—creeping fat—involves extension of mesenteric fat over {{the circumference of}} contiguous gastrointestinal tract, and this may indicate increased mesothelial plasticity. The relationship between mesenteric <b>derangements</b> and mucosal manifestations in CD points to a pathobiological overlap; some authors say that CD is mainly a mesenteric disorder that secondarily affects the GIT and systemic circulation.|$|E

40|$|SummaryIntroductionMeniscal {{damage is}} common in knee Osteoarthritis (OA) and {{predictive}} of structural progression, suggesting that their disruption {{plays a role in}} the development of OA. The bone marrow lesion (BML) is associated with pain and is a strong risk factor for structural progression. These lesions are associated with abnormal loading in a knee joint. Therefore, our hypothesis was that in those with symptomatic knee OA, large BMLs would be associated with ipsi-compartmental meniscal <b>derangement.</b> MethodsThis was a cross-sectional study of a subsample of the Osteoarthritis Initiative where one set of magnetic resonance (MR) images from each participant was scored for tibiofemoral BMLs and meniscal <b>derangement.</b> We performed chi-squared tests comparing the prevalence of large BMLs in those with ipsi-compartmental meniscal <b>derangement</b> and those without. Results 160 Participants had a mean age of 61 (± 9. 9), mean BMI of 30. 3 (± 4. 7) and 50 % were female. 79 % of medial and 39 % of lateral menisci showed MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) <b>derangement.</b> In those with medial meniscal MRI <b>derangement,</b> 44 % had large medial BMLs while in those without medial meniscal <b>derangement,</b> 0 % had large BMLs.

40|$|Purpose: This article {{describes}} the clinical and imaging findings in the temporomandibular joints (TMJs) of patients 30 years after the initial diagnosis of osteoarthrosis and internal <b>derangement.</b> Patients and Methods: Fifty-five TMJs {{with a history of}} osteoarthrosis and internal <b>derangement</b> and 37 contralateral TMJs that were asymptomatic 30 years ago were examined in 46 former patients. To visualize degenerative changes of the bony parts of the TMJ, transpharyngeal and transcranial radiographs were made; to visualize disc position, sagittal T 1 -weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images were made. For comparison, 22 TMJs of an age-matched control group without complaints related to the masticatory system were similarly examined. Results: Thirty years after the initial diagnosis of osteoarthrosis and internal <b>derangement,</b> clinical signs in former patients hardly differed from those of control subjects. Radiographic signs were significantly more common and more severe in former patients. A high percentage of osteoarthrosis and internal <b>derangement</b> was seen on MRI in both TMJs with a history of osteoarthrosis and internal <b>derangement</b> and in the contralateral TMJs. it appeared that osteoarthrosis and internal <b>derangement</b> in the contralateral TMJs had developed asymptomatically in most cases. None of the patients had required treatment for the contralateral TMJ; only one fourth of the patients had noticed symptoms. In the control subjects, osteoarthrosis and internal <b>derangement</b> were infrequently seen. A significant correlation was found between disc position and the severity of radiographically detectable degenerative changes of the TMJ. Conclusions: It was concluded that 30 years after initial diagnosis there were few clinical signs of osteoarthrosis and internal <b>derangement,</b> although radiographic signs were extensive. Bilateral osteoarthrosis and internal <b>derangement,</b> with one symptomatic and one asymptomatic TMJ, is a common phenomenon. Moderate to severe radiographically detectable degenerative changes may be the only sign of an underlying internal <b>derangement...</b>|$|R
25|$|Recent radiologic appraisals of the {{mesenteric}} organ {{have been}} conducted {{in the context of}} the contemporary understanding of mesenteric organ anatomy. When this organ is divided into non-flexural and flexural regions, these can readily be differentiated in most patients on CT imaging. Clarification of the radiological appearance of the human mesentery resonates with the suggestions of Dodd and enables a clearer conceptualization of mesenteric <b>derangements</b> in disease states. This is of immediate relevance in the spread of cancer from colon cancer and perforated diverticular disease, and in pancreatitis where fluid collections in the lesser sac dissect the mesocolon from the retroperitoneum and thereby extend distally within the latter.|$|E
25|$|As an undergraduate, Whitworth {{became the}} {{founding}} {{editor in chief}} of the Messenger of Mathematics, and he continued as its editor until 1880. He published works about the logarithmic spiral and about trilinear coordinates, but his most famous mathematical publication is the book Choice and Chance: An Elementary Treatise on Permutations, Combinations, and Probability (first published in 1867 and extended over several later editions). The first edition of the book treated the subject primarily from the point of view of arithmetic calculations, but had an appendix on algebra, and was based on lectures he had given at Queen's College. Later editions added material on enumerative combinatorics (the numbers of ways of arranging items into groups with various constraints), <b>derangements,</b> frequentist probability, life expectancy, and the fairness of bets, among other topics.|$|E
25|$|When {{patients}} are taking multiple medications, the discontinuation of drugs suspected of causing myoclonus {{and treatment of}} metabolic <b>derangements</b> may resolve some cases of myoclonus. When pharmacological treatment is indicated anticonvulsants are the main line of treatment. Paradoxical reactions to treatment are notable. Drugs which most people respond to may in other individuals worsen their symptoms. Sometimes {{this leads to the}} mistake of increasing the dose, rather than decreasing or stopping the drug. Treatment of myoclonus focuses on medications that may help reduce symptoms. Drugs used include sodium valproate, clonazepam, the anticonvulsant levetiracetam, and piracetam. Dosages of clonazepam usually are increased gradually until the patient improves or side effects become harmful. Drowsiness and loss of coordination are common side effects. The beneficial effects of clonazepam may diminish over time if the patient develops a tolerance to the drug.|$|E
40|$|Dedicated to Anders Björner on the {{occasion}} of his sixtieth birthday Based on the notion of excedances of type B introduced by Brenti, we give a type B analogue of the <b>derangement</b> polynomials. The connection between the <b>derangement</b> polynomials and Eulerian polynomials naturally extends to the type B case. Using this relation, we derive some basic properties of the <b>derangement</b> polynomials of type B, including the generating function formula, the Sturm sequence property, and the asymptotic normal distribution. We also show that the <b>derangement</b> polynomials are almost symmetric {{in the sense that the}} coefficients possess the spiral property. ...|$|R
