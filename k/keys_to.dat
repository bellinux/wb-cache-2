5|$|The AACS Licensing Authority (LA) assigns {{a series}} of 253 unique {{cryptographic}} <b>keys</b> <b>to</b> device manufacturers. When an AACS protected disc is manufactured, {{a series of}} up to 64 keys called title keys are generated and the video content on the disc is encrypted using these keys. The title keys are stored on the disc and themselves encrypted with another key called the volume unique key. The volume unique key for any disc can be calculated by all authorized devices using another key called a processing key, which is derived from a media key block stored on each disc. Authorized devices use {{one or more of}} the manufacturer's assigned device <b>keys</b> <b>to</b> decrypt the media key block, yielding a processing key and enabling further decryption of the volume and title keys, and finally the content.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Gladys {{became a}} {{tropical}} storm, the NHC issued gale warnings for the Florida Keys {{and later a}} hurricane watch for the southwest Florida coast from the Florida <b>Keys</b> <b>to</b> Clearwater. After Gladys entered the Gulf of Mexico, the NHC issued hurricane warnings for the Florida <b>Keys</b> <b>to</b> Cedar Key, with a watch to St. Marks. Later, hurricane warnings were issued from Charleston, South Carolina to Hatteras, North Carolina. Before Gladys made landfall in Florida, all schools in Pinellas County were closed, and officials evacuated 60jet fighters from MacDill Air Force Base to Mississippi. The HMS Sirius, which was visiting St. Petersburg, rode out the storm in the open Gulf of Mexico. The American Red Cross opened shelters across western Florida for people to stay in during the storm, and about 40,000people evacuated their homes during the storm's passage. Then-governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. ordered 100Florida guardsmen to assist with storm work. Shelters were set up in North Carolina, although few people evacuated.|$|E

5|$|The Steam store also enables {{users to}} redeem store product <b>keys</b> <b>to</b> add {{software}} from their library. The keys are sold by third-party providers such as Humble Bundle (in which {{a portion of}} the sale is given back to the publisher or distributor), distributed as part of a physical release to redeem the game, or given to a user as part of promotions, often used to deliver Kickstarter and other crowd funding rewards. A grey market exists around Steam keys, where less reputable buyers purchase a large number of Steam keys for a game when it is offered for a low cost, and then resell these <b>keys</b> <b>to</b> users or other third-party sites at a higher price, generating profit for themselves. This caused some of these third-party sites, like G2A, to be embroiled in this grey market. It is possible for publishers to have Valve to track down where specific keys have been used and cancel them, removing the product from the user's libraries, leaving the user to seek any recourse with the third-party they purchased from. Other legitimate storefronts, like Humble Bundle, have set a minimum price that must be spent to obtain Steam keys as to discourage mass purchases that would enter the grey market.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} this {{certainty}} was that the investigation was poorly conducted. The crime scene was not secured and searched thoroughly, and evidence was not recorded or preserved. Within a couple of days, the police had burned the bloodstained bedding and carpets, apparently to spare Bamber's feelings.

Three days after the killings, Bamber and the extended family were given back the <b>keys</b> <b>to</b> the house.|$|E
5|$|Advisories, {{along with}} {{coordination}} between the National Observatory at Havana and U.S. Weather Bureau, were credited for the reduced deaths in Cuba. Weather observations were also readily available from Cuban meteorological stations. On October 25, the cyclone's hurricane force winds {{were expected to}} remain off the Florida east coast, although gale-force winds were anticipated from the Florida <b>Keys</b> <b>to</b> Palm Beach, Florida. Accordingly, storm warnings were issued from Key West, Florida to Vero Beach, Florida. Military aircraft were transported to safer locations, while watercraft were stored in harbors and rivers. Hotels and resorts were boarded up on the barrier islands. The Bahamas received warnings {{well in advance of}} the hurricane. The hurricane turned quickly to the east, which reduced the threat to Bimini, Cat Cay, Grand Bahama, and the Abaco Islands.|$|E

5|$|After 1530, it was {{the colonists}} {{themselves}} who held the <b>keys</b> <b>to</b> power, installing new governors and removing them from office. By 1534, the Spanish colony in Honduras was close to collapse.

The Spanish were beset by infighting, and had provoked widespread indigenous uprisings. Simultaneously, the native population had collapsed as a result of disease, mistreatment, and the export of large numbers to work on the sugar plantations of the Caribbean islands.|$|E
