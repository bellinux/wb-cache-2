Now about jazzing up the campaign for prospects: they've already used contesting teams, and given prizes to the kids that bring in the most members. And they made a mistake there: the prizes were a lot of folderols and doodads like poetry books and illustrated Testaments, instead of something a real live kid would want to work for, like real cash or a speedometer for his motor cycle. Course I suppose it's all fine and dandy to illustrate the lessons with these decorated book-marks and blackboard drawings and so on, but when it comes down to real he-hustling, getting out and drumming up customers--or members, I mean, why, you <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> worth a fellow's while.|$|E

[...] "Look at the churches themselves! No church can do any good till it's on a paying basis. As long as a church is in debt, it can't secure the best talent for the pulpit or the choir, and the members go about feeling {{discouraged}} and out of heart. It's just so with a newspaper. I say that a paper does no good till it pays; it has no influence, its motives are always suspected, and you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> pay by hook or by crook, before you can hope to--to--forward any good cause by it. That's what I say. Of course," [...] he added, in a large, smooth way, [...] "I'm not going to contend that a newspaper should be run solely {{in the interest of}} the counting-room. Not at all! But I do contend that, when the counting-room protests against a certain course the editorial room is taking, it ought to be respectfully listened to. There are always two sides to every question. Suppose all the newspapers pitch in--as they sometimes do--and denounce a certain public enterprise: a projected scheme of railroad legislation, or a peculiar system of banking, or a co-operative mining interest, and the counting-room sends up word that the company advertises heavily with us; shall we go and join indiscriminately in that hue and cry, or shall we give our friends the benefit of the doubt?" ...|$|E

[...] The Quietus reviewer James Ubaghs observed that:"A reoccurring feature {{is the way that}} vocal samples frequently sound like synths, and synths sound almost like vocals, on the verge of attaining sentience.

50|$|At {{the start}} Senna {{took the lead}} from the two Williams-Renaults with Mansell getting ahead of Patrese then Berger, Schumacher, Herbert and Brundle. For the first 13 laps the top 8 {{followed}} in close attention until next lap 14 Mansell tried to overtake Senna at the last chicane but the car ended off track and spun {{and came to a}} stop on the main straight. The Williams driver was out of the race and accusing Senna of pushing him off. As this was happening Berger had <b>got</b> Patrese <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> a McLaren 1-2. Lap 18 saw the exit of Capelli who crashed hard into the wall on the exit of turn 4. On lap 37 Senna retired from the lead with electrical problems. Berger had by now pulled a couple of seconds lead on Patrese who was being chased by Brundle after the Englishman had taken advantage of Schumacher getting stuck behind Morbidelli's Minardi while lapping him. A few laps later Patrese was out as his gearbox failed. Brundle now chased after Berger and set fastest lap but then was also forced to retire with transmission problems. Berger was in comfortable lead followed by Schumacher. Katayama was driving a good race but had to retire from 5th on lap 61 when his engine expired.|$|R

50|$|An 1837 decree {{allowed the}} town of LaGrange to be platted, and land claimed all around it by the LaGrange brothers. Not much is known about this decree except that it allowed land to be claimed just by platting a town. The trail herds passing through LaGrange were a source of cattle for people who legally or {{illegally}} acquired land to graze them on. Stories abound of these early day residents but few can be documented. Most permanent type residents did not arrive as early as 1837, but after about 1860 {{a number of people}} came to Wyoming for various reasons. Quite a few took out homesteads at this time. In the early spring of 1889, S. J. Robb, a Wyoming cowboy, and Nels Robertson who owned a store in neighboring Banner County, formed a company to start a merchandising business. Kale LaGrange, owner and founder of the Miskimins ranch gave them inducements to locate on the present site of LaGrange, it being a part of the ranch. The town was named for him. A store building was built as was a home for the manager, S. J. Robb. Far-sighted Easterners began to move into the area, secured a mail route from Pine Bluffs and <b>got</b> set <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> a magic city of the plains.|$|R
25|$|The {{last game}} of the season saw Middlesbrough play Manchester City. They started in next season's kit. After quarter of an hour, City captain Richard Dunne brought down Tuncay in the box to give the home side their second penalty of the season, which saw Dunne sent off. Stewart Downing, who started every league {{game of the}} season, {{converted}} the penalty for his ninth goal of the season. Alves got his fourth of the season on 37 minutes. In the second half, Downing <b>got</b> another <b>to</b> <b>make</b> double figures for the season, and mark the first time Boro had scored more than two goals in one game since the last game of the previous season. It got better when Alves got his second just minutes later. Johnson made it five on 70 minutes. Anthony McMahon made his first appearance of the season coming on as a sub for Luke Young with 15 minutes to play. Rochemback scored a thirty-yard free kick <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> six with his first goal of the season. Jérémie Aliadière <b>got</b> another <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> seven. Elano <b>got</b> a consolation goal, before Afonso Alves completed a hat-trick to give Boro an emphatic 8–1 win. The game was the first time Boro had scored eight in a game since 1974, and {{the first time in the}} top flight since 1950. Alves' third goal was the 500th Boro goal in all competitions at the Riverside, and the 1,000th in the Premier League this season, as well as the club's 600th Premier League goal. It also saw the first time Boro registered five different goalscorers since 1939.|$|R

50|$|During {{her time}} at UC Berkeley, Waters became {{active in the}} Free Speech Movement, which was {{sweeping}} across the campus. In response to a campus-wide ban on political involvement and activism, Berkeley students joined together to form the Free Speech Movement. One of the student leaders of this movement, Mario Savio, had a profound influence on Waters. Savio became famous in 1964 for delivering a speech, inciting individual student protesters {{to take action against}} the “machine” of political oppression. In his Sproul Hall Steps speech he said: “There’s a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious…And you’ve got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you’ve <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> stop”. Although her political aims have shifted, her approach to provoking change has remained constant over her tenure at Chez Panisse.|$|E

In protests unprecedented in this scope at the time, students insisted that the university administration lift the ban of on-campus political activities and acknowledge the students' right to free speech and academic freedom. In particular, on 2 December 1964 on the steps of Sproul Hall, Mario Savio gave a famous speech: [...] "But we're a bunch of raw materials that don't mean to be—have any process upon us. Don't mean to be made into any product! Don't mean—Don't mean to end up being bought by some clients of the University, be they the government, be they industry, be they organized labor, be they anyone! We're human beings!...There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious—makes you so sick at heart—that you can't take part. You can't even passively take part. And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> stop. And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it, that unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all." ...|$|E

If he had never been so happy as when the Doctor read that marvellous performance, the Dictionary, to him; he was now quite miserable unless the Doctor pulled it out of his pocket, and began. When the Doctor and I were engaged, he now fell into the custom of walking up and down with Mrs. Strong, and helping her to trim her favourite flowers, or weed the beds. I dare say he rarely spoke a dozen words in an hour: but his quiet interest, and his wistful face, found immediate response in both their breasts; each knew that the other liked him, and that he loved both; and he became what no one else could be--a link between them.|$|R
