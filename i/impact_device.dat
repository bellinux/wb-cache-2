40|$|Two {{experimental}} {{devices were}} designed and manufactured {{to study the}} use of mechanical impact and rubbing (friction and compression) to thresh soybeans pods. Threshing efficiency and seed damage were evaluated. The energy absorbed by pods as they shatter and the energy required to operate both devices were estimated and compared with the energy used by conventional combines to thresh soybeans. ^ The <b>impact</b> <b>device</b> was basically made of two parallel walls which hit the plants in a transverse reciprocating motion. The rubbing device connected pairs of vertical rollers driving two, facing each other, endless belts at different speeds and with adjustable gaps between them. The plants were fed either between the walls or belts to simulate the movement of both devices over a row of plants. ^ The <b>impact</b> <b>device</b> threshed 92. 5 % of the soybeans. Threshing efficiency increased significantly with decreasing levels of pod moisture content. The seed damage was within acceptable levels despite the trend to increase with increasing impact speeds and decreasing pod moisture content. The estimated energy absorbed per pod at 10 % moisture content was 0. 0127 J. The energy used by conventional combines was 20 % higher than that required by the <b>impact</b> <b>device,</b> and around 30 {{times higher than the}} total energy absorbed by pods during shattering. ^ The rubbing device threshed over 92. 5 % of the soybeans from 10 % moisture pods at any belt speed. There was no significant seed mechanical damage. The energy absorbed per pod was 0. 0123 J. The energy used by conventional combines was over 100 times higher than that absorbed by pods as they shattered, 12 times higher than that required by plants (pods and stems), and more than 4 times that required by the rubbing device. ^ Both devices performed satisfactory threshing with little seed mechanical damage and a relatively low level of energy consumption. These results support the conclusion that there is potential to improve soybean harvesting equipment. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to describe a simple device for detecting the time of an impact and to demonstrate its efficiency in measuring the depth of surface-opening cracks in concrete. Surface-opening cracks in concrete are relatively deep so that a mechanical impact instead of an ultrasonic transmitter is used to generate stress waves with enough energy for successful evaluation. A technique called the time-of-flight diffraction technique with impact-generated stress waves is an efficient method for detection of surface-opening cracks in concrete. Because the initial time of the impact is unavailable in a mechanical <b>impact</b> <b>device,</b> two receivers are employed in the test. One of the receivers is used to determine the time of the impact indirectly. The present study developed a simple device to record the time of impact initiation. The device comprises a conductive <b>impact</b> <b>device,</b> a sensing film, and an auxiliary circuit. With the device, stress waves are generated and the time of impact is detected so that the evaluation work needs only a single receiver. Laboratory studies were carried out on concrete specimens containing cracks with depths of 0. 158 and 0. 90 m. Field studies were performed on a dam damaged by an earthquake. Experimental results show that the new device can be used to accurately determine the crack depth in concrete. Using the device, the cost and effort for evaluation and signal analysis are reduced, which largely enhances the evaluation efficiency. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
