5|$|Most {{settlers}} in every colony were small farmers, but other industries developed {{within a few}} decades {{as varied as the}} settlements. Cash crops included tobacco, rice and wheat. Extraction industries grew up in furs, fishing and lumber. Manufacturers produced rum and ships, and by the late colonial period Americans were producing one-seventh of the world's iron supply. Cities eventually <b>dotted</b> <b>the</b> coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs. English colonists were supplemented by waves of Scotch-Irish and other groups.

40|$|We {{have studied}} small InP quantum dots in a GaInP matrix {{theoretically}} and experimentally. Using low-temperature photoluminescence spectroscopy {{in conjunction with}} six band k. p calculations, including direct and exchange interactions, we show that <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> size is a crucial parameter that determines whether <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> is neutral or charged with electrons in the nominally undoped n-type host material. For a small enough quantum <b>dot,</b> <b>the</b> conduction-band ground state is positioned above the Fermi level and <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> remains neutral. However, as soon as <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> is large enough for the conduction-band ground state to be located below the Fermi level <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> is charged. Furthermore, we show that, for neutral quantum <b>dots,</b> <b>the</b> position of the bi-exciton emission line {{with respect to the}} exciton emission line depends on the size of <b>the</b> quantum <b>dot</b> and that <b>the</b> bi-exciton emission can be {{on either side of the}} exciton emission: for <b>the</b> smallest <b>dots</b> <b>the</b> bi-exciton emission is always at higher energy than the exciton emission but for larger <b>dots</b> <b>the</b> ordering is the opposite with the exciton emission line on the high-energy side...|$|R
40|$|A double-quantum-dot {{coupled to}} {{electrodes}} with spin-dependent splitting of chemical potentials (spin bias) is investigated theoretically {{by means of}} the Green's functions formalism. By applying a large spin bias, the quantum spin in a quantum <b>dot</b> (<b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 1) can be manipulated in a fully electrical manner. To noninvasively monitor the manipulation of the quantum spin in <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 1, it is proposed that <b>the</b> second quantum <b>dot</b> (<b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 2) is weakly coupled to <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 1. In <b>the</b> presence of the exchange interaction between <b>the</b> two <b>dots,</b> <b>the</b> polarized spin in <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 1 behaves like an effective magnetic field and weakly polarizes the spin in <b>the</b> nearby quantum <b>dot</b> 2. By applying a very small spin bias to <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 2, <b>the</b> spin-dependent transport through <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 2 can be probed, allowing the spin polarization in <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 1 to be identified nondestructively. These two steps form a complete scheme to manipulate a trapped spin while permitting this manipulation to be monitored in the double-dot system using pure electric approaches...|$|R
5|$|Russel {{estimated}} the Egyptian village population to be 3.3 million in 2,300 villages, a high density for rural {{populations in the}} time period. He attributes it to the high productivity of Egyptian soil which allowed for increased agricultural growth. The urban population was much lower, 233,100, consisting of 5.7% of the total Egyptian population. The largest cities were Cairo (pop.60,000), Alexandria (pop.30,000), Qus (pop.25,000), Damietta (pop.18,000), Fayyum (pop.13,000), and Bilbeis (pop.10,000). Numerous smaller cities <b>dotted</b> <b>the</b> Nile River. Among the latter were Damanhur, Asyut, and Tanta. Cities in Egypt were also densely populated, mainly because of greater urbanization and industrialization than elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Hammurabi was an Amorite First Dynasty {{king of the}} {{city-state}} of Babylon, and {{inherited the}} power from his father, Sin-Muballit, in c. 1792 BC. Babylon {{was one of the}} many largely Amorite ruled city-states that <b>dotted</b> <b>the</b> central and southern Mesopotamian plains and waged war on each other for control of fertile agricultural land. Though many cultures co-existed in Mesopotamia, Babylonian culture gained a degree of prominence among the literate classes throughout the Middle East under Hammurabi. The kings who came before Hammurabi had founded a relatively minor City State in 1894 BC which controlled little territory outside of the city itself. Babylon was overshadowed by older, larger and more powerful kingdoms such as Elam, Assyria, Isin, Eshnunna and Larsa for a century or so after its founding. However his father Sin-Muballit had begun to consolidate rule of a small area of south central Mesopotamia under Babylonian hegemony and, by the time of his reign, had conquered the minor city-states of Borsippa, Kish, and Sippar.|$|E
5|$|In April 1989, Voight {{returned}} to Colombia to the volcano Galeras after being {{contacted by the}} United Nations Disaster Relief Organization. People in Pasto, located {{at the foot of}} the volcano, had become alarmed by noises and shaking from Galeras. While Galeras proved far easier to climb than Nevado del Ruiz, land mines planted to hinder guerrilla forces <b>dotted</b> <b>the</b> slopes of the mountain. With USGS geologist Dick Janda, Voight drew a hazard map that included several populated areas within the danger zone. Before Voight left Galeras, the volcano underwent an unexpected phreatic eruption, which Voight and his team failed to predict. Although Pasto was unaffected, six scientists attending a United Nations workshop for natural disaster relief were killed. After reviewing deformation data from the day before the eruption, Voight discovered that no acceleration in the deformation process had occurred. He surmised that phreatic eruptions do not exhibit an acceleration in deformation before taking place and left after confirming that the volcano's monitoring system functioned properly.|$|E

5|$|The Egyptians worked {{deposits}} {{of the lead}} ore galena at Gebel Rosas to make net sinkers, plumb bobs, and small figurines. Copper {{was the most important}} metal for toolmaking in ancient Egypt and was smelted in furnaces from malachite ore mined in the Sinai. Workers collected gold by washing the nuggets out of sediment in alluvial deposits, or by the more labor-intensive process of grinding and washing gold-bearing quartzite. Iron deposits found in upper Egypt were utilized in the Late Period. High-quality building stones were abundant in Egypt; the ancient Egyptians quarried limestone all along the Nile valley, granite from Aswan, and basalt and sandstone from the wadis of the eastern desert. Deposits of decorative stones such as porphyry, greywacke, alabaster, and carnelian <b>dotted</b> <b>the</b> eastern desert and were collected even before the First Dynasty.
