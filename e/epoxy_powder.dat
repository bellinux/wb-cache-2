50|$|Fusion bonded epoxy coating, {{also known}} as fusion-bond <b>epoxy</b> <b>powder</b> coating and {{commonly}} referred to as FBE coating, is an epoxy-based powder coating that is widely used to protect steel pipe used in pipeline construction, concrete reinforcing bars (rebar) and {{on a wide variety of}} piping connections, valves etc. from corrosion. FBE coatings are thermoset polymer coatings. They come under the category of protective coatings in paints and coating nomenclature. The name fusion-bond epoxy is due to resin cross-linking and the application method, which is different from a conventional paint. The resin and hardener components in the dry powder FBE stock remain unreacted at normal storage conditions. At typical coating application temperatures, usually in the range of 180 to 250 C, the contents of the powder melt and transform to a liquid form. The liquid FBE film wets and flows onto the steel surface on which it is applied, and soon becomes a solid coating by chemical cross-linking, assisted by heat. This process is known as “fusion bonding”. The chemical cross-linking reaction taking place in this case is irreversible. Once the curing takes place, the coating cannot be returned to its original form by any means. Application of further heating will not “melt” the coating and thus it is known as a “thermoset” coating. The world's leading FBE manufacturers are Valspar, SolEpoxy (former Henkel/Dexter), KCC Corporation, Jotun Powder Coatings, Sherwin-Williams, 3M, Axalta Coating Systems, Akzo Nobel, BASF, Manifa Paints and Powder Coatings and Rohm & Haas.|$|E
5000|$|Polyester epoxies {{are used}} as powder {{coatings}} for washers, driers and other [...] "white goods". Fusion Bonded <b>Epoxy</b> <b>Powder</b> Coatings (FBE) are extensively used for corrosion protection of steel pipes and fittings used in {{the oil and gas}} industry, potable water transmission pipelines (steel), and concrete reinforcing rebar. Epoxy coatings are also widely used as primers to improve the adhesion of automotive and marine paints especially on metal surfaces where corrosion (rusting) resistance is important. Metal cans and containers are often coated with epoxy to prevent rusting, especially for foods like tomatoes that are acidic. Epoxy resins are also used for decorative flooring applications such as terrazzo flooring, chip flooring, and colored aggregate flooring.Epoxies were modified in a variety of ways, Reacted with fatty acids derived from oils to yield epoxy esters, which were cured the same way as alkyds [...] Typical ones were L8(80% linseed, D4 (40% Dehydrated castor oil). These were often reacted with styrene to make styrenated epoxy esters, used as primers. Curing with phenolics to make drum linings, curing esters with amine resins and pre-curing epoxies with amino resins to make resistant top coats. One of the best examples was a system of using solvent free epoxies for priming ships during construction, this used a system of hot airless spray with premixing at the head. This obviated the problem of solvent retention under the film, which caused adhesion problems later on.|$|E

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the coating properties in terms of scratch and wear resistance is extremely important to prevent severe damage. This paper focused {{on the study of}} a comparative evaluation of the scratch and wear performance of two thermosetting powder coatings filled with different weight fractions of molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2) solid lubricant. Indeed, the thermoset polyester and <b>epoxy</b> organic <b>powder</b> were deposited onto aluminum substrates by an electrostatic spray coating process. The effect of MoS 2 solid lubricant on the friction and wear behavior of both polyester and <b>epoxy</b> composite <b>powder</b> coatings were assessed via reciprocating tribometer under dry friction conditions. The micro-mechanical performance of the scratch resistance of the composite coatings was conducted using progressive load scratch tests. The experimental findings of the tribological analysis have proven a significant reduction of the friction coefficient and a higher anti-wear ability of the polyester composite coatings compared with the epoxy matrix to which the addition of MoS 2 particles has a little effect on the friction-reducing mechanism. Finally, the investigation of the scratch resistance of the polyester or <b>epoxy</b> composite <b>powder</b> coatings filled with MoS 2 confirms that the incorporation of MoS 2 particles to either polyester or epoxy matrices leads to a significant decrease of the critical loads characterizing the coating damage. From the residual depth trends and contact pressure analyses, the epoxy composite coatings reinforced by 5 wt. % of MoS 2 are found to have a great scratch resistance response compared to the polyester composite reinforced by the same wt. % of MoS 2. © 2015 Elsevier B.

40|$|Electrostatic powder {{deposition}} {{is widely}} used in a plethora of industrial-applications ranging from the pharmaceutical and food. industries, to farm equipment and automotive applications. The disadvantages of this technique are possible back corona (pin-like formations) onset and the Faraday penetration limitation (when the powder does not penetrate in some recessed areas). A possible solution {{to overcome these problems}} is to use tribochargers to electrostatically charge the powder. Tribocharging, or contact charging while two materials are in contact, is related to the work function difference between the contacting materials and generates bipolarly charged particles. The generation of an ion-free powder cloud by tribocharging with high bipolar charge and an overall charge density of almost zero, provides a better coverage of the recessed areas. In this study, acrylic and <b>epoxy</b> <b>powders</b> were fluidized and charged by passing through stainless steel, copper, aluminum, and polycarbonate static mixers, respectively. The particle velocity was varied to determine its effect on the net charge-to-mass ratio (QIM) acquired by the powders.

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{effective}} ways to prevent damage from occurring to taxidermy collections is to establish a monitoring system or procedure that routinely checks the condition of specimens. When not on display, taxidermy specimens should be housed in well-sealed cabinets or cases. Metal cabinets may be made of aluminum and/or stainless steel with an <b>epoxy</b> <b>powder</b> coating and are effective at preventing pest and light damage. Wood cabinets can provide better protection from fluctuations in relative humidity, though they off-gas chemicals that may damage collections. Though it is essential for cabinets and cases to be well-sealed, they should also allow for minimal airflow to prevent off-gassed chemicals or humidity from building up inside the container. For taxidermy specimens housed on open shelving, a polythene sheet can provide temporary protection from pollutants, though dust may accumulate electrostatically (2).Controlled lighting conditions with UV filters are important for reducing fading in taxidermy specimens. Specimens should be regularly rotated in order to reduce light damage. 50-100 lux is the recommended light exposure for taxidermy, though some types of feathers are susceptible to damage at 50 lux. The maximum annual exposure levels for biological specimens, feathers, fur, and leather is 180,000 lux hours. In the span of one year, a taxidermy mount will fade half as much if displayed in low light compared to the same conditions in high light. Ideal relative humidity conditions for taxidermy specimens are 40% minimum and 55% maximum. An integrated pest management system is important to manage and monitor pests that can damage collections.|$|E

Different insulation systems were evaluated based on electrical, mechanical, ther­ mal, chemical and manufacturing properties as well as cost factors.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A new foaming {{process has}} been {{developed}} for epoxy resins. Uncured epoxy tablets are fabricated by pressing commercial powders in a steel mold at room temperature and used as foam precursors. The tablets foam when heated in a muffle at high temperature. No blowing agent was added because the foaming mechanism depends on the uncured resin boiling point. The foaming temperature is set to be high enough to rapidly produce the resin boiling but not excessive to avoid the thermal degradation. During boiling, the epoxy resin polymerizes and the bubbles freeze in the final structure. Epoxy foams are obtained by heating the compacted tablets in cylindrical copper molds, having internal diameter equal to the tablet diameter. Several process parameters have been changed in the experiment to understand their correlation with the foaming efficiency. However, the foaming ratio (expressed {{in terms of the}} ratio between the final and the initial tablet height) is found to be mainly dependent on the initial tablet density. In optimal conditions, the foaming ratio can rise up to 6. Thermal tests have been performed to evaluate the <b>epoxy</b> <b>powder</b> behavior during the cure, whereas mechanical compression tests were used to evaluate the final performances of the foams.

40|$|According to the {{experimental}} results and the basic concept that the capacitive contribution of the coating/metal system to EIS can reflect the change occurring at interface sensitively, the quantitative relationship between the adhesion and the analytical result of EIS is established. The approach is using the transmission line model (CR circuit) to obtain the discrete capacitance values, analyzing the physical meaning of the slope at the region in which the discrete capacitances change linearly with the discrete characteristic frequency. The data handling method is also given in detail. The relationship is validated by experiments. The results show that under certain conditions, the slopes are mainly determined by the speed of instantaneous delamination at organic coating/metal interface and are not influenced by the corrosion product built up at the artificial defect, so they have good reproducibility despite the EIS of duplicate samples showing very different configuration. The analytical results from EIS are often {{higher than that of}} mechanical measurements when adhesion is strong. Explanation of the discrepancy shows that the results from EIS are more accurate and reasonable.

40|$|An active {{approach}} for initiating rigidization in carbon-fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites unites electrical resistivity to mechanical stiffening. Temperature control is implemented {{in efforts to}} reduce the curing time of the composite and to increase control of the curing process. Specifically, proportional-integral (PI) feedback control of internal resistive (Joule) heating establishes an electrically-controlled, thermally-activated material. Precise temperature tracking (less than 1 o C error at steady state) was achieved for controlled sample heating tests. The rigidization of these materials was quantified and compared for different curing profiles by measuring the increase in bending stiffness as well as verifying resin cure completion with DSC.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{correlation}} between the thermo-rheological properties of a thermosetting powder coating system with its surface structure build-up. <b>Epoxy</b> <b>powder</b> coating systems, which displayed surface matting and surface wrinkling, were examined. Firstly, the evolution of the complex viscosity was correlated with the cure kinetic. Secondly, the structure build-up {{on the surface of the}} coatings was investigated with a combined SEM-CLA profilometry analysis at different stages of curing process for both EFB and CHDFB coating processes. Different finishes were found to characterize the films applied by using EFB and CHDFB coating processes as a result of the different way the film is heated by. Finally, a strict relationship of film morphology to the degree of conversion and to the evolution of the complex viscosity was found out for both EFB and CHDFB coating processes. The surface structure is built up after gelation point and continues to evolve after gelation with a full development of the film fine structure. Differences were observed in the surface structure build-up when different curing temperature was used, thereby indicating an influence of minimum viscosity on achievable finishing. These experimental results lead to further advances in a better understanding of the formation of surface topography and morphology of polymeric films. They also provide important indications for the settings of curing parameters in both EFB and CHDFB coating processes as well as for the development of new powder coating formulations. © 2007 Elsevier B.

Normally, the film thickness and powder coverage of the coated powder is not optimum. It leads to non- protection of the parts from rusty and corrosion besides having many defects such as orange peel, rough surface, poor adhesion and inconsistencies of colour tone. In order to produce good coating quality, the processing parameters must be optimized. In this research, there have three variable parameters need to investigate. The variable parameters are total air volume, powder output and spraying distances. These parameters were screening to determine the significant effects to the coating quality. The screening result shows the spraying distance does not have significant effects and it was discarded. The experiments were carrying out to determine the optimum combination of powder output and total air volume. It is purposely to produce sample with good coating quality besides improved the first pass transfer efficiency (FPTE). All samples were tested using same processes that are pre-treatment, dry-off, powder spraying and curing.

40|$|Fluidized bed coating (FBC) is {{a process}} where {{preheated}} material is dipped into a flowing liquid bed of powder. Although FBC has existed {{for more than half}} a century, however there is little knowledge about the fluidized bed design that gives excellent fluidization quality as well as reducing powder entrainment. The objectives of this thesis are to investigate the effect of two different types of distributor with different pressure drop on powder coating, hydrodynamics of fluidized bed coating process, and effect of flow rate on powder coating quality such as thickness, uniformity, reduced entrainment and current leakage. The understanding and research finding is the key to the design of an industrial scale fluidized bed powder coater. A pilot fluidized bed coater was designed and built to run the experimental work for the study on pressure drops and also coating experiments using <b>epoxy</b> <b>powder</b> on copper bars. Pure copper bars with a purity of 99. 99 % were used for coating. The quality of the coated samples such as the coating thickness and current leakage were evaluated. Continuous and repetitive dipping method was experimented to study on the coating thickness at different processing time. At a continuous dipping of 14 seconds, and with air flow rates of 3 LPM, 8 LPM and 12 LPM, the coating thickness achieved were 1079. 2 μm, 1275. 8 μm and 659. 2 μm respectively. Using repetitive method, overall coating thickness is lower than continuous coating at the same dipping time. The current leakage shows that low air flow rate for continuous dipping method has the lowest current leakage at the similar coating thickness at 720 μm compared to repetitive dipping method. Its leakage is 0. 53 mA compared to normal air flow rate at 0. 68 mA and high air flow rate at 0. 75 mA. Different dipping methods were studied to understand the difference between continuous dipping and repetitive dipping on the coating uniformity on the bar. It was found that continuous dipping gave a more uneven coating on the samples which can be observed through the large standard deviation error bar. Further study on the effect of different air distributor pressure drops was also carried out. Theoretically the pressure drop of distributor ratio against the bed height should be in the range of 0. 1 to 0. 3 to ensure a good bed rise with few bubbles.

THE MAXWELL-WAGNER-SILLARS EFFECTOR INTERFACIAL POLARIZATION IS EVIDENT IN THE LOW FREQUENCY RANGE, AND IT IS INCREASED WITH THE FILLER CONTENT, ESPECIALLY IN HYBRID COMPOSITES. COMPOSITES, WITH METAL POWDER, EXHIBIT HIGHER PERMITIVITY AND HIGHER DIELECTRIC LOSS THAN THE PURE RESIN. THE PRESENCE OF ARAMID FIBRES DOES NOT AFFECT SIGNIFICANTLY THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE SYSTEMS. AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES, CLOSE TO THE (TG) REGION, AN INCREASE OF DIELECTRIC LOSS IS OBSERVED, WHICH IS ATTRIBUTED TO AN A-RELAXATION PROCESS. IN THE HYBRID COMPOSITES THE ALUMINUM INFLUENCE IS STRONGER THAN THE INFLUENCE OF ARAMID FIBRES. A MODEL FOR THE DESCRIPTION OF THE DIELECTRIC BEHAVIOUR, OF COMPLEX SYSTEMS IS DEVELOPED. THE MODEL IS PRODUCED BY EXTENSION OF THE LOGARITHMIC LOW OF MIXTURES AND IT IS REFERING TO THE ABOVE COMPLEX SYSTEMS. THE APPLICABILITY OF THE MODEL IS TESTED WITH THE OBTAINED EXPERIMENTAL DATA. THE PROPOSED MODEL IS DISCUSSED AND CORRELATION BETWEEN THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL VALUES IS FOUND TO BE SATISFACTORY. ...|$|R
40|$|Two {{impedance}} tubes {{method was}} employed {{for measuring the}} Resonance Sonic crystals with high impedance, in the wavelength regime that is several times the physical size of the sample. By varying {{the length of the}} back impedance tube, the shifted resonant peak of the transmission amplitude shows the presence of multiple-reflection of the plane sound waves in the tube system. The method provides a reliable means to measure the complex transmittance even at resonant frequency of the tube. Low transmission amplitude including the important phase information can be measured by using high gain transmission sensor mounted in the back impedance tube. Due to cracking of the gypsum medium, a mixed medium of <b>epoxy</b> and gypsum <b>powder</b> was developed to hold the position of the coated spheres in the different orientations. Several sonic crystals embedded in either gypsum or in epoxy/gypsum mixture were fabricated in the geometries of [100], [110] or [111] directions. All the samples are measured from 100 Hz to 1200 Hz. Experimental data reveal transmission dips at low frequency region, showing acoustic insulation for low frequency. The experimental data are compared with theoretical predictions, and the results, including the discrepancies, are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{analysis}} of the electrostatic fluidized bed coating process of carbon steel thin sheets was performed using two different mesh-sized <b>epoxy</b> - polyester <b>powders.</b> In particular, systematic {{analysis of}} the influence of the operative variables on coating and process variability in the field of low film thickness (below 100 μm), was carried out, which for electrostatic fluidized beds has previously not been considered feasible. In this context, the effect of varying both the electrostatic and fluidized bed setting on the amount of the powder layer coating the work-piece surface was studied. In particular, exposure time, applied corona voltage, and airflow rate were found to influence the performance of the coating process significantly. Experimental results produced coating thickness trends consistent with theoretic expectations. In particular, effects on the coating process of both electric and aerodynamic forces, which in turn affect the powder particles drawn up to the work-piece surface could largely be predicted by examining experimental data. A set of 3 D maps of the coating thickness achieved are also reported as they provide a useful tool to monitor the process in a 5 - 15 s time range, applied voltage from 45 to 90 kV, and flow rate from 3 to 11 m 3 /h. © 2005 Elsevier B.
