40|$|AbstractIt {{is known}} that the {{incidence}} algebra of a finite poset <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>strongly</b> simply connected {{if and only if}} its quiver contains a crown. We give a combinatorial condition on crowns which, if satisfied, forces the incidence algebra to be simply connected. The converse <b>is</b> <b>not</b> true, but we show that a simply connected incidence algebra which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>strongly</b> simply connected always contains crowns satisfying this condition...|$|R
