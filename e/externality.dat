5|$|An {{emissions}} trading scheme for {{greenhouse gas emissions}} (GHGs) works by establishing property rights for the atmosphere. The atmosphere is a global public good, and GHG emissions are an international <b>externality</b> (p.21). The emissions from all sources of GHGs contribute to the overall stock of GHGs in the atmosphere. In the cap-and-trade variant of {{emissions trading}}, a limit on access to a resource (the cap) is defined and then allocated among users {{in the form of}} permits. Compliance is established by comparing actual emissions with permits surrendered including any permits traded within the cap. The environmental integrity of emissions trading is depends on the setting of the cap, not the decision to allow trading.|$|E

Static <b>externalities</b> refer to current period scale or industry-size effects which have been labeled localization <b>externalities</b> or region-size effects known as agglomeration <b>externalities.</b> Dynamic <b>externalities</b> refer to the relationship between accumulated or prior period knowledge and current levels of innovation, where past learning-by-doing makes innovation positively related to cumulative production over time. Our empirical specification allows for the presence of both static and dynamic <b>externalities,</b> and provides a way to assess the relative magnitude of spillovers associated with spillovers from these two types of knowledge <b>externalities.</b> The magnitude of own-region impacts and other-region (spillovers) can be assessed using scalar summary measures of the own- and cross-partial derivatives from the model.

The reward for {{being part of}} a group, society, and even the world through a P2P network {{is one of the greatest}} benefits that a modern common-pool resource can provide.The ability to connect and create with people from different cultures, ethnicities, and beliefs is something thought to be impossible 100 years ago. Without network <b>externality</b> this form of communication would have been impossible. Through P2P sharing the world as a culture are able to learn and teach each other through public forums. In Sugata Mitra’s Ted talk, “The child-driven education” he placed a computer in a third world town and left it there to see what would happen. To his amazement children were able to quickly figure out how to use the computer and educate themselves on its inner workings. This example is a benefit to society for several reasons. The first is the relationship between Sugata Mitra and the P2P network which led him to place the computer in a third world town, along with the ability to present his findings on a public forum. Secondly, it is those who consumed his ted talk and benefited from the knowledge that those in third world countries just need a chance to learn and they will take it. This experiment as a whole brings the culture of the world together and connects us with those we thought impossible due to the P2P network and network <b>externality</b> that led individuals to the Ted talk.|$|E

40|$|Coexistence of identity-specific and {{financial}} <b>externalities</b> among bidders is a salient feature of auctions with buyers who are cross shareholders or competing firms in an oligopoly. This paper unifies {{these two types}} of <b>externalities</b> in revenue-maximizing auction design. Our main findings are the following. First, {{these two types of}} <b>externalities</b> can be unified through the framework of Myerson (1981). Both affect the winning probabilities through their impact on players' externality-augmented virtual values, while their impact on buyers' payments is reflected by an externality-correcting component for each type of <b>externalities,</b> which equals the respective <b>externalities.</b> These components eliminate strategic bidding that would arise from the existence of <b>externalities.</b> Second, the two types of <b>externalities</b> interact fundamentally through shaping players' virtual values. At the optimum, the player with the highest externality-augmented virtual value wins given that it is positive, otherwise seller physically destroys the item. Financial <b>externalities</b> amplify the impact of the identity-specific <b>externalities</b> on winning probabilities. Third, our approach is applicable to revenue-maximizing auction design with cross shareholding. Fourth, our finding renders an approach for revenue-maximizing auction design with asymmetric financial <b>externalities.</b> Particularly, when seller does not value the object, a revenue-maximizing auction can be obtained from any revenue-maximizing auction for a regular setting without <b>externalities</b> by solely transforming the payments. ...|$|R

In anti-coordination games the resource is rivalrous but non-excludable and sharing comes at a cost (or negative <b>externality).</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{luxury tax}} applied to goods and {{services}} for conspicuous consumption {{is a type of}} progressive sales tax that at least partially corrects the negative <b>externality</b> associated with the conspicuous consumption of positional goods. In Utility from Accumulation (2009), Louis Kaplow said that assets exercise an objective social-utility function, i.e. the rich man and the rich woman hoard material assets, because the hoard, itself, functions as status goods that establish his and her socio-economic position within society. When utility is derived directly from accumulation of assets, this lowers the dead weight loss associated with inheritance taxes and raises the optimal rate of inheritance taxation.|$|E
