40|$|The article {{discusses}} the significant impact <b>electronic</b> <b>books</b> {{have had on}} collection management activities in academic libraries. With the advent of <b>electronic</b> <b>books,</b> book collections have {{become more and more}} mixed; it is time {{to take a step back}} and take a look at books in both formats to examine the trends that have emerged related to use and the benefits of each format. Using the experience at UNLV Libraries, the authors describe how UNLV developed a mixed format book collection by incorporating e-books in specific subjects based on curriculum and research needs into its print book collection. The article also discusses how e-books have impacted specific activities within libraries, such as selection and acquisitions, including a look at the role of vendors in the e-book arena. Finally, the authors compare and contrast how to evaluate print <b>books</b> and <b>electronic</b> <b>books</b> and which methods are used for collection assessment. Can traditional methods of assessment for print books be used for <b>electronic</b> <b>books?</b> If not, why, and which methods should be used to effectively evaluate <b>electronic</b> <b>books.</b> The article concludes with an overview of the future of e-books...|$|R

The market for erotic romances has been growing rapidly, leading some publishers to create new lines for these types of books. Some subjects are still considered taboo, even with erotic romance. Themes such as pedophilia, incest, and bestiality are discouraged by all publishers.|$|E
