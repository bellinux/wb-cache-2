This thesis explores the synthesis and reactivity of new ruthenium bis(germyl) and ruthenium (germyl) (hydride) complexes {{and the development}} of a new catalytic reaction for the synthesis of polygermanes, σ-conjugated polymers with interesting opto-electronic properties. Treatment of HGeMe 3 with catalytic amounts of (PMe 3) 4 Ru(GeMe 3) 2 at 25 °C leads to rapid loss of methane and formation of high molecular weight permethylpolygermanes. This unprecedented condensation process is somewhat analogous to dehydrogenative coupling. Branched chain permethylpolygermanes of high molecular weight (M w = 2. 5 x 104 – 1. 6 x 105) are obtained in nearly quantitative yields. The polygermanes were characterized by GPC, viscometry, Light Scattering, and chemical analysis. Although the active catalyst is (PMe 3) 4 Ru(GeMe 3) 2, a catalyst precursor, (PMe 3) 4 RuMe 2, can be con veniently used to generate the active species in situ. The high catalytic activity of (PMe 3) 4 Ru(GeMe 3) 2 is due in part to the extremely labile phosphine ligands, which facilitate generation of coordinatively unsaturated intermediates. A mechanism has been proposed which involves an α-methyl migration to generate a ruthenium (germylene) intermediate, followed by germyl to germylene migration as the Ge-Ge bond forming step. Other tertiary <b>germanes,</b> HGeMe 2 R (R=Et, nBu, Bz, Np), are also demethanatively coupled, but only oligomers are formed. In the case of <b>germanes</b> with alkyl groups containing B-hydrogens, catalysis is short-lived and is terminated by loss of olefin and formation of ruthenium (hydride) complexes. The catalysis of the latter two <b>germanes</b> appears to be limited by steric factors. In addition, a random copolymer,−(GeMe 2) x−(GeMePh) y−, was prepared by copolymerization of HGeMe 3 and HGeMe 2 Ph. ...|$|R

Installation of alkyl or terminal phosphide ligands trans to the anchoring silyl group affords the complexes [SiPPh 3]RuR (R = Me (2), CH_ 2 Ph (4), PPh_ 2 (5), P^iPr_ 2 (6)). Complexes 2, 4, and 5 are thermally unstable. Complexes 2 and 4 decay to the cyclometalated complex [SiP^(Ph) _ 2 P′^(Ph) ]Ru (3), whereas complex 5 decays to the cyclometalated phosphine adduct [SiP^(Ph) _ 2 P′^(Ph) ]Ru(PHPh_ 2) (7). Complex 3 is found to effect E−H (E = H, C, Si, Ge) bond activation of substrates such as secondary silanes and <b>germanes</b> to yield the structurally unusual silylene complexes [SiP^(Ph) _ 3]Ru(H) (SiRR′) (R = R′ = Ph (10 a), R = Ph R′ = Me (10 b)) and the germylene complex [SiP^(Ph) _ 3]Ru(H) (GeR_ 2) (R = Ph) (11) via double E−H activation transformations. Both theory and experiments suggest electrophilic character at the silylene moiety. Reaction of 3 with catecholborane, in contrast to silanes and <b>germanes,</b> results in insertion of the B−H unit into the M−C bond of the cyclometalated species to yield the borate complex [SiP^(Ph) _ 2 P^(Ph) -B(cat) ]Ru(μ-H) (14).

25|$|Transpersonal art {{is one of}} the {{disciplines}} considered by Boucovolas, in listing how transpersonal psychology may relate to other areas of transpersonal study. In writing about transpersonal art, Boucovolas begins by noting how, according to Breccia and also to the definitions employed by the International Transpersonal Association in 1971, transpersonal art may be understood as art work which draws upon important themes beyond the individual self, such as the transpersonal consciousness. This makes transpersonal art criticism <b>germane</b> to mystical approaches to creativity. Transpersonal art criticism, as Boucovolas notes, can be considered that which claims conventional art criticism has been too committed to stressing rational dimensions of art and has subsequently said little on art's spiritual dimensions, or as that which holds art work has a meaning beyond the individual person. Certain aspects of the psychology of Carl Jung, as well as movements such as music therapy and art therapy, may also relate to the field. Boucovolas' paper cites Breccia (1971) as an early example of transpersonal art, and claims that at the time his article appeared, integral theorist Ken Wilber had made recent contributions to the field. More recently, the Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, in 2005, Volume 37, launched a special edition devoted to the media, which contained articles on film criticism that can be related to this field.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis covers two fields of investigation: 1) Development of Peptidic Inhibitors of the IgE-FcєRI Protein-Protein Interaction in Allergy. When Immunoglobulin E (IgE) binds to its high affinity receptor protein FcєRI {{on the surface of}} mast cells or blood basophiles, it can cause an immediate allergic reaction by triggering the release of toxic inflammatory agents. Inhibition of the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between IgE and FcєRI is known to prevent the release of inflammatory agents; thereby effectively targeting allergic disorders. In this thesis, the development of a retro-αFcєRI C-region mimic peptidic inhibitor (named BM 1149 -Am; IC 50 = 77 ± 11 μM av.) from the study of literature peptidic inhibitors is described. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of BM 1149 -Am using alanine-scan and truncation techniques identified the key structural epitope along the sequence to be Tyr-Tyr-Ile-Val. One of the alanine-scan analogues, [Y 8 A] BM 1149 -Am showed a 10 -fold improved IC 50 value in ELISA assay compared to that of BM 1149 -Am. 2) Towards Aryl Germane-Based Synthetic Mutagenesis of Peptides Synthetic mutagenesis of aromatic amino acids (AAAs), in particular phenylalanine (Phe) and tyrosine (Tyr), to give biaryl derivatives are of great interest. Such biaryl units are important structural elements in protein-protein interactions (PPI). Biaryls are generally prepared by cross-coupling between aryl metals and aryl halides.
