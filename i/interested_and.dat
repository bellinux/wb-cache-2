5|$|In fact, Puccini was {{at first}} less than {{enthusiastic}} about the idea for this comic opera– Florence as a setting did not appeal to him, and he feared the public would have {{little interest in the}} subject. However, he soon became <b>interested,</b> <b>and</b> did some work on the piece even while composing Suor Angelica. The religious-themed opera was completed in September 1917, and Puccini turned his full attention to Gianni Schicchi, although the war news and the 1918 influenza pandemic, in which Puccini lost a sister, distracted him from his work. The first draft was completed on 20 April 1918, and Puccini continued to refine and orchestrate it through the summer of 1918.|$|E
5|$|No {{immediate}} action {{had been taken}} after the 1880 act authorizing coins, but King Kalākaua was <b>interested</b> <b>and</b> government officials saw {{a way to get}} out of a financial bind by getting coins issued in exchange for government bonds. Businessman Claus Spreckels was willing to make the arrangements with the United States in exchange for profits from the coin production, and contracted with the US Mint to have $1,000,000 struck. Originally, a 12 cent piece was planned and a few specimens were struck, but it was scrapped in an effort to have uniformity between US and Hawaiian coins, and a dime was substituted. The coins were struck at San Francisco in 1883 and 1884, though all bear the earlier date.|$|E

Inwardly, he underwent an agonising struggle and became relentlessly self-critical, harshly judging his spirituality, use of time, vanity, self-control and relationships with others.|$|E

5|$|British {{producer}} Elizabeth Karlsen of Number 9 Films {{came across}} Nagy's script circa 2004, {{during which she}} co-produced Nagy's film Mrs. Harris with Christine Vachon of New York-based Killer Films. Berwin's rights to The Price of Salt expired in 2010, and Karlsen thereafter acquired the script. Berwin remained an executive producer on the film. Karlsen managed to convince Highsmith's estate to sign over the rights to her, closing down the deal with Tessa Ross in late 2011. She then persuaded a disillusioned and reluctant Nagy to come back on board. The producers hired a U.K. director who then dropped out because of scheduling conflicts. They later recruited Irish director John Crowley, who was announced in May 2012 along with the film's lead cast, Cate Blanchett and Mia Wasikowska, and involved producers, Karlsen and Stephen Woolley of Number 9 Films and Tessa Ross of Film4, who received executive producer credit. Carol was scheduled to commence photography in early 2013, until Crowley withdrew due to a scheduling conflict. Karlsen called Christine Vachon to discuss losing another director and Vachon told her that Haynes' new film {{was not going to}} happen because its star had backed out of it. They then decided to approach Haynes. Vachon, Haynes' frequent collaborator, asked him if he would be <b>interested</b> <b>and</b> he received a copy of the screenplay. Two days later he committed to direct and Vachon joined the film as a producer. Haynes was announced {{as the director of the}} film in May 2013. Two days later, The Weinstein Company acquired U.S. distribution rights at the Cannes Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|The {{congested}} {{streets and}} {{the distance to the}} City from the stations to the north and west prompted many attempts to get parliamentary approval to build new railway lines into the City. None were successful, and the 1846 Royal Commission investigation into Metropolitan Railway Termini banned construction of new lines or stations in the built-up central area. The concept of an underground railway linking the City with the mainline termini was first proposed in the 1830s. Charles Pearson, Solicitor to the City, was a leading promoter of several schemes and in 1846 proposed a central railway station to be used by multiple railway companies. The scheme was rejected by the 1846 commission, but Pearson returned to the idea in 1852 when he helped set up the City Terminus Company to build a railway from Farringdon to King's Cross. Although the plan was supported by the City, the railway companies were not <b>interested</b> <b>and</b> the company struggled to proceed.|$|E

Advisors: Paul van den Broek and Sashank Varma. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiii, 167 pages, appendices A-E. A positive association between <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> learning from texts {{has been well}} noted in the literature. However, {{the cause of the}} positive association between <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> learning from text is uncertain. The primary purpose of this dissertation was to examine a potential cause, inference generation, of the positive association between <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> learning from texts. Sixty undergraduate students participated in Experiment 1 by reading two scientific texts and writing recalls and answers to comprehension questions. Topic <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> text-based <b>interest</b> were measured using self-reports. The results indicated that topic <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> text-based <b>interest</b> were indeed positively associated with learning from texts. In Experiment 2, sixty-nine undergraduate students participated by completing the same measures as the participants in Experiment 1, with the inclusion of the think-aloud task while reading. The results from Experiment 2 indicated that topic <b>and</b> text-based <b>interest</b> were both found to be positively associated with inference generation. Subsequent analyses indicated that inference generation explained (as a mediator) the positive association between both topic <b>and</b> text-based <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> accurate answers to comprehension questions. In contrast, inference generation was statistically independent from the positive association between topic <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> recall. Inference generation affected the strength of (as a moderator) the positive association between text-based <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> recall. The findings from both experiments are discussed in the context of <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> text comprehension theories, specifically in regards to standards of coherence. The secondary purpose of this dissertation was to determine the usefulness of Wii Fit boards as a cost-effective means of incorporating gross body movements as an indirect measure of interest. Gross body movement data from forty-two of the participants in Experiment 1 was measured while the participants read the experimental texts. The findings indicated that <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> learning from text were negatively associated with both leaning back and shifting in one's seat. These findings are discussed in the context of embodied theories of cognition...|$|R
