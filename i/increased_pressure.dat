5|$|Bacterial {{contamination}} {{alone in}} absence of obstruction does not usually result in cholangitis. However <b>increased</b> <b>pressure</b> within the biliary system (above 20 cmH2O) resulting from obstruction in the bile duct widens {{spaces between the}} cells lining the duct, bringing bacterially contaminated bile {{in contact with the}} blood stream. It also adversely affects the function of Kupffer cells, which are specialized macrophage cells that assist in preventing bacteria from entering the biliary system. Finally, increased biliary pressure decreases production of IgA immunoglobulins in the bile. This results in bacteremia (bacteria in the blood stream) and gives rise to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) comprising fever (often with rigors), tachycardia, increased respiratory rate and increased white blood cell count; SIRS in the presence of suspected or confirmed infection is called sepsis. Biliary obstruction itself disadvantages the immune system and impairs its capability to fight infection, by impairing the function of certain immune system cells (neutrophil granulocytes) and modifying the levels of immune hormones (cytokines).|$|E

Oxford Castle was a powerful fortress and, rather than storming it, Stephen decided to settle down for a long siege.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{examined}} the effect of <b>increasing</b> <b>pressure</b> on biogenic silica dissolution and on prokaryotic assemblages associated with diatom detritus. Experiments were carried out in hyperbaric bottles subjected to a gradual <b>increase</b> in <b>pressure</b> and compared to incubations at atmospheric pressure. To examine only pressure effects and to simulate detritus degradation in the Mediterranean Sea, the incubation temperature was kept constant (13 °C), while <b>pressure</b> was <b>increased</b> by 1. 5 MPa d- 1, simulating a fall of particles at a sinking rate of 150 m d- 1 over 8 d. Aminopeptidase activity was significantly lower (nearly 5 -fold) under <b>increasing</b> <b>pressure</b> than under atmospheric pressure conditions. Lower aminopeptidase activity under <b>increasing</b> <b>pressure</b> affected biogenic silica dissolution, {{at least at the}} beginning of the incubation, corresponding to a simulated depth of the first 800 m of the water column.

In contrast, the taxonomic composition of prokaryotic communities was not affected by <b>increasing</b> <b>pressure,</b> but the input of fresh diatom detritus led to an increase in the relative abundance of the Cytophago-Flavobacter cluster and γ-Proteobacteria.

5|$|In {{the first}} months of 1941, British and Belgian colonial forces {{attacked}} Italian East Africa from the colony of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. By the end of March, they had seized the town of Gambela and begun containing retreating Italian forces, which were massing on a plateau in the mountain town of Saïo (presently Dembidolo) under the command of General Carlo De Simone and later General Pietro Gazzera. The British forces withdrew the following month and the Belgians advanced down the road to Saïo. The Italians repelled them and they were forced to hold their positions along a nearby brook. Almost no fighting took place in May as heavy rain bogged down the Belgians and turned their supply line from Sudan into mud, creating a food shortage. In early June, reinforcements arrived via river and the Belgians besieged the Italian supply depot at Mogi.
