40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} assess the capabilities and limitations of the Private Eye, a miniature, <b>head-mounted</b> <b>monitor.</b> The first experiment compared the Private Eye with a cathode ray tube (CRT) and hard copy in both a constrained and unconstrained work envelope. The task was a simulated maintenance and assembly task that required frequent reference to the displayed information. A main effect of presentation media indicated faster placement times using the CRT as compared with hard copy. There {{were no significant differences}} between the Private Eye and either the CRT or hard copy for identification, placement, or total task times. The goal of the second experiment was to determine the effects of various local visual parameters on the ability of the user to accurately perceive the information of the Private Eye. The task was an interactive video game. No significant performance differences were found under either bright or dark ambient illumination environments nor with either visually simple or complex task backgrounds. Glare reflected off of the bezel surrounding the monitor did degrade performance. It was concluded that this head-mounted, miniature monitor could serve a useful role for in situ operations, especially in microgravity environments...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} virtual reality, {{although}} evolving due to technological advances, {{has always been}} fundamentally defined as a revolutionary way for humans to interact with computers. The revolution comes from the concept of immersion, which {{is the essence of}} virtual reality. Users are no longer passive observers of information, but active participants that have leaped through the computer screen and are now part of the information. This has tremendous implications on how users interact with computer information in the virtual world.;Perhaps {{the most common form of}} interaction in a virtual environment is locomotion. The term locomotion is used to indicate a user 2 ̆ 7 s control of movement through the virtual environment. There are many ways for a user to change his viewpoint in the virtual world. Because virtual reality is a relatively young field, no standard interfaces exist for interaction, particularly locomotion, in a virtual world. There have been few attempts to formally classify the ways in which virtual locomotion can occur. These classification schemes do not take into account the various interaction devices such as joysticks and vehicle mock-ups that are used to perform the locomotion. Nor do they account for the differences in display devices, such as <b>head-mounted</b> displays, <b>monitors,</b> or projected walls.;This work creates a new classification system for virtual locomotion methods. The classification provides guidelines for designers of new VR applications, on what types of locomotion are best suited to the requirements of new applications. Unlike previous taxonomies, this work incorporates display devices, interaction devices, and travel tasks, along with identifying two major components of travel: translation and rotation. The classification also identifies important sub-components of these two.;In addition, we have experimentally validated the importance of display device and rotation method in this new classification system. This was accomplished through a large-scale user experiment. Users performed an architectural walkthrough of a virtual building. Both objective and subjective measures indicate that choice of display device is extremely important to the task of locomotion, and that for each display device, the choice of rotation method is also important...|$|R
40|$|The {{computer}} generated virtual environments {{made possible by}} virtual reality (VR) may be moved through and manipulated by users in real time [1], but most display methods, including computer <b>monitors,</b> <b>head-mounted</b> displays, or projection screens, have an important limitation—they do not allow users to move around the virtual environment in a natural way. Efforts to remove this limitation include the development in the U. S. of a device similar to a stationary unicycle [3], which attempts to simulate the walking motion of a person sitting upon it. But this less than- ideal solution introduces its own restrictions on freedom of movement. By contrast,freedom of movement is not restricted with the fully immersive spherical projection system known as the Cybersphere, developed through joint research by VR Systems and the University of Warwick, both in the U. K. Users who enter this spherical system—which represents {{a new approach to}} VR visualization—can walk, run,jump, or crawl in any direction, {{while at the same time}} being able to observe an all-encompassing virtual environment. In this article we describe where the Cybersphere fits in the world of virtual reality interfaces, and discuss ways it can be applied to a cross-sectional audience, ranging from simple component visualization to highly complex military simulations...|$|R
40|$|In a {{study of}} native {{listeners}} 2 ̆ 7 implicit knowledge of the social distribution of a phonological variable {{we found that the}} perceived distribution does not completely match the findings of production surveys of the same variable in the same community. This presents an interesting challenge to models of linguistic variation based exclusively on production data, and questions how the distribution of sociolinguistic variables is best defined. The linguistic phenomenon we are investigating is the 2 ̆ 7 unmerger 2 ̆ 7 of pre-nasal /i/ and /e/ among Anglo Houstonians. This long-standing feature of Southern American English is increasingly losing ground in large metropolitan centers of the South (e. g. Tillery and Bailey 2004). We conducted a speech perception experiment to measure the degree to which Houstonians expect Anglo speakers of three different age groups to participate in the merger. The experiment was conducted using a <b>head-mounted</b> eye-tracker, which <b>monitored</b> the participants 2 ̆ 7 eye movements as they selected on a computer screen the lexical items which they heard (Tanenhaus et al. 2000). Of particular interest were participants 2 ̆ 7 eye fixations on /eN/ and /iN/ competitors, i. e. words which are temporarily ambiguous with the target word in a merged production system. We interpret a greater amount of looks to the competitor as an indicator of the listener 2 ̆ 7 s readiness to assume that the speaker may have a merged system. The results show that, as predicted, listeners are more likely to assume a merged system when listening to an 2 ̆ 2 old 2 ̆ 2 speaker than when listening to a 2 ̆ 2 middle-aged 2 ̆ 2 speaker. However, we find {{no significant difference between the}} perception of a 2 ̆ 2 middle-aged 2 ̆ 2 and a 2 ̆ 2 young 2 ̆ 2 speaker. These results generally corroborate our recent production surveys in Houston (Gentry 2006; Pantos 2006), which show the merger to be positively correlated with age. However, there is a discrepancy between our participants’ perception and the actual production of Houstonians in the 2 ̆ 2 middle-aged 2 ̆ 2 group. Although, in production terms, native Houstonians in this group pattern with 2 ̆ 2 old 2 ̆ 2 speakers in participating in the merger, listeners expect a 2 ̆ 2 middle-aged 2 ̆ 2 speaker to pattern with a 2 ̆ 2 young 2 ̆ 2 speaker in being less merged. We suggest that this mismatch is due to recent demographic changes in Houston, with large numbers of non-Southern Anglo speakers moving into the Houston metropolitan area in the course of the Sunbelt migration (Thomas 1997; Klineberg 2006). Native listeners who are exposed to this linguistically mixed population apparently associate merged vowels specifically only with the oldest speakers, even though some younger speakers are also merged. Our study adds to previous research on the perception of vowel merger, including near-merger (Di Paolo and Faber 1990, Labov et al. 1991, inter alia) by providing additional evidence for the role of perceived speaker dialect as a potentially disambiguating factor in speech perception (Hay et al. 2006). Our findings have broad implications for the study of language variation as they challenge sociolinguists to consider whether the variation we seek to describe resides in the “objective” production of speakers native to a community, or rather in the “subjective” experience of its native listeners...|$|R
