500|$|In 2012, John Tobias said: [...] "If {{you look}} at any other pop culture phenomenon—like if {{you look at}} the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, for instance—it became popular at the time right around when Mortal Kombat became popular, and it had its highs and lows, and here they are once again talking about a major motion picture. That’s because of its place in pop culture. It’s always there for someone to pick up, polish off, blow the <b>dust</b> <b>off</b> of it, and re-release it. And Mortal Kombat will always be that way. It’ll be around 50 years from now." ...|$|E
500|$|Pocket Gamers Tracy Erickson {{said that}} the game [...] "remains as {{entertaining}} as it did 15 years ago, galvanising the adventure gaming resurgence on iPhone." [...] Erickson felt that the touch controls are [...] "only functional and not fantastic," [...] but that [...] "measures {{have been taken to}} address [...] to a respectable degree," [...] and that the [...] "minimally enhanced presentation raises alarm." [...] However, he concluded that even though [...] "More could have been done to brush the <b>dust</b> <b>off</b> this ageing title," [...] "it's still a standout game." [...] He gave it a [...] "Silver Award".|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall praised Krasinski's acting, {{noting that}} he {{got the chance to}} [...] "nail a great {{dramatic}} moment". He also felt that Dunder Mifflin's crisis was an interesting development for the show, and put a new spin on the recurring theme of fiscal issues. Finally, he praised the Andy and Erin romancing, noting that it [...] "allows the writers to push a similar scenario [...] in a more overtly comic direction, while still getting some pathos out of it." [...] Gage Henry of Paste felt that the entry was a [...] "great way to <b>dust</b> <b>off</b> last week’s" [...] episode. He was pleased that it show-cased Michael as the [...] "all-knowing father figure whose mysterious ways pan out in the end." ...|$|E

500|$|Cooper {{concluded}} the year back at Goldwyn with Howard Hawks {{to make the}} romantic comedy Ball of Fire with Barbara Stanwyck. In the film, Cooper plays a shy linguistics professor who leads a team of seven scholars who are writing an encyclopedia. While researching slang, he meets Stanwyck's flirtatious burlesque stripper Sugarpuss O'Shea who blows the <b>dust</b> <b>off</b> their staid life of books. The screenplay by Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder provided Cooper the opportunity to exercise {{the full range of}} his light comedy skills. In his review for the New York Herald Tribune, Howard Barnes wrote that Cooper handled the role with [...] "great skill and comic emphasis" [...] and that his performance was [...] "utterly delightful". Though small in scale, Ball of Fire was one of the top-grossing films of the year—Cooper's fourth consecutive picture to make the top twenty.|$|E
500|$|Early on, {{the team}} decided {{that rather than}} rely on old Halo themes, ODST would feature all-new music. [...] "It was a bit intimidating at first," [...] Salvatori recalled, [...] "because in {{previous}} Halo games if new ideas weren't coming, I could always <b>dust</b> <b>off</b> an old one {{and give it a}} new spin. I was afraid that we might hit some writer's block along the way, but that didn't happen at all. Instead, we had the freedom to explore some new musical territory, and the ideas flowed pretty quickly." [...] With the exception of the main player character, O'Donnell and Salvatori did not compose themes to represent characters. While the game's setting in Africa inspired some percussion pieces, the team was interested in a sparser atmosphere, which Salvatori described as [...] "a bit darker and less epic".|$|E
500|$|After the Abbot's death, {{the scene}} flashes to Joshua and the Quo Peregrinatur crew {{launching}} as the nuclear explosions begin. [...] Joshua, the last crew member {{to board the}} starship, knocks the dirt from his sandals (a reference to Matthew 10:14, [...] "If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the <b>dust</b> <b>off</b> your feet"), murmuring [...] "Sic transit mundus" [...] ("Thus passes the world," [...] a play on the phase sic transit gloria mundi, [...] "thus passes {{the glory of the}} world"). [...] As a coda, there is a final vignette depicting the ecological aspects of the war: seabirds and fish succumb to the poisonous fallout, and a shark evades death only through moving to particularly deep water, where, it is noted, the shark was [...] "very hungry that season." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{idea of a}} {{new album}} came back in 2010, as {{frontman}} Dave Grohl was touring Australia with Them Crooked Vultures. Grohl decided that [...] "we should make a documentary about the recording of this new album {{and make it a}} history of the band too. Rather than just record the album in the most expensive studio with the most state-of-the-art equipment, what if Butch and I were to get back together after 20 years and <b>dust</b> <b>off</b> the tape machines and put them in my garage?" [...] Grohl later elaborated that Vig was brought in so the record could be [...] "that one album that kinda defines the band: it might not be their best album, but it's the one people identify the band with the most, like Back In Black or the Metallica Black Album. It's like you take {{all of the things that}} people consider your band's signature characteristics and just amplify them and make one simple album with that. And that's sorta what I thought we could do with Butch, because Butch has a great way of trimming all the fat and making sense of it all." [...] Grohl also used the tour with the Vultures to turn song ideas into demos, which were then brought to drummer Taylor Hawkins to be further developed. The album would also mark the return of guitarist Pat Smear as a permanent member; Smear left the Foo Fighters after the release of The Colour and the Shape, but had been part of the touring band since 2006.|$|E
500|$|Given {{only the}} artwork and outline {{to work with}} during production, writer Yoshinori Kitase felt that one early scene of Kefka's {{approach}} of a castle was too [...] "boring to make completely normal" [...] and decided to ad-lib a scene where he requests that his accompanying soldiers <b>dust</b> <b>off</b> his boots {{in the middle of}} a desert. The scene set the tone for his personality from that point onwards, suggesting that there [...] "may be a screw or two missing from this character's head". He has been described as [...] "powerful" [...] and [...] "manipulative", though he is retiring on occasion when confronted by opposition and even called a coward for delegating his authority. He is also known for his sarcastic tone and one-liners. As Kefka's power grows, his nihilism and madness grow in tandem and as he attains godlike powers he thirsts for the destruction of all life, expresses his loathing of everything in existence by chanting the word [...] "hate" [...] to his enemies. He is also very sadistic, taking amusement at the very idea of people dying and screaming. This is especially evident when he poisons Doma, as well as his admission prior to confronting the Returners for the final time that he enjoys destroying things precisely because precious lives are lost in the process. In his Dissidia appearance, Kefka's insanity is further explored, suggesting that his actions stem from a desire to fill his heart with destruction when love failed to provide his life with meaning. Final Fantasy VI features a song called [...] "Kefka", which exemplifies the [...] "sadistic joy" [...] of the character. His laughter has been called the greatest video game laughter of all time.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2005, Tiffany {{released}} the album <b>Dust</b> <b>Off</b> and Dance. It {{was dedicated to}} her new husband, but recorded as a thank you to her fans (particularly her gay and European fanbase) for reminding her about the fun to be had with her career.

The singles from <b>Dust</b> <b>Off</b> And Dance, such as [...] "Ride It", [...] "Fly", [...] "Be With U Tonite", [...] "Na Na Na", and [...] "Artificial Girlfriend", all charted on listener-sponsored radio stations that also streamed online, such as WMPH and C895Worldwide.

2500|$|Midland Works emitted vast {{quantities}} of asbestos dust, primarily through its ventilation system, which covered the nearby streets and rooftops of surrounding houses.

2500|$|Women {{were known}} {{to take charge of}} castle or manor {{business}} while her husband was away in the Middle Ages and defend it if need be, but the stand of Lady Agnes {{is one of the best}} remembered instances.

On August 25, 2005, the Spirit Rover, with an excess of energy due to wind blowing <b>dust</b> <b>off</b> of its solar panels, took several short-exposure photographs {{of the night sky}} from the surface of Mars.

2500|$|... "Morrissey and co {{have once}} again delved into their Sixties treasure-trove, and {{produced}} a visceral power capable of blowing the <b>dust</b> <b>off</b> Eighties inertia. The majestic ease of Morrissey's melancholic vocals are tinted with vitriol, as they move through vistas of misery with plaintive spirals around the pulse of Johnny Marr's vibrato guitar. The string's muted strains conjure wistful signs that bridge the schism between crass sentimentality and callous detachment. Each repeated phrase intensifies the hypnotic waves, with results that outflank anything since 'This Charming Man'. Catharsis has rarely been tinged with so much regret, and shared with so much crystalline purity." [...] – Melody Maker, 2 February 1985 ...|$|E
50|$|After the Second World War on 11 November 1948 Avignon {{received}} a citation {{of the order}} of the division. This distinction involved the awarding of the Croix de Guerre with Silver Star.

2500|$|Raymond v. Raymond mirrors Usher's 2004 Confessions, as a self-confessional album, {{with several}} {{recordings}} from the album inferring to Usher's marriage. Jive Records urban music president and album executive producer Mark Pitts also conceived the album as {{a return to}} the themes of the latter album; [...] "based on what happened with Confessions", Pitts wanted to reproduce its success. Pitts told The New York Times that [...] "Usher had a rough couple years", elaborating: [...] "The scrutiny of everything going on, he was worrying too much about what people were thinking. We felt like we had to get his swagger back. <b>Dust</b> <b>off</b> the bed and get it popping and young again." [...] Pitts noted that it was important Raymond v. Raymond addressed the rumors that circulated around Usher's marriage. The latter reiterated that the album is not specifically about his marriage, and that it is [...] "about the tug-of-war between man and woman, and the honesty a man has to have." ...|$|E
