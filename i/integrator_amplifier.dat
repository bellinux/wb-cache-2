50|$|One {{method to}} {{increase}} the integrator capacity is by periodically adding or subtracting known quantities of charge during the run-up phase {{in order to keep}} the integrator's output within the range of the <b>integrator</b> <b>amplifier.</b> Then, the total amount of artificially-accumulated charge is the charge introduced by the unknown input voltage plus the sum of the known charges that were added or subtracted.|$|E
50|$|One {{method to}} improve the {{resolution}} of the converter is to artificially increase the range of the integrating amplifier during the run-up phase. As mentioned above, the purpose of the run-up phase is to add an unknown amount of charge to the integrator to be later measured during the run-down phase. Having the ability to add larger quantities of charge allows for more higher-resolution measurements. For example, assume that we are capable of measuring the charge on the integrator during the run-down phase to a granularity of 1 coulomb. If our <b>integrator</b> <b>amplifier</b> limits us to being able to add only up to 16 coulombs of charge to the integrator during the run-up phase, our total measurement will be limited to 4 bits (16 possible values). If we can increase the range of the integrator to allow us to add up to 32 coulombs, our measurement resolution is increased to 5 bits.|$|E
40|$|The {{generation}} of the maximum expiratory flow-volume (m. e. f. v.) curve forms {{the basis of a}} test extensively employed in almost all lung-function laboratories. The area under the m. e. f. v. curve (a. f. v.) has recently been shown to be a very sensitive index of lung-function impairment. A prerequisite for the routine employment of the a. f. v. measurement in conjunction with the m. e. f. v. curve is that the data should be immediately accessible. The planimetry of areas is both time-consuming and subject to human error. Alternatively, the use of digital equipment to measure a. f. v., while avoiding these disadvantages, could prove relatively expensive. The authors have developed an inexpensive analog device for the direct measurement of a. v. f. based on a mathematical derivation which states that by squaring the flow signal and integrating with respect to time the area under the m. e. f. v. curve is obtained. The circuit diagram of the measuring device is shown. It comprises, basically, a multiplier module which squares the input signal (flowrate) prior to integration. The <b>integrator</b> <b>amplifier</b> is balanced by means of an offset adjustment network, while the calibration amplifier is used to obtain a readout on the digital voltmeter (d. v. m.) display in units of square litres per second.

In the transmit mode, TX B+ {{is applied to the}} circuit to bias the diodes “on”. The shunt diode (CR 161) shorts out the receiver port, and the pi network, which oper-ates as a quarter wave transmission line, transforms the low impedance of the shunt diode to a high imped-ance at the input of the harmonic filter. In the receive mode, the diodes are both off, and hence, there exists a low attenuation path between the antenna and receiver ports. The harmonic filter consists of part of C 122, L 121, and C 123. This filter attenuates the harmonic of the module to a level better than- 55 dBc. To optimize the transmitter and receiver performance into the antenna, a network is used to match the antenna’s impedance to the harmonic filter. The net-work is made up of C 125 and L 122. The power control circuit consists of the networks associated with U 151, Q 151, Q 155, and U 111. U 111 is a directional coupler which detects the forward power of the power module U 101.

However, due to extremities in temperature, acquiring uncorrupted signals become a challenging task. Presented in this thesis is a design of a twin operational amplifier based low offset integrating system to eliminate any error in measurement due to temperature dependent DC offset. This integrator system comprises mainly three stages after the inductive sensor. The first stage consists of a dual integrator in which the output signal from the sensor was fed to one integrator and the input terminals of the other integrator were grounded. An instrumentation amplifier which has a very high common mode rejection ratio and large input impedance was implemented in the second stage to find the differential signal between the outputs of the two integrators. Any noise arising in the environment was eliminated in the next stage by a Digital Signal Processor based Finite Impulse Response Low-Pass Filter. The first two stages of the design were simulated by using Multisim Circuit Design Suite. The low-pass filtering stage was realized on a Texas Instruments TMS 320 C 6713 starter kit using Kaiser Windowing technique to achieve a sharp cut-off at 780 Hz.

40|$|Transactivation of the {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) {{is thought to be}} a process by which a variety of cellular inputs can be integrated into a single signaling pathway through either stimulated proteolysis (shedding) of membrane-anchored EGFR ligands or by modification of the activity of the EGFR. As a first step towards building a predictive model of the EGFR transactivation circuit, we quantitatively defined how signals from multiple agonists were integrated both upstream and downstream of the EGFR to regulate extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) activity in human mammary epithelial cells. By using a “non-binding” reporter of ligand shedding, we found that transactivation triggers a positive feedback loop from ERK back to the EGFR such that ligand shedding drives EGFR-stimulated ERK that in turn drives further ligand shedding. Importantly, activated Ras and ERK levels were nearly linear functions of ligand shedding and the effect of multiple, sub-saturating inputs was additive. Simulations showed that ERK-mediated feedback through ligand shedding resulted in a stable steady-state level of activated ERK, but also showed that the extracellular environment can modulate the level of feedback. Our results suggest that the transactivation circuit acts as a context-dependent <b>integrator</b> and <b>amplifier</b> of multiple extracellular signals and that signal integration can effectively occur at multiple points in the EGFR pathway.

Preliminary results demonstrate that the ectopic expression of the dominant active translational repressor protein 4 E-BP 1 effectively suppresses colony formation and tumorigenesis in mesothelioma cells, thus justifying the plausibility of targeting cap-dependent translation in treating this cancer. 4 EGI- 1 is a novel small molecule inhibitor which has been shown to efficiently disrupt cap-dependent translation by inhibiting the interaction between translation initiation factors eIF 4 E and eIF 4 G and enhancing 4 E-BP 1 association.

However, even in photonic systems, a careful optimization between the degree of de-multiplexing, the optical non-linearities and receiver front-end noise has to be performed to enable resolution and sampling rate gains to materialize.
