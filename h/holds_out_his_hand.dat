6000|$|RUTH {{stands as}} though turned to {{stone in the}} doorway staring at [...] COKESON, who, bending humbly before her, <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> as [...] one would to a lost dog.|$|E
60|$|ARTHUR (<b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> eagerly). If you please, Miss Phoebe.|$|R
60|$|She {{leaned back}} and the prince took her place, <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|R
60|$|Wally was <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> <b>His</b> {{face was}} stolid {{and his eyes}} avoided hers.|$|R
6000|$|At the blowing of the Shepherd's pipe, THE COW HORN {{stretches}} [...] forth {{his hand}} to her. The mandolin twangs out, and THE WINE [...] HORN <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> She stands unmoving.|$|E
6000|$|... [He {{goes up to}} MERCY, and <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> She {{does not}} take [...] it, and runs out knuckling her eyes. STRANGWAY turns on his [...] heel and goes into the house.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He stoops over {{to brush}} the dust off his clothes, when {{out of his}} pocket drops a fine, nine-inch burglar's steel jimmy. He picks it up and looks at me sharp, and then grins and <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
60|$|Tom looked up, in surprise, and saw John Westlock close beside him, <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{principal}} {{smiled and}} {{he came up to}} Agatha, <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> for the chalk.|$|R
60|$|<b>Holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to Lawrence, in a condescending manner, {{he thanked}} him for the service he had just rendered.|$|R
60|$|God {{bless you}} and yours. If I look like some weather-beaten pilot when we meet, don't be surprised. Any mahogany-faced {{stranger}} who <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to {{you will probably}} turn out, on inspection, to be the old original Dick.|$|E
6000|$|... [Smiling.] So you {{resolved}} {{to give the}} girls a treat by coming to Lady Kelsey's dance? How nice of you not to disappoint them! [He turns to LUCY and <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> They look into one another's eyes. She takes his hand.] I sent you a paper this evening.|$|E
6000|$|... "The man speaks up {{and says}} he has no assets or {{valuables}} of any sort. But Bassett takes his hand-satchel and opens it. Out comes some collars and socks and a half a page of a newspaper clipped out. Bill reads the clipping careful, and <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to the held-up party.|$|E
60|$|They {{had come}} to a pause at the corner, and the man they had rescued was <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm going," [...] said Mr. Polly suddenly, {{releasing}} {{himself from}} the Anglo-Japanese grip and <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> for <b>his</b> bicycle.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well!' said Tom, <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> {{for more}} {{when she had}} {{restored}} this epistle. 'You have heard all there was in it, except--' ...|$|R
60|$|I'm glad you've accepted. Whatever happens you'll {{have done}} a brave action in your life. [He <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to GEORGE, who takes it.] I think there's nothing more to be said. You {{must be ready to}} start in half an hour. Here's your revolver. Remember that one chamber's empty. You'd better put in another cartridge.|$|E
6000|$|... "I di'n't say I was, Sooz'n, but I cou'n't help it. Well, Massa Lawrence, who's {{too much}} of a man to remain orkerd long, goes up to Miss Manuela wid a leetle smile, an' <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> She shakes it quite gently-like, zif dey was on'y noo acquaintances jest interdooced. Ob course I di'n't hear rightly all dey said--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{now they}} have {{let me come back}} to my Jock, and I see visibly his improvement. He <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> and he smiles, and he speaks now and then, the dreadful oppression is gone, and all the {{dangerous}} symptoms are abating, and I cannot tell how happy and thankful we are. 'Send my love, and tell Sydney she has a blessed Monk,' he says, as he wakes, and sees me writing.|$|E
6000|$|... "How are you, Mr. Bosinney?" [...] he said, <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> [...] "You've been {{spending}} money pretty freely down here, I should say!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You know me, then, you man-of-the-woods," [...] said he, <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> in {{the white}} trader fashion which the other had taught him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Name of Felixstowe," [...] {{the young}} man observed, <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> with a winning smile. [...] "Glad to meet you, Mr. Samuel Pratt." ...|$|R
60|$|The Cardinal! Men {{follow my}} creed, and they gabble his. I {{do not think}} much of the Cardinal; Although he is a holy churchman, and I quite admit his dulness. Well, sir, from now We count you of our {{household}} [He <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> for GUIDO to kiss. GUIDO starts back in horror, but at a gesture from COUNT MORANZONE, kneels and kisses it.] We will see That you are furnished with such equipage As doth befit your honour and our state.|$|E
6000|$|BURKE--[Offended. Passionately.] Leave {{off your}} fooling! 'Tis that is after getting my {{back up at}} you. [Earnestly.] 'Tis no lie I'm telling you about the women. [Ruefully.] Though it's a great jackass I am to be mistaking you, even in anger, for the like of them cows on the {{waterfront}} is the only women I've met up with since I was growed to a man. [As ANNA shrinks away from him at this, he hurries on pleadingly.] I'm a hard, rough man and I'm not fit, I'm thinking, to be kissing the shoe-soles of a fine, dacent girl the like of yourself. 'Tis only the ignorance of your kind made me see you wrong. So you'll forgive me, {{for the love of}} God, and let us be friends from this out. [Passionately.] I'm thinking I'd rather be friends with you than have my wish for anything else in the world. [He <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to her shyly.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{doubt they}} might do so. I will see, at any rate, if I can obtain some money from the {{political}} agents. I have next to nothing in my military chest, and our forces are at a standstill for the want of it. But that {{does not seem to}} matter. While our troops are ill-fed, ragged, almost shoeless, and unpaid, every Spanish or Portuguese rascal who <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> can get it filled with gold. As to arms, they are in the first place wanted for the purpose of the Portuguese militia, who are likely to be a good deal more useful than these irregular bands; and in the second place, there are no means whatever of conveying even a hundred muskets, let alone the ten thousand that Romana is good enough to ask for. By the way, are you aware whether Sir John Moore intended the army to sail to England?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nora!" [...] he said huskily, <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> But {{she flung}} herself on his breast and clung to him, half laughing, half crying.|$|R
6000|$|... "And with me {{thou shalt}} live and die," [...] said Hereward, pulling up his horse, and frankly <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to <b>his</b> new friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, {{that had}} I, a capital sleep," [...] cried March heartily, <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> which the vision grasped unhesitatingly, and shook with manly vigour.|$|R
6000|$|... "The kid {{thought for}} a minute. 'I guess I made a mistake,' he says. 'I ought to have gone farther west. They find 'em wild {{out there in the}} canyons.' He <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to John Tom, the little rascal. 'Please excuse me, sir,' says he, 'for {{shooting}} at you. I hope it didn't hurt you. But you ought to be more careful. When a scout sees a Indian in his war-dress, his rifle must speak.' Little Bear give a big laugh with a whoop at the end of it, and swings the kid ten feet high and sets him on his shoulder, and the runaway fingers the fringe and the eagle feathers and is full of the joy the white man knows when he dangles his heels against an inferior race. It is plain that Little Bear and that kid are chums from that on. The little renegade has already smoked the pipe of peace with the savage; and you can see in his eye that he is figuring on a tomahawk and a pair of moccasins, children's size.|$|E
60|$|Thus Goodall's tempter deserts him. That youth, uncomplaining and uncaring, takes a spell at coughing, and, recovered, wanders desultorily on {{down the}} street, the name of which he neither knows nor recks. At a certain point he {{perceives}} swinging doors, and hears, filtering between them a noise of wind and string instruments. Two men enter from the street as he arrives, and he follows them in. There {{is a kind of}} ante-chamber, plentifully set with palms and cactuses and oleanders. At little marble-topped tables some people sit, while soft-shod attendants bring the beer. All is orderly, clean, melancholy, gay, of the German method of pleasure. At his right is the foot of a stairway. A man there <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> Goodall extends his, full of silver, the man selects therefrom a coin. Goodall goes upstairs and sees there two galleries extending along the sides of a concert hall which he now perceives to lie below and beyond the anteroom he first entered. These galleries are divided into boxes or stalls, which bestow with the aid of hanging lace curtains, a certain privacy upon their occupants.|$|E
60|$|Let us {{now imagine}} Wakefield bidding adieu to his wife. It is the dusk of an October evening. His {{equipment}} is a drab great-coat, a hat covered with an oilcloth, top-boots, an umbrella {{in one hand}} and a small portmanteau in the other. He has informed Mrs. Wakefield that he is to take the night coach into the country. She would fain inquire the length of his journey, its object, and the probable time of his return; but, indulgent to his harmless love of mystery, interrogates him only by a look. He tells her not to expect him positively by the return coach, nor to be alarmed should he tarry three or four days; but, at all events, to look for him at supper on Friday evening. Wakefield himself, be it considered, has no suspicion of what is before him. He <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> she gives her own, and meets his parting kiss in the matter-of-course way of a ten years' matrimony; and forth goes the middle-aged Mr. Wakefield, almost resolved to perplex his good lady by a whole week's absence. After the door has closed behind him, she perceives it thrust partly open, and a vision of her husband's face, through the aperture, smiling on her, and gone in a moment. For the time, this little incident is dismissed without a thought. But, long afterwards, when she has been more years a widow than a wife, that smile recurs, and flickers across all her reminiscences of Wakefield's visage. In her many musings, she surrounds the original smile with a multitude of fantasies, which make it strange and awful: as, for instance, if she imagines him in a coffin, that parting look is frozen on his pale features; or, if she dreams of him in heaven, still his blessed spirit wears a quiet and crafty smile. Yet, for its sake, when all others have given him up for dead, she sometimes doubts whether she is a widow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, you's not frighted?" [...] said Tumbler, <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> as {{he stood}} {{on the top of a}} block, {{encouraging}} his companion to advance.|$|R
6000|$|... "How are you?" [...] he said, <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> The young Indian took it {{and responded}} to the shake, but he shook his head.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, good-bye." [...] {{said the}} young man, rising up and <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> [...] "Keep {{your eye on}} Dimsdale and don't trust him." ...|$|R
