40|$|A strong, {{negative}} empirical correlation {{exists between}} arrest rates and reported crime rates. While this relationship {{has often been}} interpreted as support for the deterrence hypothesis, it is equally consistent with incapacitation effects, and/or a spurious correlation that would be induced by measurement error in reported crime rates. This paper attempts to <b>discriminate</b> between <b>deterrence,</b> incapacitation, and measurement error as explanations for the empirical relationship between arrest rates and crime. Using {{a modified version of}} the techniques of Griliches and Hausman (1986) for dealing with measurement error in panel data, this paper first demonstrates that the presence of measurement error does not appear to explain the observed relationship between arrest rates and crime rates. To differentiate between deterrence and incapacitation, the impact of changes in the arrest rate for one crime on the rate of other crimes is examined. In contrast to the effect of increased arrests for one crime on the commission of that crime, where deterrence and incapacitation are indistinguishable, it is demonstrated that these two forces act in opposite directions when looking across crimes. Incapacitation suggests that an increase in the arrest rate for one crime will reduce all crime rates; deterrence predicts that an increase in the arrest rate for one crime will lead to a rise in other crimes as criminals substitute away from the first crime. Empirically, deterrence appears to be the more important factor, particularly for property crimes. ...|$|R
40|$|Dichloromethane (DCM) extract {{of garlic}} (Allium sativum Linn.) bulbs was {{assessed}} for its repellent effect against the hard tick, Hyalomma rufipes (Acari: Ixodidae) using two tick behavioural bioassays; Type A and Type B repellency bioassays, under laboratory conditions. These bioassays exploit the questing behaviour of H. rufipes, a tick that in nature displays ambush strategy, seeking its host by climbing up on vegetation and attaching to a passing host. One hundred microlitres (100 µL) {{of the test}} solution containing DCM extract of garlic bulbs and DCM at concentrations of 0. 35 %, 0. 7 % or 1. 4 % w/v were evaluated. DCM only was used for control. Tick repellency increased significantly (R 2 = 0. 98) with increasing concentration (40. 03 % – 86. 96 %) yielding an EC 50 of 0. 45 % w/v in Type B repellency bioassay. At concentration of 1. 4 % w/v, the DCM extract of garlic bulbs produced high repellency index of 87 % (male ticks) and 87. 5 % (female ticks) in the Type A repellency bioassay. Only 4 % avoidance of male ticks or female ticks was recorded in the Type B repellency bioassay. In the corresponding controls, the mean numbers of non-repelled male or female ticks were 80 % and 41 males or 38 females of 50 ticks in the Type A and Type B repellency bioassays, respectively. The variations in the results {{could be attributed to}} the difference in tick repellent behaviours that were assessed by the two repellency bioassays; the Type A repellency bioassay assessed repellent effect of garlic extracts without <b>discriminating</b> between <b>deterrence</b> and avoidance whereas the Type B repellency bioassay only assessed avoidance response. Generally, DCM extract of garlic was repellent against H. rufipes, albeit weak tick repellency was obtained in the Type B repellency bioassay. Furthermore, this study established that the tick repellent activity of garlic extracts is predominantly by deterrence. </span...|$|R
