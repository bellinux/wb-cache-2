5|$|Bure {{was set to}} {{make his}} much-anticipated return to Vancouver to play the Canucks on November 5, 1999, but was {{kept out of the}} lineup due to a broken finger. A prior groin injury had also forced <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Panther's home game against the Canucks earlier in the season. During the season, he was named to the 2000 NHL All-Star Game in Toronto, where he {{recorded}} an assist and the eleventh hat trick {{in the history of the}} All-Star Game. Of Bure's three goals, two were assisted by his brother Valeri, who played on the same line with him, along with his Panthers linemate, Viktor Kozlov. Helping lead the World team to a 9–4 victory over North America, Bure was named the All-Star Game MVP.|$|E
25|$|In Limitless (2011), {{the protagonist}} Eddie Morra blinds one of Gennady's thugs in self-defence, then lunges {{at him with}} a grand piano, {{throwing}} <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> window.|$|E

60|$|He {{has even}} been to the club, where he waddles up the stairs so exactly like some {{respected}} member that he makes everybody most uncomfortable. I forget how I became possessor of him. I think I cut <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> old number <b>of</b> Punch. He costs {{me as much as}} an eight-roomed cottage in the country.|$|R
25|$|Clinton {{is portrayed}} in the film Beavis and Butt-Head Do America, where Butt-Head flirts with her; she {{responds}} by tossing <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> window. In , a Disney Channel Original Movie set in the year 2049, Clinton is the President of the United States.|$|E
25|$|The film's {{depiction}} of the Prince of Wales as an effeminate homosexual caused the film to be attacked by the Gay Alliance. The Gay Alliance was especially enraged by {{a scene in which}} King Edward I murders his son's male lover by throwing <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> castle window.|$|E
25|$|Weinstein {{has also}} {{cultivated}} {{a reputation for}} ruthlessness and fits of anger. According to Biskind, Weinstein once put a New York Observer reporter in a headlock while throwing <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> party. On another occasion, Weinstein excoriated director Julie Taymor and her husband during a disagreement over a test screening of her movie Frida.|$|E
60|$|In {{the evening}} I {{found time to}} look in upon my wounded friend, and found him propped up with {{cushions}} upon his couch, breathing with some pain, but as bright and merry as ever. Our prisoner, Major Ogilvy, who had conceived a warm affection for us, sat by his side and read aloud to <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> old book <b>of</b> plays.|$|R
60|$|Mike walked on, {{weighing}} this remark, {{and gradually}} {{made up his}} mind. It must be remembered {{that he was in}} a confused mental condition, and that the only thing he realised clearly was that Bob had pulled <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> uncommonly nasty hole. It seemed to him that it was necessary to repay Bob. He thought the thing over more fully during school, and his decision remained unaltered.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the 2009 NFL Draft, Gilbert gained Internet notoriety for a YouTube video {{featuring}} <b>him</b> jumping <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> swimming pool.|$|R
25|$|Yallop {{worked on}} his knee through 1984. Despite 0 and 2 in a Victoria-Queensland game and state one day games of 14, and 6 he was picked in the first test against the West Indies. In scoring 2 and 1, he looked very uncomfortable. He had a leg injury ad a knee {{operation}} which took <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lot of the season.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, he {{debuted in}} CanAm, {{initially}} for Autocoast in the TI-22, {{and then for}} Don Nichols' Shadow team. 1971 saw <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> full-time Formula One drive, though he had three drives in a third McLaren. 1972 saw him concentrate mainly on CanAm with Shadow, though he would take a one-off drive for BRM at the 1972 British Grand Prix, where he retired.|$|E
25|$|Monson faced Ivan Shtyrkov on 6th May, the {{promoter}} and him {{decided to}} do an exhibition match due to Monson having an injury that would have forced <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> legitimate MMA match. When the match started it quickly became clear that Shtyrkov was treating it as a real fight and shortly after dropping Monson with a straight right finished him with an armbar on his injured arm.|$|E
5|$|Nine years later, {{the four}} are {{once more the}} only beings on the ship. Rimmer is again a hologram, Holly is offline, and Lister is {{mourning}} Kochanski, lost to <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> airlock some time previously. A chance {{to get back to}} Earth through a dimension warp presents itself; although it is not quite what it appears to be, it gives Lister new hope when he learns that Kochanski is still alive after all.|$|R

5000|$|Michel Rolland's first clients {{included}} the Bordeaux Châteaux Troplong Mondot, Angélus, and Beau-Séjour Bécot. An early setback was {{the loss of}} two Saint-Émilion first growths, Château Canon and Château La Gaffelière, due to conflict in style with the owners and Rolland. According to Rolland, the loss [...] "calmed him down" [...] and brought <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> awkward stage in his early career. Twenty years later, the two chateaux returned {{to be part of}} the more than 100 wineries who employ Michel Rolland as their consultant.|$|R
25|$|After {{three seasons}} of success, Bracken {{struggled}} for New South Wales {{in both the}} 2003–04 and 2004–05 seasons taking 3 wickets at 76.33 and 7 wickets at 44.71 respectively. International commitments left Bracken {{out of the side}} for a large majority of the 2005–06 One Day season, however he performed well in his limited appearances, claiming 5 wickets at 21.60. Once again, Bracken's international duties kept <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large majority of the 2006–07 and 2007–08 seasons and he took 3 wickets at 54.33 and 5 wickets at 37.80 respectively.|$|E
25|$|Tattersall had {{an unusual}} style, quite {{different}} from the orthodox Jim Laker, who kept <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Test place for most of his career. Tattersall held his index finger around the seam of the ball and this allowed him to bowl a carefully disguised away-swinger to supplement his sharp off-break. He was rather faster than Laker, and this served to increase his penetration on the many wet wickets of his home county. Of small account as a batsman, he did nonetheless help Reg Simpson in a tenth wicket stand of 74 which helped to give England its first victory over Australia since their record win at The Oval in 1938.|$|E
25|$|The {{other basic}} {{defensive}} play {{is called the}} bump or ride-off. It's similar to a body check in hockey. In a ride-off, a player rides his pony alongside an opponent's mount {{in order to move}} an opponent away from the ball or to take <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> play. It must be executed properly so that it does not endanger the horses or the players. The angle of contact must be safe and can not knock the horses off balance, or harm the horses in any way. Two players following the line of the ball and riding one another off have the right of way over a single man coming from any direction.|$|E
60|$|He {{made this}} a briefer story, telling of his coming to Utah, his various occupations till {{he became a}} rider, and then how the Mormons had {{practically}} driven <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Cottonwoods, <b>an</b> outcast.|$|R

6000|$|Captain Blood {{regarded}} <b>him</b> steadily <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> face which, if impassive, had paled {{under its}} deep tan. About the prisoner, clamant, infuriated, ferocious, the rebels-convict surged, almost literally [...] "athirst for his blood." ...|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} stay in the top flight, Middlesbrough needed relegation rivals Newcastle and Hull City to lose, while they needed a five-goal swing to Hull in goal difference. Stewart Downing's injury kept <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Premier League game {{for the first time since}} November 2006, also {{throwing}} doubt on a possible summer transfer, and Tuncay captained the side. Boro had to go for it, but instead they fell behind. Gary O'Neil temporarily brought his side level, but they again conceded and lost 2–1. With Newcastle and Hull both losing, the opportunity to escape was there for Middlesbrough, but they had failed to take it. Their twelfth consecutive away defeat extended the club record, and equalled a Premier League one, and saw their eleven-year run in the top flight ended, with the club needing to prepare for the next season in the Football League Championship.|$|E
25|$|As T-Bird and Skank {{stop at a}} {{convenience}} store {{to pick up some}} supplies, Eric arrives and kidnaps T-Bird. Skank follows the pair to the docks and witnesses Eric kill T-Bird by tying him to the driver's seat of his car and forcing him to drive it {{off the edge of the}} pier where it explodes and sinks into the harbour. Skank escapes and goes to Top Dollar, a top-level criminal who controls all the street gangs in the city. Top Dollar and his lover/half-sister Myca have become aware of Eric's actions through various reports from witnesses (including Gideon, whom Top Dollar killed afterward). Top Dollar holds a meeting with his associates where they discuss new plans for their Devil's Night criminal activities. Eric arrives looking for Skank. A gun fight ensures the deaths of nearly all present, and Eric kills Skank by throwing <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> window. Top Dollar, Myca, and Grange (Top Dollar's right-hand man) escape.|$|E
25|$|During the Whitewater {{investigation}} in the 1990s, Susan McDougal, held in contempt for refusing to testify before special prosecutor Kenneth Starr's grand jury, was perp-walked wearing leg irons and a waist chain as well as handcuffs, which she wore over an ensemble consisting of a jacket, white blouse, miniskirt, black stockings and high heels. Starr was criticized for what {{was seen as a}} gratuitous attempt to humiliate an uncooperative witness. He claimed his office {{had nothing to do with}} the level of restraint she wore, and the marshals' service said that was standard for all prisoners in transit. In 1995 Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, already in Oklahoma Highway Patrol custody for a firearms violation, was paraded before television cameras by the FBI nearly three hours before he was officially arrested for the bombing. His lawyers later asked to have eyewitness identifications of him excluded from evidence, on the grounds that they were all based on the widely televised perp walk and none of the witness had been asked to pick <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lineup.|$|E

50|$|In Brazil, Bond and Holly Goodhead, a NASA {{scientist}} moonlighting as a CIA agent, {{infiltrate the}} rocket launch facility <b>of</b> Hugo Drax, <b>a</b> billionaire industrialist who has {{started his own}} private space exploration program. They quickly learn that Drax, a twisted social darwinist, intends {{to wipe out the}} human race while creating his own new 'master race' from personally selected specimens, spared from the destruction of Earth via biological weapons on-board Drax's personal space station. Bond and Goodhead manage to get on board the station via shuttlecraft, and proceed to destroy it and kill Drax by blowing <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> airlock.|$|R

25|$|In {{the first}} {{race of the}} Chase at Chicago, Kenseth started 12th. He led one lap to receive a bonus point with a fifth-place finish. During the second race of the Chase at New Hampshire, race leader Kevin Harvick ran out of fuel with 3 laps to go which allowed Kenseth to take the lead. He {{would go on to}} win his fifth race of the year and {{advances}} to {{the second round of the}} Chase. In the next race at Dover, because of rain, Kenseth was given the pole position for being the points leader. Kenseth led twenty-five laps and finished seventh to retain the points lead. During the Hollywood Casino 400, he led the most laps, but with five laps to go he was unable to keep Joey Logano behind him. Logano purposely made contact with Kenseth, causing him to spin out, knocking <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> position in the Eliminator Round, that Logano was already qualified for. At Talladega Superspeedway, Kenseth started in the second row of the grid. However, on the final green-white-checkered finish Kenseth crashed and finished twenty-sixth, prompting his elimination in the Contender Round.|$|E
500|$|Outside of {{the main}} games in the Soulcalibur series, Astaroth also appears in a Dreamcast VMU mini-game called [...] "Cannon Dare", in which the player must shoot <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cannon by {{guessing}} the correct fuse, and later as a playable character in Namco's Pac-Man Fever. Astaroth also appears briefly in s Gauntlet storyline, a side story set after the events of Soulcalibur IV, tearing through a forest and challenging the protagonist and allies after they defeat a rampaging Maxi. In the prequel Soulcalibur Legends a similar prototype golem, Astaroth α, is discovered by game protagonist Siegfried. Upon defeat, he joins Siegfried's party as a playable character.|$|E
500|$|Given {{submitted}} a written transfer request in December 2000, {{after failing to}} regain {{his place in the}} first team from Steve Harper after a thigh injury had ruled <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> match against Leeds United. Manager Sir Bobby Robson stated at the time: [...] "A lot of clubs have a very good goalkeeper and one who stands by. I think we have two keepers — and Harper is proving that — who can play in the Premiership". The club rejected Given's request, which was then withdrawn by the goalkeeper, who later stated that his [...] "intention was simply to express [...] frustration at being left out of the team," [...] and that he [...] "never had any intention of actually leaving the club." [...] An injury to Harper led to Given being recalled to the first team, and he kept his place {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E

Midnighter gave Kev the chance to torture Froggett with a spiked baseball bat and afterwards they threw <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> airlock.
