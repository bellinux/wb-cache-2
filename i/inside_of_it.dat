5|$|The next ring {{is named}} the Le Verrier ring after Urbain Le Verrier, who {{predicted}} Neptune's position in 1846. With an orbital radius of about 53,200km, it is narrow, with a width of about 113km. Its normal optical depth is 0.0062±0.0015, which corresponds to an equivalent depth of 0.7±0.2km. The dust fraction in the Le Verrier ring ranges from 40% to 70%. The small moon Despina, which orbits just <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> at 52,526km, {{may play a}} role in the ring's confinement by acting as a shepherd.|$|E
5|$|While at {{the funeral}} for Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez) and Libby, a boat comes into view out at sea. Jack, Sayid, and Sawyer swim out to it and climb onto the boat. They hear music coming from inside it. Shots are fired from inside the boat through the boat hatch entrance. After {{breaking}} the hatch open, they find a drunken Desmond piloting the boat. The next day, after Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) prevents Locke from destroying the computer that controls the timer, Locke enlists Desmond's help in letting the timer run down to zero. Desmond hotwires the blast doors shut, locking Eko outside the computer room and Desmond and Locke <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Eko, distraught, seeks Charlie Pace's (Dominic Monaghan) help. The two attempt to use dynamite to blow the blast door open, but the blast doors are unscathed, while they are both injured.|$|E

In honor of the AFL's 50th anniversary, the Titans wore Oilers' uniforms for this game.

25|$|Four {{accounts}} of Berti's experiment exist, but a simple model of his experiment consisted of filling with water a long tube that had both ends plugged, then standing the tube in a basin already full of water. The bottom {{end of the}} tube was opened, and water that had been <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> poured out into the basin. However, {{only part of the}} water in the tube flowed out, and the level of the water inside the tube stayed at an exact level, which happened to be 10.3m, the same height Baliani and Galileo had observed that was limited by the siphon. What was most important about this experiment was that the lowering water had left a space above it in the tube which had no intermediate contact with air to fill it up. This seemed to suggest the possibility of a vacuum existing in the space above the water.|$|E

25|$|Hadrian had {{intended}} {{the construction of}} the new city as a gift to the Jews, but since he had constructed a giant statue of himself in front of the Temple of Jupiter and the Temple of Jupiter had a huge statue of Jupiter <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> there were on the Temple Mount now two enormous graven images, which Jews considered idolatrous. It was also customary in Roman rites to sacrifice a pig in land purification ceremonies. In addition to this, Hadrian issued a decree prohibiting the practice of circumcision. These three factors, the graven images, the sacrifice of pigs before the altar, and the prohibition of circumcision, are thought to have constituted for non-Hellenized Jews a new abomination of desolation, and thus Bar Kochba launched the Third Jewish Revolt. After the Third Jewish Revolt failed, all Jews were forbidden on pain of death from entering the city or the surrounding territory around the city.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, Godwin {{was living}} in Palm Springs, California, working as a {{self-employed}} tool salesman, a mechanic, and a construction worker, with no discernible criminal history. Godwin and his roommate, Frank Soto, Jr., planned to rob a drug dealer and pilot, Kim Robert LeValley, who was once a friend of theirs. Godwin and Soto lured LeValley back to their condominium where Soto held him, Godwin punched and kicked him, tried to strangle him, then ultimately stabbed LeValley 26 times with his butcher knife., however, during the trial, the prosecution said that Godwin used a serrated edge knife. A butcher's knife was not mentioned. After the murder, Godwin and Soto loaded the body into a truck and set off for the desert. Godwin tried {{to blow up the}} evidence by using homemade explosives strapped to the body. The explosion was intended to disguise the murder of LeValley. On August 3, 1980, some Eagle Mountain residents found a blown-up pickup truck with remains of a human body <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> abandoned in the desert.|$|E

500|$|For instance, while {{traveling}} in a moving vehicle at a [...] velocity, {{the laws of}} physics do not change {{as a result of its}} motion. If a person riding within the vehicle throws a ball straight up, that person will observe it rise vertically and fall vertically and not have to apply a force in the direction the vehicle is moving. Another person, observing the moving vehicle pass by, would observe the ball follow a curving parabolic path in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle. It is the inertia of the ball associated with its constant velocity in the direction of the vehicle's motion that ensures the ball continues to move forward even as it is thrown up and falls back down. From the perspective of the person in the car, the vehicle and everything <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is at rest: It is the outside world that is moving with a constant speed in the opposite direction of the vehicle. Since there is no experiment that can distinguish whether it is the vehicle that is at rest or the outside world that is at rest, the two situations are considered to be physically indistinguishable. Inertia therefore applies equally well to constant velocity motion as it does to rest.|$|E
