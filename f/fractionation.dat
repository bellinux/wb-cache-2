5|$|A 900,000‑year‑long {{period of}} {{quiescence}} followed after the felsic shield-building stage, {{during which time}} erosion ate away at the shield's gentle slopes. This quiescence {{was followed by a}} mafic capping stage between 2.2and 0.8million years ago, but renewed activity might have occurred in the last 340,000years. Alkali olivine basalts of the mafic capping stage were derived from the <b>fractionation</b> of a clinopyroxene, olivine and oxide assemblage. However, the associated hawaiite lavas may have derived from an alkali olivine basalt parent by the <b>fractionation</b> of a clinopyroxene-dominated assemblage at higher pressures. As volcanic activity waned during the mafic capping stage, lava flows became more viscous and decreased in volume. This suggests that parental magmas may have been derived by increasingly smaller degrees of partial melting with time. If volcanic activity of the Itcha Range is related to a hotspot, this temporal and spatial evolution would suggest a waning heat source.|$|E

40|$|The O 18 /O 16 {{ratios of}} coexisting {{minerals}} {{from a number}} of regionally metamorphosed rocks have been measured, using a bromine pentafluoride extraction-technique. Listed in order of their increasing tendency to concentrate O 18, the minerals analyzed are magnetite, ilmenite, chlorite, biotite, garnet, hornblende, kyanite, muscovite, feldspar, and quartz. The only anomalous sequence detected occurs in a xenolith of schist, in which quartz, muscovite, biotite, and ilmenite, but not garnet, have undergone isotopic exchange with surrounding trondjemite. With few exceptions, quartz-magnetite and quartz-ilmenite <b>fractionations</b> decrease with increasing metamorphic grade determined by mineral paragenesis and spatial distribution. This consistency does not apply to quartz-magnetite and quartz-ilmenite <b>fractionations</b> obtained from rocks in which petrographic evidence of retrogradation is present. Whereas measured isotopic <b>fractionations</b> among quartz, garnet, ilmenite, and magnetite are approximately related to metamorphic grade, <b>fractionations</b> between these minerals and biotite or muscovite show poor correlation with grade. Variations in muscovite-biotite <b>fractionations</b> are relatively small. These observations are interpreted to mean that muscovite and biotite are affected by retrograde re-equilibration {{to a greater extent than}} the anhydrous minerals analyzed. Measured quartz-ilmenite <b>fractionations</b> range from 12 permil in the biotite zone of central Vermont to 6. 5 permil in the sillimanite-orthoclase zone of southeastern Connecticut. Analyses of natural assemblages from the kyanite and sillimanite zones suggest that equilibrium quartz-ilmenite <b>fractionations</b> are approximately 8 percent smaller than corresponding quartz-magnetite <b>fractionations.</b> Employing the quartz-magnetite geothermometer calibrated by O'Neil and Clayton (1964), a temperature of 560 °C was obtained for kyanite-bearing schists from Addison County, Vermont. Extending the calibration to quartz-ilmenite <b>fractionations,</b> a temperature of 600 °C was obtained for kyanite-schists from Shoshone County, Idaho.

There have been many experimental studies of mineral-mineral and mineral-fluid <b>fractionations</b> but few involving silicate melt, particularly basic and ultrabasic melts relevant to study of mantle geochemistry and basaltic volcanism (Muehlenbachs & Kushiro, 1974). Consequently, <b>fractionations</b> involving such melts are generally estimated based on the systematics of differences in δ^(18) O between phenocrysts and co-existing glass or groundmass. Estimates of this type, although useful, are insufficient for interpreting the usually subtle oxygen isotope variations observed in many basaltic suites. Therefore, we have undertaken a series of experiments examining oxygen-isotope <b>fractionations</b> involving basic silicate melts.

40|$|Degassing of CO 2 from aqueous {{solutions}} occurs through bicarbonate dehydration (H + + HCO 3 - (aq) → H 2 CO 3 → CO 2 + H 2 O) and bicarbonate dehydroxylation (HCO 3 - (aq) → CO 2 + OH-). Kinetic isotope <b>fractionations</b> {{occur during}} this process, influencing the isotopic compositions {{not only of}} the degassed CO 2, but also of the carbonate minerals that precipitate from partially degassed solutions. We present here models of isotopic <b>fractionations</b> associated with HCO 3 - dehydration and dehydroxylation in aqueous solution, calculated using techniques from ab initio transition state theory, and tests of these models based on measurements of synthetic cryogenic carbonates and natural modern speleothems and laboratory synthesized speleothem-like carbonates, all of which grow from solutions that actively degas CO 2. Our model predicts the kinetic isotopic <b>fractionations</b> associated with bicarbonate dehydration and dehydroxylation for 13 C / 12 C, 18 O / 16 O ratios, as well as abundance anomalies (i. e., relative to a stochastic distribution) of 13 C- 18 O and 18 O- 17 O multiplysubstituted species; these <b>fractionations</b> are, respectively,- 29. 7 ‰,- 9. 0 ‰,- 0. 05 ‰, – 0. 0002 ‰ and – 0. 004 ‰ for HCO 3 - dehydration; and- 22. 5 ‰,- 16. 7 ‰, 0. 10 ‰ and – 0. 06 ‰ for HCO 3 - dehydroxylation, both at 25 °C.

40|$|We {{report the}} abundances and hydrogen-isotopic {{compositions}} (D/H ratios) of fatty acids extracted from hot-spring microbial mats in Yellowstone National Park. The terrestrial hydrothermal environment {{provides a useful}} system for studying D/H <b>fractionations</b> because the numerous microbial communities {{in and around the}} springs are visually distinct, separable, and less complex than those in many other aquatic environments. D/H <b>fractionations</b> between lipids and water ranged from − 374 ‰ to + 41 ‰ and showed systematic variations between different types of microbial communities. Lipids produced by chemoautotrophic hyperthermophilic bacteria, such as icosenoic acid (20 : 1), generally exhibited the largest and most variable <b>fractionations</b> from water (− 374 ‰ to − 165 ‰). This was in contrast to lipids characteristic of heterotrophs, such as branched, odd chain-length fatty acids, which had the smallest <b>fractionations</b> (− 163 ‰ to + 41 ‰). Mats dominated by photoautotrophs exhibited intermediate <b>fractionations</b> similar in magnitude to those expressed by higher plants. These data support the hypothesis that variations in lipid D/H are strongly influenced by central metabolic pathways. Shifts in the isotopic compositions of individual fatty acids across known ecological boundaries show that the isotopic signature of specific metabolisms can be recognized in modern environmental samples, and potentially recorded in ancient ones. Considering all sampled springs, the total range in D/H ratios is similar to that observed in marine sediments, suggesting that the trends observed here are not exclusive to the hydrothermal environment...|$|R

Not only has the MAM provided insight into the mechanistic basis underlying such physiological processes as intrinsic apoptosis and the propagation of calcium signaling, but it also favors a more refined view of the mitochondria. Though often seen as static, isolated 'powerhouses' hijacked for cellular metabolism through an ancient endosymbiotic event, the evolution of the MAM underscores the extent to which mitochondria have been integrated into overall cellular physiology, with intimate physical and functional coupling to the endomembrane system.|$|E
40|$|Large hydrogen-isotopic (D/H) <b>fractionations</b> between lipids {{and growth}} water have been {{observed}} in most organisms studied to date. These <b>fractionations</b> are generally attributed to isotope effects in the biosynthesis of lipids, and are frequently assumed to be approximately constant {{for the purpose of}} reconstructing climatic variables. Here, we report D/H <b>fractionations</b> between lipids and water in 4 cultured members of the phylum Proteobacteria, and show that they can vary by up to 500 ‰ in a single organism. The variation cannot be attributed to lipid biosynthesis as there is no significant change in these pathways between cultures, nor can it be attributed to changing substrate D/H ratios. More importantly, lipid/water D/H <b>fractionations</b> vary systematically with metabolism: chemoautotrophic growth (approximately − 200 to − 400 ‰), photoautotrophic growth (− 150 to − 250 ‰), heterotrophic growth on sugars (0 to − 150 ‰), and heterotrophic growth on TCA-cycle precursors and intermediates (− 50 to + 200 ‰) all yield different <b>fractionations.</b> We hypothesize that the D/H ratios of lipids are controlled largely by those of NADPH used for biosynthesis, rather than by isotope effects within the lipid biosynthetic pathway itself. Our results suggest that different central metabolic pathways yield NADPH—and indirectly lipids—with characteristic isotopic compositions. If so, lipid δD values could become an important biogeochemical tool for linking lipids to energy metabolism, and would yield information that is highly complementary to that provided by ^(13) C about pathways of carbon fixation...|$|R

There are 13 known isotopes of boron, the shortest-lived isotope is 7B which decays through proton emission and alpha decay. It has a half-life of 3.5×10−22 s. Isotopic <b>fractionation</b> of boron is controlled by the exchange reactions of the boron species B(OH)3 and −. Boron isotopes are also fractionated during mineral crystallization, during H2O phase changes in hydrothermal systems, and during hydrothermal alteration of rock. The latter effect results in preferential removal of the − ion onto clays. It results in solutions enriched in 11B(OH)3 and therefore may be responsible for the large 11B enrichment in seawater relative to both oceanic crust and continental crust; this difference may act as an isotopic signature.|$|E

Cathodoluminescence characteristics were investigated for the carbonatite minerals {{in order to determine the}} extent of alteration and to select unaltered samples. Oxygen isotope <b>fractionations</b> of minerals of unaltered samples yield crystallization temperatures between 450 and 960 degreesC (average 710 degreesC).

The CL pictures revealed that the zircon is broken and altered in the carbonatites and in associated syenites. Regarding geological field evidences of syenite-carbonatite relationship and the close agreement of published zircon U/Pb and whole rock and biotite K/Ar and Ar-Ar age data, the most probable process is early zircon crystallization from the syenite magma and late-stage reworking during magma evolution and carbonatite segregation.
