40|$|The role of {{angiogenesis}} and apoptosis-related {{proteins in}} <b>defining</b> response <b>to</b> chemotherapy <b>is</b> <b>poorly</b> understood. We examined the microvessel density (MVD) and {{the expression of}} p 53, bcl- 2, and bax proteins {{in a series of}} 28 locally advanced gastric adenocarcinomas, treated with paclitaxel and carboplatin A strong cytoplasmic reactivity in mon than 10 % of cancer cells was recorded in 25 % of cases for p 53 protein, and in 14 % and 64 % of cases for bcl- 2 and bax proteins, respectively. Microvessel density was assigned in three categories: low (60). Tumors of medium MVD showed a significantly higher response rate compared with those of high or low MVD (p = 0. 01 and 0. 001, respectively), and prognosis was significantly better in this group of patients with medium MVD tumors (p< 0. 02). Loss of bax protein expression was somewhat more frequent in tumors resistant to chemotherapy, but this difference was not of statistical significance. Nuclear p 53 reactivity was associated with higher MVD (p = 0. 02). The expression of p 53 and bcl- 2 did not influence the outcome of treatment. The present study suggests that although apoptosis-related proteins may have a role in <b>defining</b> response <b>to</b> taxanes, parameters related to tumors' vasculature, such as drug availability or angiogenic tissue regeneration, may be equally important...|$|R
