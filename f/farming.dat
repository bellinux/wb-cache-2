5|$|For {{most of its}} history, {{agriculture}} {{has been}} organic, without synthetic fertilisers or pesticides, and without GMOs. With the advent of chemical agriculture, Rudolf Steiner called for <b>farming</b> without synthetic pesticides, and his Agriculture Course of 1924 {{laid the foundation for}} biodynamic agriculture. Lord Northbourne developed these ideas and presented his manifesto of organic <b>farming</b> in 1940. This became a worldwide movement, and organic <b>farming</b> is now practiced in most countries.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, 76–77 {{per cent}} of output by value was {{livestock}} <b>farming</b> and, although this {{has fallen to}} about 64 per cent since 1990, arable <b>farming</b> remains {{a minority of the}} sector and two-thirds of agricultural land is rough pasture. One result is that chemicalisation and arable-based subsidies have had less impact on Scottish biodiversity than is the case in England where <b>farming</b> is overwhelmingly arable. The UK membership of the European Economic Community (later the European Union) in 1972 began a re-orientation for Scottish <b>farming.</b> A preference for Commonwealth markets was replaced by EU obligations. Agriculture became dominated by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EU, which made <b>farming</b> dependent on market support and direct grants to farmers. As a result, some sectors, particularly hill sheep <b>farming,</b> became viable only with subsidies. Eight-four per cent of Scottish land qualified for extra support as a Less Favoured Area (LFA), but 80 per cent of the payments were going to only 20 per cent of the farmers, mainly large commercial arable farms in the Lowlands. A series of reforms to the CAP from the 1990s attempted to control over-production, limit incentives for intensive <b>farming</b> and mitigate environmental damage. As part of an attempt to mitigate the depopulation and commercialisation of Scottish <b>farming,</b> the Crofting Act of 1976 made it easier for crofters to buy their farms, but most were insufficient to support a family, and many small farmers turned to fish <b>farming</b> and tourism to supplement their incomes. A dual farm structure has emerged with agriculture divided between large commercial farms and small pluralised and diversified holdings. Scotland has the highest average farm size in the European Union, almost ten times the average.|$|E
