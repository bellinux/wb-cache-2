Their children can also rent it for forty-nine years.|$|E

500|$|Gallagher {{has also}} been very vocal about knife crime. In 2008 he was quoted: [...] "The scumbags are taking over the streets. I don't know what David Cameron and Gordon Brown {{are going to do}} about it. <b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>goes</b> back to the Thatcher years. It sounds like a cliché but that's when the rot set in." [...] When the {{interviewer}} suggested it was for status he replied, [...] "In my day status was about trying to be somebody, not trying to kill somebody, so how's that all changed?" ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the band}} is of German origin, their music {{is based on the}} American style of death metal. Drummer Lille Gruber explained, [...] "Blues and rock music was {{developed}} in the U.S., that means <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>goes</b> back to this country. The roots are there and I think the best musicians will always be there." [...] When asked about the difference in terms of sound and direction between Psalms of the Moribund and Prelude to the Tragedy, Gruber stated, [...] "We got our own style on Psalms to the Moribund where Prelude to the Tragedy had very obvious hints of the bands we idolized. Psalms of the Moribund splits in two extremes, it went more chunky, brutal, thick and deep, {{but at the same time}} that math-approach and the technicality went up a lot!" ...|$|E

[...] The single nonetheless hit number one in Canada, number three on the US country charts, and number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100. When <b>It</b> <b>All</b> <b>Goes</b> South (2001) followed in 2001. [...] "If I never did another CD, this is the one I will always point to as the one that I was happy with the most," [...] said Owen {{at the time of its}} release. Despite this, the album's singles did not fare well in comparison to past successes, with only the title track becoming a top 15 hit, representing the band's last career peak.|$|E

500|$|Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph said, [...] "The {{brilliance}} of Barfi! is that it’s no story and all storytelling. It’s about a {{director at the}} top of his game orchestrating terrific talent into a bravura crescendo. Only someone who has showed death the door can open windows to life like this." [...] Filmfare gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and stated, [...] "Barfi! is that rare film that can make you smile and make you cry in the same scene. Its technical brilliance is only outdone by its emotional complexity and depth. Pritam's music adds a nice silent-era charm to this already fantastic story, making it an occasion when words simply aren’t enough." [...] Raja Sen of Rediff.com has given 3.5/5 stars and wrote, [...] "Barfi! is a well-crafted script with an intriguing back-and-forth narrative but <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>goes</b> south towards the end." ...|$|E

Cleverly's promoter, Frank Warren, won the purse bid. The WBO threatened Cleverly, who was hoping to pursue a unification fight against WBA champion Beibut Shumenov, if he didn't fight Krasniqi next. Cleverly said, [...] "If <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>goes</b> well with the Krasniqi fight, Shumenov is definitely in my sights and I would definitely like to fight the winner of Hopkins and Tavoris Cloud." [...] Although Cleverly wanted the fight to take place in Cardiff, he was open to the idea of fighting in Germany. Krasniqi, who lost two of his first three professional fight, had not lost in seven years, winning 38 consecutive fights.|$|E
2500|$|Greg McElhatton of Comic Book Resources (CBR) gave A-Force #1 four-and-a-half stars {{out of five}} writing, [...] "A-Force #1 is a triumph, {{taking a}} concept that could have simply been dashed off and then ignored and {{turning it into a}} book that I'd cheerfully read every month." [...] Tony Guerrero of Comic Vine gave it four out of five stars saying, [...] "This book was pretty much exactly what I wanted and hoped for. Too many times the female heroes in the Marvel Universe get overlooked. Marguerite Bennett and G. Willow Wilson have created a natural feeling world. It's easy to cry out that having just female heroes is a gimmick but it all simply works here." [...] Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave the issue an 8.4 out of 10 and said, [...] "While certain details {{regarding}} the nature of this team and their connection to the old marvel Universe remain unclear, A-Force #1 marks a worthy debut for Marvel's newest team book." [...] Eric Diaz of The Nerdist gave it three out of five burritos and wrote, [...] "Overall the issue was fine, and I'm curious to see where <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>goes,</b> but I'm far more eager to see what can be done with this grouping of [...] awesome female heroes once the wacky conceit of Secret Wars is over and they return to the Marvel Universe proper." [...] Diaz also noted that, [...] " [...] making a decidedly feminist statement by taking nearly all of their major female heroes and putting them together in their own Avengers title called A-Force." [...] Lan Pitts of Newsarama gave it an 8 out of 10 praising the artwork of Jorge Molina, Laura Martin and Matt Milla.|$|E

2500|$|Spears {{talked about}} her {{feelings}} toward the conservatorship her father contains and how she feels about her life, and quotes [...] "There's no excitement, there's no passion... I have really good days, and then I have bad days. Even {{when you go to}} jail, you know there's the time when you're gonna get out. But in this situation, it's never ending. It's just like Groundhog Day every day." [...] Spears added [...] "I think it's too in control, If I wasn't under the restraints I'm under, I'd feel so liberated. When I tell them the way I feel, it's like they hear but they're really not listening. I never wanted to become one of those prisoner people. I always wanted to feel free." [...] The singer also commented on her feelings towards fans and her music style. [...] "It's weird because your music is a reflection of what you're going through," [...] she says. [...] "It's such a part of me, the record, 'cause of what I've gone through." [...] In another clip, Spears talks about how she uses her work as a dancer and singer to deal with the stress of her life and how it helps her deal with her emotions. She said that for her, dancing is like therapy. [...] "If I have a lot of nervous energy, when I start dancing, <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>goes</b> away and I just feel emotion. It's like a rollercoaster," [...] she says. [...] "People think that when you go through something in life {{you have to go to}} therapy. For me, art is therapy, because it's like you're expressing yourself in such a spiritual way. [...] "Sometimes you don't need to use words to go through what you need to go through," [...] she continues. [...] "Sometimes it's an emotion you need to feel when you dance, that you need to touch. And the only thing that can touch it is when you move a certain way." ...|$|E
