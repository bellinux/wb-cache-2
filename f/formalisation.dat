5|$|Another {{change in}} the 1370s was the <b>formalisation</b> {{of the process of}} {{guarding}} and maintaining the walls. During the invasion scare of 1377, Edward instructed the mayor to review these processes; it appears that the four wards of the town were surveyed, and each property was assigned a piece of the wall to maintain, varying according {{to the size of the}} property. For these purposes, the walls were measured out in units called loupes, or embrasures. The four wards were also responsible for the security and policing of the town.|$|E
5|$|Each legion was {{normally}} {{partnered with}} an approximately {{equal number of}} allied (non-Roman) auxiliae troops. The addition of allied troops to the Roman army was a <b>formalisation</b> of the earlier arrangement of using light troops from the Socii and Latini, who had received Roman citizenship after the Social War. Auxiliary troops could be formed from either auxiliary light cavalry known as alae, auxiliary light infantry known as cohors auxiliae, or a flexible mixture of the two known as cohors equitata. Cavalry types included mounted archers (Latin: sagittarii) and heavy shock cavalry (Latin: cataphracti or clibanarii). Infantry could be armed with bows, slings, throwing spears, long swords, or thrusting spears. Auxiliary units were originally led by their own chiefs, and, in this period, their internal organisation was left to their commanders.|$|E

Our language is the lambda-calculus whose simplicity allows us to show actual theorem-prover code of the formal proofs. The <b>formalisations</b> are done in Nominal Isabelle, a de?nitional extention of the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL. The point of these <b>formalisations</b> is to be {{as close as possible}} to the ?pencil-and-paper? proofs for these properties, but of course be completely rigorous. We describe where Nominal Isabelle is of great help with such <b>formalisations</b> and where one has to invest additional effort in order to obtain formal proofs...|$|R

5|$|To {{meet the}} Dutch threat, Oerip {{intended}} to attack while the former colonists were still consolidating their forces, {{a plan that}} was quashed by the government's attempts at diplomacy. He preferred guerrilla tactics to formal military conflicts, once telling a subordinate that the best attack would be one with a hundred snipers hidden behind enemy lines. Oerip was strongly against the Renville Agreement, an ultimately unsuccessful treaty {{that led to the}} withdrawal of 35,000troops from western Java and the <b>formalisation</b> of the Van Mook Line between Dutch and Indonesian forces. He saw the agreement, ratified on 17January 1948, as a stalling tactic, giving the Dutch the chance to strengthen their forces. Meanwhile, Amir Sjarifuddin– by then also serving as prime minister– began culling the army, predominantly keeping leftist-leaning troops. Disgusted with what he perceived as the government's lack of trust in the military, Oerip tendered his resignation, although he continued to serve as an advisor to the Minister of Defence, Vice President Hatta.|$|E
5|$|During the 12th {{century the}} Norman kings {{attempted}} to formalise the feudal governance system initially created after the invasion. After the invasion {{the king had}} enjoyed a combination of income from his own demesne lands, the Anglo-Saxon geld tax and fines. Successive kings found that they needed additional revenues, especially {{in order to pay}} for mercenary forces. One way of doing this was to exploit the feudal system, and kings adopted the French feudal aid model, a levy of money imposed on feudal subordinates when necessary; another method was to exploit the scutage system, in which feudal military service could be transmuted to a cash payment to the king. Taxation was also an option, although the old geld tax was increasingly ineffective due to a growing number of exemptions. Instead, a succession of kings created alternative land taxes, such as the tallage and carucage taxes. These were increasingly unpopular and, along with the feudal charges, were condemned and constrained in the Magna Carta of 1215. As part of the <b>formalisation</b> of the royal finances, HenryI created the Chancellor of the Exchequer, a post which would lead to the maintenance of the Pipe rolls, a set of royal financial records of lasting significance to historians in tracking both royal finances and medieval prices.|$|E

25|$|Alfred Herbert Richardson (1874–1951) was an English policeman. He {{joined the}} Birmingham City Police in 1890. He {{achieved}} very rapid promotion within this force and in 1901 became Chief Constable of Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire. In 1903 he successfully {{applied for the}} Chief Constable's office at Halifax, West Riding of Yorkshire, where he remained {{until his retirement in}} 1944. During his time there he achieved many early improvements in policing at Halifax, some of which were later used nationwide. The most notable were the installing of coloured lights as traffic signals at road junctions, the <b>formalisation</b> of procedures for police identity parades, making 'keep left' mandatory for traffic and the installation of police telephones in the town, among others. In later years he was recognized as being a policeman who was ahead of his time. He came from a police family: his father, Frank Richardson (1851–1938), was the Chief Constable of Hereford from 1882 until 1920, and his elder brother, Ernest Frank Richardson (1871–1952), served as Chief Constable of Salisbury between 1903 and 1929. Thus three members of the Richardson family served as chief constables between 1902 and 1920. He also had three other brothers who served in other police forces.|$|E

Studies {{of the use}} of such notations in practice have shown that users often employ pragmatic aspects, such as layout, to capture important domain information.

500|$|Until 2002, {{the venue}} for European Council summits was the member state {{that held the}} {{rotating}} Presidency of the Council of the European Union. However, European leaders agreed during ratification of the Nice Treaty to forego this arrangement {{at such a time}} as the total membership of the European Union surpassed 18 member states. An advanced implementation of this agreement occurred in 2002, with certain states agreeing to waive their right to host meetings, favouring Brussels as the location. Following the growth of the EU to 25 member states, with the 2004 enlargement, all subsequent official summits of the European Council have been in Brussels, with the exception of punctuated ad hoc meetings, such as the 2017 informal European Council in Malta. [...] The logistical, environmental, financial and security arrangements of hosting large summits are usually cited as the primary factors in the decision by EU leaders to move towards a permanent seat for the European Council. Additionally, some scholars argue that the move, when coupled with the <b>formalisation</b> of the European Council in the Lisbon Treaty, represents an institutionalisation of an ad hoc EU organ that had its origins in Luxembourg compromise, with national leaders reasserting their dominance as the EU's [...] "supreme political authority".|$|E

Zermelo argued that his axioms should instead be studied in second-order logic, a setting in which Skolem's result does not apply. Zermelo published a second-order axiomatisation in 1930 and proved several categoricity results in that context.

2500|$|The {{collapse}} of statist ideologies in 1945–46 was paralleled by a <b>formalisation</b> {{of relations between}} the Shinto religion and the Japanese state, including disestablishment: termination of Shinto's status as a state religion. In August 1945, the term State Shinto (Kokka Shintō) was invented to refer to some aspects of statism. On 1 January 1946, Emperor Shōwa issued an imperial rescript, sometimes referred as the Ningen-sengen ("Humanity Declaration") in which he quoted the Five Charter Oath (Gokajō no Goseimon) of his grandfather, Emperor Meiji and renounced officially [...] "the false conception that the Emperor is a divinity". However, {{the wording of the}} Declaration – in the court language of the Imperial family, an archaic Japanese dialect known as Kyūteigo – and content of this statement {{have been the subject of}} much debate.

It instead used the unusual word akitsumikami, which was officially translated as [...] "divinity", but more literally meant [...] "manifestation/incarnation of a kami ("god/spirit")".
