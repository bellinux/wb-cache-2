Experiments have shown that a reduction in the number of neutrophils lessens the effects of acute lung injury, but treatment by inhibiting neutrophils is not clinically realistic, as it would leave the host vulnerable to infection. In the liver, damage by neutrophils can contribute to dysfunction and injury in response to the release of <b>endotoxins</b> produced by bacteria, sepsis, trauma, alcoholic hepatitis, ischemia, and hypovolemic shock resulting from acute hemorrhage.|$|E
5|$|Gram-positive {{bacteria}} {{possess a}} thick cell wall containing {{many layers of}} peptidoglycan and teichoic acids. In contrast, gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall consisting of a few layers of peptidoglycan surrounded by a second lipid membrane containing lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins. Lipopolysaccharides, also called <b>endotoxins,</b> are composed of polysaccharides and lipid A {{that is responsible for}} much of the toxicity of gram-negative bacteria. Most bacteria have the gram-negative cell wall, and only the Firmicutes and Actinobacteria have the alternative gram-positive arrangement. These two groups were previously known as the low G+C and high G+C gram-positive bacteria, respectively. These differences in structure can produce differences in antibiotic susceptibility; for instance, vancomycin can kill only gram-positive bacteria and is ineffective against gram-negative pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. If the bacterial cell wall is entirely removed, it is called a protoplast, whereas if it is partially removed, it is called a spheroplast. β-Lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin, inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial cell wall. The enzyme lysozyme, found in human tears, also digests the cell wall of bacteria and is the body's main defence against eye infections.|$|E

In tolerant mice, the labeled <b>endotoxin</b> was found mainly in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) with smaller quantities in the blood, spleen, and liver. Experiments with splenectomized mice provided supporting evidence that the liver was the target organ of the hypoferremic response to <b>endotoxin.</b> High localization of <b>endotoxin</b> in the MLN with lower quantities in the blood, livers, and spleens of tolerant mice indicated that tolerance {{may be the result of}} a blockage by the MLN, preventing the <b>endotoxin</b> from reaching the liver. This inference was supported by the finding that hypoferremic tolerance did not occur when the hypoferremia-provoking dosage of <b>endotoxin</b> (100 μg) was given intravenously to mice pretreated intraperitoneally.

Adult rats were injected with <b>endotoxin</b> (2 mg/kg), PAF (1 microgram/kg) or <b>endotoxin</b> plus PAF, and were killed after 30 min. <b>Endotoxin</b> had little systemic effect.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} {{profile of}} <b>endotoxin</b> liberation by bacterial multiplication and by antibiotic bactericidal action {{was investigated in}} vitro in a bacterial kill-kinetic model and in vivo in a rat E. coli peritonitis/sepsis model. The impact of a derivative of human immunoglobulin G, 5 S-IgG on <b>endotoxin</b> liberation was also assessed. Results demonstrated the antibiotic-induced <b>endotoxin</b> liberation by comparing the <b>endotoxin</b> concentrations after antibiotic administration with the base <b>endotoxin</b> levels. The absolute amount of antibiotic-mediated <b>endotoxin</b> release, however, was no greater than the amount of <b>endotoxin</b> released during bacterial multiplication. This indicates the importance of effective antibiotic therapy in elimination of bacteria, the source of <b>endotoxin.</b> In addition, 5 S-IgG demonstrated its anti-endotoxin activity {{as evidenced by the}} observation of decreased <b>endotoxin</b> concentrations with the presence of 5 S-IgG. ^ The kinetic profile of endotoxin-mediated TNF-α induction was investigated in vitro in human monocyte-enriched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and in vivo in a rat <b>endotoxin</b> septic shock model. In response to <b>endotoxin,</b> PBMC cells produced significant amounts of TNF-α. 5 S-IgG showed its moderate anti-endotoxin activity by partially inhibiting the <b>endotoxin</b> mediated TNF-α release when given before triggering of TNF-α induction. However, this inhibitory effect rapidly diminished when 5 S-IgG was administered after the occurrence of TNF-α induction. Similar results were obtained from animal study in which <b>endotoxin</b> challenge initiated substantial amounts of TNF-α release into the rat circulatory system leading to death. The inhibitory effect of 5 S-IgG on <b>endotoxin</b> mediated TNF-α release and the resultant protective effect against <b>endotoxin</b> lethality were related to the timing of its administration relative to the <b>endotoxin</b> dosing. 5 S-IgG showed its moderate anti-endotoxin activity by partially suppressing the <b>endotoxin</b> mediated TNF-α release and decreasing the overall mortality only when given before triggering of TNF-α induction. Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that the development of grain-negative sepsis may be a self-perpetuating process, which is initiated by the release of <b>endotoxin,</b> and the development of sepsis or its sequelae may no longer be affected by the persistence release of <b>endotoxin</b> into the circulation. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{intestine}} becomes distended due to {{the trapped}} fluid and gas production from bacteria. It is this distension, and subsequent activation of stretch receptors within the intestinal wall, {{that leads to the}} associated pain. With progressive distension of the intestinal wall, there is occlusion of blood vessels, firstly the less rigid veins, then arteries. This impairment of blood supply leads to hyperemia and congestion, and ultimately to ischaemic necrosis and cellular death. The poor blood supply also has effects on the vascular endothelium, leading to an increased permeability which first leaks plasma and eventually blood into the intestinal lumen. In the opposite fashion, gram-negative bacteria and <b>endotoxins</b> can enter the bloodstream, leading to further systemic effects.|$|E

Therefore, a related substudy characterized the relationship between levels of airborne household <b>endotoxin</b> and the level of <b>endotoxin</b> present in house dust, in addition to identifying other significant predictors of airborne <b>endotoxin</b> in the home. We now reexamine the relationship between <b>endotoxin</b> exposure and wheeze under the assumption that the level of airborne <b>endotoxin</b> in the home is the exposure of interest and that the amount of <b>endotoxin</b> in household dust is a surrogate for this exposure.

As a consequence, less <b>endotoxin</b> {{is available to}} activate macrophages, thereby reducing tumor necrosis factor secretion. To determine whether the chylomicron-mediated increase in hepatocellular uptake of <b>endotoxin</b> results in increased <b>endotoxin</b> excretion into bile, we examined bile after <b>endotoxin</b> administration. A sublethal dose (7 micrograms/kg) of 125 I-endotoxin was incubated with either rat mesenteric lymph containing nascent chylomicrons (500 mg of chylomicron triglyceride per kg of body weight) or an equal volume of normal saline (controls) for 3 h and then infused into male Sprague-Dawley rats.

25|$|One of {{the more}} {{dangerous}} indirect effects of SAg infection concerns the ability of SAgs to augment the effects of <b>endotoxins</b> in the body.

40|$|SUMMARY. <b>Endotoxin</b> causes {{release of}} nitric oxide (NO) from {{different}} types of cells. A causative role has been suggested for NO in endotoxin-induced hypotension. In order {{to test the hypothesis}} that NO may be in-volved in the high mortality rate following <b>endotoxin</b> challenge, the competitive NO synthase inhibitors Nw nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and NG methyl L-arginine (L-NMA), or the NOS substrate L-ar-ginine, were administered to rats in the presence and absence of <b>endotoxin.</b> Death rates were examined after drug injection. Urine nitrite concentration and mean arterial blood pressure were examined for 24 h following <b>endotoxin</b> injection. It was found that <b>endotoxin</b> injection increased mortality rates. The mortality rate of rats injected with NOS inhibitors or an NOS substrate concomitantly with <b>endotoxin</b> was similar to that observed in rats treated with <b>endotoxin</b> alone. <b>Endotoxin</b> elicited a decrease in mean arterial blood pressure, whereas treatment with NOS inhibitors prevented this decrease.

In septicemic plague, bacterial <b>endotoxins</b> cause disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), causing tiny clots throughout the body and possibly ischaemic necrosis (tissue death due to lack of circulation/perfusion to that tissue) from the clots. DIC results in depletion of the body's clotting resources, so that it can no longer control bleeding. Consequently, there is bleeding into the skin and other organs, which can cause red and/or black patchy rash and hemoptysis/hematemesis (coughing up/ vomiting of blood). There are bumps on the skin that look somewhat like insect bites; these are usually red, and sometimes white in the center. Untreated, septicemic plague is usually fatal. Early treatment with antibiotics reduces the mortality rate to between 4 and 15 percent. People who die from this form of plague often die on the same day symptoms first appear.|$|E

Thus, at a pH between 4.8 and 6.1, the average charge of albumin molecules is likely to be more negative, while mAbs molecules are positively charged and hence it is possible to separate them. Transferrin, on the other hand, has a pI of 5.9, so it cannot be easily separated by this method. A difference in pI of at least 1 is necessary for a good separation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Endotoxin</b> {{exposure}} {{has been}} associated with asthma exacerbations and increased asthma prevalence. However, there is little data regarding personal exposure to <b>endotoxin</b> in children at risk, or the relation of personal <b>endotoxin</b> exposure to residential or ambient airborne <b>endotoxin.</b> The relation between personal <b>endotoxin</b> and personal air pollution exposures is also unknown. Methods We characterized personal <b>endotoxin</b> exposures in 45 school children with asthma ages 9 - 18 years using 376 repeated measurements from a PM 2. 5 active personal exposure monitor. We also assayed <b>endotoxin</b> in PM 2. 5 samples collected from ambient regional sites (N = 97 days) and from a subset of 12 indoor and outdoor subject home sites (N = 109 and 111 days, respectively) in Riverside and Whittier, California. <b>Endotoxin</b> was measured using the Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate kinetic chromogenic assay. At the same time, we measured personal, home and ambient exposure to PM 2. 5 mass, elemental carbon (EC), and organic carbon (OC). To assess exposure relations we used both rank correlations and mixed linear regression models, adjusted for personal temperature and relative humidity. Results We found small positive correlations of personal <b>endotoxin</b> with personal PM 2. 5 EC and OC, but not personal PM 2. 5 mass or stationary site air pollutant measurements. Outdoor home, indoor home and ambient <b>endotoxin</b> were moderately to strongly correlated with each other. However, in mixed models, personal <b>endotoxin</b> was not associated with indoor home or outdoor home <b>endotoxin,</b> but was associated with ambient <b>endotoxin.</b> Dog and cat ownership were significantly associated with increased personal but not indoor <b>endotoxin.</b> Conclusions Daily fixed site measurements of <b>endotoxin</b> in the home environment may not predict daily personal exposure, although a larger sample size may be needed to assess this. This conclusion is relevant to short-term exposures involved in the acute exacerbation of asthma. </p...|$|R

40|$|Study of the {{experimental}} application of the new <b>endotoxin</b> assay method using MCA-substrate (peptide- 4 -methylcoumarin amide) was carried out. This assay method consists of measurement of endotoxin-induced amidase activity, namely, measurement by a fluorescence spectrophotometer of the released AMC (7 -amino- 4 -methylcoumarin) {{which is due to}} a clotting enzyme in horseshoe crab hemocyte lysate. 1) Using E. coli 0127 : B 8 Lipopolysaccharide B as a standard <b>endotoxin,</b> the <b>endotoxin</b> concentration ranging from 6. 25 pg/mf to 2. 5 μ/ml was quantitatively measured by this assay method. 2) The appropriate heparin concentration for measurement of the plasma <b>endotoxin</b> concentration in the collected blood of rabbits was 10 to 25 unit/ml. The greater the <b>endotoxin</b> concentration added to the plasma of the rabbits, the lower the recovery of the <b>endotoxin</b> was. It seemed that there was a factor in the plasma of the rabbits that decreased the activating ability of the <b>endotoxin</b> for the clotting enzyme in the lysate. 3) In the groups of rabbits injected with 3 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg <b>endotoxin</b> intravenously, the variation rate of the plasma <b>endotoxin</b> concentration had a similar pattern. In both groups, re-elevation of the plasma <b>endotoxin</b> concentration was observed. This re-elevation phenomenon seemed to be due to the entrance of the <b>endotoxin</b> from the rabbit intestinal flora into the systemic circulation, with this “intrinsic endotoxin” seeming to deeply take part in the pathophysiology of the rabbit after <b>endotoxin</b> challenge. 4) Corticosteroid treatment (dexamethazone sodium sulfate, 10 mg/kg i. v.) improved the survival rate of the rabbits receiving 3 mg/kg <b>endotoxin</b> 0 to 70 %. In two groups of rabbits receiving 3 mg/kg and 100 μg/kg <b>endotoxin</b> respectively, the corticosteroid treatment maintained the plasma <b>endotoxin</b> concentration at a level lower than that of the nontreated groups. In the 3 mg/kg group, however, this effect was not observed significantly untill 30 min or more after <b>endotoxin</b> challenge, perhaps indicating a particularly restraining “intrinsic endotoxin” influence. In the 100 μg/kg group, this effect was observed at 1 min after <b>endotoxin</b> challenge. In this group, the corticosteroid treatment seemed to accelerate clearance of administrated <b>endotoxin</b> from the circulating blood...|$|R
