5|$|Imagining the {{creation}} of an artistic community at Upton, Morris helped develop plans for a second house to be constructed adjacent to Red House in which Burne-Jones could live with his family; the plans were abandoned when Burne-Jones' son Philip died from scarlet fever. By 1864, Morris had become increasingly tired of life at Red House, being particularly unhappy with the 3 to 4 <b>hours</b> <b>spent</b> commuting to his London workplace on a daily basis. He sold Red House, and in autumn 1865 moved with his family to No. 26 Queen Square in Bloomsbury, the same building to which the Firm had moved its base of operations earlier in the summer.|$|E
5|$|The FMCSA is a {{division}} of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), which is generally responsible for enforcement of FMCSA regulations. The driver of a CMV is required to keep a record of working hours using a log book, outlining the total number of <b>hours</b> <b>spent</b> driving and resting, as well as the time at which the change of duty status occurred. In lieu of a log book, a motor carrier may keep track of a driver's hours using Electronic Logging Devices (ELDs), which automatically record {{the amount of time spent}} driving the vehicle.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the march, Julian gave {{a speech}} to the {{assembled}} army. Its wording could be read as implying that Julian had already had a fortified marching-camp built (in accordance with standard Roman military practice), or that he was simply proposing to do so. In any case, it appears that Julian, concerned that his men might be too tired to fight after a 6-hour march in the hot sun, urged that the clash be postponed until the following day. But his officers and men {{would have none of it}} and clamoured to be led against the enemy immediately. Julian, who prided himself on acting by consensus, gave way. However, since Ammianus states that the battle and subsequent pursuit ended after sunset, it seems unlikely that the army would have actually engaged at midday straight after the march without a few hours rest and refreshment (and, if a camp was built, a couple of <b>hours</b> <b>spent</b> on that task). It thus seems more likely that battle commenced in the late afternoon.|$|E
25|$|Two express {{passenger}} services run each day between Kiev and Dnipro {{under the name}} 'Capital Express'. Other daytime services include suburban trains to towns and villages in the surrounding Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Most long-distance trains tend to run at night {{to reduce the amount}} of daytime <b>hours</b> <b>spent</b> travelling by each passenger.|$|E

25|$|Hovhaness was {{interested}} in music from a very early age, writing his first composition, a cantata in the early Italian style, {{at the age of}} four after being inspired by hearing a song of Franz Schubert. His family was concerned for his late-night <b>hours</b> <b>spent</b> composing and possibly for his financial future as an artist. He decided for a short time to pursue astronomy, another of his early loves. The fascination of astronomy remained with him through his entire life and composing career, with many works titled after various planets and stars.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 {{retrospective}} {{longitudinal study}} showed that firefighters are at higher risk for certain types of cancer. Firefighters had mesothelioma, which is caused by asbestos exposure, at {{twice the rate of}} the non-firefighting working population. Younger firefighters (under age 65) also developed bladder cancer and prostate cancer at higher rates than the general population. The risk of bladder cancer may be present in female firefighters, but research is inconclusive as of 2014. Preliminary research from 2015 on a large cohort of US firefighters showed a direct relationship between the number of <b>hours</b> <b>spent</b> fighting fires and lung cancer and leukemia mortality in firefighters. This link is a topic of continuing research in the medical community, as is cancer mortality in general among firefighters.|$|E
25|$|Aircraft {{commonly}} flew on-call support missions for allied ground forces, F-15Es usually carried MK-82 and GBU-12 {{bombs in}} this role, other weapons were sometimes carried, during one mission a GBU-28, two GBU-24s and six GBU-12s were released. Frequent targets {{during the rest}} of the war were individual insurgents, light vehicles and supply convoys; cannon fire was often expended as well as bombs from F-15Es. It was during combat over Afghanistan that four 391st crews conducted the longest fighter mission in history; lasting a total of 15.5hours, nine of those <b>hours</b> <b>spent</b> flying over the target area. Two F-15Es attacked two Taliban command and control facilities, two buildings suspected of being used by Taliban fighters, and a road block; the F-15Es refueled 12 times during the mission.|$|E

50|$|The Carnegie rule is a rule {{of thumb}} {{suggesting}} how much outside-of-classroom studytime is required to succeed in an average college course. Typically the Carnegie Rule is reported as two to three hours of outside work required for each <b>hour</b> <b>spent</b> in the classroom.|$|R
25|$|Penn Manor's theatre club is International Thespian Society (ITS) Troupe #274. ITS meets once a {{week during}} {{homeroom}} club period. ITS members earn theatre points for <b>hours</b> <b>spent</b> on theatre work. Upon earning enough points for induction into ITS, students may wear ITS insignia at graduation; however, induction is not required for club participation. ITS activities include an apple dumpling fundraiser, aiding charities such as the TOTS-EAT food drive and Broadway Cares/Equity Fights Aids, attending the state conference, and assisting Penn Manor Productions by serving as ushers for performances. Participation in both ITS and PMP is not required, but most ITS members are active in shows, and most PMP cast/crew are ITS members. ITS Troupe #274 {{is run by a}} group of elected student officers supervised by faculty director and advisers.|$|E
25|$|Many of her MGM films, such as Million Dollar Mermaid and Jupiter's Darling, {{contained}} elaborately staged {{synchronized swimming}} scenes, with considerable risk to Williams. She broke her neck filming a 115ft dive off a tower during a climactic musical {{number for the}} film Million Dollar Mermaid and was in a body cast for seven months. She subsequently recovered, although she continued to suffer headaches {{as a result of}} the accident. Her many <b>hours</b> <b>spent</b> submerged in a studio tank resulted in ruptured eardrums numerous times. She also nearly drowned after not being able to find the trapdoor in the ceiling of a tank. The walls and ceiling were painted black and the trapdoor blended in. Williams was pulled out only because a member of the crew realized the door was not opening.|$|E
25|$|The {{current state}} of {{dissection}} in India is deteriorating. The number of <b>hours</b> <b>spent</b> in dissection labs during medical school have decreased substantially over the last twenty years. The future of anatomy education will probably be an elegant mix of traditional methods and integrative computer learning. The use of dissection in early stages of medical training has been shown more effective in the retention of the intended information than their simulated counterparts. However, there is use for the computer generated experience as review in the later stages. The combination of these methods are intended to strength the students understanding and confidence of anatomy, a subject that is infamously difficult to master. There is a growing need for anatomist—seeing as most anatomy labs are taught by graduates hoping to complete degrees in anatomy—to continue the long tradition of anatomy education.|$|E

25|$|The {{ontogeny}} {{of sleep}} {{is the study}} of sleep across different age groups of a species, particularly during development and aging. Among mammals, infants sleep the longest. Human babies have 8 hours of REM sleep and 8 hours of NREM sleep on an average. The percentage of time spent on each mode of sleep varies greatly in the first few weeks of development and some studies have correlated this to the degree of precociality of the child. Within a few months of postnatal development, there is a marked reduction in percentage of <b>hours</b> <b>spent</b> in REM sleep. By the time the child becomes an adult, he spends about 6–7 hours in NREM sleep and only about an hour in REM sleep. This is true not only of humans, but of many animals dependent on their parents for food. The observation that the percentage of REM sleep is very high in the first stages of development has led to the hypothesis that REM sleep might facilitate early brain development. However, this theory has been contested by other studies.|$|E
25|$|This {{reform was}} {{elaborated}} {{in order to}} attain an education system based {{on the development of}} competences rather than on the transmission of knowledge, and included the development of a system of easily readable and comparable degrees aimed to simplify comparison between qualifications across Europe. The flexibility and transparency enabled students to have their qualifications recognised more widely, facilitating freedom of movement around a more transparent EHEA (European Higher Education Area). This was aided by the establishment of a system of credits {{in the form of the}} European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) and the adoption of the Diploma Supplement by all countries involved. One academic year corresponds to 60 ECTS-credits that are equivalent to 1500–1800 hours of study. The new model comes closer to the North American and Japanese systems. It gives greater weight to practical training, intensive research projects and the way credits are measured reflects how hard a student has worked. The new evaluation methods reflect not only a student's performance on exams, but also his or her lab experiments, presentations, <b>hours</b> <b>spent</b> on study, innovation capacities and so forth.|$|E
500|$|The {{purpose of}} the HOS is to reduce {{accidents}} caused by driver fatigue. [...] As the graph to the right illustrates, the number of <b>hours</b> <b>spent</b> driving has a strong correlation {{to the number of}} fatigue-related accidents. According to numerous studies, the risk of fatigue is also greatest between the hours of midnight and six in the morning, and increases with the total length of the driver's trip.|$|E

500|$|Hours of Service (HOS) {{regulations}} are {{issued by the}} Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) and govern the working hours of anyone operating a commercial motor vehicle (CMV) in the United States. These regulations apply to truck drivers, commercial and city bus drivers, and school bus drivers who operate CMVs.

500|$|In 2011, {{a wide-ranging}} study was {{conducted}} to determine the amount of unpaid household work engaged in by residents of different countries. This study, incorporating the results of time-use surveys from 26 OECD countries, found that, in each country, the average <b>hours</b> <b>spent</b> per day on unpaid household work was between about 2 to 4 hours per day. As domestic work is widely seen as [...] "women's work", the majority of it is performed by women, even for women who also participate in the labor force. One study found that, when adding the time spent on unpaid household work to the time spent engaging in paid work, married mothers accumulate 84 hours of work per week, compared to 79 hours per week for unmarried mothers, and 72 hours per week for all fathers, whether married or not.|$|E
