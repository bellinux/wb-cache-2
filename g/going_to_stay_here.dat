2500|$|Stymied by his union, late in 1968 Miller {{organized}} other ill miners {{into the}} West Virginia Black Lung Association and won {{introduction of a}} black-lung bill in the West Virginia state legislature. [...] When Miller led other miners, their families and supporters on a march on the state capitol, Boyle sent legislators a telegram advising them (as Miller put it) [...] "not to worry about those so-and-so miners." [...] Boyle's behind-the-scenes lobbying {{had a significant effect}} at first. [...] When Miller met {{with the president of the}} state senate, the legislator [...] "told us raggedy miners to go back to the mines where we belonged. I got hot and told him, Mr. Jackson, we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> until the snow flies and we are going to turn you out to pasture.' [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1956, Robeson {{was called}} before HUAC after {{he refused to}} sign an {{affidavit}} affirming {{that he was not}} a Communist. In his testimony, he invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to reveal his political affiliations. When asked why he had not remained in the Soviet Union because of his affinity with its political ideology, he replied, [...] "because my father was a slave and my people died to build , I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here,</b> and have a part of it just like you and no fascist-minded people will drive me from it!" [...] At that hearing, Robeson stated [...] "Whether I am or not a Communist is irrelevant. The question is whether American citizens, regardless of their political beliefs or sympathies, may enjoy their constitutional rights." [...] Robeson's passport was subsequently revoked. Campaigns were launched to protest the passport ban and the restriction of his right to travel over the next four years, but it was to no avail. In 1957, unable to accept invitations to perform abroad, Paul Robeson sang for audiences in London, where 1,000 concert tickets for his telephone concert at St Pancras Town Hall sold out within an hour, and Wales via the transatlantic telephone cable TAT-1: [...] "We have to learn the hard way that there is another way to sing".|$|E
60|$|It was {{not till}} Lord Uplandtowers said roughly, 'Are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> all the morning worshipping him?' that she roused herself.|$|E
6000|$|... "You've {{done very}} well for an invalid," [...] {{observed}} Columbine. Then, changing the subject, she asked, [...] "Wilson, you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> here--winter <b>here,</b> dad would call it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, if you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{talk that}} way, I won't stand {{in with you}} any longer!" [...] cried Jackson, in a rage. [...] "That money is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> right <b>here,</b> where I {{and all the rest}} of us can keep our eyes on it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For the Lord's sake honey," [...] cried Esmeralda. [...] "You all don't {{mean to tell}} ME that you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> right <b>here</b> in {{this here}} land of carnivable animals when you all got the {{opportunity}} to escapade on that boat? Don't you tell me THAT, honey." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All I know is," [...] {{continued}} Miss Rose, positively, [...] "I {{wish you}} were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> another six months for father's sake." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is, my {{degenerate}} friend," [...] replied Bridge; [...] "and furthermore he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> and {{be perfectly}} safe. Do you grasp me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She won't wake, until {{long after}} you've got back; I'll answer for that. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> awhile. Go! I'll take the responsibility." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't deny it," [...] {{answered}} Wicks, {{and stood}} a while {{as if in}} thought. [...] "But what I can't make out," [...] he began again, with agitation, [...] "what I can't make out is what you're made of! <b>To</b> <b>stay</b> in this place is beyond me. There's the bloody sun <b>going</b> down--and <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> is beyond me." ...|$|R
6000|$|Pat laughed. [...] "Not so that you'd notice it, me bye. We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> right <b>here.</b> The storm's {{not over}} yet, {{and if it}} keeps on I'm {{thinking}} we'll be buried completely. However, {{it looks to me}} as if it will break away shortly, and then you'll have a chance to show what good little diggers they raise in Noo Yor-r-k." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, I'll {{tell you}} what: I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> right <b>here.</b> We will both see him; it's right {{for us to}} do it." [...] But at a rap on the parlor door Mrs. Kenton flew to that of her own room, which she closed upon her with a sort of Parthian whimper, [...] "Oh, do be careful, Rufus!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here.</b> If you go-I'll never be your wife-again-never!" [...] She {{glanced at the}} {{sleeping}} children, and her chin trembled.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, {{you make}} me duck-hungry already!" [...] cried Whopper. [...] "Let's go on, unless we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> {{for the rest of}} the day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop talking!" [...] he bellowed. [...] "Stop {{talking like}} an idiot! I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> till that girl comes out, if {{have to wait}} all day!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} Dampier dryly. [...] "I {{was kind}} of afraid of that, but I choked him off. Anyway, this year won't see us back in Vancouver." [...] He paused. [...] "We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> up <b>here</b> until we find out where those men left their bones. The man who has this thing in hand isn't the kind that lets up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite right, Sammy! Quite right!" [...] Peter exclaimed. [...] "I wouldn't {{have thought}} of that. My, won't she be happy when you do tell her! I wonder what she'll say and what she'll do. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> right <b>here</b> so as to see her when she hears the good news. Here comes your cousin, Blacky the Crow. Does he know yet?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} be afraid of me, mother," [...] he replied, wearily; [...] "but you must not ask me to believe in your voices {{and all the rest}} of it. It's too unnatural and too foolish. But you're my good little mother all the same, and I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> desert you. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> right <b>here</b> and help you fight it out." ...|$|R
6000|$|Breckenridge made {{a gesture}} of resignation. [...] "Then I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> {{most of the night}} by myself. It's doleful. I'll ride over to Muller's now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have had}} no letters. Are you really <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here?</b> Has your {{experience}} of last night not altered the opinion which you expressed to me yesterday?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{have had}} such a {{pleasant}} time,' he said ruefully, 'and if this fellow is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> I can see it is {{all going to be}} spoilt.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's true, but I reckon {{when you}} came to fire on that ghost your hand would be so shaky that you couldn't hit the side of a barn," [...] {{answered}} the old hermit. [...] "After I saw that spirit I felt like I had a chill. I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> up <b>here</b> another night---it's bad enough to be here in the daytime." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Dampier drily. [...] "I {{was kind}} of afraid of that, but I choked him off. Anyway, this year won't see us back in Vancouver." [...] He paused, with a little jarring laugh. [...] "We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> up <b>here</b> until we find out where those men left their bones. The man who has this thing in hand isn't the kind that lets up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Old bones don't {{rest and}} recover {{as quickly as}} young bones, and I just don't feel equal <b>to</b> <b>going</b> over there now," [...] said she. [...] "The truth is, Reddy, I am growing old. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> right <b>here</b> and rest. Perhaps then I'll feel able to go hunting to-night. You trot along now, {{and if you get}} more than a stomachful, just {{remember}} old Granny and bring her a bite." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, Miss Swancourt: dearest Elfie! {{we heard}} you. Are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here?</b> You are our little mamma, are you not--our big mamma is gone to London,' said one.|$|E
6000|$|... "I and {{my family}} are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> to-night," [...] {{announced}} Mr. Laning; [...] "so {{we can go on}} a hunt for that man first thing in the morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mamma," [...] said Emmeline, walking {{first into}} the drawing-room, [...] "Lady Clara has come back with us after all, and is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> to-night; we are so glad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not quite}} {{through with it}} yet;" [...] and Jimmy, who did not pass it to him, smiled reassuringly. [...] "Anyway, I wouldn't {{worry too much about}} Merril. I've a few dollars laid by, and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> right <b>here</b> and look after you. Bob Prescott tells me the Siwash wants to go ashore, and that makes a berth for me. It's {{scarcely}} likely the Company will want me for three months or more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{leave you}} {{chained to the}} rock, Andromeda? Not for Perseus! I've only been here one night, but I've seen {{enough to know that}} I've got to take you away from this place. Honestly, it's killing you. I was {{watching}} you last night. You're scared if that infernal old woman starts to open her mouth. She's crushing the life out of you. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> on <b>here</b> till you say you'll marry me, or till they throw me out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{positively}} eloquent to-night--both of you," [...] she declared. [...] "But, you see, appearances {{are very much}} against me. He knew my name, and also that I {{had been living in}} Paris, and a man doesn't risk claiming a girl for his wife, as a rule, for nothing. He was painfully in earnest, too. I think you will find that his story will be believed, whatever I say; and in any case, if he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> on <b>here,</b> I shall have to go away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{she said}} in a coldly even voice, [...] "you need not trouble. I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here.</b> Have they shown you our dripping-well yet, Mr. Leland?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He stopped, {{and looked}} at Leger. [...] "I can't push on to-night--I'm 'most used-up, but I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> and make trouble for you. I'll light out again to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> {{until your}} arm is seen to. My husband {{would not be}} pleased {{if we did not}} do {{everything}} we could for you," [...] she said.|$|E
60|$|GEORGE. Yes. I've chosen my life. It isn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{be divided}} between a Wall Street office and Newport and Palm Beach. A girl {{out of a}} {{finishing}} school wouldn't be of any use <b>to</b> me. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> right <b>here</b> in Foxon Falls, Minnie, I've got a real job on my hands, and I need a real woman with special knowledge to help me. I don't mean to say we won't have vacations, and we'll sit down and get our education together. Dr. Jonathan will be the schoolmaster.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, you don't!" [...] {{declared}} Jimmy Skunk. [...] "You are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> right <b>here</b> {{where we}} {{can take care of}} you. It wouldn't be safe for you to try to go to the Old Briar-patch now, because if you should meet Old Man Coyote or Reddy Fox or Whitetail the Marshhawk, you {{would not be able to}} run fast enough to get away. I will go down and tell Mrs. Peter, and you will make yourself comfortable in the old house behind that stump where I was hiding." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I {{think this}} will do for Reddy Fox and his relatives. Reddy is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> right <b>here</b> with me, until {{the rest of you}} {{have had a chance to}} get home. After that you will have to watch out for yourselves as usual. Just {{remember}} that Reddy has become the quick-witted person he is because he has been so much hunted. If you are as smart as Reddy, you will understand that the more he hunts you, the quicker-witted you also will become. To-morrow we will take up Reddy's big cousins, the Wolves." ...|$|R
