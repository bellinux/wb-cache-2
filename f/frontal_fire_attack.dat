50|$|Ogawa {{found that}} the B-29s were more {{vulnerable}} when they were maintaining level flight in their bombing runs and could not employ evasive maneuvers. Exploiting this weakness during night actions, he shot two of the bombers down by <b>frontal</b> <b>attack,</b> <b>firing</b> at the nose. He continued with his aerial successes and by August 1945 when the war ended, he had built up a confirmed score of seven B-29 bombers downed, {{as well as two}} P-51 Mustang fighters. This made him the highest scoring pilot against B-29s in the 70th Sentai, his air group. By the order of General Shizuichi Tanaka, on 9 July 1945 Ogawa was awarded the Bukosho, the highest military honor given to living IJA personnel during World War II. At the same time he was commissioned as an officer with the rank of second lieutenant.|$|R

40|$|The {{problem was}} Las Vegas Fire and Rescue {{did not know}} if their {{employees}} were being exposed to unacceptable levels of carbon monoxide (CO) during post <b>fire</b> <b>attack</b> operations (overhaul, <b>fire</b> investigation, evidence retrieval etc.). The purpose of this research project was to determine if gasoline powered smoke blowers could reduce carbon monoxide levels inside a structure during post <b>fire</b> <b>attack</b> operations to an acceptable level. The evaluative research method was used. The research questions to be answered were: 1. What is the acceptable level of carbon monoxide in a structure for a firefighter to work in without self contained breathing apparatus? 2. Does a gasoline powered smoke blower introduce a significant amount of carbon monoxide into a structure? 3. Can a gas powered smoke blower reduce the carbon monoxide within a structure to an acceptable level during post <b>fire</b> <b>attack</b> operations...|$|R
