6000|$|... "I don't want {{to think}} of it," [...] the girl answered, {{frowning}} slightly. [...] "It makes my head ache. Nobody has a right to so much money. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> out?" [...] I laughed. [...] "I had no {{opportunity}} to ask him! This evening, you see," [...] I pursued, [...] "he {{has not been able}} to get in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Before we go any further," [...] he said, [...] "let's get {{one thing}} clear. Who is this Mr. Scobell? <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> {{mixed up in}} this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will let}} that pass for the present," [...] said the Senator. [...] "There he is, however {{he may be}} paid. <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> there?" [...] Now {{it was the fact}} that Mr. Mainwaring's living had been bought for him with his wife's money,--a fact of which Mr. Gotobed was not aware, but which he would hardly have {{regarded}} had he known it. [...] "How <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are {{you trying}} to stuff me with nonsense?" [...] asked Johnny Chuck indignantly. [...] "How can he fasten his nest {{to the side of}} a chimney unless there's a little shelf to put it on? And if <b>he</b> never alights, <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> the little sticks to make a nest of? I'd just like to know how you expect me to believe any such story as that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To be sure! Why didn't I {{think of}} that?" [...] came from Whopper. [...] "Sure as you're a foot high {{that is the}} circus lion. But <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> away out here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, yes; and <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> on there? I cannot {{conceive}} poor Johnny keeping holiday {{with the}} earl and his sister. How did he behave to them, {{and how did}} they behave to him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{it was an}} enemy, it is {{your coat}} of mail has saved me," [...] he continued, turning to Van Duyk. [...] "I have never taken it off since. But <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> behind me I wonder? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Two days ago!" [...] {{repeated}} Roger. [...] "Then Porton {{must have}} come here right after leaving the hotel in Lamont. <b>How</b> ever <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> here?" ...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this theses are the films of Lithuanian avant-garde artist, organizator and {{original}} interpreter of life, Jonas Mekas. Specifically I'm dealing {{with the development of}} his work from the complex film-diaritical sagas to video pieces presented on his web side. I'm exploaring where <b>does</b> <b>he</b> see the diference between the way he captures life and what we call documentary film, what does a reality means to him and <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> closer to it's essence {{with the help of his}} camera. I'm observing <b>how</b> <b>did</b> the recent technical development effected his work - the arrival of video, computers and subsequently internet. I'm trying to understand where does diary-film stand in the frame of history of cinema and where is it's place in the context of the contemporary art scene...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, I say," [...] remarked {{the police}} sergeant, whose slow, bucolic common sense was still pondering the open window. [...] "It's {{all very well}} your saying that a man escaped by wading this moat, but what I ask you is, <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> ever <b>get</b> into the house at all if the bridge was up?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{not a bit}} to blame," [...] said Mrs. Aleshine; [...] "but I'll {{look into}} this thing. No fear about that! An' how did he come {{to go to my}} house? An' <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> in, I'd like to know?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{presume that}} means he went to Victoria for the extra stores this morning; but <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> there? It must be some distance, from what I know of the coast, {{and he would have}} a {{head-wind}} all the way back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here is the fellow's cap," [...] he said. [...] "You {{must have}} hit him a shrewd blow, Charlie, for {{here is a}} clean cut through the cloth, and a patch of fresh blood on the white lining. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> you down, lad?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dead! he's {{bound to}} be dead, under all that weight. But <b>how</b> the dickens <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> into the cart? Guess we didn't shovel him in, eh; we'd have seen him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I never!" [...] she gasped. [...] "John Osborne, do {{you mean}} to tell me that Bryan Lee is going to <b>do</b> that? <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> come to <b>get</b> your mortgage?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hopper!" [...] {{cried the}} General, with feeling. [...] "Eliphalet Hopper. As long as I live I shall never forget it. <b>How</b> the devil <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> a permit? What are they about at Washington?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Why had Harold {{sent her}} the letter? His own words {{said that it}} should be in her hands. Then, again, he said it might comfort her to know the letter was safe. How could it comfort her? <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> {{possession}} of the letter? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{mind the}} darned stitches. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> ahead of us? We hustled all we knew. It's downright {{impossible}} {{for anyone to}} get here quicker than we did. And, anyway, how did he know? Do you reckon there was a dictaphone in Jane's room? I guess there must have been." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> command?" [...] inquired Mabel, with an earnestness and {{interest}} that quite delighted her simple-minded and true-hearted companion, {{who was never}} better pleased than when he had an opportunity of saying aught {{in favor of a}} friend. [...] "It is honorable to him that he has reached this station while yet so young." ...|$|E
6000|$|Somehow he had {{my hands}} in his. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> ever <b>get</b> them? I was sure I had them safely tucked out of harm's way behind me. [...] "You know, Kitty, that I love you. I am a poor man--perhaps I may never be {{anything}} else--and this may seem to you very presumptuous. But I cannot let you go like this. Will you be my wife, dear?" ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Generating a {{distributed}} key, where {{a constant}} {{fraction of the}} players can reconstruct the key, is {{an essential component of}} threshold cryptography. Previous solutions are based on univariate polynomials. We present a new distributed key generation (DKG) protocol. The key idea of our scheme is to use bivariate symmetric polynomial. Compared with other solutions, our construction is efficient in computation and simple and flexible in applications. In addition, our construction admits a rigorous proof of security. We also study the new-member-joining problem which often occurs in some applications: Players P 1, [...] ., Pn, who make up a group G, have jointly generated a pair of private and public keys based on some DKG, when a new player hope to join in G, <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> a share of private key? We present a new-member-joining protocol which is based on our DKG scheme and which completely solve this problem. we also give a proof of the security of this new-member-joining protocol in terms of correctness and secrecy...|$|R
6000|$|... "But good Heavens, Eug√®ne," [...] said Belturbet hoarsely, [...] "what {{has become}} of-- Why, there he is! <b>How</b> on earth <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> there?" [...] And he pointed with a shaking finger towards {{a semblance of}} the {{vanished}} Minister, which approached once more along the unfrequented path.|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> off the island?" [...] {{demanded the}} captain, turning round to look {{his son in}} the face. [...] "The arm of the sea is quite half-a- mile in width, at that point--how did he cross it {{in the face of}} a victorious army?--or did he only save himself, while you {{captured}} his troops?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{hold on a}} minute!" [...] {{broke in}} Sam. [...] "You got the money at Knoxbury, and this attack {{took place on the}} road above here, which is at least seven miles from that place. Now, if the man who did the deed was at the bank when you drew the money, <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> here in time to hold you up?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> {{her away}} from the Kaffirs? It seems almost an impossibility. I asked the head man of the Fingoes, who was with him," [...] another said, [...] "but he had already got three parts drunk, so I did not get much out of him; but as far as I could make out, they carried her off from Macomo's kraal {{in the heart of the}} Amatolas." ...|$|E
5000|$|Bonnie and Clyde {{went on to}} be a {{critical}} and commercial success, despite the early misgivings by studio head Jack Warner, who put up the production money. Before filming began, Warner had asked an associate, [...] "What does Warren Beatty think <b>he's</b> <b>doing?</b> <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> ever <b>get</b> us into this thing? This gangster stuff went out with Cagney." [...] The film was nominated for ten Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor, and seven Golden Globe Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor.|$|R

Through the process of realizing <b>how</b> to <b>do</b> that, <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> blinded and loses himself in the pursuit of it and goes a little crazy‚Äî'a little' being an understatement." ...|$|R

60|$|In {{the fall}} of 1898, Steve and I poled up the Yukon on the last water, bound for Stewart River. We took the dogs along, all except Spot. We figured we'd been feeding him long enough. He'd cost us more time and trouble and money and grub than we'd got by selling him on the Chilcoot--especially grub. So Steve and I tied him down in the cabin and pulled our freight. We camped {{that night at the}} mouth of Indian River, and Steve and I were pretty facetious over having shaken him. Steve was a funny fellow, and I was just sitting up in the {{blankets}} and laughing when a tornado hit camp. The way that Spot walked into those dogs and gave them what-for was hair-raising. Now <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> loose? It's up to you. I haven't any theory. And <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> across the Klondike River? That's another facer. And anyway, how did he know we had gone up the Yukon? You see, we went by water, and he couldn't smell our tracks. Steve and I began to get superstitious about that dog. He got on our nerves, too; and, between you and me, we were just a mite afraid of him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Time we had {{a mouthful}} to eat," [...] said a voice at his side. It was Mr Franklin, the chief mate, with his head sunk between his shoulders, and melancholy eyes. [...] "Let the men have their breakfast, bo'sun," [...] he went on, [...] "and have the fire out in the galley {{in half an hour}} at the latest, so that we can call these barges of {{explosives}} alongside. Come along, young man. I don't know your name. Haven't seen the captain, to speak to, since yesterday afternoon when he rushed off to pick up a second mate somewhere. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> you?" ...|$|E
60|$|In Brussels once I {{witnessed}} a daring attempt by a lawless foreigner {{to enter a}} tram from the wrong side. The gate was open: he was standing close beside it. A line of traffic was in his way: to have got round {{to the right side}} of that tram would have meant missing it. He entered when the conductor was not looking, and took his seat. The astonishment of the conductor on finding him there was immense. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> there? The conductor had been watching the proper entrance, and the man had not passed him. Later, the true explanation suggested itself to the conductor, but for a while he hesitated to accuse a fellow human being of such crime.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} you must find your period of {{probation}} very slow. [...] Poor boy! what <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> No billiards, no cards, no betting-- [...] <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> manage to <b>get</b> through the day at all? Smokes, I [...] suppose, and looks out of the window, and tells all his grievances [...] to Mr. Von Baumser. Aren't you sorry that ever you made the [...] acquaintance of Morrison's second floor front? Poor Toby! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Confound the luck! <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> {{manage to}} <b>get</b> on my trail so quickly?" [...] muttered the former moving-picture actor to himself. [...] "Now I'll {{have to lay}} low and {{do my best to}} sneak off to some other place. I wish it wasn't so cold. When I stop running I'll be half frozen. But, anyway, I had the {{satisfaction}} of giving him one in the ear with that rock and another in the shoulder with my foot," [...] and he smiled grimly, as he placed his handkerchief to his bleeding nose.|$|R
5000|$|Officers opened {{negotiations}} for surrender but Johnson {{said he would}} speak to black police officers only. He {{also said that he}} acted alone and was not part of any group. According to Chief Brown, Johnson appeared delusional during his standoff, [...] "We had negotiated with him for about two hours, and he just basically lied to us, playing games, laughing at us, singing, asking <b>how</b> many <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> and that <b>he</b> wanted to kill some more." [...] By about 2:30 a.m., Chief Brown saw no possibility of negotiating further and made the decision to use a bomb disposal remote control vehicle armed with about 1 lb of C-4 explosive. The plan was to move the robot to a point against a wall facing Johnson and then detonate the explosives. Johnson saw the robot approaching and fired repeatedly at it in an attempt to stop it. However, the robot exploded as intended, killing Johnson immediately. The robot, while sustaining damage to its extended arm, was still functional.|$|R
