5|$|Dio and Martial record some of {{the animals}} that were exhibited. Dio notes a hunt {{involving}} cranes and another involving four elephants, and Martial mentions elephants, lions, leopards, at least one tiger, hares, pigs, bulls, bears, wild boar, a rhinoceros, buffalo and bison (most likely the wisent). Other exotic animals {{may have been used}} but are not mentioned; ostriches, camels and crocodiles were commonly used in the games. Giraffes are unlikely to have been featured; Julius Caesar <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> single giraffe to Rome in 46 BC. Another is not recorded in Europe until the Medici giraffe in 1486, although they were first seen in Rome in 58 BC, and were impressive enough to be detailed in the games of Augustus and Commodus, {{there is no mention of}} hippopotami at Titus' games.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{a genetic}} study was made basing on the {{evolutionary}} history of common elands. Located in the sub-Saharan savanna biome of east and southern Africa, the study used methods like analysis of mitochondrial DNA control-region fragments from 122 individuals {{to learn more}} about various topics, such as the phylogeography, genetic diversity, demographic history of the species. The conclusions strongly supported the presence of a longer-standing population in the south and a mosaic of Pleistocene refugia in the east. It is believed that today their extinction from these parts could be due to colonization. The similarity of dates obtained from more studies indicates a significant event c. 200 ka, which <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> great change in the genetic history of the species.|$|E
5|$|The native Britons had {{converted}} to Christianity under Roman rule. The Anglo-Saxon invasions separated the British church from European Christianity for centuries, so {{the church in}} Rome had no presence or authority in Britain, and in fact, Rome knew so little about the British church that it was unaware of any schism in customs. However, Æthelberht would have known something about the Roman church from his Frankish wife, Bertha, who <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> bishop, Liudhard, with her across the Channel, and for whom Æthelberht built a chapel, St Martin's.|$|E

5|$|In 595, when Pope Gregory I {{decided to}} send a mission to the Anglo-Saxons, the Kingdom of Kent was ruled by Æthelberht. He had married a Christian princess named Bertha before 588, and perhaps earlier than 560. Bertha was the {{daughter}} of Charibert I, one of the Merovingian kings of the Franks. As one of the conditions of her marriage she <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> bishop named Liudhard with her to Kent as her chaplain. They restored a church in Canterbury that dated to Roman times, possibly the present-day St Martin's Church. Æthelberht was at that time a pagan but he allowed his wife freedom of worship. Liudhard {{does not appear to have}} made many converts among the Anglo-Saxons, and if not for the discovery of a gold coin, the Liudhard medalet, bearing the inscription Leudardus Eps (Eps is an abbreviation of Episcopus, the Latin word for bishop) his existence may have been doubted. One of Bertha's biographers states that, influenced by his wife, Æthelberht requested Pope Gregory to send missionaries. The historian Ian Wood feels that the initiative came from the Kentish court as well as the queen.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of such initiatives, Romania {{tended to}} give little {{attention}} to the potential of recruitment in Russia, as many decision-makers were still uncertain about the devotion of Transylvanians and Bukovinans, and worried that they might be welcoming Austro-Hungarian spies into army ranks. Additionally, probably half of the 120,000 men excluded themselves from the pool of recruits, as Austrian loyalists, invalids or men who had reason to fear Austria-Hungary's retaliation. Support from within Romania was therefore weak, and Russian obstruction still had a part to play, but in January the camp was visited by Lieutenant Colonel Constantin Gh. Pietraru of the Romanian Land Forces, on a mission to evaluate the recruitment project. The reversal of fortunes on the Romanian front <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> Central Powers' invasion into southern Romania, and the Romanian military authority became pressured into finding new soldiers for the defensive action.|$|E

25|$|The rise {{of modern}} {{antisemitism}} {{together with the}} rise of nationalism and the nation state <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> wave of antisemitism as Jews struggled to gain their rights as equal citizens.

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 205 BC, a Carthaginian fleet emerged {{suddenly}} at the Ligurian coast.

25|$|Republican {{victories}} in the elections of 1946 <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> much more conservative Congress to Washington, with a determination to curb labor.

25|$|After Castro {{was sworn}} in as Cuba's Prime Minister, he visited the United States in April 1959. One evening in New York, Cobb {{accompanied}} Agüero to the Statler Hotel where she was introduced to Castro. She <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> copy of the translated speech. Castro was pleased when he saw the booklet she had made and ordered a print run of 1,000 copies to be made and distributed in New York. Cobb also met Castro's private secretary Celia Sánchez, who invited her to Havana to work under Castro in the Ministry Office.|$|E
25|$|Henrietta Maria <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> {{large and}} {{expensive}} retinue with her from France, all Catholic. Charles blamed the poor start to his marriage on this French entourage. Charles finally had them dismissed {{from the court}} on 26 June 1626. Henrietta Maria was greatly upset, and initially some– including the Bishop of Mendes– refused to leave, citing his orders from the French King. In the end, Charles had to deploy armed guards to physically eject them. Despite Charles's orders, however, Henrietta Maria managed to retain seven of her French staff including her chaplain and confessor, Robert Phillip.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, he {{was still}} in {{financial}} difficulties, having lost most of his American investments in the Wall Street Crash. He was criticised for holidaying in the Riviera and America as the guest of such people as Beaverbrook and William Randolph Hearst, and for drinking and gambling with people such as Brendan Bracken and, until his early death, Lord Birkenhead. These attacks were not new; in 1922 Churchill <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> successful libel action against Lord Alfred Douglas who had accused Churchill of giving a deliberately false account of the Battle of Jutland at the request of Sir Ernest Cassel. During the trial it emerged that Cassell, whose company remained Churchill's publisher, had paid for some of the furnishings of Churchill's London residence.|$|E
25|$|Fascist {{governments in}} both Italy and Germany privatized {{state-owned}} enterprises at certain times. These privatizations {{were carried out}} {{in the early stages of}} both regimes (1922-25 for Italy and 1934-37 for Germany), and represented a reversal of the policies of the democratic governments which had preceded them. The democratic governments <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> number of industries under state ownership, and the fascists decided to return them to private ownership. In doing so, they went against the mainstream economic trends of their time, when most Western governments were increasing state ownership. Fascist privatization policies were driven by a desire to secure the support of wealthy industrialists, as well as by the need to increase government revenues in order to balance budgets. Significantly, fascist governments were among the first to undertake large-scale privatizations in modern times.|$|E
25|$|Britain and France {{both had}} {{significant}} colonial possessions in India {{and had been}} battling for supremacy {{for a number of}} years. The British were represented by the British East India Company (EIC) who were permitted to raise troops. The collapse of the long-standing Mughal Empire brought the clash between the two states to a head, as each tried to gain sufficient power and territory to dominate the other. The 1754 Treaty of Pondicherry which ended the Second Carnatic War <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> temporary truce to India, but it was soon under threat. A number of smaller Indian Princely States aligned with either Britain or France. One of the most assertive of these Princes was the pro-French Nawab of Bengal, Siraj ud-Daulah, who resented the British presence in Calcutta. In 1756 he had succeeded his grandfather Alivardi Khan who had been a staunch British ally. By contrast he regarded the British East India Company as an encroaching threat.|$|E

25|$|On 23 August 1944 Lieutenant Colonel Bradbrooke was {{appointed}} to the General Staff at Canadian Military Headquarters in London with Major Eadie taking temporary control of the battalion. Three days later, on 26 August 1944, the 6th Airborne Division was pulled from the line in Normandy. Of the 27 officers and 516 men from the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion {{who took part in the}} Battle of Normandy, 24 officers and 343 men gave their lives. The unit had to be re-organized and retrained in order to regain its strength and combat-readiness. The Battle of Normandy <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> major change to the way the war was fought. Airborne troops needed new training to prepare for an offensive role, including street fighting and capturing enemy positions. On 6 September the Battalion left Normandy and returned to the Bulford training camp in the United Kingdom. While there, Lieutenant Colonel Jeff Nicklin became battalion commander.|$|E
