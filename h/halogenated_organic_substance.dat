40|$|We have {{calculated}} the (13) C NMR chemical shifts {{of a large}} ensemble of <b>halogenated</b> <b>organic</b> molecules (81 molecules {{for a total of}} 250 experimental (13) C NMR data at four different levels of theory), ranging from small rigid organic compounds, used to benchmark the performance of various levels of theory, to natural substances of marine origin with conformational degrees of freedom. Carbon atoms bonded to heavy halogen atoms, particularly bromine and iodine, are known to be rather challenging {{when it comes to the}} prediction of their chemical shifts by quantum methods, due to relativistic effects. In this paper, we have applied the state-of-the-art four-component relativistic density functional theory for the prediction of such NMR properties and compared the performance with two-component and nonrelativistic methods. Our results highlight the necessity to include relativistic corrections within a four-component description for the most accurate prediction of the NMR properties of <b>halogenated</b> <b>organic</b> <b>substances...</b>|$|R
40|$|This PhD thesis {{investigates the}} {{transport}} {{and distribution of}} short-lived <b>halogenated</b> <b>organic</b> <b>substances</b> in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) in the Pacific Ocean. Short-lived halocarbons {{are one of the}} major groups of the ozone depleting substances as they provide a source for the active halogens which decrease ozone in the atmosphere. The TTL serves as the primary gateway of tropospheric air to enter the stratosphere. The air which enters the stratosphere is distributed all over the globe. Thus, the research on which tropospheric air masses go into the TTL, its structure and composition and the transport within is crucial. This thesis uses the UK Meteorological Office Lagrangian particle dispersion model NAME to (i) support the flight planning activities and achieve the multi aircraft coordination in CAST, CONTRAST, ATTREX 2014 campaigns, and (ii) quantify the amount and distribution of short-lived halocarbons in the TTL, and explain differences in these vertical distributions and transport characteristics. The halocarbons of interest are methyl iodide (CH 3 I), bromoform (CHBr 3) and dibromomethane (CH 2 Br 2). A new NAME procedure was developed and operated successfully to provide routine simulations and near real-time products suitable for guiding the CAST, CONTRAST and ATTREX aircraft in order to achieve their mission scientific objectives, and to make coordinated measurements. NAME was used post-campaign to analyse distribution of short-lived halocarbons in the TTL, identify their source regions and transport timescales. A new approach is proposed to investigate the TTL composition in terms of the boundary layer air influence, and subsequently quantify CH 3 I, CHBr 3 and CH 2 Br 2 by estimating their boundary layer and background contribution. The sums of these modelled estimates are in good agreement with the ATTREX 2014 and 2013 CH 3 I, CHBr 3 and CH 2 Br 2 observations. The quantification of the contribution of short-lived bromocarbons to the active bromine in the TTL was achieved, and the results lie within the range of the recent literature studies. The final focus of this thesis is on how well NAME represents the particle displacement via convection. Convection is the major transport pathway for the short-lived halocarbons to reach the TTL. The role of convection in transporting CH 3 I, CHBr 3 and CH 2 Br 2 to the TTL is assessed using the new convection scheme in NAME. A validation of the performance of this scheme is provided, showing that it yields improved and more realistic representation of the particle displacement via convection.

40|$|Cleaning {{agents and}} {{disinfectants}} from housekeeping, hospitals and canteen kitchens are important sources of adsorbable <b>halogenated</b> <b>organic</b> compounds (AOX) in municipal wastewater. They often contain inorganic compounds which {{are able to}} release activated chlorine. Together with organic wastewater compounds the activated chlorine can generate <b>halogenated</b> <b>organic</b> compounds. Within {{the scope of this}} research project the generation of AOX through these active agents is compared. The effects of different reaction parameters like concentration, pH, time or temperature are investigated and discussed. For the investigations the most common active agents sodium hypochlorite, dichloroisocyanuric acid sodium salt and trichloroisocyanuric acid were tested for their potential of chlorination by reacting with selected <b>organic</b> <b>substances.</b> The selected substances were on the one hand organic compounds with different molecular structures and reactivity, on the other hand real municipal wastewater. The amount of AOX generated strongly depends on the nature and concentration of dissolved and solid organic compounds, the concentration of active substances, the temperature, pH and the reaction time. The generation of AOX can also form toxic compounds. So, toxic chloroanilines are found by gaschromatography/mass spectrometry, generated from the metabolism product indole by reacting with activated chlorine. According to the results, generation of AOX is an important non-point source of AOX in sewage. (orig.)

40|$|Total organic halogen (TOX) is a {{collective}} parameter and a toxicity indicator {{for all the}} <b>halogenated</b> <b>organic</b> disinfection byproducts (DBPs) in a water sample. TOX measurement involves concentration of <b>halogenated</b> <b>organic</b> DBPs by adsorption onto activated carbon. Prior to activated carbon adsorption, quenching the chlorine residual in a water sample is an indispensable step to eliminate the positive interference resulting from continued chlorination with organic compounds adsorbed on the activated carbon surface or with the activated carbon surface itself. Arsenite is generally applied as the quenching agent. In this study, the arsenite quenching agent dose that was 100 % of the stoichiometric amount of the chlorine residual in a water sample was demonstrated to be most appropriate. In practice, to ensure complete reduction of chlorine residual, slight overdose of arsenite is often recommended, but this was found to cause negative interferences in the TOX measurement due to two reasons. First, the competitive adsorption existed between <b>halogenated</b> <b>organic</b> DBPs and the excessive arsenite on the activated carbon. This competitive adsorption effect was pronounced within a quenching time of 15 min. After 15 min of quenching, a large fraction of arsenite might have reacted with some easily-reduced halogenated DBPs to become arsenate, which is partially ionized at pH 2 and less likely adsorbed on the activated carbon. In this case, more <b>halogenated</b> <b>organic</b> DBPs could be adsorbed on the activated carbon, resulting in the measured TOX concentrations to be {{much closer to the}} actual one contained in the sample. Second, excessive arsenite might lead to reduction or decomposition of <b>halogenated</b> <b>organic</b> DBPs with a prolonged quenching time (> 60 min). Thus, to avoid the negative interferences, the appropriate quenching time should be 15 - 60 min...|$|R

40|$|I have {{developed}} a novel approach to test for toxic <b>organic</b> <b>substances</b> adsorbed onto ultra fine particulate particles present in the ambient air in Northeast Houston, Texas. These particles are predominantly carbon soot with an aerodynamic diameter (AD) of 3 ̆c 2. 5 μm. If present in the ambient air, many of the <b>organic</b> <b>substances</b> will be absorbed {{to the surface of}} the particles (which act just like a charcoal air filter), and may be adducted into the respiratory system. Once imbedded into the lungs these particles may release the adsorbed toxic <b>organic</b> <b>substances</b> with serious health consequences. I used a Airmetrics portable Minivol air sampler time drawing the ambient air through collection filters samples from 6 separate sites in Northeast Houston, an area known for high ambient PM 2. 5 released from chemical plants and other sources (e. g. vehicle emissions). (1) In practice, the mass of the collected particles were much less than the mass of the filters. My technique was designed to release the adsorbed <b>organic</b> <b>substances</b> on the fine carbon particles by heating the filter samples that included the PM 2. 5 particles prior to identification by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GCMS). The results showed negligible amounts of target chemicals from the collection filters. However, the filters alone released <b>organic</b> <b>substances</b> and GCMS could not distinguish between the <b>organic</b> <b>substances</b> released from the soot particles from those released from the heated filter fabric. However, an efficacy tests of my method using two wax burning candles that released soot revealed high levels of benzene. This suggests that my method has the potential to reveal the <b>organic</b> <b>substances</b> adsorbed onto the PM 2. 5 for analysis. In order to achieve this goal, I must refine the particle collection process which would be independent of the filters; the filters upon heating also release <b>organic</b> <b>substances</b> obscuring the contribution from the soot particles. To obtain pure soot particles I will have to filter more air so that the soot particles can be shaken off the filters and then analyzed by my new technique. ...|$|R
