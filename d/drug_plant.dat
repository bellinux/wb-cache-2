40|$|Background and Objectives: Herbal {{medicine}} {{as a type}} of {{complementary medicine}} has long been used by different societies. The studies of the last two decades have indicated the growing use of <b>drug</b> <b>plants</b> in the world, sometimes without consulting a physician and with no knowledge about their side-effects. This study was done with the aim of determining the status of use of <b>drug</b> <b>plants</b> and its related factors in Qom city. Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was done on 372 people of Qom city in 2012, using convenience sampling. The data were collected through a questionnaire that its validity and reliability had been confirmed. The data were analyzed via frequency tables, chi 2, Mann-Whitney and Fisher’s tests. Significance level was considered p< 0. 05. Results: In this study, 35. 48 % and 11. 55 % of participants had used <b>drug</b> <b>plants</b> for treatment and prevention, respectively. The most cases of consumption belonged to abdominal pain (48. 4 %), cold (42. 2 %) and sore throat (35. 8 %), and the most used plants were mint (72. 3 %), Sisymbrium irio (65. 1 %) and cinnamon (62. 9 %). The most important reason of use of <b>drug</b> <b>plants</b> were fewer side-effects (51. 1 %) and better results (39. 9 %) compared to chemical medicine. Among studied variables, a statistically significant relationship was observed between gender and the amount of using <b>drug</b> <b>plants</b> (p= 0. 01). Conclusion: Concerning the results of this study, the most reason of using <b>drug</b> <b>plants</b> was their fewer side-effects compared to chemical drugs. So, it is necessary to give accurate information, at the society level, about their side-effects and possible interactions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Drug {{policy in}} Thailand has {{relied heavily on}} law enforcement-based approaches. Qualitative reports {{indicate}} that police in Thailand have resorted to <b>planting</b> <b>drugs</b> on suspected drug users to extort money or provide grounds for arrest. The present study sought to describe the prevalence and factors associated with this form of evidence planting by police among injection drug users (IDU) in Bangkok. Methods Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with evidence <b>planting</b> of <b>drugs</b> by police among a community-based sample of IDU in Bangkok. We also examined the prevalence and average amount of money paid by IDU to police {{in order to avoid}} arrest. Results 252 IDU were recruited between July and August, 2008, among whom 66 (26. 2 %) were female and the median age was 36. 5 years. In total, 122 (48. 4 %) participants reported having <b>drugs</b> <b>planted</b> on them by police. In multivariate analyses, this form of evidence planting was positively associated with midazolam use (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 2. 84; 95 % Confidence Interval [CI]: 1. 58 - 5. 11), recent non-fatal overdose (AOR = 2. 56; 95 %CI: 1. 40 - 4. 66), syringe lending (AOR = 2. 08; 95 %CI: 1. 19 - 3. 66), and forced drug treatment (AOR = 1. 88; 95 %CI: 1. 05 - 3. 36). Among those who reported having <b>drugs</b> <b>planted</b> on them, 59 (48. 3 %) paid police a bribe in order to avoid arrest. Conclusion A high proportion of community-recruited IDU participating in this study reported having <b>drugs</b> <b>planted</b> on them by police. <b>Drug</b> <b>planting</b> was found to be associated with numerous risk factors including syringe sharing and participation in government-run drug treatment programs. Immediate action should be taken to address this form of abuse of power reportedly used by police. </p...|$|R
