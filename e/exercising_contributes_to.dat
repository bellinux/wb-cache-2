40|$|THESIS 8680 The {{link between}} dietary and {{lifestyle}} behaviours {{and the development}} of chronic diseases is well established. It is also widely acknowledged that obesity linked with insufficient <b>exercise</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> health problems and that, conversely, weight reducing diets may compromise dietary intake of key nutrients. It is often advocated that poor dietary and lifestyle practices should be tackled through education. One of the aims of the Irish Home Economics curriculum is to teach secondary school pupils about nutrition and lifestyle practices conducive to health. However, the lifestyle practices and attitudes of those teaching this subject in Ireland have never been examined...|$|R

40|$|Data were {{obtained}} from 300 men and women aged 55 to 91. Separate structural equation models of relationships between physical exercise and 3 cognitive performance variables—reaction time (RT), working memory, and reasoning—fit the data well. Other variables in the models were age, health, education, and morale. Age and exercise affected each performance variable directly; education had a direct effect on reasoning only. There were also indirect effects of age and health on performance variables, mediated through exercise. The main hypothesis of the study, that <b>exercise</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> performance, was supported. A large decrease in model fit resulted when the path from exercise to each variable was deleted.

While studies examining dietary improvement as a treatment strategy in depression are lacking, epidemiological evidence clearly points to diet quality being of importance to the risk of depression. Exercise {{has been shown to be}} an effective treatment strategy for depression, but this is not reflected in treatment guidelines, and increased physical activity is not routinely encouraged when managing depression in clinical practice. Recommendations regarding dietary improvement, increases in physical activity and smoking cessation should be routinely given to patients with depression.

30|$|Rights {{are seen}} as {{beneficial}} features which arose only in a social situation. A right is seen as dependent on the common good, {{in the sense that}} it is a power to act for one’s own good, secured to the individual by the community, “on the supposition that its <b>exercise</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> the good of the community”ah. Rights, like laws and institutions, are bound up with the realizations of individuals and their needs. “This foundation, in Green’s view, means that an individual exercising rights is intrinsically, or involuntarily, recognizing the common good. The capacity for rights in individuals is a social phenomenon; it can be guided and moralized through such institutions of society as the family. … unequal freedom of contract, unlicensed drink traffic, and insanitary homes, and going beyond Green’s stipulations, bad wages and fluctuations and seasonal employment, could affect the individual’s capacity for exercising rights.

50|$|Finally, {{geriatric}} rehabilitation {{has a large}} {{influence on}} the growing life expectancy around the globe. The American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) surveyed 556 adults over 65 years old {{in order to gain}} an understanding on the factors that affect adherence to an exercise program. Adherence to an exercise program influences frailty, speed, ability to live independently, and best of all, life expectancy. The study compared two factors: exercise barriers and motivation. The study concluded that exercise barriers play the largest role in determining adherence to a home exercise program (HEP). According to APTA, motivators include self-efficacy, the ability to control behavior, and outcome expectation, the belief that consequences follow certain actions. APTA describes barriers as: insufficient time, lack of social support, no place to exercise, limited finances, no transportation, and the fear of falling. Researchers recently found that depression, stress levels, increased age, decreased health status and lack of pleasure while <b>exercising</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> adherence.|$|R

A review of the {{existing}} literature indicated that physical <b>exercises</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> people’s well-being.

An empirical investigation was done by means of a mixed methods case study design. A purposive sample of 25 students was chosen from students in grades 9 to 11. The students completed an adapted Buss-Perry questionnaire on aggression to determine their levels of aggression. Thereafter they embarked on a 10 week physical exercise programme (30 sessions of 40 minutes each), before completing the same questionnaire. The results indicated that the programme alleviated their feelings of aggression, especially in the boys. Qualitative interviews with 10 of the participants who benefitted most from the exercises indicated how they experienced the programme.
