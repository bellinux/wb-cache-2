500|$|For [...] "The Asset", {{composer}} Bear McCreary wrote a {{theme for}} Ian Quinn. A [...] "bouncy and energetic" [...] {{version of this}} was performed on a bouzouki by guitarist Ed Trybek to evoke the music of Malta, while a simplified orchestral version is used as the primary Quinn theme. McCreary stated {{that he does not}} [...] "use it a lot, but it counts when <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> <b>When</b> he catches Skye in the hallways and steps forward menacingly, the low strings and woodwinds sneak in on this theme and underscore how dangerous he is." ...|$|E
500|$|Civil service {{reform was}} a {{prominent}} issue following Harrison's election. Harrison had campaigned as {{a supporter of the}} merit system, as opposed to the spoils system. Although some of the civil service had been classified under the Pendleton Act by previous administrations, Harrison spent much of his first months in office deciding on political appointments. Congress was widely divided on the issue and Harrison was reluctant to address the issue in hope of preventing the alienation of either side. The issue became a political football of the time and was immortalized in a cartoon captioned [...] "What can <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> both parties insist on kicking?" [...] Harrison appointed Theodore Roosevelt and Hugh Smith Thompson, both reformers, to the Civil Service Commission, but otherwise did little to further the reform cause.|$|E

2500|$|Another theory {{had claimed}} that the {{closures}} were intended to affect Sokolich's promotion of Hudson Lights, a $1 billion redevelopment project that was underway at the Fort Lee bridge access point. It has been noted that [...] "the Hudson Lights project is a billion-dollar project because it offers unparalleled access to the George Washington Bridge. But take away that access and it's no longer a billion-dollar project." [...] In a September 12, 2013, e-mail to Bill Baroni, during {{the time when the}} closure was still on-going, Mayor Sokolich raised concerns about the redevelopment project, asking [...] "What do <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> our billion-dollar development is put on line at the end of next year?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Kosmodemyanskaya {{joined the}} Komsomol in 1938. In October 1941, still {{a high school}} student in Moscow, she volunteered for a {{partisan}} unit. To her mother, who tried to dissuade her, she answered [...] "What can <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> the enemy is so close? If they came here I {{would not be able to}} continue living." [...] Zoya was assigned to the partisan unit 9903 (Staff of the Western Front). Of the one thousand people who joined the unit in October 1941 only half survived the war. At the village of Obukhovo near Naro-Fominsk, Kosmodemyanskaya and other partisans crossed the front line and entered territory occupied by the Germans. They mined roads and cut communication lines. On November 27, 1941 Zoya received an assignment to burn the village of Petrischevo, where a German cavalry regiment was stationed.|$|E

2500|$|An anecdote {{characteristic}} of rabbinical sympathy for inferiors and domestics is thus related: The wife of R. Jose had a quarrel with her maid, {{and her husband}} declared her in the wrong; whereupon she said to him, [...] "Wherefore didst thou declare me wrong {{in the presence of}} my maid?" [...] To which the rabbi replied, [...] "Did not Job (xxxi. 13) say, 'If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me, what then shall <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> God riseth up? And when He visiteth, what shall I answer Him?'" [...] (Gen. R. xlviii. 3). When Assi died, R. Hiya b. Abba, who had been his associate as judge and as teacher, went into mourning as for a relative (Yer. Ber. iii. 6a). The day of his death is recorded as coincident with a destructive hurricane (M. Ḳ. 26b).|$|E
2500|$|Founded in 1976, the Law School {{is named}} for Supreme Court Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo. Cardozo, {{who was born in}} 1870 in New York City, and was renowned for his integrity, social consciousness, and {{important}} opinions. Cardozo studied law at Columbia Law School from 1889–91 and subsequently rose to prominence during 23 years of private practice, becoming known as a lawyer’s lawyer before appointment to the New York State Court of Appeals in 1914. His tenure was marked by a number of original rulings, in tort and contract law in particular. This is partly due to timing; rapid industrialization was forcing courts to look anew at old common law components to adapt to new settings. He became the nation’s best-known and most admired state court judge. He added to his reputation through highly acclaimed off-the-bench writings, of which the most important is The Nature of the Judicial Process (1921). Shortly thereafter, Cardozo {{became a member of the}} group that founded the American Law Institute, which crafted a Restatement of the Law of Torts, Contracts, and a host of other private law subjects. He wrote three other books that also became standards in the legal world. By asking, and answering, the monumentally simple question, [...] "What is it that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> I decide a case?", he helped many see the judicial role with greater clarity. In 1932, President Herbert Hoover appointed Cardozo to succeed Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. on the Supreme Court. In his six years as an Associate Justice, he handed down opinions that stressed the necessity for the law to adapt to the realities and needs of modern life. The New York Times said of Cardozo's appointment that [...] "seldom, if ever, in the history of the Court has an appointment been so universally commended." [...] Democratic Cardozo's appointment by a Republican president has been referred to as one of the few Supreme Court appointments in history not motivated by partisanship or politics, but strictly based on the nominee's contribution to law.|$|E
