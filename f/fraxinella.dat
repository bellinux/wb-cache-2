60|$|There {{are other}} plants which have this {{property}} of exuding illuminating gas in very small quantities, but none, I believe, except the <b>Fraxinella,</b> will produce {{enough of it}} to allow this experiment to be performed.|$|E
60|$|But it is {{perfectly}} possible, as you may see in the engraving, to collect sufficient gas from the <b>Fraxinella</b> to produce combustion whenever desired. If the plant {{is surrounded by a}} glass case, the gas, as fast as produced, is confined in the case, and at last there is so much collected in this novel gasometer, that it is only necessary to open the case, and apply a match, to see plant-gas burning.|$|E
60|$|There is a plant, {{called by}} botanists the <b>Fraxinella,</b> {{which has the}} {{peculiar}} property of giving out, from its leaves and stalks, a gas which is inflammable. Sometimes, on a very still day, {{when there is no}} wind to blow it away as fast as it is produced, this gas may be ignited by a match, when the plant is growing in the open air. But this is very seldom the case, for the air must be very quiet, and the plant very productive, for enough gas to be found around it to ignite when a flame is applied.|$|E
6000|$|Humble and hive-bees {{are good}} botanists, for {{they know that}} {{varieties}} may differ widely in the colour of their flowers and yet {{belong to the same}} species. I have repeatedly seen humble-bees flying straight from a plant of the ordinary red Dictamnus <b>fraxinella</b> to a white variety; from one to another very differently coloured variety of Delphinium consolida and of Primula veris; from a dark purple to a bright yellow variety of Viola tricolor; and with two species of Papaver, from one variety to another which differed much in colour; but in this latter case some of the bees flew indifferently to either species, although passing by other genera, and thus acted as if the two species were merely varieties. Hermann Muller also has seen hive-bees flying from flower to flower of Ranunculus bulbosus and arvensis, and of Trifolium fragiferum and repens; and even from blue hyacinths to blue violets. (11/3. 'Bienen Zeitung' July 1876 page 183.) ...|$|E
60|$|Master Lambert was delighted, {{and led her}} out. There is no {{describing}} how refreshing was the sight to eyes after the bare, dry walls of the castle, and the tossing sea which the maiden had not yet learnt to love. Nor was the garden dull, though meant for use. There was a well in the centre with roses trained over it, roses of the dark old damask kind and the dainty musk, used to be distilled for the eyes, some flowers lingering still; there was the brown dittany or <b>fraxinella,</b> whose dried blossoms are phosphoric at night; delicate pink centaury, good for ague; purple mallows, good for wounds; leopard's bane with yellow blossoms; many and many more old and dear friends of Grisell, redolent of Wilton cloister and Sister Avice; and she ran {{from one to the}} other quite transported, and forgetful of all the dignities of the young Lady of Whitburn, while Lambert was delighted, and hoped she would come again when his lilies were in bloom.|$|E
60|$|With {{respect to}} the number of flowers which bees visit in a given time, I {{observed}} that in exactly one minute a humble-bee visited twenty-four of the closed flowers of the Linaria cymbalaria; another bee visited in the same time twenty-two flowers of the Symphoricarpus racemosa; and another seventeen flowers on two plants of a Delphinium. In the course of fifteen minutes a single flower on the summit of a plant of Oenothera was visited eight times by several humble-bees, and I followed the last of these bees, whilst it visited {{in the course of a}} few additional minutes every plant of the same species in a large flower-garden. In nineteen minutes every flower on a small plant of Nemophila insignis was visited twice. In one minute six flowers of a Campanula were entered by a pollen-collecting hive-bee; and bees when thus employed work slower than when sucking nectar. Lastly, seven flower-stalks on a plant of Dictamnus <b>fraxinella</b> were observed on the 15th of June 1841 during ten minutes; they were visited by thirteen humble-bees each of which entered many flowers. On the 22nd the same flower-stalks were visited within the same time by eleven humble-bees. This plant bore altogether 280 flowers, and from the above data, taking into consideration how late in the evening humble-bees work, each flower must have been visited at least thirty times daily, and the same flower keeps open during several days. The frequency of the visits of bees is also sometimes shown by the manner in which the petals are scratched by their hooked tarsi; I have seen large beds of Mimulus, Stachys, and Lathyrus with the beauty of their flowers thus sadly defaced.|$|E
60|$|The {{conspicuousness}} of the corolla {{does not}} suffice to induce repeated visits from insects, unless nectar {{is at the}} same time secreted, together perhaps with some odour emitted. I watched for a fortnight many times daily a wall covered with Linaria cymbalaria in full flower, and never saw a bee even looking at one. There was then a very hot day, and suddenly many bees were industriously at work on the flowers. It appears that a certain degree of heat is necessary for the secretion of nectar; for I observed with Lobelia erinus that if the sun ceased to shine for only half an hour, the visits of the bees slackened and soon ceased. An analogous fact with respect to the sweet excretion from the stipules of Vicia sativa has been already given. As in the case of the Linaria, so with Pedicularis sylvatica, Polygala vulgaris, Viola tricolor, and some species of Trifolium, I have watched the flowers day after day without seeing a bee at work, and then suddenly all the flowers were visited by many bees. Now how did so many bees discover at once that the flowers were secreting nectar? I presume that it must have been by their odour; and that as soon as a few bees began to suck the flowers, others of the same and of different kinds observed the fact and profited by it. We shall presently see, when we treat of the perforation of the corolla, that bees are fully capable of profiting by the labour of other species. Memory also comes into play, for, as already remarked, bees know the position of each clump of flowers in a garden. I have repeatedly seen them passing round a corner, but otherwise in as straight a line as possible, from one plant of <b>Fraxinella</b> and of Linaria to another and distant one of the same species; although, owing to the intervention of other plants, the two were not in sight of each other.|$|E
60|$|Two {{plants of}} each form were {{protected}} from the access of insects during two successive years, and in the autumn they yielded very few capsules and presented a remarkable contrast with the adjoining uncovered plants, which were densely covered with capsules. In 1863 a protected long-styled plant produced only five poor capsules; two mid-styled plants produced together the same number; and two short-styled plants only a single one. These capsules contained very few seeds; yet the plants were fully productive when artificially fertilised under the net. In a state of nature the flowers are incessantly visited for their nectar by hive- and other bees, various Diptera and Lepidoptera. (4/3. H. Muller gives {{a list of the}} species 'Die Befruchtung der Blumen' page 196. It appears that one bee, the Cilissa melanura, almost confines its visits to this plant.) The nectar is secreted all round the base of the ovarium; but a passage is formed along the upper and inner side of the flower by the lateral deflection (not represented in the diagram) of the basal portions of the filaments; so that insects invariably alight on the projecting stamens and pistil, and insert their proboscides along the upper and inner margin of the corolla. We can now see why the ends of the stamens with their anthers, and the ends of the pistils with their stigmas, are a little upturned, so that they may be brushed by the lower hairy surfaces of the insects' bodies. The shortest stamens which lie enclosed within the calyx of the long- and mid-styled forms can be touched only by the proboscis and narrow chin of a bee; hence they have their ends more upturned, and they are graduated in length, so as to fall into a narrow file, sure to be raked by the thin intruding proboscis. The anthers of the longer stamens stand laterally farther apart and are more nearly on the same level, for they have to brush against the whole breadth of the insect's body. In very many other flowers the pistil, or the stamens, or both, are rectangularly bent {{to one side of the}} flower. This bending may be permanent, as with Lythrum and many others, or may be effected, as in Dictamnus <b>fraxinella</b> and others, by a temporary movement, which occurs in the case of the stamens when the anthers dehisce, and in the case of the pistil when the stigma is mature; but these two movements do not always take place simultaneously in the same flower. Now I have found no exception to the rule, that when the stamens and pistil are bent, they bend to that side of the flower which secretes nectar, even though there be a rudimentary nectary of large size on the opposite side, as in some species of Corydalis. When nectar is secreted on all sides, they bend to that side where the structure of the flower allows the easiest access to it, as in Lythrum, various Papilionaceae, and others. The rule consequently is, that when the pistils and stamens are curved or bent, the stigma and anthers are thus brought into the pathway leading to the nectary. There are a few cases which seem to be exceptions to this rule, but they are not so in truth; for instance, in the Gloriosa lily, the stigma of the grotesque and rectangularly bent pistil is brought, not into any pathway from the outside towards the nectar-secreting recesses of the flower, but into the circular route which insects follow in proceeding from one nectary to the other. In Scrophularia aquatica the pistil is bent downwards from the mouth of the corolla, but it thus strikes the pollen-dusted breast of the wasps which habitually visit these ill-scented flowers. In all these cases we see the supreme dominating power of insects on the structure of flowers, especially of those which have irregular corollas. Flowers which are fertilised by the wind must of course be excepted; but I do not know of a single instance of an irregular flower which is thus fertilised.|$|E

50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 14-18 mm. Adults are on wing from May to June {{and again}} in August in two generations depending on the location.The larvae feed on Fraxinus excelsior and Fraxinus ornus. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine consists of an irregular small corridor with dispersed black frass. Often the corridor widens in the end into an irregular blotch with much less frass. The mine may begin at an egg shell, but the larvae can leave their mine and start a new one elsewhere in the leaf. In the latter case the corridor begins with a small round opening. Before the leaf is shed the larva leaves the mine and bores into the bark, where it hibernates. After hibernation they live as shoot borer or free among spun leaves.Prays <b>fraxinella</b> has two colour forms, the typical white and black colouration and the melanic form f.rustica.|$|E
