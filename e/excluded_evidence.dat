5000|$|Carome {{pointed to}} cases where {{this had been}} done. In Thiel v. Southern Pacific Corp., and Ballard v.

50|$|Bonds's {{trial was}} set for March 2, 2009, but delayed by appeals, after the judge {{excluded}} drugs tests and other evidence {{that could not be}} specifically tied to Bonds without the testimony of Greg Anderson, who is alleged to have provided steroids to Barry Bonds when he was Bonds personal trainer and linked to Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO). Law professor Peter Keane called the prosecutors' move a blunder, although an account by another published attorney disagreed. In June 2010, however, the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the evidence should be excluded. On August 7, 2010, it was reported that U.S. District Judge Susan Illston of San Francisco had rescheduled the trial for March 21, 2011. On Friday, December 17, 2010, it was reported that attorneys for Bonds, citing the appeals court ruling, filed papers asking the judge to forbid testimony of current and former baseball players linked to BALCO or the steroids scandal, and not to permit use of Anderson's drug ledgers and calendars, as well as other documents from BALCO which the prosecution was seeking to use at the trial in spite of the appeals court ruling.On January 10, 2011, lawyers for Bonds filed additional papers asking the judge not to permit use of Anderson as a witness by the prosecution (since, given his previous unwillingness to testify, it was presumed he would again decline), nor to allow prosecutors to tell the jury about any refusal of Anderson to testify, nor permit use of a reported tape of Anderson talking to Steve Hoskins, previously a business manager of Bonds.The judge had already <b>excluded</b> <b>evidence</b> which could not be connected to Bonds because of Anderson's refusal to testify about his alleged knowledge of Bonds' alleged connection to the evidence.

40|$|The {{results of}} Ultimatum Game {{experiments}} are often quoted as {{evidence for the}} role of fairness in bargaining or in economic behaviour more generally. This paper argues that the observed fairness levels are contingent on the traditional experimental design where players are newly matched each round, and reputations are therefore <b>excluded.</b> <b>Evidence</b> from a new experiment shows that average behaviour is more competitive and conflict rates are higher when subjects play against the same opponent repeatedly. This finding is not expected by the traditional fairness hypothesis. A detailed analysis of the dynamics of pairs of players shows that different types of players coexist in the subject pool. Whereas previous experiments found evidence for the existence of "fair" players, the present study reports also a significant number of "tough" players. Hence, there is evidence that allowing for reputations in repeated ultimatum bargaining induces different patterns of behaviour that have not been observed before in this game. game theory, experiments, learning, fairness, reputations, ultimatum game...|$|E

Science 292, 1888 – 1892] concluded that the extinction of Australia's late Pleistocene megafauna was an abrupt event that took place about 46 ka ago throughout the continent. By placing the extinctions soon after the arrival of people in Australia but before climate changes associated with the Last Glacial Maximum, this study implicated human impact as cause. However, the study was controversial because it <b>excluded</b> <b>evidence,</b> mainly from archaeological sites containing disarticulated megafauna remains, for survival of some megafauna well past 46 ka ago. Here, I ask how our interpretation of the extinctions would be changed if this evidence were accepted. Contrary to climate-change models of extinction, the young megafauna sites are not concentrated in mesic refuges around the coast. These sites do suggest that relatively small-bodied megafauna species were the last to disappear, as predicted by {{a version of the}} overkill hypothesis. More work is needed to test the evidence for late survival of megafauna species in Australia, but at present this evidence supports overkill, not climate change, as the cause of the extinctions...|$|E

40|$|Background: Subcutaneous {{terbutaline}} (SQ terbutaline) infusion by pump {{is used in}} {{pregnant women}} as a prolonged (beyond 48 – 72 h) maintenance tocolytic following acute treatment of preterm contractions. The effectiveness and safety of this maintenance tocolysis have not been clearly established. We aimed to systematically evaluate the effectiveness and safety of subcutaneous (SQ) terbutaline infusion by pump for maintenance tocolysis. Methodology/Principal Findings: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases, post-marketing surveillance data and grey literature were searched up to April 2011 for relevant experimental and observational studies. Two randomized trials, one nonrandomized trial, and 11 observational studies met inclusion criteria. Non-comparative studies were considered only for pump-related harms. We excluded case-reports but sought FDA summaries of post-marketing surveillance data. Non-English records without an English abstract were <b>excluded.</b> <b>Evidence</b> of low strength from observational studies with risk of bias favored SQ terbutaline pump for the outcomes of delivery at, 32 and, 37 weeks, mean days of pregnancy prolongation, and neonatal death. Observational studies of medium to high risk of bias also demonstrated benefit for other surrogate outcomes, such as birthweight and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission.

40|$|Context: This review {{focuses on}} the {{prevention}} and management of complications following radical cystectomy (RC) for bladder cancer (BCa). Objective: We review the current literature and perform {{an analysis of the}} frequency, treatment, and prevention of complications related to RC for BCa. Evidence acquisition: A Medline search was conducted to identify original articles, reviews, and editorials addressing the relationship between RC and short- and long-term complications. Series examined were published within the past decade. Large series reported on multiple occasions (Lee [1], Meyer [2], and Chang and Cookson [3]) with the same cohorts are recorded only once. Quality of life (QoL) and sexual function were <b>excluded.</b> <b>Evidence</b> synthesis: The literature regarding prophylaxis, prevention, and treatment of complications of RC in general is retrospective, not standardised. In general, it is of poor quality when it comes to evidence and is thus difficult to synthesise. Conclusions: Progress has been made in reducing mortality and preventing complications of RC. Postoperative morbidity remains high, partly because of the complexity of the procedures. The issues of surgical volume and standardised prospective reporting of RC morbidity to create evidence-based guidelines are essential for further reducing morbidity and improving patients' QoL.

40|$|Subprime credit, a {{relatively}} new method of risk-based pricing, has been hailed {{as a way to}} open up markets and provide access to credit to those who would otherwise be <b>excluded.</b> <b>Evidence</b> suggests that subprime mortgage segmentation increases rather than reduces exclusionary practices in lending. Furthermore, what is unclear is how lenders determine who qualifies as a subprime borrower. This concern became manifested when studies demonstrated that minority borrowers, regardless of creditworthiness, are more likely to receive expensive, sub-prime loans. The disparity is properly attributed to lenders’ credit pricing policies which included discretionary increases despite the objectively-determined risk-based interest rate as well as minority borrowers’ search costs and asymmetric information about prices in this market. This Article reviews the theory and history of credit scoring in mortgage lending and argues that lenders’ practices arguably justified by 2 ̆ 2 legitimate business need 2 ̆ 2 as well as lenders’ credit scoring models exacerbate lending disparities. It argues that the failure of competitive forces to disallow these unjustified and illegal increases also speaks to regulatory failure. It proposes that lenders operating in noncompetitive subprime mortgage markets address how their practices interact with lending disparities even apart from their complicity in creating conditions that worsen economic disadvantage...|$|E
