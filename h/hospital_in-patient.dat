50|$|Berkson's {{original}} illustration {{involves a}} retrospective study examining {{a risk factor}} for a disease in a statistical sample from a <b>hospital</b> <b>in-patient</b> population. Because samples are taken from a <b>hospital</b> <b>in-patient</b> population, rather than from the general public, this can result in a spurious negative association between the disease and the risk factor. For example, if the risk factor is diabetes and the disease is cholecystitis, a hospital patient without diabetes is more likely to have cholecystitis than a member of the general population, since the patient must have had some non-diabetes (possibly cholecystitis-causing) reason to enter the hospital in the first place. That result will be obtained regardless of whether there is any association between diabetes and cholecystitis in the general population.|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The biological need for lighting by an individual differs from the merely visual purpose, such as viewing objects and doing work or movement. Lack of adequate daylight for biological stimulation can lead to health problems, for e. g. imbalanced circadian rhythm. The importance of daylight is vital for hospital patients who are mostly physically and/or psychologically stressed. As, many patients stay indoors for 24 hours, they might be vulnerable {{to the lack of}} daylight which is necessary for health reasons. Hence, for hospital patients, daylight can be a strong therapeutic environmental design element to ensure good health and accelerate clinical recovery. The complex relationship between daylight environment and individuals responses are not fully understood. Controversy results that are debated by the previous researchers, has made the implementation of daylighting strategies in the architectural design of <b>hospital</b> <b>in-patient</b> rooms critical, mainly for therapeutic purpose. Strong evidence needs to be established that can build confidence to both architects and policy makers to use daylight for therapeutic purpose and integration of therapeutic effect of daylight to in-patient room architecture is necessary as well. This thesis provides information to architects (with examples) for incorporation of therapeutic effect of daylight in the design of in-patient rooms to reduce patient length of stay (LoS) in hospitals. A triangulation research method was applied in this work, where theories were developed qualitatively and tested quantitatively. Literature review was carried out to establish the potential effect of daylight on patient health. Retrospective field investigations were conducted to establish the quantitative relationship between daylight intensity and patient LoS inside in-patient rooms by developing Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models under a general hospital environment. Using the daylighting goal to enhance therapeutic benefit for hospital patients, referred from literature and verified from field investigation data, a daylight design concept (sky window configurations) was developed and evaluated by prospective simulation study, and found better compared to traditional standard hospital window configurations, in order to enhance therapeutic benefit for hospital patients. A dynamic annual Climate-Based Daylight Modelling (CBDM) method that uses RADIANCE (backward) raytracer combined with a daylight coefficient approach considering Perez all weather sky luminance model (i. e. DAYSIM), was used for simulation analysis. This thesis develops strategies for architects to incorporate therapeutic effect of daylight in the architectural design of <b>hospital</b> <b>in-patient</b> rooms, including guidelines to support architectural decisions in case of conflicting situations, and to identify the range of daylight intensities within which patient LoS is expected to be reduced. The strategies also consider the ultraviolet radiation (UVR) protections and discuss the challenges of climate change for daylight researchers for the incorporation of therapeutic effect of daylight in the design of <b>hospital</b> <b>in-patient</b> rooms. The thesis provides a contribution to knowledge by establishing strong evidence of quantitative relationship between daylight and LoS, and by presenting new architectural forms for <b>hospital</b> <b>in-patient</b> room design as one of the possible ways to incorporate therapeutic effect of daylight in the design of <b>hospital</b> <b>in-patient</b> rooms effectively. It is expected that the research will encourage and help architects and policy makers to incorporate therapeutic effect of daylight in the design of <b>hospital</b> <b>in-patient</b> rooms, efficiently...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Peripheral venous {{thrombophlebitis}} (PVT) {{represents a}} considerable source of iatrogenic morbidity, occurring in about 20 % of <b>hospital</b> <b>in-patients.</b> The {{aim of this}} prospective randomised {{study was to investigate}} the effect of elective change of intravenous cannulae on the incidence of PVT in <b>hospital</b> <b>in-patients.</b> PATIENTS AND METHODS: General medical and surgical inpatients requiring intravenous therapy were randomised into control (n = 26) or study (n = 21) groups. Cannulae in the control group were only removed if the site became painful, the cannula dislodged, or there were signs of PVT. Cannulae in the study group were changed electively every 48 h. All patients were examined daily for signs of PVT. RESULTS: Peripheral venous thrombophlebitis developed in 11 / 26 patients in the control group and 1 / 21 patients in the study group (P = 0. 003). Elective change of cannulae did not significantly increase the total number of cannulae sited (41 cannulae in the control group versus 43 in the study group). CONCLUSIONS: Elective change of cannulae resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of infusion phlebitis. The authors recommend that elective re-siting of intravenous cannulae becomes standard practice for all patients requiring intravenous therapy...|$|R

40|$|In many {{developed}} countries the problem of allocating resources within the Health Care System (HCS) is perennial. Health Care administrators are continually asking {{what are the consequences}} of changing the mix of resources. The disaggregated resource allocation model (DRAM) has been developed to assist Health Care administrators with this problem. The model simulates how the HCS in aggregate allocates limited supplies of resources between competing demands. The principal outputs of the model are the numbers of patients treated in different categories, and the modes and quotas of treatment they receive. This paper describes how parameters were estimated for DRAM for Czechoslovakian <b>hospital</b> <b>in-patient</b> care. The model was parameterized for seven patient categories (general surgery, general medicine, obstetrics and gynaecology, traumatic and orthopaedic surgery, otorhinolaryngology, paediatrics, and ophthalmology) and two resource types (hospital beds and hospital doctors).

AIMS: To identify risk factors for suicide in psychiatric <b>hospital</b> <b>in-patients</b> and to evaluate their predictive power in detecting people at risk of suicide. METHOD: Using a case-control design, 112 people who committed suicide while <b>in-patients</b> in psychiatric <b>hospitals</b> were compared with 112 randomly selected controls. Univariate analysis and multivariate analyses were used to estimate odds ratios and adjusted likelihood ratios. RESULTS: The rate of suicide in psychiatric in-patients was 13. 7 (95 % CI 11. 7 - 16. 1) per 10, 000 admissions. There were five predictive factors with likelihood ratios > 2, following adjustment: planned suicide attempt, 4. 1; actual suicide attempt, 4. 9; recent bereavement, 4. 0; presence of delusions, 2. 3; chronic mental illness, 2. 2; and family history of suicide, 4. 6. On this basis, only two of the patients who committed suicide had a predicted risk of suicide above 5 %.
