In 2013, the German Air Force deactivated its presence at Fort Bliss, while retaining a presence at Holloman Air Force Base; {{over the previous}} 47 years, over 50,000 German Airmen received training at this command. In 2015, due to funding constraints on the planned new facilities in Europe, the German Air Force Air Defense school will stay open at Fort Bliss until 2020.|$|E
25|$|The Tuileries Palace, {{city hall}} of Paris, {{and many other}} public {{buildings}} had been burned by the Commune or damaged in the fighting, but the Odéon was still intact. Charles-Marie Chilly, the co-director of the Odéon, came to her apartment, where Bernhardt received him reclining on a sofa. He announced that the theater would reopen in October 1871, and {{he asked her to}} play the lead in a new play, Jean-Marie by André Theuriet. Bernhardt replied that she was finished with the theater and was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> Brittany and start a farm. Chilly, who knew Bernhardt's moods well, told her that he understood and accepted her decision, and would give the role to Jane Essler, a rival actress. According to Chilly, Bernhardt immediately jumped up from the sofa and asked when the rehearsals would begin.|$|E

The Teas Nursery business was either <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> a new location or be liquidated. In December the Rubenstein family bought the Teas property; the family planned to donate it to the City of Bellaire for community purposes. The Teas property has two historic buildings. Scott Rubenstein, who handled negotiations for the Rubenstein family, described the Teas lot as [...] "the last largely undeveloped tract in the city and, frankly, in the inner loop {{of the city of}} Houston where you can do something that can be used by people from all around the city." [...] Mayor of Bellaire Cindy Seigel said [...] "I am just thrilled we’ll be able to preserve a historical property that is an important piece of Bellaire’s history." ...|$|E

500|$|Shooting in Panama City {{began on}} 7 February 2008 at Howard Air Force Base. The country doubled for Haiti and Bolivia, with the National Institute of Culture of Panama {{standing}} {{in for a}} hotel in the latter country. A sequence requiring several hundred extras was also shot at nearby Colón. Shooting in Panama was also carried out at Fort Sherman, a former US military base on the Colón coast. Forster was disappointed he could only shoot the boat chase in that harbour, as he had a more spectacular vision for the scene. Officials in the country worked with the locals to [...] "minimise inconvenience" [...] for the cast and crew, and in return hoped the city's exposure in the film would increase tourism. The crew was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> Cusco, Peru for ten days of filming on 2 March, but the location was cancelled for budget reasons. Twelve days of filming in Chile began on 24 March at Antofagasta. There was shooting in Cobija, the Paranal Observatory, and other locations in the Atacama Desert. Forster chose the desert and the observatory's ESO Hotel to represent Bond's rigid emotions, and being {{on the verge of}} committing a vengeful act as he confronts Greene in the film's climax.|$|E
2500|$|Interest in the Patriots grew both {{during and}} after the 1993 season, despite their lackluster on-field showing. By many measures, the Patriots were as popular as they had ever been – even more popular than they had been during their 1985 Super Bowl year. Despite this interest, however, rumors abounded that the team was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> St. Louis as soon as James Orthwein could clear all the hurdles. [...] Finally, in the 1993 off-season, the issue reached its climax. Orthwein offered Robert Kraft, the team's {{landlord}} since 1988, $75 million to break the operating covenant of the lease, which would then free him to move the Patriots to St. Louis. [...] Kraft refused, which continued to bind the Patriots to playing at Foxboro. When it became apparent that Kraft would not allow Orthwein to buy out the lease, Orthwein put the team up for sale. Kraft bought the team for a then-NFL record $175 million in 1994, beating out an investor group which included Paul Newman and Walter Payton as investors (the latter of which was on the Chicago Bears team that beat the Patriots in Super Bowl XX). On February 26, 1994, Kraft's first full day as owner of the Patriots, the team sold 5,958 season tickets, shattering by over sixfold the team's prior single-day record of 979. Moreover, soon after Kraft took full ownership, the Patriots sold out the entire 1994 season—the first time in team history that had happened. [...] Every Patriots home game—preseason, regular season, and playoffs—has been sold out ever since.|$|E

6000|$|Thus matters stood, the confederates turning anxious eyes towards Venice, and, haply, {{beginning}} to wonder whether the Republic was indeed <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> their support as they had so confidently expected, and realizing perhaps by now their rashness, and the ruin that awaited them should Venice fail them.
