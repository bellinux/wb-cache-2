ECV is used in external variable displacement swash plate type compressor and controls the entire air conditioning system {{by means of a}} pulse width modulation (PWM) input signal supplying from an external source (controller). Complete form of ECV contains number of internal features like valve body, core, valve guide, plunger, guide pin, plunger spring, bellows etc. While designing the ECV; dimensions of different internal items must meet the standard requirements as it is quite challenging. In this research paper, especially the dimensioning of ECV body and its three pressure ports through which the air/refrigerant passes are considered. Here <b>internal</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>test</b> analysis of ECV body is being carried out from its discharge port (Pd) to crankcase port (Pc) when the guide valve is placed inside it.

2500|$|The {{accident}} investigation board published a preliminary report on 14 September 2005, in which they ruled out most possibilities of physical damage before the helicopter hit water, including sabotage and collision with a flock of birds.

40|$|This Master`s Thesis {{deal with}} {{integrity}} and barrier philosophy. A special {{focus has been}} on <b>internal</b> <b>leakage</b> through barrier elements. There is an increasing discussion about what a primary and secondary barrier is, how many barriers there should be, their permitted <b>internal</b> <b>leakage</b> acceptance criteria and their integrity. Subsea Christmas tree (XMT) is considered as a pressure barrier element in subsea production systems. Rules and regulations require frequent <b>leakage</b> <b>testing</b> of subsea XMT valves. Applicable standards include NORSOK D- 010, ISO 10423 and 13628 - 4 and API RP 14 B. Due to the remoteness, of the subsea well head, testing is more complicated compared to testing of platform trees (dry trees). Applicable standards specify a maximum permitted leakage rate. However, when considering testing of valves using small fluid test volume the model has limitations. A challenge is to determine if the <b>leakage</b> <b>test</b> criteria are fulfilled or not. Leak testing of subsea XMT valves is an engineering challenge. Engineers must meet leak rate standards as well as they have to understand all aspects of the leak testing procedure. Operators address a {{question of whether or not}} their correlation tool of pressure to leak rate is accurate enough. Another question regards the permitted <b>internal</b> <b>leakage</b> acceptance criteria governed by API RP 14 B; how to apply the leakage criteria to small test volumes – typical XMT volumes. By this Master`s Thesis, an issue that does not have an ideal solution today is highlighted. The issue that operating companies faces is: In questionable situations whether a valve has fulfilled the criteria or not – how to apply the leakage criteria to small test volumes, how to decide whether a XMT have to be pulled, how to increase planning security, how to save money, time and estimate the lifetime of different valves on the XMT. The problems that the Operating Company meet regarding <b>leakage</b> <b>testing</b> of XMT valves may be that the differential pressure across the valve is lost in a couple of minutes. This questions the leak test procedure; is the permitted leak rate acceptance criteria or the test interval too large? To be on the safe side when evaluating <b>leakage</b> <b>tests,</b> the Operating Company has included new permitted <b>internal</b> <b>leakage</b> acceptance criteria into their work procedures. Service personnel fear that such a strict acceptance criteria can result in an unmanageable situation with a numerous of exceptions. Another problem that may be faced is that there is no procedure of when to initiate the <b>leakage</b> <b>test.</b> This results in difficulties in comparing historical and recent <b>leakage</b> <b>tests.</b> Also, this can result in a <b>leakage</b> <b>test</b> that shows a smaller leakage than it actually do. Data from previous <b>leakage</b> <b>tests</b> of production Master – and –Wing valve on the XMT are collected. The data are used to evaluate today`s procedure of <b>leakage</b> <b>testing</b> and for correlating pressure to leak rate. Both, the new <b>internal</b> <b>leakage</b> acceptance criteria that the Operating Company uses and the permitted <b>internal</b> <b>leakage</b> acceptance criteria governed by API RP 14 B are evaluated. Today, a basic tool for correlating pressure to acceptable leak rate exists. From the technical advisors point of view it is desirable with a more accurate software tool that can correlate pressure to leak rate. To evaluate today`s practice of correlating pressure to leak rate the MultiProScale simulation tool is used. It is assumed that the simulation tool correlates the most correct leak rate due to the complexity of the simulation tool. However, this Master`s Thesis shows that such a powerful tool is not needed for correlating pressure to leak rate. Based on this Master`s Thesis, the contribution to the <b>leakage</b> <b>testing</b> procedure is an improved calculation tool of correlating pressure, temperature and compressibility changes to actual leak rate. A presentation of this Master`s Thesis is presented for the Technical advisor of Well Technology, Hilde Brandanger Haga at Statoil. She agreed with the challenges and solutions that were presented. The improved calculation tool was also introduced. A proposal was presented that not only could the calculation tool be used onshore, but it could be used to show the actual leak rate during <b>leakage</b> <b>testing</b> of the PMV and PWV offshore. The advantage with this tool is that it can ensure the competence, it helps the decision-making process, it increases planning, it decreases cost and safeguard barriers. Other contributions are recommended changes both to the leak testing procedure and the data documentation. In relation to both of the permitted <b>internal</b> <b>leakage</b> acceptance criteria, the main conclusions are: To apply the <b>internal</b> <b>leakage</b> acceptance criteria governed by API 14 B to the subsea XMT, the leakage time interval have to be reduced from 10 – to 2 minutes. This will not result in an increased number of valves that does not fulfill the acceptance criteria. Or to apply the acceptance criteria governed by API RP 14 B, the test volume has to be > 50 liters. And, the additional <b>internal</b> <b>leakage</b> acceptance criteria that are implemented by the Operating Company are stricter than the one governed by API RP 14 B. A decrease in time interval from 10 – to 2 minutes gives an increased number of valves that do not fulfill the permitted <b>internal</b> <b>leakage</b> acceptance criteria. </p...|$|R

In some applications {{it is interesting to}} observe their performances beyond these conditions, for example {{in the case of a}} high temperature two-stage heat pump or of a cooling system working at high temperature. In this study a compressor is characterized experimentally with refrigerant R 134 a and through 118 tests at condensing pressures varying from 8. 6 up to 40. 4 bar (tsat = 33. 9 °C to tsat = 100. 8 °C) and evaporating pressures varying from 1. 6 up to 17. 8 bar (tsat = - 15. 6 °C to tsat = 62. 4 °C). Under these conditions the compressor motor was pushed at its maximal current in several tests. This compressor’s performance is mainly characterized by its isentropic and volumetric efficiencies. It presents a maximal isentropic efficiency of 72 %, corresponding to a pressure ratio of around 2. 5 – 2. 6. The volumetric efficiency decreases linearly from almost 1. 0 (for a pressure ratio of 1. 3) to 0. 83 (for a pressure ratio of 9. 7). A slight degradation of the isentropic and volumetric efficiencies is observed when the compressor supply and exhaust pressures are increased for a given pressure ratio; this could be due to an <b>internal</b> <b>leakage.</b> The compressor <b>tests</b> are used to identify the six parameters of a semi-empirical simulation model.

40|$|The {{integration}} of <b>internal</b> <b>leakage</b> fault detection and tolerant control for single-rod hydraulic actuators {{is present in}} this paper. Fault detection is a potential technique to provide efficient condition monitoring and/or preventive maintenance, and fault tolerant control is a critical method to improve the safety and reliability of hydraulic servo systems. Based on quadratic Lyapunov functions, a performance-oriented fault detection method is proposed, which has a simple structure and is prone to implement in practice. The main feature is that, when a prescribed performance index is satisfied (even a slight fault has occurred), there is no fault alarmed; otherwise (i. e., a severe fault has occurred), the fault is detected and then a fault tolerant controller is activated. The proposed tolerant controller, {{which is based on}} the parameter adaptive methodology, is also prone to realize, and the learning mechanism is simple since only the <b>internal</b> <b>leakage</b> is considered in parameter adaptation and thus the persistent exciting (PE) condition is easily satisfied.

40|$|<b>Internal</b> <b>leakages</b> of high {{pressure}} and temperature steam valves {{have been identified}} as a potential contributor to a loss in power generating plant efficiency. These losses are often neglected due to it being difficult to detect problematic valves and quantify the <b>internal</b> <b>leakages</b> through them. A non-intrusive NOT technique that detects and quantifies <b>internal</b> <b>leakages</b> through valves will be a very favourable tool to any power generating plant as it will allow for the early detection of <b>internal</b> <b>leakages</b> and could possibly provide considerable financial savings. This research evaluates different monitoring techniques suitable for detecting and quantifying <b>internal</b> <b>leakages</b> through valves and selects a technique that is most suitable for application in a power generating plant environment. The proposed technique utilises infra-red thermography to calculate pipe surface temperatures on a length of un-insulated pipe located downstream of a valve that is leaking internally. As the leakage steam flows through the length of un-insulated pipe, it will lose a portion of its heat energy through the pipe wall to the surrounding environment. This will result in a drop in temperature of the steam from the upstream to downstream points of the un-insulated length of pipe. By calculating the heat loss and the drop in temperature of the leakage steam, a mass flow rate of the leakage steam can be determined. A mathematical model was derived which with inputs of upstream and downstream pipe surface temperatures of the un-insulated pipe, pipe properties and ambient air conditions, calculates the heat loss, the temperature drop and the resulting mass flow rate of the leakage flow through the valve. A detailed experimental study was conducted to validate the proposed technique in determining <b>internal</b> <b>leakages</b> thought steam valves. Steam generated from a mini steam generating plant was allowed to flow through an experimental test rig, which contained a length of un-insulated pipe, at different flow rates. Pipe surface temperature measurements of the un-insulated pipe were made using an infrared thermal camera and a mass flow rate of the steam was calculated using the derived mathematical model. In all experiments, the mass flow rate calculated using the mathematical model was compared to a mass flow rate acquired from a flow measuring device installed in-line with the experimental test rig. The results indicate that an increase in mass flow rate causes an increase in pipe surface temperatures of the un-insulated pipe which translates to an increase in heat loss of the leakage steam through the length of un-insulated pipe. The mass flow rate calculated using the proposed technique closely approximates the mass flow rate acquired from the flow measuring device. This indicates that the proposed technique, using infrared thermography, is capable of detecting and quantifying possible <b>internal</b> valve <b>leakages</b> encountered in online operation. Onsite tests were performed using the proposed technique on two different boiler drain valves at Majuba Power Station. It was found that one of the valves was internally leaking steam to the atmosphere at a rate of 0. 039 kg/s whilst the other valve was sealing correctly. A comprehensive financial impact study was conducted, and it was found that this leakage steam will result in a total loss of R 730 108 per annum if the leak is left unattended. This is the loss for a single valve that has a relatively small leak. The financial loss for a combination of all valves that are internally leaking in a power plant could be substantial and can clearly justify plant personnel in utilising the proposed technique to identify problematic valves. With its portability, non-intrusiveness and ease of use the proposed technique provides a cost-effective means to determine <b>internal</b> <b>leakages</b> through power plant valves...|$|R
