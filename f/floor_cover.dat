5000|$|Installing and {{deploying}} large covers can be labour-intensive task. The {{most efficient}} way involves rolling and unrolling each section separately, and storing them on the gym <b>floor</b> <b>cover</b> storage system (rack) in a rolled up state to prevent creases and static dust accumulation. Advances in the newer Protex GymPro products allow for smaller storage racks while the newer tile systems are stacked on compact platform trucks for storage and transport. Dual cleaning brush assemblies (to remove debris) and electric power winders (to reduce manual labor during cover removal) are normally used to efficiently maintain the covers while the carpet based gym covers are best cleaned using the Host Cleaning method with the covers still in place.|$|E

This is intertwined with footage of people in large costumes similar to the puppets who are harassing a woman outside. A man is also shown observing through a window in the building before removing a <b>floor</b> <b>cover</b> and heading below. The boy closes the tent and runs away as the video ends.|$|E
50|$|The first plastic tarp gym <b>floor</b> <b>cover</b> {{was invented}} and {{manufactured}} by Covermaster Inc. in 1969 with Seattle-based Floor Guardian Inc. following up by manufacturing a recycled content, removable, portable carpet based protection {{system in the}} late 1970s to answer the demand for a product that was less of a trip hazard, environmentally sound and classier looking than what many felt was basically a painter's tarp. Since then {{the quality of the}} materials has greatly evolved. Most manufacturers have switched from vinyl and polyethylene materials to more durable polyester fabric. In 2013, Protex Matting Inc. answered environmental concerns by introducing the newest 100% recycled polyester top cloth gym floor covers made completely from recycled plastic water bottles, saving approximately 7000 water bottles for every 10,000 sq. ft produced. The best plastic tarp gym floor covers today are made of single-layer woven polyester and the newest polymer materials with utilization of the knife-coating process, which enables dyes to be deposited deep into the core of the PVC. material and prevent peeling of the layers - a side effect of extrusion coating or lamination process..|$|E

50|$|The CSL {{also had}} various {{aesthetic}} modifications over the standard M3. It received an aerodynamic lightweight body kit which included carbon fibre front splitters that improved down force {{at high speeds}} by 50%, {{as well as a}} carbon fibre rear diffuser. The front bumper had a distinct hole that is used to draw cool air into the newly designed air intake. The trunk <b>floor</b> <b>cover</b> was made of lightweight fibre-board (not cardboard as infamously described by BBC Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson). The trunk lid was redesigned to incorporate a raised lip, unlike the standard M3 where one is simply added onto a flat trunk. The CSL was sold with distinct 19-inch lightweight cast BBS alloy rims that came with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup semi-slick racing tyres. The interior of the CSL is redesigned with a sporty weight-saving theme. The CSL obtains fibreglass front racing bucket seats, and fibreglass backed rear seats. The center console, door panels and trim, and head-liner are all formed from carbon fibre, and the steering wheel is redesigned with cruise control, stereo, and phone controls removed to include just a single button that activates the M track mode.|$|E

40|$|Like {{many other}} fruits, table grapes depend on {{accurate}} temperature management during transport in maritime refrigerated containers. Ideally the temperature inside the container {{is equal to}} set point in every location in the container. Unfortunately door-end temperatures are always higher due to poor air flow distribution. In climate chamber tests Lukasse & Staal (2016 a and 2016 b) investigated the effect of covering sections of the container’s T-bar floor. The best T-bar <b>floor</b> <b>cover</b> found in that study was a trapezoid-shape <b>floor</b> <b>cover.</b> The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the effect of that trapezoid-shape T-bar <b>floor</b> <b>cover</b> on temperature and fruit quality in commercial reefer container transports of grapes. A field experiment was done in a commercial container shipment of six standard 40 ft. HC reefer containers travelling from South Africa to The Netherlands taking 24 days. The three test containers contained a T-bar <b>floor</b> <b>cover.</b> The three reference containers did not contain the T-bar <b>floor</b> <b>cover.</b> All other parameters were, to the extent possible, the same for all containers. In 31 locations air temperature between the fruit was logged at an interval of 10 min. with an accuracy of approx. ± 0. 1 °C. 15 Trays, evenly distributed in a vertical plane on the container’s longitudinal centre line, were weighed at origin and at destination. At destination the fruit quality of these 15 trays was analysed. A clear positive effect on temperature was observed. The <b>floor</b> <b>cover</b> reduces the average difference between warmest and coldest temperature in the trays by approx. 30 %. An effect on grape quality could not be assessed...|$|E
