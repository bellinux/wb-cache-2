Multimedia programmes have opened the possibility for ‘anyone who can use a computer’ to become a producer of diaporamas (slide shows). Diaporamas can be very simple or very complex and of variable quality. Quantity can exclude creativity whilst stimulating the diaporama’s evolution and development. It is important to consider the traits that make up the diaporama’s identity, how these differ from the kinetic picture, in which ways they contribute to the static image and the world of art. It is also worthwhile finding out their meaning, validity, why they are so powerful and their relation to the world of creation...|$|E

40|$|<b>Diaporama</b> confidentielThe OPALINE project {{aimed at}} {{understanding}} the determining factors {{of the development}} of food preferences and eating behaviour up to the age of 2 years by following a cohort of children with a longitudinal recording of perinatal and postnatal feeding experiences, of children’s sensitivity to food tastes and odours and of parental feeding practices. The aim was to conjointly analyse the datasets to draw an overall picture of these potential determinants of food preferences and of their relative weight {{over the course of the}} first two years. The recruitment of a cohort of children (N= 314) was conducted thanks to the help of local health and childhood professionals. The milk, complementary and table feeding received by each child and by his/her mother during pregnancy and lactation was recorded using food diaries. The acceptance of food tastes and odours was evaluated at different ages in the laboratory. The family environment was evaluated through questionnaires (parental feeding style; strategies when the child refuses to taste a food; attitudes or criteria to buy foods for children). Food preferences regarding the past three months were measured using questionnaires at 15, 18, 21 and 24 months old. Analyses were based on the Structural Equation Modelling method, to model the causal relationships between these factors and food preferences at weaning and up to the age of 2 years. This presentation will mainly focus on the determinants of liking of vegetables (LVeg), the least liked food category at 2 years. Liking of vegetables at weaning was positively correlated with the variety of vegetables introduced at the beginning of weaning, but it was correlated neither with breastfeeding duration nor with variety of vegetables consumed by the mother during pregnancy (or lactation), and nor with age at weaning. At one year, LVeg was positively correlated with acceptance of bitter taste and of two vegetable odours, 2 -isobutyl- 3 -methoxypyrazine and dimethyl disulphide. LVeg at weaning was positively correlated with LVeg at the later ages up to 2 years. LVeg during the second year was strongly related with the frequency of exposure to vegetables, but surprisingly negatively related with variety. Finally, at 2 years, “permissive” parental feeding strategies were associated to a lower LVeg. This modelling approach makes it possible to evaluate the respective weight of individual factors (acceptance of some flavours), and of parental feeding practices and strategies, i. e. the way to conduct weaning, and their strategies when the child refuses to taste a food in determining children’s food preferences...|$|E

The purpose of these experiments is to highlight the effects of distance on two main dependent variables: teacher discourse and students behaviour. A main hypothesis is tested in this paper: the more controlled the various situational variables are, the more close the two compared teaching situations will be. The results of the studies confirm this hypothesis. In order to show differences among instructional situations, further experiments with more precise variables have to be made. RESUME : L'objet de cet article est de réinterpréter les résultats de trois expérimentations sur l'enseignement à distance dans le cadre théorique de la distance de transaction (DT). Selon cette notion, la perception de la distance entre un enseignant et les apprenants ne dépendrait pas de la distance spatiale, ou même du type de média utilisé. Elle dépend plutôt de trois paramètres : la structure du cours, les possibilités de dialogue entre enseignants et élèves, l'autonomie de ces derniers. Nous avons étudié les effets de la distance en comparant les situations suivantes deux à deux : 1 °) cours en amphithéâtre vs cours à distance; 2 °) cours en amphithéâtre avec <b>diaporama</b> vs cours à distance avec diaporama; 3 °) cours en amphithéâtre vs rediffusion de ce cours sur vidéo. Deux variables dépendantes ont été étudiées : le discours de l'enseignant et le comportement des étudiants. Notre hypothèse étant que, plus les comparaisons sont contrôlées, plus les différences entre les deux situations vont être faibles. Nos résultats vont dans ce sens, et il reste à réaliser d'autres études afin de mettre au jour des différences intersituation.

40|$|Enriching Production {{was first}} {{published}} by Avebury in 1995. The book was quickly sold out and is now made available again. Enriching Production was edited by professor Åke Sandberg, Arbetslivsinstitutet/ National Institute for Working Life and KTH The Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm. Enriching Production was followed up by a symposium on the general theme of ‘Good work and productivity’. The papers were collected in a special issue of Economic and Industrial Democracy, Vol. 19, No 1, February 1998. There will also be follow up articles on Volvo and alternative production systems in a forthcoming reader Absolut management. Scandinavian perspectives on management in the new working life, {{to be published by}} SNS förlag, Stockholm, 2007 / 2008. Abstract Both researchers and practitioners in industrial organization ask themselves today whether lean production is the only possible model for the future. Enriching Production proposes a radically different alternative, which was put into practice at Volvo’s Uddevalla plant during its brief life span. Skilled workers in autonomous teams could altogether abandon the assembly line. With a work content of several hours they built cars according to customer order, with a short delivery time, thus avoiding stocks. In spite of its good performance the plant was closed after only a few years without having developed its full potential. Enriching Production explains the design of the Uddevalla plant and tries to understand its closure against a background of organizational politics and Volvo’s production structure. In comparative chapters the NUMMI and Saturn plants in the US and European car manufacturers are contrasted to the Uddevalla model and also to Volvo’s Kalmar plant with still another form of group work. Chapters on social problems with lean production and recent developments in Japanese car manufacturing also contribute to an understanding of where the car building industry and the organization of industrial production is heading. Although the Uddevalla plant in its original form was closed, the vision of competitive systems of production that do not destroy but enhance human competencies and in a a wider sense a human working life lives on. Enriching Production contributes by reminding us that under certain circumstances good and competitive ways of arranging production are possible.

Writing context References, commentaries, critics “This book [...] a careful selection of well informed and provoking papers [...] provides a solid basis for a reassessment of the socio-technical experiments at the Uddevalla plant and for a critical debate of the lean production system in industry. ” Prof. Dr. Frieder Naschold “This volume should come to represent a classic for all those interested in different national and international trajectories of work and design in industry. ” Alan Jenkins, in Organization Studies “An invaluable aspect of Sandberg’s book is the wealth of comparative information, not only about other Volvo plants in Sweden, but also with regard to those in the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, Malaysia and Canada. … this invaluable collection of readings raises a wide range of additional questions which takes the critical debate about lean production significantly further. Its message is not only of relevance to academics, and managers unconvinced by the evangelical enthusiasm of many advocates of lean production, but also to those trade unions which are keen to preserve their independence through the development of new bargaining strategies {{in the face of an}} onslaught of new management techniques. ” Dave Beale, in Industrial Relations Journal “… this is an important book and one to be read by academics and practitioners alike. Although it appears as a narrative relating to a single company, it goes beyond this; asking what it is we seek from work reforms. ” Peter Cressey, in New Technology, Work and Employment “This book closes the chapter on Uddevalla’s heroic experiment. It helps the sympathetic reader understand what really happened there, and it draws out the positive lessons of Uddevalla for the very unfinished chapter of ongoing worldwide production and work reorganization in today’s turbulent markets. ” Lowell Turner, in Industrial and Labour Relations Review “…essential reading for all those interested in the auto industry and the challenging innovations associated with Volvo. ” Russel Lansbury, in Economic and Industrial Democracy “…detailed and compelling…Enriching Production provides researchers with a very deep vein of information and analysis. ” Steve Babson, in Work and Occupations “This is a valuable collection…for researchers in this area, and for those who teach in the field, this is a useful addition to the literature. ” Human Resource Management Journal “By its rich content, Enriching production is a good vehicle for keeping the discourse on alternative production systems rolling; and on the road” Lars Normann Mikkelsen, in Acta Sociologica Curent relevance See also ✔ Freyssenet M., “La production réflexive, une alternative à la production de masse et à la production au plus juste?”, Sociologie du Travail, n° 3 / 1995, pp 365 - 388.
