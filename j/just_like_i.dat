500|$|As his Beatles era segued {{into his}} solo career, his singing voice found a {{widening}} range of expression. Biographer Chris Gregory writes of Lennon [...] "tentatively beginning to expose his insecurities {{in a number}} of acoustic-led 'confessional' ballads, so beginning the process of 'public therapy' that will eventually culminate in the primal screams of [...] "Cold Turkey" [...] and the cathartic John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band." [...] Music critic Robert Christgau calls this Lennon's [...] "greatest vocal performance... from scream to whine, is modulated electronically... echoed, filtered, and double tracked." [...] David Stuart Ryan notes Lennon's vocal delivery to range from [...] "extreme vulnerability, sensitivity and even naivety" [...] to a hard [...] "rasping" [...] style. Wiener too describes contrasts, saying the singer's voice can be [...] "at first subdued; soon it almost cracks with despair". Music historian Ben Urish recalls hearing the Beatles' Ed Sullivan Show performance of [...] "This Boy" [...] played on the radio a few days after Lennon's murder: [...] "As Lennon's vocals reached their peak... it hurt too much to hear him scream with such anguish and emotion. But it was my emotions I heard in his voice. <b>Just</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> always had." ...|$|E
500|$|Music critics universally {{criticized the}} video {{because of the}} limited amount of {{clothing}} Hilson wore in it. In an interview with gossip hound Perez Hilton, Hilson defended the clip, calling the video [...] "racy" [...] but {{in line with the}} perspective of her album: [...] "If you put it in context with my album, my album is called No Boys Allowed but really it means no bullshit allowed. In this album, I was screaming in a room — <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was screaming in the song — I was screaming in a room with all my girlfriends, yelling all the shit we really say." [...] Rebecca Thomas of MTV News wrote: [...] "A platinum-blond Keri gyrates, thrusts, licks and gets (way) low as she laces the song with enough saucy language and expletives to make your favorite rapper blush." [...] while Jocelyn Vena the same news division of MTV commented that even though there are several cameo appearances in the mini-move, it is ultimately Hilson's [...] "scantily clad popping and locking that has everyone buzzing." [...] Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine called the video [...] "overproduced and under-clothed." ...|$|E
500|$|Ryan {{stresses}} that coaches are essentially {{supposed to be}} open and communicative with the players and management, who in turn will reciprocate the same attitude. By connecting with his associates, Ryan states, it's [...] "valuable {{when it comes to}} figuring out how to motivate somebody (...) because I want that guy to fight for me, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> want to fight for him." [...] Fullback Tony Richardson, in an interview, stated Ryan [...] "loves his football team, loves his players" [...] and does as much as he possibly can to ensure their success. Despite his boisterous and brash comments that have caused increased media coverage of the team, Ryan has taken the attention and has managed to [...] " [...] it on himself" [...] so the players can focus on their tasks. Ryan has also stressed that the teaching process is an important one, {{particularly when it comes to}} providing a player information and building chemistry. However, there has to be flexibility as the process must also be insightful and positive. Ryan states that coaches are responsible for providing players with information that is vitally important otherwise [...] "if you emphasize everything, you've emphasized nothing." ...|$|E

2500|$|During an {{interview}} with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos, President Barack Obama praised the protesters, but cautioned against protest tactics that he felt stifled open dialogue at the University of Missouri and other campuses. He said, [...] "There is clearly a problem at the University of Missouri, and that's not just coming from students. That's coming from some faculty. And I think it is entirely appropriate for students in a thoughtful, peaceful way to protest—what they see as injustices or inattention to serious problems in their midst.

Oxford won all three matches although Eddy (as he was known) made only 8 runs in total during these matches. Shrimp Leveson Gower records in his Recollections of Oxford cricket an incident forty years later when he had scored 73 runs in Oxford's first innings.

2500|$|On March 17, 2014, Gossow {{released}} a statement announcing her departure from the group and welcoming her replacement, former vocalist of Canadian extreme metal band The Agonist, Alissa White-Gluz. In the statement, she wrote that while she had enjoyed her time with the group, {{it was time for}} her to move on, be with her family and pursue other interests. Gossow did confirm that she would remain Arch Enemy's business manager, and would be [...] "passing the torch to the super talented Alissa White-Gluz, whom I’ve known as a dear friend and a superb vocalist for many years.

2500|$|Also in 1908, {{with her}} Viața Românească articles, Sadoveanu turned her {{attention}} to the impact of Symbolism and the anti-traditionalist Romanian Symbolist branch. As she herself argued decades later: [...] "I was the only one to express the opinion that [...] we are dealing with an innovative movement, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was the first one in history to sketch out Symbolism in articles for Viața Românească". According to various commentators of her work, cited by literary historian Paul Cernat, she was indeed the first Romanian to take an interest in the movement, and who therefore opened a channel of communication between the Poporanists and the Romanian Symbolists. This assessment is partly contradicted by researcher Angelo Mitchievici, who reviews earlier such essays written by Alexandru Bibescu and Elena Bacaloglu.|$|E
2500|$|During a December 3, 2009 {{interview}} on Rusty Humphries' radio talk show, Humphries asked Sarah Palin {{if she would}} make Barack Obama's birth certificate a campaign issue in 2012, should she decide to run. Palin responded, [...] "I think the public rightfully is still making it an issue. I don't {{have a problem with}} that. I don't know if I would have to bother to make it an issue, because I think that members of the electorate still want answers." [...] Humphries followed up, asking whether she thinks Obama's birth certificate is a fair question to be looking at. Palin answered, [...] "I think it's a fair question, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> think past association and past voting records– all of that is fair game. The McCain–Palin campaign didn't do a good enough job in that area." ...|$|E

2500|$|..... One {{morning as}} I was making my thanksgiving after Communion, {{a very strong}} {{distraction}} took hold of me. I thought I saw a great plain full of people enveloped in thick fog. They were walking about like people who had lost their way {{and did not know}} which way to turn. Someone near me said: 'This is England'. I was just going to ask some questions, when I saw Pope Pius IX <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> have seen him in pictures. He was robed magnificently and carried in his hand a torch alive with flames. As he walked slowly towards that immense gathering of people, the leaping flames from the torch dispelled the fog, and the people stood in the splendour of the noonday sun. 'That torch', said the one beside me, 'is the Catholic Faith, which is going to light up England'".|$|E

2500|$|He put Death on hold {{after this}} to {{continue}} Control Denied, {{which he had}} been putting together prior to the release of The Sound of Perseverance, and released The Fragile Art of Existence in 1999. Control Denied also had other players from the latest Death album but featured a melodic metal vocalist. Schuldiner also played guitar in the [...] "supergroup" [...] Voodoocult on the album Jesus Killing Machine in 1994 and played a guest solo on Naphobia's 1995 release, Of Hell on the track [...] "As Ancients Evolve" [...] as a favor to the band's bassist at the time who was a friend of Schuldiner's. Schuldiner was also asked {{to be one of the}} many guest vocalists on Dave Grohl's 2001 Probot. Grohl, Napalm Death, Ozzy Osbourne, and Anthrax all increased efforts to raise funds for Schuldiner's medical bills with Grohl trying to involve Schuldiner on an album he was working on. In a 1999 interview Schuldiner spoke about why he didn't sing on the album The Fragile Art of Existence [...] "...these vocals are all I ever wanted to do in Death but couldn't. I've had this dream of recording like that for years, and it seems like a dream come true. Tim Aymar is an amazing singer and this is the main difference. I think people will be surprised at the violence and strength of the album. Many people are expecting something like Iron Maiden, but, despite being one of my favorite bands, I didn't want to make an Iron Maiden-like album. I wanted to make an unpredictable album, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> did in Death, I guess. I don't like to make predictable albums." ...|$|E
