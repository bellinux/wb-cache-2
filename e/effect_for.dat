Simultaneously, a hurricane watch went into <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, while {{a tropical storm}} warning was issued for St. Lucia. It was then that the tropical storm watch in St. Vincent and the Grenadines was discontinued. Later on October 19, {{the hurricane}} watch previously issued for the Virgin Island and Puerto Rico was upgraded to a hurricane warning. In St. Lucia, the hurricane watch was canceled. At 1200 UTC on October 20, a hurricane warning as put into <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> Desirade, St. Martin, and St. Barthelemy.

5|$|Culture: Although {{there are}} many {{differences}} between Eastern and Western cultures, including as to how often family names or initials are used, the effect seems to apply across cultures.

5|$|Early in the {{duration}} of the storm, the National Hurricane Center consistently forecast Ivan to track further to the north than it eventually did. Late on September 5, the government of Barbados issued a hurricane watch for its territory. Shortly thereafter, Saint Lucia was put under a hurricane watch and Grenada and its dependencies were put under a tropical storm watch. As the hurricane approached the southern Lesser Antilles, more watches were issued, and by 24hours prior to Ivan passing through the island chain a hurricane warning was in <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> Barbados, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Lucia, Tobago, and Grenada, and a tropical storm warning was in <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> Trinidad. With the path of Ivan more southerly than predicted, the hurricane warnings were downgraded to tropical storm warnings for the northern islands, and by late on September 7 when the eye of the hurricane passed near Grenada, hurricane warnings were in <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, and Grenada. Subsequently, a tropical storm warning was issued for the northern coast of Venezuela through the Guajira Peninsula of Colombia.|$|E

5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the storm, the National Weather Service placed much of central, north and western Georgia under a flood watch. A wind advisory was also in <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb and Fulton Counties. As the hurricane's outer rainbands approached the state, a tornado watch was put into <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> central portions of the state. The Red Cross provided 80shelters in the state, in addition to hundreds of volunteers. Due to large evacuations in the state, construction projects on Interstates 75, 85, and 185, were postponed.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Cosme was {{predicted}} {{to make landfall}} on Hawaii as a tropical storm. In anticipation of the storm, the National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch for the island of Hawaii on July 20.

High surf advisories were also put into <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> coastal areas. The Hawaii County Civil Defense prepared for the storm by planning for increases in emergency response personnel and opening of evacuation centers.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} wealth {{effects and}} changes in the systematic risk associated with the return structure of the “three-pillar” functional system in Greece, resulting from the introduction of the eight major European Union Banking Directives over the period 1990 - 94. The findings indicate that the systematic risk for the insurance and investment firms dramatically increased, while the systematic risk for commercial banks slightly increased through the passage of the Free Capital Movement Directive. Evidence was also found to show that the Free Capital Movement Directive created significant wealth <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> the investment firms, but insignificant wealth <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> banks. In addition, a marginal wealth <b>effect</b> was created <b>for</b> the insurance firms. Conversely, the results suggest that the Solvency Ratios and Own Funds Banking Directives produced no wealth <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> the banks, significant wealth <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> the insurance firms, and insignificant wealth <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> the investment firms. The wealth effects {{of the rest of the}} EU Banking Directives on the functional “three-pillar” Greek financial system were neutral.

5|$|On August 13, 2004, a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for Cape Fear, southward to South Carolina. The watch was extended northward to Oregon Inlet later that day; the watch further extended to Chincoteague, Virginia. The tropical storm watch from Cape Lookout to Oregon Inlet was changed to a hurricane warning. A hurricane watch was subsequently put into <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> coastal areas from Oregon Inlet to the North Carolina/Virginia border, although by August 15 all advisories were discontinued. Flood watches were also placed into <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> portions of the state.|$|E
