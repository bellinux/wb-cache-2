2500|$|Numerous codeine salts {{have been}} {{prepared}} since the drug was discovered. The most commonly used are the hydrochloride (freebase conversion ratio 0.805), phosphate (0.736), sulphate (0.859), and citrate (0.842). Others include a salicylate NSAID, codeine salicylate (0.686), a bromide (codeine methylbromide, 0.759), and at least four codeine-based barbiturates, the cyclohexenylethylbarbiturate (0.559), cyclopentenylallylbarbiturate (0.561), <b>diallylbarbiturate</b> (0.561), and diethylbarbiturate (0.619). The latter was introduced as Codeonal in 1912, indicated for pain with nervousness. [...] Codeine methylbromide is also considered a separate drug for various purposes.|$|E
40|$|Coi'onary {{blood flow}} in the dog has been {{measured}} by the nitrous oxide desaturation method before and after acute bilateral cervical vagotomy, intravenous injection of atropine, and chronic sympathectomy. Vagotomy and atropine markedly increased coronary flow, myoeardial oxygen consumption, and heart rate, but decreased left ventricular efficiency. Chronic sympatheetomy resulted in the following smaller but statistically significant changes: a decrease in coronary flow, myoeardial oxygen con-sumption, and heart rate, but an increase in left ventricular efficiency. Increasing the oxygen content of the arterial blood decreased the coronary flow. A comparison of <b>diallylbarbiturate</b> acid and urethane with morphine and chloralose anes-thesia gave similar flow values, but cardiac efficiency was increased in the latter case. An analysis {{of the relationships between}} coronary flow, left ventricular oxygen con-sumption, and the arteriovenous oxygen difference is presented. MEASUREMENTS of coronary blood flowin man and in the dog have been made with increasing frequency in recent years, due to the application of the nitrous oxide method...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to build on past work from this laboratory by testing the hypothesis that medullary lateral tegmental field (LTF) neurons {{play a critical role in}} mediating sympathoexcitatory responses to activation of sympathetic afferent fibers. We studied the effects of microinjection of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) or non-NMDA receptor antagonists or muscimol bilaterally into the LTF on the area under the curve of the computer-averaged sympathoexcitatory potential in the right inferior cardiac nerve elicited by short trains of stimuli applied to afferent fibers in the left inferior cardiac or left splanchnic nerve (CN, SN) of baroreceptor-denervated and vagotomized cats anesthetized with a mixture of <b>diallylbarbiturate</b> and urethane. In contrast to our hypothesis, sympathoexcitatory responses to stimulation of CN (n = 5 – 7) or SN (n = 4 – 7) afferent fibers were not significantly affected by these procedures. We then determined whether the rostral and caudal ventrolateral medulla (RVLM, CVLM) and nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) were involved in mediating these reflexes. Blockade of non-NMDA, but not NMDA, receptors in the RVLM significantly reduced the area under the curve of the sympathoexcitatory responses to electrical stimulation of either CN (P = 0. 0110; n = 6) or SN (P = 0. 0131; n = 5) afferent fibers. Neither blockade of excitatory amino acid receptors nor chemical inactivation of CVLM or NTS significantly affected the responses. These data show that activation of non-NMDA receptors in the RVLM is a critical step in mediating the sympatho-sympathetic reflex...|$|E
