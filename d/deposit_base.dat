25|$|The {{international}} credit crunch presented the first challenge to AIB— namely a dramatic fall-off in liquidity. As AIB depends {{to a significant}} extent on the international financial markets for liquidity due to an insufficient <b>deposit</b> <b>base,</b> this has impacted the bank severely. The Irish government stepped in with a guarantee which effectively granted a triple A rating on AIB debt, thus freeing up its access to finance.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, the United States Congress granted all thrifts, {{including}} {{savings and}} loan associations, {{the power to make}} consumer and commercial loans and to issue transaction accounts. Designed to help the thrift industry retain its <b>deposit</b> <b>base</b> and to improve its profitability, the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act (DIDMCA) of 1980 allowed thrifts to make consumer loans up to 20 percent of their assets, issue credit cards, accept negotiable order of withdrawal [...] accounts from individuals and nonprofit organizations, and invest up to 20 percent of their assets in commercial real estate loans.|$|E
2500|$|Mounting {{concern over}} the disarray in {{economic}} policy was reflected in an accelerated [...] "dollarization" [...] of the economy as residents switched domestic assets into foreign-currency deposits to protect their investments. By the end of 1994, about 50 {{percent of the total}} <b>deposit</b> <b>base</b> was held in the form of foreign-currency deposits, up from 1 percent in 1993. The downgrading by credit-rating agencies and a lack of confidence in the government's budget deficit target of 14 percent of GDP for 1994 triggered large-scale capital flight and the collapse of the exchange rate. The government had to intervene by selling its foreign-currency reserves to staunch the decline of the Turkish lira. As a result, reserves fell from US$6.3 billion at the end of 1993 to US$3 billion by the end of March 1994. Before the end of April, when the government was forced to announce a long-overdue austerity program following the March 1994 local elections, the lira had plummeted by 76 percent from the end of 1993 to TL41,000 against the United States dollar.|$|E

50|$|Capital Bank {{was founded}} by William Ato Essien on 29 October 2009 as a {{microfinance}} company.

The Bank of Ghana states that FCP has a market share of 16% of the advances of savings and loans companies and 19% of the sector total assets. The Bank currently employs 355 and has 15 branches covering five regions.The company grew its base deposit and assets from its inception till 2013 when it applied and was awarded a provisional universal banking license in July, 2012.

30|$|MECHANISM is {{a measure}} of the {{interest}} rate on <b>deposits</b> (price <b>based),</b> a measure of the amount of <b>deposits</b> (quantity <b>based),</b> or a measure of time terms (maturity based).

X represents other control variables. Thus, a significant coefficient of bank risk, with the theoretical expected sign, indicates the presence of market discipline.|$|R
