High-frequency data collected from the actual trading platform, EBS, are used. First, impacts on returns are analyzed. <b>Macroeconomic</b> <b>statistics</b> releases that consistently had significant effects on exchange rate returns include Tankan survey (a short-term business survey conducted by Bank of Japan), GDP, industrial production (preliminary), PPI, CPI (Tokyo area), the unemployment rate and Balance of Payment <b>statistics.</b> <b>Macroeconomic</b> <b>statistics</b> releases {{that did not have}} impacts on returns include Trade Balance, Retail Sales and Housing start indicators.

40|$|Through the astute {{analysis}} of official statistics, we can gather {{a more complete}} picture of the economic performance of a given country, and understand more fully what have been its drivers, leading to a more effective use of national resources and a more efficient design of policy options. However, the myriad of information and numerical data across the system of <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>statistics</b> can be challenging to interpret in a straightforward manner. In order to synthetically assess economic performance across countries in Latin America we propose {{the use of a}} composite indicator, which builds upon the methodology of Khramov and Lee (2013) and incorporates key indicators from each of the pillars of macroeconomic statistics: the System of National Accounts, the Balance of Payments Statistics, Monetary and Financial Statistics and Public Finance Statistics.
