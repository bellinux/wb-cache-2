5|$|Burgundy and Franche-Comté {{are known}} for their wines. Pike, perch, river crabs, snails, game, redcurrants, {{blackcurrants}} are from both Burgundy and Franche-Comté. Amongst savorous specialties accounted in the Cuisine franc-comtoise from the Franche-Comté region are Croûte aux morilles, Poulet à la Comtoise, trout, smoked meats and cheeses such as Mont d'Or, Comté and Morbier which are at the palate best eaten <b>hot</b> <b>or</b> <b>cold,</b> the exquisite Coq au vin jaune and the special dessert gâteau de ménage. Charolais beef, poultry from Bresse, sea snail, honey cake, Chaource and Epoisses cheese are specialties of the local cuisine of Burgundy. Dijon mustard is also a specialty of Burgundy cuisine. Crème de cassis is a popular liquor made from the blackcurrants. Oil are used in the cooking here, types include nut oils and rapeseed oil.|$|E
5|$|Different {{climatic factors}} {{influence}} {{the climate of}} Buenos Aires. The semi–permanent South Atlantic High influences its climate throughout the year by bringing in moist winds from the northeast, which bring most of the precipitation to {{the city in the}} form of frontal systems during winter or storms produced by cyclogenesis in autumn and winter. The hot temperatures and high insolation in the summer months form a low pressure system called the Chaco Low over northern Argentina, generating a pressure gradient that brings moist easterly winds to the city – because of this, summer is the rainiest season. In contrast, this low pressure system weakens in the winter, which combined with strong southerly winds results in a drier season due to weaker easterly winds. Being located in the Pampas, Buenos Aires has variable weather due to the passage of contrasting air mass – the cold, dry Pampero from the south and warm, humid tropical air from the north. The coastal location results in a strong maritime influence, causing extreme temperatures (<b>hot</b> <b>or</b> <b>cold)</b> to be rare.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of <b>hotter</b> <b>or</b> <b>colder</b> {{particles}} {{on the evolution of}} the chiral magnetic field in the early universe. We are interested in the temperature dependent term in the chiral vortical effect. There are no changes in the magnetic energy spectrum at large lengthscales but in the Kolmogorov regime we do find a difference. Our numerical results show that the Gaussian peak in the magnetic spectrum becomes negatively skewed. The negatively skewed peak can be fitted with a beta distribution. Analytically one can relate the non-Gaussianity of the distribution to the temperature dependent vorticity term. The vorticity term is therefore responsible for the beta distribution in the magnetic spectrum. Since the beta distribution has already been used to model turbulent dispersion in fluids, hence it seems that the presence of <b>hotter</b> <b>or</b> <b>colder</b> particles may lead to turbulence in the magnetized plasma.

25|$|Consequently, <b>hot</b> <b>or</b> <b>cold</b> {{environmental}} temperatures {{can reduce}} the proportion of REM sleep, as well as amount of total sleep. In other words, if {{at the end of}} a phase of deep sleep, the organism's thermal indicators fall outside of a certain range, it will not enter paradoxical sleep lest deregulation allow temperature to drift further from the desirable value. This mechanism can be 'fooled' by artificially warming the brain.|$|E

25|$|The medical {{practices}} of the Byzantine Empire originated from the Greek physician Hippocrates and Roman Physician Galen.

These humors were connected to particular seasons, <b>hot</b> <b>or</b> <b>cold</b> and dry or moist. In order to identifying these humors Byzantine physicians relied heavily on Galen's works.|$|E
