5|$|In 2003, CrossGen {{published}} John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles, a four-part {{comic book}} miniseries. The story takes place {{a day or}} so after the events of Escape from New York. Snake has been given a military Humvee after his presidential pardon and makes his way to Atlantic City. Although the director's cut of Escape from New York shows Snake was caught after a bank job, this story has Snake finishing up a second heist that was pre-planned before his capture. The job entails stealing the car in which John F. Kennedy was assassinated from a casino before delivering it to a buyer in the Gulf of Mexico. Snake partners with a man named Marrs who ends up double crossing him. Left for dead in a sinking crab cage, Snake escapes and is saved by a passing fisherman named Captain Ron (an in-joke referring to Kurt Russell's 1992 comedy, Captain Ron). When Ron denies Snake's request to use his boat in order to beat Marrs to the robbery, Snake decides to kill him. When Snake ends up saving Ron from the Russian mob who wants money, Ron changes his mind and helps Snake. Once at the casino, Snake comes face-to-face with Marrs and his men, who arrive at the same time, ending in a high-speed shootout. Snake <b>gets</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> the car and its actress portraying Jackie Kennedy, leaving Marrs to be caught by the casino owner, who cuts him a deal to bring his car back and live. After some trouble, Snake manages to finally get the car to the buyer's yacht, using Ron's boat, and is then attacked by Marrs. Following the firefight, the yacht and car are destroyed, Marrs and Captain Ron are dead, and Snake makes his escape in a helicopter with the 30 million credits owed to him for the job.|$|E

[...] On the second review, Channing Freeman wrote that [...] "Sober" [...] is [...] "one of the few tracks [...] where Clarkson <b>gets</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> her vocal restraint, mainly because at the end she lets loose and gives one of the best performances of her career, making the two or so minutes of waiting worthwhile."

She also noted that he's been jailed, thrown in a psychiatric ward and shot, had amnesia, epilepsy among other events, but [...] "like all villains worth their salt, he's survived it all and inspired respect, if not adoration". Braeden describes the character as [...] "the villain" [...] and as [...] "defensive and always self-protective", stating that he's [...] "not here to win a popularity contest". He stated that he enjoys portraying Victor [...] "more than anything", also describing him as [...] "very complex". Braeden said that [...] "he fought himself to the position he arrived at a number of years ago", and that [...] "he obviously doesn't suffer fools easily, doesn't suffer enemies easily.

[...] The actor, comparing himself to the character, noted that he is nothing like Victor, stating: [...] "Money makes a lot of things happen for Victor.

One of 2010's best-reviewed releases, the album received praise for its Afrofuturistic concept and Monáe's eclectic musical range. Michael Cragg of The Guardian found its [...] "sheer musical scope" [...] "spellbinding". AllMusic writer Andy Kellman praised Monáe's creativity {{and called it}} [...] "an extravagant 70-minute album involving more imagination, conceptual detail, and stylistic turnabouts than most gatefold prog rock epics". Barry Walters of Spin noted German Expressionism and Afrofuturism as conceptual elements on the album and stated [...] "She's venturing {{so far away from}} soul that she's come back around to it". Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot called it [...] "an audacious, sometimes bewildering statement". Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that [...] "Monáe <b>gets</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> most of her metamorphoses, and the sheer ambition is exhilarating even when she stretches too far". Matthew Cole from Slant Magazine described it as [...] "an elaborately performed and consummately freaky cyberpunk epic... so stylistically leftfield in terms of its sound". The A.V. Clubs Genevieve Koski wrote that [...] "Monáe’s inexhaustible swagger and singular style sell both the high-concept theatrics and the schizophrenic sonics". Pitchforks Matthew Perpetua called the album [...] "about as bold as mainstream music gets, marrying the world-building possibilities of the concept album to the big tent genre-mutating pop of Michael Jackson and Prince in their prime".

2500|$|Due to the Komondor's size, power, {{speed and}} temperament, {{a lack of}} {{obedience}} training can result in danger to others. [...] Komondors generally take well to training if started early (ideally between 4–8 months). A Komondor can become obstinate when bored, so {{it is imperative that}} training sessions be upbeat and happy. Praise is a must, as are consistent and humane corrections. Once a Komondor <b>gets</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> unfriendly or hostile behavior, it will always think such behavior is appropriate. Therefore, consistent corrections even with a young puppy are necessary to ensure a well-adjusted adult. Socialization is also extremely important. The Komondor should be exposed to new situations, people and other dogs as a puppy. Because it is a natural guard dog, a Komondor that is not properly socialized may react in an excessively aggressive manner when confronted with a new situation or person.|$|E
2500|$|The {{issue of}} [...] "authenticity" [...] in {{relation}} to an approach like Gould's has been a topic of great debate, although diminished {{by the end of}} the 20th century—a development that Gould seems to have anticipated. It asks whether a recording is less authentic or [...] "direct" [...] for having been highly refined by technical means in the studio. Gould likened his process to that of a film director—one does not perceive that a two-hour film was made in two hours—and implicitly asks why the act of listening to music should be any different. He went so far as to conduct an experiment with musicians, sound engineers, and laypeople in which they were to listen to a recording and determine where the splices occurred. Each group chose different points based on their relationship to music, but none successfully. While the conclusion was hardly scientific, Gould remarked, [...] "The tape does lie, and nearly always <b>gets</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> it".|$|E
