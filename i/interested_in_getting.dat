25|$|As Sun He was intelligent, Sun Quan favoured him {{and often}} kept {{him by his}} side. Sun Quan also treated Sun He {{exceptionally}} well; he gave Sun He new clothes, ornaments, toys and other gifts, but did not {{do the same for}} his other sons. Sun Quan's subjects also highly regarded Sun He because he was not only bright, perceptive and well-versed in literary arts, horse-riding and archery, but also respectful and courteous towards his tutors and elders. He was genuinely <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> to know people. In 247, Sun Quan ordered Zhuge Yi (諸葛壹) to pretend to defect to Wu's rival state, Wei, and lure the Wei general Zhuge Dan into a trap. When Sun Quan personally led the Wu forces to attack Zhuge Dan, Sun He showed grave concern about his father: he could not rest and have his meals in peace, repeatedly reminded his father to be careful, and hoped that his father would win the battle. He only put aside his worries upon seeing his father return safely to Wu.|$|E

500|$|In late 1990, Nintendo Power gave [...] free {{copies of}} Dragon Warrior to subscribers, {{including}} a 64-page [...] "Explorer's Handbook" [...] {{that has a}} full walkthrough {{of the game and}} additional backstory not mentioned in the original instruction booklet. Nintendo was reportedly <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> rid of unsold copies of the game, so it gave them away to subscribers. At the time, the game cost approximately [...] at retail and the magazine's subscription fee was only [...] ($ and $ respectively, adjusted for inflation). The giveaway attracted nearly 500,000 new magazine subscribers, and many more renewed their subscription just to get the game. This ultimately led {{to the success of the}} series in the Western market.|$|E
500|$|Rubin {{encouraged}} a [...] "back to basics" [...] approach and wanted {{the group to}} bring finished songs to the studio. This approach conflicted with U2's freeform recording style, by which they improvised material in the studio. The Edge said, [...] "we sort of hadn't really finished the songs. It's typical for us, because it's {{in the process of}} recording that we really do our writing." [...] Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "once we have a song, we're interested in the atmospherics and the tones and the overdubs and the different stuff you can do with it... things that Rick was not in the slightest bit interested in. He was <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> it from embryonic stage to a song that could be mixed and put on a record." [...] They ultimately decided to shelve the material recorded with Rubin, but expressed interest in revisiting it in the future.|$|E

500|$|Stan Love, Wilson's {{cousin and}} band manager, fired Landy in December 1976 when Landy doubled his fee. Landy remembered 15 Big Ones as [...] "the only major success" [...] the Beach Boys had in recent years; [...] "Brian and I did that together. Right after that, I {{had to leave}} the situation. ... I was {{interested}} in making Brian a whole human being; they [...] were <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> another album done in time for 1977." [...] In 1977, Wilson was asked if Landy had too much control; he said, [...] "I thought so, but there was nothing I could do about it and I eventually gave in to it.... control of my life legally through the commitment of my wife.... He definitely helped me. It cost over a hundred thousand dollars – he charged {{a hell of a lot}} per month." [...] Wilson then reported that Landy was replaced with a new doctor, Steve Schwartz. After several sessions with Wilson, Schwartz died in a camping accident, falling off a mountain to his death.|$|E
500|$|According to Blair, [...] "Khánh {{could play}} Lodge like a musical instrument" [...] in {{justifying}} his coup. The day after coming to power, Khánh further claimed to Lodge that Don was {{in possession of}} briefing papers from the Americans on plans for the bombing of North Vietnam {{and said that they}} were in danger of being handed over to the communists. Khánh further claimed to be desperately trying to retrieving the documents to prevent the communists from accessing the material. Blair cited Lodge's immediate response—he took Khánh seriously and sent an urgent cable to Washington through the top-secret CIA channel—as an example of gullibility with respect to Khánh's tendency to make grandiose and self-serving claims. Lodge was also greatly reassured by Khánh's assurances to support US bombing of North Vietnam, increased actions against the Viet Cong and an increase in US advisers down to village level. Lodge also told Khánh that military progress was the bottom line as far as continued US support for his leadership was concerned. According to Blair, [...] "For Lodge, when something was done, it was done, and he cleared his mind of all but the cover-story". She said that Lodge was not <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> detailed information on the coup, only that [...] "the best information was that the coup was planned and carried out by General Thieu".|$|E
2500|$|Burbank {{was criticized}} by {{scientists}} {{of his day}} {{because he did not}} keep the kind of careful records that are the norm in scientific research and because he was mainly <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> results rather than in basic research.

2500|$|Overall {{ridership}} on New Jersey's Hudson and Manhattan Railroad declined substantially {{from a high}} of 113million {{riders in}} 1927 to 26million in 1958, after new automobile tunnels and bridges opened across the Hudson River. The State of New Jersey was <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to take over the railroad, but the Port Authority long viewed it as something unprofitable and had no interest in doing so.

2500|$|Lacking any safe alternative, on 16 December, tanks 611 and 619 were {{emptied of}} the {{remaining}} MIC by reactivating the plant and continuing the manufacture of pesticide. Despite safety precautions such as having water carrying helicopters continually overflying the plant, {{this led to a}} second mass evacuation from Bhopal. The Government of India passed the [...] "Bhopal Gas Leak Disaster Act" [...] that gave the government rights to represent all victims, whether or not in India. Complaints of lack of information or misinformation were widespread. An Indian government spokesman said, [...] "Carbide is more <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> information from us than in helping our relief work".|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the filming}} of the Kung Fu TV movie began, there was some {{discussion}} {{as to whether or}} not an Asian actor should play Kwai Chang Caine. Bruce Lee was considered for the role. In 1971, Bruce Lee wasn't the cult film hero he later became for his roles in The Big Boss (1971), Fist of Fury (1972), Way of the Dragon (1972) and Enter the Dragon (1973). At that point he was best known as Kato on TV's Green Hornet (1966–1967) (Kung Fu guest actor Robert Ito reports that Lee hated the role of Kato because he [...] "thought it was so subservient"). [...] "In my eyes and in the eyes of Jerry Thorpe," [...] says Harvey Frand, [...] "David Carradine was always our first choice to play Caine. But there was some disagreement because the network was interested in a more muscular actor and the studio was <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> Bruce Lee." [...] Frand says Lee wouldn't have really been appropriate for the series—despite the fact that he went on to considerable success in the martial arts film world. The Kung Fu show needed a serene person, and Carradine was more appropriate for the role. Ed Spielman agrees: [...] "I liked David in the part. One of Japan's foremost Karate champions used to say that the only qualification that was needed to be trained in the martial arts was that you had to know how to dance. And on top of being an accomplished athlete and actor, David could dance." [...] Nonetheless, grumbling from the Asian community would have made sense, given the fact that major roles for Asian actors were almost nonexistent. James Hong, an actor on the show and ex-president of the Association of Asian/Pacific American Artists (AAPAA) says that at the time Asian actors felt that [...] "if they were going to do a so-called Asian hero on Kung Fu, then why don't they hire an Asian actor to play the lead? But then the show went on, we realized that it was a great source of employment for the Asian acting community." [...] In fact, Hong says, Carradine had a good relationship with the Asian community.|$|E

[...] He maps out the area and leads a UNIT team down into some caves to find his TARDIS. [...] After a tense exchange with the UNIT commander, the worm creatures attack and the Doctor separates himself from the group and hitches a ride in a giant underground worm to the main lair of the aliens. [...] There he meets Prime, commander of the Shalka. [...] Prime declares humans inferior and subject to their domination. [...] The Doctor attempts to act inept to extract information from Prime, who sees through the act and calls him out on it. [...] Prime reveals that the Shalka are 2000 strong and will be invading the surface soon. [...] The Doctor attempts another bluff, declaring himself a non-human and therefore uninterested in what happens to the humans. [...] Prime orders Alison executed in hot lava, which forces the Doctor to make a deal to spare her life. He allows the Shalka into the TARDIS and de-activates the Master, who turns out to be an android programmed by the Doctor. [...] The Shalka tell the Doctor his technology is inferior and they do not need him. [...] He is cast into a black hole they have created inside Earth that they are using as a gateway to bring in more troops and also to dispose of people they do not need. [...] As he is plummeting into the black hole the Doctor realizes his phone is still connected to the TARDIS and uses it to summon the TARDIS.
