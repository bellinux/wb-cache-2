500|$|The initial storyline {{developed}} for the attraction would have seen riders enter {{a replica of the}} Orlando International Airport, before being ushered onto people movers taking them to the underground to the MIB training facility. However, executives were unsure of the concept and instead wanted at least one recognisable item from the 1997 film to be on the outside facade. Responding to the concern, designers chose the film's flying saucer-shaped towers, adding elements [...] of a building from the 1964 World's Fair, Dodgers Stadium, and the St. Louis Arch to form the facade. Other elements of the storyline also did not make the final cut. The <b>immigration</b> <b>office</b> from the film is featured in the attraction's queue; however, it was intended that it would feature numerous animatronics. However, due to the large animatronics budget for the ride itself, this idea was scrapped. In homage, ride employees for {{the first few months of}} the ride's operation would take their breaks in the room, to give the effect of a working office.|$|E

40|$|Due to stress, the {{workplace}} is a setting where actions of health promotion are of great importance in the perspective of public health. Stress is caused by heavy workload, low control of organizing their tasks and lack of support from colleagues and supervisors. This can lead to cardiovascular disease, depression and insomnia. Due to the health problems that this causes, {{it is important to}} examine how senior <b>immigration</b> <b>offices</b> perceive their psychosocial work environment. The aim of this thesis is to examine how the senior <b>immigration</b> <b>offices</b> at the Migration Board perceive their psychosocial work environment. The study is based on a qualitative approach with deductive content analysis and the data has therefore been collected through interviewing six people based on a semi-structured interview guide. The result has shown that the senior <b>immigration</b> <b>offices</b> are pleased with their work environment and that their workload is constantly changing. Lack of support from their team leader and manager has been identified and was also required to be improved. They also feel that lack of development opportunities and low participation and influence affect their job satisfaction. A discussion was hold due to how the senior immigration officers perceived their work environment in contrast to previous research. The finding in the conclusion indicates that it is a request and a need for improved communication skills and leadership within the department...|$|R
