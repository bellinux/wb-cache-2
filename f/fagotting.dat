5000|$|Reid {{was known}} for {{innovative}} and fashionable swimsuit designs and production. She was the first swimsuit designer to use inner brassieres, tummy-tuck panels, stay-down legs, elastic banding, brief skirts, and foundation garments in swimwear. She {{was also the first}} designer to introduce dress sizes in swimwear, designing swimwear for multiple sizes and types of bodies, rather than just producing one standard size. Reid filed for a U.S. Patent in 1950 for a one-piece bathing suit using elastic fabric and that lacked buttons. Her company patented a machine for a <b>fagotting</b> stitch that became a hallmark of her designs. She had several other patents for swimsuits and accessories.|$|E
