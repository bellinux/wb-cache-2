40|$|A {{continuous}} {{powder coating}} system {{was developed for}} coating carbon fiber with LaRC-TPI (Langley Research Center-Thermoplastic Polyimide), a high-temperature thermoplastic polymide invented by NASA-Langley. The coating line developed used a pneumatic fiber spreader to separate the individual fibers. The polymer was applied within a recirculating powder coating chamber then melted {{using a combination of}} direct electrical resistance and convective heating to make it adhere to the fiber tow. The tension and speed of the line were controlled with a <b>dancer</b> <b>arm</b> and an electrically driven fiber wind-up and wind-off. The effects of heating during the coating process on the flexibility of the prepreg produced were investigated. The uniformity with which the fiber tow could be coated with polymer also was examined. Composite specimens were fabricated from the prepreg and tested to determine optimum process conditions. The study showed that a very uniform and flexible prepeg with up to 50 percent by volume polymer could be produced with this powder coating system. The coating line minimized powder loss and produced prepeg in lengths of up to 300 m. The fiber spreading was found to have a major effect on the coating uniformity and flexibility. Though test results showed low composite tensile strengths, analysis of fracture surfaces under scanning electron microscope indicated that fiber/matrix adhesion was adequate...|$|E

Baris Presi is common throughout {{northern and southern}} Bali. Baris Dadap, however, was limited in range by the 1980s. Dancers are not accompanied by an orchestra, but sing songs regarding wayang during performances; this dance is generally performed during cremation ceremonies or temple festivals (dewayadnya).|$|R

Some groups dance to Western pop or even waltzes, but most choose Chinese popular songs with a dance beat, such as the 2014 hit [...] "Little Apple", or older hits from the 1950s, often with propagandist lyrics.

50|$|The term Perizoma Group {{describes}} {{a group of}} Attic black-figure vase painters and a type of vase. They lived approximately 600 B.C.E.The group is named after the perizoma (loincloth) worn by many figures on vases painted by it, especially athletes, <b>armed</b> <b>dancers</b> and symposiasts. The group often painted stamnoi, a vase shape introduced to Athens around 520 BC. The drawing style of the small group is considered as highly distinctive. Its figures, especially athletes, often appear rather weak. Apart from stamnoi, they painted single-handled kantharoi, resembling Etruscan shapes and likely aimed for export to that area.|$|R
50|$|A chorus {{dressed as}} satyrs and sileni {{followed}} the <b>armed</b> <b>dancers</b> and mocked them. They were costumed in woolly tunics, garlands {{of different kinds}} of flowers, and goatskin loincloths, with their hair standing out on their heads in tufts. The appearance of satyristai at the original Ludi Romani is the earliest known reference to satyrs in Roman culture. Although Dionysius suggests that both the war dances and the Bacchic dancing were in imitation of the Greeks, the armed dances had a Roman precedent in the Salian priests, who danced with sword and shield, {{and the role of the}} satyrs seems based on Etruscan custom.|$|R

On Crete, Zeus was represented in art as a long-haired youth rather than a mature adult, and hymned as ho megas kouros [...] "the great youth". Ivory statuettes of the [...] "Divine Boy" [...] were unearthed near the Labyrinth at Knossos by Sir Arthur Evans. With the Kouretes, a band of ecstatic <b>armed</b> <b>dancers,</b> he presided over the rigorous military-athletic training and secret rites of the Cretan paideia.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{introduce}} the main features of the <b>armed</b> <b>dancers</b> in Greek and Roman world. In the first part of this paper we shall present some characters of the Greek mythology connected with apotropaic dance with shields and swords (Kouretes and Korybantes), involved in the birth-stories of Zeus and Dionysos. The next step of this analysis is to show the cultic context of the Pyrrhic dance and to define his meaning in the greek religion. The second part of the article concerns, more specifically, the representation of Salii dance in Roman world. This ritual is known by literary descriptions and epigraphic sources,but its iconographical and archaeological evidence is controversial. This apparent dichotomy is interpreted by a socio-cultural perspective...|$|R
50|$|Argentine tango dancing {{consists}} {{of a variety of}} styles that developed in different regions and eras and in response to the crowding of the venue and even the fashions in clothing. It is danced in an embrace that can vary from very open, in which the <b>dancers</b> connect at <b>arms</b> length, to very closed, in which the connection is chest-to-chest, or anywhere in between. Styles of dance are not predefined by the embrace itself and many figures of tango salon style are danced in an open embrace, it is also possible to dance tango nuevo in close V-shape embrace. The milonguero (apilado) style is an exception; its close embrace without V-shape and emphasis on maintaining this embrace throughout the dance predetermines range of possible movements and their shape.|$|R
50|$|Originally, all ludi seem to {{have been}} votive offerings (ludi votivi), staged as the {{fulfillment}} of a vow to a deity whose favor had been sought and evidenced. In 366 BC, the Ludi Romani became the first games to be placed on the religious calendar as an annual event sponsored by the state as a whole. Games in the circus were preceded by a parade (pompa circensis) featuring the competitors, mounted youths of the Roman nobility, <b>armed</b> <b>dancers,</b> musicians, a satyr chorus, and images of the gods. As the product of military victory, ludi were often connected to triumphs. The first recorded venatio (staged beast hunt) was presented in 186 BC by M. Fulvius Nobilior as part of his ludi votivi, for which he paid with booty displayed at his triumph.|$|R
50|$|The final {{real change}} that {{occurred}} in the electronic tutus before they evolved into another form completely was the inclusion of the radio receivers. These receivers were powered by solar panels, going back towards Maubrey’s original ideas, and these receivers picked up radio waves by the way that the dancers positioned their bodies in sunlight. These solar panels were attached to the <b>dancer’s</b> head and <b>arms.</b> The difference between this edition of the solar powered tutu and the first rendition of it is that by using radio waves, the dancer could pick up actual radio stations and white noise. Thus, the environment is not the only collaborator with the dancer but instead, the light itself, when partnered with radio waves, becomes a dance partner that the dancer has to react to and work with.|$|R
