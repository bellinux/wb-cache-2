5|$|Though most of {{the routes}} {{proposed}} over the decades <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> construction, discussion remains strong to develop some of these lines, to alleviate existing subway capacity constraints and overcrowding, the most notable being the proposals for the Second Avenue Subway. Plans for new lines {{date back to the}} early 1910s, and expansion plans have been proposed during many years of the system's existence.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for grapheme-color synesthesia comes {{also from}} the finding that colors can be {{flexibly}} associated to graphemes, as new meanings become assigned to those graphemes. In one study synesthetes were presented with Glagolitic letters that they <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> before, and the meaning was acquired through a short writing exercise. The Glagolitic graphemes inherited {{the colors of the}} corresponding Latin graphemes as soon as the Glagolitic graphemes acquired the new meaning.|$|E
5|$|Satchel {{was easier}} to catch. He could throw it in a quart cup. But Rogan {{was all over the}} plate—high, low, inside, outside. He'd walk five-six men, but he didn't give up many runs. Bullet had a little more steam on the ball than Paige—and he had a better-breaking curve. The batters thought it was a fastball heading for them and they would jump back from the plate and all of a sudden, it would break sharply for a strike. I would rank him with today's best. I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> a pitcher like him, and I have caught some of the best {{pitchers}} in the business.|$|E

5|$|In Kansas City, Kansas, two {{religious}} missionaries visit {{two women}} at two different {{homes in the}} same neighborhood who look exactly alike. The second woman yells at them to go away and the two men, inexplicably, get into a fight in the second woman's front yard. Later, two FBI agents who look and sound remarkably similar to Mulder and Scully visit the first woman, Betty Templeton (Kathy Griffin). Betty claims to <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> the other woman before. The other woman then passes her by in a car and the two agents begin fighting each other, much like the missionaries. They are severely injured after the gruesome mauling. Both agents, who had worked together for seven years, said that they were possessed. Meanwhile, the other woman, Lulu Pfeiffer (also Kathy Griffin), applies for a job at Koko's Copies, but does not get it because she has had 17 jobs in 17 states {{in the past three years}} and moves around too much. She becomes aggravated and suddenly, all the copies become black. The other woman, Betty, goes to another job with the same name and same resume.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of remarks against India in Western media, Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US {{commentators}} exhibit a double standard in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder {{was a turning point}} in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India {{at the time of the}} rape and murder and that after having worked every day of my life for the last 15 years on sexual violence, I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> anything like that, where sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the centre of every discourse, in the centre of the college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. They are looking at sexual education. They are looking at the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.|$|E

25|$|Queen Street {{is known}} by {{reputation}} {{all over the}} country, even by people who <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> it. It gives {{its name to the}} most expensive square in the New Zealand version of Monopoly and to a somewhat disrespectful description of business people with rural investment interests (but lacking farming expertise): 'Queen Street farmers'. The street was immortalised by The Front Lawn with their song (It started on) Queen Street.|$|E
25|$|I {{must say}} that in all my conversations with you...during the last nine months I have never uttered one word of untruth. This is borne out {{absolutely}} by the record. In all my fifty years of public service I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> a document that was more crowded with infamous falsehoods and distortions--infamous falsehoods and distortions on a scale so huge that I never imagined until today that any Government on this planet was capable of uttering them.|$|E

25|$|Canal Street on the Main Line {{has four}} tracks and two side platforms. Only the outer local tracks, provide through service via the Montague Street Tunnel. The center tracks, which <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> revenue service, {{begin at the}} unused lower level of City Hall and run north to here, dead-ending at bumper blocks {{about two-thirds of the}} way through. The center tracks can be used for layups, but this use has been {{completely}} made redundant with the nearby City Hall lower level being used as a layup yard instead.|$|E
25|$|On arriving, both Sir Ethais and Sir Phyllon {{immediately}} {{suspect the}} other {{of some kind of}} wizardry, and they start fighting. The fairies, who <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> combat, believe it is a game. Sir Ethais is wounded in the arm. When the fairies step forward, the two knights are immediately taken with their beauty, and agree to stop fighting. The fairies, too, are immediately smitten with the men. Selene explains that the fairies wish to teach them how to live good and pure lives, while commenting in an aside how attractive they are. The men vow immediately to reform their sinful ways, taking tutelage from the fairies.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} methods that {{successfully}} investigate sentence processing, {{some of which}} include eye tracking, self-paced listening and reading, or cross-modal priming. The most productive method however, is real-time grammaticality judgements. A grammaticality judgement is a test which involves showing participants sentences that are either grammatical or ungrammatical. The participant must {{decide whether or not}} they find the sentences to be grammatical as quickly as possible. Grammaticality is cross-linguistic, so this method has therefore be used on a wide variety languages Grammaticality judgements are largely based on an individuals linguistic intuition, and it has been pointed out that humans have the ability to understand as well as produce an infinitely large number of new sentences that that <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> before. This allows us to accurately judge a sentence grammatical or ungrammatical, even if it a completely novel sentence.|$|E

25|$|In 1991, former Miss Virginia USA Tai Collins {{claimed to}} have {{had an affair with}} Robb seven years earlier, {{although}} her allegations were never corroborated and she offered no proof of the affair to reporters. Robb denied having an affair with her, merely admitting to sharing a bottle of champagne and receiving a massage from her in his hotel room on one occasion. Soon after making the allegations, Collins earned an undisclosed amount for posing nude for Playboy magazine. There were also rumors that during the time he was governor, Robb was present at parties in Virginia Beach where cocaine was used. These rumors were never proven, despite intense investigation by reporters and political operatives. He strongly denied this when the issue was raised during his 1988 campaign for the U.S. Senate. Robb so vehemently denied the cocaine allegation that he claimed to <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> cocaine.|$|E
25|$|The most heated {{controversy}} {{was over}} {{the status of the}} Catholic Church. From a dominant position in 1788, it was almost destroyed in less than a decade, its priests and nuns turned out, its leaders dead or in exile, its property controlled by its enemies, and a strong effort underway to remove all influence of Christian religiosity, such as Sundays, holy days, saints, prayers, rituals and ceremonies. The movement to dechristianise France not only failed but aroused a furious reaction among the pious. Napoleon's Concordat was a compromise that restored some of the Catholic Church's traditional roles but not its power, its lands or its monasteries. Priests and bishops were given salaries as part of a department of government controlled by Paris, not Rome. Protestants and Jews gained equal rights. Battles over {{the role of religion in}} the public sphere, and closely related issues such as church-controlled schools, that were opened by the Revolution <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> closure. They raged into the 20th century. By the 21st century, angry debates exploded over the presence of any Muslim religious symbols in schools, such as the headscarves for which Muslim girls could be expelled. J. Christopher Soper and Joel S. Fetzer explicitly link the conflict over religious symbols in public to the French Revolution, when the target was Catholic rituals and symbols.|$|E
