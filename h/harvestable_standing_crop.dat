40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{harvest of}} algae in Eastern Canada {{has been active}} for over 50 years. Benthic ecology studies by the 1950 ’s had {{established}} {{the value of the}} algal thallus and algal populations as habitats for many species of animals. However, for the first 35 years of marine plant harvests the primary concern of resource scientists was the sustainability of the resource. The incidental removal (bycatch) of non-targeted species was recognized by fisheries managers in the Chondrus crispus Stackhouse (Irish Moss) harvest but bycatch limits were {{not a part of the}} management plans. The implications of removing algal biomass and the potential of changing the structure of the algal habitat were only recently realized and integrated in resource management plans. A managed Ascophyllum nodosum L. Le Jolis harvest removes 17 % of the <b>harvestable</b> <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> and less than 7. 5 % of the total biomass. In terms of the total productivity of attached macrophytes in the Bay of Fundy ecosystem this is less than 1 % removals. In general the degree of complexity of an algal thallus is directly related to invertebrate abundance on a per unit biomass basis Ascophyllum nodosum harvests can change the relative spatial distribution of the biomass and the complexity of the plant structure. However harvesting is not homogeneous and hence, it increased the patchiness in the habitat. At an exploitation rate of 17 % it was not possible to detect changes in the structure of A. nodosum beds at a landscape scale. Precautionary management measures incorporated in the management plan for this harvest has made it a model in coastal zone management...|$|E
40|$|We {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that herbivore foraging efficiency is low at high plant <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> compared with intermediate levels, which is contrary to conventional theory. Captive barnacle geese were allowed to forage on fields dominated by Festuca rubra. Fields {{of high and low}} Festuca biomass were selected, and half of them were mown to reduce plant <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> artificially. In accordance with our hypothesis, we found that mean short-term intake rate was lowest in vegetation of high <b>standing</b> <b>crop.</b> Daily food intake tended to be lowest at high plant <b>standing</b> <b>crop,</b> but differences were not significant. Despite differences in food intake, we were unable to detect any effect of plant <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> on body mass change of geese. Festuca <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> proved to be a poor predictor of either daily intake or mean short-term Food intake. Data were best explained by Festuca cover. We therefore conclude that not Festuca plant <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> per se, but the actual cover of the forage is of primary importance for grazing geese.

40|$|The {{postulated}} {{relationship between}} eutrophication, enhanced <b>standing</b> macrophyte <b>crop</b> and flow impedance was assessed in 14 rivers across the UK. We sampled the July <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> of Ranunculus subgenus Batrachium at 14 rivers across England and southern Scotland, at sites {{where there is}} a known relationship between <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> and flow impedance. We relate <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> to variation in carbon concentrations and to elevated phosphorus concentrations, using regression analysis. <b>Standing</b> <b>crop</b> increased significantly with P availability as soluble reactive phosphorus (filtered SRP) and total phosphorus (TP). Best subsets multiple regression analysis suggests that, based on this sample of sites, there is evidence that macrophyte biomass increases with SRP concentrations and also increases with the amount of carbon as HCO 3 for a given concentration of SRP in the water. Thus eutrophication is found to increase the <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> of a submerged aquatic plant in UK rivers.

40|$|Currently {{there is}} very little basin-scale {{information}} on patterns of <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> in marine organisms or their structuring forces. Understanding modern patterns and controls on foraminifera is particularly critical because of their abundance and importance in benthic systems as well as their role as palaeoceanographic proxies. Here, we examine for the first time basin-scale patterns and predictors of benthic foraminiferal <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> from shelf to abyssal deep sea in the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent seas using a large database of 967 quantitative samples. Spatial regression analyses reveal that the flux of particulate organic matter (POC) is a major control on <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> size across all depths investigated, with increasing food supply increasing foraminiferal <b>standing</b> <b>crops.</b> Other factors also play a role. Dissolved oxygen is significant at slope depths and negatively related to <b>standing</b> <b>crop.</b> Temperature and possibly salinity are significant factors in the abyss. Dissolved silicate was important and positively related to <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> in shelf seas, potentially indicating the importance {{of the nature of the}} organic material available. This study demonstrates that productivity is important in describing foraminiferal <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> at a basin scale, supporting the use of paleoceanographic proxies, but also demonstrates that other environmental variables are also likely important in controlling the <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> and should be considered in reconstruction of Earth’s past marine environment...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{potential}} role of light limitation in the regulation of phytoplankton <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> in Florida’s largest river, the St. Johns. We hypothesized that spatial and temporal patterns in <b>standing</b> <b>crops</b> of phytoplankton are strongly affected by variations in light availability in the mixed layer, particularly {{as they relate to}} river basin morphology and changes in water color, which reach high levels in the St. Johns River. This hypothesis was examined within the context of four principal research objectives: (1) Determination of the spatial and temporal patterns of phytoplankton <b>standing</b> <b>crops</b> and key environmental parameters related to nutrient concentration and light extinction, (2) Estimation of spatial and temporal patterns of mean light availability in the mixed-layer, (3) Examination of the correlations between phytoplankton <b>standing</b> <b>crops</b> and light availability, and (4) Evaluation of the relative role of different limiting factors on the regulation of phytoplankton <b>standing</b> <b>crop.</b> The results of this study revealed a relationship between <b>standing</b> <b>crops</b> and light availability.

Using data from published studies, we derived the relationship between waterfowl density and reduction in plant <b>standing</b> <b>crop.</b> When waterfowl density was estimated as individuals ha− 1 no significant relationship with reduction in plant <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> was detected. However, when waterfowl density was estimated as kg ha− 1 a significant, positive, linear relationship with reduction in plant <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> was found. Whilst many previous studies have considered waterfowl species as homologous, despite large differences in body mass, our results suggest that species body mass is a key determinant of waterfowl impact on plant <b>standing</b> <b>crop.</b> To examine relative impacts of waterfowl groups based on species body mass, a measure of plant biomass reduction (Rs) per bird per hectare was calculated for each group. Comparison of Rs values indicated some differences in impact between different waterfowl groups, with swans having a greater per capita impact than smaller-bodied waterfowl groups. We present evidence that this difference is linked to disparities in individual body size and associated differences in intake rates, diet composition and energy requirements.

In this study, we conducted in situ field measurements for root production, mortality, and <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> in Inner Mongolia steppe under both ungrazed and heavily intensified grazed conditions using the improved rhizotron techniques. Our results showed that root production and mortality in the steppe displayed seasonal dynamic patterns, whereas no clear seasonal dynamic patterns for the standing cropwere detected. Long-termheavily intensified grazing did not alter seasonal dynamic patterns of root production, mortality and <b>standing</b> <b>crop.</b> Root production, mortality and <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> distributed in different soil layers responded to livestock grazing differently.

The grazing-induced reduction in root production, mortality and <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> was mainly accounted for by reductions in aboveground biomass and soil water contents.

40|$|Predicting {{diversity}} {{is a central}} theme of ecology. In this thesis, two aspects of diversity were explored, number of vegetation types and species richness. In the first chapter, I {{examined the relationship between}} number of vegetation types and <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> in wetlands. Fifteen individually homogeneous wetland sites which represented a broad <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> gradient were sampled in eastern Canada. There appears to be an inverse relationship between number of vegetation types and <b>standing</b> <b>crop.</b> In chapter 2, I investigated the relationship between species richness and <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> at two levels of organization: the among vegetation types level and the within vegetation type level. The results indicated that the model of species richness proposed by Grime had predictive power at a coarse-grained level of organization, among vegetation types, but did not survive the transition to a finer-grained level of organization, the within vegetation type level. Therefore, the higher level processes which structure species richness patterns among vegetation types are not the same processes that determine richness patterns within a vegetation type. Numerous forces, abiotic or biotic, can maintain or alter vegetation states and species richness at different levels of organization. In the third chapter, I tested whether these "assembly forces" had the potential to duplicate the patterns observed in chapters 1 and 2 in a large microcosm experiment. Chapter 4 investigated the effects of a disturbance involving the complete removal of above ground vegetation in five wetlands of varying <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> found on the Ottawa River. The results indicated that the wetland <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> gradient and the diversity patterns observed along this gradient were likely the result of an underlying natural disturbance gradient. In chapter 5, I considered the results from chapters 1 to 4 with regards to the conservation value, potential threats, and proper management techniques for wetlands, particularly for low <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> wetlands. In addition to the fifteen wetlands surveyed in chapter 1, additional low <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> wetland sites from the Georgian Bay area in Ontario and the Tusket River Valley in Nova Scotia were surveyed. The results revealed that low <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> wetlands had many more nationally rare species than did high <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> wetlands, in addition to the higher species richness and higher number of vegetation types discussed above. The results of the microcosm experiment revealed that low <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> wetlands may be severely threatened by eutrophication and by an invasive Eurasian weed, Lythrum salicaria. In each of the five wetland sites examined in the field experiment, L. salicaria exhibited dramatic increases in abundance over the three year observation period. Further, the disturbance treatment at each site did not slow the invasion of L. salicaria, but instead increased the rate of invasion in at least one site. I conclude that low <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> wetlands, despite their high conservation value, are severely threatened and must be protected from the effects of eutrophication and invasion by Lythrum salicaria.

40|$|Abstract Nectar <b>standing</b> <b>crops</b> in flowers {{within an}} {{individual}} plant are often highly variable. This variability {{may be a}} by-product of the foraging activity of insect pollinators. Alternatively, plants may be selected to pro-duce highly variable rewards to reduce consecutive visitation by risk-averse pollinators, thus diminishing within-plant pollen transfer. This study evaluated the roles of pollinator control vs. plant control over nectar variability in the bee-pollinated shrub Rosmarinus officinalis L. (Lamiaceae). We sampled nectar production, <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> and pollinator visits in three shrubs of one population over 17 days during one blooming season. Nectar pro-duction rates were highly variable (CV = 1. 48), and increased after rainy days. Nectar <b>standing</b> <b>crops</b> were even more variable (CV = 2. 16), decreased with increasing temperatures, and increased with time since the last rain. Pollinator visit rates decreased with variability in nectar <b>standing</b> <b>crops,</b> increased with flower number per shrub, and were unaffected by variability in nectar production rates. Repeated sampling of marked flowers revealed no correlation between their nectar <b>standing</b> <b>crops</b> and pro-duction rates. These findings support the role of reward variance in reducing pollinator visits, but suggest that plants are not in complete control of this variability. Rather, plant-generated variability can be modified by intensive foraging activity of pollinators. Such pollinator control over nectar variability is likely to reduce the selective advantage of plant-generated reward variation...|$|R

As a consequence, continuously grazed swards are more suitable for feeding than temporarily ungrazed swards. We present a model showing that, for a dome-shaped functional response, optimal foraging under increasing primary productivity leads to spatial heterogeneity in <b>standing</b> <b>crop.</b> Beyond a certain threshold value, a further increase in productivity leads to a progressive release of vegetation from herbivore control and {{to the development of a}} high <b>standing</b> <b>crop.</b> Interestingly, our model suggests that only in a stable and predictable environment the aggregative behaviour of herbivores is able to maintain the intake rate close to its potential maximum. Misjudgement of patch quality by the herbivore or any other process disrupting the match between local primary production and consumption leads to a less than optimal intake, as suitable vegetation becomes depleted. This has important implications for ecological inferences, such as the prediction of carrying capacities in herbivore-dominated ecosystems. ...|$|R
40|$|Converted to {{electronic}} format by Damon J. Gomez (NOAA/RSMAS) in 2002. Copy {{available at the}} NOAA Miami Regional Library. Minor editorial changes were made. ] The distribution and <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> of benthic algal species on a Caribbean algal ridge (St. Croix) and its associated carbonate pavements is discussed and contrasted with that of other eastern Caribbean algal ridges and a Pacific algal ridge. Mean <b>standing</b> <b>crops</b> of 3 kg/m 2 (wet weight) and a species richness of about 40 species (for ten 0. 25 m 2 samples) were encountered on St. Croix. Non-calcified or fleshy algae are greatly reduced in <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> with depth away from the high wave energy ridge crests and species richness increases. This is correlated with the greater grazing abilities of fish and invertebrates under less turbulent conditions. On reefs of typical lower eastern Caribbean islands, only where the force of water movement across intertidal algal ridges prevents intense grazing by fish and echinoids are general high levels of algal <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> and productivity developed. However, in the more eutrophic waters of higher islands and where wave action is greater, dense <b>standing</b> <b>crops</b> of larger fleshy algae can also extend sublittorally to depths of at least 10 meters. We suggest that the extensive filling of grazing niches in tropical reefs and a general retreat of plant tissues to protective carbonate structures has caused a reduction of primary productivity in typical reef environments...|$|R
40|$|Young-of-the-year {{northern}} and Florida largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides salmoides and M. s. floridanus) and spotted bass (M. punctulatus) were stocked in various ratios {{at a single}} density in small (mostly 0. 1 ha) Oklahoma ponds in each of two years. Samples of the bass were seined periodically and their size (weight) and food were estimated. Survival and <b>standing</b> <b>crops</b> were measured when ponds were drained. Mean weight of bass was generally greatest in polytypic ponds, but <b>standing</b> <b>crops</b> there were lower {{in one of the}} years owing to greater mortality. During one of the years, all three basses ate a wider variety of foods when stocked polytypically, although the total amount of food eaten did not vary. Two strain-specific differences appeared to be independent of the stocking combination: (a) survival of Florida largemouth bass was lower than that of northern largemouth bass, and (b) average weight, survival, <b>standing</b> <b>crop,</b> and diversity of diet were lower for spotted bass than for either subspecies of largemouth bass. Judging by total <b>standing</b> <b>crops</b> in the ponds, stocking of spotted bass appeared to be most promising for augmenting native populations of northern largemouth bass...|$|R
40|$|Nannoplankton and netplankton primary {{productivity}} and <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> were measured {{in a wide}} variety of neritic and oceanic environments in the eastern tropical Pacific and Caribbean region. Nannoplankters were the most important producers in all the environ-ments studied, but netplankton productivity was significantly (P = 0. 05) higher in neritic than in oceanic waters. Mean neritic netplankton-nannoplankton productivity and chloro-phyll ratios were 0. 50 + 0. 14 and 0. 62 -C 0. 22 respectively, significantly higher than those observed in oceanic waters. Relative levels of netplankton <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> and productivity were not systematically related to corresponding levels of {{primary productivity}} and <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> as a whole. The patterns of variation in the relative importance of netplankton and nannoplankton could be accounted for by the high netplankton growth rates and low grazing pressure indices observed in neritic as compared to oceanic waters...|$|R
40|$|Estimates of root <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> {{were made}} at {{approximately}} 3 -month intervals from two grassland communities each with three treatments. Roots were extracted {{to a depth of}} 0. 5 m using a corer and then separated from the soil by wet sieving and flotation. Peak <b>standing</b> <b>crops</b> of 4487 gm− 2 and 4737 gm− 2 for the two communities respectively, in autumn or early winter, were high relative to previously published figures. Lowest <b>standing</b> <b>crops</b> were recorded in summer. Treatment effects were masked by the high variation of the data. These high yields gave rise to high root/shoot ratios, which were decreased with aging of the sward and grazing of the above-ground biomass. Turnover times of 2 – 3 years were recorded. The need for root-depth profiles to facilitate standardization of results between researchers is emphasized...|$|R
40|$|The benthic {{environment}} and fauna of Lake Turkana were studied during 1978 - 1979 to determine distri-bution patterns and associations of benthic invertebrates. Lake Turkana is a large, closed-basin, alkaline lake, located in northern Kenya. Detailed environmental information is currently only available for substrate variations throughout Lake Turkana. Water chemistry {{and other data}} are currently inadequate to evaluate their effects {{on the distribution of}} Lake Turkana benthic invertebrates. Three weak faunal-substrate associations were discovered at Turkana. A littoral, soft bottom association (large <b>standing</b> <b>crop)</b> is dominated by the corixid Micronecta sp. and the ostracod Hemicypris kliei. A littoral, rocky bottom association, also with a large <b>standing</b> <b>crop,</b> is dominated by various gastropods and insects.

40|$|<b>Standing</b> <b>crop</b> {{and species}} {{composition}} in semiarid grassland {{are linked to}} long-term patterns of water availabil-ity, but grasslands are characterized by large single-season variability in rainfall. We tested whether a single sea-son of altered water availability influenced the proportions of grasses and shrubs in a semiarid grassland near {{the northern edge of}} the North American Great Plains. We studied stands of the clonal shrub snowberry Symphori-carpos occidentalis and adjacent grassland dominated by the native grasses Stipa spartea and Bouteloua graci-lis. Rain was excluded and water supplied in amounts corresponding to years of low, medium, and high rainfall, producing a 2 4 -fold range in monthly precipitation among water supply treatments. There were ten replicate plots of each water treatment in both snowberry stands and grassland. Grass <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> increased significantly with water availability in grassland but not inside snowberry stands. Total <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> and shrub stem density increased significantly with water supply, averaged across both communities. In contrast, water had no effect on shrub <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> or light penetration. In summary, our finding that water has significant effects on a subset of components of grassland vegetation is consistent with long-term, correlational studies, but we also found that a single season of altered water supply had no effect on other important aspects of the ecosystem...|$|R

40|$|Qualities and {{quantities}} of parameters composing the bog systems in Northeast Arkansas {{are not entirely}} reflective of those defining bogs of the northern United States. While pH is restricting to the organisms of each bog studied (4. 8 - 6. 9), the major limiting factor {{is the amount of}} available water. Three acidophilic bogs with shallow water depths (2 - 30 cm) yielded a total of 75 aquatic macroinvertebrate taxa. The bog with greatest surface area supported 67 taxa and a mean numerical <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> of 14 organisms/ 2 hr sampling period. The bog with the smallest surface area had 13 taxa and a mean <b>standing</b> <b>crop</b> of 2 organisms/ 2 hr sampling period.
