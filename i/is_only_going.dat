25|$|The {{success of}} a new racino at Aqueduct Racetrack led to a {{proposal}} from Governor Andrew Cuomo to build a massive convention center in the vicinity. Talks of reactivating the line were publicly endorsed in February 2012 by Assemblymen Phillip Goldfeder and Michael G. Miller. Goldfeder commented “The commute for people here <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>going</b> to go from bad to worse. You can’t talk about a convention center without talking about transportation.” Goldfeder and Miller said they are not opposed to turning sections of the line into a park named Queensway, but said {{people who live in}} Rockaway, Ozone Park, Howard Beach, and other areas along the right-of-way have no quick or easy way to get into Manhattan. The Genting Group, which operates the racino and has been asked to construct the convention center, was evaluating several plans to increase transportation access, and was committed to paying for part of the transportation improvements. Queensway advocates are against resumption of rail service, stating that current bus service fills current transportation needs in the area.|$|E
500|$|Other themes {{prevalent}} in the episode include Lori's pregnancy. After getting into a heated argument, Rick reveals to Shane about her pregnancy. Although he didn't question who the biological father was, Robert Kirkman felt that Rick was [...] "smart {{enough to know that}} the kid's either his or Shane's and there may not be any way of ever finding out that definitively." [...] He continued: [...] "Bringing that up to his wife, who he loves, <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>going</b> to be painful for her. I think that’s him being a good husband and him showing his tremendous leadership ability in that he can put his self aside for the betterment of someone else." ...|$|E
500|$|The Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) {{abandoned}} the Rockaway Beach Branch in 1962, {{and ever since}} it has been sought after for reactivation for train service. The line hasn't been reactivated due to local opposition, specifically the homeowners who live along the right-of-way. One group wants the line's reactivation for transit service. A second group would use the right-of-way as a linear park, known as the Queensway, a proposal inspired {{by the success of}} the High Line in Manhattan. The final group involving homeowners would have nothing done, keeping the line as is. Most plans call for the line to be used for subway service, with the line being connected to the south with the IND Rockaway Line. Talks of reactivating the line were publicly endorsed in February 2012 by Assemblymen Phillip Goldfeder and Michael G. Miller. Goldfeder commented [...] "The commute for people here <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>going</b> to go from bad to worse. You can’t talk about a convention center without talking about transportation."

Congressmen Hakeem Jeffries and Gregory Meeks added their support for the project in March 2013. Both representatives will push to allocate federal transportation subsidies to study a plan for restored passenger service.|$|E

2500|$|Theodore Modis says [...] "nothing {{in nature}} follows a pure exponential" [...] and {{suggests}} the logistic function {{is a better}} fit for [...] "a real growth process". The logistic function looks like an exponential at first but then tapers off and flattens completely. For example world population and the United States's oil production both appeared to be rising exponentially, but both have leveled off because they were logistic. Kurzweil says [...] "the knee in the curve" [...] {{is the time when}} the exponential trend is going to explode, while Modis claims if the process is logistic when you hit the [...] "knee" [...] the quantity you are measuring <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>going</b> to increase by a factor of 100 more.|$|E
2500|$|Over the 2000–2001 winter Glover {{played in}} the Venezuelan Winter League, where he and former SkyChiefs {{teammate}} John Bale were robbed by {{a man with a}} shotgun. Unfazed, Glover finished out the season in Venezuela, commenting that the experience made him realize that [...] "this game <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>going</b> to be kind to you for so many years, so you've got {{to try to make the}} best of the game when you're in it." [...] Glover opened the [...] and got off to a strong start; retiring the first sixteen hitters he faced and picking up his first major league victory on April 11 in relief of Jim Parque against Cleveland. After a rocky May Chicago demoted Glover to the Triple-A Charlotte Knights, but he returned to the team in mid-June after posting a 1.88 ERA in six starts. On July 27 Glover made his first career major league start in place of the just-traded James Baldwin; like his debut and first win, it came against the Cleveland Indians. Glover allowed two hits in 3 innings but did not figure in the decision. Glover finished out the year at Chicago with a 5–5 record and a 4.93 ERA in 46 appearances, including 11 starts.|$|E

Yes, doubtless, for those (saith he) 'are of an indispensable, and eternal obligation, which were first written in men's hearts, and originally dictates of human nature' (p. 8). Mark, not a dictate of human nature, or necessary conclusion or deduction from it, is of an indifferent, but of an indispensable; not of a transient, but of an eternal obligation.

"Frequent" [...] is a {{cautious}} word, in this author's mouth; the very cautiousness of it, the vagueness of it, provokes suspicion; it makes one suspect that this frequency was more frequent than the mere common everyday kinds of frequency {{which one is}} {{in the habit of}} averaging up with the unassuming term [...] "frequent."

Lady Battledown makes all her governesses take the same name; she gives £5 more a year for the purpose.

Governesses shouldn’t have too pretty a name—they shouldn’t have a nicer name than the family.|$|E
