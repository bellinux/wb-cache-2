Developmental concerns were central to the debates raised at the meeting and remained central in deliberations in Geneva. The article analyses Africa’s participation and considers the gains resulting from the Summit and explores the prospects for implementation of the Plan of Action at country level.

Therefore, he liberalisation fo telecommunicetions to increase competition and reduce its price was very important fro making the base of the Europe 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Information</b> <b>Society,</b> so called, eEurope. 　The liberalisation of telecommunication in Europe was started by the European Commission in 1987 with the publication of Green Paper {{on the development of the}} common market for communications services and equipment. The telecommunicetions regulatory process was expanded by the European Commission. At last, the European telecommunications markets were fully liberalised in 1998. 　We should consider the telecommunications regulatory process was part of the wider process of the economic integration and <b>Information</b> <b>Society</b> <b>Initiative</b> of Europe.

40|$|The {{concept of}} ITCA has {{grown out of}} the need to wrap a {{framework}} around the growing number of mandates and ICT related outreach activities and the opportunity to reach the approximately 18, 000 conference participants that pass through ECA's Conference Center (UNCC) to attend over 1500 events annually. As expressed in Figure 1 below, this number is due to expand over the years. The ITCA which is located in the UNCC was initially conceived as a way of delivering demonstrations, exhibits (permanent and rotating) and training about the application of ICT to development management. The intention was to provide these services both to ECA and non-ECA sponsored conferences at the UNCC in the framework of the African <b>Information</b> <b>Society</b> <b>Initiative</b> (AISI) which was adopted in 1996 by the African Ministers in charge of economic and social development and planning. AISI is an action framework to build Africa's information and communication infrastructure. It is a mission statement for Africa's quest to narrow the information technology gap between Africa {{and the rest of the}} world, and to speed the continent's entry into the information age. ITCA is a response under the AISI framework. It is mainly focused on enhancing the awareness and commitment of African policy makers in assuming leadership and championing the diffusion and utilization of ICTs to development endeavors in Africa. This will open up significant new markets for ICT products and services throughout Africa, even in the medium term, which will further accelerate the continent's socio-economic development and growth...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to establish the case that {{information and communication technologies}} have to be understood as the backbone of a community knowledge infrastructure underpinning the learning community. Measurement of success is of central relevance to this work. The predominant model for measurement in {{the first phase of the}} current societal change has centred around quantitative outcomes. This thesis starts from the premise that this model is no longer adequate and that new measures must be identified. This stance is justified by looking at a theoretical level at the current societal change. There is recognition of the cross-sectoral nature of ICT as an enabling mechanism for development and for decision-making. This thesis focuses on a rural community. It is in rural areas that technology has been most forcefully presented as a ‘deterministic’ solution to disadvantage. In line with the concepts of reflexive modernity, the fieldwork undertaken works out from the key agents of development at the local level in the study region. Evidence is gathered on the meanings and importance attached to information and communications technology in regional development. This then is triangulated, validated quantitatively and matched with wider evidence gathered from local community groups. Concrete actions are proposed for the study region. The policy context forms an important backcloth lo the fieldwork and so an analysis is done of <b>Information</b> <b>Society</b> <b>Initiatives</b> and Rural Development Policy. The findings of two recent evaluative studies are taken into account. In this thesis the argument is made that community informatics may best be understood as a group support system promoting a collective agenda, increasing creativity whilst preserving community identity. A Community Knowledge Cone is derived and proposed as a model for the measurement of progress towards a knowledge-based community and consideration is given to appropriate performance indicators...|$|R

40|$|This dilemma was {{the theme}} of CTA´s Observatory on ICTs, on Gender and Agriculture in the <b>Information</b> <b>Society,</b> in Wageningen, the Netherlands on 11 - 13 September 2002. The meeting called on CTA and other {{agencies}} to include a gender perspective and mainstream gender in all their programmes to promote ICTs for agricultural innovation and rural development in ACP countries. Work on gender and development policies and programmes has shown that adopting a gender perspective improves the efficient use of resources and empowers resource-poor rural women. ICTs have created many opportunities for women through awareness raising, education and skills training, and income generation. Some examples of gender-friendly initiatives to promote ICTs in agriculture and rural development {{are listed in the}} section Projects of this web magazine. The adoption of a gender focus implies changes in development institutions and social structures that will not occur quickly or easily by themselves. The aim is to ensure positive outcomes that will benefit not only resource-poor rural women, but the whole of society. Gender mainstreaming helps to ensure that both men and women have equal opportunities to participate in and to benefit from development activities. In addressing the constraints and obstacles to gender equity, solutions may include providing single-sex training and access for women who are uncomfortable using technology in settings with men, or remedying the lack of education and skills of many rural women to enable them to use ICTs. Gender mainstreaming means applying gender analysis to programmes, projects and activities from their inception, and not as add-ons. Most programmes and projects do not consider gender as an important design component and, consequently, fail to include both men and women equitably. In the area of ICTs for agriculture and rural development {{it is almost impossible to}} find a gender-neutral project, i. e. one that affects and benefits both men and women in the same way. As with nearly all technologies employed in development processes, ICTs impact men and women differently. Yet men and women have different needs. As noted by the OECD, in the agricultural sector, strategies that assume gender neutrality ("for the benefit of the community as a whole") do not necessarily lead to gender-neutral outcomes. As the specialists from ACP and other countries observed, "gender is everywhere; it is a matter of recognizing it and acting appropriately".
