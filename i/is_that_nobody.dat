500|$|In May 1928, the KCA {{launched}} a Kikuyu-language magazine, Muĩgwithania (roughly translated as [...] "The Reconciler" [...] or [...] "The Unifier"), {{in which it}} published news, articles, and homilies. Its purpose was to help unify the Kikuyu and {{to raise funds for}} the KCA. Kenyatta, now described as Secretary of the KCA, was listed as the publication's editor, although Murray-Brown suggested that he was not the guiding hand behind it and that his duties were largely confined to translating things into Kikuyu. Kenyatta's approach to campaigning was cautious; he was aware that Thuku had been exiled for his activism. In Muĩgwithania, he expressed support for the churches, district commissioners, and chiefs. He also praised the British Empire, stating that: [...] "The first thing [...] is that all people are governed justly, big or small – equally. The second thing <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> is regarded as a slave, everyone is free to do what he or she likes without being hindered." ...|$|E
2500|$|Terry Eagleton, a {{prominent}} British Marxist, excoriates Fish's [...] "discreditable epistemology" [...] as [...] "sinister." [...] According to Eagleton, [...] "Like almost all diatribes against universalism, Fish's critique of universalism {{has its own}} rigid universals: the priority at all times and places of sectoral interests, the permanence of conflict, the a priori status of belief systems, the rhetorical character of truth, {{the fact that all}} apparent openness is secretly closure, and the like." [...] Hence, Eagleton finds it inherently self-defeating. Of Fish's attempt to co-opt the critiques leveled against him, Eagleton responds, [...] "The felicitous upshot <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> can ever criticise Fish, since if their criticisms are intelligible to him, they belong to his cultural game and are thus not really criticisms at all; and if they are not intelligible, they belong to some other set of conventions entirely and are therefore irrelevant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing. The point <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> else {{seems to}} know anything. I merely wished {{to suggest that it}} might be well to be more cautious." ...|$|E
60|$|SYLVIA. It {{does need}} an explanation, doesn't it? The truth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody's</b> asked me.|$|R
50|$|In 1639, Grand Master Giovanni Paolo Lascaris {{issued a}} bando prohibiting women from wearing masks or {{participating}} in balls organised by the knights' auberges, on penalty of being publicly whipped. Another bando <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> could wear a costume {{to represent the}} devil.|$|R
5000|$|Jean Rollin {{explained}} in an interview: [...] "Le Viol {{was a terrible}} scandal here in Paris. People were really mad when they saw it. In Pigalle, they threw things at the screen. The principal reason <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> could understand the story".|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot tell you. It is something... I cannot say. The mournful thing <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> {{would admit}} it {{as a reason}} for feeling as I do; so that no excuse is left me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Violet laughed. [...] "The {{difficulty}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> {{can tell}} {{how much you}} really mean. You are so seldom serious." [...] She cast {{a quick glance at}} him. [...] "You were not like that when you first came here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There’s some questions," [...] said Stubbs slowly, [...] "as is {{best left}} unanswered. When you’ve seen as much law as I have, my lad, you’ll {{know that one}} of the first {{principles}} of English law <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> is bound to commit themselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{suggestions}} are plausible, but you can't seriously {{expect me to}} attach much weight to them," [...] Challoner said. [...] "Besides, {{you seem to have}} overlooked the important fact that at the regimental inquiry the verdict <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> in particular <b>was</b> to blame." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was eight}} {{o'clock in the}} evenin when this row took place; and such a row it <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> but me heard master's knock. He came in, and heard the hooping, and screeching, and roaring. He seemed very much frightened at first, and said, [...] "What is it?" ...|$|R
5000|$|When Butler interviewed McAllister decades later, he remarked, [...] "The {{conclusion}} I came to <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> {{had asked}} them. New Criticism {{was about the}} scholars and the text; writers were {{cut out of the}} equation. Scholars would talk about symbolism in writing, but no one had asked the writers." ...|$|R
6000|$|Flora Schuyler {{looked at}} them quietly. [...] "I fancy {{it would not be}} very {{difficult}} for Mr. Grant to get away, but the trouble <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> must know he has been near the place. That is the one thing your father could not forgive, Hetty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Colston, pulling himself together, {{though his}} manner was confused; [...] "there was one. I don't {{know how it}} happened--it was a {{surprise}} to us all. I don't think the pistol's safe; it goes off too easily. However, the most important thing <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> is hurt." ...|$|E
60|$|MITCHENER. No. For you {{now tell}} me that the Labor Party demands votes for women. That makes it {{impossible}} to give them, because it would be yielding to clamor. The one condition on which we can consent to grant anything in this country <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> shall presume to want it.|$|E
60|$|His only {{consolation}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> else, {{not even}} the fellows who worked their way right through the jam and got seats {{in the front row}} where they could glare into her eyes and hang on her lips and all that sort of thing, seemed to be making any better progress.|$|R
50|$|Trump's thoughts: Donald & Melania <b>were</b> embarrassed <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> on Team Power {{noticed the}} {{spelling}} slip-up <b>that</b> <b>was</b> on the advert.|$|R
50|$|Every {{citizen of}} Belarus can <b>be</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> will <b>be</b> allowed to destabilize, disrupt the {{sovereignty}} and {{territorial integrity of}} the country.|$|R
60|$|AUGUSTUS. The great {{advantage}} of being at war, madam, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> takes the slightest notice of the House of Commons. No doubt it is sometimes necessary for a Minister to soothe the more seditious members of that assembly by giving a pledge or two; but the War Office takes no notice of such things.|$|E
60|$|She {{rushed into}} his arms like someone {{charging}} in for a bowl of soup at a railway station buffet. And I drifted out. It {{seemed to me that}} this was a scene in which I was not on. I sidled to the door, and slid forth. They didn't notice me. My experience <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> ever does--much.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{now give}} me some account of your new clubs, new hotels, and new men.... What I was going to add, {{on the subject of}} finding out where your luck lies, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> is so unfortunate as not to have a lucky star in some {{direction}} or other. Perhaps yours is at the antipodes; if so, go there. All I say is, discover your lucky star.' ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Pennel smiled also; {{and it is}} to <b>be</b> remarked <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> ever {{mentioned}} the poor Captain's name without the same curious smile.|$|R
60|$|It <b>was</b> evident <b>that</b> the {{suggestion}} commended itself {{to all of}} them, but the trouble <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> seemed anxious {{to put it into}} execution. Carrie pressed down the magazine slide with one hand. It would, however, only move a very little, and she realised <b>that</b> the magazine <b>was</b> almost full. Then she laughed harshly, and the sound jarred on Eveline Annersly's ears.|$|R
50|$|However, he {{then said}} that the claimant’s {{difficulty}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> thought he <b>was</b> gay (at 23), so <b>that</b> the harassment <b>was</b> not on grounds of sexual orientation at all. It was a ‘vehicle for teasing the Claimant’ (at 24). He then said ‘without deciding the point, that the result may have been different on direct application of the Directive’.|$|R
6000|$|... "The truth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> {{out here}} can boast of having known him well," [...] said Davidson. [...] "He was a queer chap. I doubt if he himself knew how queer he was. But {{everybody}} {{was aware that}} I was keeping my eye on him in a friendly way. And that's how I got the warning which made me turn round in my tracks. In {{the middle of my}} trip and steam back to Samburan, where, I am grieved to say, I arrived too late." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Kit, rather dryly. [...] "I {{made some}} studies when I {{could get the}} books, but they didn't take me far. In fact, I imagine that in this {{neighborhood}} there's very little law and much precedent, which has generally been interpreted for the landlord's advantage. There are old Barony laws and Manor rights, and my notion <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> knows exactly how he stands. But we'll let this go. If Railton pays his fine, you will have some trouble {{to get rid of}} him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here {{his whole}} {{conversation}} consisted in quizzing (TURLUPINER) whatever he saw; and repeating to me, above {{a hundred times}} over, the words 'little Prince,' 'little Court.' I was shocked; and could not understand how he had changed so suddenly towards me. The etiquette of all Courts in the Empire <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> who has not at the least the rank of Captain can sit at a Prince's table: my Brother put a Lieutenant there, who was in his suite; saying to me, 'A King's Lieutenants {{are as good as}} a Margraf's Ministers.' I swallowed this incivility, and showed no sign.|$|E
50|$|The bodies {{brought to}} the surface were {{initially}} assessed and stored in the colliery's stable hayloft, that acted as a temporary morgue. Many were so badly mutilated <b>that</b> identification <b>was</b> virtually impossible, and there were several instances of corpses being carried to the wrong houses. Another source of confusion <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> knew {{the number of men}} below ground when the explosion occurred.|$|R
50|$|The Star: This card led to {{the song}} Vorübergehend geschlossen ("Temporarily closed"). Hannes Eyber wrote largely incomprehensible lyrics which were then {{electronically}} distorted on the album {{to the point of}} incomprehensibility. (In a remixed version released much later the lyrics can be made out.) The music is also written to sound alien. The idea behind it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> can grasp the stars.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{we want to}} <b>be</b> certain <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>is</b> around," [...] said Ham Spink. [...] "For if {{they caught}} us at it they would surely kill us." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{is not for}} us {{to discuss}} whether the {{breeding}} of Plato or Cicero or the Arabs of Cordova was better or worse than the breeding of the eastern bishops at Nicæa or Ephesus. Good manners, we may be sure, hardly have a single master-key, unless it be simplicity, or freedom from the curse of affectation. What is certain <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> of his time was a finer example of high good manners and genuine courtesy than Mr. Gladstone himself. He has left a little sheaf of random jottings which, without being subtle or recondite, show how he looked {{on this side of}} human things. Here is an example or two:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cats," [...] remarked Jephson to me, one afternoon, {{as we sat}} in the punt {{discussing}} the plot of our novel, [...] "cats are animals for whom I entertain a very great respect. Cats and Nonconformists seem to me the only things in this world possessed of a practicable working conscience. Watch a cat doing something mean and wrong--if ever one gives you the chance; notice how anxious she <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> should see her doing it; and how prompt, if detected, to pretend that she was not doing it--that she was not even thinking of doing it--that, as a matter of fact, she was just about to do something else, quite different. You might almost think they had a soul.|$|E
60|$|When {{he could}} find time, Mr. Morgan the butler came from the Park, and took a glass {{at the expense of}} the {{landlord}} of the Clavering Arms. He watched poor Lightfoot's tipsy vagaries with savage sneers. Mrs. Lightfoot felt always doubly uncomfortable when her unhappy spouse was under his comrade's eye. But a few months married, and to think he had got to this! Madame Fribsby could feel for her. Madame Fribsby could tell her stories of men every bit as bad. She had had her own woes too, and her sad experience of men. So it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> seems happy altogether; and that there's bitters, as Mr. Foker remarked, in the cup of every man's life. And yet there did not seem to be any in his, the honest young fellow! It was brimming over with happiness and good-humour.|$|E
25|$|The {{total number}} of baronetcies today is {{approximately}} 1,204, although only some 1,020 are on The Official Roll of the Baronetage. It is unknown whether some baronetcies remain extant and it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> can prove himself to be the actual heir. Over 200 baronetcies are now held by peers and others, such as the Knox line, have been made tenuous due to internal family dispute.|$|R
50|$|The idea of {{a virtual}} machine system had been bruited about a bit before then, but it had never really been implemented. The {{idea of a}} virtual S/360 was new, but what was really {{important}} about their concept <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> until then had seen how elegantly a virtual machine system could be built, with really very minor hardware changes and not much software.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have not. I felt I {{was forced}} to tell you, but it would <b>be</b> better <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> else should know. Florence, with whom Evelyn stayed, will not talk." ...|$|R
