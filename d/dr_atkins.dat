50|$|In 1972, Robert Atkins {{published}} <b>Dr.</b> <b>Atkins</b> Diet Revolution, which {{advocated the}} low-carbohydrate diet he had successfully used in treating {{patients in the}} 1960s (having developed the diet from a 1963 article published in JAMA). The book met with some success, but, because of research at that time suggesting risk factors associated with excess fat and protein, it was widely criticized by the mainstream medical community as being dangerous and misleading, thereby limiting its appeal at the time. Among other things, critics pointed out that Atkins had done little real research into his theories and based them mostly on his clinical work.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of overweight and obesity has increased steadily over past 30 years. The rapid spread of urbanization and industrialization and dramatic lifestyle changes that accompany these trends {{had led to}} pandemic of obesity, even in developing countries. The obesity has serious public health implications. Excess weight {{has been associated with}} mortality and morbidity. It is associated with cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, hypertension, stroke, gall bladder disease, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, respiratory problems and some types of cancer. Due to this reasons, weight loss is of major concern in today’s populations 1. Dietary recommendations are key element in management of obesity. In recent years, numerous dietary fads have emerged as a response to rising {{prevalence of}} obesity 2. Popular diets have become increasingly prevalent and controversial. Some popular diets are based on long-standing medical advice and recommend restriction of portion sizes and calories (e. g. weight watchers diet). A broad spectrum of alternatives have evolved. Some plans minimize carbohydrate intake without fat restriction e. g. Atkins ’ diet and many modulate macronutrient balance and glycemic load e. g. Zone diet and others restriction fat e. g. Ornish diet 3. TRADITIONAL DIETS Traditionally the strategy recommended by most medical groups for weight loss and weight maintenance was intake of low calorie low fat diet. The concept of fat restriction for weight management stems from traditional calorimetric measurements, which assigns greater energy value to fats (9 kcals/g) and less to carbohydrate and protein (4 kcals/g). The low calorie concept on other hand is a technique to induce negative energy balance. 2 CLASSIFICATION OF SOME POPULAR DIETS 1 1. High fat- low carbohydrate – high protein diets e. g. <b>Dr</b> <b>Atkins</b> new diet revolution, protein power, life without bread 2.
