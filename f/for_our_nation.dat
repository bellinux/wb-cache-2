On 31 October, the government decreed three days of national mourning, which was the first time in 15 years when three days of national mourning had been decreed in Romania. Halloween concerts and parties scheduled for that evening were cancelled across the country, and a campaign on Facebook urging people to avoid clubs and bars that night, and intended both to show respect to the victims and as a form of protest against inadequate safety precautions in such establishments, garnered over 100,000 supporters.|$|E
2500|$|In 1621, Philip III {{died and}} his son succeeded as Philip IV. The militarists now were firmly in charge. The {{following}} year, Zúñiga was replaced by Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares, an able man who believed that {{the center of all}} Spain's woes lay in Holland. After certain initial setbacks, the Bohemians were defeated at White Mountain in 1621, and again at Stadtlohn in 1623. The war with the Netherlands was renewed in 1621 with Spinola taking the fortress of Breda in 1625. The intervention of the Danish king Christian IV in the war worried some (Christian was one of Europe's few monarchs who had no worries over his finances) but the victory of the Imperial general Albert of Wallenstein over the Danes at Dessau Bridge and again at Lutter, both in 1626, eliminated the threat. There was hope in Madrid that the Netherlands might finally be reincorporated into the empire, and after the defeat of Denmark the Protestants in Germany seemed subdued. France was once again involved in her own instabilities (the famous Siege of La Rochelle began in 1627), and Spain's eminence seemed irrefutable.

2500|$|Title I authorizes {{measures}} {{to enhance the}} ability of domestic security services to prevent terrorism. The title established a fund for counter-terrorist activities and increased funding for the Terrorist Screening Center which {{is administered by the}} FBI. The military was authorized to provide assistance in some situations that involve weapons of mass destruction when so requested by the Attorney General. The National Electronic Crime Task Force was expanded, along with the President's authority and abilities in cases of terrorism. The title also condemned the discrimination against Arab and Muslim Americans that happened soon after the September 11 terrorist attacks. The impetus for many of the provisions came from earlier bills, for instance the condemnation of discrimination was originally proposed by Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) in an amendment to the Combatting Terrorism Act of 2001, though in a different form. It originally included [...] "the prayer of Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, the Archbishop of Washington in a Mass on September 12, 2001 <b>for</b> <b>our</b> <b>Nation</b> and the victims {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the terrorist hijackings and attacks in New York City, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania reminds all Americans that 'We must seek the guilty and not strike out against the innocent or we become like them who are without moral guidance or proper direction.'" [...] Further condemnation of racial vilification and violence is also spelled out in Title X, where there was condemnation of such activities against Sikh Americans, who were mistaken for Muslims after the September 11th terrorist attack.|$|E

We should respect the past, certainly, but must also confidently challenge the present and be well prepared for the future. We live at a time in which the forces of globalisation are dominant. People and countries are more interconnected than ever before, but differences remain and often we are driven apart by our individual interests. Too often prejudice and greed continue to dominate discussion of the issues – typically difficult and sensitive – that divide rich and poor countries. Problems cannot be solved while these attitudes remain, nor will they be solved by chance or wishful thinking. The difficulties facing the Pacific can only be overcome through foresight, determination and regional integration, with a view to overcoming tensions and designing effective outcomes. We need a visionary plan <b>for</b> <b>our</b> <b>nations</b> and <b>our</b> region. The needs and desires of Pacific people must lie at its heart. Let us begin from within.
