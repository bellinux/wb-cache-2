50|$|The Comptroller is also {{asserting that}} a {{competitor}} has no standing {{to object to}} lawful competition. With this rule we find no fault, but the banks surely have the standing to object to <b>illegal</b> <b>competition.</b> Frost v. Corporation Commission of Oklahoma, 278 U.S. 515, 49 S.Ct. 235, 73 L.Ed. 483 (1929); National Bank of Detroit v. Wayne Oakland Bank, 252 F.2d 537 (6 Cir. 1958), cert. denied 358 U.S. 830, 79 S.Ct. 503. Therefore, when a competitor believes he is being subjected to <b>illegal</b> <b>competition</b> owing to impropriety by the Comptroller, the courts should be open to hear and decide the alleged wrong. The trial court was vested with jurisdiction over {{the subject matter of}} this litigation.|$|R

Preventing collusion {{is one of the}} main aims of COMPETITION policy, and there is a distinction between explicit and tacit collusion. Explicit collusion refers to a cartel that colludes by directly communicating with each other. Tacit collusion is where firms collude without such explicit communication. Usually, only explicit collusion is considered <b>illegal.</b> <b>Competition</b> authorities attempt to deter cartels through sanctions on the firms and the individuals involved, and leniency programmes are an important method in which cartels are detected. Firms are encouraged to establish compliance programmes to avoid breaches of the law by their employees...|$|R
50|$|The {{street vendors}} in Argentina {{are known as}} manteros, after the Spanish word for blanket, manta. They sell varied {{products}} in an informal way, in most cases placing them over a blanket. They are, in their most part, illegal immigrants without documents and victims of human trafficking, subject to forced labor. They work at the sidewalks of locations with an important daily traffic, such as the Once railway station, the Retiro railway station, and the Florida Street. This commerce poses an <b>illegal</b> <b>competition</b> with the regular retail shops.

40|$|The current {{discussions on}} a future {{framework}} for competition policy within the World Trade Organization (2 ̆ 2 WTO 2 ̆ 2) have revealed reservations against the full {{application of the}} WTO dispute settlement system to such a framework. The current dispute settlement system of the WTO {{is one of the}} results of the Uruguay Round negotiations. For an international agreement of nearly universal scope, this system is unique in its obligatory and quasi-automatic character. In general, complaints can be brought to the WTO against national laws which fail to comply with WTO obligations and also against a WTO-inconsistent application of national laws in individual cases. The possibility of enforcing the legal obligations resulting from the agreements negotiated within the WTO and the stronger force that these agreements thus have is one of the reasons why the proponents of a WTO <b>competition</b> <b>agreement</b> favor the WTO as a negotiation forum. Nevertheless, several of these proponents contemplate at most a limited future role for the WTO dispute settlement system within a future <b>competition</b> <b>agreement.</b> At the outset, the United States in particular took a skeptical approach, which the European Communities seem to have now joined in...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the basic}} {{problems}} the tradesmen are faced with is <b>illegal</b> <b>competition,</b> the best indicator {{of which is a}} chaotic situation at marketplaces as a result of unprofessional work of the inspections. The implementation of more effective and regular measures accompanied by sanctions imposed on the owners of the marketplaces would have stimulating effects on all firms and taxpayers whose business is in accordance with the legal acts and regulations, thus contributing to making better conditions for the companies who do their businesses in a legal way and thus increase taxation, which is of great importance for our municipality. Moreover, one of the general factors which incite economical development is stimulation of entrepreneurship, which is at low level in our municipality.|$|R

5|$|Faced {{with growing}} legal and <b>illegal</b> <b>competition</b> for the {{globally}} marketed ASA, Bayer worked to cement {{the connection between}} Bayer and Aspirin. One strategy it developed was to switch from distributing Aspirin powder for pharmacists to press into pill form to distributing standardized tablets—complete with the distinctive Bayer cross logo. In 1903 the company set up an American subsidiary, with a converted factory in Rensselaer, New York, to produce Aspirin for the American market without paying import duties. Bayer also sued the most egregious patent violators and smugglers. The company's attempts to hold onto its Aspirin sales incited criticism from muckraking journalists and the American Medical Association, especially after the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act that prevented trademarked drugs from being listed in the United States Pharmacopeia; Bayer listed ASA with an intentionally convoluted generic name (monoacetic acid ester of salicylic acid) to discourage doctors referring to anything but Aspirin.|$|R

The first part of this thesis contains mainly a basic definition of <b>agreements</b> interfering with <b>competition,</b> their division according to their content as well as division to horizontal and vertical agreements which is important to assess agreements with an insignificant impact on the competition. When assessing the influence of an agreement it is also necessary to take legal and block exemptions into account.

For this agreement having a form of bid rigging the Office imposed the highest fine in its history.
