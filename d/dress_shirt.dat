5|$|On the German {{side of the}} lines, Voss {{had changed}} clothing. He wore a {{colourful}} civilian silk <b>dress</b> <b>shirt</b> beneath his unbuttoned knee-length brown leather coat. His polished brown boots shone from below the coat's hem. His Pour le Mérite was at his throat. He was to lead {{one of the two}} scheduled afternoon patrols. Leutnant Gustav Bellen was his righthand wingman; Leutnant Friedrich Rüdenberg had Voss's other side. After takeoff at 18:05 hours, Voss, with his new Fokker Triplane, advanced its throttle and soon outdistanced his two wingmen flying slower Pfalz D.IIIs. A few minutes later, Oberleutnant Ernst Weigand in Albatros D.V number 1187/17 led a second flight skyward; three Pfalz D.IIIs followed him, piloted by Leutnants Erich Löwenhardt, Alois Heldmann, and Max Kuhn.

5|$|The idea of Jesse riding go-karts {{by himself}} to relax was {{inspired}} by Aaron Paul and other crew members who often went kart racing between filming of Breaking Bad episodes in Albuquerque, New Mexico. During one of the party scenes at Jesse's house, Jesse keeps throwing crumpled dollar bills {{at the mouth of}} a sleeping man wearing a <b>dress</b> <b>shirt</b> and tie with no pants until he finally gets one inside his mouth. Catlin thought of the idea, and it was property master Trina Siopy actually throwing the bills off-screen; she got one into the actor's mouth on her second try. The scenes in Jesse's house were shot on a set in a sound stage built by production designer Mark Freeborn and construction coordinator William Gilpin. Although scenes in Jesse's house are occasionally filmed in an actual house, these particular scenes could not be shot there because the party was so messy.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the 1960s, {{the band}} wore a {{modified}} version of the full uniform on away trips. The modified uniform was also worn when the band was in concert. This consisted of the band hat without plume and a white waist belt was worn instead of cross belts. The band also wore a red citation cord on the left shoulder. As more away trips were taken, the band found it necessary to create a separate travel uniform which allowed the regular uniform to stay clean and pressed. Band students wear a black blazer with a patch of the OSUMB crest on the left brest pocket, white <b>dress</b> <b>shirt,</b> red OSUMB tie, gray pants, and black shoes. While not technically allowed, many band members can be seen wearing their band hats on away trips using air travel, as the hats cannot be placed in the luggage bays for fear of breaking.

25|$|The dinner dress uniforms of the United States Navy are {{the most}} formal and have the most variations. For officers, there are Dinner Dress Blue and Dinner Dress White, Dinner Dress Blue Jacket and Dinner Dress White Jacket, and Formal Dress. Although {{trousers}} are authorized, women frequently wear the appropriate color skirt. Dinner Dress Blue and White are identical to their Service Dress versions, but worn with miniature medals and badges with no ribbons. Dinner Dress Blue is additionally worn with a <b>dress</b> <b>shirt</b> and black bow tie. These variants are commonly worn by many junior officers and enlisted personnel as substitutes for the more formal Dinner Dress Jacket variant which is only prescribable for Lieutenant Commander and above and optional for Lieutenant and below. The Dinner Dress Blue/White Jacket uniforms feature a short jacket with three buttons on either side, worn open with a black bow tie and cummerbund (women substitute a neck tab for the bow tie). Male officers show rank stripes on the sleeves of the jacket for the blue version and on shoulder boards for the white version, while women officers only wear sleeve stripes.

25|$|OSU ROTC's {{shoulder}} insignia {{was a red}} {{and gray}} circle. This was worn on the right shoulder. On the right sleeve, a five pointed star signifying OSU was {{the recipient of the}} ROTC Honor School award was worn. Near the cuff of the left sleeve, a shield patch with U.S. R.O.T.C embroidered on it was worn. If the cadet had attained a rank in ROTC, they wore their rank insignia on each sleeve. The color of rank chevrons and the ROTC shield patch were determined by the military division in which the cadet was looking to commission. For example, an Artillery cadet would wear a black shield with scarlet lettering and black chevrons on a scarlet background, while an Infantry cadet would wear a black shield with teal lettering and black chevrons on a teal background. The hat took on a more modern look as well, looking more like the modern military style visor hat. ROTC chin straps and uniform buttons were gold colored. The peace eagle remained, but an addition was made to the eagles, an extra banner that arced above the E. Pluribus Unum banner from the eagle’s beak. This banner simply read “OHIO,” earning the OSUMB’s peace eagles the nickname “Eagle Ohio.” These early Eagle Ohios were made in gold colored metal to match the buttons and chin strap of the uniform jacket and hat. The regular uniform of an OSU ROTC cadet included a navy blue service coat, a light blue <b>dress</b> <b>shirt,</b> black tie, navy blue pants, white cotton spats, black dress shoes, and a white canvas belt with a gold buckle.|$|E
