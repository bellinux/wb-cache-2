25|$|In 1935 an {{experimental}} A.C.F.I. (Accessoires pour les Chemins de Fer et l'Industrie) <b>feedwater</b> <b>heater</b> was fitted to A2 973. However, {{there was not}} sufficient improvement in efficiency for the equipment to be fitted to other locomotives and it was removed twelve years later.|$|E
25|$|As built, {{however, the}} class was lacking {{much in the way}} of modern {{appliances}} due to the PRR's conservatism; features missing included a mechanical stoker, power reverse, and a <b>feedwater</b> <b>heater,</b> although most of the class were later given a stoker and all received power reverse.|$|E
25|$|DM {{were the}} only Yellowstones to have a {{high-capacity}} pedestal or centipede tender, and had roller bearings on all axles. Some of the locomotives had a cylindrical Elesco <b>feedwater</b> <b>heater</b> ahead of the smoke stack, while others had a Worthington unit with its rectangular box in the same location.|$|E
50|$|Many {{power plants}} {{incorporate}} {{a number of}} <b>feedwater</b> <b>heaters</b> and may use both open and closed components. <b>Feedwater</b> <b>heaters</b> are used in both fossil- and nuclear-fueled power plants.|$|R
5000|$|The main picture shows a CSAR Class 10-2, later SAR Class 10B, as {{delivered}} with <b>feedwater</b> <b>heaters</b> on the running boards, while the 1930s picture below shows {{one with the}} <b>feedwater</b> <b>heaters</b> removed.|$|R
50|$|Three {{locomotives}} (781, 783, and 793) received ACFI <b>feedwater</b> <b>heaters.</b> In 1933, two locomotives (788 and 793) were {{fitted with}} Kyl채l채 exhausts.|$|R
25|$|The 1925 {{design was}} by Milwaukee Road Chief Mechanical Engineer C. H. Bilty, with detail design by the Baldwin Locomotive Works, who {{actually}} built them. They represented {{the best of}} American locomotive practice at the time, and were given all the latest devices and fittings. A Coffin <b>feedwater</b> <b>heater</b> was fitted, which was the Milwaukee's favorite type; this was installed flush in the extended smokebox, and thus {{was not at all}} obvious. Possibly because of this, the boiler lagging was continued over the smokebox, which was not common; most North American locomotives had bare smokeboxes which were graphited, rather than painted. The associated steam-driven centrifugal water pump was located under the cab at the left rear. The class F6-a was fitted with the tender-mounted Wilson Water Conditioner instead of the Coffin <b>feedwater</b> <b>heater.</b>|$|E
25|$|Introducing {{cold water}} into a boiler reduces power, and from the 1920s a variety of heaters were incorporated. The most common type for {{locomotives}} was the exhaust steam <b>feedwater</b> <b>heater</b> that piped some of the exhaust through small tanks mounted {{on top of the}} boiler or smokebox or into the tender tank; the warm water then had to be delivered to the boiler by a small auxiliary steam pump. The rare economiser type differed in that it extracted residual heat from the exhaust gases. An example of this is the pre-heater drum(s) found on the Franco-Crosti boiler.|$|E
2500|$|They were {{equipped}} with the newest technology including the Worthington <b>feedwater</b> <b>heater,</b> superheater with front-end throttle, Cyclone front end, thermic syphons, a lateral cushioning device in the front pair of drivers on both engines and the front wheels and the trailing truck, as well as roller bearings on all axles, engine and tender, which gave them the reputation of [...] "yard creepers", because three men could move one on a level track with the cylinder cocks open.|$|E
50|$|The first Mohawks {{delivered}} for the NYC {{were delivered}} by ALCO in 1916; these were purely freighters, with 69-inch drivers and small tenders. Further orders of L-1 subclasses followed in subsequent years, including {{some from the}} Lima Locomotive Works. All these locomotives had uncluttered lines as built, mostly thanks {{to the lack of}} such modern appliances as <b>feedwater</b> <b>heaters,</b> booster engines and the like. Many had <b>feedwater</b> <b>heaters</b> and other appliances added later, however. 185 L-1 locomotives were produced.|$|R
50|$|Several {{locomotives}} had smoke deflectors {{installed in}} 1931 {{as well as}} ACFI <b>feedwater</b> <b>heaters.</b> The class was renumbered 231.B.1 to 231.B.60 in 1938.|$|R
5000|$|Steam {{exiting the}} turbine flows into {{condensers}} located underneath the low-pressure turbines, where the steam is cooled {{and returned to}} the liquid state (condensate). The condensate is then pumped through <b>feedwater</b> <b>heaters</b> that raise its temperature using extraction steam from various turbine stages. Feedwater from the <b>feedwater</b> <b>heaters</b> enters the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) through nozzles high on the vessel, well above the top of the nuclear fuel assemblies (these nuclear fuel assemblies constitute the [...] "core") but below the water level.|$|R
2500|$|As {{the use of}} vacuum {{reduces the}} vapour pressure, the {{seawater}} need only be raised to a temperature of [...] Both evaporator and distiller are combined into a single chamber, although most plants use two joined chambers, worked in series. The first chamber is worked at [...] vacuum, the second at [...] Seawater is supplied to the distiller by a pump at around [...] The cold seawater passes through a condenser coil in {{the upper part of}} each chamber before being heated by steam in an external <b>feedwater</b> <b>heater.</b> The heated seawater enters {{the lower part of the}} first chamber, then drains over a weir and passes to the second chamber, encouraged by the differential vacuum between them. The brine produced by a flash distiller is only slightly concentrated and is pumped overboard continuously.|$|E
50|$|A widely use Code for the procedures, direction, and {{guidance}} {{for determining the}} thermo-hydraulic performance of a closed <b>feedwater</b> <b>heater</b> is the ASME PTC 12.1 <b>Feedwater</b> <b>Heater</b> Standard.|$|E

50|$|Numbers 9672-74 were {{fitted with}} ACFI <b>feedwater</b> <b>heaters</b> when built {{but these were}} removed during the Second World War. After the war, five were briefly {{converted}} to oil burning.|$|R
50|$|In 1952 and 1953, 35 of the Class 625 {{locomotives}} {{were converted}} to use Franco-Crosti boilers with side <b>feedwater</b> <b>heaters.</b> These locomotives became the Class 623. Several survived into the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|The next {{development}} of the Mohawk type for the New York Central was the L-2, 300 of its various subclasses being built between 1925-1930. These were rather more modern locomotives than the L-1 class, fat-boilered, long-tendered, fitted with <b>feedwater</b> <b>heaters,</b> mostly of the Elesco type and generally mounted {{in front of the}} smokebox at the top, giving an aggressive, beetle browed look. Later L-2 subclasses, the L-2b and L-2c, had somewhat smoother lines with recessed <b>feedwater</b> <b>heaters</b> and cleaned up lines. The later L-2 locomotives, in fact, looked very close in styling to the Central's fleet of Hudson passenger locomotives.|$|R

50|$|In 1940 {{the first}} of the Class 743 class were built. These were entirely new {{locomotives}} with two <b>feedwater</b> <b>heaters,</b> one {{on each side of the}} boiler. In all 94 of this class were built for FS.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the earlier}} engines, these last five {{locomotives}} were built without <b>feedwater</b> <b>heaters.</b> Their Pyle National Turbo-generators were arranged {{on top of}} the last boiler barrel course instead of in front of the chimney and behind the headlight.|$|R
50|$|In 1951 the Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) rebuilt two Franco-Crosti boilered {{locomotives}} {{with two}} <b>feedwater</b> <b>heaters</b> located below the main boiler. These were variants {{of the standard}} DB class 52 design but were registered as class 42.90 due to the higher axle load.|$|R

50|$|An {{exhaust steam}} <b>feedwater</b> <b>heater</b> was {{provided}} and the boiler fed by duplex pumps {{located on the}} frames, between the coupled wheels.|$|E
50|$|Modern-day boilers, such {{as those}} in {{coal-fired}} power stations, are still fitted with economizers which are descendants of Green's original design. In this context they are often referred to as <b>feedwater</b> <b>heaters</b> and heat the condensate from turbines before it is pumped to the boilers.|$|R
25|$|Alternatively the 'double flow' boiler {{retained}} full {{gas flow}} through both sides, although {{only one of}} these contained a superheater. A controllable baffle on the non-superheated side could be closed to increase flow through the superheater. These boilers usually incorporated additional <b>feedwater</b> <b>heaters</b> in the updraught above these baffles.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{variation}} sends {{bleed steam}} from between turbine stages to <b>feedwater</b> <b>heaters</b> to preheat {{the water on}} its way from the condenser to the boiler. These heaters do not mix the input steam and condensate, function as an ordinary tubular heat exchanger, and are named [...] "closed feedwater heaters".|$|R
50|$|K 919 {{was given}} an ACFI <b>feedwater</b> <b>heater</b> system as a trial, a feature that was {{continued}} on the subsequent KA and KB classes.|$|E

50|$|The new DR Class 99.23-24 {{locomotives}} {{were built}} {{on the basis of}} the Einheitsloks. Differences in the new engines are the <b>feedwater</b> <b>heater</b> and the bar frame.|$|E
50|$|Extracting type {{turbines}} {{are common}} in all applications. In an extracting type turbine, steam is released from various stages of the turbine, and used for industrial process needs or sent to boiler <b>feedwater</b> <b>heaters</b> to improve overall cycle efficiency. Extraction flows may be controlled with a valve, or left uncontrolled.|$|R
5000|$|All {{but three}} of the {{locomotives}} in this class were rebuilt as the AC-3 class with [...] "simpled" [...] uniform cylinders of 22 x 30 in by 1930. The last three were thus rebuilt in 1937. During the rebuild, 4쩌-BL Worthington <b>feedwater</b> <b>heaters</b> were also installed on the fireman's side of the locomotives.|$|R
50|$|In a {{steam power}} plant (usually modeled as a {{modified}} Rankine cycle), <b>feedwater</b> <b>heaters</b> allow the <b>feedwater</b> to be brought up to the saturation temperature very gradually. This minimizes the inevitable irreversibilities associated with heat transfer to the working fluid (water). See the article on the second law of thermodynamics for a further discussion of such irreversibilities.|$|R
