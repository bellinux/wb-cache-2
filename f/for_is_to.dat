We're {{just going to have}} to go there and do it the old-fashioned way next week and try to beat them on the race track." [...] Afterward, Newman, who finished second, commented, [...] "We were saving fuel the whole time. Made more sense to save fuel. We were two laps short. We just did what I thought we needed to do. If Carl made it, Carl made it." [...] Fifth place finisher Johnson described his happiness by saying: [...] "We're going to go home and we're going to make sure we have the best engines, go through our simulation stuff, make sure our car is as fast as it can be and then race. We were in a good situation and could take the risk, take the chance. It worked out for us.|$|E
500|$|In his {{original}} appearance, Jason was scripted as a mentally disabled young boy. Since Friday the 13th, Jason Voorhees has been {{depicted as a}} non-verbal, indestructible, machete-wielding mass murderer. Jason is primarily portrayed as being completely silent throughout the film series. Exceptions to this include flashbacks of Jason as a child, and a brief scene in Jason Takes Manhattan where the character cries out [...] "Mommy, please don't let me drown!" [...] in a child's voice before being submerged in toxic waste, and in Jason Goes To Hell where his spirit possesses other individuals. Online magazine Salon's Andrew O'Hehir describes Jason as a [...] "silent, expressionless...blank slate." [...] When discussing Jason psychologically, Sean S. Cunningham said, [...] "...he doesn't have any personality. He's like a great white shark. You can't really defeat him. All you can hope <b>for</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> survive." [...] Since Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives, Jason has been a [...] "virtually indestructible" [...] being. Tom McLoughlin, the film's director, felt it was silly that Jason had previously been just another guy in a mask, who would kill people left and right, but get [...] "beaten up and knocked down by the heroine at the end". McLoughlin wanted Jason {{to be more of}} a [...] "formidable, unstoppable monster". In resurrecting Jason from the dead, McLoughlin also gave him the weakness of being rendered helpless if trapped beneath the waters of Crystal Lake; inspired by vampire lore, McLoughlin decided that Jason had in fact drowned as a child, and that returning him to {{his original}} resting place would immobilize him. This weakness would be presented again in The New Blood, and the idea that Jason had drowned as a child was taken up by director Rob Hedden as a plot element in Jason Takes Manhattan.|$|E
40|$|According to fitting-attitudes {{accounts}} of value (FA accounts), what it <b>is</b> <b>for</b> something <b>to</b> <b>be</b> good or of value <b>is</b> <b>for</b> it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a fitting object of a pro-attitude. Some FA accounts take {{this notion of}} fittingness as primitive; others understand {{it in terms of}} normative reasons. Here I shall be concerned with this latter sort of account – accounts which hold that <b>for</b> something <b>to</b> <b>be</b> good <b>is</b> <b>for</b> there <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reasons <b>to</b> favour that thing. A central attraction of FA accounts, so understood, is that they promise straightforward explanations of the various connections between reasons and value. If what it <b>is</b> <b>for</b> something <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of value <b>is</b> <b>for</b> there <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reasons <b>to</b> favour that thing, then the connections between reasons and value may be a consequence of the nature of value. 2 In the first two sections of this paper, I motivate and defend one such connection, and show how it is nicely explained by a FA account. Of course, this form of argument <b>for</b> FA accounts <b>is</b> highly defeasible. If the connections between reasons and value are better explained by an alternative account, these connections do not give us strong reason to accept an FA account. An adequat...|$|R
40|$|According to the fitting-{{attitude}}s {{account of}} value, <b>for</b> X <b>to</b> <b>be</b> good <b>is</b> <b>for</b> it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fitting <b>to</b> value X. But what <b>is</b> it <b>for</b> an attitude <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fitting? A popular recent {{view is that}} it <b>is</b> <b>for</b> there <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sufficient reason <b>for</b> the attitude. In this paper we argue that proponents of the fitting-attitudes account should reject this view and instead take fittingness as basic. In this way they avoid the notorious ‘wrong kind of reason’ problem, and can offer attractive accounts of reasons and good reasoning in terms of fittingness...|$|R

[...] According to seismologists, these are caused by the movement of water through sedimentary rock. Erosion causes gaps and then the gaps settle onto themselves, causing the small quakes.
