5|$|A {{mountain}} range in Alaska, and two naval ships, were named in De Long's honor. The three Arctic islands discovered during the expedition, plus two others discovered {{a few years}} later, form an archipelago that bears the name Ostrova De Longa; despite Melville's planting of the American flag, the islands <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> accepted as Russian territory.|$|E
5|$|Flocks in Australia <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> largely range bands on fenced land, and {{are aimed}} at {{production}} of medium to superfine wool for clothing and other products as well as meat. New Zealand flocks are kept in a fashion similar to English ones, in fenced holdings without shepherds. Although wool was once the primary income source for New Zealand sheep owners (especially during the New Zealand wool boom), today it has shifted to meat production for export.|$|E

5|$|Other {{details about}} the {{poisoning}} <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> in dispute. While some argue that Claudius was in Rome, others claim he was in Sinuessa on the night he was poisoned. Whether one ingestion of poison was only enough to cause Claudius to fall ill and whether a second dose was given to kill him is also debated.|$|E
5|$|Teams {{choosing}} {{to develop new}} air vehicle types have never won, as they are disadvantaged in comparison to those which adapt existing, working, air vehicles, and can therefore concentrate on performing the mission rather than developing something that will fly at all. As a result, adaptations of conventional rotary wing and fixed wing entries <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> the overall winners, with airships and ducted fans a close second.|$|E
5|$|The United States Numbered Highway System (often called U.S. Routes or U.S. Highways) is an {{integrated}} network of roads and highways numbered within a nationwide grid in the contiguous United States. As the designation and numbering of these highways were coordinated among the states, {{they are sometimes}} called Federal Highways, but the roadways were built and <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> maintained by state or local governments since their initial designation in 1926.|$|E

5|$|The addax {{are most}} prone to parasites in moist climatic conditions. Addax <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> {{infected}} with nematodes in the Trichostrongyloidea and Strongyloidea superfamilies. In an exotic ranch in Texas, an addax was found {{host to the}} nematodes Haemonchus contortus and Longistrongylus curvispiculum in its abomasum, of which the former was dominant.|$|E
5|$|The {{economics}} of fission–fusion designs <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> questionable. The same basic {{effect can be}} created by replacing the central fusion reactor with a specially designed fission reactor, and using the surplus neutrons from the fission to breed fuel in the blanket. These fast breeder reactors have proven uneconomical in practice, and the greater expense of the fusion systems in the fission–fusion hybrid has always suggested they would be uneconomical unless built in very large units.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin and}} meaning of Ely's name <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> {{regarded}} as obscure by place-name scholars, and are still disputed. The earliest record of the name is in the Latin text of Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, where Bede wrote Elge. This is apparently not a Latin name, and subsequent Latin texts nearly all used the forms Elia, Eli, or Heli with inorganic H-. In Old English charters, and in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the spelling is usually Elig.|$|E

5|$|Although kings, {{rulers and}} {{powerful}} people <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> {{able to pay}} for entertainment to be provided for them and in many cases have paid for public entertainment, people generally have made their own entertainment or when possible, attended a live performance. Technological developments in the 20th century meant that entertainment could be produced independently of the audience, packaged and sold on a commercial basis by an entertainment industry. Sometimes referred to as show business, the industry relies on business models to produce, market, broadcast or otherwise distribute many of its traditional forms, including performances of all types. The industry became so sophisticated that its economics became a separate area of academic study.|$|E
5|$|Cases {{have been}} {{recorded}} by medical authorities since the 16th century, though some archaeological cases provide evidence for its occurrence in many periods of human history. While cases of postmortem fetal expulsion <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> rare, the phenomenon has been recorded under disparate circumstances and is occasionally seen in a modern forensic context when {{the body of a}} pregnant woman lies undisturbed and undiscovered for some time following death. There are also cases whereby a fetus may become separated from the body of the pregnant woman about the time of death or during decomposition, though because those cases are not consistent with the processes described here, they are not considered true cases of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E
5|$|Coarse or {{carpet wool}} sheep are {{those with a}} medium to long length wool of {{characteristic}} coarseness. Breeds traditionally used for carpet wool show great variability, but the chief requirement is a wool that will not break down under heavy use (as would that of the finer breeds). As the demand for carpet-quality wool declines, some breeders {{of this type of}} sheep are attempting to use a few of these traditional breeds for alternative purposes. Others <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> primarily meat-class sheep.|$|E

5|$|Dinosaurs <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> an {{extremely}} varied group of animals; {{according to a}} 2006 study, over 500non-avian dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and {{the total number of}} genera preserved in the fossil record has been estimated at around1850, nearly 75% of which remain to be discovered. An earlier study predicted that about 3400dinosaur genera existed, including many {{that would not have been}} preserved in the fossil record. By September 17, 2008, 1047 different species of dinosaurs had been named.|$|E
5|$|Express trains {{operated}} by NSB <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> the primary passenger service on Bergensbanen. Passenger trains follow the Drammen Line and the Asker Line to Drammen, before heading north to Hønefoss on the Randsfjord Line. The express trains offer both transport from villages {{along the line}} to either Bergen or Oslo, as well travel between Norway's two largest cities. Expresses are locomotive-hauled trains with modernized coaches. Six nights a week there is a night train service. Several {{parts of the line}} service places without road access, such as Finse and Myrdal. Operating deficits are covered by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications.|$|E
5|$|I thus learnt {{my first}} great {{lesson in the}} inquiry into these obscure fields of knowledge, never to accept the disbelief of great men or their accusations of imposture or of imbecility, as of any weight when opposed to the {{repeated}} observation of facts by other men, admittedly sane and honest. The whole history of science shows us that whenever the educated and scientific men of any age have denied the facts of other investigators on a priori grounds of absurdity or impossibility, the deniers <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> wrong.|$|E

5|$|The first Prophet in {{the mythology}} of Carnivàle is the Alpha. This {{creature}} is never mentioned in the series, but Knauf described her as a female who lived before the Flood and whose story was lost with {{the destruction of the}} Royal Library of Alexandria. The Alpha spawned the first pair of Avatara, manifestations of some higher power or House; one is Light and the other Dark. A Creature of Light and a Creature of Darkness have been born to each generation since, and unlike the Alpha, they <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> male.|$|E
5|$|There <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> Arsenal {{supporters}} outside London, {{and since}} the advent of satellite television, a supporter's attachment to a football club has become less dependent on geography. Consequently, Arsenal have a significant number of fans from beyond London and all over the world; in 2007, 24 UK, 37 Irish and 49 other overseas supporters clubs were affiliated with the club. A 2011 report by SPORT+MARKT estimated Arsenal's global fanbase at 113 million. The club's social media activity was the fifth highest in world football during the 2014–15 season.|$|E
5|$|A leat runs to {{the east}} of the town's main street but it is {{uncertain}} when it was first constructed. By the early seventeenth century, {{the southern end of the}} leat and one mill are shown on a map. There were three main mills: Higher Mill, Lower Mill and Middle Mill. Higher Mill appears to <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> a corn mill and it continued to produce animal feed until 1974. It has since been converted to housing but a water turbine remains. Middle Mill was used as a woollen mill in the nineteenth century and was also associated with Bilbie's bell foundry (see below). Around 1900, the mill was steam powered and had a boiler delivered. It is labelled as an axle works on the 1904 Second Edition Ordnance Survey map. The only remains of Middle Mill are some walls and a chimney base. Lower Mill ceased working in 1968. The building is now in residential use but the sluices (made by Stenner and Gunn of the Lowman Ironworks, Tiverton) can still be seen, as can the water wheel and gearing.|$|E
