About 2300 BC there was immigration from Finland and later the area was largely used by Skolts for reindeer husbandry. Norwegian immigration started about 1850, and the first land was granted land for farming in 1874, after a road was built along the valley to Svanvatn. This was followed up by Russian immigration {{to the other side}} of the border. The road was extended to Grensefossen in 1939 and after 1945 the population on the Russian side was forcefully moved by the Soviet authorities and the area depopulated. The Soviet Union started planning to regulate Pasvikelva for hydroelectricity in the 1940s, with the first power station opening in 1951.

50|$|Arppe {{travelled}} to Central Europe in 1845 gaining {{knowledge about}} agriculture and forestry. He applied the ideas {{at his own}} property. In order to get more land for fields, he reduced the mater level of lake Pyhäjärvi by opening Puhoksenkoski rapids. Consequently, water level went down by two metres and the other discharging river Hiiskoski almost dried out. Flow in Puhoskoski increased, while the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>fall</b> got lower. As a result, Arppe gained 200 hectares of land. Arppe tested new farming methods in his property. He bought cattle from Netherlands and founded a dairy.|$|E
50|$|Plunge pools {{are formed}} by the natural force of falling water, such as at a {{waterfall}} or cascade; they also result from man-made structures such as some spillway designs, Plunge pools are often very deep, generally related to the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>fall,</b> the volume of water, {{the resistance of the}} rock below the pool and other factors. The impacting and swirling water, sometimes carrying rocks within it, abrades the riverbed into a basin, which often features rough and irregular sides. Plunge pools can remain long after the waterfall has ceased flow or the stream has been diverted. Several examples of former plunge pools exist at Dry Falls in the Channeled Scablands of eastern Washington.|$|E

50|$|It {{consists}} of a large frame carrying two beams from which two rows of six and two wooden balls, respectively, are suspended from pairs of strings. The instrument was often used with two elastic balls (of ivory) or inelastic balls (of wet clay), of equal or different mass. By changing {{the parameters of the}} experiments such as <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>fall</b> and mass, one could conduct a systematic investigation of collision-related phenomena. For example, when the row of balls is struck by one of the outermost balls, the row of balls remains motionless and the impulse is fully transmitted to the ball at the opposite end, which rebounds. As it falls back, the cycle continues in the opposite direction. This apparatus was illustrated by Jean-Antoine Nollet in Leçons de physique expérimentale (Paris, 1743-1748). In his description, Nollet claims to have merely altered and developed a model previously used by Edme Mariotte. The most sophisticated devices for studying elastic and inelastic collisions were built by Willem Jacob 's Gravesande and Petrus van Musschenbroek.|$|E
40|$|Aim of study: To {{assess the}} types {{and extent of}} {{injuries}} sustained by victims of fall from height depending on the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>fall.</b> Material and methods: The study included 338 bodies of victims of fatal falls from different heights (from the 1 st to 10 th floors) who were subjected to medico-legal autopsy at the Department of Forensic Medicine, Jagiellonian University Medical College, between 1995 and 2014. For each individual, selected data were collected including gender, age, body height, injury types and presence of alcohol or other intoxicants in blood. The analysis comprised injuries to the brain, thoracic and abdominal organs, fractures of the skull, extremities, ribs and spine, and fractures of the scapula, clavicle and sternum (considered together). The study focused on determining the frequency of occurrence of different injuries in relation {{to one another and}} depending on the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>fall.</b> Results : The number and extent of injuries was found to increase along with the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>fall.</b> Three injury types, including injuries to the mesentery and both kidneys and fractures of upper extremity small bones, were shown to occur from the threshold heights of the 3 rd, 4 th and 6 th floors. Eleven injuries demonstrated a statistically significant correlation with the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>fall.</b> The study also revealed a number of correlations between the frequencies of occurrence of different injuries. Conclusions : Injuries found from the threshold value may suggest the minimal <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>fall.</b> The presence of injuries which correlate with increasing height, and the overall number of injuries observed in victims of fall from height, may be useful for inferring the height of the fall...|$|E
30|$|There {{is greater}} {{difficulty}} {{in establishing the}} correlation between the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>fall</b> and mortality. Lapostolle et al.

[7] reported no statistically significant correlation between these variables as was also found in our study. We suggest that other variables such as the type of impact surface or contact preceding the impact {{may play a role in}} the final outcome; however, all of these factors are difficult to document accurately. None of these variables were studied in this review, this being a potential limitation of our study.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Information on {{physical}} properties of broiler chickens diets {{is not available}} in literatures and such information is important for design and construction of poultry equipments. Some physical properties of starter, grower and finisher diet of broiler chickens, namely: gravimetrical (bulk density, true density and porosity) and frictional properties (coefficient of friction filling angle of repose, empting angle of repose and pouring angle of repose) were studied. Effect <b>of</b> <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> diets to the containers at 150, 250 and 350 mm and volume of the containers at 500, 600, 1, 100 and 2, 000 mL on bulk density and porosity of diets were studied. Results indicated that true density of the starter; grower and finisher diets were 1, 442. 574, 1, 512. 694 and 1, 541. 320 kg m 3, respectively. A comparison between the three levels <b>of</b> <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> for three diets indicated that with increasing <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling,</b> bulk density were increased and porosity were decreased. The coefficient of friction of starter, grower and finisher diet on different surfaces changed from 18. 033 to 26. 743 °, 18. 083 to 27. 193 ° and 18. 293 to 27. 570 °, respectively. The values obtained for pouring angle of repose of starter diet on iron, plywood and galvanized surfaces were 34. 40 °, 36. 05 ° and 30. 22 °, respectively.

40|$|Introduction: Work-related {{traumatic}} brain injury (TBI) caused by falls is a catastrophic event that leads to disabilities and high socio-medical costs. This study aimed to measure {{the magnitude of the}} preventive effect of safety helmets on clinical outcomes and to compare the effect across different heights of fall. Methods: We collected a nationwide, prospective database of work-related injury patients who visited the 10 emergency departments between July 2010 and October 2012. All of the adult patients who experienced work-related fall injuries were eligible, excluding cases with unknown safety helmet use and <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>fall.</b> Primary and secondary endpoints were intracranial injury and in-hospital mortality. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of safety helmet use and <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>fall</b> for study outcomes, and adjusted for any potential confounders. Results: A total of 1298 patients who suffered from work-related fall injuries were enrolled. The industrial or construction area was the most common place of fall injury occurrence, and 45. 0 % were wearing safety helmets at the time of fall injuries. The safety helmet group was less likely to have intracranial injury comparing with the no safety helmet group (the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) (95 % confidence interval (CI)) : 0. 42 (0. 24 – 0. 73)), however, there was no statistical difference of in-hospital mortality between two groups (the adjusted ORs (95 % CI) : 0. 83 (0. 34 – 2. 03). In the interaction analysis, preventive effects of safety helmet on intracranial injury were significant within 4 m <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>fall.</b> Conclusions: A safety helmet is associated with prevention of intracranial injury resulting from work-related fall and the effect is preserved within 4 m <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>fall.</b> Therefore, wearing a safety helmet can be an intervention for protecting fall-related intracranial injury in the workplace...|$|E
30|$|The American College of Surgeons {{recommend}} that patients injured in falls from heights greater than 20 feet (1  m =  3.2 feet) {{need to be}} taken to a trauma centre. The relation between the height of the fall and the severity of injury is controversial. Helling et al. [17] found that an ISS > 15 could be found in 35  % of patients who sustained injuries from a low fall; they also identified that low falls can be associated with life-threatening injuries even in patients who were stable initially. Goodacre et al. [9] reported that the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>fall</b> as an isolated variable is a poor predictor of injury severity and did not identify a height threshold which can be used for trauma triage. Other authors found a positive correlation between <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>fall</b> and severity of injury [5, 18, 19, 20]. Our results support this correlation, but we are not able to find a height threshold which we could use to exclude significant injury (Table  1).|$|E
