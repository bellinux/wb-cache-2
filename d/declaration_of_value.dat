40|$|ASEAN’s {{engagement}} with human rights {{culminated in the}} creation of the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration in 2012. The Declaration is fascinating in three ways: Its institutional origins are surprising, it was agreed upon by states with very different positions on the role of human rights domestically, and it both contains commitments far in advance of some members and is at the same time dangerously regressive. The three leading frameworks that currently interrogate the Declaration fail to provide convincing insights into all three of those dimensions. To correct these shortcomings, this article applies the notion of an “incompletely theorized agreement” to the study of the Declaration, arguing that member states understand the Declaration in very different ways and agreed to it for similarly diverse reasons. Further, I argue that the Declaration neither articulates a shared regional identity relating to respect for human rights, nor can it be understood as marking an early point towards the creation of this identity. Instead, the current diversity of regional opinions on human rights and democracy is perceived as legitimate and will endure. The article concludes by considering whether this denudes the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>value,</b> arguing that its importance will vary: The more progressive the member state, the more important the Declaration will be in the future.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore how a leading Ontario {{hospital}} operationalizes their Patient <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Values</b> (PDoV) in policy and in practice. This was a single case study, which took place in a leading patient-centred Ontario hospital. The study included 18 individual interviews with employees and patient experience advisors, as well as, document analysis of strategic planning reports (n= 10). Five themes emerged: (1) setting the stage, (2) inspiring change, (3) organizational structures, (4) organizational and environmental barriers, and (5) reflection and improvement. This study has highlighted the role of the PDoV within a leading Ontario hospital. It lends itself to providing a process with core strategies for creating change in an acute health care organization; to embed a culture of patient and family centred care...|$|R

The objective is to minimize power losses considering various load conditions. The problem is decomposed into four subproblems via the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition for reducing the dimen-sions of the problem. A second Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition divides each subproblem into several areas leading to a consid-erable reduction in the dimensions of subproblems. An illus-trative example demonstrates the applicability of the approach. The fuzzy approach provides a global solution for the system behavior under various load conditions...|$|R
40|$|Background The aim of {{the study}} was to {{ascertain}} the use <b>of</b> <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> ethical commitment made by medical students graduating from the final-year class of 2006 in Australia and New Zealand, the extent of student contribution to the process and the manner in which those declarations were declared. Methods Information was obtained, by telephone interview and email, from officers or responsible academic staff of faculties of medicine (or medicine and health sciences) in Australia and New Zealand. Results Of 20 medical faculties in Australia and New Zealand, seven were established recently and are yet to graduate students. Thirteen faculties graduated medical students in 2006 and students in 10 of those faculties made <b>declarations</b> on graduating. <b>Of</b> those, six faculties consulted with students in formulating and/or in deciding on the declaration and four gave students major responsibility for writing the declaration. Three faculties invited graduating students to modify the declaration each year. Students in two of those faculties had done so on occasion and, in the third, they had rewritten the declaration each year. Conclusion An increasing proportion of faculties of medicine in Australia and New Zealand provide for a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> ethical <b>values</b> on graduating. We emphasize educational opportunities for reinforcing these values by encouraging students to formulate their 'own' declaration, modify the declaration each year, read the declaration in a formal ceremony and by presenting graduating students with a plaque or printed declaration suitable for framing, which is signed by the Dean and graduating student. 6 page(s...|$|R
