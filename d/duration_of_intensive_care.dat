40|$|ObjectiveWe {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the impact of 22 q 11. 2 deletion on perioperative outcome in tetralogy of Fallot. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective review of patients with tetralogy of Fallot who underwent complete surgical reconstruction at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between 1995 and 2006. Inclusion criteria included diagnosis of tetralogy of Fallot and known genotype. Fisher exact and Mann–Whitney tests were used for categoric and continuous variables, respectively. Regression {{analysis was used to}} determine whether deletion status predicts outcome. ResultsWe studied 208 subjects with tetralogy of Fallot, 164 (79 %) without and 44 (20 %) with 22 q 11. 2 deletion syndrome. There were no differences in sex, race, gestational age, age at diagnosis, admission weight, and duration of mechanical ventilation. Presenting anatomy, survival, complications and reoperations were also comparable between patients with and without 22 q 11. 2 deletion syndrome. Those with 22 q 11. 2 deletion syndrome had more aortopulmonary shunts preceding complete surgical repair (21 % vs 7 %, P = . 02). This association was present after adjustment for presenting anatomy (stenosis, atresia, or absence of pulmonary valve and common atrioventricular canal) and surgical era. In addition, those with 22 q 11. 2 deletion syndrome had longer cardiopulmonary bypass time (84 vs 72 minutes, P = . 02) and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> (6 vs 4 days, P = . 007).

Secondary objectives were to evaluate <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> ventilation, <b>intensive</b> <b>care,</b> and antibiotic use as markers of efficacy.  DESIGN—Neonates (⩽ 28 days) in <b>intensive</b> <b>care,</b> with birth weights of 500 - 1500 g, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of ⩽ 5 × 109 /l, and clinical evidence of sepsis, were randomly assigned to receive either rhG-CSF (10 µg/kg/day) administered intravenously (n = 13), or placebo (n = 15) for a maximum of 14 days, in addition to standard treatment and antibiotics. All adverse events, oxygenation index, incidence of thrombocytopenia, all cause mortality, <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> ventilation, <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> and antibiotic treatment, and ANC recovery were compared between the two groups.  RESULTS—Adverse events and oxygenation index were not increased by, and thrombocytopenia was not attributable to, treatment with rhG-CSF. At 6 and 12 months postmenstrual age, there were significantly fewer deaths in the group receiving rhG-CSF (1 / 13 v 7 / 15; p ⩽ 0. 038). There was a non-significant trend towards a reduction in <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> ventilation, <b>intensive</b> <b>care,</b> and antibiotic use in the rhG-CSF group. There was a significantly more rapid increase in ANC in the rhG-CSF treated babies (p < 0. 001).  CONCLUSIONS—In a small randomised placebo controlled trial in a highly selected group of neonates, adjuvant treatment with rhG-CSF increased ANC rapidly, and no treatment related adverse events were identified. Mortality at 6 and 12 months postmenstrual age was significantly lower in the treatment group. A large trial investigating efficacy in a similar group of neonates is warranted. ...|$|R

Choosing end points for therapeutic trials of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) requires careful consideration, because they are complications of critical illness. It {{may be difficult to}} distinguish the consequences of VAP and HAP from manifestations of the underlying illnesses, and it is important to determine their incremental magnitude, to plan for possible treatment effects and, thus, sample size calculations. In this article, we discuss mortality, attributable mortality, and time to clinical events as possible end points for HAP and/or VAP trials. Because of the paucity of evidence on HAP, we focus predominantly on VAP. In a systematic review of applicable trials, VAP appears to have slight <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> unit and low hospital-attributable mortality. VAP is associated with prolonged <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> unit stay, hospital stay, and mechanical ventilation. Because of these findings, superiority trials of VAP treatment that use mortality as a primary end point are not possible. Equivalency studies are possible, but there are sample size implications.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to review the outcomes of patients who had received coronary stenting before CABG, and to examine the validity of a mortality risk stratification system in this patient group. Methods: From 2010 to 2012, 439 patients who underwent isolated CABG at our medical center were reviewed. The patients were divided into two study groups: those who had previously received coronary artery stenting (97 patients, 24. 7 %), and those who had not (342 patients, 75. 3 %). The patients who received balloon angioplasty were excluded. Results: There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics. The prior stenting group had a lower risk of mortality, although the difference was not significant. The prior stenting group had fewer graft anastomoses (p =  0. 005), and hence a significantly shorter cardiopulmonary bypass time (p =  0. 045) and shorter aortic cross-clamping time. Surgical mortality was similar between the two groups. The <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> unit stay and hospitalization were also similar.

Secondary outcomes were partial pressure of carbon dioxide, forced expiratory volume in 1  second, atelectasis, adverse events, <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> stay, and actual postoperative stay. ResultsA total of 129 patients were randomly allocated to bilevel positive airway pressure (66) or usual care (63). Three patients allocated to bilevel positive airway pressure withdrew. The median duration of bilevel positive airway pressure was 16  hours (interquartile range, 11 - 19). The median duration of hospital stay until fit for discharge was 5  days for the bilevel positive airway pressure group (interquartile range, 4 - 6) and  6  days for the usual care group (interquartile range, 5 - 7; hazard ratio, 1. 68; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 08 - 2. 31; P = . 019). There {{was no significant difference}} in <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care,</b> actual postoperative stay, and mean percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1  second on day 3.

40|$|Levosimendan, a calcium sensitiser, has {{recently}} {{emerged as a}} valuable agent in the peri-operative management of cardiac surgery patients. Levosimendan is a calcium-sensitising ionodilator.

Current evidence suggests that levosimendan enhances cardiac function after cardiopulmonary bypass in patients with both normal and reduced left ventricular function.

The preoperative clinical course, preoperative data, and postoperative clinical course were evaluated. In addition, clinical parameters and postoperative clinical course were compared between children with Down syndrome (n =  8) and a non-Down syndrome group (n =  227).

The Macklin effect relates to a three-step pathophysiologic process: blunt traumatic alveolar ruptures, air dissection along bronchovascular sheaths, and spreading of this blunt pulmonary interstitial emphysema into the mediastinum. The clinical relevance of the Macklin effect was also evaluated. SETTING: A university hospital serving as a reference trauma center. PATIENTS: A selection of 51 patients with severe blunt trauma between 1995 and 2000. Inclusion criteria: Severe trauma or high-speed deceleration justifying chest CT; if chest CT demonstrated a pneumomediastinum, bronchoscopy and esophagoscopy were performed to rule out tracheobronchial or esophageal injury. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of patients' clinical files, chest CT, and bronchoscopy and esophagoscopy reports. The Macklin effect was diagnosed when an air collection adjacent to a bronchus and a pulmonary vessel could be clearly identified on the chest CT. Clinical relevance of the Macklin effect was statistically evaluated regarding its repercussions on the pulmonary gas exchange function, the respective <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> and total hospital stay, and the associated injuries. RESULTS: Twenty (39 %) Macklin effects and 5 tracheobronchial injuries (10 %) were identified. One tracheobronchial injury occurred simultaneously with the Macklin effect.

40|$|Background: Former {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that health-related quality of life is decreased in severely injured patients. However, in those studies patients were asked about their functioning and not about their (dis) contentment concerning their functioning. Little is known about how severely injured patients experience their quality of life (QOL). The objective of this cross-sectional study was to measure this subjective QOL of severely injured patients after their rehabilitation phase and to examine which accident- and patient-related factors affect the QOL of these patients. Methods: Patients of 18 years or older with an injury severity score (ISS) above 15 were included 15 - 53 months after their accident. Comorbidity before the accident, accident and sociodemographic characteristics, and QOL were obtained from the trauma registry and questionnaires. The WHOQOL-BREF was used to measure QOL. A reference group of the Dutch general population was used for comparison. Results: The participation rate was 61 % (n = 173). Compared with the reference data, severely injured patients experienced a significantly worse QOL in all domains except social relations. The QOL scores were significantly decreased in all domains for patients with intracranial injury in combination with other injuries. Patients with a severe intracranial injury (AIS > 3) only reported significantly impaired QOL in the general and physical domains. Patients who resumed working or lived with others had significantly higher scores in all domains of QOL than patients who did not work anymore or were living alone. Significantly lower QOL scores were obtained from patients with comorbidity before the accident and from patients with longer <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> unit (ICU) treatment or hospitalisation. Gender, accident characteristics and time since the accident {{did not appear to be}} important for experienced QOL. Conclusions: The experience of impaired QOL appears to depend on living alone, inability to return to work and pre-accidental comorbidity rather than on the injured body area or the severity <b>of</b> the injury. <b>Duration</b> <b>of</b> hospital or ICU stay is important to subsequent QOL, even if ISS or body region is not...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{study the}} {{long-term}} neurodevelopmental effects of hyperglycemia in infant bypass surgery for {{congenital heart disease}} (CHD). STUDY DESIGN Prospective cohort study on neurodevelopmental outcome after infant cardiac bypass surgery. EXCLUSION CRITERIA age older than 1 year at first surgery, genetic comorbidity, and birth weight 8 mmol/L) in 21 (14 %) children in the first 24 postoperative hours. Glucose levels normalized in all children within 48 hours, 7 children (4 %) received insulin infusions. Mean total IQ was within the normal range, but {{significantly lower than the}} normal population (92. 5 [SD 15. 0], P <. 001). Higher postoperative glucose levels were related to better cognitive performance in the univariate analysis (P <. 03), but not when other risk factors were taken into account. Independent risk factors for adverse outcome were lower socioeconomic status, higher risk adjustment for congenital heart surgery score, and longer <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> stay. CONCLUSION Hyperglycemia is common in the early postoperative course after infant bypass surgery for CHD and normalizes within 48 hours. Hyperglycemia has no adverse effect on long-term neurodevelopmental outcome...|$|E
40|$|The {{postoperative}} low {{cardiac output}} {{is one of}} the most important complications following cardiac surgery and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The condition requires inotropic support to achieve adequate hemodynamic status and tissue perfusion. While catecholamines are utilised as a standard therapy in cardiac surgery, their use is limited due to increased oxygen consumption. Levosimendan is calcium sensitising inodilatator expressing positive inotropic effect by binding with cardiac troponin C without increasing oxygen demand. Furthermore, the drug opens potassium ATP (KATP) channels in cardiac mitochondria and in the vascular muscle cells, showing cardioprotective and vasodilator properties, respectively. In the past decade, levosimendan demonstrated promising results in treating patients with reduced left ventricular function when administered in peri- or post- operative settings. In addition, pre-operative use of levosimendan in patients with severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction may reduce the requirements for postoperative inotropic support, mechanical support, <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> unit stay as well as hospital stay and a decrease in post-operative mortality. However, larger studies are needed to clarify clinical advantages of levosimendan versus conventional inotropes...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} what complications children have during interhospital transfer for intensive care, {{and how often}} these complications occur. DESIGN [...] Observational study of all children transferred over a six month period, including interviews with patient escort, patient review, and severity of illness scoring. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Timing and method of transport; complications occurring during transport; the equipment and experience of the escort; patient vital signs and paediatric risk of mortality score on admission; outcome and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care.</b> RESULTS [...] Forty two (75 %) of 56 children had adverse clinical events during transport. In 13 the event was life threatening. Inadequate circulatory and ventilatory support, inadequate monitoring, equipment failures, and drug errors were common. Children who subsequently died {{were more likely to}} have had complicated transfers than those who survived. CONCLUSIONS [...] Most children had adverse clinical events during transfer for intensive care. A number are transported by inexperienced staff with inadequate or malfunctioning equipment. Standards for patient management and monitoring during transfer need to be established. To reduce unsatisfactory care during transfer, it is necessary to establish dedicated and specifically trained paediatric transport teams...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Minimally {{invasive}} {{mitral valve}} surgery through a mini-thoracotomy approach {{was developed in}} the mid- 1990 s as an alternative to conventional sternotomy, but with reduced trauma and quicker recovery. However, technical demands and a paucity of comparative data have thus far limited the widespread adoption of minimally invasive mitral valve repair (MIMVR). Previous meta-analyses have grouped various surgical techniques and underlying valvular disease aetiologies together for comparison. The present study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of MIMVR versus conventional mitral valve repair in patients with degenerative mitral valve disease. METHODS: A systematic review of the current literature was performed through nine electronic databases from January 1995 to July 2013 to identify all relevant studies with comparative data on MIMVR versus conventional mitral valve surgery. Measured endpoints included mortality, stroke, renal failure, wound infection, reoperation for bleeding, aortic dissection, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, readmission within 30 days, cross clamp time, cardiopulmonary bypass time and <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> unit (ICU) stay and overall hospitalization. Echocardiographic outcomes were also assessed when possible. RESULTS: Seven relevant studies were identified according to the predefined study selection criteria, including one randomized controlled trial and six retrospective studies. Meta-analysis of clinical outcomes did not identify any statistically significant differences between MIMVR and conventional mitral valve repair. The <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> ICU stay was significantly shorter for patients who underwent MIMVR, but this did not translate to a shorter hospitalization period. Patients who underwent MIMVR required longer cross clamp time as well as cardiopulmonary bypass time. Both surgical techniques appeared to achieve satisfactory echocardiographic outcomes. Pain-related outcomes was assessed in one study and reported significantly less pain for patients who underwent MIMVR. However, this limited data was not suitable for meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The existing literature has limited data on comparative outcomes after MIMVR versus conventional mitral valve repair for patients with degenerative disease. From the available evidence, there are {{no significant differences between the}} two surgical techniques in regards to clinical outcomes. Patients who underwent MIMVR required longer cardiopulmonary bypass and cross clamp times, but the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> stay in the ICU was significantly shorter than conventional mitral valve repair. 11 page(s...|$|R

30|$|Minimally {{invasive}} {{cardiac surgery}} (MICS) is a surgical procedure with alternate minimal access incisions, on-pump beating heart techniques, off-pump valve repair devices, robotics, and/or transcatheter devices [1]. MICS with lateral thoracotomy {{is used in}} various cardiac surgeries, such as mitral valve repair (MVR), aortic valve repair (AVR), and minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB). MICS with lateral thoracotomy is expected to reduce surgical bleeding, <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> intubation, <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> unit (ICU) stay and perioperative mortality [1 – 3]. However, if poorly managed, lateral thoracotomy is associated with postoperative pain and leads to complications, such as postoperative pneumonia [4 – 9]. Epidural anesthesia (EA) is the current gold standard for post-thoracic surgery analgesia. However, it is contraindicated for patients requiring anticoagulant or heparinization and leads to possible complications, such as epidural hematoma and neuropathy [10]. With increasing interest in regional block techniques, ultrasound-guided continuous paravertebral block (CPVB) {{has been shown to}} be effective and safe for postoperative analgesia after thoracic surgery [11 – 15]. In this report, we retrospectively examined whether CPVB was safe and effective in open-heart surgery.|$|R
