25|$|However, {{notwithstanding}} the grant of original jurisdiction, the Court has, through the years, assigned to lower courts {{such as the}} Court of Appeals the power to hear petitions for certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, quo warranto and habeas corpus. As a result, the Court has considerable discretion to refuse to <b>hear</b> <b>these</b> petitions filed directly before {{it on the ground}} that such should have been filed instead with the Court of Appeals or the appropriate lower court. Nonetheless, cases that have attracted wide public interest or for which a speedy resolution is of the essence have been accepted for decision by the Supreme Court without hesitation.|$|E

25|$|A {{million people}} in our country and abroad like songs like Kalinka, Katyusha, Smuglyanka and the other songs of the {{military}} years as well as The Day of the Victory, Dark Eyes, Vecherny zvon and Podmoskovnye vechera. All these songs are known because of the Alexandrov folk song and dance company and people want to <b>hear</b> <b>these</b> songs at every concert. They are not just part of our history; they are great masterpieces. It is interesting that Svyaschennaya Voyna, written by Alexander Vasilyevich Alexandrov in 1941, helped Soviet soldiers to protect their Motherland and is still popular in Slovakia, Poland and Bulgaria. Those audiences listen to it standing up and it touches their hearts and souls.|$|E
500|$|Hayley Beck of CWG Magazine gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} EP, saying [...] "Honestly I could <b>hear</b> <b>these</b> songs being played in a nightclub, and I definitely never would've imagined myself dancing around to a Lifehouse track!" [...] She continues to describe the album, and describes the vocals as [...] "coarse vocals laid over a dancingly, mellow beat." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1977, [...] "Sheena Is a Punk Rocker" [...] was {{released}} as a single, being an outtake from the band's previous release, Leave Home. This period was extremely significant to the punk rock genre, {{as it was the}} initial wave of New York City's underground punk bands receiving recording contracts. New York-based clubs CBGB and Max's Kansas City began to see bigger audiences crowd in to <b>hear</b> <b>these</b> bands. Punk fans commonly believed that this musical style would soon top the market, to which author Tom Carson explains: [...] "To be in New York that summer was to have some sense of what it might have been like to live in San Francisco in 1966 or '67, or in London when the Beatles and the [...] Stones first hit." ...|$|E

500|$|It {{was this}} concept which {{intrigued}} Madonna, {{while she was}} developing her third studio album True Blue (1986). She said, [...] "I hate it when people do master mixes of my records. I don't want to hear my songs changed like that. I don't know that I like it, people screwing with my records. The jury is out on it for me. But the fans like it, and really, this one was for the fans, for {{the kids in the}} clubs who wanted to <b>hear</b> <b>these</b> songs in a fresh new way." [...] She went to Warner with the idea of releasing her songs by remixing them in a complete dance tune. From Warner's point of view, the rise of remix was a commercial boon, because it meant making more money out of the same piece of music. Instead of paying Madonna to go to studio and record different tracks, they found that allowing her to record the same tracks in different formats was much less costly. Hence they decided to release the album, but gave full freedom to Madonna to choose the producers with whom she wanted to develop the remixes.|$|E
500|$|After {{publishing}} two novels, Dead Men Tell No Tales in 1899 and Peccavi in 1900, Hornung {{published a}} second collection of Raffles stories, The Black Mask, in 1901. The nearly broke Manders is told {{to apply for}} the post of a nurse to an elderly invalid, who then reveals himself to be Raffles, who, as Manders describes, had [...] "aged twenty years; he looked fifty at the very least. His hair was white; there was no trick about that; and his face was another white. The lines about the corners of the eyes and mouth were both many and deep". In the final story of the collection, [...] "The Knees of the Gods", Raffles and Manders enlist in the army to fight in the Second Boer War; the story closes with Manders wounded and Raffles killed. The critics again complained about the criminal aspect; The Spectator declared [...] "this sort of book presents crime in a form too entertaining and attractive to be moral", while the reviewer for The Illustrated London News thought that Hornung's [...] "invention has obviously flagged... It is laughable, in a sense which the author never intended, to <b>hear</b> <b>these</b> burglars rant about the honour of Old England. It is a pity that the man who wrote Peccavi should stoop to this".|$|E
500|$|In early 1873, {{the navy}} created the {{civilian}} post of Inspector of Naval Bands, with a rank of Collegiate Assessor, and appointed Rimsky-Korsakov. This kept {{him on the}} navy payroll and listed on the roster of the Chancellery of the Navy Department but allowed him to resign his commission. The composer commented, [...] "I parted with delight with both my military status and my officer's uniform", he later wrote. [...] "Henceforth I was a musician officially and incontestably." [...] As Inspector, Rimsky-Korsakov applied himself with zeal to his duties. He visited naval bands throughout Russia, supervised the bandmasters and their appointments, reviewed the bands' repertoire, and inspected {{the quality of their}} instruments. He wrote a study program for a complement of music students who held navy fellowships at the Conservatory, and acted as an intermediary between the Conservatory and the navy. He also indulged in a long-standing desire to familiarize himself with the construction and playing technique of orchestral instruments. These studies prompted him to write a textbook on orchestration. He used the privileges of rank to exercise and expand upon his knowledge. He discussed arrangements of musical works for military band with bandmasters, encouraged and reviewed their efforts, held concerts at which he could <b>hear</b> <b>these</b> pieces, and orchestrated original works, and works by other composers, for military bands.|$|E

500|$|Weezer {{received}} generally favorable reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns {{a rating}} out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73 out of 100. AllMusic senior writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, {{who gave the}} album a [...] rating of {{four and a half}} stars, stated that [...] "this may seem like nothing special -- it's just punk-pop, delivered without much dynamic range but with a whole lot of hooks -- but nobody else does it this [...] so well, no matter how many bands try." [...] PopMatters' writer Jason Thompson also gave the album a positive review, praising the decision of the band to have Ric Ocasek produce them again: [...] "The guitar solos ring out as joyful as the words. And even the songs' lengths are nice and compact. Weezer comes in, plays the song, and exits. No overkill makes for many moments where you want to <b>hear</b> <b>these</b> songs again and again. Perhaps having producer Ric Ocasek back on board {{was one of the best}} ideas the band had, as the Green Album is certainly water tight all around." [...] Drowned in Sound gave the album a very positive review, saying [...] "After creating the two greatest pop-rock records in existence it's time to add a third. One listen to the Green Album has you eating out of Rivers Cuomo's hand just like in the past. [...] Rivers Cuomo is one of the greatest song-writers that has picked up a guitar. Anyone who can with hold the charms of the Geek-rock quartet are obviously made of stone and complete assholes. Sorry to be blunt but it's the way it is. God I think the sun's finally taking its toll." [...] The album would later rank at number 3 in their list of the best albums of 2001, tying with System of a Down's Toxicity and Mogwai's Rock Action. Q listed Weezer as one of the best 50 albums of 2001.|$|E

2500|$|There is some {{controversy}} {{as to whether}} or not Young considered Adam–God to be official church doctrine.

[...] Nevertheless, in 1854, after a great deal of controversy concerning the doctrine, Young minimized the importance of the doctrine, stating that the [...] "subject ... does not immediately concern yours or my welfare .... I do not pretend to say that the items of doctrine and ideas I shall advance are necessary for the people to know".|$|E
2500|$|Hip hop {{was thought}} to have {{originally}} become popular in Japan because the Japanese people wanted to imitate African-Americans.

They came to love the entire hip hop culture, including the loose-fitting clothes, graffiti writing, and break dancing. Some Japanese hip-hop fans would even go to tanning salons to darken their skin, and style their hair in afros or dreadlocks to imitate the [...] "cool" [...] looks of African-Americans, although they are ridiculed by others, including other hip-hoppers.|$|E

2500|$|The {{sounds that}} are heard in {{everyday}} life are not characterized by a single frequency. Instead, they consist of a sum of pure sine frequencies, each one at a different amplitude. When humans <b>hear</b> <b>these</b> frequencies simultaneously, we can recognize the sound. This is true for both [...] "non-musical" [...] sounds (e.g. water splashing, leaves rustling, etc) and for [...] "musical sounds" [...] (e.g. a piano note, a bird's tweet, etc). This set of parameters (frequencies, their relative amplitudes, and how the relative amplitudes change over time) are encapsulated by the timbre of the sound. Fourier analysis is the technique {{that is used to}} determine these exact timbre parameters from an overall sound signal; conversely, the resulting set of frequencies and amplitudes is called the Fourier series of the original sound signal.|$|E
