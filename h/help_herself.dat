5|$|Basing {{the plot}} {{partially}} {{on a story}} told to her by a stranger, Kim began {{an early version of}} 12 Days as a sophomore in college to <b>help</b> <b>herself</b> cope with the end of a relationship. After moving on emotionally with her break-up, she stopped developing the comic and later left South Korea to attend the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan, New York, United States, from which she graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in cartooning. Following her successful pitch of 12 Days to manga publisher Tokyopop, she resumed work on it in early 2005 and finished in the middle of August 2006. 12 Days focuses on Jackie Yuen, who decides to drink the ashes of her former lover for twelve days in beverages as a way to cope with her grief over her death.|$|E
500|$|Rhys is {{introduced}} in the first episode of the series (2006) as the unspectacular boyfriend of police constable Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles). When Gwen takes a new job with the Torchwood Institute's Cardiff branch as an alien hunter, she is forced {{to keep it a}} secret. Over the course of the first series Rhys shows increasing irritation with Gwen's evasiveness and long hours, and her ease and readiness to lie to him. Unknown to Rhys, Gwen establishes a sexual relationship with Owen Harper (Burn Gorman) to <b>help</b> <b>herself</b> deal with her secret double-life. She confesses the affair after it ends in [...] "Combat" [...] but drugs Rhys with an amnesia pill so he will not remember her confession. Rhys is murdered by Bilis Manger (Murray Melvin) in [...] "End of Days", but this event is erased from history after the Torchwood team reset time by opening the space-time rift located in Cardiff.|$|E
500|$|Manning {{supplemented}} {{her book}} writing by reviewing for The Spectator, The Sunday Times, The Observer, Punch and others, {{as well as}} making occasional contributions to the Palestine Post. Her fourth novel, A Different Face, was published in 1953. Set in a drab city based on Manning's hometown of Portsmouth, it chronicled the main character's attempts to leave his birthplace. The book was not well-reviewed, and as was frequently the case, Manning felt slighted, feeling {{that she did not}} get the reviews she deserved. Neurotic self-doubt and perfectionism made her difficult and easily offended, and she was very aware of younger writers outstripping her. Such an author was Iris Murdoch, with whom Manning shared an interest in flying saucers and an uneasy friendship that was tinged with jealousy at the younger Murdoch's greater success. Manning knew that she was spiteful, but could not <b>help</b> <b>herself,</b> frequently critiquing writer friends to others. However, she consistently praised and admired Ivy Compton-Burnett to whom she had been introduced in 1945, and whose friendship she greatly valued. She complained about her publisher Heinemann and her lack of recognition from her peers: Anthony Powell called her [...] "the world's worst grumbler", and the publisher remembered that she was [...] "never an easy author to handle." [...] A friend gave her the nickname [...] "Olivia Moaning", which was picked up by others, much to Manning's annoyance.|$|E

2500|$|Talking {{about the}} episode showing Kat's lover {{providing}} them with a flat to use, an EastEnders source told Inside Soap that Kat tries to resist him, but although she knows it is wrong, she cannot <b>help</b> <b>herself.</b> They said the flat [...] "really elavates things to a new level. This isn't just a dalliance any more—it's a full blown affair!" [...] Later, Alfie finds {{a key to the}} flat, about which a show source said, [...] "It's a foolish mistake, and it could well end up being Kat's undoing. With Alfie in possession of this key, the man can't get access to the flat—and if Alfie spots Kat with the same key, he'll be stunned." [...] It was reported that the first suspect would be eliminated in the week of 4 August 2012, with an insider saying [...] "There'll be a moment with the penny drops—and we'll all cry 'It isn't him!' It'll be a very simple moment, but utterly conclusive." [...] They added, [...] "at least eliminating someone at this stage will shorten the odds on the other four candidates. The intrigue is intense!". All About Soap said that viewers would be [...] "stunned". Ray was eliminated in the episode broadcast on 7 August. In mid-August, Newman said that the identity of Kat's lover would be revealed [...] "in the coming weeks".|$|E
2500|$|Fletcher’s lawyers {{argued in}} pretrial court {{proceedings}} that their client was {{not guilty of}} the charges. Their arguments {{were based on a}} viewpoint that the stories written by Fletcher did not meet the legal definition of obscenity. The legal definition of obscenity embraces both [...] "description", as in text, and [...] "depiction", as in images, stated one of Fletcher’s lawyers. In one of their briefs, the defense argued that Fletcher’s stories, however lurid, were comparable to many scenes found in literature and television. The novel A Clockwork Orange, by Anthony Burgess, and episodes of the television cartoon South Park were cited as such examples. [...] The defense also cited a scene in the novel The Apprentice by I. Lewis Libby Jr., the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, in which a 10-year-old girl is placed in a cage with a bear who forces himself upon her sexually to habituate her to sexual submission. The lawyers argued that Fletcher’s stories were no more lurid than the novel by Mr. Libby. Additionally, Fletcher's lawyers argued that she ran the web site for cathartic (medical) reasons in an attempt to <b>help</b> <b>herself</b> and others move past issues of childhood exploitation. The fact that Fletcher charged a membership fee was utilized to argue that Fletcher was not attempting to distribute the materials. Since the case was one of the handful of obscenity cases in the previous twenty years and it involved only text without visual images, First Amendment activists joined in the defense.|$|E

2500|$|Poirot {{reveals that}} the true murderer had been Elsa, who had become disillusioned and betrayed when she overheard Amyas reassure his wife {{that he had no}} {{intention}} of leaving her; he had made the promise to Elsa of doing so, merely to keep her from leaving so that he could complete his portrait of her, unaware that his model had taken his promise quite seriously. Although she falsely recalled the gist of this conversation, the mention of Caroline saying to Amyas, [...] "you and your women", showed to Poirot that Elsa was in the same category as all of Amyas' other, discarded mistresses, despite having been too young to realise this at the time, while he further notes that the remark made by Amyas of [...] "see to her packing" [...] was in regards to his intention to send Elsa packing once he was finished with his painting, and not about Angela; Caroline was distressed by his cruelty to Elsa despite his reassurances, and remonstrated with him on a second occasion about this. After overhearing their conversation, Elsa recalled seeing Caroline <b>help</b> <b>herself</b> to the coniine the day before, and stole some under the pretence of fetching a cardigan, which she then used on a glass of warm beer she provided Amyas; Poirot noted that his exclamation of [...] "everything tastes foul today," [...] meant that he must have drunk something already, before the cold beer that Caroline had provided, that had tasted foul as well. Amyas did not know he was poisoned until he began to become gradually weaker while Elsa was posing for his artwork, and that he knew by who by the [...] "malevolent glare" [...] he gave to the painting that Meredith had seen. Poirot notes the unusual vitality in the face of the portrait and says, [...] "It is a very remarkable picture. It is the picture of a murderess painted by her victim – it is the picture of a girl watching her lover die." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{took his}} {{seat at the}} breakfast-table full of these speculations; asked his {{daughter}} to put a lump of gold in to his tea, and on handing his wife a plate of slap-jacks, begging her to <b>help</b> <b>herself</b> to a doubloon.|$|E
6000|$|Anne {{could not}} get back her self-control. Her nerves were [...] "all strung up," [...] as she would have said. She {{had a feeling that}} she was right {{on the brink of a}} [...] "scene," [...] but she could not <b>help</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{could have}} laughed {{outright}} at {{the look of}} dismay on Mrs Griffith's face. The blow was sudden, and notwithstanding all her power of self-control, Mrs Griffith could not <b>help</b> <b>herself.</b> But at once she recovered, an angry flush appeared on her cheek bones.|$|E
