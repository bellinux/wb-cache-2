40|$|In São Paulo State, {{besides the}} {{occurrence}} of Candidatus Liberibacter americanus and Ca.

This phytoplasma is called HLB phytoplasma and was found widespread in citrus orchards, although at low incidence. The same phytoplasma was found in Sunn Hemp (Crotalaria juncea) in 2008 and witches’-broom was commonly found associated with 16 Sr <b>group</b> <b>IX</b> detection. The aim of this work {{was to assess the}} phytoplasma diversity in Sunn Hemp with emphasis at the detection of <b>group</b> 16 Sr <b>IX</b> phytoplasma and to establish an association between {{the occurrence of}} HLB phytoplasma and symptoms. Sunn Hemp samples were harvested close to the blooming period. Plants were selected in the field when showing symptoms common to phytoplasma infection. We employed universal primers do amplify phytoplasmas in general and group specific primers for 16 Sr <b>group</b> <b>IX.</b> PCR products were sequenced to allow grouping of phytoplasmas. We identified five phytoplasmas groups in 48 out of 99 Sunn Hemp plants, belonging to phytoplasma groups 16 Sr I, III, VII, IX and XV. The most abundant phytoplasma was the <b>group</b> 16 Sr <b>IX,</b> present in 70 % of the samples, found in central and north São Paulo State. The occurrence of HLB phytoplasma in Sunn Hemp samples, showing 100 % of similarity to the citrus phytoplasma, was highly related to virescence and the second most conspicuous symptom for this infection was witches’-broom...|$|R

40|$|In São Paulo State (SPS), {{sweet orange}} (Citrus sinensis) trees with huanglongbing (HLB) {{symptoms}} {{are infected with}} Candidatus (Ca.) Liberibacter (L.) asiaticus (Las) or Ca. L. americanus (Lam). However, in 2007, 3 years after HLB was first reported in SPS, some trees with characteristic HLB symptoms were found free of liberibacters, but infected with a phytoplasma of 16 Sr <b>group</b> <b>IX.</b> This phytoplasma was further characterized by PCR amplification of ribosomal protein genes rpsC-rplV-rpsS and amplicon sequencing. A qPCR test to detect the phytoplasma in plants and insects was also developed {{on the basis of}} the ribosomal protein genes. The phytoplasma was transmitted from citrus-to-citrus by grafting. The 16 Sr <b>group</b> <b>IX</b> phytoplasma associated with HLB symptoms in sweet orange in SPS and characterized by the above techniques was named “HLB-phytoplasma”. Although the HLB-phytoplasma is widely distributed in many municipalities of central, northern, and northwestern SPS, the number of HLB-phytoplasma-infected trees in each municipality is very small. Experiments have been undertaken to identify the origin of the HLB-phytoplasma and the source of inoculum on which a putative insect vector could become infected with the HLB-phytoplasma. In SPS, sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.) is a major, widely distributed cover crop. A 16 Sr <b>group</b> <b>IX</b> phytoplasma was detected in sunn hemp plants with witches’ broom and virescence symptoms, and was shown to have 16 Sr DNA sequences and ribosomal protein gene sequences with 100 % identity to the corresponding sequences of the sweet orange HLB-phytoplasma. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of phytoplasma cells in the phloem sieve tubes of infected C. juncea stalks. These results were taken as evidence that the sunn hemp phytoplasma and the sweet orange HLB-phytoplasma were identical. Scaphytopius marginelineatus, a leafhopper frequently found in sweet orange orchards, was shown to acquire the HLB-phytoplasma efficiently from affected sunn hemp plants, but acquisition from, and transmission rates to, sweet orange were very low. On the whole, these data suggest that (i) sunn hemp is a major source of inoculum of the HLB-phytoplasma, (ii) S. marginelineatus becomes infected on sunn hemp and transmits the phytoplasma to sweet orange, and (iii) transmission from sweet orange to sweet orange occurs only rarely, if at all. 16 Sr <b>group</b> <b>IX</b> phytoplasmas, very closely related to the SPS HLB-phytoplasma, have also been detected in citrus in Minas Gerais and Bahia states (Brazil) and Mexico...|$|R

40|$|A new FT-ICR {{apparatus}} (Fourier Transform - Ion Cyclotron Resonance) {{has been}} developed, where clusters produced in a laser vaporization supersonic cluster source were efficiently injected and trapped in an elongated cylindrical Penning type ion trap {{located in the}} center of a magnetic field of 6 Tesla. The successful injection of multiple cluster pulses into the ion trap makes the experiment largely independent of the intensity of the supersonic cluster source. Long trapping times of up to 30 minutes and a high mass resolution are additional features of this apparatus. In a first application, the apparatus was used to systematically investigate the chemisorption behavior of positively-charged group V and <b>group</b> <b>IX</b> transition metal cluster ions towards H 2. The absolute rate constant of the chemisorption process for the addition of the first hydrogen molecule as well as the saturation values for the complete hydrogenation of the clusters were measured. In the cases of Vanadium, Niobium and Cobalt, the reactivity of the positive cluster ions were then compared to the reactivity of the neutral cluster species. The patterns in reactivity for the positive as well as for the neutral clusters showed striking similarities. This led to the conclusion that the reactivity of these clusters is by and large independent of their charge state. Within the niobium and tantalum cluster series isomeric forms of a particular cluster species were found exhibiting a large difference in reactivity towards hydrogen. In the third series of cluster experiments performed on the FT-ICR apparatus, the chemisorption of CO on positively-charged <b>group</b> <b>IX</b> transition metal cluster ions was investigated. In the case of rhodium, the measured saturation values for these gas phase cluster carbonyls scaled parallel to the saturation values found for the rhodium carbonyl clusters in the liquid phase indicating similar structures for both gas phase as well as liquid phase clusters. In the presence of oxygen which is dissociatively chemisorbed on the clusters' surface, formation and desorption of CO 2 were found during the CO chemisorption process on all three <b>group</b> <b>IX</b> metals...|$|R

40|$|Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) is {{a member}} of the Solanaceae, one of the agronomically most {{important}} groups of flowering plants. We have performed an in silico analysis of 1. 15 million gene-space sequence reads from the tobacco nuclear genome and report the detailed analysis of more than 2, 500 tobacco transcription factors (TFs). The tobacco genome contains at least one member of each of the 64 well-characterized TF families identified in sequenced vascular plant genomes, indicating that evolution of the Solanaceae was not associated with the gain or loss of TF families. However, we found notable differences between tobacco and non-Solanaceae species in TF family size and evidence for both tobacco- and Solanaceae-specific subfamily expansions. Compared with TF families from sequenced plant genomes, tobacco has a higher proportion of ERF/AP 2, C 2 H 2 zinc finger, homeodomain, GRF, TCP, zinc finger homeodomain, BES, and STERILE APETALA (SAP) genes and novel subfamilies of BES, C 2 H 2 zinc finger, SAP, and NAC genes. The novel NAC subfamily, termed TNACS, appears restricted to the Solanaceae, as they are absent from currently sequenced plant genomes but present in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), pepper (Capsicum annuum), and potato (Solanum tuberosum). They constitute approximately 25 % of NAC genes in tobacco.

The corresponding agent {{was found to have}} highest 16 S rDNA sequence identity (99 %) with the Pigeon pea witches`-broom phytoplasma of <b>group</b> 16 Sr <b>IX.</b> Sequences of PCR products obtained with phytoplasma 16 S rDNA primer pairs fU 5 /rU 3, fU 5 /P 7 confirm these result.,;. With two primers D 7 f 2 /D 7 r 2 designed based oil the 16 S rDNA Sequence of the cloned DNA fragment, positive amplifications were obtained from more than one hundred samples including symptomatic fruits and blotchy mottle leaves. Samples positive for phytoplasmas were negative for liberibacters, except for four samples, which were positive for both the phytoplasma and `Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus`. The phytoplasma was detected by electron microscopy in the sieve tubes of midribs from symptomatic leaves. These results Show that a phytoplasma of <b>group</b> <b>IX</b> is associated with citrus HLB symptoms ill northern, central, and Southern SPs. This phytoplasma has very probably been transmitted to citrus from an external Source of inoculum, but the Putative insect vector is not yet known...|$|R
