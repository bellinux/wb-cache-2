25|$|A {{persistent}} {{problem in}} the soft drinks industry {{was the lack of}} an effective sealing of the bottles. Carbonated drink bottles are under great pressure from the gas, so inventors tried to find the best way to prevent the carbon dioxide or bubbles from escaping. The bottles could also explode if the pressure was too great. Hiram Codd devised a patented bottling machine while working at a small mineral water works in the Caledonian Road, Islington, in London in 1870. His Codd-neck bottle was designed to enclose a marble and a rubber washer in the neck. The bottles were filled upside down, and pressure of the gas in the bottle forced the marble against the <b>washer,</b> <b>sealing</b> in the carbonation. The bottle was pinched into a special shape to provide a chamber into which the marble was pushed to open the bottle. This prevented the marble from blocking the neck as the drink was poured.|$|R
25|$|The sealing {{materials}} of aluminum electrolytic capacitors {{depend on the}} different styles. For larger screw-terminal and snap-in capacitors the <b>sealing</b> <b>washer</b> is made of a plastic material. Axial electrolytic capacitors usually have a <b>sealing</b> <b>washer</b> made of phenolic resin laminated {{with a layer of}} rubber. Radial electrolytic capacitors use a rubber plug with a very dense structure. All sealing materials must be inert to the chemical parts of the electrolyte and may not contain soluble compounds that could lead to contamination of the electrolyte. To avoid leakage, the electrolyte must not be aggressive to the sealing material.|$|R
5000|$|The Fender Performer bass was {{a uniquely}} styled bass guitar, {{designed}} by John Page, {{renowned for its}} extremely slender neck (narrower than Stratocaster and Telecaster guitars). The Japanese Performer Standard has an alder body, with a bolt-on 34" [...] 24-fret micro-tilt adjustable maple neck and a 2-octave rosewood fingerboard {{as opposed to the}} United States-made Performer Elite, which sports an ebony fretboard. Controls are: Tone, Volume, Pickup Selector Switch and TBX Circuit Control (Treble Bass eXpander). The latter provided the same tonal range as the Jazz Bass between 0 and 5, with the range 5-10 providing significantly brighter sound - oriented towards solo playing and particularly suiting the sharp attack needed for a slap bass playing style. Both basses were available in Burgundy Mist, Gun Metal Blue, Candy Green, White and Tobacco Sunburst. All finishes were metallic except for the sunburst. Both versions featured a number of minor features underlying the 'high end' design including rubber inserts around the volume and tone controls, a high-quality fully enclosed jack socket, a then new and contemporary Fender logo, sculpted pickups marked with an (original) Fender logo, <b>felt</b> <b>washers</b> to prevent the strap buttons marking the body and individual intonation adjustment for each string as standard (many P-Basses at this time had just two bridge pieces).|$|R
50|$|Leaks {{are often}} {{repaired}} by plugging the leaking holes or using a patch to cover them. Leaking tires are often fixed this way. Leaking gaskets, <b>seals,</b> <b>washers,</b> or packing can be replaced. Use of welding, soldering, sealing, or gluing {{may be other}} ways to fix leaks. Sometimes, the most practical solution is to replace the leaking unit. Leaking water heaters are often replaced by home or building owners.|$|R
50|$|Enclosed pole {{buildings}} have exterior curtain walls formed by girts {{fastened to the}} exterior of the posts at intervals about 2 ft on center that carry the siding and any interior load. The walls may be designed as a shear wall to provide structural stability. Other girt systems include framing in between the posts rather than on the outer side of the posts. Siding materials for a pole building are most commonly rolled-rib 29-gauge enameled steel cut to length in 32 or 36 in widths attached using color-matched screws with rubber <b>washers</b> to <b>seal</b> the holes. However, any standard siding can be used, including T1-11, vinyl, lap siding, cedar and even brick. Using sidings other than metal may require first installing sheathing, such plywood, oriented strand board or boards.|$|R
50|$|In {{common with}} tanks of this period, but in {{contrast}} to crawler tractors, the suspension had considerable articulation and permitted high speeds. The Vigor was capable of nearly 10 mph, when the comparable Caterpillar D8 could only reach 5 mph. The four roadwheels were linked as two bogies on each side. Pairs of bogies on opposite side were linked by an articulated beam with a centre tilt pivot. This suspension required a flexible track and Vickers developed one with rubber <b>sealing</b> <b>washers</b> between the moving parts. This could be a drawback, as wear to the rubber in service could make the track floppy. Together with the great suspension articulation, if not well-maintained, the Vigor could be prone to throwing tracks when run at speed.|$|R
25|$|This system, {{invented by}} Albert Giblin and {{common in the}} UK, uses a storage tank {{similar to that used}} in the flapper-flush-valve system above. This flush valve system is {{sometimes}} referred to as a valveless system, since no traditional type of valve is required. Some would argue, however, that any system of regulating the flow of a fluid is still technically a valve. In the siphon-flush-valve system, the user pushes a lever or button, forcing the water up into the tank siphon passageway which then empties the water in the tank into the bowl. The advantage of a siphon over the flush valve is that it has no <b>sealing</b> <b>washers</b> that can wear out and cause leaks, so it is favoured in places where {{there is a need to}} conserve water.|$|R

One diameter of self-drilling screws and three different thicknesses of trapezoidal sheets were used. The applied screws were without <b>washers,</b> or with <b>sealed</b> or steel <b>washers.</b> The second experiment was performed in a laboratory furnace to check the catenary action of a thin-walled trapezoidal sheet. The basic theory tested in this experiment {{was that in the}} first phase of the fire the sheet behaves as a simply supported beam, while in the second phase the load bearing is transferred by a tension membrane. These experiments will be used to develop a design model of connections at high temperatures. High fire resistance of the trapezoidal sheet, dependent on suitable design of the screwed connection to the bearing structure, was confirmed. The experiment with the simple beam also confirmed catenary action. ...|$|R
25|$|The flyer is the {{original}} type of mechanical spinning frame and {{is believed to be}} a direct development of the Saxony wheel used in hand spinning. It is suitable for producing thick smooth yarns from coarse quality wools and hairs, but is falling into disuse because of the low speed at which the spindles have to run. As the yarn leaves the front rollers it is guided through a porcelain ring {{to the top of a}} revolving spindle, around and down one of the arms of the flyer and onto the bobbin. The bobbin is carried on a lifter plate and moves up and down the spindle. As the flyer revolves, imparting twist to the yarn, the bobbin which is free to rotate on the spindle is pulled round by the spun yarn. A <b>felt</b> or cloth <b>washer</b> is placed between the lifter plate and bobbin to retard the revolving bobbin and create adequate yarn tension for the flyer to wind the yarn evenly on the bobbin. When the bobbins are full they are removed and replaced by empty ones. This action is termed doffing and is done manually on this machine.|$|R
50|$|A blender {{consists}} of a housing, motor, blades, and food container. A fan-cooled electric motor is secured into the housing by way of vibration dampers, and a small output shaft penetrates the upper housing and meshes with the blade assembly. Usually, a small rubber <b>washer</b> provides a <b>seal</b> around the output shaft to prevent liquid from entering the motor. Most blenders today have multiple speeds. As a typical blender has no gearbox, the multiple speeds are often implemented using a universal motor with multiple stator windings and/or multi-tapped stator windings; in a blender with electromechanical controls, the button (or other electrical switching device or position) for each different speed connects a different stator winding/tap or combination thereof. Each different combination of energized windings produces a different torque from the motor, which yields a different equilibrium speed in balance against the drag (resistance to rotation) of the blade assembly {{in contact with the}} material inside the food container. A notable exception from the mid-1960s is the Oster Model 412 Classic VIII (with the single knob) providing the lowest speed (Stir) using the aforementioned winding tap method but furnishing higher speeds (the continuously variable higher speed range is marked Puree to Liquify) by means of a mechanical speed governor that balances the force provided by flyweights against a spring force varied by the control knob when it is switched into the higher speed range. With this arrangement, when not set to the Stir speed, motor speed is constant even with varying load up to the point where power demanded by the load is equal to the motor's power capability at a particular speed. The more modern version of this arrangement is electronic speed control found on some units.|$|R

Alumina is {{the most}} widely used oxide ceramic material. Its {{applications}} are widespread, and include spark plugs, tap <b>washers,</b> pump <b>seals,</b> electronic substrates, grinding media, abrasion resistant tiles, cutting tools, bioceramics, (hip-joints), body armour, laboratory ware and wear parts for the textile and paper industries. Very large tonnages are also used in the manufacture of monolithic and brick refractories. It is also used mixed with other materials such as flake graphite where even more severe applications are envisaged, such as pouring spouts and sliding gate valves. Sintering of alumina ceramics at relatively low temperatures to obtain dense and fine grained microstructures with sufficient mechanical properties is one of tecnological investigations. Alumina ceramics are extensively used for structural applications due to alumina’s high melting point, chemical stability, corrosion resistance and mechanical properties such as hardness and wear resistance at elevated temperatures. Restrictions to the applications of alumina arise due to the problems related to low thermal shock resistance and low fracture toughness.   In present day society, boron, an important element of both chemical and biological interest, has a variety of uses. Modern uses of boron-bearing minerals and boron derivatives include heat resistant glass (e. g., pyrex), fiberglass, ceramics, washing products (e. g., detergents and soaps), special alloys, fertilizers, fire retardants, wood treatment agents, insecticides and microbiocides. Colemanite (Ca 2 B 6 O 11. 5 H 2 O), a major source of boron mineral, is semi-soluble calcium-borate hydrate that is found in massive beds with other calcium containing minerals such as calcite and gypsium, and a variety of clays. Colemanite {{is the most}} important calcium containing commercial borate mineral with 5 mol crystal water. Direct use of colemanite is problematic for some industrial applications, e. g., in glasses and ceramics. Moreover, transporting raw colemanite and removing impurities and crystal water is expensive and energy inefficient, as colemanite must then undergo heat treatment before use, or the production process must be carried out under certain conditions. Ideally, the removal of impurities and crystal water at the same time will increase the use of the use of colemanite as amorphous B 2 O 3. Therefore, decrepitation or calcination is receiving increased attention. When raw colemanite is heated up to its decomposition temperature, only colemanite explodes, breaking up into a fine powder. This unique characteristic could be utilized in the upgrading of colemanite. Densification is the outcome of a combination of numerous parameters during processing, which include the powder characteristics, process variables, and sintering kinetics. The use of fine starting powder without agglomeration in the green preforms may improve densification. Regarding the latter, specific additives such as low melting oxides can be used to enhance the sinterability of powder. Additives in small amounts are deliberately and commonly used in ceramic systems to influence densification processes either by reducing sintering temperature or suppressing/promoting grain growth or enhancing mechanical and physical properties. Such additives can promote liquid phase formation at lower sintering temperatures and may considerably increase the rate of sintering. During sintering process, a viscous liquid may promote an additional diffusion mechanism of dissolution, particle rearrangement and capillary forces and finally may improve the densification. A variety of oxides such as B 2 O 3, MgO, TiO 2, SiO 2, MnO 2, Cr 2 O 3, Fe 2 O 3 are some of the typical additives that have been commonly used in alumina ceramics. The fundamental explanation of anisotropic grain growth in alumina is not totally understood but includes several proposals: inhomogeneous distribution of the dopant and the presence of a liquid phase on the grain boundary. In this study, initially, colemanite mineral which is found in our country as large scale deposits along worldwide, provided as concentrate from Eti Maden Bigadiç enterprices. The tenor of B 2 O 3  increased from % 33, 08 to % 58, 40 by decrepitation at 4500 C – 2 hours and dry screening processes after cooling down to the room temperature. The characteristic of the obtained colemanite powder determined by experiment studies and powder is processed for incorporating with Al 2 O 3 in order to produce structural ceramics. The experiments for powder characterization are laser particle size distribution, pycnometer density, arnold density, tapped density and chemical analysis before&after decrepitation for the colemanite powder. Afterwards, enriched colemanite powder added to commercial Alcoa™ alumina powder with the ratios of % 1 - 3 - 5. These powder mixtures pelletized by PVA for dry pressing and pressed at 175 MPa to obtain green samples. Green density measurements made for the obtained samples to compare with theorical densities. Pressed samples have been sintered at 13500 C, 14500 C and 15500 C for 2 hours and freely cooled down to room temperature. SEM scanning electron microscope has been used for investigating the microstructure of the sintered samples. Besides, water absorption rates, sintered densities, relative densities, XRD phase analysis and micro hardness values measured in order for investigation of the effects of colemanite added alumina structural ceramics.   Eventually, the examination of powder characterization and sintered samples characterization have been made and commented for the obtained results. After sintering at 13500 C, % 3 colemanite added alumina exhibits an increase in micro hardness values, % 1 colemanite added alumina exhibits an increase in sintered density values, accordingly undoped alumina. For the same sintering temperature and soaking time, when the addition of colemanite increases, grain growth is also increases according to the scanning electron microscope images. It has been investigated that, while the colemanite additions inside alumina increase, water absorption rates are also increase at the samples which are sintered at 14500 C and 15500 C. XRD measuring results shows corundum and aluminum borate structures obtained during sintering of the samples.   The results in this thesis have revealed that, the place of use where the porosity and hardness is not important like undoped alumina, 1350 C sintered and % 3 added colemanite to alumina products can be substituted for industrial usage. 200 C decrease in sintering temperature brings many advantages such as; saving up the energy consumption, highly increasing the working life of the sintering furnaces, thermal isolation elements and sintering casettes,  reducing amortisation costs of the sintering furnaces, also brings in an alternative for the investing lower temperature furnaces which are cheaper, substantially reduces maintenance, investment and production costs.
