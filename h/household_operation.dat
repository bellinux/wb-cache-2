40|$|Using {{data from}} the China Statistical Yearbook, trends in income {{inequality}} for urban and rural China are studied. According to our estimates, the overall Gini for China increased from 1980 / 81 to 2008. The rural Gini increased at an exponential rate of 1. 2 % while the urban Gini rose {{at a rate of}} 2. 7 %. To overcome weaknesses in the existing Gini decomposition methodology, we use the method developed by Podder and Mukhopadhaya (2002. The Changing Pattern of Sources of Income and Its Impact on Inequality: The Method and Its Application to Australia, 1975 - 94. Economic Record 77 (238) : 242 - 51).

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 The {{relationships}} between types of wealth components and consumption expenditures were investigated {{as a means}} of better understanding retired elderly household well-being. Specifically, the concept of mental account was used to identify the characteristics of different types of wealth components, and four mental accounts were identified: flow of investment, current asset A, current asset B, and future income. Based on the traditional life-cycle hypothesis, the behavioral life-cycle hypothesis, and neo-classical demand theory, the consumption functions for the total and 17 subcategorical consumption expenditures were formulated. These consumption functions were formulated to study linkages between household portfolio behavior during the working years and household consumption behavior during retirement. A tobit linear regression model was utilized to estimate parameters in consumption functions. The data were drawn from the Consumer Expenditure Survey, Interview Survey, 1990. The flow of investment mental account includes Social Security benefits, pension benefits, and transfer payments from public programs. The current asset A includes balances in checking and savings accounts, and the current assets B includes balances in stocks and bonds. The future income includes market values of home equity and real estate. The findings supported that the total and subcategorical consumption expenditures are the most sensitive to changes in flow of investment and the least sensitive to changes in future income. Further, among retired elderly households, the four mental accounts differ in influence on subcategorical consumption expenditures. The flow of investment was positively related to food at home, food away from home, utilities, <b>household</b> <b>operation,</b> clothing, transportation, entertainment, personal care, and cash contributions. Current asset A was positively related to health care, reading and education, and alcoholic beverages, and negatively related to food at home. Current asset B was positively related to clothing, transportation, entertainment, reading and education, and alcoholic beverages. Future income was positively related to food at home, utilities, <b>household</b> <b>operation,</b> and personal care. The research findings may help public policy makers understand or predict consumption expenditures as wealth components change in retired elderly households. Further, the economic well-being of retired elderly households should be discussed in terms of different types of wealth components rather than in terms of total wealth...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the results of a four-year research project (1997 – 2001) entitled ‘Housing as a basis for sustainable consumption’. The overall aim was to obtain more empir-ical and theoretical knowledge about the connection between physical urban planning and household consumption. This knowledge provides a platform for discussing principles and practices for sustainable urban development. This project was based on two main assumptions. First, it was suggested that the significant and increasing environmental damage due to private household consumption presents a major challenge in achieving sustainable development. Second, a large part of this consumption appears to be influenced by our physical living situation, i. e., the way we design and locate our houses. This also applies to energy use for heating and technical appliances, transport, and even to the considerable amount of equipment that is needed for <b>household</b> <b>operation,</b> redecor-ation and maintenance. With respect to transport, the study team included both everyday travel and leisure-time journeys in this research. While everyday trips such as travelling to work, shopping and taking the children to school are strongly influenced by the living situation of the household, this might also be true for leisure-time travel. Based on two large surveys in the Norwegian towns of Greater Oslo and Førde, the study team collected data on housing-related consumption from 537 households. Ecological Foot-printing was then used as an analytical tool to analyse the environmental consequences of this consumption. These ecological footprint analyses suggest that sustainable urban development points towards decentralized concentration, i. e., relatively small cities with a high density and short distances between the houses and public/private services.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston University. The {{economic}} {{problem of}} Greece {{is basically the}} persistent imbalance between resources and population. Previous attempts to establish the Greek economy on a long-run, sound economic basis by developing the domestic resources of the country fell short of their objective. In the past, the rate of resources utilization through capital investment, technological improvements, and institutional changes has been inadequate to support the growing population at a rising scale of living. Furthermore, post-war population growth may dissipate the economic gains achieved by foreign aid and may lead again to a new economic relapse. In Chapter I a concept of demographic equilibrium is developed which substitutes for the natural subsistence of the Malthusian equilibrium the concept of conventional subsistence and takes into consideration the attitudinal aspects of the people {{with regard to the}} scale of living. The objective of economic development is accepted as the establishment of conditions of demographic equilibrium achieved by a rate of resources utilization higher than the rate of population increase that results in a rising scale of living in accordance with desired standards. The approach in this study is historical and statistical. The objective is to analyze the direction which economic progress has taken in the past and to observe to what extent previous attempts were successful or unsuccessful in altering the course of economic change under a continuously growing population. Present developments are better understood when they are observed through conclusions drawn from past experience. The importance of natural resources is emphasized in Chapter II. The belief held among geographers that Greece constitutes an integral part of a world region termed AEgeis, a region occupying the greatest part of the eastern Mediterranean basin, cannot be explained without the presence of limited domestic resources on the Greek peninsula. These limited resources forced the surplus population to colonize and contributed to an economic prosperity based principally on transport-commerce- service activities. In the long history of Greece, the economic prosperity of the Greek peninsula was externally conditioned, depending on the changing economic significance of the region. In Chapter III a statistical analysis is conducted concerning the extent and nature of Greece's dependence on foreign trade. The propensity to trade and the per capita trade of Greece are the highest in the world. Measurements reveal that most of the increase in trade was necessary for the support of a growing population at an almost stationary scale of living. The persisting imbalance between population and domestic resources is also evidenced by a chronic trade deficit. Increasing visible imports were not met by a corresponding increase in visible exports. The deficit was met by invisible exports and borrowing. Furthermore, the chronic trade deficit indicates that Greece has never passed the borrowing stage. A cyclical trade disequilibrium was superimposed on the secular trade deficit. Measurements show that both visible and invisible export receipts are relatively more elastic than import expenditures. The nature of Greece's trade dependence is further explained by the monocultural character of the economy and the fact that Greece is a small buyer and seller in world trade. Post-war foreign aid has contributed little in moderating this monocultural economy. Furthermore, World War II has created some unfavorable conditions for Greek trade. As the balance of payments is a limiting factor {{on the size of the}} investment program, high trade dependence seriously restricts the prospects for economic development, and the population factor assumes paramount importance. Further evidence of the persistent imbalance between resources and population is offered in Chapter IV. The Greek economy is investigated during the period of free migrations and trade (1828 - 1920). The population of Greece increased from 753, 000 to 5, 017, 000. About two-thirds of the increase came from territorial acquisitions. Excess birth rates and some net immigration account for the remainder. Economic conditions in the domestic economy remained practically stagnant. Limited land, a feudal-like land tenure, primitive methods in production, and lack of capital restricted employment opportunities in agriculture. Manufacturing was largely a <b>household</b> <b>operation.</b> Foreign capital, borrowed by the government on heavy terms, was mostly spent on unproductive undertakings and led the country into default. Close correlation was found between the increase in population and imports. Percentwise, visible exports declined, while emigrant remittances and shipping earnings rose in importance. Migratory movements were almost continuous, especially with Greeks settled along the Anatolian littoral. Extensive emigration, especially overseas, at the turn of the century was more than offset by repatriation and the influx of refugees, even before the compulsory exchange of minorities in the Balkans. It is most likely that the scale of living did not improve after the third default of the country in the 1890 's. This likelihood, together with the extensive overseas emigration, strongly suggests that conditions of demographic equilibrium were not established. The 1920 's witnessed a mass in-migration of refugees and the first inter-war attempt toward economic adjustment. This is the subject of Chapter V. Population increased qy about 1, 450, 000 to approximately 6, 472, 000 in 1931. About 300 million 1947 - 49 U. S. dollars of foreign capital entered the country. Yet, this reconstruction scheme was not successful. The refugee settlement, the agrarian reform, and rising excess birth rates resulted in uneconomic parcelation of the land and small-scale subsistence farming. Extensive cultivation accounts for the largest part of the increase in agricultural production. The growing imbalance between capital-resources and population is evidenced by the increase in labor-absorbing lines of farm production. Despite progress, manufacturing fell short of taking care of the large urban underemployment. Furthermore, manufacturing exports comprised a very small fraction of total commodity exports. A balanced budget, a stabilized currency, and a restored monetary and credit mechanism were an economic bonanza. The depression of the 1930 's put an early end to this first scheme. Greece fell into default again. Per capita real income never reached pre-World War I levels during the 1920 's. Even with milder or no cyclical effects at all, it is problematic whether the Greek economy would be able to export an adequate surplus to meet foreign loan obligations, much less maintain a rising scale of living. Chapter VI deals with the policy for economic autarchy of the 1930 's, which constitutes the second inter-war attempt toward economic adjustment. Total gross investments, mostly forced savings through bootstrap-like operations, are estimated at between 600 and 700 million 1947 - 49 dollars. Agriculture proper received first and most attention. The weighted index of agricultural production, 1928 : 100, averaged 211 in 1937 - 38. Despite the drive for intensive production, extensive cultivation accounts for most of the increase in output. The animal-vegetable ratio showed marked signs of declining. The gains in greater output were largely the result of high tariffs. An increase in industrial production was not followed by a corresponding increase in employment. During the 1930 's population increased by about 950, 000 to 7, 345, 000 in 1940 because of high excess births. Measurements estimate that Greece had a 1, 424, 000 "surplus" agricultural population. Most likely, per capita income did not reach pre-World War II levels. Deterioration of nutritional standards through a fall in the animal-vegetable ratio at the consumption level and inferior manufactured goods domestically produced behind high tariffs most probably have taken place. International accounts were balanced and employment opportunities increased, but the policy for economic autarchy fell short of establishing conditions of demographic equilibrium. The subject of Chapter VII concerns the third attempt toward economic adjustment through post-war foreign aid. Widespread destruction, guerrilla warfare, and political instability delayed economic recovery. Finally, by 1952 economic conditions were improved, and the first post-war stable government came into power. However, prospects for maintaining conditions of demographic equilibrium are not encouraging. From over 2 billion dollars of foreign aid, only about 450 raillion were invested in long-run developmental projects. The drastic cut in foreign aid for 1953 - 54 and the limited availability of capital from domestic and foreign sources emphasize again the importance of population. In the past, continuous population increase has underscored and aggravated the economic difficulties of Greece. Post-war vital statistics indicate that the population of Greece is increasing rapidly, from 10 to 12 per thousand annual rate on the 1951 population census of 7, 631, 000. Fertility decline depends on the slow process of demographic transition. Emigration on an adequate scale is neither easily attainable nor acceptable on general grounds. At the same time, a higher scale of living is not only socially desirable but regarded as a matter of social justice. The ensuing relative deprivation may result in widely spread social unrest with corresponding political and ideological implications. In the final chapter (VIII) a summary of the findings is made, together with the following concluding remarks: The present rate of resources utilization may prove to be inadequate to support the rapidly increasing post-war population at a rising scale of living. Even prospects brighter than those of the present with respect to availability of capital and the renewal of foreign aid for the continuation of the development program, or to the integration of Greece into a European economy do not justify the absence of attempts on the part of the government to control future population growth...|$|E

In terms of useful energy recovered from the fuels, estimates are that wood constitutes 41 percent while petroleum products constitute 59 % of the total useful energy consumption in the country. This is due primarily to the low energy recovery efficiencies of wood appliances vis-à-vis appliances used for other fuels. It is shown that locally employed charcoal making methods are also energy inefficient but other known processes are relatively expensive alternatives. It seems that wood {{will continue to be a}} dominant fuel for the foreseeable future and work should be directed at inter alia, improving wood-burning appliance efficiencies, charcoal stove efficiencies, and employing charcoal making processes which allow up to 70 percent energy recovery instead of the present methods which generally allow less than 10 percent energy recovery. Due to higher capital costs and the inherent larger capacities of such processing devices community scale plant sizes are suggested in preference to the very small scale <b>household</b> <b>operations.</b> Such plants would open up opportunities for manufacturing of acetic acid, methanol, and possibly other chemicals from wood and stimulate development of local technological capacity in addition to charcoal fuel production...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn Sub-Saharan Africa, fish ponds {{are often}} an {{integral}} part of farming systems but have suffered from a lack of viability and sustainability. The present study aims to understand the strategies used by fish farmers to overcome economic and environmental constraints. In 2008 and 2009, fish farmers were surveyed in Central and Western Cameroon, and the fish production systems were classified by cluster analysis. Four broad types were identified according to the complexity of <b>household</b> <b>operations.</b> The development of extensive systems (large-scale and low-input) in rural areas of central Cameroon is induced mainly by abundant available land. For semi-intensive systems in both regions (small-scale and highinput in the Western Region, large-scale and high-input in peri-urban areas of the Central Region), horizontal integration is not sufficient to make fish production profitable and sustainable. More intensive fish farms tend towards vertical integration, in which farmers establish close links with input suppliers. Main causes of low productivity of semi-intensive systems (1 - 2 t/ha/yr) are both lack of knowledge of fish farming principles by farmers and lack of technical improvement by extension agents and researchers which need to consider the local complexity of farming systems to develop and intensify fish production. The adaptation of development strategies to socio-economic and environmental contexts is a necessity to hope for an increase in fish pond aquaculture production in Africa...|$|R
40|$|Apart {{from the}} {{positive}} effects, which {{are reflected in}} the relative improvement of the quality of life, the way households satisfy their needs has a direct impact on many environmental problems. Among them are global climatic changes, air, soil and water pollution, excessive usage of natural resources and loss of biodiversity. Sustainable consumption belongs to the key elements of global movement for sustainable development. It can be characterized as consumer behaviour which satisfies the needs of current and future generations. Czech households influence the environment every day by doing their shopping, consuming and using various kinds of products and services, the way they spend their leisure time, by commuting to work and travelling in general and, last but not the least, by producing waste. Both the location {{and the size of the}} household significantly influence the environment as well. 30 to 40 % of environmental problems are caused by households. Thus, pro-environmental movements warn of the necessity to eliminate negative impacts of households’ behaviour. This paper analyses development tendencies of relevant indicators of <b>household</b> <b>operations</b> which have impact on the environment. The attention is paid primarily to consumption of electrical energy, water and food by households, usage of personal means of transport and production of communal waste. Time series statistical methods were used when assessing development tendencies...|$|R

This paper explores their role in <b>household</b> micro-enterprise <b>operation</b> and success in the rural low-income setting of Vietnam. We propose that social capital and political connections assist households in accessing resources necessary to establish and operate an enterprise. Using three waves of panel data on a large sample of households surveyed between 2008 and 2012 we find strong evidence to suggest that both are important in assisting enterprise operation, particularly for the poorest households. Their role in determining the success of an enterprise is less clear with the evidence suggesting that conditional on enterprise formation physical inputs play a more important role...|$|R

There is a concrete example of a transnational company and its participation in a voluntary initiatives within the Czech republic depicted in this thesis, as well as its participation in the sustainability projects on an international degree. Also effects and impacts of these environmental projects mentioned above are included, concretely the environmental impact, the impact on consumers as a general public and the impact on the company as a participant of a project...|$|R
