5000|$|The {{reservoirs}} {{that hold}} water destined for a refuge {{are connected to}} the refuges by a network of channels, owned and operated by multiple entities. Similar to a network of roadways there are conveyance channels of many kinds (with names like: aqueduct, canal, slough and ditch) and sizes. Some channels are free to use by the RWSP, like rivers, and some require payment, such as those built and maintained by a water district. The RWSP negotiated contracts coordinating the delivery of water. Reclamation currently has nine long-term (15-50 years) conveyance agreements that are administered by the RWSP, one Service 40-year conveyance <b>agreement,</b> cooperative <b>agreements</b> <b>to</b> <b>reimburse</b> delivering entities for costs of conveying L2 and IL4 water supplies through federal, state, and private water distribution systems to the refuges and <b>agreements</b> <b>to</b> <b>reimburse</b> costs for groundwater pumping in instances where groundwater is pumped at the refuge itself.

50|$|From 1916 through 1972, the Wisconsin Public Service Corporation (WPS), {{a privately}} owned utility company, {{provided}} streetcar and bus {{service in the}} Green Bay Metropolitan Area. In the late 1960s, bus ridership decreases combined with rising expenses forced WPS to reduce deficits by cutting back on service. Service cutbacks, in turn, contributed to further decreases in ridership and even greater revenue losses, resulting in a downward spiral of service, ridership, and revenue. In April 1972, WPS offered to sell the bus company {{to the city of}} Green Bay with an <b>agreement</b> <b>to</b> <b>reimburse</b> the city for the full purchase price of $270,000 {{in the form of an}} operating subsidy over a five-year period. In January 1973, WPS was granted the right to discontinue bus service in the Green Bay Metropolitan Area, at which time the city of Green Bay leased the bus system from WPS through the remainder of 1973. This action avoided a discontinuance of service and allowed time for the city to create the Transit Commission, consider alternative plans for the system developed by the Brown County Planning Commission (BCPC), and prepare for a public referendum on the purchase of the system. On April 3, 1973, 71 percent of the public voted in favor on a referendum calling for the purchase of the system from WPS. In July 2015, Greyhound Bus service was added to the Green Bay Metro Transit terminal after Greyhound Lines moved from their old bus station located between Cedar Street and Main Street.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to {{establish}} a relationship between the unpredictability theory and the contractual liability, from both theoretical and practical point of view. Usually, the unpredictability is invoked by way of defense by the debtor, refusing to perform the excessively onerous obligation. However the unpredictability theory shall apply also to the hypothesis of a performed obligation, by way of main action, depending on more factors: the nature of the agreement, investigating the attitude of the party affected by the unpredictability. Observing the conditions and the effects of these two ways of invoking the unpredictability will form the objectives of the present study. The debtor of the excessively onerous, in order to avoid the contractual liability, shall nevertheless perform such obligation, by carrying along some additional costs. If subsequently, the creditor shall refuse <b>to</b> revise the <b>agreement</b> and implicitly, <b>to</b> <b>reimburse</b> the exorbitant costs, the debtor will have to raise the unpredictability by way of action, in order to recover the exorbitant costs in performing the obligation. In such case, the unpredictability is accompanied by another legal issue: the contractual liability of the co-contractor of the party affected by unpredictability...|$|R
