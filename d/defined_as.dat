5|$|Some {{types of}} dive profile have been named. An {{analysis}} of dive profiles logged by dive computers by the Divers Alert Network used categorization rules which {{were based on}} the fraction of the dive time spent in four depth zones: descent, bottom, multilevel, and decompression. The descent zone was <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> the part of the dive between the surface and first reaching 85% of the maximum depth. The bottom zone is the part of the dive deeper than 85% of maximum depth. The multilevel zone is ascent from 85% to 25% of maximum depth, and the decompression zone is less than 25% of maximum cepth. A square dive was <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> having more than 40% of the total dive time in the bottom zone and not more than 30% in the multilevel and decompression zones. A multilevel was <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> having at least 40% of the total dive time in the multilevel zone. All other dives are considered to be intermediate.|$|E
