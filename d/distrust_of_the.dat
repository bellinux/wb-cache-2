5|$|George's <b>distrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tories aided {{the passing}} of power to the Whigs. Whig {{dominance}} would grow to be so great under George that the Tories would not return to power for another half-century. After the election, the Whig-dominated Parliament passed the Septennial Act 1715, which extended the maximum duration of Parliament to seven years (although it could be dissolved earlier by the Sovereign). Thus Whigs already in power could remain in such a position for a greater period of time.|$|E
5|$|Gregorio Leti's Papal Nepotism, or the True Relation of the Reasons Which Impel the Popes to {{make their}} Nephews Powerful (1667) {{is one example of}} {{contemporary}} criticism of the institution of the cardinal-nephew; Leti holds the rare distinction of having all of his publications on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum ("List of Prohibited Books"). The Catholic Encyclopedia of 1913 defended the institution of the cardinal-nephew as a necessary countermeasure to the intrigue of the old Church. According to Francis A. Burkle-Young, 15th century Popes in particular found it necessary to elevate their relatives to the College of Cardinals due to their <b>distrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crown-cardinals, Roman baronial families, and Italian princely families who also populated the college.|$|E
5|$|The United States Capitol {{shooting}} {{incident of}} 1998 {{was an attack}} on July 24, 1998, {{which led to the}} deaths of two United States Capitol Police officers. Detective John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut were killed when Russell Eugene Weston, Jr., entered the Capitol and opened fire. Chestnut was killed instantly and Gibson died during surgery at George Washington University Hospital. Weston's exact motives are unknown, but he has a mental disorder and maintains a strong <b>distrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> federal government. He remains in a mental institution due to paranoid schizophrenia and has yet to be tried in court.|$|E

5|$|The {{blockade}} of the South caused the Southern economy to collapse during the war. Shortages {{of food and}} supplies were caused by the blockade, the failure of Southern railroads, the loss of control of the main rivers, and foraging by Union and Confederate armies. The standard of living fell even as large-scale printing of paper money caused inflation and <b>distrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> currency. By 1864 the internal food distribution had broken down, leaving cities without enough food and causing food riots across the Confederacy. The Union victory at the Second Battle of Fort Fisher in January 1865 closed the last useful Southern port, virtually ending blockade running and hastening {{the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|In {{a bid to}} stem Haidar's rise, the British {{formed an}} {{alliance}} with the Marathas and the Nizam of Golconda, culminating in the First Anglo-Mysore War in 1767. Despite numerical superiority Haider Ali suffered defeats at the battles of Chengham and Tiruvannamalai. The British ignored his overtures for peace until Haider Ali had strategically moved his armies to within five miles of Madras (modern Chennai) {{and was able to}} successfully sue for peace. In 1770, when the Maratha armies of Madhavrao Peshwa invaded Mysore (three wars were fought between 1764 and 1772 by Madhavrao against Haider, in which Haider lost), Haider expected British support as per the 1769 treaty but they betrayed him by staying out of the conflict. The British betrayal and Haider's subsequent defeat reinforced Haider's deep <b>distrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British—a sentiment that would be shared by his son and one which would inform Anglo-Mysore rivalries of the next three decades. In 1777, Haider Ali recovered the previously lost territories of Coorg and Malabar from the Marathas. Haider Ali's army advanced towards the Marathas and fought them at the Battle of Saunshi and came out victorious during the same year.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side, the HSP {{president}} Daniel Srb {{argued that the}} referendum was illegitimate since 71% of Croatian voters had not taken part in the referendum or had voted against the entry of Croatia into the EU, and warned that only 28% of Croatian voters had supported joining the EU. Srb also added that Croatian citizens had shown <b>distrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Croatian Government. Željko Sačić, a right-wing politician, stated that the government destroyed the concept of Croatian citizens and created an impression that Croatia was unable to govern itself. Sačić stated {{that the government had}} brought Croatia into a decaying organization in an illegitimate way, adding that the referendum result was a defeat of Croatian independence and they would challenge its validity in court. By the 3 March 2012 deadline, the Constitutional Court of Croatia received 22 appeals challenging the referendum's legality; it ruled against them all.|$|E

Because of this, Observer September (Michael Cerveris) says Peter never existed. Despite this, the Observers are aware <b>of</b> changes in <b>the</b> original timeline, with echoes of Peter appearing. December (Eugene Lipinski) charges September with assuring that <b>the</b> last memories <b>of</b> Peter are wiped out.

5|$|Romanticism {{has also}} been seen as {{affecting}} scientific enquiry. Romantic attitudes to science varied, from <b>distrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scientific enterprise to endorsing a non-mechanical science that rejected the mathematicised and the abstract theorising associated with Newton. Major trends in continental science associated with Romanticism include Naturphilosophie, developed by Friedrich Schelling (1775–1854), which focused on the necessity of reuniting man with nature, and Humboldtian science, {{based on the work}} of Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859). As defined by Susan Cannon, this form of inquiry placed a stress on observation, accurate scientific instruments and new conceptual tools; disregarded the boundaries between different disciplines; and emphasised working in nature rather than the artificial laboratory. Privileging observation above calculation, Romantic scientists were often attracted to the areas where investigation, rather than calculation and theory, was most important, particularly the life sciences, geology, optics and astronomy.|$|E
5|$|The Turks {{began to}} apply {{restrictions}} on Jewish immigration to Palestine in late 1882, {{in response to}} the start of the First Aliyah earlier that year. Although this immigration was creating a certain amount of tension with the local population, mainly among the merchant and notable classes, in 1901 the Sublime Porte (the Ottoman central government) gave Jews the same rights as Arabs to buy land in Palestine and the percentage of Jews in the population rose to 7% by 1914. At the same time, with growing <b>distrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Young Turks – Turkish nationalists who had taken control of the Empire in 1908 – and the Second Aliyah, Arab nationalism was on the rise, and in Palestine anti-Zionism was a unifying characteristic. Historians do not know whether these strengthening forces would still have ultimately resulted in conflict in the absence of the Balfour Declaration.|$|E
5|$|In December 1958 Ngo Dinh NhuDiem's {{younger brother}} and chief adviserbroached {{the idea of}} {{orchestrating}} a coup to overthrow Sihanouk. Nhu contacted Dap Chhuon, Sihanouk's Interior Minister, who {{was known for his}} pro-American sympathies, to prepare for the coup against his boss. Chhuon received covert financial and military assistance from Thailand, South Vietnam, and the CIA. In January 1959 Sihanouk learned of the coup plans through intermediaries who were in contact with Chhuon. The following month, Sihanouk sent the army to capture Chhuon, who was summarily executed {{as soon as he was}} captured, effectively ending the coup attempt. Sihanouk then accused South Vietnam and the United States of orchestrating the coup attempt. Six months later, on 31August 1959, a small packaged lacquer gift, which was fitted with a parcel bomb, was delivered to the royal palace. Norodom Vakrivan, the chief of protocol, was killed instantly when he opened the package. Sihanouk's parents, Suramarit and Kossamak, who were sitting in another room not far from Vakrivan, narrowly escaped unscathed. An investigation traced the origin of the parcel bomb to an American military base in Saigon. While Sihanouk publicly accused Ngo Dinh Nhu of masterminding the bomb attack, he secretly suspected that the US was also involved. The incident deepened his <b>distrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US.|$|E

40|$|Digital {{media has}} changed much {{of how people}} watch, consume and {{interact}} with digital media. <b>The</b> loss <b>of</b> indexicality, or <b>the</b> potential infidelity between an image and its source, contributes to a <b>distrust</b> <b>of</b> images. <b>The</b> ubiquity <b>of</b> interactive media changes aesthetics of images, as viewers begin to expect interactivity.

25|$|Studies such as Belief in Conspiracy Theories {{state that}} {{conspiracy}} theories {{relating to the}} assassination of JFK, the moon landing and the September 11th attacks are united by a common thread: <b>distrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government-endorsed story. This leads the believer to attach other conspiracies as well. Someone with a <b>distrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government will likely reject any and all stories or reports directly issued by state agencies or other authorities that are {{seen as part of}} the establishment. Thus, any conspiracy will seem more plausible to the conspiracy theorist because this fits with their worldview.|$|E

50|$|A {{predominant}} theme <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Shield is two wrongs don't make a right. Many episodes {{and story}} lines involve cover-ups by characters {{that lead to}} a more adverse situation.

40|$|Violence and {{insecurity}} are often read as totalising narratives of communities {{in parts of}} Latin America, flattening <b>the</b> complexity <b>of</b> everyday life and <b>the</b> responses <b>of</b> occupants who suffer from fear. In this article we draw on ethnographic research undertaken in los Altos de Cazucá in Colombia and in San Luis Potosí in Mexico. While both sites are distinct locations with different historic, economic, social and political contexts they share features of communities affected by violence {{and insecurity}}: <b>distrust</b> <b>of</b> institutions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state; rationalisations for managing violence in daily life; and narratives of fear that appear woven through <b>the</b> fabric <b>of</b> conversations. However, fear and violence are not all-encompassing experiences and individuals in both these communities describe practices of navigation of violence that draw on positive communal experiences. This article explores how, in these communities where violence comes to be expected but never normalised, people navigate their everyday lives...|$|R
