50|$|<b>Double</b> <b>helical</b> {{gears and}} {{herringbone}} gears are similar, {{but the difference}} is that herringbone gears do not have a groove in the middle like <b>double</b> <b>helical</b> gears do. <b>Double</b> <b>helical</b> gears overcome the problem of axial thrust presented by single helical gears by using two sets of teeth that are set in a V shape. A <b>double</b> <b>helical</b> gear {{can be thought of as}} two mirrored helical gears joined together. This arrangement cancels out the net axial thrust, since each half of the gear thrusts in the opposite direction, resulting in a net axial force of zero. This arrangement can remove the need for thrust bearings. However, <b>double</b> <b>helical</b> gears are more difficult to manufacture due to their more complicated shape.|$|R

Molecular models of native crystalline starch are currently being developed and the starch phosphorylating enzyme has recently been discovered.

Thus, the issue arises whether cooperativity in oligonucleotide-directed triple helix formation can be enhanced {{by the addition of}} discrete dimerization domains.
