5|$|Mulder {{telephones}} Scully {{and tries}} to explain that he's the real Mulder. Scully does not believe him and asks Fletcher—in Mulder's body—to pick up {{and listen to the}} conversation. Fletcher decides they should immediately report this incident, which further confuses Scully. She goes to Mulder’s apartment (where Fletcher is having a tryst with Kersh's assistant) and tells Fletcher that they traced the telephone call to a pay phone near Area 51 and she suspects it is Mulder's informant. Fletcher is indifferent to this news and Scully yells at him, sensing that his behavior is very strange and his lack of concern for the X-Files is completely out of character. Scully decides to investigate, and drives through the desert towards Area 51. She stops at a burned out gas station and finds a penny and a dime merged. Later, when Scully arrives at Fletcher's house, Mulder tries desperately to convince Scully that he is really Mulder. Scully remains skeptical and thinks that any information Mulder describes could be obtained in other ways. Mulder tells Scully that he will bring proof of the defect of the UFO and the resultant problems that night, but Fletcher, having <b>eavesdropped</b> on the conversation, calls his old office posing as Mulder to inform them of the source of the leak—Mulder posing as Fletcher. Military police arrive at the appointed hour, and Mulder is dragged away, kicking and screaming, desperately trying to convince Scully. Mulder asks if he would turn in an informant to the authorities in this manner as he is carried away, and Scully begins to realize that Mulder may be telling the truth.|$|E

25|$|A primary RFID {{security}} {{concern is}} the illicit tracking of RFID tags. Tags, which are world-readable, pose a risk to both personal location privacy and corporate/military security. Such concerns have been raised {{with respect to the}} United States Department of Defense's recent adoption of RFID tags for supply chain management. More generally, privacy organizations have expressed concerns in the context of ongoing efforts to embed electronic product code (EPC) RFID tags in consumer products. This is mostly as result of the fact that RFID tags can be read, and legitimate transactions with readers can be <b>eavesdropped,</b> from non-trivial distances. RFID used in access control, payment and eID (e-passport) systems operate at a shorter range than EPC RFID systems but are also vulnerable to skimming and eavesdropping, albeit at shorter distance.|$|E
40|$|Wireless {{surveillance}} {{is becoming}} increasingly important {{to protect the public}} security by legitimately <b>eavesdropping</b> suspicious wireless communications. This paper studies the wireless surveillance of a two-hop suspicious communication link by a half-duplex legitimate monitor. By exploring the suspicious link's two-hop nature, the monitor can adaptively choose among the following three <b>eavesdropping</b> modes to improve the <b>eavesdropping</b> performance: (I) passive <b>eavesdropping</b> to intercept both hops to decode the message collectively, (II) proactive <b>eavesdropping</b> via noise jamming over the first hop, and (III) proactive <b>eavesdropping</b> via hybrid jamming over the second hop. In both proactive <b>eavesdropping</b> modes, the (noise/hybrid) jamming over one hop is for the purpose of reducing the end-to-end communication rate of the suspicious link and accordingly making the interception more easily over the other hop. Under this setup, we maximize the <b>eavesdropping</b> rate at the monitor by jointly optimizing the <b>eavesdropping</b> mode selection as well as the transmit power for noise and hybrid jamming. Numerical results show that the <b>eavesdropping</b> mode selection significantly improves the <b>eavesdropping</b> rate as compared to each individual <b>eavesdropping</b> mode.

40|$|Abstract—The <b>eavesdropping</b> {{security}} of wireless ad hoc net-works has attracted considerable attention recently. However, most of current studies only consider OMN networks, where each node is mounted {{with a single}} omni-directional antenna, which radiates radio signals in all directions and consequently leads to the high <b>eavesdropping</b> possibility. Compared with an omni-directional antenna, a directional antenna can concentrate the radio signals on some desired directions {{so that it can}} potentially reduce the <b>eavesdropping</b> possibility. This paper investigates the <b>eavesdropping</b> {{security of}} wireless ad hoc networks equipped with directional antennas. In particular, we study the <b>eavesdropping</b> possibility of OMN networks, SDA networks in which each node is equipped with a simplistic directional antenna and RDA networks in which each node is equipped with a realistic directional antenna. More specifically, we identify the <b>eavesdropping</b> activity in wireless networks and propose an <b>eavesdropping</b> model to measure the <b>eavesdropping</b> possibility. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the <b>eavesdropping</b> possibility of OMN networks, SDA networks and RDA networks with considering various environment factors, such as path loss attenuation and shadowing effects. Our simulation results show that using a simplistic directional antenna or a realistic antenna in wireless networks can reduce the <b>eavesdropping</b> possibility. I...|$|R

40|$|To {{enhance the}} {{national}} security, {{there is a}} growing need for government agencies to legitimately monitor suspicious communication links for preventing intended crimes and terror attacks. In this paper, we propose a new wireless information surveillance paradigm by investigating a scenario where a legitimate monitor aims to intercept a suspicious wireless communication link over fading channels. The legitimate monitor can successfully <b>eavesdrop</b> (decode) the information of the suspicious link at each fading state only when its achievable data rate is no smaller than that at the suspicious receiver. In practice, such legitimate <b>eavesdropping</b> is particularly challenging, since the legitimate monitor may be far away from the suspicious transmitter and cannot <b>eavesdrop</b> efficiently. To overcome this issue, we propose a new approach, namely proactive <b>eavesdropping</b> via cognitive jamming, in which the legitimate monitor purposely jams the receiver so as to change the suspicious communication (e. g., to a smaller data rate) for overhearing more efficiently. In particular, we consider delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant applications for the suspicious data communications, under which the legitimate monitor maximizes the <b>eavesdropping</b> non-outage probability for event-based monitoring and the relative <b>eavesdropping</b> rate for content analysis, respectively, by optimizing its jamming power allocation over different fading states subject to an average power constraint. Numerical results show that the proposed proactive <b>eavesdropping</b> via cognitive jamming approach greatly outperforms the conventional passive <b>eavesdropping</b> without jamming and the proactive <b>eavesdropping</b> with constant-power jamming.

We propose a proactive <b>eavesdropping</b> approach, where a half-duplex monitor can opportunistically jam the suspicious link to exploit its potential retransmissions for overhearing more efficiently. In particular, we {{consider that the}} suspicious link uses at most two HARQ rounds for transmitting the same data packet, and we focus on two cases without and with HARQ combining at the monitor receiver. In both cases, we aim to maximize the successful <b>eavesdropping</b> probability at the monitor, by adaptively allocating the jamming power in the first HARQ round according to fading channel conditions, subject to an average jamming power constraint. For both cases, we show that the optimal jamming power allocation follows a threshold-based policy, and the monitor jams with constant power when the <b>eavesdropping</b> channel gain {{is less than the}} threshold. Numerical results show that the proposed proactive <b>eavesdropping</b> scheme achieves higher successful <b>eavesdropping</b> probability than the conventional passive <b>eavesdropping,</b> and HARQ combining can help further improve the <b>eavesdropping</b> performance.
