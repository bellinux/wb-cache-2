30|$|The present paper {{analyses}} {{the relations}} between <b>food</b> and oil <b>prices</b> for Malaysia using a nonlinear autoregressive distributed lags (NARDL) model. The bounds test of the NARDL specification suggests the presence of cointegration among the variables, which include the <b>food</b> <b>price,</b> oil price and real GDP. The estimated NARDL model affirms the presence of asymmetries in the <b>food</b> <b>price</b> behavior. Namely, {{in the long run}}, we find a significant relation between oil <b>price</b> increases and <b>food</b> <b>price.</b> Meanwhile, the long run relation between oil price reduction and the <b>food</b> <b>price</b> is absent. Furthermore, in the short run, only changes in the positive oil price exert significant influences on the <b>food</b> <b>price</b> inflation. With the absence of significant influence of oil price reduction on the <b>food</b> <b>price</b> both in the long run and in the short run, the role of market power in shaping the behavior of Malaysia’s <b>food</b> <b>price</b> is likely to be significant.|$|R

5|$|The Great Famine of 1315 began {{a number}} of acute crises in the English agrarian economy. The famine centred on a {{sequence}} of harvest failures in 1315, 1316 and 1321, combined with an outbreak of murrain, a sickness amongst sheep and oxen in 1319–21 and the fatal ergotism, a fungus amongst the remaining stocks of wheat. Many {{people died in the}} ensuing famine, and the peasantry were said to have been forced to eat horses, dogs and cats as well as conducted cannibalism against children, although these last reports are usually considered to be exaggerations. Poaching and encroachment on the royal forests surged, sometimes on a mass scale. Sheep and cattle numbers fell by up to a half, significantly reducing the availability of wool and meat, and <b>food</b> <b>prices</b> almost doubled, with grain prices particularly inflated. <b>Food</b> <b>prices</b> remained at similar levels for the next decade.

Secondly, while external influences do matter, South African <b>food</b> <b>price</b> movements are mainly due to domestic influences.

Thirdly, given the strong second-round impacts, <b>food</b> <b>price</b> movements warrant special attention in monetary policymaking. Core measures of inflation that exclude <b>food</b> <b>price</b> movements may not accurately reflect the underlying inflationary pressures in the economy and could compromise the attainment of the goal of price stability. ...|$|R

Although the system of fixed, artificially low <b>food</b> <b>prices</b> kept urban discontent under control, it caused further economic strain. In the long run the situation was unsustainable, and on 12 December 1970 (just before Christmas), the regime suddenly announced massive increases in the prices of basic foodstuffs, the government's main source of hard currency when exported. The new measures were incomprehensible to many urban workers, and their provocative timing (the most intense food purchase period for most Polish families) led to strong social reaction and ultimately Gomułka's fall from power.|$|E

30|$|In this study, {{we examine}} the {{bearings}} oil price has on the <b>food</b> <b>price</b> index for a net food-importing country, i.e. Malaysia. Recognizing potential roles of market power, cost structures and public policy schemes in shaping asymmetric behavior of the <b>food</b> <b>price,</b> we adopt a nonlinear ARDL model for the analysis to capture both long-run and short-run asymmetric relations between the <b>food</b> and oil <b>prices.</b> From the analysis, we find evidence {{for the presence of}} asymmetries in the long run {{as well as in the}} short run. More specifically, in the long run, an oil price increase tends to lead to the increase in the <b>food</b> <b>price</b> while the oil price reduction does not seems to be related to <b>food</b> <b>price.</b> From the estimated cointegrating vectors, we note the degree of pass-through from the oil price increase to the <b>food</b> <b>price</b> to be low and far from complete. Likewise, in the short run, only the changes in the oil price increase are significantly related to the <b>food</b> <b>price</b> inflation. These results are largely similar regardless of whether the oil price in ringgit or the oil price in the US dollar is used.|$|R

The major <b>food</b> <b>price</b> shocks in 2008 and 2011 impacted negatively on wellbeing, but even after 2011 prices continued to rise in most areas. Seasonal price movements also have adverse effects for resource?poor households. <b>Food</b> <b>price</b> rises have a particularly {{negative impact on the}} poorest households.

30|$|This low {{pass-through}} of {{oil price}} increase notwithstanding, it {{is a cause}} of concern especially to households at lower income quartiles. Over the past years, the upswings in the oil price have been sharp and, hence, can contribute quite substantially to the <b>food</b> <b>price</b> increase. As an example, {{in the year of}} drastic increase in the oil price in ringgit in 2008, the oil price jumped by almost 30 % from the preceding year. On the basis of our estimates, the oil price would account for the increase of roughly 2.4 % in the <b>food</b> <b>price</b> over the long run. This is high considering the average annual <b>food</b> <b>price</b> inflation in Malaysia of 4.3 %. Thus, given higher budget shares of households at quartile 1 (33.03 %) and quartile 2 (25.92 %), these groups would be more affected by the oil price increases than those at the upper income levels would. Moreover, as can be further noted from the Table, the long run relation between <b>food</b> <b>price</b> and oil price reduction is insignificant. This finding should be worrying since, while the drastic oil price increase is positively related to <b>food</b> <b>price</b> in the long run, its decline will not be translated into a reduction in the <b>food</b> <b>price.</b> In other words, the high <b>food</b> <b>price</b> will linger around even if the oil price has corrected downward after the initial increase.|$|R

Fearing domestic protest, Libya's government implemented preventative measures by reducing <b>food</b> <b>prices,</b> purging the army leadership of potential defectors and releasing several Islamist prisoners. They proved ineffective, and on 17 February 2011, major protests broke out against Gaddafi's government.

5|$|Political {{tensions}} {{amongst the}} working classes in Glamorgan had grown during the 1820s: although wages were impressive by contemporary standards during good years, they deteriorated quickly during depressions, plunging many into destitution; sanitation and health {{standards in the}} fast-growing industrial communities were appalling, child mortality rates were extremely high. 1831 saw a severe economic depression, with wages falling quickly and <b>food</b> <b>prices</b> rising, and complaints against the local debt courts and their bailiffs were numerous. Nationally, the electoral reform movement was making considerable protests and protests against the Corn Laws—which kept the prices of food high—were growing.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of <b>food</b> <b>price</b> volatility {{is really important}} in economics. Understanding why do prices evolve as they do and explaining what are the sources of price variations is a central question for economies worldwide, and especially for African economies. Indeed, <b>food</b> <b>price</b> volatility often appears {{as one of the}} fundamental characteristics of agricultural markets. Thus, without such information, forecasting price evolutions is very difficult and providing adequate recommendations to policy-makers becomes a challenge. The objective of this chapter is, on the one hand, to explain the various theoretical views of the determinants of <b>food</b> <b>price</b> volatility in the economic literature and, on the other hand, to measure <b>food</b> <b>price</b> volatility in Cameroon as well as to find out factors that influence this volatility. Specifically, the chapter analyses the trajectory of <b>food</b> <b>price</b> series and identifies the determinants of their fluctuations by using an ARMA, an ARMA-X, a GARCH, and a GARCH-X model. Unlike previous studies, we assume that <b>food</b> <b>price</b> volatility on Cameroonian markets is the result of domestic/local factors as well as external factors coming from the world market. Two main results have been found. First, although there is a general tendency to assert that <b>food</b> <b>price</b> volatility has increased over time, we were unable to confirm this hypothesis. One potential explanation relies on the fact that imported cereals have many potential substitutes in Cameroon. Second, <b>food</b> <b>price</b> volatility in Cameroon is mostly determined by local/domestic factors such as price volatility of other agricultural and non-agricultural products, and not by external factors such as price volatility of crude oil or imported cereals, as well as by specific political events to this country, but not by the 2008 food crisis; suggesting the existence of a low price transmission between international and Cameroonian markets. Consequently, the three recommendations aiming at policy-makers to reduce the impacts of <b>food</b> <b>price</b> volatility in Cameroon are the development and improvement of existing development programs or the implementation of specific projects supporting local food production that are substitute to imported food commodities such as local cereals or roots and tubers; the control of fuel price fluctuations in the country and the improvement of transport infrastructure; and the following of price behavior patterns of 3 commodities out of 7 and 3 markets out of 5 to have a good understanding on {{what is going on in}} Cameroon regarding <b>food</b> <b>price</b> fluctuations and volatility...|$|R
