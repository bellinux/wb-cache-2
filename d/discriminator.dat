40|$|Cooperation is {{ubiquitous}} in biological and social systems, even though cooperative behavior is often costly and {{at risk of}} exploitation by non-cooperators. Several {{studies have demonstrated that}} indirect reciprocity, whereby some members of a group observe the behaviors of their peers and use this information to discriminate against previously uncooperative agents in the future, can promote prosocial behavior. Some studies have shown that differential propensities of interacting among and between different types of agents (interaction assortment) can increase the effectiveness of indirect reciprocity. No previous studies have, however, considered differential propensities of observing the behaviors of different types of agents (information assortment). Furthermore, most previous studies have assumed that <b>discriminators</b> possess perfect information about others and incur no costs for gathering and storing this information. Here, we (1) consider both interaction assortment and information assortment, (2) assume <b>discriminators</b> have limited information about others, and (3) introduce a cost for information gathering and storage, in order to understand how the ability of <b>discriminators</b> to stabilize cooperation is affected by these steps toward increased realism. We report the following findings. First, cooperation can persist when agents preferentially interact with agents of other types or when <b>discriminators</b> preferentially observe other <b>discriminators,</b> even when they have limited information. Second, contrary to intuition, increasing the amount of information available to <b>discriminators</b> can exacerbate defection.

If the Rajah of Benares had formed a secret conspiracy, Mr. Hastings had a state duty and a judicial duty to perform. He was bound, as Governor, knowing of such a conspiracy, {{to provide for the}} public safety; and as a judge, he was bound to convene a criminal court, and to lay before it a detailed accusation of the offence. He was bound to proceed publicly and legally against the accused, and to convict him of his crime, previous to his inflicting, or forming any intention of inflicting, punishment. I say, my Lords, that Mr. Hastings, as a magistrate, was bound to proceed against the Rajah either by English law, by Mahometan law, or by the Gentoo law; and that, by all or any of these laws, he was bound to make the accused acquainted with the crime alleged, to hear his answer to the charge, and to produce evidence against him, in an open, clear, and judicial manner. And here, my Lords, we have again to remark, that the Mahometan law is a great <b>discriminator</b> of persons, and that it prescribes the mode of proceeding against those who are accused of any delinquency requiring punishment, with a reference to the distinction and rank which the accused held in society.

My mind was at one time so crowded by painful thoughts, that they shut out many others which are interesting to me; and among other things, I forgot once or twice, when I had an opportunity, to thank you, dear Mrs. Martin. I believe I should have taken advantage of your proposal, but papa said to me, 'If he criticises your manuscript in a manner which does not satisfy you, you won't be easy without defending yourself, and he might be drawn into taking more trouble than you have now any idea of giving him.' I sighed a little at losing such an opportunity of gaining a great advantage, but there seemed to be some reason in what papa said I have completed a preface and notes to my translation; and since doing so, a work of exactly the same character by a Mr. Medwin has been published, and commended in Bulwer's magazine.[14] Therefore it is probable enough that my trouble, excepting as far as my own amusement went, has been in vain. But papa means to try Mr. Valpy, I believe. He left us since I began to write this letter, with a promise of returning before Christmas Day. We do miss him. Mr. Boyd has made me quite angry by publishing his translations by rotation in numbers of the 'Wesleyan Magazine,' instead of making them up into a separate publication, as I had persuaded him to do. There is the effect, you see, of going, even for a time, out of my reach! The readers of the 'Wesleyan Magazine' are pious people, but not cultivated, nor, for the most part, capable of estimating either the talents of Gregory or his translator's. I have begun already to insist upon another publication in a separate form, and shall gain my point, I dare say. I have been reading Bulwer's novels and Mrs. Trollope's libels, and Dr. Parr's works. I am sure you are not an admirer of Mrs. Trollope's. She has neither the delicacy nor the candour which constitute true nobility of mind and her extent of talent forms but a scanty veil to shadow her other defects. Bulwer has quite delighted me. He has all the dramatic talent which Scott has, and all the passion which Scott has not, and he appears to me to be besides a far profounder <b>discriminator</b> of character.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explored four denotative measurement <b>discriminators</b> {{to examine}} how these <b>discriminators</b> interrelate with the CASE/I-CASE technologies. The purpose of studying this interrelationship was to show how these <b>discriminators</b> can be key {{in the assessment of}} a CASEII-CASE environment in a software developing organization. The measurement <b>discriminators</b> presented in this study were: software metrics, usability evaluations, software maturity levels, and organizational change indicators. One of the largest users and developers of software is the Department of Defense (DOD). Compounding the DOD 2 ̆ 7 s principal mission is the maintenance, reliability, quality, and procurement of complex software that has forced DOD to search out innovative software development environments. DOD had ventured to investigate the promises of these technologies. To assist DOD and the software industry at large, this dissertation postulated that using the four measurement <b>discriminators</b> will assist a software developing organization to determine its readiness to use CASEII-CASE. Using the nineteen DOD I-CASE pilot sites as its sample population, the procedure involved collecting measurement data on software (metrics), software maturity, organizational change, and usability of the software development environment. Software measurement data included 2 ̆ 2 raw data 2 ̆ 2 on such items as effort (staff-hours), schedules, defects, and software size. The remaining measurement <b>discriminators</b> data collection vehicles were in the form of questionnaires. The results of this study were ascertained using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and multiple regression analysis. A strong correlation was determined within the questionnaires indicating that the questionnaires were reliable. The multiple regression analysis indicated that there was an interrelationship between CASE/I-CASE and organizational/software measurements. Implications of the study on the field and its contribution to knowledge included areas, such as, software engineering, decision support systems, measurement theory, and human-computer interface. Recommendations for future research were in the areas of computer supported cooperative work, software engineering teamwork and group problem-solving, object-oriented paradigm, and the multiple discipline fields of the measurement <b>discriminators...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} discrimination, which is a generalized form of partitioning, and present an expressive term language for defining equivalence relations on complex data. The language allows definition of equivalence relations by freely combining structural equivalence, equivalence of lists under commutativity, idempotence (bag and set equivalence), and more. We then show that worst-case linear-time <b>discriminators</b> can be defined generically, by induction on the term language, using multiset discrimination. By employing <b>discriminators</b> for base types such as characters and integer segments that sort their inputs, it can be shown that the inductive construction yields <b>discriminators</b> that both partition and sort their input in linear time {{for a wide range}} of total preorders. This amounts to generically bootstrapping pigeonhole sorting for a finite segment of primitive data to linear-time sorting of complex data. We show how these <b>discriminators,</b> both sorting and nonsorting, can be coded up compactly and elegantly using Generalized Algebraic Data Types (GADTs) and list comprehensions and give some examples of applications of the use of <b>discriminators.</b> Finally, we argue that discrimination should replace equality testing as a language primitive for built-in types and abstract types that wish to only make equality observable: they algorithmically generalize equality testing, which is basically just discrimination of 2 elements. <b>Discriminators</b> allow partitioning and even sorting of arbitrary size lists in linear time without comparison operations (as in comparison-based sorting) or arithmetization of the values (as for hash-based methods). Thus even references in ML could be discriminated in linear time instead of quadratic time, if discrimination were the built-in operation for exposing reference equality, not equality testing...|$|R
40|$|Mutualism {{based on}} {{reciprocal}} exchange of costly services must avoid exploitation by ‘free-rides’. Accordingly, hosts discriminate against free-riding symbionts in many mutualistic relationships. However, as the selective advantage of <b>discriminators</b> {{comes from the}} presence of variability in symbiont quality that they eliminate, discrimination and thus mutualism have been considered to be maintained with exogenous supply of free-riders. In this study, we tried to resolve the ‘paradoxical’ co-evolution of discrimination by hosts and cooperation by symbionts, by comparing {{two different types of}} discrimination: ‘one-shot’ discrimination, where a host does not reacquire new symbionts after evicting free-riders, and ‘resampling’ discrimination, where a host does from the environment. Our study shows that this apparently minor difference in discrimination types leads to qualitatively different evolutionary outcomes. First, although it has been usually considered that the benefit of <b>discriminators</b> is derived from the variability of symbiont quality, the benefit of a certain type of <b>discriminators</b> (e. g. one-shot discrimination) is proportional to the frequency of free-riders, which is {{in stark contrast to the}} case of resampling discrimination. As a result, one-shot <b>discriminators</b> can invade the free-rider/nondiscriminator population, even if standing variation for symbiont quality is absent. Second, our one-shot <b>discriminators</b> can also be maintained without exogenous supply of free-riders and hence is free from the paradox of discrimination. Therefore, our result indicates that the paradox is not a common feature of evolution of discrimination but is a problem of specific types of discrimination...|$|R
