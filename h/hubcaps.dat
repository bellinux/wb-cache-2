5|$|Omaha had terrible streets {{through the}} late 1880s, which caused many {{residents}} to believe the city was not progressing appropriately. This lack of responsiveness by the city government was caused by property owners throughout the city {{who did not want}} to pay for improvements. On rainy days stagecoaches would sink up to their <b>hubcaps,</b> and residents wore knee-high boots to wade through the mud, and at times rivers ran through the streets.|$|E
5|$|Above {{the third}} setback, {{consisting}} of the 24th through 27th floors, the facade contains horizontal bands and zigzagged gray-and-black brick motifs. Above the fourth setback, between the 27th and 31st floors, the shaft starts to appear. At each corner of the 31st floor, large car-hood ornaments made of Nirosta steel serve as visually striking objects that make the base look larger. These corner extensions alleviate a common optical illusion seen in tall buildings with horizontal bands, whose taller floors would normally look larger. The 31st floor also contains a gray and white frieze of <b>hubcaps</b> and fenders, which both symbolizes the Chrysler Corporation {{and serves as a}} visual effect for the building's Art Deco design. The bonnet embellishments take the shape of Mercury's winged helmet, which was modeled after the hood ornament installed on Chrysler vehicles at the time.|$|E

25|$|The fast-selling Rambler {{model was}} sold {{as both a}} Nash and a Hudson in 1955 and 1956. These badge-engineered Ramblers, along with similar Metropolitans, were {{identical}} save for <b>hubcaps,</b> nameplates, and other minor trim details.|$|E
25|$|The center-lock {{wire wheel}} is {{traditionally}} associated with vintage sports cars and racing cars, {{and for those}} of us of advancing years the blood is still stirred by memories of split-seconds saved by the deft application of copper-headed hammers to eared <b>hubcaps.</b> We also remember...|$|E

25|$|The car had {{drum brakes}} all round. Wheels were steel, dressed up with full-diameter chrome <b>hubcaps</b> and 4-ply 6.40×15-inch whitewall tires. The {{interior}} featured luxurious leather upholstery, foam rubber cushions, adjustable steering wheel, and a cigarette lighter. Completed vehicles were {{shipped to the}} United States for sale through the Nash dealership network.|$|E
25|$|From late 1975 to 1978 the Australian {{developed}} Statesman Caprice was marketed in South Africa as the Chevrolet Caprice Classic. The V8-engined Caprice Classic received full equipment, {{with reading}} lights, air conditioning, and imported leather upholstery. It {{was very similar}} to the 5-liter Constantia, albeit fitted with a different grille, <b>hubcaps,</b> and a vinyl roof.|$|E
25|$|In 1955 broad lower {{rear fender}} bands, gold-colored Roadmaster deck script and hood ornament, {{bars on the}} <b>hubcaps</b> and gold-accented grille were added to {{distinguish}} Roadmaster. Horsepower jumped to 236, and a new variable-pitch Dynaflow, in which the stator blades changed pitch under hard acceleration, provided quicker off-the-line getaway. Back up lights were now standard. Overall sales were 64,500.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1950s {{it was decided}} to use the Triumph name for {{sporting}} cars and the Standard name for saloons and in 1953 the Triumph TR2 was initiated, the first of the TR series of sports cars that were produced until 1981. Curiously, the TR2 had a Standard badge on its front and the Triumph globe on its <b>hubcaps.</b>|$|E
25|$|Standard had {{introduced}} a new badge in 1947 for their own models, first seen on the Vanguard, a highly stylised motif based {{on the wings of}} a Griffin. With the introduction of the TR2, a version of this badge appeared {{for the first time on}} the bonnet of a production Triumph, while the Globe continued to appear on the <b>hubcaps.</b> This same double-badging also appeared on the TR3 and TR4, the 2000 and the 1300.|$|E
25|$|When on the TV show Top Gear, {{presenter}} Jeremy Clarkson {{commented that}} Wold's car history of over 100 cars included a Morris Minor. Wold then presented a four-string guitar that his friend Davey Chivers had {{made out of}} two old <b>hubcaps</b> from a Minor 1000 joined back-to-back and his wife's broomstick. Wold then played it {{a little in the}} episode. Clarkson replied that it was the best use of a Morris Minor he had ever seen.|$|E
50|$|A <b>hubcap,</b> rim, {{wheel cover}} or wheel trim is a {{decorative}} disk on an automobile wheel that covers {{at least a}} central portion of the wheel, called the hub. An automobile <b>hubcap</b> is used to cover the wheel hub and the wheel fasteners to reduce the accumulation of dirt and moisture. It also has the function of decorating the car.|$|R
50|$|On June 14, {{investigators}} {{reviewed the}} surveillance video footage and {{observed that the}} car's sunroof {{was similar to the}} one on Christensen's car. They also noted that the car in the video had a cracked <b>hubcap</b> and, upon reinspecting Christensen's car, found that it also had a cracked <b>hubcap.</b> They concluded that the car in the footage belonged to Christensen.|$|R

25|$|The sedan {{models were}} {{available}} in L, XL (later renamed GL) and Ghia forms, and a Sport pack option– similar to the 1300 and 1600 Sport models sold elsewhere. Unlike other markets– likely due to the estate's absence– the van was offered in {{a higher level of}} trim – a GL, and a Sport pack van was also available. Unusual fitments for the range not offered elsewhere on the Australian Escort included 'dog-dish' steel <b>hubcaps,</b> and high-backed front seats.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the extraterrestrial hypothesis, a variety of possible explanations for flying saucers have been put forward. One {{of the most common}} states that most photos of saucers were hoaxes; cylindrical metal objects such as pie tins, <b>hubcaps</b> and dustbin lids were easy to obtain, and the poor focus seen in UFO images makes the true scale of the object difficult to ascertain. However, some photos and movies were deemed authentic after intensive study. An example was the saucer-like object photographed by farmer Paul Trent near Portland, Oregon in 1950, which passed all tests when studied by the Condon Committee in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|In July 1995, the facelifted {{model was}} {{launched}} in Australia, although this differed to the update applied to the North American variants. The update brought a new grille, slight updates to the rear end, new <b>hubcaps,</b> a lighter interior colour scheme with a new range of fabrics, and the discontinuation of the Ultima trim. Equipment wise, a new security system was fitted with remote central locking, engine immobiliser and alarm. The CSi gained four-wheel disc brakes, and optional anti-lock brakes. Seat belt webbing clamps for the front seats were now fitted as was a lap-sash belt in the centre rear. Climate control air-conditioning for the CS-X, an improved stereo system, {{and the addition of}} cup holders also featured.|$|E

25|$|Styling for 1939 {{featured}} a new two-piece “waterfall” grille with thin vertical bars. The hood was narrower, front door pillars were narrower and <b>hubcaps</b> were larger. Window area increased substantially with {{the rear window}} changing to a one-piece design. On the interior all major gauges were moved to {{in front of the}} driver and the gear shift was moved to a column mount. The 4-door phaeton could now be ordered with the built-in trunk appearance or as a fastback, but only three of the later were actually sold. Although prices were reduced (the price of the sedan fell to $1545) sales only rose to 6097, with Roadmaster’s share of Buick’s total sales falling to 2.9 percent.|$|E
25|$|The 1974 Rambler American was a carryover. The only {{difference}} was {{the presence of}} the rear five-mile-per-hour bumper and the rear license plate was relocated {{to the center of the}} rear panel over the gas filler. The standard wheels for the year were VAM's new 14x6-inch five-spoke design with volcano <b>hubcaps.</b> The 258 six included an evaporative canister to reduce emissions, and a slightly lower 8.3:1 compression ratio. However, during the mid-year, the compression ratio was lowered even more to 7.6:1. In both cases, the engines were still advertised as having an output of 170hp. The seat and door panel designs were revised. The parking brake pedal received a new smaller rubber pad.|$|E
25|$|The 1980 models {{gained a}} higher {{appointment}} of {{safety in the}} form of a locking gas cap, fold-down high-back individual seats with adjustable headrests, and the heater was made standard even on the most economical versions. New features included a split rear seat back, a 180km/h / 110mph speedometer, new seat patterns, a seven-blade flexible fan for the 258 six, new steering wheel designs for each trim level, and a new VAM grille design shared between the two versions. The X model included a new side decal design and blacked out <b>hubcaps.</b> The optional equipment list for the Gremlin X included a new AM FM stereo radio, electric antenna, and intermittent wipers.|$|E
