50|$|Pharmaceutical {{residues}} {{may reach}} the environment {{by a number}} of different routes. It is generally assumed (albeit hardly verified) that the production of pharmaceuticals in industrialised countries is well controlled and unharmful to the environment, due to the local legal restrictions usually required to permit production. However, a substantial fraction of the global production of pharmaceuticals takes place in low-cost production countries like India and China. Recent reports from India demonstrate that such production sites may emit very large quantities of e.g. antibiotics, yielding levels of the drugs in local surface waters higher than those found in the blood of patients under treatment.The major route for pharmaceutical residues to reach the aquatic environment is most probably by excretion from patients undergoing pharma treatment. Since many pharmaceutical substances are not metabolized in the body they may be excreted in biologically active form, usually via the urine. Furthermore, many pharmaceutical substances are not fully taken up from the intestine (following oral administration in patients) into their blood stream. The fraction not taken up into the blood stream will remain in the gut and eventually be excreted via the faeces. Hence, both urine and faeces from treated patients contain pharmaceutical residues. Between 30 and 90% of the orally administered dose is generally excreted as active substance in the urine. An additional source to environmental pollution with pharmaceuticals is improper disposal of unused or expired drug residues. In European countries take-back systems for such residues are usually in place (although not always utilized to full extent) while in e.g. the US only voluntary initiatives on a local basis exist.

40|$|Fate {{modeling}} for {{characterization of}} <b>ecotoxic</b> substances in life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA) is traditionally performed with steady-state multi-compartment models. Instantaneous mixing within compartments is an implicit {{assumption of the}} multi-compartment model.

The potentially affected fraction of species (PAF) has previously been used to derive <b>ecotoxic</b> effect factors. Time and space variant dispersion models (transient models) are used in marine ecological risk assessments for aquatic exposure from intermittent marine discharges. Transient models can implement continuous effect functions in pulse-exposure assessment. In this paper the significance of assuming constant effect factors is quantified by calculation of characterization factors for marine aquatic ecotoxicity with a transient dispersion model. Multi-substance PAF (msPAF) is used as definition of <b>ecotoxic</b> effect. Results show that for characterization factors with msPAF assuming concentration addition only, the deviation between a constant effect factor and a continuous effect function is small. This implies that pulse-effects are well handled with the traditional approach of approximating effect with constant effect factors. For msPAF defined {{with a combination of}} response and concentration addition, the deviation can be several orders of magnitude. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background. Biofuel {{production}} {{is expected to}} increase significantly over the coming decades. Given that climate change mitigation is a major rationale for biofuel promotion, greenhouse gas savings have so far been a main concern, but {{there is a need to}} consider other environmental impact categories as well; for example ecotoxicity due to pesticide use in biofuel feedstock production. Ecotoxicity is an impact category that has often been omitted from agricultural Life Cycle Assessments in the past due to high complexity and lack of consensus regarding characterisation. Aim and scope. The aim of this thesis is to evaluate the environmental performance of a selection of biofuel feedstocks in terms of pesticide use in cultivation and associated freshwater <b>ecotoxic</b> impacts. The feedstocks included are: maize (USA: two cases – with and without insecticide), rapeseed (Europe), Salix (Sweden), soybean (Brazil: GM and non-GM), sugarcane (Brazil) and wheat (Europe). Method. Pesticide use was investigated and typical field application scenarios were constructed. PestLCI 2. 0 was used as an emission inventory model to determine emissions to air and surface water and USEtox 1. 01 was used as a characterisation model to determine the potential freshwater <b>ecotoxic</b> impacts expressed in Comparative Toxic Units ecotoxicity (CTUe). Additional pesticides, soil and climate profiles were added to PestLCI and additional characterisation factors (CFs) were calculated in USEtox. Pesticide use and <b>ecotoxic</b> impact scores were allocated to biofuels and associated co-products through partitioning based on energy content (no co-products were assumed for Salix and sugarcane). Results. Sugarcane, conventional soybean and maize all require almost the same amount (18 − 19 g) of pesticide active substance (AS) for production of 1 GJ biofuel energy while rapeseed and wheat require 40 % and 80 % more respectively. Salix has by far the lowest pesticide AS application rate, both per hectare and year and per energy unit of biofuel output. Concerning freshwater <b>ecotoxic</b> impacts per hectare and year, Salix and rapeseed have the lowest scores (1 and 2 CTUe/ha/yr respectively) and sugarcane the highest: 89 CTUe/ha/yr - which is more than three times that of any other feedstock. The high score of sugarcane is associated with the use of the herbicides atrazine, 2, 4 -D and ametryn. In relation to biofuel energy output, the impact score of sugarcane is improved in relation to the other crops, due to high energy output. Production of 1 TJ biofuel energy from rapeseed causes an <b>ecotoxic</b> impact score of 31 CTUe, while production of 1 [*]TJ biofuel energy from wheat, maize (insecticide case), GM soybean and sugarcane give rise to <b>ecotoxic</b> impact scores 4, 10, 13 and 22 times larger, respectively. The European cases have lower ecotoxicity scores in general compared to the North and South American cases; probably an effect of stricter pesticide legislation in Europe. The top-three AS with highest <b>ecotoxic</b> impact scores are atrazine (sugarcane, 56. 8 CTUe/ha/yr), 2, 4 -D (sugarcane, 17. 8 CTUe/ha/yr) and chlorpyrifos (maize, 16. 1 CTUe/ha/yr) – all three of which are known to be problematic pesticides. Conclusions. There is a large variation in freshwater <b>ecotoxic</b> impacts of the assessed alternatives, both when compared to hectare and year and biofuel energy output. In addition, allocation influence the results significantly. There is no correlation between amount of pesticides used and <b>ecotoxic</b> impact caused, but location and timing are highly significant for emissions to various environmental compartments and hence <b>ecotoxic</b> impact scores. The largest challenges were encountered in relation to the dynamic character of pesticide use and in dealing with ecotoxicological effect data in calculation of new CFs. The models used are still immature and further research is needed to develop and make models fully compatible. Due to the limitations of the study, especially in relation to inventory of pesticide use, the <b>ecotoxic</b> impacts cannot be interpreted as fully representative for the crops in general. However, Salix has the lowest (most favourable) score in all environmental performance indicators and it is likely that a future biofuel from Salix would be associated with lower pesticide use and associated freshwater <b>ecotoxic</b> impacts compared to the other alternatives...|$|E

40|$|Chemical {{monitoring}} {{revealed a}} regular decrease in herbicide concentration in Lake Geneva since last decades {{that may be}} linked to an <b>ecotoxic</b> restoration of nontarget phytoplanktonic communities. The Pollution-induced community tolerance (PICT) approach was tested as a tool to monitor the <b>ecotoxic</b> restoration of Lake Geneva for herbicides from 1999 to 2011. We conducted monthly assessments in 1999 and in 2011 for the tolerance of the phytoplankton communities to two herbicides (atrazine and copper), using PICT bioassays. The taxonomical composition of the communities was determined on the same collecting dates. The herbicide concentration decrease during the 12 years significantly influenced the composition of communities. The PICT monitoring indicated that a significant tolerance decrease in the community to both herbicides accompanied the herbicide concentration decrease. PICT measurements for atrazine and copper also changed at the intra-annual level. These variations were mainly due to community composition shifts linked to seasonal phosphorus and temperature changes. PICT monitoring on a seasonal basis is required to monitor the mean tolerance of communities.

In conjunction, literature and data bank research on around 60 active substances have been performed. The average specific total consumption of disinfectants (without alcohols) was 4. 4 g/(bed x day), corresponding to a wastewater concentration of around 9 mg/l [...] In addition relevant consumption from kitchen and laundries are taken into account. While no effects were measured in the Ames-test in total wastewater samples, 71 % of them were tested to be gentoxic in the umuC-assay. Most of the umuC-effects in total wastewater samples could be explained with the consumption of Fluoroquinolone antibiotics. The effect levels for gentoxicity of the disinfectants applied is only exceeded if a massive input occurs in a short time. In contrast, <b>ecotoxic</b> effects measured in hospital wastewater can be explained with the consumption of disinfectants. A dysfunction of municipal wastewater treatment plants through disinfectants from the hospital area is not expected, as both the <b>ecotoxic</b> {{as well as the}} genotoxic effects of disinfectants were degraded in sewage treatment plants as a rule. It is recommended to objectify the evaluation criteria of disinfectants and to consider the environmental behaviour as an additional criterion for the selection of disinfectants more than is done currently.

We demonstrated, to out, knowledge for the first time, forelimb malformations caused by PCBs (malformation rate, > 70 %). The malformed forelimbs were fixed in the adduction-backward rotation position and could not move.
