40|$|The {{converter}} <b>dry</b> <b>dedusting</b> is {{more complicated}} with higher requirements in automatic control than the wet dust extraction. The key difficult point is the EC temperature control. This paper puts forth a method to effectively deal with the fluctuated-drastically temperature caused by control lagging at the EC outlet in the traditional converter <b>dry</b> <b>dedusting.</b> The EC outlet temperature can be under control of technological requirement by combining controls of proportion, empirical value, fuzziness and PID. The intelligent system is available with parameter auto tuning, which facilitates the on-site debugging greatly for operators. The result of the on-site application suggests that this method {{can be used to}} well handle some technological difficulties in the EC temperature control.    </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Basic {{oxygen furnace}} (BOF) gas <b>dry</b> <b>dedusting</b> {{technology}} is the main orientation of steelmaking industry. It has technical superiority in high efficiency energy conversion, energy saving and emission control and clean environmental protection fields, and it can decrease water consumption greatly, have high efficiency for steam and gas recovery, and reduce environmental pollution, {{and it is a}} key technology for realization of high-efficiency energy conversion in the contemporary steelmaking. The evaporating cooler is a key facility of temperature control for the BOF gas; it {{plays an important role in}} dedusting process. The CFD numerical simulation on flow characteristics of BOF gas in evaporating cooler has been accomplished. The gas velocity distribution, temperature distribution and dust distribution in the evaporating cooler are simulated by CFD. According to the result of research, a number of optimizations are applied in engineering, and have been proven by the outstanding performance in operating practice...|$|E
40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the process of}} advanced oxidation (AO) with application of ultrasounds and surface modification of the dust waste collected during <b>dry</b> <b>dedusting</b> of processed moulding sands with bentonite binder. A beneficial effect of both AO and adsorption modification of dust waste, when performed with the selected type of polyelectrolyte, on the technological and mechanical properties of moulding sands prepared with an addition of this dust has been stated. In spite of the bentonite content in moulding sand reduced by 43 % and replaced with modified dust waste, the mechanical properties, i. e. the compression and tensile strengths, examined on sand specimens have been improved by 10 % and 13 %, respectively, with no harm to other basic technological sand properties. At the same time, it was also possible to reduce by about 30 % the emission rate of the main gaseous component from the BTEX group, i. e. benzene...|$|E
40|$|Recently, in the {{literature}} about the problems cause to the environment by foundry industry, {{attention has been paid}} to the presence and harmful effect of aromatic hydrocarbons: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and isomers of xylenes (BTEX) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The growing interest in these pollutants of the environment is a result of their biological activity; some of them are characterized by mutagenic and carcinogenic action. In foundries these hydrocarbons are emitted during the contact between mould or core sands and liquid metal. This article discusses the results of the studies made on the elution rate of some harmful compounds include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Table 3 and 4) from waste mould sand with bentonite and coal dust M 1 (mixture Kormix 75) and this one with addition of dust from <b>dry</b> <b>dedusting</b> of sand M 2 preparing station (partial replacement of bentonite) and emission of BTEX gases from this moulds poured with molten cast iron. From the results given in these tables it follows that both mould sands are characterized by low values of the concentration of investigation substances and haven’t negative influence for environment during casting or management in other means. Tests were done according to the methodology developed at Faculty of Foundry Engineering University of Science and Technology in Cracow...|$|E
