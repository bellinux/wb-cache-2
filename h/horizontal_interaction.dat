Discontinuous wall-frame structures are studied to assess {{the effects of the}} discontinuities on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>interaction,</b> and on the structures' lateral stiffness. The discontinuities include stepped walls or frames, curtailed walls, and different configurations of stiffened-storey frames. In each case, a continuum solution is developed and used to describe the behaviour of the structure, and to evaluate the effects of the discontinuities. Corresponding discrete finite elements analyses are also performed to verify the accuracy of the algebraic solutions and to determine the nature and magnitude of the resulting effects. For stepped and curtailed wall-frame structures, it is found that the walls can be reduced or curtailed without modifying significantly the overall <b>horizontal</b> <b>interaction</b> and lateral stiffness.

40|$|Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a {{pervasive}} developmental disorder described by behavioral symptoms, evident {{before the age}} of three, that can be divided into three groups: abnormalities in social interaction and play (e. g. problems in making eye contact), atypical communicative skills (e. g. absence or limited use of gestures and facial expressions and delayed language development), and stereotyped and repetitive patterns of behavior (e. g. queuing up toy cars over and over again). Besides these higher-level cognitive impairments, there is a growing body of evidence that ASD also encompasses pure perceptual aberrancies such as enhanced visual detail perception and probably also altered global processing and visual grouping. Although ASD is a genetically determined, neurodevelopmental disorder, there is as yet no generally accepted neural explanation for atypical visual perception in these patients. In this PhD thesis we tried to establish the neural basis of atypical visual perception in ASD by studying integration properties of the visual system, necessary for global processing, as well as the integrity of neural interactions associated with detail perception and grouping. Using electro-encephalography (EEG) and functional MRI we have provided evidence for an aberrancy in low-level visual processing in ASD, which we related to atypical lateral inhibition through <b>horizontal</b> <b>interactions</b> in early visual areas. Interestingly, this impairment could be compensated later in time through enhanced processing in the angular gyrus, possibly reflecting increased local attention. We conjecture that the combination of disrupted early processing with compensation at higher levels may be a general feature of the physiology of perception in ASD. Although the relation between these findings and enhanced detail perception is merely implicit, malfunctioning of <b>horizontal</b> <b>interactions</b> can explain aberrant perceptual grouping in people with ASD. Interestingly, from neurochemistry and neuropathology research aberrant lateral inhibition in other brain areas besides the occipital cortex has been inferred. Altogether, we speculate that aberrant <b>horizontal</b> <b>interactions</b> reflect a more general neural abnormality in this disorder. Studying these neural interactions more thoroughly in the future could be a promising direction for research on visual perception in particular and possibly for ASD in general...|$|R

Abstract—The ability to distinguish between individual users in collaborative visualization is important for avoiding interference and facilitating cooperation. However, identification can be difficult on camera-based tabletops, where we typically cannot distinguish which tracked touch points belong to which user. Additional mechanisms are needed, such as video input, capacitance, or social and software protocols. We propose {{a model for the}} identification process on tabletop displays, and then use this model to suggest a software-based mechanism called interaction workspaces for supporting user identification. An interaction workspace is a movable and resizable region on the full visual space that belongs to a particular user, and inside which only that user is assumed to interact.

This model decomposes cross-platform usability into 12 factors. These factors were further decomposed into measurable criteria, and finally into specific metrics...|$|E

The brown shrimp (Crangon crangon) fishing industry in the Netherlands {{has been working on}} the implementation of a self-management strategy since 2007, as part of its ambition to get certified to the Marine Stewardship Council standard.

The failure of the initiatives for self-management is examined within Ostrom’s nested framework for understanding institutions for managing resource use.

This report examines these arrangements across the OECD. These policy choices are influenced by a need for governments to solve increasingly complex problems, ones for which solutions often require interaction among different levels of government. This has resulted in the need to manage a multi-faceted governance relationship: the vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>interaction</b> among levels of government and the challenge of ensuring that such interaction leads to coherent policy development and execution. Governments therefore, are promoting co-ordination in policy making as well as building capacity at all levels. In addition, networked relationships cannot be ignored.

International peer review operates as a dispute prevention mechanism substituting more classical compliance monitoring systems, and leading to the horizontal accountability of the involved actors.
