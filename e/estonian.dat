5|$|Various <b>Estonian</b> troops, {{which used}} {{men who had}} deserted from the 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st <b>Estonian),</b> Omakaitse militia, border defence and {{auxiliary}} police battalions, had no general planning. However, their aim was to defend the independence of Estonia.|$|E
5|$|Additional Waffen-SS {{units were}} added from the Ukrainians, Albanians from Kosovo, Serbians, Croatians, Turkic, Caucasians, Cossack, and Tatars. The Ukrainians and Tatars, who had {{suffered}} persecution under Stalin, were likely motivated primarily by opposition to the Soviet government rather than ideological agreement with the SS. The exiled Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Amin al-Husseini was made an SS-Gruppenführer by Himmler in May 1943. He subsequently used antisemitism and anti-Serb racism to recruit a Waffen-SS division of Bosnian Muslims, the SS-Handschar. The year-long Soviet occupation of the Baltic states {{at the beginning of}} World War II resulted in volunteers for Latvian and <b>Estonian</b> Waffen-SS units. The <b>Estonian</b> Legion had 1,280 volunteers under training by the end of 1942. Approximately 25,000 men served in the <b>Estonian</b> SS division, with thousands more conscripted into Police Front battalions and border guard units. Most of the Estonians were fighting primarily to regain their independence and as many as 15,000 of them died fighting alongside the Germans. In early 1944, Himmler even contacted Pohl to suggest releasing Muslim prisoners from concentration camps to supplement his SS troops.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the period, {{clearly defined}} tribal dialectical areas - Finns, Tavastians, Karelians, Northern <b>Estonians,</b> Southern <b>Estonians,</b> and Western <b>Estonians</b> {{including}} the islanders - had emerged, the population of each having formed its own understanding of identity.|$|R

5|$|Although the <b>Estonian</b> and Chinese oil-shale {{industries}} {{continued to}} grow after World War II, most other countries abandoned their projects due to high processing costs {{and the availability of}} cheaper petroleum.|$|E
5|$|Alviine-Johanna Kalep (26 June 1899 – 15 August 1989), {{known as}} Elvy Kalep, was an <b>Estonian</b> aviator and the country's first female pilot, {{as well as}} an artist, toy {{designer}} and a one-time children's author.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of <b>Estonian</b> {{oil shale}} {{resources}} and mining possibilities intensified {{during the early}} 20th century while Estonia {{was part of the}} Russian Empire. Industrial development was under way in Saint Petersburg (known as Petrograd in 1914–24), but regional fuel resources were in short supply. A large shale oil extraction plant for processing <b>Estonian</b> oil shale was proposed in 1910. The outbreak of World War I, coupled with a fuel supply crisis, accelerated the pace of the research.|$|E
50|$|Gauja <b>Estonians</b> {{are most}} likely native to their homelands. There are {{mentions}} of Chudes living in Adzele county from 12th century Russian sources. Later there are mentions of them living in Gauja river area. According to August Wilhelm Hupel's book Topographische Nachrichten von Lief und Ehstland there were about thousand <b>Estonians</b> in 1777. Anders Johan Sjögren claimed that there were 2,600 Gauja <b>Estonians</b> in 1849. Heikki Ojansuu counted only 116 when he made a trip to area in 1911. According to Ojansuu's theory, Gauja <b>Estonians</b> were refugees of Great Northern War from Southern Estonia, but today this theory has been largely abandoned. According to Harri Moora and Paul Ariste Gauja <b>Estonians</b> were original inhabitants of their homelands.|$|R
50|$|Today, about 1,500 <b>Estonians</b> {{reside in}} Argentina, who are mostly {{interested}} {{in the development of}} relations between Estonia and Argentina. In 2006, {{to meet the needs of}} <b>Estonians</b> living in Argentina, a consular mission was organised in Buenos Aires. During the mission, the consul of Estonia who resides in New York City held various consular services for local <b>Estonians.</b>|$|R

50|$|A poll {{conducted}} in September 2012 found that 34% of <b>Estonians</b> supported same-sex marriage and 46% supported registered partnerships. The poll found an ethnic divide: while 51% of ethnic <b>Estonians</b> supported registered partnerships, only 35% of ethnic Russians {{were of the}} same view. The 2015 Eurobarometer found that 31% of <b>Estonians</b> thought that same-sex marriage should be allowed throughout Europe, 58% were against.|$|R
50|$|The Ludza <b>Estonians</b> (in Ludza dialect of the Estonian: Lutsi maarahvas - ‘Lutsi Estonians’, in Latvian: Ludzas igauņi) were a {{group of}} ethnic <b>Estonians</b> living in near Ludza, {{south-eastern}} Latvia.|$|R
40|$|The Siberian <b>Estonians</b> are the descendents of the {{deportees}} {{from the}} 18 th- 19 th {{century and the}} voluntary emigrants from {{the last decade of}} the 19 th century and the early 20 th century. According to the 1989 census there were 17, 000 <b>Estonians</b> living in Siberia. During 1991 - 2000 the author collected the death and funeral traditions of the Siberian <b>Estonians</b> in rural regions, about 30 Siberian villages from the Omsk Oblast to Krasnoyarsk District. Compared to other family traditions the funeral customs are considerably more conservative and stable. The <b>Estonians</b> in Siberia wish to be buried with the Word of God, according to the Lutheran tradition, though the social situation has not been favourable (during the 1920 s- 1930 s Lutheran ministers were evicted from the villages, during 1936 - 1938 most of the religious literature was destroyed). The funeral ceremonies were conducted by amateurs, mostly older women. Even today the <b>Estonians</b> in Siberia attempt to observe the traditional death and funeral customs - e. g. the deceased is washed and dressed at home and sent to his or her last journey, there is no alternative to corpse burial in the Siberian villages, the traditionally lavish funeral feasts are held at home, death wake is still held and singing is still a part of the funeral tradition. Due to mixed marriages the <b>Estonians</b> in larger multi-ethnic villages are more prone to foreign traditions. The <b>Estonians</b> in Siberia have borrowed several memorial days from the Russian tradition (e. g. celebrating the passing of the 9 th and 40 th day from the departure, visit the graves of relatives on Christmas, Victory Day on May 9, and on Easter and Whitsunday). Siberian <b>Estonians</b> also bring food to the graves and the graves of the <b>Estonians</b> resemble more those of the local Russians. The funeral tradition of the <b>Estonians</b> in Siberia is considerably more archaic than that in Estonia, and the tradition of the <b>Estonians</b> from different regions has become more uniform. Changes in the tradition have occurred mostly in multi-ethnic villages and the Siberian <b>Estonians</b> still prefer Lutheran funeral ceremonies...|$|R

5|$|On 9 May 1922 {{the first}} {{international}} discussion of <b>Estonian</b> kukersite {{took place at the}} 64th meeting of the Institution of Petroleum Technologists. Systematic research into oil shale and its products began at Tartu University's Oil Shale Research Laboratory in 1925, initiated by professor Paul Kogerman. In 1937, the Geological Committee under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Institute of Natural Resources, an independent academic institution, were established. A department of mining was established at Tallinn Technical University in 1938. <b>Estonian</b> oil shale industries conducted tests of oil shale samples from Australia, Bulgaria, Germany and South Africa.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, 170 <b>Estonians</b> of Abkhazia were {{evacuated}} with three flights by the Republic of Estonia in 1992 (according to another source, around 400 <b>Estonians</b> altogether fled to Estonia during the war).|$|R

5|$|Six <b>Estonian</b> border defence regiments, the 113th Security Regiment, and {{remnants}} of the 20th Waffen SS Division retreating from the most distant part of the Narva front in the Krivasoo swamp were blocked by the advance units of the 8th <b>Estonian</b> Rifle Corps and destroyed in the battles of Porkuni and Avinurme on 20 and 21 September. Estonians of the Soviet rifle corps murdered their compatriots that had been taken prisoner at Porkuni and the wounded sheltering in the Avinurme Parish church.|$|E
5|$|Soviet air assaults {{against civilians}} in <b>Estonian</b> towns {{were a part}} of the offensive, aimed at forcing the Estonians away from {{supporting}} the German side. The Soviet Long Range Aviation branch assaulted the <b>Estonian</b> capital of Tallinn on the night of 8–9 March. Approximately 40% of the housing was destroyed in the city; 25,000 people were left homeless and 500 civilians were killed. The result of the air raid was the opposite of what the Soviets intended, as people felt disgusted by the Soviet atrocities; more men answered the German conscription call.|$|E
50|$|The 8th Rifle Corps {{surrounded}} about 1,500 <b>Estonians</b> retreating {{from the}} Tannenberg {{line in the}} Sinimäed Hills. In the ensuing battle, more than 500 surrounded <b>Estonians</b> were killed. Around 700 were captured.|$|R
25|$|The term Eesti, {{the name}} of the <b>Estonians,</b> occurs first again in Tacitus; however, it might have {{indicated}} Balts. In Northern Sagas (13th century) the term started to be used to indicate the <b>Estonians.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{delay of}} the Soviet advance allowed over 25,000 Estonians and 3,700 Swedes {{to flee to}} neutral Sweden and 6,000 Estonians to Finland. Thousands of {{refugees}} died on boats and ships sunk in the Baltic Sea. In September, 90,000 soldiers and 85,000 <b>Estonian,</b> Finnish and German refugees and Soviet prisoners of war were evacuated to Germany. The sole German cost of this evacuation was {{the loss of a}} steamboat. More German naval evacuations followed from <b>Estonian</b> ports, where up to 1,200 people were drowned in Soviet attacks.|$|E
5|$|The lengthy German defence {{prevented}} a swift Soviet breakthrough into Estonia {{and gave the}} underground National Committee of the Republic of Estonia enough time to attempt to re-establish <b>Estonian</b> independence. On 1 August 1944, the national committee pronounced itself Estonia's highest authority and on 18 September 1944, acting head of state Uluots appointed a new government led by Otto Tief. Over the radio in English, the government declared its neutrality in the war. The government issued two editions of the Riigi Teataja (State Gazette) but {{did not have time}} to distribute them. On 21 September, the national forces seized the government buildings in Toompea, Tallinn and ordered the German forces to leave. The flag of Estonia was hoisted at the tower of Pikk Hermann, to be removed by the Soviets four days later. The <b>Estonian</b> Government in Exile served to carry the continuity of the <b>Estonian</b> state forward until 1992, when it handed its credentials over to the incoming President, Lennart Meri.|$|E
5|$|The three Soviet Baltic Fronts {{launched}} their Riga Offensive Operation on 14 September, along the German 18th Army front segment {{from the town}} of Madona in Latvia to the mouth of the Väike Emajõgi river. In the <b>Estonian</b> section, from the Valga railway junction to Lake Võrtsjärv, the Soviet 3rd Baltic Front attacked the German XXVIII Army Corps. The German and <b>Estonian</b> Omakaitse units held their positions and prevented the Army Detachment Narwa from being encircled in Estonia.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{demographic}} {{distinction between}} native and [...] "Russian" [...] <b>Estonians</b> was age. In hopes of gaining more autonomy within the Soviet Union, many young <b>Estonians</b> joined CPE {{around the year}} 1956, while Yestonians were mostly of older generations.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{occupation of}} <b>Estonians,</b> like most Europeans, has been agriculture. Until {{the first half}} of the 20th century, Estonia was an agrarian society, but in modern times, <b>Estonians</b> have increasingly embraced an urban lifestyle. In 2013 the main export of the second largest town of Estonia, Tartu, is software. Nonetheless, many <b>Estonians</b> maintain a fondness for a rural lifestyle close to nature, and it is a common custom to visit a summer cottage in the countryside during vacations.|$|R
