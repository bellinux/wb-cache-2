5000|$|By today's standards, {{a treaty}} of cession is void if it arises {{out of an}} act of {{annexation}} procured by the threat or use of force. Although the 1898 annexation of the Philippines by the U.S. would have been unlawful by today's standards, {{it does not follow}} that the U.S. claims of sovereignty are unfounded. Under the doctrine of intertemporal law, [...] "a <b>juridical</b> <b>fact</b> must be appreciated in light of the law contemporary with it, and not the law in force at the time when a dispute in regard to it arises or falls to be settled." [...] Thus, the legality of any act should be determined in accordance with the law of the time the act was committed, and not by reference to law as it might have become at a later date. By the Westphalian sovereignty standards of the late 19th century, the cessation of these territories by Spain to the U.S. was valid.|$|E

Is Political Economy a human discipline, a science, a doctrine?

The author points out certain interesting distinctions to be noted between economic fact and <b>juridical</b> <b>fact,</b> scientific law and positive law, moral science and experimental science.

40|$|The person’s civil ability, having as {{constitutive}} elements {{the capacity}} to have rights and obligations and the legal competence, assigns the juridical capacity specific to the civil law. While the civil capacity to have rights and obligations represents the general and abstract aptitude of a person to have rights and obligations and it is gained at birth date and sometimes even since the conception, the legal competence is granted in considering the discernment gradually formed and it supposes the person’s aptitude to exert and accomplish civil obligations by contracting civil juridical documents. As such, the legal competence regards exclusively the person’s juridical documents and has no connection to the stricto sensu <b>juridical</b> <b>facts.</b> Depending {{on the stage of}} the discernment development, the Civil Code classifies natural persons in four classes, namely: persons missing the legal competence, persons having a restrained legal competence, persons having an anticipated legal competence and persons having full legal competence. Natural persons placed in one of the respective classes either cannot contract civil juridical documents, or can contract by themselves only certain civil juridical documents, or can contract certain juridical documents with the permission of the legal protector, and others even with the authorization of certain protecting organisms, or can contract by themselves any civil juridical documents allowed by the valid legislation at a certain time. juridical capacity, civil capacity, restrained exertion ability, full legal competence, discernment, civil juridical documents. ...|$|R

Its causes are diverse from economic factors, poor education, to superficial understanding of cultural and religious values. In addition to causing social, psychological and health problems, under age marriage brings about legal problems. For example, Syekh Puji and Ulfa’s marriage opens controversy areas between traditional, Islamic, national and international laws because each has different <b>juridical</b> perspectives. This <b>fact</b> causes at least two legal problems: first, harmony between one law and another; second, challenges for marital legislation in term of under age marriage.

40|$|Referring to the {{agreements}} which agents of European states made with African chiefs {{in the late}} nineteenth century, Frederick Lugard, said that they were "produced in cartloads. " This is probably an accurate description especially as it came straight from the horse's mouth - Lugard being one of the agents involved in their collection. Several writers have expressed the opinion that, from an international law point of view, these cartloads of "treaties" were just scraps of paper which neither imposed legal obligations nor conferred any rights. It is said that at best they were moral rights and duties which could be ignored at the whim of the European states. In this paper I examine some of these arguments in relation to {{the agreements}} which the British made with African chiefs {{in the late nineteenth}} century and endeavour to establish the legal significance of these agreements in international law and in British municipal law. As Judge Huber said in the Islands of Palmas Arbitratioll case, a <b>juridical</b> <b>fact</b> must be appreciated in the light of the law contemporary with it, and not of the law in force at the time when a dispute in regard to it arises or falls to be settled. Likewise the legal character of these agreements has to be determined in accordance with the law as interpreted during the period when they were made. Emphasis will be on the international law as interpreted by the British government...|$|E

40|$|Without {{claiming}} of exhaustivity, {{this work}} aims at verifying {{the possibility to}} consider food as a common good from a <b>juridical</b> perspective. In <b>fact,</b> it seems that so far the Italian constitutional doctrine has not covered this particular aspect – anything but irrelevant – in the studies dealing with these theories. Therefore, I will try hereafter to make some short reflections from a constitutional perspective, {{with the purpose of}} showing the quantity of difficulties that can be encountered if one considers this hypothesis, i. e. if one places the right to food not only beyond the «private», but also beyond the «public» dimension provided by the Constitution. Ultimately, after identifying some critical aspects of the doctrines of common goods, I will try to examine the possibility to guarantee all people the fundamental right to access to food by using the «public utilities made available by the local government». Otherwise, if we let the laws of the market be the ones that can guarantee food, we risk legitimizing a “juridical paradox” that the constitutional order (at least the Italian one) by no means can tolerate...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Italian law no. 86 of 5 June 2012, which {{establishes}} {{a set of}} rules on the matter of breast implants, came into effect in July 2012. The law {{is at the center of}} a widespread and animated cultural debate that in recent years has been taking place in Italy. DISCUSSION: The fundamental prohibition imposed by the law concerns the age limit. Breast implants for exclusively aesthetic purposes are allowed only if the legal age (18 years) has been reached. This prohibition does not apply in cases of severe congenital malformations certified by a physician operating within the National Health Service or by a public health care institution. The legal imposition of an age limit raises a number of perplexities: one at a bioethical level and one that is strictly <b>juridical.</b> In <b>fact,</b> it is impossible to deal with this issue unless the wider debate concerning the self-determination and autonomy of underage patients in biomedical matters is considered. It appears, then, that the issue is again exclusively related to the peculiarity of cosmetic surgery, which when aimed at correcting "only" the pathologic experiences of self-image, does not acquire the dignity of therapy. If, however, the improvement of self-image serves to achieve a better psycho-emotional balance and favors the development of social relations undermined by evident physical defects, age restrictions can be disregarded. The authors believe the real risk is that the law imposed by the Italian state is based on assumptions and preformed value judgments. Furthermore, in the understanding of needs, legislation often is biased toward objective biophysical problems without attaching due importance to subjective psychological and social problems. While acknowledging the seriousness of the issue, the authors do not agree with the legislature's rigidity. However, plastic surgeons must form a plan for addressing the concerns about breast implants and evaluating whether they are appropriate for adolescents, taking into account the unique psychological and developmental considerations of adolescent cosmetic surgery patients...|$|R
40|$|Children are {{the youth}} {{generation}} heir {{as the next}} generation of sate wishes. Children as the creature created by One Mighty God have basic rights since they were born, thus there is no one or other part that is permitted to take this rights. One of the shapes of Children Basic Rights was the guarantee for gaining protection of which is appropriate to the values of Pancasila and the state purpose as has been stipulated in the Preface of Constitution of 1945. Children are actually children, instead of smaller adults. Started from this characteristic, the treatment to the children involved in a crime or who have social problem, should be addressed in order and due of their prosperity. Relating to the great deal of legal problem resulted by the happening of criminal action which is conducted by the children, thus it becomes very interesting if the legal problem concerning to the happening of criminal action of stealing is submitted and studied by title “The Judge’s Judgment in Sentencing Criminal Punishment to the Perpetrator of Stealing Criminal Action of which is conducted by Children. ” Based on aforementioned above problem background, thus it can be formulated an issue, i. e. what is the judge’s basic of consideration in sentencing criminal punishment to the perpetrator of stealing criminal action of which is conducted by children. The purpose of this research was to gain data on the judge’s basic of consideration in sentencing criminal punishment to the perpetrator of stealing criminal action of which is conducted by children. By considering the problem formulation in this research, thus it can be answered, i. e. those which are able to be the consideration of the judge in sentencing the case of children who conduct stealing criminal action is the juridical and non-juridical consideration. The <b>juridical</b> <b>fact</b> which is revealed in the court session, whereas the juridical consideration is based on the existing condition in the self of the accused after or before the accused conducted a criminal action.

40|$|Two {{divergent}} {{systems are}} usually differentiated between {{when it comes}} to the way in which real rights are transferred from one person to another, namely abstract and causal systems. In this article the features of each system, the respect in which they differ from each other, and the practical implications of the distinction are established. It appears that in a causal system real rights are transferred by conclusion of the obligatory agreement, which should be valid and enforceable. The mutual intention to transfer and to receive real rights is not construed as an independent real agreement as it is contained in the obligatory agreement. In a causal system the transferor finds himself in a favourable position in relation to other parties while bona fide third parties undoubtedly get the worst of the deal since they have no protection against the disadvantageous consequences of delivery owing to a void obligation. In an abstract system the obligatory agreement is not sufficient for the transfer of real rights, the thing should also be delivered and there should be a valid real agreement which consists merely of the mutual intention to transfer and to receive real rights. The real agreement is a characteristic of an abstract system which distinguishes it from a causal system. Compared with the position of those in the causal system, the transferee and third parties find themselves in a favourable position vis-à-vis the transferor. In a causal system the concept iusta causa refers to a valid and enforceable obligatory agreement or other <b>juridical</b> <b>fact</b> which obliges the transferee to deliver the thing. In an abstract system it serves no purpose to describe the causa with reference to the obligatory agreement, since it is not a substantive law requirement for the transfer of real rights. The causa concept refers rather to the mutual intention to transfer and to receive real rights, which is nothing less than the real agreement. Since the causa is contained in the real agreement it is no longer of any use in an abstract system and should be abandoned. The Dutch system displays the characteristics of an abstract system in that a separate act of delivery should exist and a valid real agreement is a requirement for the transfer of real rights. On the other hand it also displays characteristics of a causal system, since a valid obligatory agreement is a requirement for the transfer of real rights...|$|E
