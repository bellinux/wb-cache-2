40|$|Abstract. The fuel {{injector}} acts a double role: {{it is the}} valve of the pump supplying fuel to the combustion chamber and the device spraying a supplied dose. As the valve it may operate as a self-opening or self-closing valve, depending on the pressure produced by the fuel pump, or the valve controlled by external signals. Techniques and diagnosis methods for {{fuel injector}}s depend on a fuel injector’s control system and construction details. For practical reasons the fuel injector is a sectional valve with a separated component called atomizer. Atomizers must be cooled. It is possible to cool with fuel or with external water- or oil-cooling system. In case of liquid-cooled fuel injectors, apart from malfunctions causes known from literature, decrease of the cooling efficiency may appear, as {{the effect of the}} penetration of fuel from injector to the cooling system of injector. There are no reports concerning detectability of fuel leakage into cooling liquid with known techniques and diagnosis methods of injection systems and fuel injectors. In the article there will be presented as follows: a connection of the atomizer and injector body as the place of fuel leakage into the cooling system, reasons for loss <b>of</b> <b>leak</b> <b>tightness</b> in connection <b>of</b> atomizer with the body of atomizer and methods applicable for the <b>leak</b> <b>tightness</b> analysis, mechanisms <b>of</b> injector’s malfunction caused by the loss <b>of</b> <b>leak</b> <b>tightness.</b> The analysis <b>of</b> applied and possible methods of injectors diagnosis in the aspect of identification of said leakiness will be carried out...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is to study the thermal exchanges in order to optimize the solar contributions in a habitable enclosure located in a desert region of Algeria (ADRAR). The enclosure walls are the only capacitive elements of the enclosure. They are thermally coupled by conduction, convection and radiation. The external facades of the enclosure are the seat of a convective flux with the external air and radiative exchanges with the environment (ground and sky). The thermal exchanges are studied using the balance equations established at each wall of the enclosure. These equations are discretized by an implicit finite difference method. The system of algebraic equations thus obtained is solved by the Gauss algorithm using the nodal method.

40|$|There {{exists a}} {{paramount}} need for improved understanding {{the behavior of}} high-level nuclear waste containers and the impact on structural integrity in terms <b>of</b> <b>leak</b> <b>tightness</b> and mechanical stability. The current program aims to develop and verify models of crack growth in high level waste tanks under accidental overloads such as ground settlement, earthquakes and airplane crashes based on extending current fracture mechanics methods. While studies in fracture have advanced, the mechanics have not included extensive crack growth. For problems at the INEEL, Savannah River Site and Hanford there are serious limitations to current theories regarding growth of surface cracks through the thickness and the extension of through-thickness cracks. We propose to further develop and extend slip line fracture mechanics (SLFM, a ductile fracture modeling methodology) and, if need be, other ductile fracture characterizing approaches {{with the goal of}} predicting growth of surface cracks to the point o f penetration of the opposing surface. Ultimately we aim to also quantify the stress and displacement fields surrounding a growing crack front (slanted and tunneled) using generalized plane stress and fully plastic, three-dimensional finite element analyses. Finally, we will investigate the fracture processes associated with the previously observed transition of stable ductile crack growth to unstable cleavage fracture to include estimates of event probability. These objectives will build the groundwork for a reliable predictive model of fracture in the HLW storage tanks that will also be applicable to standardized spent nuclear fuel storage canisters. This predictive capability will not only reduce the potential for severe environmental damage, but will also serve to guide safe retrieval of waste.

A helium inlet is used for letting liquid helium into the PF- 1 coil conductor. A full-scale helium inlet sample for fatigue tests and the respective tooling were designed and manufactured. Fatigue tests of the full-scale helium inlet sample were conducted in accordance with ITER requirements testing parameters in order to check the fatigue strength of the structure. Before the fatigue tests thermo-cycling of the helium inlet in the temperature range of 77  to 293  K was conducted. Before and after the fatigue tests the <b>leak</b> <b>tightness</b> <b>of</b> the full-scale helium inlet sample was validated by the vacuum chamber method. A low ohm electrical joint is used to connect two NbTi «CICC» conductors of PF- 1 coil into a single electrical loop. To qualify the design and technology of manufacturing of the electrical joint, a full-scale dummy joint sample was developed for fatigue tests at 77  K. The main design feature of the full-scale dummy joint sample for fatigue tests is a symmetrical model of two dummy joint samples with simultaneous loading to compensate the bending moment. Fatigue tests of the full-scale helium inlet sample at 77  K have been successfully conducted in 2013. Fatigue tests of the full-scale dummy joint sample will be conducted in 2014.

This study examines the effects <b>of</b> various coolant <b>leak</b> conditions in 3 -cell stack and single cell. The experimental results show that an irreversible reduction in performance occurs after coolant injection into the anode side of the stack. Poisoning of carbon monoxide (CO) on the platinum (Pt) catalyst is caused by electro-oxidation reaction of EG. Water cleaning is selected because CO poisoning is desorbed to reaction with water molecules. Performance is quickly reduced when the interval between coolant injections is short. Performance reduction is indicated by the experimental results for the gas diffusion layer (GDL) and the membrane electrode assembly (MEA). It shows that performance of the MEA with the GDL exposed to coolant decreased, but it is recovered after water cleaning. In contrast, results for performance of the MEA exposed to coolant for long time could not be reversed after water cleaning.
