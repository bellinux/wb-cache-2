He hates humans for two reasons: 1) <b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> are trying to control Sakura 2) the emperor {{put him in a}} water chamber to drown him over and over again, which eventually did drive him to what is described as insanity.

500|$|On 8 December, PewDiePie's channel reached 50 million subscribers, {{becoming}} the first YouTube channel to do so. After reaching the milestone, PewDiePie tweeted [...] "will delete tomorrow 5pm gmt," [...] in reference to his channel, before later uploading a celebratory video featuring fireworks. Ultimately, he did not delete his PewDiePie channel, and instead shut down the joke Jack septiceye2 channel, stating [...] "You know {{when you make a}} joke and it just blows up way bigger than you'd imagined?" [...] PewDiePie's stunt received negative reception from Fortune. The publication's Mathew Ingram opined, [...] "this is just a temper tantrum by a man-baby who makes millions of dollars playing video games," [...] adding, [...] "at first glance, the video in which he threatens to delete his channel seems like the whining of a rich, entitled celebrity who has noticed that his videos aren’t getting as many views as they used to, and blames the platform for not supporting him as much as <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> should." [...] On 18 December 2016, he received a Ruby Play Button from YouTube as a reward for hitting 50 million subscribers.|$|E

500|$|The {{development}} team {{put effort}} into trying to make Edgeworth look right; Eshiro described Edgeworth's running animation as [...] "graceful, while exerting effort", while Iwamoto was not entirely convinced and thought {{it looked like he}} is [...] "walking really fast accidentally". Eshiro and Yamazaki wanted to add a lot of features to the Little Thief system, but due to time constraints it ended up more simplistic than they had originally envisioned. Eshiro used his experience with producing action games such as Shadow of Rome and laying out scenes to get backgrounds to move smoothly without scrolling issues when Edgeworth moves. The programmers faced big technical challenges and had to make significant modifications to the game when implementing the graphics: in the game, two animated characters - whose graphics each are larger than those in previous Ace Attorney games - appear simultaneously and on top of smaller [...] "mini-avatar" [...] graphics. Eshiro said that <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> pushed the graphic processing ability of the Nintendo DS system to its limits for this. Eshiro said that they would consider making DSiWare episodes if demand was high enough, but {{that they did not have}} any plans at the time. He said that there were many technical aspects to consider, such as memory limitations for DSiWare.|$|E

2500|$|The actresses {{who played}} the ghosts of the murdered Grady daughters, Lisa and Louise Burns, are {{identical}} twins; however, {{the characters in the}} book and film script are merely sisters, not twins. In the film's dialogue, Mr. Ullman says <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> were [...] "about eight and ten". Nonetheless, they are frequently referred to in discussions about the film as [...] "the Grady twins".|$|E

6000|$|However, he {{was given}} a stool at the fireside, and Heinrich plied him with a {{multitude}} of questions: Where did he come from? whom had he last served? how did he like Aladdin? and did <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> should get on well? To all these queries the Genie returned evasive answers; he was Delphic to the verge of unintelligibility. He would only nod mysteriously, muttering beneath his breath in some unknown tongue, probably Arabic--in which, however, his master thought he could distinguish the words [...] "roast" [...] and [...] "boiled" [...] with significant frequency. This Genie must have served last in the capacity of cook.|$|R
2500|$|Swami Vivekananda {{felt that}} the {{education}} that young boys and girls receive is very negative. <b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> do not gain confidence or self-respect from these education, so according to Swami Vivekananda only positive education {{should be given to}} children.

2500|$|....a {{practical}} man, {{rough and}} ready in his manners and quick to decry any appearance of affection in others... Though capable of great exertion in an emergency, he normally feels no impulse {{to work hard}} without good cause. He swears hard and consistently, gambles heavily and often, and drinks deeply on occasion... he is a greater knocker of eminent people unless, as is {{in the case of}} his sporting heroes, they are distinguished by physical prowess. He is fiercely independent... above all he will stick to his mates though thick and thin, even if <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> may be wrong... He tends to be a rolling stone, highly suspect if he should chance to gather much moss.|$|E
2500|$|Ever {{since that}} time, people run around {{saying they are}} looking for their other half because they are really trying to recover their primal nature. The women who were {{separated}} from women run after their own kind, thus creating lesbians. The men split from other men also run after their own kind and love being embraced by other men (191e). Those that come from original androgynous beings are the men and women that engage in heterosexual love. He says some people think homosexuals are shameless, but <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> are the bravest, most manly of all, as evidenced by the fact that only they grow up to be politicians (192a), and that many heterosexuals are adulterous and unfaithful (191e). Aristophanes then claims that when two people who were separated from each other find each other, they never again want to be separated (192c). This feeling is like a riddle, and cannot be explained. [...] Aristophanes ends on a cautionary note. [...] He says that men should fear the gods, and not neglect to worship them, lest they wield the axe again and we have to go about hopping on one leg, split apart again(193a). If man works with the god of Love, they will escape this fate and instead find wholeness.|$|E

2500|$|Richie {{was interviewed}} in Soaplife {{and said that}} he thought it was {{important}} that no characters knew about the affair before Alfie did, because [...] "if Kat had confided in anyone that would mug Alfie off. He honestly never expected her to cheat again after everything they've been through." [...] Asked if Alfie brought it on himself by not paying Kat enough attention, Richie said that he did not, and finding out leaves him shocked, heartbroken and anrgy, as <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> are making their marriage work. He said that Alfie is a one-woman man and if Alfie had cheated on Kat, [...] "it {{would be the end of}} his world [...] He does genuinely believe in marriage." [...] Asked if Alfie could forgive Kat, Richie said that although Alfie has always done so in the past, [...] "it's different [...] so we'll have to wait and see." [...] He stated that Kat's affair might be because she loves adventure and Alfie is more [...] "set in his ways". He said that what happens next is [...] "great", the storyline leading up to Christmas 2012 was [...] "full on" [...] and that the scripts were [...] "getting the old acting juices going".|$|E

60|$|Oh! but say {{the advocates}} of this {{second-hand}} schemist, our project is to be laid before the parliament. Does that make his better, or mine worse? Have not many silly projects been laid before parliaments ere now? Admit it be not the same (as I have but too much reason to fear it is,) cannot the members of both houses read print as well as written hand? Or does <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> are so prejudiced to dislike a thing the worse for being offered without view of gain? I trust Andrew Moreton's scheme, generously offered for the public good, will meet with as fair a reception as that of this hireling projector.|$|R

60|$|George was {{conscious}} of slight amusement. The affair had its humorous side, and, though {{he was ready to}} interfere if the women were roughly handled, <b>he</b> did not <b>think</b> <b>they</b> ran any serious risk. Beamish looked capable of dealing with the situation.|$|R

He delivered this lecture on October 2, 2009, and his references are to Congressional bills that were under consideration on that date. He laid out the universal coverage debate that’s gone {{on for a long}} time in the United States; described a new solution that <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> found for Massachusetts; described how the Massachusetts reform works; and how it can be extended nationally.
