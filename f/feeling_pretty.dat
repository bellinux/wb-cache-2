So even though the relationship {{was a bit of a}} disaster, I feel that in some way I did get something out of it, which was about half the songs on this record,” Kiedis said.|$|E

[...] During an interview with People, she explained that she intended for the track to reach [...] "every young girl out there who’s gonna go through everything I went through, and more" [...] as well as older women. Connecting the lyrics with her own childhood, Fantasia said, [...] "I was very insecure growing up, and even though I'm not that girl anymore, I think that the passion, that not <b>feeling</b> <b>pretty</b> and being insecure is where my soul came from. And from early childhood, I let it free onstage." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Rapes of Graff" [...] was {{critically}} acclaimed. Price Peterson of TV.com gave {{a positive}} review. Although he expressed confusion over {{the lack of}} closure, he praised {{other aspects of the}} episode. [...] "My pervasive need for justice left me <b>feeling</b> <b>pretty</b> disappointed when we never found out who the utterly repulsive villain had been behind these sex crimes... Other than the lack of closure, though, this was a solid, well-written episode and it was nice seeing the (supposed) redemption of Troy. Television reviewer Alan Sepinwall was very positive towards the episode, praising it as a return to form for the series. [...] "Now that's more like it, Veronica Mars. A good self-contained mystery, a suggestion that the show could do okay once Veronica leaves high school, a gratuitously awesome [...] "Arrested Development" [...] double-cameo, the biggest spotlight yet for wisecracking Cliff, and a fine showcase for Jason Dohring, who's becoming so good that Veronica may need to investigate a case of show-stealing." [...] He went on to laud the supporting characters' performances, especially the subplot involving Cliff and Sheriff Lamb: [...] "Cliff and Lamb are my favorite non-Keith adult characters, so any subplot that has one busting on the other gets the Sepinwall seal of approval." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the book}} The Meanings of [...] "Beauty and the Beast": A Handbook, author Jerry Griswold {{observed}} that the [...] "Something There" [...] musical sequence is preceded by [...] "the once feisty Belle ... bandaging and nursing [...] " [...] after he rescues her from the wolves. Contextually, {{the purpose of the}} song has been identified as [...] "Dramatizing [...] partnership." [...] Leading up to the musical sequence, the Beast first [...] "surprises Belle by showing her his library and then they learn to eat together." [...] Author Robin O. Winter observed that [...] "During the scene they begin to see beneath their outer appearances and start to appreciate each other's inner qualities," [...] while one critic identified this as one of the scenes in [...] "which Belle and the Beast hesitantly slowly open up to one another." [...] Writing for Wesleyan University, Rachel Anne Silverman observed that [...] "Something There" [...] depicts [...] "The first time Belle and the Beast's attraction is introduced," [...] describing the couple's relationship as [...] "a passion that has developed over time." [...] Initially, Belle is alarmed [...] "as she realizes her growing love for the Beast," [...] briefly hiding behind a tree as she sings. According to the Hal Leonard Corporation and Music Theatre International, the castle's staff of enchanted objects also discover [...] "something different between Belle and the Beast." [...] "Something There" [...] concludes with Belle and the Beast retreating to a fireplace and reading. In the original film, [...] "Something There" [...] immediately precedes the film's title song. However, for its special edition re-release, the song is immediately followed by the newly reinstated [...] "Human Again".Identifying the song as [...] "where the genius of music as storytelling kicks in," [...] Simon Brew of Den of Geek felt that [...] "Something There" [...] is [...] "the track with the heaviest workload." [...] The author observed that [...] "In two minutes and 19 seconds, [...] gets across just how the position and feelings of the characters have changed." [...] For instance, [...] "At the beginning of 'Something There,' Belle admits that she thought the Beast was mean, coarse, and unrefined. By the end, she’s <b>feeling</b> <b>pretty</b> smitten," [...] according to Oh My Disney. The song also depicts the film's passing of time, while providing audiences with an opportunity [...] "to appreciate Beast and first see the potential for Belle and him." [...] On the song's role in the special edition version of the film, co-director Kirk Wise explained, [...] "There's a ... little suite of music now that starts with 'Something There' ... which segues into 'Human Again' which gives the object perspective on what they hope for when [...] fall in love and that transitions into 'Beauty and the Beast' the ballad, which is the culmination of their relationship." [...] Dubbing the song [...] "soliloquies of Belle and the Beast," [...] TV Guide drew comparisons between [...] "Something There" [...] and songs from the musical South Pacific.|$|E
2500|$|... "Not Fair" [...] was {{released}} digitally on 20 March 2009 {{and as a}} CD single on 16 May. [...] "Not Fair" [...] was played by DJ Ken Bruce on BBC Radio 2 days before {{the release of the}} album, and was heavily edited to 2:04, removing the line [...] "Oh I lie here in the wet patch {{in the middle of the}} bed, I'm <b>feeling</b> <b>pretty</b> damn hard done by, I've spent ages giving head". The single reached number five on the UK Singles Chart.|$|E
2500|$|Adele {{revealed}} {{that she was}} struggling emotionally when she composed it: [...] "When I was writing it I was <b>feeling</b> <b>pretty</b> miserable and pretty lonely, which I guess kind of contradicts 'Rolling in the Deep'. Whereas that was about me saying, 'I'm {{going to be fine}} without you', this is me on my knees really." [...] She discussed further the inspiration of the song: [...] "I can imagine being about 40 and looking for him again, only to turn up and find that he's settled with a beautiful wife and beautiful kids and he's completely happy... and I'm still on my own. The song's about that and I'm scared at the thought of that." ...|$|E
60|$|Although Saunders {{was really}} {{in a state of}} the utmost consternation at this {{unexpected}} termination to the whale-hunt, and expressed the agitation of his <b>feelings</b> <b>pretty</b> freely, he was too thorough a seaman to neglect anything that was necessary to be done under the circumstances. He took the exact bearings of {{the point at which the}} boats had disappeared, and during the night, which turned out gusty and threatening, kept making short tacks, while lanterns were hung at the mast-heads, and a huge torch, or rather a small bonfire, of tarred materials was slung at the end of a spar, and thrust out over the stern of the ship. But for many hours there was no sign of the boats, and the crew of the Dolphin began to entertain the most gloomy forebodings regarding them.|$|R

2500|$|Before {{recording}} {{their third}} major studio album, {{the members of}} Sanctus Real faced several personal struggles including family deaths. In early February 2005, drummer Mark Graalman {{and his wife had}} a child, and on the same day, Graalman received news of his father's failing health due to cancer. Within two months his father and lead vocalist Matt Hammit's grandmother died, and the band's bassist left the group. Hammit said in an interview, [...] "It basically left [...] <b>feeling</b> <b>pretty</b> confused about what was next for Sanctus Real, what kind of record we were going to make and how it was even going to happen." [...] The album's final track, [...] "Benjamin", was written to Graalman's infant son in relation to the father's death.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, I {{can tell}} you this--if she had stolen the money she would neither have started nor stared. She would have had her answer ready {{beforehand}} in her own mind, in case of accidents. There's only one thing in my experience that you can never do with a thief, when a thief {{happens to be a}} woman--you can never take her by surprise. Put that remark by in your mind; one day you may find a use for remembering it. Did you see her blush, and look quite hurt in her <b>feelings,</b> <b>pretty</b> dear, when I asked about her sweetheart? Do you think a thief, in her place, would have shown such a face as that? Not she! The thief would have been relieved. The thief would have said to herself, 'All right! the more the old fool talks about sweethearts the further he is from tracing the robbery to Me!' Yes! yes! the ground's cleared now, Master Moody. I've reckoned up the servants; I've questioned Miss Isabel; I've made my inquiries in all the other quarters that may be useful to us--and what's the result? The advice I gave, when you and the lawyer first came to me--I hate that fellow!--remains as sound and good advice as ever. I have got the thief in my mind," [...] said Old Sharon, closing his cunning eyes and then opening them again, [...] "as plain as I've got you in my eye at this minute. No more of that now," [...] he went on, looking round sharply at the path that led to the farmhouse. [...] "I've something particular to say to you--and there's barely time to say it before that nice girl comes back. Look here! Do you happen to be acquainted with Mr.-Honorable-Hardyman's valet?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, he is a {{good bit}} hurt, sir. That big chap looks as strong as a bullock, and his blow has {{flattened}} the foreign chap's nose. He cannot see out of his eyes this morning, and is keeping his bunk. They cannot stand a blow, those foreign chaps; but I don't suppose that any of us would have stood such a blow as that, without <b>feeling</b> it <b>pretty</b> heavy. The man who hit him is quite sorry this morning that he hit him quite so hot, but, as he says, when a fellow draws a knife on you, you have not got much time for thinking it over, and you have got to hit quick and hard. I told him he needn't be sorry about it. I consider when a fellow draws a knife that hanging aint too bad for him, whether he gets it into a man or not." ...|$|R

6000|$|I am, {{none the}} less, ever so thankful that neither my ears, nose, nor eyes, {{positively}} magnify, so to speak. I {{may be a}} little more sensitive to noises and smells than some people are, but that again is probably only because I was brought up so fresh and quiet and privately. I am far more backward than can be excused, and in some things abominably slow-witted. Whether or not my <b>feelings</b> are <b>pretty</b> much of the usual size, I cannot say. What is more to the point is that in some of my happiest moments my inward self seems to be as remote from my body as the Moon is from Greenland; and, at others,--even though that body weighs me down to the earth like a stone--it is as if memory and consciousness stretched away into the ages, far, far beyond my green and dwindling Barrow on Chizzel Hill, and had shaken to the solitary night-cry of Creation, [...] "Let there be Light." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. Getting their wind, and <b>feeling</b> their legs. <b>Pretty</b> runner, Fleetwood--if {{you notice}} Sir?

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Exclaim! the group said that: [...] "No Love {{a sort of a}} culmination of our two previous releases. We think it'll end up being the heaviest thing we've made so far on many levels. It's striking us as the closest we've gotten to what our initial vision of what Death Grips would sound like. We have the <b>feeling</b> and it's <b>pretty</b> absolute that this album will contain our most future-forward and potent material...It's emotionally raw and direct; the sound is indescribable, it's very beat oriented. It has some of the guitar-driven elements that we touched on with Exmilitary but they aren't exactly being generated by a guitar." ...|$|R

5000|$|One {{aspect of}} his {{approach}} to variation writing is made explicit {{in a number of}} letters. [...] "In a theme for a of variations, it is almost only the bass that has any meaning for me. But this is sacred to me, it is the firm foundation on which I then build my stories. What I do with a melody is only playing around ... If I vary only the melody, then I cannot easily be more than clever or graceful, or, indeed, if full of <b>feeling,</b> deepen a <b>pretty</b> thought. On the given bass, I invent something actually new, I discover new melodies in it, I create." [...] The role of the bass is critical.|$|R
60|$|As for John Creedy, he was {{naturally}} charmed with Ethel. In {{the first}} place, {{he would have}} been charmed with any English girl who took so much interest in himself and his plans, for, like all negroes, he was frankly egotistical, and delighted to find a white lady who seemed to treat him as a superior being. But in the second place, Ethel was really a charming, simple English village lassie, with sweet little manners and a delicious blush, who might have impressed a far less susceptible man than the young negro parson. So, whatever Ethel felt, John Creedy felt himself truly in love. And after all, John Creedy was in all essentials an educated English gentleman, with the same chivalrous <b>feelings</b> towards a <b>pretty</b> and attractive girl that every English gentleman ought to have.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hugh's saying {{something}} pretty to Louie, I'm sure," [...] Harry {{thought to himself}} with a smile of pleasure, as he looked across at the sweet little graceful girlish figure.

Dear child, how she lets one read in her eyes and cheeks her every tiny passing <b>feeling!</b> Her <b>pretty</b> wee mouth is like an open book! Hugh's telling her confidentially now that she's the belle of the evening. And so she is; there's not a doubt about it. Not a girl in the place fit to hold a candle to my Louie; especially when she blushes--she's sweet when she blushes. Now she's colouring up again. By Jove, yes, he must be positively making love to her. There's nothing I enjoy so much as seeing Louie enjoying herself, and being made much of. Too many girls, bright young girls, when they marry early, as Louie has done, settle down at once into household drudges, and never seem to get any happiness worth mentioning out of their lives in any way. I won't let it be so with Louie. Dear little soul, she shall flit about as much as she likes, and enjoy herself as the fancy seizes her, like a little butterfly, just like a butterfly. I love to see it!" [...] And he hugged one clasped hand upon the other silently.|$|R

2500|$|The album Music from Big Pink, in particular, is {{credited}} with contributing to Clapton's decision to leave the supergroup Cream. In his introduction of The Band during the Bob Dylan 30th Anniversary Concert, Clapton announced that in 1968 {{he had heard the}} album, [...] "and it changed my life." [...] Nazareth took their name from [...] "The Weight" [...] - taken from the line [...] "I pulled into Nazareth, feeling half past dead" [...] Guitarist Richard Thompson has acknowledged the album's influence on Fairport Convention's Liege and Lief, and journalist John Harris has suggested that The Band's debut also influenced the spirit of The Beatles' back-to-basics album Let It Be as well as the Rolling Stones' string of roots-infused albums that began with Beggars Banquet. George Harrison said that his song [...] "All Things Must Pass" [...] was heavily influenced by the Band and that, while writing the song, he imagined Levon Helm singing it. Meanwhile, the Big Pink song [...] "The Weight" [...] has been covered numerous times, and in various musical styles. In a 1969 interview, Robbie Robertson remarked on the group's influence, [...] "We certainly didn't want everybody {{to go out and get}} a banjo and a fiddle player. We were trying to calm things down a bit though. What we're going to do now is go to Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and record four sides, four psychedelic songs. Total freak-me songs. Just to show that we have no hard <b>feelings.</b> Just <b>pretty</b> good rock and roll." ...|$|R
60|$|When {{the evening}} {{for the small}} party came, she found that the poplin wouldn't do at all, for the other girls were putting on thin dresses and making {{themselves}} very fine indeed. So out came the tarlatan, looking older, limper, and shabbier than ever beside Sallie's crisp new one. Meg saw the girls glance at it and then at one another, and her cheeks began to burn, for with all her gentleness she was very proud. No one {{said a word about}} it, but Sallie offered to dress her hair, and Annie to tie her sash, and Belle, the engaged sister, praised her white arms. But in their kindness Meg saw only pity for her poverty, and her heart felt very heavy as she stood by herself, while the others laughed, chattered, and flew about like gauzy butterflies. The hard, bitter <b>feeling</b> was getting <b>pretty</b> bad, when the maid brought in a box of flowers. Before she could speak, Annie had the cover off, and all were exclaiming at the lovely roses, heath, and fern within.|$|R
