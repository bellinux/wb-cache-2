40|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} of soils and rocks constitutes an important property {{for the design}} of geothermal energy foundations and borehole heat exchange systems. Therefore, it is interesting to find new alternatives to define this parameter involved in the calculation of very low enthalpy geothermal installations. This work presents the development of an experimental set-up for measurements of {{thermal conductivity}} of soils and rocks. The device was designed based on the principle of the Guarded Hot Plate method using as heat source a laboratory heater. The thermal conductivity of thirteen rocky and soil samples was experimentally measured. Results are finally compared with the most common thermal conductivity values for each material. In summary, the aim of the present research is suggesting a procedure to determine the thermal conductivity parameter by a simple and economic way. Thus, increases of the final price of these systems that techniques such as the “Thermal Response Test” (TRT) <b>involvs,</b> could be avoided.

40|$|Abstract—Introduced in 2005, the Voronoi treemap {{algorithm}} is an information visualization technique for displaying hierarchical data. Voronoi treemaps use weighted, centroidal Voronoi diagrams {{to create a}} nested tessellation of convex polygons. However, despite appealing qualities, few real world examples of Voronoi treemaps exist. In this paper, we present a multi-touch tabletop application called <b>Involv</b> that uses the Voronoi treemap algorithm to create an interactive visualization for the Encyclopedia of Life. <b>Involv</b> {{is the result of}} a yearlong iterative development process and includes over 1. 2 million named species organized in a nine-level hierarchy. Working in the domain of life sciences, we have encountered the need to display supplemental hierarchical data to augment information in the treemap. Thus we propose an extension of the Voronoi treemap algorithm that employs force-directed graph drawing techniques both to guide the construction of the treemap and to overlay a supplemental hierarchy.

40|$|The loss {{of teeth}} and {{damage to the}} jaw bone occur under {{different}} circumstances. The deficit {{may be the result}} of wearing inadequate dentures, residual ridge resorption, osteoporosis, periodontal disease, trauma, tumors, radiation, etc. The deficit of bone tissue can be a substantial problem because it prevents adequate prosthetic patient care and restoration of disturbed functions of stomatognathic system. With such patients, there is often a need for preprosthetic surgical procedure through the application of various techniques and materials in order to resolve aftermentioned bone shortcomings. The most appropriate biological materials for the reconstruction are autogenous bone graft and artificial bone. With the development of technology and specific biomaterials it is tried to avoid situations that require autogenous bone grafting, since it <b>involvs</b> long surgical procedure with the possibility of postoperative complications. The application of synthetic biomaterials, whose properties are similar to natural hydroxyapatite, promotes the biological potential for bone tissue repair. Synthetic biomaterials have great biocompatibility and sterility and do not act antigenicaly. The disadvantages of this material are overcome by the addition of organic polymers. Thanks to the stability and flexibility of hydroxyapatite structure, a large number of ionic changes are possible, both cationic and anionic, which improve the characteristics of synthetic hydroxyapatite. Biomaterials that include different drugs, such as antibiotics, vitamins and other preparations, could be used for the treatment of complications after surgical procedures and infection of bone tissue. Our experimental studies indicate that biomaterials based on hydroxyapatite are valuable materials that can be used for preprosthetic surgical preparation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a research study where constructivism {{was used as}} the rationale for the design, implementation and evaluation of four technology-based investigations for Year 12 Applicable Mathematics students. Analysis is given of the successes and difficulties encountered by students and teachers of four classes, including my own, in which the investigations were implemented. The results showed that, for learning activities <b>involVing</b> school assessment, many students chose not to work collaboratively- a strategy suggested by social constructivism. The extent to which this may have been detrimental to their learning is discussed. The study illustrates how engaging in research can be a means for teachers to understand theory. In particular, the paper describes the meaning made of constructivism through this example of teaching practice and research activity. There is perceived to be a gap between practice and research in mathematics education. The gap was very real to me when, as a secondary school mathematics teacher undertaking postgraduate study, I was confronted with literature suggesting that didactic methods (which were predominant in my practice) are ineffective compared to constructivist approaches. This paper reports a research project through which I partly crossed the research-practice gap and reconceptualised how learning occurs. It portrays research that started as an inquiry into technology-based learning in one of my own classes, and which evolved to include constructivism as a rationale for the teaching method. I discuss the meaning I made of constructivism through the teaching and research activities. My purpose in writing the paper is to provide an example of the practical orientation described as needed for research to be relevant to practice, that is, "the idea of actually viewing the classroom as teachers view it " (Kennedy, 1997, p. 7).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to extend the {{application}} of culture into product design with particular attention to urban stre. etscape elements (known as street furniture). Poor understanding of culture and the lack of opportunity to use culture ina practical manner within the student group were explored as the problem areas. The initial motivation for the study stemmed from a desire to encourage the integration of the non-technological aspects of the design products, in which culture was categorised. This was believed to mainly achieve by developing a Cultural-Semiotic framework, which enables and encourages design students (novice designers) to approach culture in their projects. Therefore, a hypothesis was formulated to examine the extent of the. framework: A culturally orientated framework can be developed to determine important/significant variables to produce predictable culturally relevant changes in product design in general and urban streetscape elements in partl. cuIar. '' Culture could have strong interactions with product design in several ways, due to the symbolic qualities that a design product provides. Therefore, this enables products to be studied culturally, e. g. within a designer's mind (subjective aspects of culture) or outside his/her mind (objective aspects). To develop the framework, three fieldworks as a triangulation methodology were initially undertaken. Through Fieldwork 1 the author acquired a general idea about the current cultural understanding of novice designers. Fieldwork 2, examined the cultural extent of the design courses, and the understanding of culture amongst a wider and versatile audience. Meanwhile, Fieldwork 3 looked at how novice designers could convert cultural knowledge into practice. This established the problem areas and indicated the area of focus, which was representation. Representation is the process that gives product-signs their particular meaning. Then, a number of associated models were studied and the relevant ones were used as the basis. By implementing Schwartz Value Inventory, Four semantic functions of signs and the Saussrean model of sign, the Cultural-Semiotic framework was developed. The framework could perform on the degree of cultural meaning one might want to put into a design product. The framework was examined and evaluated through a workshop and a sample project session, <b>involVing</b> a selected group of novice designers. The Circuit of Culture model was used as an evaluation model alongside the SOLO Taxonomy, a model that describes the levels of increasing compleXity in a student's understanding of subjects. The emphasis was on the representational qualities of products. The result confirmed the role of the framework in enhancing the cultural understanding of novice designers. It specified: Ã‚Â• The degree of cultural insight of a selected group; Ã‚Â• The level of objectiVity in a totally subjective issue; Ã‚Â• A deeper understanding of culture compared to the preliminary participants; Ã‚Â• A certain degree of confirmation of the proposed hypothesis.
