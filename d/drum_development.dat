50|$|Musically, Timbalada is {{credited}} with two major innovations in the instrumentation of Afro-Brazilian music: {{the revival of the}} timbal (a tall, high-pitched hand <b>drum),</b> and the <b>development</b> of a rack of 3 surdos (bass drums) that can be played by a single player. The timbal, which had been nearly extinct before Timbalada began featuring it, has since become widespread in many Afro-Brazilian genres, including axé and samba-reggae. The rack of surdos, also called a bateria-de-surdo (surdo drumset), is now widely used by many groups for stage performances when not parading. Because the bateria-de-surdo can only hold 3 surdos within arm's reach of a single player, the traditional four-surdo arrangement of many samba-reggae rhythms is often trimmed down to three.|$|R

500|$|This is {{the case}} of Art vs. Mechanical Music in theatres. The {{defendant}} stands accused in front of the American people of attempted corruption of musical appreciation and discouragement of musical education. Theatres in many cities are offering synchronised mechanical music as a substitute for Real Music. If the theatre-going public accepts this vitiation of its entertainment program a deplorable decline in the Art of Music is inevitable. Musical authorities know that the soul of the Art is lost in mechanisation. It cannot be otherwise because the quality of music is dependent on the mood of the artist, upon the human contact, without which the essence of intellectual stimulation and emotional rapture is lost. No great volume of evidence is required to answer this question. Music is a well-nigh universally beloved art. From the beginning of history, men have turned to musical expression to lighten the burdens of life, to make them happier. Aborigines, lowest in the scale of savagery, chant their song to tribal gods and play upon pipes and shark-skin <b>drums.</b> Musical <b>development</b> has kept pace with good taste and ethics throughout the ages, and has influenced the gentler nature of man more powerfully perhaps than any other factor. Has it remained for the Great Age of Science to snub the Art by setting up in its place a pale and feeble shadow of itself? ...|$|R

Therefore, {{the purpose of}} this research was to investigate elements that contribute to effective, sustained professional {{development for}} music teachers. Specifically, this study is an examination of the efficacy of a 90 clock-hour, immersion-based professional development cluster on steel pan through the unique lens of flow theory. According to Csikszentmihalyi (1991), flow is considered to be an optimal state in which skill and perceived level of challenge match. In the present study, music teachers??? (N= 33) experiences in the steel <b>drum</b> professional <b>development</b> cluster were documented. The cluster was a 5 -day period in which music teachers were immersed in learning how to play and teach steel pan. Data sources were participants??? daily journal reflections (N= 137 entries), videotaped rehearsals (13 hours), interviews (N= 7), and results from a follow-up satisfaction survey (N= 25; 65 % return). Csikszentmihalyi???s indicators of flow were used to code the data. Prevailing indicators of flow found to exist for the participants were immediate feedback, chance for completion, and high levels of interest/motivation. Findings suggest that the immersion context fostered participants??? growth in knowledge and skill for playing and teaching steel pan. Findings also suggest that immersion-based professional development promotes flow and has many attributes of an effective professional development paradigm. Music Educatio...|$|R

A method has been developed for the routine assay of prohibited items (liquids, etc.) contained in a 30 -gallon drum that is then placed into a 55 -gallon <b>drum.</b> Method <b>development</b> consisted of system calibration with a NIST standard at various drum-to-detector distances, method verification with a liquid sample containing a known amount of Pu- 238, and modeling the inner container using Ortec Isotopic software. Using this method for measurement of the known standard in the drum-in-drum configuration produced excellent agreement (within 15 %) with the known value. Savannah River Site Solid Waste Management also requested analysis of waste contained in large black boxes (commonly 18 -feet x 12 -feet x 7 -feet) stored at the SWMF. These boxes are frequently stored in high background areas and background radiation must be considered for each analysis. A detection limit of less than 150 fissile-gram-equivalents (FGE) of TRU waste {{is required for the}} black-box analyses.

500|$|According to the Game Informer preview, the {{addition}} of drum functionality came from work initially done towards the Drum Hero title. This work was later folded into the Guitar Hero series after Neversoft was chosen as developer of the series. Neversoft's Allen Flores stated that with {{the addition}} of the existing <b>drum</b> gameplay, the <b>development</b> of World Tour took under a year, starting development immediately after the release of Guitar Hero III. The drum instrument controller was designed to be more realistic, with input from Chad Smith (of Red Hot Chili Peppers), Stewart Copeland (of The Police) and Travis Barker (of Blink-182), all of whom requested the elevated cymbal pads. The ability to open-strum the guitar was a feature that was planned for Guitar Hero III but was removed before release, finding that it was too difficult on the guitar tracks.

Family farming is the backbone of the European model of agriculture. Rdp provide family farms with a set of opportunities which, if well exploited, could <b>drum</b> up farm’s <b>development.</b> Design/methodology/approach An empirical analysis of a data base provided by the Lazion region of Italy on the adoption of rdp by family farms in the Lazio region for the period 2007 - 2013. Cluster analysis is the main analytical tool employed. Findings Our results evidence significant differences in the adoption of rural policy on the basis of family life cycle and the composition of the family farm. The empirical analysis underlines the low degree of coherence by farms located in rural areas. Practical implications Farmers’ success in accessing funds requires them to be proactive and take a strategic perspective in order to convince funders that they have a coherent strategy which meets the requirements of the particular Rdp which they are trying to access. Originality/value The paper is unique in that it considers the consumption of Policy by farmers who are entrepreneurial in their vision. By consumption of Rdp we mean the farmer's strategic capability to obtain funds from regional funding pots for rural developmen...|$|R

40|$|Paper drying is {{the most}} {{energy-intensive}} and temperature-critical aspect of papermaking. It is estimated that about 67 % of the total energy required in papermaking is used to dry paper. The conventional drying method uses a series of steam-heated metal cylinders that are required to meet ASME codes for pressure vessels, which limits the steam pressure to about 160 psig. Consequently, the shell temperature and the drying capacity are also limited. Gas Technology Institute together with Boise Paper Solutions, Groupe Laparrier and Verreault (GL&V) USA Inc., Flynn Burner Corporation and with funding support from the U. S. Department of Energy, U. S. natural gas industry, and Gas Research Institute is developing a high efficiency gas-fired paper dryer based {{on a combination of}} a ribbon burner and advanced heat transfer enhancement technique. The Gas-Fired Paper Dryer (GFPD) is a high-efficiency alternative to conventional steam-heated drying drums that typically operate at surface temperatures in the 300 ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂºF range. The new approach was evaluated in laboratory and pilot-scale testing at the Western Michigan University Paper Pilot Plant.

40|$|Thousands {{of drums}} of radioactive/hazardous/mixed waste are {{currently}} stored at DOE sites throughout US; they {{are stored in}} warehouse facilities on an interim basis, pending final disposition. Recent emphasis on anticipated decommissioning of facilities indicates that many more drums of waste will be generated, requiring additional storage. Federal and state regulations dictate that hazardous waste covered by RCRA be inspected periodically for container degradation and to verify inventories. All known DOE waste storage facilities are currently inspected manually. A system to perform robotic inspection of waste <b>drums</b> is under <b>development</b> by the SRTC Robotics Group of WSRC; {{it is called the}} Stored Waste Autonomous Mobile Inspector (SWAMI). The first version, SWAMI I, was developed by the Savannah River Technology Center (SRTC) as a proof of principle system for autonomous inspection of drums in a warehouse. SWAMI I was based on the Transitions Research Corporation (TRC) HelpMate mobile robot. TRC modified the Helpmate to navigate in aisles of drums. SRTC added subsystems to SWAMI I to determine its position in open areas, read bar code labels on the drums up to three levels high, capture images of the drums and perform a radiation survey of the floor in the aisles. The radiation survey was based on SRTC patented technology first implemented on the Semi-Intelligent Mobile Observing Navigator (SIMON). The radiation survey is not essential for the inspection of drums, but is an option that can increase the utility and effectiveness of SWAMI in warehouses with radioactive and/or mixed waste. All the sensors on SWAMI I were fixed on the vehicle. From the success of SWAMI I, a second version, SWAMI II, was developed; it will be evaluated at Fernald and tested with two other mobile robots. Intent is to transfer the technology developed for SWAMI I and II to industry so that it can supply additional units for purchase for drum inspection...|$|R

But now, the symbols used in the ad does not guarantee {{whether it is a}} picture of social reality or not. The presence of advertising as a platform game mark, making the ads have complex meanings, either meaning implicit or explicit meaning. Kompas daily advertising drum version for example, which displays many signs and make the drums as a central position in the ad. In the contextual ads that traditional culture, the communicator makes musical instruments drums as symbols to convey his message. On this basis, researchers interested in conducting research on the meanings in the Kompas daily advertising drum version on television. The study was conducted to understand the symbolic meaning drum version of the Kompas daily advertising on television. Because in this case symbolized the meaning of the ad through the drum, the researchers focused the analysis on the drum to get the meaning of the ad. Making of television ads are not just describe the plot contained in a series of ads, but it must be done using appropriate research methods, so that in can be the meaning as it has been formulated. Therefore, in this study the researcher used the research methods in particular semiotic semiotics of Roland Barthes. Because the researchers wanted to dismantle the deeper meanings of symbolic meaning, the theory of Barthes that are considered capable of developing two levels of meaning of the sign, and look deeper meaning but it is more conventional, namely the meanings associated with the myth. In Roland Barthes' semiotic method, researchers should pay attention to the signs contained in the audio or visual elements contained in the ad. Then interpreted in two pertandaan level, namely the level of denotation and connotation level. The other used a qualitative descriptive approach type to get the full picture, comprehensive, objective, and systematic. The scope of this study is the entirety of the Kompas newspaper ads in the television version of the drum which lasts 24. 47 seconds with 3 scenes and 24 shots. While the unit of analysis in this study is the overall mark, whether audio or visual element, which can reveal the symbolic meaning of a musical instrument drum contained in the Kompas newspaper ads drum version on television. The results {{of this study indicate that}} in addition to meaningful straightforward, drum also the symbolic significance of a controller, a leader, a simple musical instruments, sacred, originality, order and harmony. In the art of traditional culture of Indonesian society, the drum is one type of gamelan instruments used to accompany sacred or ceremonial dances. Musical instrument drum is very influential for other musical instruments, because the strains of the drum is a musical note or the leader of the commencement of the strains of gamelan music. In addition, the drum as a type of music determines the rhythm, intonation, and movement in music or dance. Symbolic meaning drum removed from the myth of the existence of a drum that can be "life" in the gamelan. Meaning indicated above from hearing the music of gamelan music instead of drums. Also, these things can also be seen from the manufacture of drum grooves from beginning to end which is supported by setting the simple, natural ingredients drum, and the viewing of people who are adept at playing drums. Drum in the ad Compass image is a representation that want to build Compass as one of the newspapers in Indonesia. Drum symbolic meaning in these ads point is, Kompas want to be central, and central determinant of the spread of news in the world of journalism. In addition, the existence of an opening rhythm of the drum as gamelan music represents Compass determination to become a world leader in print media journalism As a suggestion for other researchers interested in the study of ad text, in order to try to develop similar research, for example, if interested in studying the same object but with a different knife analysis, by contrast when using a knife analysis examine a different but similar object...|$|R
