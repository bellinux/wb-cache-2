5|$|The 767 entered {{service with}} United Airlines on September 8, 1982. The aircraft's first {{commercial}} flight used a JT9D-powered 767-200 on the Chicago-to-Denver route. The CF6-powered 767-200 commenced service {{three months later}} with Delta Air Lines. Upon delivery, early 767s were mainly deployed on domestic routes, including US transcontinental services. American Airlines and TWA began flying the 767-200 in late 1982, while Air Canada, China Airlines, and El Al began operating the aircraft in 1983. The aircraft's introduction was relatively smooth, with few operational glitches and greater dispatch reliability than prior jetliners. In its first year, the 767 logged a 96.1percent dispatch rate, which exceeded the industry average for new aircraft. Operators reported generally favorable ratings for the twinjet's sound levels, interior comfort, and economic performance. Resolved issues were minor and included the recalibration of a leading <b>edge</b> <b>sensor</b> to prevent false readings, the replacement of an evacuation slide latch, and the repair of a tailplane pivot to match production specifications.|$|E

50|$|SRON’s {{leading role}} in the {{development}} of SAFARI is mainly due to the infrared detectors developed by SRON scientists. Extremely sensitive detectors must be used in SAFARI to gain maximum benefit from the low infrared emissions of SPICA’s cooled mirror. In June 2010, an international evaluation committee selected, out of four different technologies, the Transition <b>Edge</b> <b>Sensor</b> (TES) detectors from SRON together with the associated readout electronics.|$|E
50|$|Although Johnson-Nyquist noise shares many {{similarities}} with phonon noise (e.g. {{the noise}} spectral density {{depends on the}} temperature and is white at low frequencies), these two noise sources are distinct. Johnson-Nyquist noise arises from the random thermal motion of electrons, whereas phonon noise arises from the random exchange of phonons. Johnson-Nyquist noise is easily modeled at thermal equilibrium, where all components of the circuit are held at the same temperature. A general equilibrium model for phonon noise is usually impossible because different components of the thermal circuit are nonuniform in temperature and also often not time invariant, as in the occasional energy deposition from particles incident on a detector. The transition <b>edge</b> <b>sensor</b> typically maintains the temperature through negative electrothermal feedback associated with changes in internal electrical power.|$|E
5000|$|Phonon noise, {{also known}} as thermal {{fluctuation}} noise, arises from the random exchange of energy between a thermal mass and its surrounding environment. This energy is quantized {{in the form of}} phonons. Each phonon has an energy of order , where [...] is Boltzmann's constant and [...] is the temperature. The random exchange of energy leads to fluctuations in temperature. This occurs even when the thermal mass and the environment are in thermal equilibrium, i.e. at the same time-average temperature. If a device has a temperature-dependent electrical resistance, then these fluctuations in temperature lead to fluctuations in resistance. Examples of devices where phonon noise is important include bolometers and calorimeters. The superconducting transition <b>edge</b> <b>sensor</b> (TES), which can be operated either as a bolometer or a calorimeter, {{is an example of a}} device for which phonon noise can significantly contribute to the total noise.|$|E

50|$|In January 2017, ESO {{awarded the}} {{contract}} for the fabrication of the 4608 <b>edge</b> <b>sensors</b> to the FAMES consortium, which is composed of Fogale and Micro-Epsilon. These sensors can measure relative positions to an accuracy of a few nanometres, the most accurate ever used in a telescope.|$|R
5000|$|Active guiding {{systems are}} {{composed}} of a sensor, an actuator connected to a guide mechanism, and a controller. The sensor can be any detector, which can reliably pick up the edges of a web. The most common types of sensors are pneumatic (only works with nonporous webs), optical (works well with opaque webs), ultrasonic (works with most material), or paddies (thick webs). Recent developments have introduced to the industry a new sensor technology based on light scattering and spatial filtering that allows {{the use of an}} optical sensor to detect the edge of any material. [...] The web must be flat (free of curl) and stable (free of flutter) through the <b>edge</b> <b>sensor.</b> For this and other reasons, the sensor is often placed near a roller. If two sensors are used, the web could be guided to the front edge, back edge, or center. Common active guide systems include steering guide (remotely pivoted guide), displacement guide (offset-pivot guide), unwind guide, and rewind guide.|$|E

50|$|The {{telescope}} {{looks out}} of a large door in the port side of the fuselage near the airplane's tail, and initially carried nine instruments for infrared astronomy at wavelengths from 1-655 micrometres (μm) and high-speed optical astronomy at wavelengths from 0.3-1.1 μm. The main instruments are the FLITECAM, a near infrared camera covering 1-5 μm; FORCAST, covering the mid-infrared range of 5-40 μm, and HAWC, which spans the far infrared in the range 42-210 μm. The other four instruments include an optical photometer and infrared spectrometers with various spectral ranges. SOFIA’s telescope {{is by far the}} largest ever to be placed in an aircraft. For each mission one interchangeable science instrument will be attached to the telescope. Two groups of general purpose instruments are available. In addition an investigator can also design and build a special purpose instrument. On April 17, 2012, two upgrades to HAWC were selected by NASA to increase the field of view with new transition <b>edge</b> <b>sensor</b> bolometer detector arrays and to add the capability of measuring the polarization of dust emission from celestial sources.|$|E

50|$|While the SNSPD {{does not}} offer the {{intrinsic}} energy or photon-number resolution of the superconducting transition <b>edge</b> <b>sensor,</b> the SNSPD is significantly faster than conventional transition edge sensors and operates at higher temperatures. Most SNSPDs are made of niobium nitride (NbN), which offers a relatively high superconducting critical temperature (≈ 10 K) and a very fast cooling time (<100 picoseconds). NbN devices have demonstrated device detection efficiencies as high as 67% at 1064 nm wavelength with count rates {{in the hundreds of}} MHz. NbN devices have also demonstrated jitter - the uncertainty in the photon arrival time - of less than 50 picoseconds, as well as very low rates of dark counts, i.e. the occurrence of voltage pulses {{in the absence of a}} detected photon. In addition, the deadtime (time interval following a detection event during which the detector is not sensitive) is on the order of a few nanoseconds, this short deadtime translates into very high saturation count rates and enables antibunching measurements with a single detector.|$|E
