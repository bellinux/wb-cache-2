50|$|Digital {{and film}} cameras share an optical system, {{typically}} using a lens with a variable diaphragm to focus light onto an <b>image</b> <b>pickup</b> device. The diaphragm and shutter admit {{the correct amount}} of light to the imager, just as with film but the <b>image</b> <b>pickup</b> device is electronic rather than chemical. However, unlike film cameras, digital cameras can display images on a screen immediately after being recorded, and store and delete images from memory. Most digital cameras can also record moving videos with sound. Some digital cameras can crop and stitch pictures and perform other elementary image editing.|$|R
50|$|A remote <b>pickup</b> <b>unit</b> or RPU is a {{radio system}} using special radio {{frequencies}} {{set aside for}} electronic news gathering (ENG) and remote broadcasting. It {{can also be used}} for other types of point-to-point radio links.|$|R
50|$|The tower has {{wrap-around}} outside platforms at 900, 1100 and 1400 {{feet on the}} tower. The platforms support antennas {{and equipment}} cabinets used by various two way radio systems and remote <b>pickup</b> <b>unit</b> (RPU) receivers for radio broadcasters.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Beam Position Monitor (BPM) system is to measure the beam orbit in the accelerator. The BPM data {{will be used for}} {{correcting}} closed orbit distortions (COD), and to optimize the operation of the rings. At KEKB the data are also used for analyzing the alignment and strength errors of magnetic components in the rings. The latter purpose requires a BPM system with good stability and high precision. This cannot be easily realized with a “fast ” system where the beam positions are measured every turn. Therefore, the system adopted at KEKB is a “slow ” system, where measurements are performed for the beam positions averaged over many turns. A similar system has been used at TRISTAN for several years, and its operation has been well proven. An electrostatic <b>pickup</b> <b>unit</b> at KEKB consists of four disk electrodes. A <b>pickup</b> <b>unit</b> will be installed near every quadrupole magnet in the two rings. There will be about 450 BPMs to be installed in each ring; in total there will be 900 <b>pickup</b> <b>units</b> for the entire KEKB. Since a multi-bunch, high-current beam will be stored at KEKB (LER 2. 6 A, HER 1. 1 A) special attention must be paid to the design of the pickups, transmission lines, switches and front-end electronics. This section outlines the BPM system design for KEKB. 11. 1. 1 <b>Pickup</b> <b>unit</b> The important design considerations of the BPM pickup electrodes are as follows: • Reduce the pickup beam power by using electrodes with a small cross section (diameter 12 mm) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} cameras using three <b>image</b> <b>pickups,</b> {{one for each}} primary color, was first {{developed}} for color photography on three glass plates {{in the late nineteenth}} century, and in the 1960s through 1980s was the dominant method to record color images in television, as other possibilities to record more than one color on the video camera tube were difficult.|$|R
50|$|A {{dedicated}} circuit, private circuit, or {{leased line}} is a line that is dedicated to only one use. Originally, this was analog, and was often used by radio stations as a studio/transmitter link (STL) or remote <b>pickup</b> <b>unit</b> (RPU) for their audio, sometimes as a backup to other means. Later lines were digital, and used for private corporate data networks.|$|R
5000|$|Early Gibson pickup winding {{machines}} were manually operated {{and had no}} mechanism to automatically cut the wire after a set number of turns. Thus every pickup had a different number of windings and that led to variation in the output and tone. For the same reason, the two coils within each <b>pickup</b> <b>unit</b> usually also have a slightly different number of turns ...|$|R
5000|$|An RPU {{is used to}} send program {{material}} from a remote location to the broadcast station or network. Usually these systems use specialized, high audio fidelity radio equipment. One manufacturer, Marti, was best known for manufacturing remote pickup equipment, {{so much so that}} the name is usually used to refer to a remote <b>pickup</b> <b>unit</b> regardless of who the actual equipment manufacturer actually is.|$|R

5000|$|There {{were very}} few {{products}} seen on the market that could write data to these discs. Most notable was the Topy Mini Writer, which retailed for $130 (USD) and housed an optical <b>pickup</b> <b>unit</b> (<b>image</b> №4) with a USB interface board, allowing the use of DataPlay discs much like other end-user writable optical media (e.g., CD-Rs). Other noted products were the iriver IDP-100 and the MTV Video Device [...] "MTV FLIP", which both housed the prototype-based model (image №2).|$|R
50|$|In {{broadcast}} engineering, {{a remote}} broadcast (usually just called a remote or a live remote, or in news parlance, a live shot) is broadcasting done from a location {{away from a}} formal television studio and is considered an electronic field production (EFP). A remote <b>pickup</b> <b>unit</b> (RPU) is usually used to transmit the audio and/or video back to the television station, where it joins the normal airchain. Other methods include satellite trucks, production trucks and even regular telephone lines if necessary.|$|R
50|$|VoC is also rapidly gaining use in {{electronic}} news-gathering and remote broadcasting, {{where it is}} used in place of remote <b>pickup</b> <b>units</b> (RPUs), which must be temporarily fixed in a certain position, with an antenna often on a telescoping pole or satellite dish atop an outside broadcast van. RPUs are also limiting in terms of setup time and space, safety regarding overhead powerlines, and the requirement for a line of sight back to the TV station or a remote receiving antenna.|$|R
50|$|Many {{stations}} {{have some sort}} of television studio, which on major-network stations is often used for newscasts or other local programming. There is usually a news department, where journalists gather information. There is also a section where electronic news-gathering (ENG) operations are based, receiving remote broadcasts via remote <b>pickup</b> <b>unit</b> or satellite TV. Outside broadcasting vans, production trucks, or SUVs with electronic field production (EFP) equipment are sent out with reporters, who may also bring back news stories on video tape rather than sending them back live.|$|R

50|$|WLNT has had {{the same}} call letters and format since its {{inception}} in August 2002, first broadcasting from a transmitter on Prospect Church Road. In December 2002, the station petitioned the Federal Communications Commission to relocate its transmitter about 3500 ft east-northeast to its present site on Matlock Ridge in Loudon. This move increased WLNT's coverage, since the Matlock Ridge site is line-of-sight to {{a large part of the}} area's population.WLNT utilizes studio/transmitter link WPWW-390 at 951.5 MHz and remote <b>pickup</b> <b>unit</b> WPVX-964 at 161.64, 161.67, and 161.70 MHz.|$|R
50|$|The Contax i4R is {{a digital}} camera {{manufactured}} by Kyocera. The i4R was announced on 28 September 2004. Its design {{was one of the}} more unusual of Contax's designs. Kyocera released it to the public in November, 2004 with a price of 299 GBP. The i4R features a Carl Zeiss Tessar T* 6.5mm f/2.8 lens. Its <b>image</b> <b>pickup</b> device is a charge-coupled device with 4.19 &times; 106 gross pixels. The i4R is PictBridge-compliant. Besides its usually small size for the time, its other unusual feature was its ability to focus down to about two inches (five centimetres).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a special photodiode array layout {{to be used}} in optical <b>pickup</b> <b>units</b> in combination with optical storage systems. Apart from the features that a standard array offers, this design enables higher resolution of the data recovery diodes. Furthermore, additional diodes for the determination of the spatial light intensity are included. The special layout of the array ensures crosstalk isolation and linearizes the spectral response of the data recovery diodes, enabling lower circuitry requirements for the readout of the photocurrent. The structure was fabricated in standard 0. 6 mu m twin well CMOS technology...|$|R
5000|$|Ironically, {{given the}} controversy, the retail Slingbox {{hardware}} has found an unexpected niche market in television broadcasting. Broadcast engineers at several TV stations have installed them at remote [...] "towercam" [...] locations to observe traffic and weather conditions. KPIX-TV in San Francisco has several connected with wireless networking, using EV-DO via a cellular network (mobile phone) provider. This costs {{only a few}} hundred dollars for each site, versus well over ten thousand for a setup with a remote <b>pickup</b> <b>unit</b> and auxiliary broadcast licenses. However, the system is not yet reliable or broadband enough to handle live remote broadcasts.|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} obtaining {{electronic}} chroma signals {{with a single}} scanning-type image device is described. A color multiplexed light signal is produced using an arrangement of dichroic filter stripes. In the particular system described, a two layer filter is used to color modulate external light which is then detected by an <b>image</b> <b>pickup</b> tube. The resulting time division multiplexed electronic signal from the pickup tube is converted by a decoder into a green color signal, and a single red-blue multiplexed signal, which is demultiplexed to produce red and blue color signals. The three primary color signals can be encoded as standard NTSC color signals...|$|R
50|$|A {{jointless}} {{track circuit}} {{such as the}} CSEE can be divided with a data <b>pickup</b> <b>unit</b> (DPU), which is cheaper than splitting it into two track circuits. A DPU avoids the {{need to change the}} frequency of a whole series of track circuits in a cascade. The DPU consists of a tuned coil which detects {{the presence or absence of}} current in the adjacent rail and picks up or drops a relay accordingly. One use of DPUs is for timing circuits. Each track circuit frequency has its own DPU tuned to that frequency. DPUs can be located almost anywhere; they overcome the limitation that jointless tracks have a minimum length.|$|R
50|$|In mid-November 2009, {{reporter}} Tom Jones and {{a cameraman}} escaped serious injury when the telescoping radio mast of their electronic news-gathering van (holding a microwave antenna for the remote <b>pickup</b> <b>unit</b> used for outside broadcasting) contacted 115-kilovolt high-voltage powerlines while leaving the Fulton County Jail. Georgia Power staff were surprised that anyone survived, {{but the two}} were treated for minor burns and smoke inhalation at Grady Memorial Hospital and released later in the day. The massive electric spark caused an explosion, left a crater underneath the van, arced to and broke a water main, and caused a brief power outage; the vehicle was a total loss.|$|R
50|$|Microwave {{radio is}} used in {{broadcasting}} and telecommunication transmissions because, due to their short wavelength, highly directional antennas are smaller and therefore more practical {{than they would be}} at longer wavelengths (lower frequencies). There is also more bandwidth in the microwave spectrum than {{in the rest of the}} radio spectrum; the usable bandwidth below 300 MHz is less than 300 MHz while many GHz can be used above 300 MHz. Typically, microwaves are used in television news to transmit a signal from a remote location to a television station from a specially equipped van. See broadcast auxiliary service (BAS), remote <b>pickup</b> <b>unit</b> (RPU), and studio/transmitter link (STL).|$|R
50|$|Originally, analog audio {{broadcasts}} {{were sent}} through telephone hybrids, which, although low quality, {{were found to}} be acceptable for voice broadcasts. Later, frequency extenders were developed that used additional lines, shifting higher treble audio frequencies down on one end and back up on the other, providing a reasonable reproduction of the original sound. Currently, digital lines, such as ISDN or DSL, are used to send compressed digital audio back to the studio. In addition, modern remote <b>pickup</b> <b>units</b> have become extremely portable and can transmit single-channel monophonic FM-quality audio over regular telephone lines using built-in modems and advanced compression algorithms (MPEG-4, etc.). See POTS codec.|$|R

40|$|A {{theory of}} optical {{trapping}} at low Numerical Aperture (NA) is presented. The theory offers an analytical {{description of the}} competition between the stabilizing gradient and destabilizing scattering force. The trade-off can be characterized by a single dimensionless trapping parameter, which increases with bead size to wavelength ratio ?/?, m, NA and refractive index contrast m and decreases with NA. The gradient force dominates for small trapping parameters, the scattering force for large trapping parameters. The potential well depth, maximum forces and trap stiffness {{as a function of}} the three parameters (?/?, m, NA) can be mapped onto universal functions of the trapping parameter. These functions do not depend on any free parameter.

50|$|The Apollo TV Camera {{refers to}} several {{television}} cameras {{used in the}} Apollo program's space missions, and on the later Skylab and Apollo-Soyuz Test Project missions, in the late 1960s and 1970s. These cameras varied in design, with image quality improving significantly with each successive model. Two companies made these various camera systems: RCA and Westinghouse. Originally, these slow-scan television (SSTV) cameras, running at 10 frames-per-second (fps), produced only black-and-white pictures and first flew on the Apollo 7 mission in October 1968. A color camera — using a field-sequential color system — flew on the Apollo 10 mission in May 1969, and every mission after that. The Color Camera ran at the North American standard 30 fps. The cameras all used <b>image</b> <b>pickup</b> tubes that were initially fragile, as one was irreparably damaged during the live broadcast of the Apollo 12 mission's first moonwalk. Starting with the Apollo 15 mission, a more robust, damage-resistant camera was used on the lunar surface. All of these cameras required signal processing back on Earth to make the frame rate and color encoding compatible with analog broadcast television standards.|$|R
