40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{of this research}} are to propose a general stochastic method for determining analytically the distribution of <b>flood</b> <b>volume,</b> {{and to develop a}} simulation procedure for generating synthetic multiseason streamflows at different sites simultaneously. The research study is divided into two parts: (a) First, a general stochastic model is proposed to derive analytically the probability distribution function for <b>flood</b> <b>volume.</b> The volume of a flood is defined as the sum of an unbroken sequence of consecutive daily flows above a given truncation level. Analytical expressions were then derived for the exact distribution of <b>flood</b> <b>volume</b> for various cases in which successive flow exceedances can be assumed to be either independent or correlated, and the cumulative flow exceedance can be considered to be independent or dependent of the corresponding flood duration. The proposed stochastic method is more general and more flexible than empirical fitting approach because it can take explicitly into account different stochastic properties inherent in the underlying streamflow process. Results of a numerical application have shown that the proposed model could provide a very good fit between observed and theoretical results. Further, in the estimation of <b>flood</b> <b>volume</b> distribution, it has been found that the effect of the serial correlation property of the flow series is not significant as compared to the impact due to the dependence between <b>flood</b> <b>volume</b> and corresponding duration. Finally, it has been demonstrated that the simplistic assumption of triangular flood hydrograph shape, as usually appeared in previous studies, is not necessary in the estimation of <b>flood</b> <b>volume</b> distribution.

40|$|The storm {{hyetograph}} {{is critical}} in drainage design since it determines the peak <b>flooding</b> <b>volume</b> in a catchment and the corresponding drainage capacity demand for a return period. This study firstly compares the common design storms such as the Chicago, Huff, and Triangular curves employed to represent the storm hyetographs {{in the metropolitan area}} of Guangzhou using minute-interval rainfall data during 2008 – 2012. These common design storms cannot satisfactorily represent the storm hyetographs in sub-tropic areas of Guangzhou. The normalized time of peak rainfall is at 33 ± 5 % for all storms in the Tianhe and Panyu districts, and most storms (84 %) are in the 1 st and 2 nd quartiles. The Huff curves are further improved by separately describing the rising and falling limbs instead of classifying all storms into four quartiles. The optimal time intervals are 1 – 5 min for deriving a practical urban design storm, especially for short-duration and intense storms in Guangzhou. Compared to the 71 observed storm hyetographs, the Improved Huff curves have smaller RMSE and higher NSE values (6. 43, 0. 66) than those of the original Huff (6. 62, 0. 63), Triangular (7. 38, 0. 55), and Chicago (7. 57, 0. 54) curves.

40|$|Karst-related {{flooding}} {{occurs in}} several depressions between Le Roy and Caledonia, NY, USA. The timing of these flood events {{suggests that a}} regional groundwater phenomenon contributes to the flood volumes, in addition to contributions by surface water and subsurface quickflow. To gain {{better understanding of the}} proportions of these components, two watersheds near Le Roy (Britt Road and Quinlan Road) were studied in detail. A rainfall-runoff model was constructed in the PCRaster language to quantify the portion of <b>flood</b> <b>volume</b> originating from surface runoff for two different flood events. For an event in October 2006, runoff explained the entire <b>flood</b> <b>volume</b> in the Quinlan Road watershed. For an event at the end of November 2006, the contribution of surface runoff to the <b>flood</b> <b>volume</b> was about 49 % and 46 % for the Britt Road and Quinlan Road watershed, respectively. The remaining part of the <b>flood</b> <b>volume</b> must have been derived from subsurface quick flow or groundwater. In these model simulations swampy areas and the flood zone were assumed to be impermeable, simulating the presence of a high water table. Without this assumption all the surface water entering the flood zone would infiltrate into the subsurface. From a sensitivity analysis it was found that microtopography storage is an influential parameter in runoff generation in these watersheds. 	These findings suggest that high groundwater levels are the main driving force behind the floodings. Without a groundwater level close to the land surface in the Britt Road watershed or groundwater mounding at the sinkholes in the Quinlan Road watershed, no flooding would occur. However, to accurately quantify the quickflow and groundwater components contributing to the floodings, additional research needs to be performed at the actual time of flooding...|$|E
40|$|Flood {{frequency}} analysis is usually performed as a univariate analysis of flood peaks using a suitable theoretical probability {{distribution of the}} annual maximum flood peaks or peak over threshold values. However, other flood attributes, such as <b>flood</b> <b>volume</b> and duration, are necessary {{for the design of}} hydrotechnical projects, too. In this study, the suitability of various copula families for a bivariate analysis of peak discharges and flood volumes has been tested. Streamflow data from selected gauging stations along the whole Danube River have been used. Kendall’s rank correlation coefficient (tau) quantifies the dependence between flood peak discharge and <b>flood</b> <b>volume</b> settings. The methodology is applied to two different data samples: 1) annual maximum flood (AMF) peaks combined with annual maximum flow volumes of fixed durations at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 60 days, respectively (which can be regarded as a regime analysis of the dependence between the extremes of both variables in a given year), and 2) annual maximum flood (AMF) peaks with corresponding flood volumes (which is a typical choice for engineering studies).

The daily outflow of the catchment, which is dominated by spring snowmelt runoff, was simulated by the coupling of snowmelt and soil moisture accounting models of the US National Weather Service River Forecast System. Two threshold levels were used to define a flood day - the double and triple long-term mean daily streamflow - and the flood parameters (occurrences, duration, magnitude, etc.) for these cases were determined. Despite the complicated response of flood events to temperature increase and threshold, both hypothetical and monthly GISS representations of climate change resulted in more and longer flood events for climates with increased precipitation. All climates yielded larger <b>flood</b> <b>volumes</b> and greater mean values of flood peaks with respect to precipitation increase.

From a geomorphological perspective, this thesis addresses problems with small branch and log dams, and how to make them more resilient and sustainable in regard to erosion, sediment deposition, and flood control. During 2014 four dams were constructed in Soknedal, Norway, an area prone to flooding and landslides. Alterations in the dams were recorded during fieldwork undertaken throughout the Autumn and Winter of 2014 - 2015. These records are combined with theory to answer the aforementioned problems. A dry Autumn and Winter resulted in low dam activity, with no flooding or erosion recorded, nevertheless there was a noticeable amount of fine sediment deposition in two of the dams. Observations and theory suggest that these sediments will be subsequently eroded and transported downstream during a flood. One might consider constructing taller dams if rapid sediment deposition in a short time span is a problem. Taller dams require better erosion control, but would reduce the <b>flood</b> <b>volume</b> more efficiently.

The closely related ideas of the hundred-year flood and the hundred-year floodplain became standard terminology for communicating flood risk, but the knowledge behind them has been called into doubt by the realization of rapid, anthropogenic climate change...|$|R
