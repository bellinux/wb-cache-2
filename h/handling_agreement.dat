40|$|Contract law {{is applied}} countless times every day, in every manner of {{transaction}} large or small. Rarely are those transactions reflected in an agreement {{produced by a}} lawyer; quite the contrary, almost all contracts are concluded by persons with no legal training and often by persons {{who do not have}} a great deal of education. In recent years, moreover, technological advances have provided novel methods of creating contracts. Those facts present practitioners of contract law with an interesting conundrum: The law must be sensible and stable if parties are to have confidence in the security of their arrangements; but contract law also must be able to handle changing social and economic circumstances, changes that occur at an ever-increasing speed. Contract law, originally designed to <b>handle</b> <b>agreements</b> reached by persons familiar with one another, evolved over time to solve the problems posed by contract formation that was done at a distance — that is, contract law had developed to handle first paper, then telegraphic, and finally telephonic communications. It has handled those changes very well. In the 1990 s, however, things began to change. The rise in computer use by individuals coupled with the advent of the World Wide Web gave rise to two parallel developments, both of which challenged the law of contract formation. Increased computer use created a demand for software programs designed for the consumer market, and those programs were commonly transferred to users by way of standard-form licenses that were packaged with the software and thus unavailable before the consumer paid for the software. Also, parties in large numbers began to use electronic means — the computer — to enter into bargained-for relationships. The turn of the millennium brought two electronic contracting statutes, the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (“E-Sign”) and the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (“UETA”), which removed any doubts that contracts entered into electronically could satisfy the Statute of Frauds. Encouraged by the certainty given by those statutes, internet businesses started offering contract terms on their websites, asking customers to consent to terms by clicking an icon, or by not seeking express assent at all by presenting terms of use by hyperlink. The ease of presenting terms comprised of thousands of words by an internet hyperlink makes it easy for a vendor in its terms of use and terms of service to ask us to give up privacy rights and intellectual property rights. Modern communications technologies therefore make it easier for parties to engage in risky transactions. Nevertheless, we believe that, with few exceptions, the common law of contracts is sufficiently malleable to address the problems arising out of that behavior and where it is not, regulation of contract terms is appropriate. This Article examines those developments...|$|R

We study fusion methods that can successfully cope with situations of agreement, partial agreement, and disagreement between sensors. We define a set of specifications for fusion methods appropriate for MRMS environments. In light of these specifications, we review two popular algorithms for probabilistic sensor fusion, Linear Opinion Pool (LOP) and Logarithmic Opinion Pool (LGP). To overcome difficulties of applying them to a MRMS setting, a new method is introduced, p-norm Opinion Pool (POP). Comparing to LOP and LGP, POP is more compatible with the specifications and more flexible, successfully <b>handling</b> situations of <b>agreement</b> and disagreement between sensors.

This paper assumes that there is a scheduling agent and it has the knowledge about user preferences, meeting participants’profile, holds a reasoning mechanism to evaluate a meeting invitation, and capable of selecting negotiation strategies automatically. The proposed negotiation protocol assists the meeting scheduling agent to handle bilateral and multilateral negotia- tion scenarios.

40|$|In this paper, the {{development}} of three-dimensional (3 -D) millimeter-wave functions in multilayer low temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC) and liquid crystal polymer (LCP) technologies is presented for millimeter-wave compact and easy-to-design passive solutions for high data rate wireless systems. Both ceramic and organic technologies are candidates for the 3 -D integration of system-on-package (SOP) miniaturized RF/microwave/millimeter-wave systems. LTCC has been widely used as a packaging material because of its process maturity/stability and its relatively high dielectric constant that enables {{a significant reduction in}} the module/function dimensions. As an alternative, LCP is an organic material that offers a unique combination of electrical, chemical, and mechanical properties, enabling high-frequency designs due to its ability to act as both the substrate and the package for flexible and conformal multilayer functions. A LTCC patch resonator filter that uses vertical coupling overlap and transverse cuts as design parameters has been designed to achieve a high level of miniaturization and a great compromise between compactness and power <b>handling.</b> Excellent <b>agreement</b> between the simulation and the measurement has been verified for two operating frequency bands (58 - 60 GHz/ 38 - 40 GHz) of RF communications and sensors for applications such as wireless broadband internet or inter-satellite communications.

The design exploits the ripple near the cut off frequency of Tchebysheff low pass filter to create a band pass response and it exhibits the insertion loss as low as 1. 5 dB at the center frequency of 60 GHz and 3 -dB bandwidth of 16. 7 % (~ 10 GHz) ...|$|R

The main empirical evidence we adduce in support of our claim comes from a novel analysis of French past participle agreement which builds on earlier work by Radford and Vincent (2007) and Vincent (2007). In section 2, we briefly characterise French past participle agreement, and outline the key assumptions which our analysis makes.

40|$|We {{present the}} most {{complete}} and accurate first-principles model of photoreflectance (PR) spectra from strained quantum wells currently in the field. We calculate the PR spectrum, DR/R, by taking the difference between reflectivities {{as a function of}} quantum well absorption under electric fields representing the pump beam on and off. We calculate the band-to-band quantum well absorption using Fermi 2 ̆ 7 s Golden Rule, convolved with a Lorentzian lineshape. The Lorentzian broadened excitonic absorption includes variationally calculated binding energies. A 6 band Luttinger-Kohn k·p bandstructure calculation, including strain and valence-band mixing, provides dispersion relations, matrix elements, and wavefunctions. ^ We compared the calculated PR spectrum for a 100 Å In 0. 18 Ga 0. 82 As/GaAs single quantum well with the experimental spectrum with excellent agreement. Our results agreed very well with experimental photoluminescence and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy data and with another group 2 ̆ 7 s empirical fit evaluation of the experimental PR spectrum from a similar sample. They identified one heavy-hole state in a particular energy region where we identified two closely spaced heavy-hole states. Our theoretical PR spectra compared favorably with the experimental spectra for two AlxGa 1 -xAs/GaAs single quantum wells in the literature. ^ Three other models exist for calculating the PR spectrum from quantum wells. The first PR model was a semi-empirical first derivative calculation. The second calculated the PR spectrum from an excitonic dielectric constant first derivative. Our model calculates both the excitonic and band-to-band absorption for two fields without assuming a derivative form. Our theoretical PR spectra matched these experimental spectra better than their theoretical models did. The third PR model used the band-to-band absorption derivative to calculate the spectrum for a superlattice, which our model was not designed to <b>handle.</b> The <b>agreement</b> between their experimental and theoretical spectra was poor. ^ We determined sensitivity of the PR spectrum to various parameters. The excitonic contribution dominated, but the band-to-band contribution provided a significant background spectrum. The spectrum was fairly sensitive to quantum well width, composition, and conduction band offset. The spectrum was very sensitive to the high electric field (10 kV/cm). This first principles model provides {{a deeper understanding of the}} physics of photoreflectance spectroscopy. ...|$|R
