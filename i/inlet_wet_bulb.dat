40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{we present}} {{thermodynamic}} analysis of counter flow wet cooling towers and evaporative heat exchangers using both {{the first and}} second laws of thermodynamics. A parametric study is carried out to determine the variation of second-law efficiency as well as exergy destruction as a function of various input parameters such as <b>inlet</b> <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> temperature. Irreversible losses are determined by applying an exergy balance on each of the systems investigated. In this regard, an engineering equation solver (EES) program, with built-in functions for most thermodynamic and transport properties, is used. The concept of total exergy as the sum of thermomechanical and chemical parts is employed in calculating the flow exergies for air and water vapor mixtures. For the different input variables investigated, efficiencies were, almost always, seen to increase or decrease monotonically. We notice that an increase in the <b>inlet</b> <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> temperature invariably increases the second-law efficiency of all the heat exchangers. Also, it is shown that Bejan’s definition of second-law efficiency is not limited in evaluating performance. Furthermore, it is understood that the variation in the dead state does not significantly affect the overall efficiency of the system. © 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} model {{was developed and}} {{used to assess the}} sensitivity of thermal performance characteristics of a closed wet cooling tower to inlet air conditions. In the present study, three cases of different ambient conditions are considered: In the first case, the average mid-winter and mid-summer conditions as well as the extreme case of high temperature and relative humidity, in Athens (Greece) during summer are considered according to the Greek Regulation for Buildings Energy Performance. In the second case, the varied inlet air relative humidity while the inlet air dry bulb temperature remains constant were taken into account. In the last case, the effects on cooling tower thermal behaviour when the inlet air wet bulb temperature remains constant were examined. The proposed model is capable of predicting the variation of air thermodynamic properties, sprayed water and serpentine water temperature inside the closed wet cooling tower along its height. The reliability of simulations was tested against experimental data, which were obtained from literature. Thus, the proposed model could be used for the design of industrial and domestic applications of conventional air-conditioning systems as well as for sorption cooling systems with solid and liquid desiccants where closed wet cooling towers are used for precooling the liquid solutions. The most important result of this theoretical investigation is that the highest fall of serpentine water temperature and losses of sprayed water are observed for the lowest value of <b>inlet</b> <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> temperature. Hence, the thermal effectiveness, which is associated with the temperature reduction of serpentine water as well as the operational cost, which is related to the sprayed water loss due to evaporation, of a closed wet cooling tower depend predominantly on the degree of saturation of inlet air.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to find a proper solution for the cross-flow water cooling tower problem, also to find an empirical correlation's controlling heat and mass transfer coefficients as functions of inlet parameters to the tower. This is achieved by constructing an experimental rig and a computer program. The computer simulation solves the problem numerically. The apparatus used in this study comprises a cross-flow cooling tower. From the results obtained, the 'characteristic curve' of cross-flow cooling towers was constructed. This curve is very helpful for designers in order to find the actual value of the number of transfer units, if the values of inlet water temperature or <b>inlet</b> air <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> temperature are changed.

40|$|An {{analytical}} model {{was developed to}} describe thermodynamically the water evaporation process inside a counter-flow wet cooling tower, where the air stream is {{in direct contact with}} the failing water, based on the implementation of the energy and mass balance between air and water stream describing thus, the rate of change of air temperature, humidity ratio, water temperature and evaporated water mass along tower height. The reliability of model predictions was ensured by comparisons made with pertinent experimental data, which were obtained from the literature. The paper elaborated the effect of atmospheric conditions, water mass flow rate and water inlet temperature on the variation of the thermodynamic properties of moist air inside the cooling tower and on its thermal performance characteristics. The analysis of the theoretical results revealed that the thermal performance of the cooling tower is sensitive to the degree of saturation of inlet air. Hence, the cooling capacity of the cooling tower increases with decreasing <b>inlet</b> air <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> temperature whereas the overall water temperature fall is curtailed with increasing water to air mass ratio. The change of inlet water temperature does not affect seriously the thermal behaviour of the cooling tower. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

A multivariate regression model was developed to simulate the operating variables of an air-cooled chiller with mist precooling. The model was validated with typical performance data of an air-cooled centrifugal chiller.
