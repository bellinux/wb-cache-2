5|$|In August 2007, the MBTA {{published}} a feasibility study exploring {{the possibility of}} rebuilding Yawkey as a full-service station. The study concluded that doing so would increase ridership by 60%, from 585 daily boardings and alightings to 937. On November 15, 2010, Governor Deval Patrick and other officials broke ground on a major rebuilding of the station, originally {{expected to be completed}} in the spring of 2012. The new station has two full-length high-level platforms that provide level, handicapped-accessible boarding for all passengers; the old platform had only a wooden ramp for accessibility. The two 700-foot-long platforms (a side platform between the tracks plus a side platform {{on the south side of}} the tracks) are connected with an overpass, and passengers no longer <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> the tracks to access certain outbound trains.|$|E
5|$|In the {{operation}} the 6th Airborne Division {{together with the}} 7th Armoured Division, the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division and the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division, formed the I Corps, attached to the First Canadian Army. When issuing his orders, Lieutenant General John Crocker, the Corps commander, aware that the 6th Airborne had almost no artillery, vehicles or engineer equipment, did not expect them to advance quickly. To reach the River Seine the division would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> three main rivers, along only two main lines of advance. One route was in the north, running along the French coast, while the other route was further inland between Troarn and Pont Audemer.|$|E
5|$|The American {{troops who}} were not killed or {{captured}} escaped behind the fortified American positions centered on Brooklyn Heights. Howe then ordered all of his troops to halt the attack, in a move considered controversial to this day, despite the protests of many officers in his command who believed that they should push on to Brooklyn Heights. Howe had decided against a direct frontal assault against the entrenched American positions, choosing instead to begin a siege and setting up lines of circumvallation around the American positions. He believed the Americans to be essentially trapped, with his troops blocking escape by land and the Royal Navy {{in control of the}} East River, which they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> to reach Manhattan Island.|$|E

5|$|After {{the capture}} of Breville the {{division}} was not attacked in force again, apart from an almost continuous artillery bombardment between 18 and 20June. Further reinforcements arrived east of the River Orne on 20July, when the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division moved into {{the line between the}} 6th Airborne and the 51st (Highland) Division. On 7August Gale was ordered to prepare the division to move over to the offensive, with its objective being the mouth of the River Seine. The three divisions east of the Orne together became I Corps; its commander, Lieutenant General John Crocker, knowing that the 6th Airborne had almost no artillery, vehicles or engineer equipment, did not expect it to advance very quickly. To reach the Seine, the division would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> three major rivers. There were two main lines of advance, the road running along the coast and another road further inland from Troarn to Pont Audemer. The commando brigade and the two parachute brigades would use the inland route, with the 3rd Parachute Brigade being responsible for the breakout when the time was right.|$|E
5|$|All {{populations are}} migratory, and most birds winter in Africa {{south of the}} Sahara, {{with just a few}} records from Pakistan, Morocco and Israel. Migration is mainly at night, singly or in loose groups of up to twenty birds. European breeders cross the Mediterranean and North Africa, whereas eastern populations move through the Middle East and East Africa. Some Asian birds may {{therefore}} cross 100° of longitude on their travels. Most birds winter in eastern or southeastern Africa, although individuals of the nominate race have been recently discovered wintering in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; records elsewhere in West Africa may be wintering birds of this subspecies or C. e. meridionalis. Most autumn migration takes place from August to September, and the birds return to the breeding grounds by May. Recent tracking data has revealed that European nightjars have a loop migration from Western Europe to sub-equatorial Africa where they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> several ecological barriers (Mediterranean Sea, Sahara and the Central African Tropical Rainforest). Individuals use similar stop-over sites as do other European migrants. Vagrants have occurred in Iceland, the Faroe Islands, the Seychelles, the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the well-connected {{owners of}} Cross Sound Ferry {{proposed}} a footbridge from the Water Street parking garage to the ferry slips so that ferry passengers would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> Water Street and the tracks at grade. Amtrak saw {{the project as}} an opportunity to build a new elevated station nearby and contributed $1 million to the design of the bridge. However, Amtrak reversed course in 1999 and decided to keep using Union Station; in 2001, the railroad declined to fund the footbridge. Also in 2001, Amtrak built a pair of high-level platforms to serve the new Acela Express high-speed service, thus adapting the 19th-century station for 21st-century usage. Catenary wires were installed over the tracks as part of the introduction of the Acela. Later that year or early in 2002, the 1899-built freight house {{on the east side of}} the tracks was torn down as part of redevelopment sponsored by the New London Development Corporation. The freight house had previously been used by Amtrak maintenance-of-way crews, and before that by the Fishers Island Ferry District.|$|E

5|$|The {{problem of}} {{counting}} {{the number of}} solutions to different types of Apollonius' problem belongs to the field of enumerative geometry. The general number of solutions for each of the ten types of Apollonius' problem is given in Table1 above. However, special arrangements of the given elements may change the number of solutions. For illustration, Apollonius' problem has no solution if one circle separates the two (Figure11); to touch both the solid given circles, the solution circle would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> the dashed given circle; but that it cannot do, if it is to touch the dashed circle tangentially. Conversely, if three given circles are all tangent at the same point, then any circle tangent at the same point is a solution; such Apollonius problems have an infinite number of solutions. If any of the given circles are identical, there is likewise an infinity of solutions. If only two given circles are identical, there are only two distinct given circles; the centers of the solution circles form a hyperbola, as used in one solution to Apollonius' problem.|$|E
5|$|The prosecution's {{theory of}} the case, as told in its opening {{statement}} to the jury, was that Thornton, having failed {{in his attempt to}} seduce Ashford, lay in wait for her in the field near the pit. He knew she would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> the field on her return from Erdington. On perceiving him, she attempted to elude him, but he caught her and got her to accompany him into the next field. There, he threw her down and ravished her. The post-mortem showed that she had not eaten in 24hours, and according to the prosecuting counsel, she was unable to resist and fainted. Fearing the consequences were he to be caught with an unconscious woman whom he had treated in such a manner, Thornton threw her into the pit, where she drowned. At that time, defence counsel were not permitted to address the jury, and the matter proceeded with the prosecution case.|$|E
5|$|Washington and {{the army}} were {{surrounded}} on Brooklyn Heights with the East River to their backs. As the day went on, the British began to dig trenches, slowly coming closer to the American defenses. By doing this, the British would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> over open ground to assault the American defenses {{as they did in}} Boston the year before. Despite this perilous situation, Washington ordered 1,200 more men from Manhattan to Brooklyn on August 28. The men that came over were two Pennsylvania regiments and Colonel John Glover's regiment from Marblehead, Massachusetts. In command of the Pennsylvanian troops was Thomas Mifflin who, after arriving, volunteered to inspect the outer defenses and report back to Washington. In these outer defenses, small skirmishes were still taking place. On the afternoon of August 28, it began to rain and Washington had his cannons bombard the British well into the night.|$|E

5|$|The {{innermost}} ward encloses an area immediately {{south of}} the White Tower, stretching to {{what was once the}} edge of the River Thames. As was the case at other castles, such as the 11th-century Hen Domen, the innermost ward was probably filled with timber buildings from the Tower's foundation. Exactly when the royal lodgings began to encroach from the White Tower into the innermost ward is uncertain, although it had happened by the 1170s. The lodgings were renovated and elaborated during the 1220s and 1230s, becoming comparable with other palatial residences such as Windsor Castle. Construction of Wakefield and Lanthorn Towers– located at the corners of the innermost ward's wall along the river– began around 1220. They probably served as private residences for the queen and king respectively. The earliest evidence for how the royal chambers were decorated comes from HenryIII's reign: the queen's chamber was whitewashed, and painted with flowers and imitation stonework. A great hall existed in the {{south of the}} ward, between the two towers. It was similar to, although slightly smaller than, that also built by HenryIII at Winchester Castle. Near Wakefield Tower was a postern gate which allowed private access to the king's apartments. The innermost ward was originally surrounded by a protective ditch, which had been filled in by the 1220s. Around this time, a kitchen was built in the ward. Between 1666 and 1676, the innermost ward was transformed and the palace buildings removed. The area around the White Tower was cleared so that anyone approaching would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> open ground. The Jewel House was demolished, and the Crown Jewels moved to Martin Tower.|$|E

25|$|However, {{some other}} commanders {{were worried about}} an assault on their {{extended}} front in Palestine.

To attack the city from the north, Wellington's main force would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> to the east bank of the Garonne, then drive south-east down the corridor between the two rivers.|$|E
25|$|Ruter has {{proposed}} {{building a new}} underground station at Majorstuen, which would be located closer to Valkyrie plass.

The proposed station would have an island platform, easing transfer between westbound lines, and allow access to both sides of Kirkeveien. The station is estimated to cost NOK1.8 billion and would have six entrances.|$|E

25|$|Early {{discussions on}} {{building}} a dedicated polar exploration ship for the British government had considered replicating Fridtjof Nansen's purpose-built ship Fram but that vessel was {{designed specifically for}} working through the pack ice of the Arctic, while the British ship would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> {{thousands of miles of}} open ocean before reaching the Antarctic so a more conventional design was chosen. In charge of her overall design was W.E. Smith, one of the senior naval architects at the Admiralty, while the ship's engine, boilers and other machinery were designed by Fleet Engineer Philip Marrack.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of this}} project, {{the known}} mineral and {{potential}} oil and gas deposits in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago were considered for development. Shipping the products {{proved to be an}} enormous problem; the sea lanes were ice-free for only a few months a year, and building a railhead to even the closest suitable shore point would still require hundreds of miles of rail to be laid over tundra. A pipeline would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> both land and water, and was likewise considered extremely difficult to build.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} late 1919 {{the leader of}} Russia's new Bolshevik government, Vladimir Lenin, {{inspired}} by the Red Army's civil-war victories over White Russian anti-communist forces and their Western allies, {{began to see the}} future of the revolution with greater optimism. The Bolsheviks proclaimed the need for the dictatorship of the proletariat, and agitated for a worldwide Communist community. They had an avowed intent to link the revolution in Russia with an expected revolution in Germany and to assist other Communist movements in Western Europe; Poland was the geographical bridge that the Red Army would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> to provide direct physical support in the West.|$|E
