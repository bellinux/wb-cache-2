5|$|The United States is {{the only}} {{advanced}} economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation {{and is one of}} just a few countries in the world without paid <b>family</b> <b>leave</b> as a legal right, with the others being Papua New Guinea, Suriname and Liberia. While federal law currently does not require sick leave, it is a common benefit for government workers and full-time employees at corporations. 74% of full-time American workers get paid sick leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, although only 24% of part-time workers get the same benefits. In 2009, the United States had the third-highest workforce productivity per person in the world, behind Luxembourg and Norway. It was fourth in productivity per hour, behind those two countries and the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the year, {{the boys}} must pass seven final exams to graduate. Anmar, Hyder and Ali each fail two subjects, and are given the option to retake the exams. Anmar passes the retakes and aspires to study English {{literature}} in college, and his family decide to move to the safer region of Arbul now that he has graduated. Hyder also retakes his exams and passes, but his family {{can no longer afford to}} pay for the university fees. Ali chooses not to retake the exams, and his <b>family</b> <b>leave</b> Iraq. Mohammad fails four subjects and must repeat his senior year. He chooses to do so at a different school while working at his uncle's scooter repair shop. As the documentary closes, it notes that during the year of filming, two of the boys' classmates were killed, six were kidnapped, and seventy-five left Iraq.|$|E

Lobbying came to the forefront due to the formation in 2001 of the DC Fiscal Policy Institute, a progressive think tank focused on local issues founded by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. As part of its lobbying effort, the Federal City Council sent representatives on a trade mission to China and worked to defeat a proposed paid <b>family</b> <b>leave</b> bill.|$|E

30|$|We {{distinguish}} four {{mechanisms in}} which {{female labor force}} participation and gender unemployment gaps can be related. First, career breaks, such as <b>family</b> <b>leaves,</b> are detrimental to human capital accumulation and productivity. Job-protected <b>family</b> <b>leaves</b> decrease the mothers’ post-leave earnings and employment (Albrecht et al. 1999; Beblo et al. 2009; Lalive and Zweimüller 2009) and therefore also {{increase the risk of}} subsequent unemployment. In addition, without job protection, <b>family</b> <b>leaves</b> are likely to be followed by spells of unemployment as women have to search for a job first when they return to the labor force (Johnson 1983). Finally, the presence of young children typically reduce productivity at work or the job search effort.|$|R

When Scrooge finally returns to Duckburg, he is the richest duck in the world, rivaled only by Flintheart Glomgold, John D. Rockerduck, and less prominently, the maharaja of the fictional country Howdoyoustan (play on Hindustan). His experiences, however, had changed him into a hostile miser, and he made his own <b>family</b> <b>leave.</b> Some 12 years later, he closed his empire down, but eventually returned to a public life 5 years later and started his business.|$|E
25|$|Simon (or Wicksy, {{as he is}} {{commonly}} known) is the second child born during Pete Beale's (Peter Dean) first marriage to the promiscuous Pat Beale (Pam St. Clement). After Pat and Pete's marriage deteriorates, Wicksy {{and his older brother}} David (Michael French) are adopted by Pat's second husband Brian Wicks (Leslie Schofield). In 1976, when Simon is 11, he and his <b>family</b> <b>leave</b> Walford due to David's rivalry with Derek Branning (Terence Beesley/Jamie Foreman). Simon grows to resent his mother for making his childhood a misery due to her alcoholism, not protecting him or David when they were beaten by Brian, and for her numerous affairs with different men.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, {{paleoanthropologist}} Francesco Mallegni conducted DNA {{testing on}} the recently excavated bodies of Ugolino and his children. His analysis {{agrees with the}} remains being a father, his sons and his grandsons. Additional comparison to DNA from modern day members of the Gherardesca <b>family</b> <b>leave</b> Mallegni about 98 percent sure that he has identified the remains correctly. However, the forensic analysis discredits the allegation of cannibalism. Analysis of the rib bones of the Ugolino skeleton reveals traces of magnesium, but no zinc, implying he had consumed no meat {{in the months before}} his death. Ugolino also had few remaining teeth and {{is believed to have been}} in his 70s when he was imprisoned, making it further unlikely that he could have outlived and eaten his descendants in captivity. Additionally, Mallegni notes that the putative Ugolino skull was damaged; perhaps he did not ultimately die of starvation, although malnourishment is evident.|$|E
25|$|Americans {{have the}} highest average {{employee}} income among OECD nations. The median household income in the US as of 2008 is $52,029. About 284,000 working people in the US have two full-time jobs and 7.6million have a part-time job {{in addition to their}} full-time employment. Of working individuals in the US, 12% belong to a labor union; most union members are government workers. The decline of union membership in the US over the last several decades parallels the decline of labor's share of the economy. The World Bank ranks the United States first in the ease of hiring and firing workers. The United States is the only advanced economy that does not legally guarantee its workers paid vacation or paid sick days, and is one of just a few countries in the world without paid <b>family</b> <b>leave</b> as a legal right, with the others being Papua New Guinea, Suriname and Liberia. In 2014, the International Trade Union Confederation graded the U.S a 4 out of 5+, its third lowest score, on the subject of powers and rights granted to labor unions.|$|E
25|$|At 28, Mukherji on {{a ticket}} with Carmelo Garcia won a six-way Democratic primary {{election}} for the Assembly by a 36-point margin in 2013 {{and won the}} November general election by a 20-point margin. He is the presently the state’s only South Asian legislator and the second in state history (after Upendra J. Chivukula). In the Legislature, Mukherji was appointed by Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto {{to serve on the}} Assembly Budget Committee in an appointment that raised eyebrows because of Mukherji’s status as a freshman lawmaker. The Budget Committee crafts the Legislature’s annual appropriations bill (the state budget), which was $33 billion in 2014. Mukherji also serves on the Commerce and Economic Development Committee, which is charged with improving the state’s economic climate and issues that affect job creation, urban enterprise zones, state and local redevelopment projects, corporate tax incentives, and business grant programs, and the Labor Committee, which is the panel that oversees legislation regarding unemployment, workers' compensation and disability benefits, employment law, workplace safety, employee training programs, <b>family</b> <b>leave,</b> and the minimum wage.|$|E

500|$|The {{television}} industry initially {{helped create a}} stereotype of the American nuclear family. During {{the era of the}} baby boomers, families became a popular social topic, especially on television. Family shows such as Roseanne, All in the <b>Family,</b> <b>Leave</b> It to Beaver, [...] The Cosby Show, Married... with Children, The Jeffersons, and Good Times, Everybody Loves Raymond have portrayed different social classes of families growing up in America. Those [...] "perfect" [...] nuclear families have changed as the years passed and have become more inclusive, showing single-parent and divorced families, as well as older singles. Television shows that show single-parent families include Half & Half, One on One, Murphy Brown, and Gilmore Girls.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Kennedy's dissent, {{joined by}} both Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas, argued that Congress simply had not {{established}} that the states [...] "engage in widespread {{discrimination on the basis}} of gender in the provision of <b>family</b> <b>leave</b> benefits." [...] Justice Kennedy believed the evidence summarized by the Court was too isolated and anecdotal to established such a pattern of discrimination. He also argued that the states had actually [...] "been ahead of Congress in providing gender-neutral <b>family</b> <b>leave</b> benefits." [...] The fact that gender classifications are subjected to heightened scrutiny, he said, [...] " [...] not alter [...] conclusion," [...] because Hibbs still bore the [...] "burden to show that Congress identified a history and pattern of unconstitutional employment discrimination by the States." [...] This was a burden, said Justice Kennedy, which Hibbs had not met. Thus the FMLA amounted to a substantive change in the reach of the Fourteenth Amendment, not an enforcement of its provisions, and under Boerne, this was unconstitutional.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the state}} level, California {{was the first}} state to offer paid <b>family</b> <b>leave</b> {{benefits}} for its workers. While the benefits only last for 6 weeks [...] this is the first major step for maternity leave in the United States. New Jersey lawmakers are pushing legislation that would make their state the second state to add this worker benefit. Under one New Jersey proposal, workers who take leave would be paid through the state’s temporary disability insurance fund, [...] "augmented by a 0.1 percent charge on workers’ weekly wages." [...] Traditionally, many conservatives have opposed paid <b>family</b> <b>leave,</b> but there is a sign that this mindset is beginning to change. Reverend Paul Schenck, a prominent member of the National Pro-Life Action Center recently stated that he would support paid maternity leave on the assumption that it might encourage women to follow through with their pregnancies instead of having abortions. According to Heyman, [...] "Across the political spectrum, people are realizing these policies have an enormous impact on working families. If you look at the most competitive economies in the world, all the others except the U.S. have these policies in place." ...|$|E
