Sixteen JME patients with cluster B PD, 38 JME patients without psychiatric disorders, and 30 healthy controls were Submitted to a psychiatric evaluation through SCID I and II and to a MRI scan. Significant reduction in thalami and increase in mesiofrontal and frontobasal regions' volumes were observed mainly in JME patients with PD. Structural alterations of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), involved in regulation of mood reactivity, impulsivity, and social behavior, were also observed. This study supports the hypothesis of frontobasal involvement in the pathophysiology of cluster B PD related to JME. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Proper understanding of the neurobiology of PD associated with JME could contribute to understanding the basis for earlier and more effective interventions. in the present study, volumetric and geometric features of cortical structure were assessed through an automated cortical surface reconstruction method aiming to verify possible structural cortical alterations among patients with JME. Twenty-two patients with JME with cluster B PD, 44 patients with JME without psychiatric disorders, and 23 healthy controls were submitted to a psychiatric evaluation through SCID I and SCID II and to an MRI scan. Significant cortical alterations in mesiofrontal and frontobasal regions, as well as in other limbic and paralimbic regions, were observed mainly in patients with JME with PD. the present study adds evidence to the hypothesis of frontal and limbic involvement in the pathophysiology of cluster B PD in JME, regions linked to mood and affective regulation, as well as to impulsivity and social behavior. Moreover, a multidimensional pattern of frontal, limbic, and paralimbic changes was observed through a method of structural analysis which offers different and simultaneous geometric features, allowing the elaboration of important pathophysiologic insights about cluster B PD in JME.

Literature data demonstrate worse seizure control and more psychosocial dysfunctions among patients with JME who have those traits. in this controlled study we performed a correlation analysis of psychiatric scores with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) values across JME patients, aiming to verify the existence of a possible relation between frontal lobe dysfunction and the prevalence of personality disorders (PDs) in JME. Sixteen JME patients with cluster B PDs, 41 JME patients without any psychiatric disorder, and 30 healthy controls were submitted to a psychiatric evaluation and to a quantitative multivoxel MRS of thalamus; insula; cingulate gyrus; striatum; and frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes. Groups were homogeneous according to age, gender, and manual dominance. Psychiatric evaluation was performed through the Scheduled Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, Axis I and II (SCID I and II, respectively).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Turner Syndrome (TS) {{is caused}} by {{monosomy}} or structural abnormalities of the X chromosome, with a prevalence of about 1 / 2000 females live birth. Most important clinical features of TS are short stature and gonadal failure. Approximately one third of girls with TS may undergo spontaneous puberty. Here {{we report on the}} case of a girl with a rare 45 X 0 / 47 XXX mosaic TS exhibiting a precocious puberty. Case report The patient was diagnosed with TS at the age of 4 years, upon a diagnostic work-up for dysmorphic features. Chromosome analysis revealed a mosaic karyotype (45 X 0 / 47 XXX). She presented with normal height and normal growth velocity so that Growth Hormone (GH) therapy was not started. She was referred to our Department at the age of 7 years and 10 months, because of vaginal bleeding. A physical examination revealed a Tanner stage III for breast and Tanner stage III for pubic hair development. Height and weight were within the normal range for age. Psychological evaluation showed moderate global developmental delay, together with <b>emotional</b> and social <b>immaturity</b> and reading difficulties. The growth rate was accelerated. Her bone age was 10 years. Pelvic ultrasound demonstrated increased size for age of both the uterus and the ovaries, with bilateral ovarian follicles. GnRH stimulation test revealed pubertal response of gonadotropins (peak LH 22. 5 mIU/ml). MRI of the brain was normal. These clinical, radiologic and laboratory findings were consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic central precocious puberty; therefore, GnRH analog therapy was started, in order to slow pubertal progression and to preserve adult stature. Furthermore, GH treatment was added to further improve adult height. CONCLUSION: Our case highlights the possibility of precocious puberty as an atypical clinical feature of TS. Thus, precocious puberty may occur in TS girls when a dosage compensation by the cell line with more than two X chromosomes allows normal ovarian function. GnRH analog therapy in addition to GH treatment should be recommended in TS girls with precocious puberty in order to slow pubertal progression and to preserve adult stature...|$|R
40|$|Aim. To {{identify}} the constitutional-biological, socio-demographic (microsocial) and clinical-dynamic (the debut of the disease) factors of predisposition to the depressive symptoms development {{in patients with}} paranoid schizophrenia. Materials and methods. A clinical-anamnestic, socio-demographic, clinical-psychopathological and pathopsychological examinations of 82 patients with paranoid schizophrenia with depressive symptoms identified and compared with 47 patients with paranoid schizophrenia without depressive symptoms. The study was managed using the PANSS, CDSS, HDRS scales and a questionnaire {{for the assessment of}} social functioning and quality of the mentally ill life. Groups did not differ in the basic demographic indicators. The study of constitutional and biological predisposition factors included the study of heredity and premorbid characterological features of patients. Socio-demographic (before the onset of the disease microsocial conditions and the current stage) factors –family relationships; characteristics of living conditions; financial position; the quality of nutrition. To factors of the disease onset were attributed: age debut; factors that preceded the first episode; syndromes of the first episode; the first reference to a psychiatrist; suicidal statements and intentions. Results. It was evaluated the prognostic significance of individual predisposing factors to depression in patients with paranoid schizophrenia and found the following factors of predisposition (p< 0. 05) : the heredity of schizophrenia and affective disorders; low level of erudition, combined with <b>emotional</b> and volitional <b>immaturity,</b> anxiety, prone to mood swings; low income and the cost of food, clothing and leisure; poor living conditions; unstable or conflictual family relationships; the presence of the first episode of affective symptoms, such as depressive, which is stored in the further course of the disease, as well as anhedonia, sleep and appetite disorders, weight loss; statements of suicidal thoughts or intentions for life. Age and factors that preceded the disease onset had no statistically significant effect on the development of depressive symptoms in this group of patients. Conclusions. The revealed features allow improving the quality of depressive symptoms diagnosis in patients with paranoid schizophrenia, and the development of their medical and social rehabilitation measures complex based on identified features. It will enhance both the results of treatment and the level of social functioning and life quality of this patients group...|$|R

Weak-willed as she is, she spends much of her life caught in an emotional tug of war between Patsy, her lifelong friend and corrupter, and Saffy (Saffron), her sensible goody-two-shoes daughter. Despite their frequent verbal sparring, Edina and Saffy often show genuine concern and affection for one another. Edina sometimes comforts Saffy without needing to, once remarking [...] "I do sort-of love you" [...] and punching Saffron's teacher in the face after deceitfully trying to seduce her, even though he was a married man with children. Edina often shows a deep need to make her daughter proud of her.

5000|$|Pedro II {{had grown}} and matured by 1843. He was {{considered}} a handsome man, at 1.90 m (6'3") tall with blue eyes and blond hair. He had, however, two physical flaws: a protunding jaw (inherited from his Habsburg mother's family, and which in the later 1840s {{he would try to}} conceal by letting his beard grow), and a high-pitched, childish voice. The [...] "single complaint about Pedro II's behavior as monarch was his lack of social graces, and in particular his taciturnity. Since he rarely volunteered more than a word or two, maintaining a direct conversation with him was next to impossible." [...] That, coupled with <b>emotional</b> <b>immaturity,</b> made ministers of State and courtiers expect that he would improve his behavior and character once he had married.

The Brazilian Imperial Family was then reduced to only three people, Pedro II and his sisters Francisca and Januária (Paula had died in 1833 from meningitis at age 9). Januária was the heiress presumptive to the throne and held the title of Princess Imperial, while Francisca was second (and last) in the line of succession.The problem was that Pedro II, although born of one of the most illustrious royal lineages, {{was considered a}} poor marital prospect according to standards of European royalty. This was because Brazil was then a country without much political and economic importance in the international arena. The Brazilian government hoped to arrange matches with members of the House of Habsburg> and asked Ferdinand I, Emperor of Austria and uncle of Pedro II, to assist in this. However, Ferdinand was mentally handicapped and Prince von Metternich was the power behind Austria's throne. Metternich was not at all interested in collaborating with the Brazilian Empire. The reason was a deep resentment he held against Pedro I (Pedro II's father). In 1834 the liberal and constitutionalist Pedro I defeated and dethroned his absolutist brother Miguel I, who was supported by the reactionary Metternich.|$|E
