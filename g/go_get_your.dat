He said the song is [...] "infectious, deliciously dark ('Well <b>go</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> shovel, and we'll dig a deep hole'), and packed with more energy than a Jedward dance routine - Williams sounds downright tremendous leading the 'ba-ba-ba' climax - this should provide a welcome edge at the top end of the charts". Rolling Stone stated that [...] "Brick by Boring Brick" [...] was able to [...] "weave unexpected Smashing Pumpkins-style sonics into the mix." [...] The song received a positive review from Vicki Lutas of the BBC, who awarded the song 5 out of 5 stars. She said that the song is [...] "hair-raisingly BRILLIANT" [...] and said [...] "Listening to the lyrics is like entering a world where sandcastles aren't built, but buried, {{a world where the}} baddie is not the wolf, but reality... and in this world, things are dark, but they're very real. There's a sense of longing; longing for those fairy tales and longing for innocence, but it's coupled with a sense of realization that this will never happen." ...|$|E
5000|$|In Sainkheda, a {{very worried}} lady once came to Dadaji. She {{told him that}} she has to get her {{daughter}} married but cannot afford it as she is very poor. Dadaji told her that he will come to her house in the morning. Next day, early in the morning, Dadaji came to her house and when she greeted him, he said to her 'move aside, I want to pass stool'. He went to her kitchen, sat on her 'chula' (stove) and passed stool there. He then got up, told her to cover his stool with ash and left her house without saying anything. The lady's husband chided and scolded her for this, saying that what kind of Guru she has, of all the places why did he come to their kitchen and pass stool. Angrily he told her to throw out the stool and clean their 'chula'. When she picked up the ash covered stool she felt it to be a lot heavier than expected. But she still went ahead and threw it outside. When it fell on the ground and the ash blew off it they noticed that it had turned to gold! They picked it up, washed it, put it in a plate and took it to Dadaji. From a distance Dadaji started saying to her [...] "why are you showing it to me, <b>go</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> daughter married". When the woman and her husband came closer to Dadaji, he said [...] "don't you understand? I have done this to get your daughter married." [...] The woman went home and sold a part of that gold to fund her daughter's marriage and made jewellery from the remaining gold. Even today the descendants of the woman who got married, have the jewellery which was made of Dadaji's stool that had turned to gold.|$|E

5000|$|The movie {{received}} a positive to mixed reception from critics. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the movie 4 stars out of 5, saying that [...] "On the whole, Love Aaj Kal {{is for the}} young and romantic at heart. Sure, it's not perfect, but the terrific performances, melodious music and stirring emotional moments more than compensate for the hiccups." [...] Nikhat Kazmi of Times of India gave the movie 4 stars in a scale of 5, concluding that [...] "Go watch it for its GenNow feel and its ekdum modern appeal." [...] Sonia Chopra of Sify gave the movie 3.5 stars out of 5, commenting that [...] "With lilting music and characters you'll love, Imtiaz Ali brings {{out one of the}} most romantic films in recent times. It's a love story of the aam junta, with a delicious contemporary edge. <b>Go</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> fill." [...] Shubhra Gupta of Indian Express gave the movie 3 stars in a scale of 5, noting that [...] "It's hard not to warm up to a film which is, at its core, likeable. I just wish I could have liked it more." [...] Aniruddha Guha of DNA India gave the movie 3 stars out of 5, writing that [...] "Though Love Aaj Kal may not quite be the film you expect it to be, it does not leave you feeling disappointed either. Watch it without too many expectations and you will come back smiling. And if you have wanted to ask someone out for a while, this film is the perfect ice-breaker." [...] Raja Sen of Rediff gave the movie 2.5 stars in a scale of 5, stating that [...] "Love Aaj Kal is a harmless, watchable film - sad, because it could have been truly special. It has its moments in the first half, while the second half is an over-melodramatic drag." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the movie 2 stars out of 5, pointing that [...] "The film in the end is ordinary stuff, watchable but never memorable like the director's previous efforts, the far superior Socha Na Tha and Jab We Met. I'm going with two out of five and an average rating for Love Aaj Kal. It's like that plump mango you bite into only to discover it's not ripe yet. Watch it nevertheless for the sharp dialogue and some clever humor." ...|$|E
40|$|What is a {{conversation}} like between a handbag and a scarf? How can you mediate their conversation and when is your skirt allowed {{in on the}} discussion? As a woman is about to leave her house, her handbag may solicit the weather forecast from the humidity sensor on its fellow smart curtain. It might deliver the news of an impending downpour by saying ‘I think it might rain. <b>Go</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> umbrella. ” And after deliberating with her coat pocket, the handbag may use ambient light to caution the user if she’s forgotten her cell phone. This work presents a prototype network embedded in fabric that allows, for example, sensors in a scarf to communicate with a handbag and vice versa. Novel materials and technology are integrated into a set of fabric blocks that can be configured into familiar garments and accessories that borrow and share sensory data. The system is designed to afford anyone the ability to build, rip apart and reconfigure intelligent objects. Because the use...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{starts with}} the {{proposition}} that most American contracting is consumer contracting, posits that consumer contracting has particular and even peculiar doctrinal features, and concludes that these features dominate the lay understanding of contract law. Contracts of adhesion constitute the bulk of consumer experience with contract law. It {{is not hard to}} see that someone discerning the nature of contract law from a sample composed almost entirely of boilerplate terms and conditions would come quickly to the conclusion that contract law is highly formal. Within the realm of potentially enforceable deals (i. e., those that are supported by consideration and not illegal or unconscionable), modern contract doctrine upholds agreements when the parties have objectively manifested assent. This is the contract law of the first‐year Contracts course, and it is, more or less, why contracts existed in the cases Hadley v. Baxendale, Hawkins v. McGee, and Embry v. Hargadine, McKittrick Dry Goods Co. These three canonical cases each involve oral manifestations of assent: respectively, the contracts are based on the carrier 2 ̆ 7 s promise that the crankshaft would be delivered by noon the next day; the doctor 2 ̆ 7 s promise of a one‐hundred percent good hand; and the employer 2 ̆ 7 s response to his anxious employee, “You 2 ̆ 7 re alright. <b>Go</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> men out. ” For everyone who knows the doctrine of assent, these are relatively easy cases for finding contracts, because the evidence suggests that the parties, in fact, communicated to each other their agreement. However, these cases might startle {{a large percentage of the}} nonattorney population, for the simple reason that they are oral and not written contracts. What accounts for this misperception of contract law? Americans are not contract naïfs. On the contrary, most people enter into numerous legally binding agreements every year, if not every month or week. These are the agreements we make with Amazon, PayPal, Comcast, Apple, AT 2 ̆ 6 T, and Visa, to name a few—in other words, these are the contracts we enter into regularly as consumers. Consumer contracts share key features: they are formal, assent is memorialized (either by signature or by clicking “I agree”), parties neither negotiate nor read their terms, and they are almost universally enforceable and, when litigated, enforced. This is the contract law that individuals encounter every day. As such, perhaps we should not be surprised that this is what most people think that contract law is. Emerging evidence indicates that most people think contracting means signing the paperwork and that contract law is about the form of consent rather than the content to which parties are consenting. This “intuitive formalism” deserves our empirical and normative attention because it has real implications for how consumers behave in their deals and how they interact with their legal system...|$|E
