50|$|Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man, the {{archetype}} of black existentialist literature, {{is one of}} the most revered and reviewed novels written by an African-American writer. It presents examples of absurdism, anxiety and alienation in relation to the experience of the black male in mid-1900s America. The namelessness of the main character of the novel, a figure based on Ellison's own life, points to the trauma of black people receiving names that were forced on them from the violence of slavery. That renaming was meant to inaugurate a loss of memory, and that process of dismemberment is explored in the novel as the protagonist moves from one abusive father figure to another—white and black—to a culminating reflection on living as an invisible leech off of the system that produces light. In Ellison's novel, the only black characters who seemed somewhat free were those designated insane, as in the famous scene at the Golden <b>Day</b> <b>bar</b> where a group from an insane asylum became the critical voice early in the novel.|$|E
5000|$|Carl Bär {{published}} {{a paper in}} 1963 that came down in favour of Mozart's authorship, noting that a passage in Joachim von Schiedenhofen's diary for 25 July 1777 stated that a Mozart symphony, a violin concerto (played by Mozart), and a flute concerto were rehearsed at Gusset's. Bär believed that the violin concerto was K. 271a/271i, and also identified this with the violin concerto Leopold referred to as [...] "the concerto you Wolfgang wrote for Kolb" [...] on 3 August 1778. He ruled out the five certainly authentic violin concerti as possibilities, as they were written in 1775, and Leopold had stated on 13 August 1778 in a letter that Count Czernin (who had been in Salzburg since April 1775) had never heard the violin being played by Kolb. Kolb was originally thought to be Franz Xavier Kolb (1731-82), but Bär suspected it to actually have been his older son Johann Andreas (born in 1746-8?). Bär hypothesized {{that he had been}} given the concerto by Mozart just before leaving Salzburg, thus dating the concerto to between 16 June (performance of the second Lodron Nachtmusik, K. 287/271H) and 26 July 1777 (Nannerl's name <b>day).</b> <b>Bär</b> also believed the dating of the manuscript ("Salisburgo li 16 di Luglio 1777") to be another point in favour of the work's authenticity, as it was in a similar form to those on most contemporary autographs and was in a time that the author of the heading would not have known a violin concerto had probably been written. But Ernest Hess noted that the work had compositional errors, un-Mozartian phrases, weaknesses in instrumentation, and sequences without meaning that Mozart himself had parodied in his A Musical Joke, K. 522, all speaking against Mozart being the author of this concerto. The sixth edition of the Köchel catalogue kept the work as K. 271i, copying the third edition's remarks, but referencing Hess' doubts as to its authenticity.|$|E
40|$|For {{single-layer}} barrier coatings, {{the influence}} of coating defects of thin SiO x coatings on the barrier properties was investigated. Coating defects only originate from the coating process; they seem to form independently from the surface roughness of the substrate. The coatings were deposited in a roll-to-roll process (width 1 m) by using the plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition technique. The SiO x coatings, applied in this work, have thicknesses {{in the range of}} 30 – 50 [*]nm with a carbon content of less than 1 at-%. They show an oxygen transmission rate of 1 · 3 [*]±[*] 0 · 4 [*]cm 3 /(m 2 <b>day</b> <b>bar)</b> at best. The focus of this research is to investigate {{the influence of}} plasma pressure on the coating defects and therefore to the barrier properties. In order to identify nanosized coating defects inside the coating, the Maxwell-Garnett theory was used. The defect volume was indirectly calculated with the help of ellipsometric measurement data. The Maxwell-Garnett theory is a very fast method to investigate the quality of barrier coatings...|$|E
