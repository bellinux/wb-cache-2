In those {{interesting}} and popular treatises {{on the art}} of drawing, which tell the public that their colors should neither be too warm nor too cold, and that their touches should always be characteristic of the object they are intended to represent, the directions given for the manufacture of stones usually enforce [...] "crispness of outline" [...] and [...] "roughness of texture." [...] And, accordingly, in certain expressions of <b>frangibility,</b> irregular accumulation, and easy resting of one block upon another, together with some conditions of lichenous or mossy texture, modern stone-painting is far beyond the ancient; for these are just the characters which first strike the eye, and enable the foreground to maintain its picturesque influence, without inviting careful examination. The mediæval painter, on the other hand, not caring for this picturesque general effect, nor being in anywise familiar with mountain scenery, perceived in stones, when he was forced to paint them, eminently the characters which they had in common with figures; that is to say, their curved outlines, rounded surfaces, and varieties of delicate color, and, accordingly, was somewhat too apt to lose their angular and fragmentary character in a series of muscular lines resembling those of an anatomical preparation; for, although in large rocks the cleavable or frangible nature was the thing that necessarily struck him most, the pebbles under his feet were apt to be oval or rounded in the localities of almost all the important schools of Italy. In Lombardy, the mass of the ground is composed of nothing but Alpine gravel, consisting of rolled oval pebbles, on the average about six inches long by four wide--awkward building materials, yet used in ingenious alternation with the bricks in all the lowland Italian fortresses. Besides this universal rotundity, the qualities of stones which rendered them valuable to the lapidary were forced on the painter's attention by the familiar arts of inlaying and mosaic. Hence, in looking at a pebble, his mind was divided between its roundness and its veins; and Leonardo covers the shelves of rock under the feet of St. Anne with variegated agates; while Mantegna often strews the small stones about his mountain caves in a polished profusion, as if some repentant martyr princess had been just scattering her caskets of pearls into the dust.|$|E

Misfolded protein can form ordered protein aggregates, amyloids, which {{are associated with a}} host of neurodegenerative diseases in mammals and control heritable traits in fungi and yeast. Industrially, amorphous aggregates reduce the efficacy of protein-based therapeutics and activity of enzymes during production and storage. This work studies ion-specific and solvent-based effects on protein physical stability. We show that ion-specificity significantly affects amyloid formation kinetics, aggregate morphology, thermostability, <b>frangibility,</b> and, most intriguingly, prion infectivity in vivo. Forming amyloid in chaotropic or kosmotropic solutions generates predominately weak or strong prion variants, respectively. Ion-specific effects also influenced amorphous aggregation of model proteins and antibodies. To quantify protein - protein stability/affinity, we developed a rapid and reliable diffusion-based technique. Our technique was able to resolve relative differences in colloidal stability between various saline and saccharide solutions.

Some of these, such as the {{approach}} lighting system are positioned {{in such a way as}} to present a hazard to aircraft safety. The support structure of the approach lighting system are required to be frangible. The <b>frangibility</b> of a mast determines through a full-scale dynamical crash-test, where the masts deformation sequence, max impact force and energy are direct measures on its <b>frangibility.</b> Today s standard recommends the use of a rigid impactor to represent the wing section of a small aircraft. Simulations show however that the rigid impactor generates initial reaction forces far above the ICAO rules. The rigid impactor is still used due low production and test cost related to it. The current version of a deformable impactor is a true copy of the wing section of a small aircraft. This makes it complex and expensive to manufacture. The main objective of this thesis is therefore to develop an alternative low-cost deformable impactor for future crash-tests. Through studying test results from previous quasi-static compression tests of the current standard wing impactor, I define and describe a characteristic dynamic force-response in which the new impactor must mimic. Several concepts has been evaluated, where a simplification of the current soft wing impactor showed to provide the best solution with respect to both dynamic response and cost. A detailed version of the concept has been proposed. To test the chosen products dynamical responses, a quasi-statical compression test and a dynamical compression test has been performed in ABAQUS. The impactor was compressed using a rigid intruder with a representative cross-section of a typical aviation mast. The quasi-static compression test was performed with an intruder speed of 50 mm/min and the dynamical with an intruder speed of 140 km/h. A bi-linear material model and a non-linear material model was chosen to investigate the effects of strain hardening on the post-yielding behavior. The results from the quasi-static compression tests showed promising results with regards to deformation modes, but the strength of the impactor was a little low. This could be increased by small alteration of geometry. The model showed to be sensitive to strain hardening, which had a negative effect and altered deformation modes slightly. The dynamical compression test showed to be in very good relation to the current soft wing impactor, both in deformation modes and recorded force levels. The model was not sensitive to strain hardening in the dynamical analysis. These results must however be considered only as an indication on the impactors properties, as a there are great uncertainties related to the material modelling used. Optimization of the concept and further testing and validation is necessary before this product can be put to use...|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{imminent}} danger of colliding into aviation aids located with {{close proximity to}} runways or taxiways, ICAO {{was in the early}} 80 s specifically assigned to develop specifications for frangible lighting structures. As a result, the ICAO Frangible Aids Study Group (FASG) was established in 1981 to subsequently propose design specifications and crash test procedures regarding <b>frangibility</b> of aviation aids and supporting masts. Two specific types of impactors were used for testing and development of aviation lighting structures. These two types were rigid and soft impactors. However, during multiple tests conducted the last decades, the rigid impactor was soon discovered to generate initial peak forces far above the limit of 45 kN stated by ICAO FASG. It was also impossible to analyse structural damage since National Aerospace Laboratory (NLR), Netherlands, stated that the pass/fail criteria considering <b>frangibility</b> of an ALS must be based on damage applied to the wing. Damage to the skin was accepted, but damage to supporting wing-structures like the front spar was unacceptable. The rigid impactor is still used based on arguments such as inexpensiveness of production and the simple and reusable construction. However, FASG soon stated that only soft-impactors allowed for damage identification and was therefore the correct choice during testing of aviation masts. In this master project, the assigned students have been tasked to document, benchmark and qualify a standard Soft-Wing-Impactor (SWI) based on the proposed design by NLR. In total, four soft wing impactors are built and tested by conducting quasi-static compressions tests. The tests are conducted in accordance with the test procedure specified by NLR and supervisor Rølvåg. The results from testing are compared to criteria specified by ICAO. The main concern considering the validation of a SWI was that supporting aviation structures must not impose peak forces and energy to an aircraft wing higher than 45 kN and 55 kJ. Test results are also compared to a virtual test carried out by Rølvåg, and to physical compression tests carried out by Wiggenraad et. al. These are used as references in our discussions regarding the test results. Tensile and shear tests of the aluminum 2024 -T 3 and rivets were also conducted to verify mechanical properties. The results and results from the physical compression tests are intended for further calibration of the virtual model in Abaqus. The results proved that the SWI s were sensitive to large shear-stress in the transition between the skin and the tip of the nose-ribs. This happened to all SWI s since the test procedure specified to place the intruder in between the two centre nose-ribs. Test 1 and 2 yielded low peak forces due to rivets with low shear and tensile strength. The force reached 43 and 37 kN before the main-spar was detached from the supporting ribstructure. Based on these results, test 3 and 4 were substituted with stronger rivets which yielded sufficient shear and tensile strength based on tests carried out on the rivets. Test 3 and 4 resulted in a peak force of 47 and 55 kN. According to the ICAO limit of 45 kN, these were considered sufficient. Test 4 was the most reliable and sustainable impactor and can be used in future tests of aviation masts based on the margin of 10 kN...|$|E

Every method has its strengths and weaknesses. For example, ME method is the first reported technique for obtaining layered structure MoS 2. However, this method has the disadvantages of poor scalability and low yield, hindering the large-scale applications. To overcome the defects of ME method, CVD offers a controllable approach {{for the production of}} single and few-layer MoS 2. While for the MoS 2 growth, it is often necessary to pretreat of the substrate. PLD and MSD should be the ideal methods for growing high-quality MoS 2 film directly with different sizes and areas, but with many crystal defects. The reported technology for incorporating MoS 2 into fiber lasers can be mainly divided into two methods: (1) directly sandwiching the MoS 2 -based SAs between two fiber connectors by mixing the MoS 2 nanomaterials into polymer film and (2) depositing the MoS 2 nanomaterials on tapered fiber or D-shaped fiber by using the evanescent wave interaction. The sandwich-type MoS 2 optical modulators have the advantages of flexibility and convenience. It also has the weak point of low thermal damage. The evanescent wave method can enhance the damage threshold of SAs, but it has the shortcoming of <b>frangibility.</b> For practical applications, tapered fiber or D-shaped fiber-based optical modulators need to be packaged, which makes the fabrication procedure very complicated. Therefore, establishing fine-controlled MoS 2 nanomaterial still require deeper exploring, and improving effective fabrication method is still a longstanding goal.|$|E

Here we analyze the role of a tyrosine residue (Y 169) which is strictly conserved in mammalian PrPs. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy studies of many mammalian PrP(C) proteins have provided evidence of a conformational equilibrium between a 310 -helical turn and a type I β turn conformation in the β 2 -α 2 loop (residues 165 - 175). In vitro cell-free experiments of the seeded conversion of PrP(C) indicate that non-aromatic residues at position 169 reduce the formation of proteinase K-resistant PrP. Recent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of monomeric PrP and several single-point mutants show that Y 169 stabilizes the 310 -helical turn conformation more than single-point mutants at position 169 or residues in contact with it. In the 310 -helical turn conformation the hydrophobic and aggregation-prone segment 169 -YSNQNNF- 175 is buried and thus not-available for self-assembly. From the combined analysis of simulation and experimental results it emerges that Y 169 is an aggregation gatekeeper with a twofold role. Mutations related to 3 human prion diseases are interpreted {{on the basis of the}} gatekeeper role in the monomeric state. Another potential role of the Y 169 side chain is the stabilization of the ordered aggregates, i. e., reduction of <b>frangibility</b> of filamentous protofibrils and fibrils, which is likely to reduce the generation of toxic species...|$|E
