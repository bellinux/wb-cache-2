50|$|The {{first attempt}} to {{establish}} the record was flown on July 10, 1923. Maughan took off from Mitchel Field, Long Island, at 4:56 a.m. The Allegheny Mountains were obscured by a thick undercast, and unable to navigate by landmarks, Maughan flew by dead reckoning, arriving at McCook Field 90 minutes behind schedule, where a broken tail <b>fin</b> <b>rib</b> caused an additional delay. The engine of the PW-8 quit in flight over Illinois because of a clogged fuel line, and Maughan made a forced landing in a farm field, damaging the landing gear and ending the attempt.|$|E
30|$|Many {{types of}} heat exchangers, {{shell and tube}} heat exchanger, fin and tube heat exchanger, plate fin heat exchanger, etc., are used in various {{industries}} such as heat treatment process, chemical industry, power plant, automotive industry, food industry, etc. The heat exchangers had been improved with the main aims to augment the thermal performance and {{to reduce the size}} of the heat exchanger. The improvement techniques of the heat exchanger are divided into two types: active and passive techniques. The thermal performance improvement with the passive method is widely used more than the active mode due to it does not require the additional power into the heating system. The passive method is to use the turbulator or vortex generator such as <b>fin,</b> <b>rib,</b> baffle, wing, winglet, and roughness surface to generate the vortex flow or swirling flow in the heat exchanger that helps to increase the heat transfer rate and performance. The selection of the turbulator depends on the application of the heat exchanger. The roughness tube is a popular type of the vortex generator, which always use to enhance heat transfer rate and performance, due to it gives lower friction loss than the other types of the turbulators.|$|E

5000|$|Brenneke and Foster type slugs {{have the}} same basic {{configuration}} as normal slugs, but have increased accuracy. The hollowed rear of the Foster slug improves accuracy by placing more mass {{in the front of}} the projectile, therefore inhibiting the [...] "tumble" [...] that normal slugs may generate. The Brenneke slug takes this concept a bit further, with the addition of a wad that stays connected to the projectile after discharge, increasing accuracy. Both slugs are commonly found with <b>fins</b> or <b>rib,</b> which are meant to allow the projectile to safely squeeze down during passage through chokes, but they do not increase stability in flight.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{available}} options for enhancing heat transfer. The enhancement {{can be achieved}} by increasing the surface area for convection or/and increasing the convection coefficient. For example, the surface roughness can be used to increase [...] in order to enhance turbulence. This can be achieved through machining or other kinds of insertions like coil-spring wire. The insert provides a helical roughness in contact with the surface. The convection coefficient may also be increased by an insert of a twisted tape that consists in a periodical twist through 360 degrees. Tangential inserts optimize the velocity of the flow near the tube wall, while providing a bigger heat transfer area.

Protobramidae are small deep-bodied marine teleosts from the Lower Cenomanian of Lebanon. They are characterised by the gomphosis of the neural and haemal arches on the centra all along the axial skeleton, the loss of segmentation on the dorsal and anal fin rays, the small cycloid scales covering {{the basis of the}} unpaired <b>fins,</b> the <b>ribs</b> fused with the haemapophyses, the loss of epicentrals and epipleurals, the loss of epurals, the reduced number (4 or 5) of hypurals and the fusion of hypurals 3 and 4 into a dorsal hypural plate. The skull is medio-parietal. The temporal fossa is dorsally bordered by the parietal. The jaws are feebly toothed or toothless. The maxillary, which is bordering the mouth, is always toothless. The supramaxillaries are lost. The possible synonymy of the Protobramidae and Plethodidae (or Tselfatiidae) as well as the integration of the Protobramidae, the Araripichthyidae and the Ferrifronsidae into a suborder of the Protobramoidei are discussed and rejected.

50|$|Least puffers are tetraodontids, meaning {{their teeth}} have fused into beaks {{with a median}} {{division}} that produces two plates in {{the upper and lower}} jaw. Tetraodontids can also be characterized by their lack of <b>fin</b> spines or <b>ribs,</b> and a tough skin that is often covered with small spinulous scales. They typically have dorsal fins containing 8-9 rays and their pectoral rays are usually within the number range of 13-16. Sphoeroides parvus have a caudal fin that can be dusky or plain and they lack pelvic fins entirely. No predominant dark spot is found in axil of the pectoral fin, with the fin's meristics being 13-16 rays. The dorsal side of S. parvus is brownish gray, while a white coloration dominates the venter. There is a ventrolateral row of black blotches, being irregular in size and arrangenment, separating the dorsal and ventral colorations. The body has color irregularities of light and dark on the sides and back. A least puffer body is elongate and globular, with their sides often having a golden hue. The interorbital width is typically 25% or more of snout length.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Heat {{transfer}} augmentation techniques (passive, active or {{a combination}} of passive and active methods) are commonly used in areas such as process industries, heating and cooling in evaporators, thermal power plants, air-conditioning equipment, refrigerators, radiators for space vehicles, automobiles, etc. Passive techniques, where inserts are used in the flow passage to augment the heat transfer rate, are advantageous compared with active techniques, because the insert manufacturing process is simple and these techniques can be easily employed in an existing heat exchanger. In design of compact heat exchangers, passive techniques of heat transfer augmentation can play an important role if a proper passive insert configuration can be selected according to the heat exchanger working condition (both flow and heat transfer conditions). In the past decade, several studies on the passive techniques of heat transfer augmentation have been reported. Twisted tapes, wire coils, <b>ribs,</b> <b>fins,</b> dimples, etc., are the most commonly used passive heat transfer augmentation tools. In the present paper, emphasis is given to works dealing with different shapes of ribs, and there arrangement because, according to recent studies, these are known to be economic heat transfer augmentation tools.

40|$|Presented in {{this study}} is a {{mathematical}} model and preliminary experimental results of a <b>ribbed</b> caudal <b>fin</b> to be used in an aquatic robot. The ribbed caudal tail is comprised of two thin beams separated by ribbed sectionals as it tapers towards the fin. By oscillating the <b>ribbed</b> caudal <b>fin,</b> the aquatic robot can achieve forward propulsion and maneuver around its environment. The fully enclosed system allows for the aquatic robot to have very little effect on marine life and fully blend into its respective environment. Because of these advantages, there are many applications including surveillance, sensing, and detection. Because the caudal fin actuator has very thin side walls, Kirchhoff-Love’s large deformation beam theory is applicable for the large deformation of the fish-fin actuator. In the model, it is critical to accurately model the curvature of beams. To this end, ! beam elements for thin beams are developed by specializing the shear- deformable beam elements, [19], based upon Reissner’s shear-deformable nonlinear beam model. Furthermore, preliminary experiments on the <b>ribbed</b> <b>fin</b> are presented to supplement the FE model. Uses for underwater robots are widespread, impacting many engineering and commercial sectors. To achieve maximum maneuverability, several means of propulsion have been discussed and implemented in existing robots. Presented in this research is an alternative method of generating propulsion through the use of gyroscopes. Gyroscopes have been widely known as a means of stabilization or attitude control. In the work presented, a gyroscopically driven robot design is shown and validated through experiments. The robot was shown to swim along a straight path and perform both left and right 90 and 180 degree turns, allowing it to successfully maneuver along the water surface plane...|$|R

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} coefficients in {{the cooling}} cavities of turbine airfoils are greatly {{enhanced by the}} presence of discrete ribs on the cavity walls. These ribs introduce two heat transfer enhancing features: a significant increase in heat transfer coefficient by promoting turbulence and mixing, and an increase in heat transfer area. Considerable amount of data are reported in open literature for the heat transfer coefficients both on the rib surface and on the floor area between the ribs. Many airfoil cooling design software tools, however, require an overall average heat transfer coefficient on a rib-roughened wall. Dealing with a complex flow circuit in conjunction with 180 ∘ bends, numerous film holes, trailing-edge slots, tip bleeds, crossover impingement, and a conjugate heat transfer problem; these tools are not often able to handle the geometric details of the rib-roughened surfaces or local variations in heat transfer coefficient on a rib-roughened wall. On the other hand, assigning an overall area-weighted average heat transfer coefficient based on the rib and floor area and their corresponding heat transfer coefficients will have the inherent error of assuming a 100 % fin efficiency for the ribs, that is, assuming that rib surface temperature {{is the same as the}} rib base temperature. Depending on the rib geometry, this error could produce an overestimation of up to 10 % in the evaluated rib-roughened wall heat transfer coefficient. In this paper, a correction factor is developed that can be applied to the overall area-weighted average heat transfer coefficient that, when applied to the projected rib-roughened cooling cavity walls, the net heat removal from the airfoil is the same as that of the rib-roughened wall. To develop this correction factor, the experimental results of heat transfer coefficients on the rib and on the surface area between the ribs are combined with about 400 numerical conduction models to determine an overall equivalent heat transfer coefficient that can be used in airfoil cooling design software. A well-known group method of data handling (GMDH) scheme was then utilized to develop a correlation that encompasses most pertinent parameters including the <b>rib</b> geometry, <b>rib</b> <b>fin</b> efficiency, and the rib and floor heat transfer coefficients...|$|R
40|$|Efficient and {{effective}} cooling of the trailing edges of gas-turbine vanes and blades is challenging {{because there is}} very little space to work with. In this study, CFD simulations based on steady RANS closed by the shear-stress transport turbulence model were performed to study the flow and heat transfer in an L-shaped duct for the trailing edge under two operating conditions. One operating condition, referred to as the laboratory condition, where experimental measurements were made, has a Reynolds number at the duct inlet of ReD = 15, 000, coolant inlet temperature of Tinlet = 300 K, wall temperature of Twall = 335 K, a back pressure of Pb = 1 atm. When rotating, the angular speed was Ω = 1, 000 rpm. The other condition, referred to as the engine-relevant condition, has Re D = 150, 000 at the duct inlet, Tinlet = 673 K, Twall = 1, 173 K, and Pb = 25 atm. When rotating, Ω was 3, 600 rpm. ^ The objective is {{to understand the nature of}} the flow and heat transfer in an L-shaped cooling passage for the trailing edge that has a combination of <b>ribs</b> and pin <b>fins</b> under rotating and non-rotating conditions with focus on how pin <b>fins</b> and <b>ribs</b> distribute the flow throughout the passage and to understand what features of the flow and heat transfer can or cannot be extrapolated from the laboratory to the engine-relevant operating conditions. ^ When there is no rotation, results obtained show that for both operating conditions, the pin fins minimized the size of the separation bubble when the flow exits the inlet duct into the expanded portion of the L-shaped duct. The size of the separation bubble at the tip of the L-shaped duct created by the adverse pressure gradient is quite large for the laboratory condition and relatively small for the engine condition. Each rib was found to create two sets of recirculating flows, one just upstream of the rib because of the adverse pressure gradient induced by the rib and one just downstream of the rib because of flow separation from a sharp edge. These recirculating flows spiral from the ribs towards the exit of the L-shaped duct, and the spiraling brings cool fluid from the middle of the passage to the walls. Each pin fin was found to induce a pair of counter-rotating separated regions behind it and has horse-shoe vortices that wrap around it next to the top and bottom walls. The heat transfer is highest just upstream of the each rib, around the pin fins, and when the cooling fluid impinges on walls, and very low in the separated region next to the tip. ^ When there is rotation, Coriolis force creates a pair of counter-rotating vortices that bring the cooler fluid to the trailing wall in the inlet duct. Thus, the trailing wall has higher heat transfer than the leading wall. In the inlet duct, centrifugal buoyancy causes a massive flow separation on the leading wall. In the expanded portion of the L-shaped duct, the centrifugal-buoyancy-induced separation on the leading wall is limited to the region with the ribs, and the separation degenerates into a series of smaller spiraling separation bubbles, one between every set of consecutive ribs. On the leading and trailing walls, the ribs and the pin fins induce the same kind of flows as they did under non-rotating conditions. ^ Because of centrifugal-buoyancy-induced flow separation on the leading face, the heat transfer on the leading wall is 10 - 15 % lower than that on the trailing wall, which is not significant. The adverse effects of centrifugal buoyancy were mitigated because the separation bubbles between the ribs are spiraling from the side wall to the trailing-edge exit and are constantly supplied by new coolant. The heat transfer on the side and back walls is higher near the trailing wall because centrifugal buoyancy directed most of the coolant flow towards the trailing wall. The size of the separation bubble at the tip of the L-shaped duct essentially disappeared when there is rotation for both the lab and engine-relevant conditions. ...|$|R
