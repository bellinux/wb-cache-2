40|$|Based on {{the data}} of a recent study, the paper will show and analyse the factors that {{contribute}} to the fast <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> energy <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> ICT end-user devices over the past years. The main purpose of the paper is to outline future developments and challenges with respect to the further <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> energy <b>efficiency</b> in the field of end-user devices. In the paper the authors will argue that further improvement is strongly related to the user's capability to select the right product in terms of functional configuration for their individual use. Some possible solutions supporting the user will be discussed ranging from technical means such as advanced software solutions to the investigation of additional regulative requirements. Finally, the paper will investigate the economics <b>of</b> the remaining <b>improvement</b> potential.

50|$|In conclusion, {{the use of}} {{the mobile}} phone {{technology}} (in combination with a web-based interface) in health care results in an increase in convenience and efficiency of data collection, transfer, storage and analysis management of data as compared with paper-based systems. Formal studies and preliminary project assessments demonstrate this <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>efficiency</b> of healthcare delivery by mobile technology. Nevertheless, mHealth should not be considered as a panacea for healthcare. Possible organizational issues include the ensuring of appropriate use and proper care of the handset, lost or stolen phones, and the important consideration of costs related to the purchase of equipment. There is therefore a difficulty in comparison in weighing up mHealth interventions against other priority and evidence-based interventions.|$|E
