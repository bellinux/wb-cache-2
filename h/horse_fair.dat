5|$|Almost {{no records}} survive of the Norman {{market in the}} 11th to 13thcenturies. It is known that shortly after the market's establishment, a tollhouse was built nearby, which served as a {{collection}} point for taxes on trade. Although the precise location of the tollhouse is not recorded, it was immediately north of the market on part of the site now occupied by the Guildhall. At some point soon after its construction, the tollhouse also became the centre for the civil administration of the city. Although the Tombland market retained its charter to host an annual <b>horse</b> <b>fair,</b> over time the market at Mancroft supplanted that at Tombland as the principal market of the area. At {{the end of the}} 11thcentury, the Tombland market was removed during construction work on Norwich Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{their ancient}} history, all living Andalusians trace {{to a small}} number of horses bred by {{religious}} orders in the 18th and 19thcenturies. An influx of heavy horse blood beginning in the 16th century, resulted in the dilution of many of the bloodlines; only those protected by selective breeding remained intact to become the modern Andalusian. During the 19th century, the Andalusian breed was threatened because many horses were stolen or requisitioned in wartime, including the War of the Oranges, the Peninsular War and the three Carlist Wars. Napoleon's invading army also stole many horses. One herd of Andalusians was hidden from the invaders however, and subsequently used to renew the breed. In 1822, breeders began to add Norman blood into Spanish bloodlines, as well as further infusions of Arabian blood. This was partially because increasing mechanization and changing needs within the military called for horses with more speed in cavalry charges as well as horses with more bulk for pulling gun carriages. In 1832, an epidemic seriously affected Spain's horse population, from which only one small herd survived in a stud at the monastery in Cartuja. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, European breeders, especially the Germans, changed from an emphasis on Andalusian and Neapolitan horses (an emphasis that had been in place since the decline of chivalry), to an emphasis on the breeding of Thoroughbreds and warmbloods, further depleting the stock of Andalusians. Despite this change in focus, Andalusian breeding slowly recovered, and in 1869, the Seville <b>Horse</b> <b>Fair</b> (originally begun by the Romans), played host to between ten and twelve thousand Spanish horses. In the early 20th century, Spanish horse breeding began to focus on other breeds, particularly draft breeds, Arabians, Thoroughbreds and crosses between these breeds, as well as crosses between these breeds and the Andalusian. The purebred Andalusian was not viewed favorably by breeders or the military, and their numbers decreased significantly.|$|E

Such percentages for more valuable non-ferrous metals may be significantly greater.|$|E

500|$|Mérens {{horses were}} {{sold at the}} Tarascon-sur-Ariege <b>horse</b> <b>fair,</b> and were popular with merchants from the large cities. The breed was {{sometimes}} called [...] "Tarasconnais", after the town, and was famous for the high quality of its legs {{and the ability to}} survive on poor food. It was used to breed mules, and the Pyrenees mule was derived from a cross between Catalan donkeys and horses of the Breton, Mérens and other breeds. Before World War I, almost 1,000 Pyrenees mules were born annually in the Ariege department. The first breed show was organized in 1872. By the end of the 19th century, horses from the Pyrenees were known for their use as light cavalry.

500|$|Like {{many other}} French breeds from the Pyrenees, the Castillonnais {{probably}} descends from the horses {{that inspired the}} Magdalenian-era paintings found, for example, at the Cave of Niaux. Over time, blood from Oriental and Iberian horses {{was added to the}} breed, and influenced its physical appearance and temperament. The Castillonnais was originally known as the [...] "cheval du Biros" [...] (Biros horse) or [...] "Saint-Gironnais", a name from the town of Saint-Girons in Ariege in the Pyrenees, where a large <b>horse</b> <b>fair</b> was held the day after All Saints' Day. In the late nineteenth century, horses of the Pyrenees were known for their use as mounts by light cavalry. In 1908, Gabriel Lamarque, equine historian and president of the Société d’agriculture de l’Ariège (Agricultural Society of Ariege), began to study the breed as part of his work in the development of native horse populations in France.|$|E
