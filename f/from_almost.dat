5|$|According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), {{the total}} number of animals used in the US during 2015 was 820,812, down <b>from</b> <b>almost</b> 1.2 million in 2005, however, this number does not include rats and mice, which make up around 90% of {{research}} animals. By comparing with EU data, where all vertebrate species are counted, Speaking of Research estimated that around 12 million vertebrates were used in research in the US in 2016. A 2015 article published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, argued that the use of animals in the US has dramatically increased in recent years. Researchers found this increase is largely the result of an increased reliance on genetically modified mice in animal studies.|$|E
5|$|After architects Mario Bellini and Rudy Ricciotti had won an {{international}} competition to create its new galleries for Islamic art, the new 3,000 sq m pavilion eventually opened in 2012, consisting of ground- and lower-ground-level interior spaces {{topped by a}} golden, undulating roof (fashioned <b>from</b> <b>almost</b> 9,000 steel tubes that form an interior web) that seems to float within the neo-Classical Visconti Courtyard {{in the middle of}} the Louvre's south wing.

5|$|In the US, {{the case}} {{fatality}} rate {{is estimated to}} be 21% by 30days after TBI. A study on Iraq War soldiers found that severe TBI carries a mortality of 30–50%. Deaths have declined due to improved treatments and systems for managing trauma in societies wealthy enough to provide modern emergency and neurosurgical services. The fraction of those who die after being hospitalized with TBI fell <b>from</b> <b>almost</b> half in the 1970s to about a quarter {{at the beginning of the}} 21stcentury. This decline in mortality has led to a concomitant increase in the number of people living with disabilities that result from TBI.|$|E

He wrote many of his motets for four voices, an ensemble size which had become the compositional norm around 1500, and he was also a considerable innovator in writing motets for five and six voices. No motets of more than six voices have been reliably attributed to Josquin.|$|E
5|$|Most birds can fly, which distinguishes them <b>from</b> <b>almost</b> {{all other}} {{vertebrate}} classes. Flight {{is the primary}} means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for searching for food and for escaping from predators. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, {{as well as a}} modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the prison}} {{came under the}} control of the colonial government, it was renamed Fremantle Prison. All prisoners in Perth Gaol were {{transferred}} to Fremantle, and from 1887 female prisoners were also imprisoned there, in their own separate section. The Western Australian gold rushes of the 1890s resulted in strong economic growth, and a massive increase in population: doubling <b>from</b> <b>almost</b> 50,000 in 1891 to more than 100,000 by 1895, and to 184,000 by 1901.

While the ceramic images were constructed out of clay tiles, the mosaic icons were more varied in their material, which included clay, glass, and stone of various shades on a gold-coloured background. Among the portrayed saints and biblical figures are Charalampus and perhaps Joel. Some of the images were enclosed in ellipses.|$|E
5|$|The first {{campaign}} in 492 BC, led by Mardonius, re-subjugated Thrace and forced Macedon {{to become a}} fully subordinate client kingdom part of Persia, after being a vassal to Persia {{as early as the}} late 6th century BC.

The following year, having demonstrated his intentions, Darius sent ambassadors to all parts of Greece, demanding their submission.
