Most of us possess the power of voluntary motion. We usually {{are not aware of}} the breathing of our lungs or the beating of our heart unless somehow our attention is called to them. Our ability to control either is limited. Our kidneys command our attention on their schedule rather than one we choose. Few of us <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> our liver is doing right now, though this organ is as needful as lungs, heart, or kidneys. The conscious mind is the servant, not the master, of these and other organs. These organs have an agenda the conscious mind did not choose, and over which it has limited power.|$|E
500|$|Selman {{wanted to}} include {{things in the}} episode that [...] "only really hard-core foodies would <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> we were talking about. This was like a love letter to foodie culture." [...] Food {{references}} featured in the episode include jokes about sriracha sauce and sous-vide cooking, referrals to chefs Wylie Dufresne, Frank Bruni, and Ruth Reichl, a mention of the soup phở from Vietnam and how to pronounce it correctly, and {{the inclusion of the}} El Chemistri owner who is based on the Spanish chef José Andrés (known for using molecular gastronomy). Selman has commented that food produced with the help of molecular gastronomy [...] "lends itself to comedy quite nicely. There’s a dish , for instance, called Regret. The waiter cries into your soup when he serves it. The human tear is the final ingredient." [...] The fictional character Swedish Chef is also seen in the episode, and the scene where the meth dealer is reminded of his childhood after eating the apple pie is a reference to the Pixar film Ratatouille, which was written and directed by former Simpsons consultant Brad Bird.|$|E
2500|$|On April 11, 1974, Coleman lost {{a bid for}} {{a no-hitter}} {{in the eighth inning}} when Gene Michael of the New York Yankees hit a one-out single. [...] By May 15, 1974, Coleman had a 6–1 record and {{appeared}} to be on track for the best season of his career. [...] However, he did not win another game for two months, and his performance dropped off markedly. [...] He finished the 1974 season with a 14–12 record and a 4.32 ERA in 41 starts. He walked an astounding 158 batters in 1974 (a Tigers single-season record) for a career high rate of 5.0/9 IP. [...] At the end of the 1974 season, Coleman said: [...] "It was really strange. [...] My arm felt better than it ever had before in my life. But I couldn't do it. [...] It {{was just one of those}} crazy things. At times I didn't <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> I was doing out there." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{station was}} {{ground-breaking}} for UK pirate radio, in that unlike its major rival Radio Caroline it used a tight American top-40 format. [...] "Caroline {{had always been}} what I call catch-as-catch-can radio," [...] said Dave Cash: [...] "You {{used to go out}} there with a bunch of records and play them.

6000|$|... 175. Not so {{with the}} unhappy artist. No one expects any honest or useful work of him; but {{everyone}} expects him to be ingenious. Originality, dexterity, invention, imagination, everything is asked of him except what alone is to be had for asking--honesty and sound work, and the due discharge of his function as a painter. What function? asks the reader in some surprise. He may well ask; for I suppose few painters <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> their function is, or even that they have any at all.|$|E

Why, I'd be lost. I wouldn't know how to start. [With a laugh.] I know {{this sounds like a}} confession of weakness but it's true just the same. [Frowning again.] However, naturally my work must always be the first consideration. Yes, absolutely! [Then with glad relief.] But what's the use of rambling on this way?

First, will your ladyship allow me to ask you whether you have had any strange visitors this morning? I don't mean fashionable visitors, but such visitors, for instance, as Miss Barbary's old servant, or as a person without the use of his lower extremities, carried upstairs similarly to a guy?" ...|$|E
60|$|When Abram Garfield {{came to this}} lonely {{lodge in}} the primaeval woodlands, he had one son and one daughter. In 1831, the year after his removal to his new home, a second boy was born into the family, whom his father named James Abram. Before the baby was {{eighteen}} months old, the father died, and was buried alone, after the only possible fashion among such solitary settlers, {{in a corner of}} the wheat field which he himself had cleared of its stumps. A widow's life is always a hard one, but in such a country and under such conditions it is even harder and more lonely than elsewhere. Mrs. Garfield's eldest boy, Thomas, was only eleven years old; and with the aid of this one ineffectual helper, she managed herself to carry on the farm for many years. Only those who know the hard toil of a raw American township can <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> that really means. A farmer's work in America is not like a farmer's work in England. The man who occupies the soil is there at once his own landlord and his own labourer; and he has to contend with nature as nobody in England has had to contend with it for the last five centuries at least. He finds the land covered with trees, which he has first to fell and sell as timber; then he must dig or burn out the stumps; clear the plot of boulders and large stones; drain it, fence it, plough it, and harrow it; build barns for the produce and sheds for the cows; in short, MAKE his farm, instead of merely TAKING it. This is labour from which many strong men shrink in dismay, especially those who have come out fresh from a civilized and fully occupied land. For a woman and a boy, it is a task that seems almost above their utmost powers. Nevertheless, Mrs. Garfield and her son did not fail under it. With her own hands, the mother split up the young trees info rude triangular rails to make the rough snake fences of the country--mere zigzags of wood laid one bit above the other; while the lad worked away bravely at sowing fall and spring wheat, hoeing Indian corn, and building a little barn for the harvest before the arrival of the long cold Ohio winter. To such a family did the future President originally belong; and with them he must have shared those strong qualities of perseverance and industry which more than anything else at length secured his ultimate success in life.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the middle}} of the show's first season, it is {{revealed}} that Bartlet has multiple sclerosis. According to Sorkin, this was not planned; the plot came about because he wanted to write an episode in which the president was in bed watching a soap opera and the audience discovered that the first lady was a physician.

I don't think they <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> it takes to achieve the professionalism and expertise and the right people to express a variety of points of view[...] [...] [...] What Tomlinson's doing, I think, is trying to scare public broadcasters.'
