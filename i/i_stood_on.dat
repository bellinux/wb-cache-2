All sang chorus! <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> {{the stage and}} conducted the encore – funny sight!" [...] With characteristic grace, the composer wrote to Kipling, [...] "Your splendid words went with a swing and enthusiasm which even my music cannot stifle". Kipling, on the other hand, described the music as [...] "a tune guaranteed to pull teeth out of barrel-organs".|$|E

The last entry of Markings is dated 24 August 1961: [...] "Is it a new country/In another world of reality/Than Day's?/Or did I live there/Before Day was?/ I awoke/To an {{ordinary}} morning with grey light/Reflected from the street,/But still remembered/The dark-blue night/Above the tree line,/The open moor in moonlight,/The crest in shadow,/Remembered other dreams/Of the same mountain country:/Twice <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> its summits,/I stayed by its remotest lake,/And followed the river/Towards its source./The seasons have changed/And the light/And the weather/And the hour./But it is the same land./And I begin to know the map/And to get my bearings." ...|$|E
2500|$|William Holden and Stanwyck {{were friends}} of long standing. [...] When Stanwyck and Holden were {{presenting}} the Best Sound Oscar for 1977, Holden paused {{to pay a}} special tribute to her for saving his career when Holden was cast in the lead for Golden Boy (1939). After a series of unsteady daily performances, {{he was about to}} be fired, but Stanwyck staunchly defended him, successfully standing up to the film producers. Shortly after Holden's death, Stanwyck recalled the moment when receiving her honorary Oscar: [...] "A few years ago <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> this stage with William Holden as a presenter. I loved him very much, and I miss him. He always wished that I would get an Oscar. And so tonight, my golden boy, you got your wish." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{structure}} probably {{originated in}} the 13thcentury. [...] During the later part of the 16thcentury the tower was leased to two city guilds, the Painters and Stationers, and the Barbers and Chandlers, who sublet it to other guilds. [...] By 1612 {{the fabric of the}} tower was in a poor condition, and the lead had been lost from its roof. [...] It was restored by the two guilds, and above the door they placed a plaque containing the date 1613 and a carving of a phoenix, the emblem of the Painters. [...] In the Civil War, during the Siege of Chester in 1645, the tower had a gun in each storey, and it was damaged in the conflict. [...] A plaque on the tower states that King Charles <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> the tower on 24September 1645 as he watched his soldiers being defeated at the Battle of Rowton Heath. The historian Simon Ward has expressed doubts about this and has suggested that the king may have stood instead on a tower of Chester Cathedral, which he considers is confirmed by evidence that a captain standing beside him was killed by a stray shot.|$|E
