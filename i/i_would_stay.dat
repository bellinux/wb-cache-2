The Liberal {{government}} was in trouble over Egypt and the Bradlaugh incident; and the Conservatives were internally divided. [...] He hunted for the Beaufort Hounds. I selected as my time, midnight until, if necessary, eight in the morning. [...] I used to leave London at 5.30 in the morning, providing the House was up, take the train down to Chippenham, have my hunt, {{and get back to}} London by train leaving Chippenham about 7.30...

2500|$|Anger {{has always}} been an [...] "extremely private individual," [...] {{although}} he has given various interviews over the years, with one interviewer, David Wingrove, describing him in 2008 as [...] "a joy. Gentle, soft-spoken, immaculately tanned, he looks a good two decades younger than his 78 years". In such interviews, he refuses to disclose information on his name change from Anglemeyer to Anger, telling an interviewer who brought the topic up in 2004 that [...] "You're being impertinent. It says Anger on my passport, that's all you need to know. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>stay</b> away from that subject if I were you." [...] In a 2010 interview, however, he stated that [...] "I just condensed my name. I knew it would be like a label, a logo. It's easy to remember." [...] Anger is openly gay, with one of his friends describing how he [...] "was attracted to people who were either well endowed or the Arnold Schwarzenegger type." [...] He once joked that he was [...] "somewhat {{to the right of the}} KKK" [...] in his views about black people, opening him up to criticism for racism. He is a passionate supporter of the Tibetan independence movement.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{disclosed}} that Arnault planned {{to apply for}} Belgian citizenship and was considering moving to Belgium in 2013. In April 2013, Arnault {{said that he had}} been misquoted and that he never intended to leave France: [...] "I repeatedly said that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>stay</b> as a resident in France and that I would continue to pay my taxes.... Today, I decided to remove any ambiguity. I withdraw my request of Belgian nationality. Requesting Belgian nationality was to better protect the foundation that I created with the sole purpose of ensuring the continuity and integrity of the LVMH group if I were to disappear." [...] On 10 April 2013, Arnault announced that he had decided to abandon his application for Belgian citizenship, saying he did not want the move to be misinterpreted as a measure of tax evasion at a time when France faced economic and social challenges. Arnault also stated that several employees requested to leave France for tax purposes, that he declined their requests, and that [...] "the 75% tax would not raise a lot of revenue but should prove less divisive now that it was set to be levied on firms rather than people and only due to stay in place for two years." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "If I went to South America <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{probably}} <b>stay</b> {{there the}} rest of my natural days and boss those greasers. If I went to Mexico <b>I</b> <b>would</b> probably <b>stay</b> there a while. If I took a good Federal appointment <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be right here all the time. But I may go to Venezuela after all. It's a fine country, and there are untold opportunities there for a hustler.|$|R
6000|$|... "My master says I must go, Emir; and I must obey his orders, though <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>stay</b> with him. Tonight, I will leave." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{always loved}} her world--and yet--and yet I think that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>stay</b> if I could stay.|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} hung back abashed. “Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>stay</b> for ever, if your ladyship bade me,” he said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I {{promised that}} I {{would be in}} Onslow Terrace to-morrow, and she must not think that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>stay</b> away if I could avoid it." ...|$|E
60|$|Then I went away. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>stayed</b> {{the night}} at this house: I wanted to. But I had {{developed}} my Austrian character too far.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, there,' he returned, 'you {{have hit}} a sore place. To speak truly, dear, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>stay</b> unpolished {{a hundred years}} than take your money.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To shoot bears, my pretty Klara," [...] he replied. [...] "I don't want to go. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>stay</b> {{another week}} {{here for you}} to amuse me, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Phil, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>stay</b> {{with all}} my heart," [...] said Aspel hastily, [...] "but--but--the fact is--I've not seen May for a long time, and--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "This {{is all the}} advice, {{in these}} unhappy circumstances, I am in a {{condition}} to give. Had I still had resources, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>stayed</b> by them (SO WEHRE ICH DARBEI GEBLIEBEN).|$|R
6000|$|... "Very likely," [...] {{said the}} Languid Youth; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>stay</b> outside {{and let you}} go up in the corner. The {{performance}} in that way will be more interesting to me." ...|$|R

60|$|Mr. Larramie and Walter {{promised to}} get up some fine {{excursions}} if <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>stay</b> a little longer, and Genevieve made me sit down beside her under a tree.|$|E
60|$|I {{should like}} to know before coming, that while some of you wish me to come, {{there may not be}} others who would quite as lief <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>stay</b> away. Write me again.|$|E

60|$|Her {{voice was}} a little tremulous, but very low and rich. For some reason or other, on {{getting back to the}} inn, I {{countermanded}} the horses, and said <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>stay</b> for the night.|$|E
60|$|In truth I could see, and {{my vision}} {{confirmed}} {{me in my}} resolve, though that was like the very parting of spirit and flesh. Yet a little longer <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>stay</b> since {{it was the last}} time.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nevertheless, I won't stay! Neither law nor gospel demands it of {{me after}} what I have learnt. And if law and gospel did demand it, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>stay.</b> And {{if you will}} not help me to escape, I go alone.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know why}} I left you, father; and I {{had reason to}} {{distrust}} you, because I felt sure that you had deceived my mother. If I could have trusted you, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>stayed</b> with you and worked for you." ...|$|R

6000|$|A little pang {{went through}} her heart, but she retorted, [...] "I {{would n't go to}} Europe to escape it, nor up the Nile. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>stay</b> and fight it where I was." [...] "Stay?" [...] He seemed to have caught {{hopefully}} at the word.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{two people}} tell one differently, {{it must be}} right to cling to one and leave the other. No man can serve two masters. I have got to obey my husband. Even were I to say that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>stay,</b> he could come and take me away.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I must go. I shall {{probably}} find some work awaiting me. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>stay</b> {{to show you}} over the house, but Barrymore {{will be a better}} guide than I. Good-bye, and never hesitate night or day to send for me if I can be of service." ...|$|E
