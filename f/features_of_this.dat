5|$|Examination of the spectrographic <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> star {{showed the}} {{characteristic}} absorption line shift of a binary star system. This shift is created when their orbit carries the member stars toward and then {{away from the}} observer, producing a doppler shift in the wavelength of the line features. The measurement of this shift allows astronomers to determine the relative orbital velocity {{of at least one}} of the stars even though they are unable to resolve the individual components.|$|E
5|$|The expedition's {{ship was}} built by the Dundee Shipbuilders Company as a {{specialist}} research vessel designed for work in Antarctic waters, {{and was one of}} the last three-masted wooden sailing ships built in Britain. The construction cost was £34,050 (2009 = £2.7 million), plus £10,322 (£830,000) for the engines, and the final cost after all modifications was £51,000 (£4.1 m). The name had historic naval associations, most recently as one of the ships used in the Nares expedition, and certain <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> older vessel were incorporated into the design of the new ship. She was launched by Lady Markham on 21 March 1901 as S.Y. Discovery (the Royal Research Ship designation was acquired in the 1920s).|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between sections 3 and 4 and parliamentary sovereignty has been commented on most extensively. The most common criticism {{has been of}} the implied limitations on legislative supremacy. Opponents of this criticism has questioned both its factual accuracy and its suggestion that the weakening of parliamentary sovereignty should be avoided. They instead cite morality and constitutionalism as among positive <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> change. The limits of courts' powers have also been queried. The retroactivity of law making is one criticism related {{to the rule of}} law, although the advancement of human rights is seen as a positive feature also associated with the rule of law. Whilst the scope of section 3 has been criticised for being vague and there have been warnings of to the imposition of the judiciary on parliament's domain, these have also been challenged.|$|E

5|$|There {{were two}} key {{catalysts}} beyond Radama's affinity for Creole architecture that inspired Gros to innovate so far beyond traditional construction norms: the recent {{construction of a}} two-storey house with a balcony in the neighbourhood of Andohalo by a British missionary (the first balcony in highland Madagascar), and the 1823 arrival of Princess Rasalimo to the Rova, necessitating the redesign of Bevato as her residence. Rasalimo, whose marriage to Radama secured the peace between the Merina Kingdom and that of her Sakalava people on the west coast, was made Radama's principal wife and reportedly demanded an exceptional palace for her home. This request led Radama to employ a Creole architect named Jean Julien to design the unprecedented two-storey house. Although historic sources are divided on whether Tranovola, Bevato or Marivolanitra was the first two-storey house at the Rova, the innovations embodied in these buildings and particularly in Tranovola underscore the rising influence of foreign architectural norms in Imerina. Tranovola is widely represented by historians as the first true example of the hybridisation of Merina architectural norms and those of Europe, and its design served {{as a model for}} the larger Manjakamiadana palace some years later. The innovative <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> building and the Manjakamiadana it inspired—particularly the verandas supported by exterior columns—became the new norm in highlands architecture, especially upon the adoption of brick as the principal building material.|$|E
5|$|The Witness {{uses its}} own engine {{developed}} by Blow and his team, which took {{a significant portion}} of the development time. Blow was insistent on using his own game engine instead of an existing solution such as Unity, as he would be able to fully control every element of a game engine that he created himself. As a compact game world compared to open-world games, the whole of the island of The Witness was treated as one zone, simplifying the gameplay and engine development. This presented a secondary challenge to the team as to concurrently work on the project, they needed to find a means to allow multiple developers to edit areas without resorting to using locking on their version control system as well as being able to work without being connected to a central server. Blow and his team developed an unconventional means of serializing the game world into text files that would have revision control while at the same time making it easy for individuals to discover conflicting edits. They also converted the 10,000-some entities in the game world into their own individual files for tracking to further reduce conflict between edits. Other <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> system including using defined control points for terrain elements to automatically recalculate seamless connections between them within the game's rendering engine, and a built-in world editor within the game engine to easily access existing serialized elements and create new ones.|$|E
