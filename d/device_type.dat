25|$|Lower {{transconductance}}: The transconductance of the MOSFET decides its {{gain and}} {{is proportional to}} hole or electron mobility (depending on <b>device</b> <b>type),</b> at least for low drain voltages. As MOSFET size is reduced, the fields in the channel increase and the dopant impurity levels increase. Both changes reduce the carrier mobility, and hence the transconductance. As channel lengths are reduced without proportional reduction in drain voltage, raising the electric field in the channel, the result is velocity saturation of the carriers, limiting the current and the transconductance.|$|E

25|$|The {{threshold}} voltage (and consequently the drain to source on-current) is modified {{by the work}} function difference between the gate material and channel material. Because polysilicon is a semiconductor, its work function can be modulated by adjusting the type and level of doping. Furthermore, because polysilicon has the same bandgap as the underlying silicon channel, it is quite straightforward to tune the work function to achieve low {{threshold voltage}}s for both NMOS and PMOS devices. By contrast, the work functions of metals are not easily modulated, so tuning the work function to obtain low threshold voltages becomes a significant challenge. Additionally, obtaining low-threshold devices on both PMOS and NMOS devices sometimes {{requires the use of}} different metals for each <b>device</b> <b>type.</b> While bimetallic integrated circuits (i.e., one type of metal for gate electrodes of NFETS and a second type of metal for gate electrodes of PFETS) are not common, they are known in patent literature and provide some benefit in terms of tuning electrical circuits' overall electrical performance.|$|E

40|$|Security {{experts have}} {{demonstrated}} numerous risks imposed by Internet of Things (IoT) devices on organizations. Due to the widespread adoption of such devices, their diversity, standardization obstacles, and inherent mobility, organizations require an intelligent mechanism capable of automatically detecting suspicious IoT devices connected to their networks. In particular, devices {{not included in}} a white list of trustworthy IoT <b>device</b> <b>types</b> (allowed to be used within the organizational premises) should be detected. In this research, Random Forest, a supervised machine learning algorithm, was applied to features extracted from network traffic data {{with the aim of}} accurately identifying IoT <b>device</b> <b>types</b> from the white list. To train and evaluate multi-class classifiers, we collected and manually labeled network traffic data from 17 distinct IoT <b>devices,</b> representing nine <b>types</b> of IoT <b>devices.</b> Based on the classification of 20 consecutive sessions and the use of majority rule, IoT <b>device</b> <b>types</b> that are not on the white list were correctly detected as unknown in 96 % of test cases (on average), and white listed <b>device</b> <b>types</b> were correctly classified by their actual types in 99 % of cases. Some IoT <b>device</b> <b>types</b> were identified quicker than others (e. g., sockets and thermostats were successfully detected within five TCP sessions of connecting to the network). Perfect detection of unauthorized IoT <b>device</b> <b>types</b> was achieved upon analyzing 110 consecutive sessions; perfect classification of white listed types required 346 consecutive sessions, 110 of which resulted in 99. 49 % accuracy. Further experiments demonstrated the successful applicability of classifiers trained in one location and tested on another. In addition, a discussion is provided regarding the resilience of our machine learning-based IoT white listing method to adversarial attacks...|$|R

Abstract There are two possible solutions: own a subset of devices on the market or try to potentially reach all of them without owning them.

40|$|Hybrid systems {{consisting}} of a multitude of different computing <b>device</b> <b>types</b> are interesting targets for high-performance applications. Chip multiprocessors, FPGAs, DSPs, and GPUs can be readily put together into a hybrid system; however, {{it is not at}} all clear that one can effectively deploy applications on such a system. Coordinating multiple languages, especially very different languages like hardware and software languages, is awkward and error prone. Additionally, implementing communication mechanisms between different <b>device</b> <b>types</b> unnecessarily increases development time. This is compounded by the fact that the application developer, to be effective, needs performance data about the application early in the design cycle. We describe an application development environment specifically targeted at hybrid systems, supporting data-flow semantics between application kernels deployed on a variety of <b>device</b> <b>types.</b> A specific feature of the development environment is the availability of performance estimates (via simulation) prior to actual deployment on a physical system...|$|R
