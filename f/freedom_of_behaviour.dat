40|$|Purpose {{and meaning}} are {{necessary}} concepts for understanding mind and culture, but {{appear to be}} absent from the physical world and {{are not part of}} the explanatory framework of the natural sciences. Understanding how meaning (in the broad sense of the term) could arise from a physical world has proven to be a tough problem. The basic scheme of Darwinian evolution produces adaptations that only represent apparent ("as if") goals and meaning. Here I use evolutionary models to show that a slight, evolvable extension of the basic scheme is sufficient to produce genuine goals. The extension, targeted modulation of mutation rate, is known to be generally present in biological cells, and gives rise to two phenomena that are absent from the non-living world: intrinsic meaning and the ability to initiate goal-directed chains of causation (active causation). The extended scheme accomplishes this by utilizing randomness modulated by a feedback loop that is itself regulated by evolutionary pressure. The mechanism can be extended to behavioural variability as well, and thus shows how <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> is possible. A further extension to communication suggests that the active exchange of intrinsic meaning between organisms may be the origin of consciousness, which in combination with active causation can provide a physical basis for the phenomenon of free will.

40|$|Public spaces {{understood}} as areas {{which can be}} accessed freely and which offer <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> and speech have always been {{an important element of}} any city or town. Shopping malls enter urban landscape often becoming city landmarks, thus, competing with traditional public spaces. In terms of qualitative criteria, they function well as public spaces {{but at the same time}} those areas include numerous limitations which prevent them from being real public spaces. Within the public-private dimension, they constitute transitional hybrid spaces with the features of a proper public space. Shop-ping malls focus important social functions, thus, replacing or “relieving” traditional public spaces in city centres. One must remember, though, that their public character is severely limited (time, offer, staff, behaviour, social, or political limitations) which is why it is difficult to consider shopping malls as classic public spaces. Because of the role of those modern shopping and service spaces it is necessary to try and place shopping malls in relation to urban public spaces. The goal should be to define certain relations between traditional public spaces and hybrid spaces (including the areas of shopping malls) in order for them to benefit the inhabitants and to help improve the functioning of cities or towns. The fact that shopping malls have, to a large extent, substituted public spaces, that they are visited often, that they are the place where people spend a considerable amount of their free time and that they are considered by the population as important locations in people's lives seem particularly important...|$|E
40|$|The {{success of}} family {{businesses}} is {{largely due to}} a circular relationship in which three intangible factors enhance each other: love for the family business, trust among different business factors, and <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> for family members (Gallo et al., 2001). These values are the cornerstone on which family members base their commitment to the business. But how can family members of advanced generations, especially those who are not active in the business, become more committed {{to the success of the}} family business? And are there gender-specific roles, as the literature on this subject seems to indicate? The research outlined in this document seeks to enlarge the current pool of knowledge, offering the results of a study involving 98 Spanish family businesses, in which a total of 200 non-active family members responded to a questionnaire about their relationship with the family business and their associated relatives. The main results confirm the existing literature by revealing that women are expected to play certain roles such as managing the household and child-rearing. Even though these roles are not clearly defined, women perceive numerous obstacles when attempting to assume roles beyond the domestic sphere. Nevertheless, our results confirm that, regardless of the degree of women’s direct participation in the family business, their strong commitment towards the business as well as their other qualities can permeate the family relationship to the point of affecting the business performance by influencing the entrepreneur’s motivation and businessrelated decisions. Through her passion for the family she provides the business with a powerful asset: the strong “family glue”...|$|E

40|$|The Act o f 17 th May 1989 {{concerning}} guaranty {{of freedom}} of conscience and religion is particularly important for {{the realization of the}} rights of individuals. It has settled a system of quaranty {{of freedom of}} conscience and religion, and has determined the principles nad limits of state intervention in the realization of individual’s freedom of conscience and religion. The preamble to the Act concerning guaranties, where the legislator refers to constitutional norms and regulations of international law, may mean that the Act was intended to be a collection of regulations of universal importance. The provisions of Chapter 1 include a system of institutional legal guaranties allowing every individual to confess any religion or none. To secure the individual a freedom in matters of religion, the freedom of conscience must be extended by the freedom to demonstrate the individual’s relation to religion, and a <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> according to his beliefs. Therefore in the subsequent Chapters freedom of conscience and religion has been presented {{from the point of view}} of religious unions. In this aspect it means to grant the citizen full rights of free exercise of religious practice within the legal order of the country, and to provide him by the state with all corporative rights. The existing legal solutions, however, call for some critical remarks. Objections should be raised to the too general regulation of the problems of freedom of conscience and religion in the Constitution of 1952. Also the method of positive determination of the limits of freedom of conscience and religion, adopted by the Act concerning guaranty, is controversial. In the author’s opinion at least an attempt should be made to determine what is not covered by the term „freedom of conscience and religion”. Besides, the part of the Act referring to relations between the churches (religious unions) and the Religious Denominations Office became outdated and must be amended possibly soon.

40|$|With {{respect to}} the group society of Polistes chinensis antennalis Perez, the {{relation}} of their order has been clarified by observing the inferior and superior behaviours among individuals. Among individuals constituting a group, their relation of order nearly linear is in existence. In such a series of order, founding females almost always occupies the most predominant position. Among individuals of a new generation, the individuals feathering in earlier periods generally occupy a higher rank. Such order, however, is not necessarily stationary, but a variation i n the order sometimes takes place partly. Dominance behaviour is frequently carried out among the individuals, whose order is relatively close one another. Especially {{in case of a}} struggle for an upper order, the most severe attack is launched on individuals at the rank directly subordinate. Between the founding females at the highest rank and other individuals, such dominance behaviours are not so frequently carried out. When after the constitution of a group, the number of aged individuals becomes increased and the founding females grow remarkably weakened by age after the lapse of a considerably large number of days, interference between the founding females and these individuals becomes intense and the number of times of the dominance behaviour is increased. As the result of the observation o f superior and inferior behaviours in a group composed of individuals of the same age, it was clarified that the distinguished differences depending on individuals is being observed in the behaviours of these individuals. It appears that this phenomenon has a bearing on the formation of the orderly system in a group society. The fact that the superior and inferior behaviours are observed among the individuals in a group, indicates the existence of psychological and social tension among these individuals. With the degree of tension further grown, it is believed that the social interference among these individuals becomes intensified, and the frequency of superior and inferior behaviours becomes higher. The index representing the intensity of tension among component members of the group society may be calculated by the following formula. Td=N× 100 h×n (n - 1) 2 where Td: degree of tension, N: number of o b servations of the superior and inferior behaviours, h: time of observation, and n: mean number of individuals at the time of observation. When the change in social tension incidental to the course of development of the group society is examined through this method, an intensely strained state is observed among the individuals {{for a short period of}} time immediately after the formation of a group. This strained state is mitigated in due time, until finally a stable state is reached. After that, a period of relatively stabilized condition continues, though slight variations may be found. With the weakening by age of founding females, however, the degree of tension is increased once again. Following the death of founding females, a sudden increase of tension takes place. Making inquiries into the base of such phenomena, it may reasonably be concluded that the existence of the individuals extremely predominent exerts psychological pressure on other individuals, there by interfering with the growth of the strained state among these individuals, and restraining the superior and inferior behaviours, and thus the existence of the individuals extremely predominant plays an important role in the maintenance of the social order. As the result of the superior and inferior behaviours, each individual may find its position occupying in the series of order within the group, to which it belongs, and consequently the number of severe struggles among them may be reduced. It may be surmised, furthermore, that the restriction of the <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> of each individual serves for the establishment of order in the entire society of nest, the smooth operation of the social life and the growth of the society...|$|E

40|$|Communication is key {{to change}} {{consumption}} behaviour. Consumers 9 ̆ 2 information activities are mainly applied to influence the private consumption at an individual level. Empowerment {{at the individual level}} can be achieved through the provision of possibilities for acquiring a sense of competence and self-determination. Moreover, by convincing consumers to make specific changes in their lifestyle, people should be trusted to be able to infer the appropriate behaviour change. In this respect important measures are information {{about the impact of the}} current lifestyle and activating instruments that offer the <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> choice. <b>Behaviour</b> is a complex combination of emotions, habits and normative factors, thus the change of these components is a challenge. Success of interventions to change people 9 ̆ 2 s everyday behaviour or lifestyle will depend on measures that address and stabilize individual habits. Stand alone advice programs might successfully change everyday actions that are weakly or not habitual while strongly habitual actions require disrupting present routines and establish new ones. One major strategy is the provision of feedback systems, i. e. providing consumer with frequent informative evidence on energy consumption, CO 2 reduction and associated costs. However, longevity of behavioural change from feedback needs to be taken into consideration, as often once the feedback is removed households tend to reverse back to their old behaviours. In this concern, the workshop will discuss the social dimension and new instruments to support the collective progress and to contribute the mainstreaming sustainable consumption patterns by building communities, e. g. around information campaigns or website platforms...|$|R
