50|$|The basic {{requirements}} {{to obtain the}} license and the privileges it confers are agreed internationally by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). However the actual implementation varies quite widely from country to country. According to ICAO, {{to be eligible for}} a commercial pilot license, the applicant must be able to read, speak, write, and understand English: already hold a private pilot license, have received training in the areas of a commercial pilot, and successfully complete the relevant written exams. To proceed in obtaining a commercial pilot license, the applicant must first obtain first-class medical certification. The JAA has several approved courses leading to the issue of a JAA commercial pilot's license with an instrument rating without first obtaining a private pilot's license. Upon completing those prerequisites the applicant will then receive an exam from the governing aviation body that consists of an oral and practical flight test from an <b>examiner.</b> <b>Applicants</b> for a CPL (aeroplanes) must also have completed a solo cross-country flight of at least 300 nm with full-stop landings at two airfields other than the pilot's airfield of origin.|$|R
40|$|Prior art patent {{citations}} {{have become}} a popular measure of patent quality and knowledge flow between firms. Interpreting these measurements is complicated, in some cases, because prior art citations are added by patent examiners {{as well as by}} patent applicants. The U. S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) adopted new reporting procedures in 2001, making it possible to measure <b>examiner</b> and <b>applicant</b> citations separately for the first time. We analyzed prior art citations listed in all U. S. patents granted in 2001 - 2003, and found that examiners {{played a significant role in}} identifying prior art, adding 63 % of citations on the average patent, and all citations on 40 % of patents granted. An analysis of variance found that firm-specific variables explain most of the variation in examiner-citation shares. Using multivariate regression, we found that foreign applicants to the USPTO had the highest proportion of citations added by <b>examiners.</b> High-volume patent <b>applicants</b> had a greater proportion of examiner citations, and a substantial number of firms won patents without listing a single applicant citation. In terms of technology, we found higher examiner shares among patents in electronics, communications, and computer-related fields. Taken together, our findings suggest that firm-level patenting practices, particularly among high-volume applicants, have a strong influence on citation data and merit additional research.

50|$|An {{applicant}} may overcome {{objections to}} the application by argument or amendment. If the examiner is satisfied, the application is allowed and a patent is issued. If the examiner is not satisfied, the examiner will issue a final action letter, with reasons for rejecting the application. A rejection can be appealed to a Patent Appeal Board comprising senior patent office <b>examiners.</b> If the <b>applicant</b> is unsuccessful there, {{he or she can}} appeal directly to the Federal Court and ultimately the Supreme Court of Canada.|$|R
40|$|There {{is concern}} that patent {{examiners}} lack the resources, capabilities, and incentives to properly identify the prior art against which patent applications are evaluated and that, as a result, they issue {{a large number}} of low-quality patents. In this context, the extent to which applicants have incentives to contribute prior art is an important question. This paper uses data on <b>examiner</b> and <b>applicant</b> citations in U. S. patents to examine this question. The data show that applicants contribute a surprisingly low share of citations to previous patents and routinely fail to identify even their own previous patents. However, there are also stark differences across fields. Within fields, and even within firms, there is self-sorting: applicants contribute more prior art for their more important inventions. The results suggest that incentives to search for prior art vary across industries and inventions, which reflects underlying differences in the strategic reasons for obtaining patent protection.

50|$|The {{procedure}} to register a trade mark in Australia {{is much the}} same as other countries. A completed application is filed with IP Australia (either by delivery to one of its regional offices or electronically) and checked ("examined") by an examiner of trade marks for compliance with formalities and substantive requirements (e.g. registrability, and lack of confusing similarity with a conflicting trade mark). The Australian Trade Marks Office Manual of Practice and Procedure is an official publication produced by IP Australia, which provides detailed information to <b>examiners</b> and <b>applicants</b> on the practices and procedures relating to the filing, examination, and registration of a trade mark in accordance with the provisions of the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth). If an application is accepted, it will be published for opposition purposes for three months, during which time third parties may oppose registration on certain grounds. If there are no oppositions, or any oppositions are overcome, a certificate of registration will issue.|$|R
50|$|A {{qualified}} examiner {{examines the}} application (Article 47). The <b>examiner</b> notifies the <b>applicant</b> {{of the reasons}} for refusal before making the decision to refuse a patent (Article 50), pointing out that some of the above conditions for patent are not met. The applicant may submit a statement or amendments against the reasons for refusal, within a time limit designated by the examiner (Article 17bis and 50). The time limit is normally 60 days after the date of notification for applicants living in Japan, or three months after the date of notification for applicants living in foreign countries.|$|R

Prior to being allowed to take [...] "the checkride" [...] (the assessment flight by an FAA <b>examiner</b> to determine <b>applicant's</b> readiness to be issued a license), the applicant {{will have to take}} and pass a written examination on the ground school curriculum.|$|R
5000|$|Third {{parties who}} submit prior art during the patent {{application}} cannot argue {{in favor of}} that prior art during the prosecution of the patent (the discussion between the <b>examiner</b> and the <b>applicant).</b> During this ex parte discussion, the applicant has a definite advantage in arguing his or her case. Third parties will therefore wait and reserve their prior art for court cases where they have an equal chance to argue their point. This argument rests on the premise that third parties are willing to assume the hundreds of thousands (or often millions) of dollars in costs that a court challenge requires.|$|R
40|$|With the {{widespread}} of computer software in recent decades, software patent has become controversial for the patent system. Of the many patentability requirements, {{patentable subject matter}} serves as a gatekeeping function to prevent a patent from preempting future innovation. Software patents may easily fall into the gray area of abstract ideas, whose allowance may hinder future innovation. However, without a clear definition of abstract ideas, determining the patent claim subject matter eligibility is a challenging task for <b>examiners</b> and <b>applicants.</b> Â In this research, in order to solve the software patent eligibility issues,Â we propose an effective model to determine patent claim eligibility by text-mining and machine learning techniques. Â Drawing upon USPTO issued guidelines, we identify 66 patent cases to design domain knowledge features, including abstractness features and distinguishable word features, {{as well as other}} textual features, to develop the claim eligibility prediction model. The experiment results show our proposed model reaches the accuracy of more than 80 %, and domain knowledge features {{play a crucial role in}} our prediction model...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Current patent systems face {{a serious}} problem of declining quality of patents as the larger number of ap-plications make it {{difficult}} for patent officers to spend enough time for evaluating each application. For building a better patent system, it is necessary to define a public consensus on the quality of patent applications in a quantitative way. In this article, we tackle the problem of assessing the quality of patent applications based on machine learning and text mining techniques. For each patent application, our tool automatically computes a score called patentability, which indicates how likely it is that the application will be approved by the patent office. We employ a new statis-tical prediction model to estimate examination results (approval or rejection) based on a large data set including 0. 3 million patent applications. The model computes the patentability score based on a set of feature variables including the text contents of the specification documents. Experimental results showed that our model outperforms a conven-tional method which uses only the structural properties of the documents. Since users can access the estimated result through a Web-browser-based GUI, this system allows both patent <b>examiners</b> and <b>applicants</b> to quickly detect weak applications and to find their specific flaws...|$|R
40|$|Researchers {{studying}} innovation increasingly use indicators {{based on}} patent citations. However, {{it is well}} known that not all citations originate from <b>applicants</b> [...] patent <b>examiners</b> contribute to citations listed in issued patents [...] and that this could complicate interpretation of findings in this literature. In 2001 the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) began reporting <b>examiner</b> and <b>applicant</b> citations separately. In this paper, we analyze the prior art citations of all patents granted by the USPTO in 2001 - 2003. We show that examiner citations account for 63 per cent of all citations on the average patent, and that 40 per cent of patents have all citations added by examiners. We use multivariate regression and analysis of variance to identify the determinants of examiner shares. Examiner shares are highest for non-US applicants and in electronics, communications, and computer-related fields. However, most of the variation is explained by firm-specific variables, with the largest patent <b>applicants</b> having high <b>examiner</b> shares. Moreover, a large number of firms are granted patents that contain no applicant prior art. Taken together, our findings suggest that heterogeneity in firm-level patenting practices, in particular by high-volume applicants, has a strong influence on the data. This suggests that analysis of firm-level differences in patenting strategies is an important topic for future research. Technology, patents, patent examiners, prior art, citations...|$|R
50|$|However, if the <b>examiner</b> and the <b>applicant</b> cannot reach {{agreement}} regarding the patentability of the application, the applicant may {{file an appeal}} to either the patent office or a court of law, asserting that his patent application was wrongly rejected. For such an appeal to be successful, the applicant must prove that the patent office was incorrect in applying the law, interpreting the claims on the patent application, or interpreting and applying of the prior art vis-à-vis the patent application. If the appeal is successful, the patent office or court may order that a patent be issued based on the application, or that the patent office correct its examination of the application if the patent office is found to have been incorrect. Otherwise, if the applicant is not found convincing, {{the rejection of the}} patent application may be upheld.|$|R
40|$|We {{devise a}} method for {{automatically}} detecting treatment relationships using lexico-syntactic patterns and its application to medical-oriented patent retrieval. This process for detecting treatment relationships involves finding lexico-syntactic patterns that are highly indicative of treatment relationships and also producing classification rules for those patterns. This treatment relationship detection process is then used in a system to find treatment relationships based on a user query in a medical patent source. The query will consist of terms that the user wants {{to find in the}} subject or object of a treatment relationship. This is of great interest to both patent <b>examiners</b> and patent <b>applicants</b> as they search for prior art. Through the use of classification rules, this system was able to achieve a precision of 85. 81 % on a set of 20 test queries. Categories and Subject Descriptor...|$|R

40|$|All jurisdictions provide reasonableaccommodations for {{applicants}} {{with disabilities}} who are otherwise qualified {{to sit for}} the bar examination. The provision of accommodations is primarily {{a result of the}} comprehensive federal law known as the Americans with Disabilities Act (“the ADA”), passed by Congress in 1990 to prohibit discrimination against persons with disabilities. The ADA protects both applicants with physical disabilities and those with mental disabilities, and accommodations include not only additional testing time, longer and more frequent breaks between testing sessions, and private testing rooms, but also other auxiliary aids and services designed to enable effective communication to and from bar examination applicants. Prior to the adoption of the ADA in 1990, jurisdictions provided accommodations primarily to applicants with physical disabilities, including visual and motor impairments. While applicants have continued to request accommodations for physical disabilities under the ADA, the more challenging cases for bar <b>examiners</b> arise when <b>applicants</b> claim they have mental impairments, as those impairments are not always easily diagnosed or documented. A more detailed discussion of how the ADA affects testing accommodations for bar examination applicants follows, with recommendations as to how bar examiners should address requests for accommodations from applicants with disabilities...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{measures}} the causal effect of {{time out of}} the labor force on subsequent employment of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) applicants and distinguishes it from the discouragement effect of receiving disability benefits. Using a unique Social Security Administration workload database to identify exogenous variation in decision times induced by differences in processing speed among disability <b>examiners</b> to whom <b>applicants</b> are randomly assigned, we find that longer processing times reduce the employment and earnings of SSDI applicants for multiple years following application, with the effects concentrated among applicants awarded benefits during their initial application. A one standard deviation (2. 1 month) increase in initial processing time reduces long-run "substantial gainful activity" rates by 0. 36 percentage points (3. 5 %) and long-run annual earnings by $ 178 (5. 1 %). Because applicants initially denied benefits spend on average more than 15 additional months appealing their denials, previous estimates of the benefit receipt effect are confounded with the effect of delays on subsequent employment. Accounting separately for these channels, we find that the receipt effect is at least 50 % larger than previously estimated. Combining the delay and benefits receipt channels reveals that the SSDI application process reduces subsequent employment of applicants on the margin of award by twice as much as prior literature suggests...|$|R
40|$|In {{certifying}} {{eligibility for}} long-term care, {{in order to}} determine the level of need for long-term care, an <b>examiner</b> visits the <b>applicant</b> to evaluate their actual physical condition. However, the period of evaluation interview is usually limited, and thus assessment of the actual physical condition tends to be difficult. Taking these circumstances into consideration, we designed an ambulatory sensor system aimed at discriminating whether or not a subject uses assistance when standing up from a chair and sitting up in bed during daily activities. The system is composed of two accelerometers, one attached on the subject's chest and the other to the forearm. The chest accelerometer measures the angle in the gravitational direction and up-down motion acceleration. The forearm accelerometer measures the angle in the horizontal direction. In addition the sensor outputs are recorded in a compact data-logger. From experiments using 12 healthy subjects aged from 20 to 50 yrold, the present system could discriminate between the use of assistance (cane, desk and armrest) and no use of assistance when standing up. The periods of sitting up in bed were also detectable and the present system could discriminate between the use of assistance (bed handrail) and no use of assistance. The discriminating accuracy of the system was experimentally evaluated using four healthy subjects (aged 20 yr-old) and two elderly subjects (aged 72 and 73 yr-old). Preliminary experiments of ambulatory monitoring in normal living were also carried out using two elderly subjects (aged 72 and 69 yr-old). The results clearly demonstrated that the new system is able to distinguish with excellent accuracy (> 90 %) between using and not using assistance when standing up and sitting up in bed. We suggest that the system could be a useful means obtaining giving objective information in the procedure of certifying eligibility for long-term care...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge {{transfer}} {{consists of}} activities that aim to capture and transmit knowledge, skills and competence from those who generate them to those who will transform them into socio-economic outcomes. In {{the context of the}} March 2000 Lisbon strategy and its aim to make the European Union the “world's most dynamic and competitive knowledge economy”, knowledge transfer is considered {{to play an important role}} in helping to overcome obstacles such as a weak environment to stimulate high quality research and exploit research results. The introduction of new funding schemes and policies aimed at increasing knowledge flow between countries and sectors in Europe has increased the demand for studies of the impact of such policies and funding mechanisms and the development of relevant and accurate indicators related to them. The aim of this thesis was to study the dynamics of knowledge transfer in Europe and to examine how knowledge transfer can be measured and analysed through different indicators. This was done by studying co-authorships and collaborations within Europe as indicators of geographical knowledge transfer and patent citations as an indicator of sectoral knowledge flow. The results showed that researchers from smaller countries co-authored more with other EU countries than those from bigger countries, while the co-authorship rate with extra-EU partners was not dependent on a country’s size. Co-authorship patterns were also found to depend on the scientific field. The analysis also indicated that multilateral collaborations funded through the EU Framework Programmes are more exclusively European in nature. In contrast, co-publication patterns in multilateral collaborations suggested that European researchers tend to co-author more with global, rather than exclusively European partners and that this global multilateral orientation in copublications continues to rise. When using co-publications as an indicator for geographical knowledge flow, the results demonstrated that European research policy most likely has had an impact on research collaboration patterns. However, the results also strongly suggested that any direct impact was limited and did not over-ride self-selected collaboration patterns that continue to drive a more global, rather than exclusively European, research collaboration orientation. A more disaggregated scrutiny of publication patterns also underscored very clearly that collaboration strategies show considerable diversity across scientific fields, as well as countries. Further, the results suggest that some policies, to support innovation in regions with a low absorptive capacity (weak innovation activities and a low tech profile) e. g. supporting regional R&D through subsidies, may be less successful than the incorporation of qualified personnel at firms or the increase of local university-industry links. The thesis also made several contributions to the discussion of research methods in this field by investigating the utility of some central indicators and approaches. The results showed that the corresponding author is most likely to appear first and thereafter most-likely to appear last in the byline. However, the analysis also indicated that these results are dependent on the number of authors in a paper and that national differences also exist, thus arguing for a fine-tuning of bibliometric tools, in order to more effectively capture the relative importance of author contributions. Similarly, the analysis examined the use of patent citations as an indicator for science-industry links and geographical localization at a regional level. It found that there are reasons to question the use of this indicator, specifically in a region with low absorptive capacity. The related results also highlighted that there is a need to differentiate between <b>applicant</b> and <b>examiner</b> citations when examining the knowledge base since <b>examiners</b> and <b>applicants</b> add different types of knowledge...|$|R
