40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{process planning}} for rapid <b>die</b> <b>tooling.</b> Sheet metal <b>die</b> <b>tooling</b> typically requires long lead times from design to manufacturing. Rapid manufacturing of <b>die</b> <b>tooling</b> {{is a method}} that reduces lead times by minimizing the process planning time. This research focuses on the process planning algorithm for laminated die manufacture to automatically provide adequate interlaminate strength using a minimum number of fasteners. A mechanical model was developed for predicting shear and compressive forces during sheet metal bending was developed as an input to a bolt and dowel pin algorithm. An algorithm is described for proper placement of bolts and dowel pins per each slice layer to satisfy the mechanical model. The impact of this research will allow for proper design to achieve mechanical requirements of <b>die</b> <b>tooling</b> in a rapid manufacturing technology...|$|R

40|$|Formation of spikes {{prevents}} {{achievement of}} the better material removal rate (MRR) and surface finish while using plain NaNO 3 aqueous electrolyte in electrochemical machining (ECM) of <b>die</b> <b>tool</b> steel. Hence this research work attempts to minimize the formation of spikes in the selected workpiece of high carbon high chromium <b>die</b> <b>tool</b> steel using copper nanoparticles suspended in NaNO 3 aqueous electrolyte, that is, nanofluid. The selected influencing parameters are applied voltage and electrolyte discharge rate with three levels and tool feed rate with four levels. Thirty-six experiments were designed using Design Expert 7. 0 software and optimization was done using multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA). This tool identified the best possible combination for achieving the better MRR and surface roughness. The results reveal that voltage of 18 [*]V, tool feed rate of 0. 54 [*]mm/min, and nanofluid discharge rate of 12 [*]lit/min would be the optimum values in ECM of HCHCr <b>die</b> <b>tool</b> steel. For checking the optimality obtained from the MOGA in MATLAB software, the maximum MRR of 375. 78277 [*]mm 3 /min and respective surface roughness Ra of 2. 339779 [*]μm were predicted at applied voltage of 17. 688986 [*]V, tool feed rate of 0. 5399705 [*]mm/min, and nanofluid discharge rate of 11. 998816 [*]lit/min. Confirmatory tests showed that the actual performance at the optimum conditions was 361. 214 [*]mm 3 /min and 2. 41 [*]μm; the deviation from the predicted performance is less than 4 % which proves the composite desirability of the developed models...|$|E

40|$|This study {{addresses}} to the optimization of pultrusion {{manufacturing process}} from the energy-consumption point of view. The die heating system of external platen heaters {{commonly used in}} the pultrusion machines {{is one of the}} components that contribute the most to the high consumption of energy of pultrusion process. Hence, instead of the conventional multi-planar heaters, a new internal die heating system that leads to minor heat losses is proposed. The effect of the number and relative position of the embedded heaters along the die is also analysed towards the setting up of the optimum arrangement that minimizes both the energy rate and consumption. Simulation and optimization processes were greatly supported by Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and calibrated with basis on the temperature profile computed through thermography imaging techniques. The main outputs of this study allow to conclude that the use of embedded cylindrical resistances instead of external planar heaters leads to drastic reductions of both the power consumption and the warm-up periods of the die heating system. For the analysed <b>die</b> <b>tool</b> and process, savings on energy consumption up to 60 % and warm-up period stages less than an half hour were attained with the new internal heating system. The improvements achieved allow reducing the power requirements on pultrusion process, and thus minimize industrial costs and contribute to a more sustainable pultrusion manufacturing industry...|$|E
