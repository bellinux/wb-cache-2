5|$|The black {{wildebeest}} is {{native to}} southern Africa.

5|$|The tuatara was {{featured}} {{on one side}} of the New Zealand five-cent coin, which was phased out in October 2006.

5|$|There {{are many}} cultivars of blackcurrant. 'Baldwin' was the {{mainstay}} of the industry for many years but <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>now</b> largely been superseded by more productive and disease-resistant varieties.

5|$|Collecting {{butterflies}} {{was once}} a popular hobby; <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>now</b> largely been replaced by photography, recording, and rearing butterflies for release into the wild. The zoological illustrator Frederick William Frohawk succeeded in rearing all the butterfly species found in Britain, {{at a rate of}} four per year, to enable him to draw every stage of each species. He published the results in the folio sized handbook The Natural History of British Butterflies in 1924.|$|E
5|$|Sheesh Mahal is flanked {{on either}} side by the Raja Mahal and the Jahangir Mahal.

The interior of this edifice consists of a huge impressive hall with high ceiling, which is the dining hall. Its recent colour scheme renovations are an eyesore. But staying in two of its royal suites on the upper floor, which provide scenic views of the town, gives the guest a feeling of royalty.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} {{generally}} fared badly with human {{change to the}} landscape. Once common on the Cumberland Plain in Sydney's western suburbs, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>now</b> almost disappeared from the Sydney Basin. It has also disappeared from the vicinity of Rockhampton in Queensland, and declined on Rottnest Island, and in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia. Field studies in small patches of remnant vegetation indicate reduced survival rates there.|$|E

5|$|The North End Halifax {{neighbourhood}} of Richmond {{bore the}} brunt of the explosion. In 1917, Richmond was considered a working-class neighbourhood and had few paved roads. After the explosion, the Halifax Relief Commission approached the reconstruction of Richmond as an opportunity to improve and modernize the city's North End. English town planner Thomas Adams and Montreal architectural firm Ross and Macdonald were recruited to design a new housing plan for Richmond. Adams, inspired by the Victorian garden city movement, aimed to provide public access to green spaces and to create a low-rise, low-density and multifunctional urban neighbourhood. The planners designed 326 large homes that each faced a tree-lined, paved boulevard. They specified that the homes be built with a new and innovative fireproof material, blocks of compressed cement called Hydrostone. The first of these homes was occupied by March 1919. Once finished, the Hydrostone neighbourhood consisted of homes, businesses and parks, which helped create a new sense of community in the North End of Halifax. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>now</b> become an upscale neighbourhood and shopping district. In contrast, the equally poor and underdeveloped area of Africville was not included in reconstruction efforts.|$|E
5|$|There {{were three}} schools in Middlewich in the mid-19th century: the British School in Newton Bank; the National School in Cow Lane (Brooks Lane); and the Grammar School, {{close to the}} site of the largest tesco store. A Church of England school was erected in Lewin Street in 1854 and {{extended}} in 1871. It soon became known as the National School, with the result that the earlier school was demolished. The later National School was itself demolished in the 1980s and is the site of the Salinae Day Care Centre, opened in 1995. At the turn of the 20th century two new schools were built: St Mary's Catholic school, whose keystone was laid in 1899 by Col. France-Hayhurst, and the secondary school, opened by France-Hayhurst in 1906. At the start of the 21st century there were seven schools in Middlewich: one infant, one junior, four primary schools and one secondary school. Cledford Primary School tends to accept students from the South of the town. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>now</b> amalgamated With Cledford Infant And Nursery School. Middlewich Primary School caters for children from the older, northern, part of the town, whilst St Mary's Catholic Primary School receives Catholic children from the town. Work began on the original buildings for the secondary school, Middlewich High School, in 1906, with later additions improving the teaching areas and providing a sports hall which could also be used by the wider community. The school opened on 1 November 1906. In 2007 it was ranked 34 out of 50 by GCSE results for schools in Cheshire in the 2007 league tables. Byley Primary School and Wimboldsley Community Primary School serve children from outside the immediate bounds of the town.|$|E
