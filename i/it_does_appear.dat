5|$|The Notitia lists {{a number}} of barbarian {{military}} settlements in the empire. Known as laeti or gentiles ("natives"), these were {{an important source of}} recruits for the army. Groups of Germanic or Sarmatian tribespeople were granted land to settle in the Empire, in return for military service. Most likely each community was under a treaty obligation to supply a specified number of troops to the army each year. The resettlement within the empire of barbarian tribespeople in return for military service was not a new phenomenon in the 4th century: it stretches {{back to the days of}} Augustus. But <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>appear</b> that the establishment of military settlements was more systematic and on a much larger scale in the 4th century.|$|E
5|$|In English, {{achievements}} of arms are usually described (blazoned) in a specialized jargon that uses derivatives of French terms. In Swedish, however, {{achievements of}} arms {{are described in}} relatively plain language, using only Swedish terms and tending to avoid specialized jargon. Examples {{include the use of}} Swedish blå and grön for blue and green, as compared to the French-derived azure and vert used in English blazon. Rather than argent, the Swedish words silver or vit (white) are used, and white, while rare, may be a different color than silver. Purpur (purple) is used in the lining of crowns and in the royal canopy of the greater national coat of arms. Traditionally, purple was rarely used as a tincture on the shield, though <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>appear</b> on the shields of some (especially modern) burgher arms. Ermine likewise appears in the lining of the mantling over the greater national coat of arms, but is otherwise virtually unknown in Swedish heraldry. Vair is also rare in Scandinavian heraldry, and other furs are unknown.|$|E

5|$|The rebels quickly {{extended}} their {{control over the}} neighbouring towns of Venosa, Ascoli, and Lavello. Dokeianos, who had just reimposed order in Bari and the surrounding region, marched to meet them with a hastily assembled and incomplete force: most of the imperial army was still in Sicily, so that Skylitzes writes that Dokeianos only took the Opsician {{and part of the}} Thracesian contingents with him, while other sources also add that his army comprised elements of the Varangian Guard. The two armies met at the Olivento river, where Dokeianos was defeated in a battle fought on 17 March. The rebels then moved south towards the coast, and on 4 May defeated another Byzantine force under Dokeianos in another battle near Cannae, a field that had served as the site for the famous battle of 216 BC and the first Norman engagement in southern Italy in 1018. The Annales Barenses claims, with obvious exaggeration, that 2,000 Normans defeated 18,000 Byzantines, but whatever the true numbers <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>appear</b> that the Byzantines considerably outnumbered the rebel forces. Dokeianos himself fell from his horse during the battle and was almost captured, until rescued by a squire. In the aftermath of the battle, both sides remained quiescent. The Lombards and Normans were probably exhausted and may have suffered heavy casualties, while the Byzantines regrouped: Dokeianos was recalled and replaced by Exaugustus Boioannes, while the garrisons in Sicily were withdrawn to the Italian mainland to face the rebel threat.|$|E

25|$|Books {{constantly}} occur, {{most frequently}} {{in the arms of}} colleges and universities, though the Gospel and Bible are sometimes distinguished. Books if open may be inscribed with words. Words and phrases are otherwise rare, except in Spanish and Portuguese armory. Letters of the various alphabets are also relatively rare. Arms of merchants in Poland and eastern Germany are often based on house marks, abstract symbols resembling runes, though they are almost never blazoned as runes, but as combinations of other heraldic charges. Musical instruments commonly seen are the harp (as in the coat of arms of Ireland), bell and trumpet. The drum, almost without exception, is of the field drum type. Since musical notation is a comparatively recent invention, it is not found in early heraldry, though <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>appear</b> in 20th century heraldry.|$|E
25|$|T. W. Moody {{points out}} that Healy's comment about Davitt missing the train appears to come from A. M.

However, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>appear</b> that Daly and Davitt held differing views of their relative importance to the early land war. Moody {{points out that}} Daly's January 1881 account of the Irishtown meeting in the Connaught Telegraph claiming that Davitt was not involved until the June Westport meeting is untrue; similarly Davitt's July 1882 account left Daly out and claimed he himself was solely responsible, yet he told the 1889 Times-Parnell Commission that he (Davitt) was not responsible; then in his 1904 'Fall of Feudalism', when {{he was free to}} reveal all, he failed to give Daly any due.|$|E
25|$|In {{educational}} psychology, {{qualitative research}} {{is used to}} address questions concerned with developing {{an understanding of the}} meaning and collecting nonnumerical relevant data to gain insights into particular phenomenon. The central to good qualitative research is whether the research participants’ subjective meanings, actions and social contexts, as understood by them, are illuminated. Qualitative logic are for examining patterns across people. It is widely used in educational psychology. Educational psychologists only infrequently drew on qualitative literatures in the past 11 years to design their research studies. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>appear,</b> however, that there has been {{an increase in the number}} of educational psychologists publishing studies using qualitative design frameworks in the past 5 years. On the other hand, it has its weakness as well. Qualitative formats for representing knowledge, such as text, afford insights into a learner’s understanding but are difficult to assemble into summary formats that concisely show a learner’s progress or allow comparisons among learners or across groups. The most fundamental and significant distinction between quantitative research method and qualitative research method is about the data, how the data collected and analyzed. Therefore, this article would be focus on the research methods and how the data collected and analyzed by researchers in qualitative research.|$|E

500|$|Dynamic Motion (1916) for solo piano, written when Cowell was nineteen, {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "probably the first piece anywhere using secundal chords independently for musical extension and variation." [...] Though that is not quite accurate, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>appear</b> to be the first piece to employ chromatic clusters in such a manner. A solo piano piece Cowell wrote the following year, The Tides of Manaunaun (1917), would prove to be his most popular work and the composition most responsible for establishing the tone cluster as a significant element in Western classical music. (Cowell's early piano works are often erroneously dated; in the two cases above, as 1914 and 1912, respectively.) Assumed by some to involve an essentially random—or, more kindly, aleatoric—pianistic approach, Cowell would explain that precision is required in the writing and performance of tone clusters no less than with any other musical feature: ...|$|E
500|$|Thescelosaurs had short, broad, five-fingered hands, four-toed {{feet with}} hoof-like toe tips, {{and a long}} tail braced by ossified tendons from the middle to the tip, which would have reduced the {{flexibility}} of the tail. The rib cage was broad, giving it a wide back, and the limbs were robust. The animals may have been able to move on all fours, given its fairly long arms and wide hands, but this idea has not been widely discussed in the scientific literature, although <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>appear</b> in popular works. Charles M. Sternberg reconstructed it with the upper arm oriented almost perpendicular to the body, another idea that has gone by the wayside. As noted by Peter Galton, the upper arm bone of most ornithischians articulated with the shoulder by an articular surface that consisted of the entire end of the bone, instead of a distinct ball and socket as in mammals. [...] The orientation of the shoulder's articular surface also indicates a vertical and not horizontal upper arm in dinosaurs.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} of the nailed horseshoe enabled longer, faster journeys on horseback, particularly in the wetter lands in northern Europe, and were useful for campaigns on varied terrains. [...] By providing protection and support, nailed horse shoes also improved the efficiency of draught horse teams. [...] Though the Romans had developed an iron [...] "hipposandal" [...] that resembled a hoof boot, there is much debate over the actual origins of the nailed horseshoe, though <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>appear</b> to be of European origin. There is little evidence of nailed-on shoes prior to AD 500 or 600, though there is speculation that the Celtic Gauls {{were the first to}} nail on metal horseshoes. The earliest clear written record of iron horseshoes is a reference to [...] "crescent figured irons and their nails" [...] in a list of cavalry equipment from AD 910. Additional archaeological evidence suggests they were used in Siberia during the 9th and 10th centuries, and had spread to Byzantium soon afterward; by the 11th century, horseshoes were commonly used in Europe. By the time the Crusades began in 1096, horseshoes were widespread and frequently mentioned in various written sources.|$|E

500|$|Devon marched from Exeter to {{encounter}} Bonville at Clyst Heath; {{there are very}} few extant sources for the event, and only one chronicler provides any details, saying he [...] "departed out of the city with his people into the field of Clyst, and there bickered and fought with the Lord Bonville and put them to flight, and so returned again that night into the city." [...] Many bones were discovered when the site was excavated in 1800, although some, Storey points out, must belong to those killed in the [...] 1549 engagement on the same site.

The earl returned to Exeter, where the mayor had [...] "tactfully" [...] laid on a celebration. Hannes Kleineke has described the mayor's decision to illuminate the city walls on the earl's return as [...] "pragmatic", whilst Cherry explains the mayor's behaviour as being due to the fact that the earl, [...] "in his peculiar manner, [...] punctiliously" [...] to the mayor. The earl subsequently sent a sortie led by Thomas Carrew to attack Bonville's manor at Shute where they faced no resistance and pillaged freely, stealing Bonville's cattle, furnishings, and food. The weeks preceding the battle had been accompanied by what has been called [...] "exchange of formal declarations of war disguised in the chivalric mode of challenges to a duel." [...] Michael Hicks has suggested that, in spite of the earl's clear superiority in numbers, it was Bonville who [...] "goaded the earl into a fair fight," [...] and that [...] "in the spirit of chivalry" [...] the confrontation at Clyst was his fault. Cherry too has suggested that Bonville and Courtenay of Powderham deliberately attempted to recruit members of the earl's historical tenantry, further poisoning relations, and also that, although doubtless the earl has deserved the 'universally bad press' he has received from modern historians, he was still [...] "reluctant to go to war," [...] and that he did so [...] "only after all other methods of achieving his aims... had failed." ...|$|E
