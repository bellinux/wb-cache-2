2500|$|Boat 8 {{was loaded}} with 28 people under the {{supervision}} of Second Officer Lightoller and launched at about 1:00a.m., with Captain Smith and Chief Officer Wilde participating. Boat 8 was the first lifeboat on the port side to be lowered. Ida Straus, wife of New York merchant Isidor Straus, was asked to join a group of people preparing to board but refused, saying, [...] "I will not be separated from my husband. As we have lived, so will we die– together." [...] The 67-year-old Isidor likewise refused an offer to board on account of his age, saying: [...] "I do not wish any distinction in my favor which is not granted to others." [...] They were last seen alive on deck arm in arm. Major Archibald Butt, military aide to US President William Howard Taft, escorted to the boat Marie Young, a former music teacher to the children of President Theodore Roosevelt. She later recalled he [...] "wrapped blankets about me and tucked me in as carefully as if we were going on a motor ride." [...] He wished her farewell and good luck, asking her to [...] "remember me to the <b>folks</b> <b>back</b> home." [...] Other single women were brought to the boats by men who had earlier offered their services to [...] "unprotected ladies," [...] as the conventions of the era dictated.|$|E

25|$|Argentine {{folk music}} is uniquely vast. Beyond dozens of {{regional}} dances, a national folk style {{emerged in the}} 1930s. Perón's Argentina would give rise to Nueva Canción, as artists began expressing in their music objections to political themes. Atahualpa Yupanqui, the greatest Argentine folk musician, and Mercedes Sosa would be defining figures in shaping Nueva Canción, gaining worldwide popularity in the process. The style found a huge reception in Chile, where it took off in the 1970s, {{and went on to}} influence the entirety of Latin American music. Today, Chango Spasiuk and Soledad Pastorutti have brought <b>folk</b> <b>back</b> to younger generations. León Gieco's folk-rock bridged the gap between Argentine folklore and Argentine rock, introducing both styles to millions overseas in successive tours.|$|R
60|$|It was a clean {{mile from}} the pit of the Sunlanders, and death had spanned it. A great cry of rage went up, and in it there was much of blood-vengeance, much of the unreasoned ferocity of the brute. Tyee and Aab-Waak tried to hold the Mandell <b>Folk</b> <b>back,</b> were thrust aside, and could only turn and watch the mad charge. But no shots came from the Sunlanders, and ere half the {{distance}} was covered, many, affrighted by the mysterious silence of the pit, halted and waited. The wilder spirits bore on, and when they had cut the remaining distance in half, the pit still {{showed no sign of}} life. At two hundred yards they slowed down and bunched; at one hundred, they stopped, a score of them, suspicious, and conferred together.|$|R
