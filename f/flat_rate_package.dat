40|$|Since its {{establishment}} in 1992, NTT DoCoMo had accomplished rapid growth by developing innovative strategies and meeting consumer demands. However, the population-based penetration rate of Japanese wireless phones now exceeds 70 %, {{and the market}} is approaching saturation. Tariff reduction battles have occurred among competitors since the introduction of <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>packages</b> in 2004. Furthermore, this competitive environment {{will become even more}} fierce with the introduction of Mobile Number Portability and the addition of new entrants It is difficult for Japanese wireless telecom operators to achieve sustainable growth if they continue to follow existing business models. DoCoMo therefore has begun to implement a new business platform, 'Mobile Wallet' on which DoCoMo aims to build an unprecedented business model-the fusion of its credit card and wireless phone businesses. DoCoMo still generates a high level of cash flow from its existing businesses, even though its growth rate has decelerated. In addition to the new strategy that has been implemented for the domestic market, I believe DoCoMo should reinvest its abundant investment resources effectively into markets with high growth potential in order to increase the company's corporate growth. (cont.) In the past, DoCoMo acquired a minority stake in several wireless telecom operators in developed countries for the purpose of expanding its W-CDMA and i-mode platforms (developed by DoCoMo) but not for pursuing returns on its investment. In contrast, Vodafone, DoCoMo's chief rival telecom operator, acquired a majority stake in several wireless telecom operators in order to expand the scope and scale of its business and to pursue synergy effects. DoCoMo's present basic strategy can be defined as a technology-driven policy, while Vodafone's basic strategy focuses on financial matters as a finance-driven policy. In this thesis, I analyze the global strategies of these two wireless telecom operators, comparing their respective technology-driven policy and finance-driven policy. I present a philosophy and methodology for a global investment strategy that will creates future sustainable growth for DoCoMo. Finally, I examine specific investment candidates who could bolster the implementation of the new strategy. by Osamu Matsuda. Thesis (M. B. A.)

3000|$|We {{find that}} cost cap tariffs {{should never be}} chosen over {{pay-per-use}} or <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> plans if consumers are certain about their preferences and consequently in their demand. In this case, the cost cap tariff is always dominated by either the pay-per-use plan or the <b>flat</b> <b>rate.</b> However, if consumers have uncertainty in their preferences, the cost cap tariff may generate a higher (expected) consumer surplus than a pay-per-use plan or a <b>flat</b> <b>rate.</b> This holds true even though consumers are charged more at the margin than in a pay-per-use tariff and the maximum possible bill amount is higher under a cost cap compared to a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> tariff. This is because the cost cap tariff does not only provide cost insurance in case of high demand (like a <b>flat</b> <b>rate),</b> but also cost flexibility in case of low demand (like a pay-per-use tariff). The main research questions that are addressed are (1) under which conditions are cost cap tariffs potentially chosen (over pay-per-use plans and <b>flat</b> <b>rates)?</b> and (2) what {{is the impact of}} demand uncertainty on tariff choice?

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to give insights into the production, income and environmental effects of the introduction of a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> for Dutch agriculture that is lower than the present average direct income payment. For this purpose, a detailed agri-environmental programming model for Dutch agriculture is used. Results of a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> scenario are compared to a reference scenario comparing agricultural production in the Netherlands in 2020 in a situation without a <b>flat</b> <b>rate.</b> Results show that total gross margin in Dutch agriculture decreases because of the <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> with 7 %. The supply of starch potatoes and cow milk decreases most. Production of seed and consumption potatoes, vegetables and intensive livestock products increases slightly. This is largely due to a shift of farm payments from milk and starch potatoes production to arable crops and vegetable production. It was found that including risk aversion of income volatility amplifies these effects. In the <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> scenario total emissions of nutrients from agricultural production to the environment decreases...|$|R

We create a Bertrand duopoly game model with different pricing schemes: One ISP with <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> pricing for its QoS service and the other ISP with two part tariff, a combined pricing scheme with <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> and usage-sensitive pricing. Based on industry survey data, we conduct a simulation of a random number generation method for consumer demand and Internet access hours. Then, we find an equilibrium point of pricing strategy where an ISP with <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> pricing has higher profit than an ISP with a two-part tariff. Finally, we present an analytical framework for the future QoS Internet pricing strategy. 1...|$|R

Possibly, consumers in our model prefer a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> to a measured tariff, even though this choice does not minimize their expected billing amount - a behavior in line with ample empirical evidence. We solve for the profit-maximizing two-part tariff, which is a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> if (a) marginal costs are not too high, (b) loss aversion is intense, and (c) there are strong variations in demand. Moreover, we analyze the optimal nonlinear tariff. This tariff has a large flat part when a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> is optimal among the class of two-part tariffs...|$|R
