40|$|The {{occurrence}} {{and impact}} of chlamydial <b>infections</b> <b>in</b> Western livestock is well documented in the international literature, but less is known about these <b>infections</b> <b>in</b> livestock in the People's Republic of China. China's livestock production and its share in the global market have increased significantly in recent decades. In this review, the relevant English and Chinese literature on the epidemiology of chlamydial <b>infections</b> <b>in</b> Chinese livestock is considered, and biosecurity measures, prophylaxis and treatment of these <b>infections</b> <b>in</b> China's livestock are compared with Western practices. Chlamydial infections are highly prevalent in Chinese livestock and cause important economic losses, {{as they do in}} the rest of the world. Surveillance data and diagnostic results of abortion outbreaks in cattle, sheep and goats highlight the importance of virulent chlamydial <b>infections</b> <b>in</b> China's major ruminant species in many of China's provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities. Data from many of China's provincial divisions also indicate the widespread presence of chlamydial <b>infections</b> <b>in</b> industrially reared swine across the country. Less is known about chlamydial <b>infections</b> <b>in</b> yak, buffalo and horses, but available reports indicate a high prevalence in China's populations. In these reports, chlamydiosis was related to abortions in yak and pneumonia in horses. In Western countries, chlamydial infections are principally treated with antibiotics.
