25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Michael Taylor {{believes}} that Shakespeare almost certainly wrote the entire play, as does J. J. M. Tobin, who, {{in his essay}} in Henry VI: Critical Essays (2001), argues the similarities to Nashe do not reveal the hand of Nashe {{at work in the}} composition of the play, but instead reveal Shakespeare imitating Nashe. More recently, in 2005, Paul J. Vincent has re-examined the question <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>recent</b> research into the Elizabethan theatre, concluding that 1 Henry VI is Shakespeare's partial revision of a play by Nashe (Act 1) and an unknown playwright (Acts 2–5) and that it was the original, non-Shakespearean, play that was first performed on 3 March 1592. Shakespeare's work in the play, which was most likely composed in 1594, can be found in Act 2 (scene 4) and Act 4 (scenes 2–5 and the first 32 lines of scene 7). In 2007, Vincent's authorship findings, especially with regard to Nashe's authorship of Act 1, were supported overall by Brian Vickers, who agrees with the theory of co-authorship and differs only slightly over the extent of Shakespeare's contribution to the play.|$|E
500|$|Discussion {{that led}} to the {{creation}} of the series began in the summer of 2002. Ron Howard had the original idea to create a comedy series in the style of handheld cameras and reality television, but with an elaborate, highly comical script resulting from repeated rewritings and rehearsals. Howard met with David Nevins, the President of Imagine Television, Katie O'Connell, a senior vice president, and two writers, including Mitchell Hurwitz. <b>In</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>recent</b> corporate accounting scandals, such as Enron and Adelphia, Hurwitz suggested a story about a [...] "riches to rags" [...] family. Howard and Imagine were immediately interested in using this idea, and signed Hurwitz to write the show. The idea was pitched and sold in the fall of 2002. There was a bidding war for the show between Fox and NBC, with the show ultimately selling to Fox as a put pilot with a six-figure penalty.|$|E

500|$|Bogaert {{argues that}} {{understanding}} asexuality is of key importance to understanding sexuality in general. For his work, Bogaert defines asexuality as [...] "a lack of lustful inclinations/feelings directed toward others," [...] a definition that he argues {{is relatively new}} <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>recent</b> theory and empirical work on sexual orientation. This definition of asexuality also makes clear this distinction between behavior and desire, for both asexuality and celibacy, although Bogaert also notes {{that there is some}} evidence of reduced sexual activity for those who fit this definition. He further distinguishes between desire for others and desire for sexual stimulation, the latter of which is not always absent for those who identify as asexual, although he acknowledges that other theorists define asexuality differently and that further research needs to be done on the [...] "complex relationship between attraction and desire". Another distinction is made between romantic and sexual attraction, and he draws on work from developmental psychology, which suggests that romantic systems derive from attachment theory while sexual systems [...] "primarily reside in different brain structures".|$|E
500|$|<b>In</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>recent</b> findings, in 2007, the IUCN reassessed {{the silky}} shark from Least Concern to Near Threatened worldwide. Regionally, it {{is listed as}} Near Threatened in the southwestern Atlantic, Indian Ocean, and western central Pacific, and as Vulnerable in the eastern central and southeastern Pacific and the northwestern and western central Atlantic. The silky shark is listed on Annex I, Highly Migratory Species, of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, though this has yet to result in any {{management}} schemes. The species should benefit from bans on shark finning, which are being increasingly implemented by nations and supranational entities, including the United States, Australia, and the European Union. Organizations such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas [...] and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission [...] have also taken steps to improve fishery monitoring, with {{the ultimate goal of}} reducing shark bycatch. However, given the highly migratory nature of the silky shark and its association with tuna, no simple way is known to reduce bycatch without also affecting the economics of the fishery.|$|E
500|$|Scholars {{have long}} noted Shakespeare's {{widespread}} use {{of light and dark}} imagery throughout the play. Caroline Spurgeon considers the theme of light as [...] "symbolic of the natural beauty of young love" [...] and later critics have expanded on this interpretation. For example, both Romeo and Juliet see the other as light in a surrounding darkness. Romeo describes Juliet as being like the sun, brighter than a torch, a jewel sparkling in the night, and a bright angel among dark clouds. Even when she lies apparently dead in the tomb, he says her [...] "beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light." [...] Juliet describes Romeo as [...] "day in night" [...] and [...] "Whiter than snow upon a raven's back." [...] This contrast of light and dark can be expanded as symbols—contrasting love and hate, youth and age in a metaphoric way. Sometimes these intertwining metaphors create dramatic irony. For example, Romeo and Juliet's love is a light {{in the midst of the}} darkness of the hate around them, but all of their activity together is done in night and darkness while all of the feuding is done in broad daylight. This paradox of imagery adds atmosphere to the moral dilemma facing the two lovers: loyalty to family or loyalty to love. At the end of the story, when the morning is gloomy and the sun hiding its face for sorrow, light and dark have returned to their proper places, the outward darkness reflecting the true, inner darkness of the family feud out of sorrow for the lovers. All characters now recognise their folly <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>recent</b> events, and things return to the natural order, thanks to the love and death of Romeo and Juliet. The [...] "light" [...] theme in the play is also heavily connected to the theme of time since light was a convenient way for Shakespeare to express the passage of time through descriptions of the sun, moon, and stars.|$|E
