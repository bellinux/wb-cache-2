40|$|Femtosecond laser pulses {{were used}} for the direct point-by-point {{inscription}} of phase-shifted fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) in a single fabrication step without postprocessing. An electro-optic amplitude modulator is used in the setup to generate a defined delay between two identical laser pulse trains for the grating inscription. The grating structure with a central phase shift is formed by focusing the modulated laser pulses into the core of a fiber, while the fiber is translated with a constant velocity. The induced phase shift leads to a narrow transmission band with a bandwidth considerably below 10 pm within the stop band of the FBG. The inscribed FBGs show a birefringence of 3. 9 x 10 (- 5) whereas their temperature and strain sensitivities are 10. 4 pm/K and 1. 4 pm/mu strain, respectively.

40|$|This {{research}} is providing methodologies {{to enhance the}} design phase from architectural space exploration and system study to verification of the whole mixed-signal system. At {{the beginning of the}} work, some innovative digital IPs have been designed to develop efficient signal conditioning for sensor systems on-chip that has been included in commercial products. After this phase, the main focus has been addressed {{to the creation of a}} re-usable and versatile test of the device after the tape-out which is close to become one of the major cost factor for ICs companies, strongly linking it to model’s test-benches to avoid re-design phases and multi-environment scenarios, producing a very effective approach to a single, fast and reliable multi-level verification environment. All these works generated different publications in scientific literature. The compound scenario concerning the development of sensor systems is presented in Chapter 1, together with an overview of the related market with a particular focus on the latest MEMS and MOEMS technology devices, and their applications in various segments. Chapter 2 introduces the state of the art for sensor interfaces: the generic sensor interface concept (based on sharing the same electronics among similar applications achieving cost saving at the expense of area and performance loss) versus the Platform Based Design methodology, which overcomes the drawbacks of the classic solution by keeping the generality at the highest design layers and customizing the platform for a target sensor achieving optimized performances. An evolution of Platform Based Design achieved by implementation into silicon of the ISIF (Intelligent Sensor InterFace) platform is therefore presented. ISIF is a highly configurable mixed-signal chip which allows designers to perform an effective design space exploration and to evaluate directly on silicon the system performances avoiding the critical and time consuming analysis required by standard platform based approach. In chapter 3 we describe the design of a smart sensor interface for conditioning next generation MOEMS. The adoption of a new, high performance and high integrated technology allow us to integrate not only a versatile platform but also a powerful ARM processor and various IPs providing the possibility to use the platform not only as a conditioning platform but also as a processing unit for the application. In this chapter a description of the various blocks is given, with a particular emphasis on the IP developed in order to grant the highest <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> with the minimum area occupation. The architectural space evaluation and the application prototyping with ISIF has enabled an effective, rapid and low risk development of a new high performance platform achieving a flexible sensor system for MEMS and MOEMS monitoring and conditioning. The platform has been design to cover very challenging test-benches, like a laser-based projector device. In this way the platform will not only be able to effectively handle the sensor but also all the system that can be built around it, reducing the needed for further electronics and resulting in an efficient test bench for the algorithm developed to drive the system. The high costs in ASIC development are mainly related to re-design phases because of missing complete top-level tests. Analog and digital parts design flows are separately verified. Starting from these considerations, in the last chapter a complete test environment for complex mixed-signal chips is presented. A semi-automatic VHDL-AMS flow to provide totally matching top-level is described and then, an evolution for fast self-checking test development for both model and real chip verification is proposed. By the introduction of a Python interface, the designer can easily perform interactive tests to cover all the features verification (e. g. calibration and trimming) into the design phase and check them all with the same environment on the real chip after the tape-out. This strategy has been tested on a consumer 3 D-gyro for consumer application, in collaboration with SensorDynamics AG...|$|E
40|$|Shannon’s {{source and}} channel-coding {{separation}} theorem {{has been the}} basic philosophy followed by most state-of-the-art wireless transceivers, where all source signals are assumed {{to have the same}} importance and are protected equally by the channel encoder. However, due to its assumption of using idealized Gaussian channels, potentially infinite encoding/decoding delay as well as complexity, Shannon’s source and channel-coding theorem is not strictly applicable in practical wireless scenarios. This is because {{it is almost impossible to}} remove all the redundancy of the video source, therefore there exits a certain amount of residual correlation. Moreover, reallife applications are often required to transmit source signals associated with unequal importance, such as the base-layer and enhancement-layer of layered video codecs. Hence joint source-channel coding (JSCC) was proposed for wireless scenarios by jointly exploiting the residual redundancy of the video source and the intentionally imposed redundancy of unequal error protection (UEP) techniques. A video codec suitable for lossless video compression and iterative source-channel decoding (ISCD) is proposed by further developing the Markov random field (MRF) soft source decoder for the transmission of video sequences, rather than still video pictures. More explicitly, we used low complexity frame-differencing (FD) for removing the temporal-domain inter-frame redundancy. The low-complexity FD technique does not rely on power-thirsty motion-vector-based motion-compensation and as its other benefit, it does not require the transmission of motion vectors. However, this results in more residual redundancy than the more complex motion-vector based motion-compensation. Furthermore, variable-length code (VrLC) is used for removing the residual spatial redundancy of the FD signal, while exploiting the correlations amongst the FD pixels within the current frame with the aid of our MRF model based soft-in-soft-out (SISO) module. By adopting the MRF for modelling of the video pixels, we can infer maximum a posteriori (MAP) image estimates from the 2 -D spatial redundancy between the video pixels, while simpler models like the Markov chain can only explore the 1 -D spatial redundancy. Although the estimation of the MRF parameters is a challenge compared to the 1 -D Markov models, we conceived novel extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) -chart-based estimation methods, which are shown to be effective. Moreover, a novel three-stage ISCD structure is proposed, which outperforms the two-stage architecture. Furthermore, we examined the convergence of the three-stage iterative decoding process using 3 D EXIT charts. The performance of our system operating both with and without FD is compared to our benchmarker schemes. In support of inter-layer forward error correction (IL-FEC) coded layered video transmission, we conceived an adaptive truncated HARQ (ATHARQ) scheme for minimizing the video distortion under the constraint of a given total number of transmission time slots. More specifically, we investigated the merits of IL-FEC schemes in the context of truncated HARQ (THARQ) transmission schemes, where the packet scheduling arrangements were carefully designed for exploiting the specific characteristics of each IL-FEC coded packet. Furthermore, we developed a method of on-line optimization for our IL-ATHARQ transmission scheme, in order to find the most appropriate FEC code rate distribution among the video layers that reduced the video distortion. Type-I HARQ relying on Convolutional Codes (CC) was used for simplicity, because our focus was on the design of the scheduling schemes. The performance of our IL-ATHARQ scheme as well as of the rate-optimized IL-ATHARQ scheme using a RSC codec were compared to the benchmarkers using different video sequences, followed by characterizing both the effects of the delay as well as of the channel quality prediction errors on the attainable system performance. Finally, we conceived an UEP scheme for layered video transmission in the downlink of a visible light communication system, explicitly, we proposed a hierarchical colour-shift keying (HCSK) modulation scheme based on the standardized colourshift keying (CSK), which is capable of conveying inter-dependent layers of video signals. More specifically, we proposed the Type I and Type II HCSK arrangements, which can be flexibly configured by according to the channel quality, video quality, etc., where the Type II constellation allows us to use a wider range of FERs for the higher layers upon varying the constellation-shaping parameter dl. Our simulation results show that Type II HCSK provides a high <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> in terms of both its system configuration and optimization. Furthermore, we provided a detailed design example for the employment of HCSK transmitting scalable video sources with the aid of a RSC code. An optimisation method was conceived in order to enhance the UEP and to improve the quality of the received video. The performance of our optimised M-HCSK-RSC video transmission system using different HCSK constellation sizes was compared to the relevant benchmarker schemes using different video sequences...|$|E

40|$|The enterprise-customer {{relationships}} {{analysis is}} one of the most important themes in marketing literature (Dwyer, Schurr, Oh, 1987; Morgan, Hunt 1994; Gummesson, 1999), particularly referring to the role that these relationships have in obtaining a competitive advantage (Dyer, Sing, 1998; Morgan, Hunt, 1999; Vicari, Bertoli, Busacca, 2000). Among the various changes occurred the last decades, technological development was the one that, without doubt, determined, referring to the enterprise-customer relationships, the most significant modifications (Varaldo, 2004), showing to enterprises the importance of building competitive strategies focused on every single costumer (Peppers, Rogers 1999; Rust Zeithaml, Lemon, 2000; Vandenbosch, Dawar, 2002; Vandermerwe, 2004; Gulati, Oldroyd, 2005; Rogers, 2005). From such first considerations evidently appears that the evolutionary dynamics in progress lifts new questions in the conceptualization, in the analysis and in the management of the enterprise-costumer relationships (Pettinao, 2007), causing that the management of such relationships becomes a critical factor of success in hypercompetitives contexts (D’Aveni, 1994) as that actual, characterized by an ample variety and variability of problems and market demands as well as from a strong tension toward the innovation of the offering system. At the same time, the adoption of the IT technologies {{is one of}} the factors that determined the greatest changes with reference to the organizational relationships (Moss Kanter, 2001; Afuah, Tucci, Virili, 2001; Pontiggia 1997) making possible such kinds of interactions first unimaginable (Kelly, 1998). On the organizational point of view Boyton et al. (1993) noticed as the advent of mass personalization set the accent on the necessity to assume productive unities coordination models based on loosed coupled (Weick, 1976) that conferred to the structure a certain <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> and the possibility to quickly coordinate itself with the market demands assisting the generation of new forms of organizational learning (Albertini, 1990; Ferrero, 2000). Following these lines of reflection, clearly appears that the possibilities for an enterprise to survive and develop itself could be as greater as more profitable and intense are the relationships that it establishes both with the present remarkable other system in the environment (Golinelli, 2000) and with her subsystems (Usai, 2002). Considering these observations, with the present paper we propose ourselves to delineate a possible key reading in terms of expansion and evolution of the enterprise-costumer relationships. The goal is to explore the possibility of application of the sensemaking (Weick, 1969, 1995) studies to the analysis of the enterprise-costumer relationships and to verify the support that IT technologies can offer to the creation of a dialogue space with the client. The application of the sensemaking presuppositions requires, however, to attribute a particular importance not only to the IT technologies use but also to the existence of some important organizational requisite as the knowledge, the identification and the organizational integration. The analysis is conducted with reference to a specific sector and, specifically, to the financial intermediation one. Such choice is particularly important because, although many studies have been conducted regarding different aspects of the business banking, the close examination of the impact that IT technologies can have on this sector starts only at the end of 1990 (Devil, 1995; Buhl, Will, 1998; Yan, Paradi, 1998; Liao, Cheung, 2002; Scruggs, 2002; King, Liou, 2004; Yousafzadi, Pallister, Foxall, 2005). For a long time, in fact, the majority of the banks only made small adjustments of their own operational and managerial formalities without modifying them in a remarkable way (Dematté 1997). Nevertheless, currently the extreme competition, the glut of the financial markets and the increasing answer of products and services through the new technologies pushed the banks to quickly modify their own models of business (Methlie, Nysveen, 1999; Jun, Cai, 2001; Bradley, Stewart, 2003) and differentiate their own organization in function of the final costumer. With the creation of “markets” (corporate, retail, private banking) a lot of banks intended to give diversified solutions to diversified need, modifying the old strategy hinged on the product “omni-comprehensive”. This is coherent with the statement that the costumers don’t look for generics goods or services but for solutions that, resolving their problems, (Levitt 1983) allows them to create value (Gronroos 2002). The study of products designed to specific markets involves the management of a multiplicity of distributive channels and sets the banks in the condition to elaborate precise politics to assure the harmonious coexistence among the different structures preceded to the direct relationship with the costumers (De Marco, Sorrentino, 1999). This paper brings theory and practice together by synthesising the existing literature with real-life experience of an Italian bank. The aim is that to tie the indications that results from the marketing studies regarding the evolution assumed by the enterprise-client relationships with those inferred by the organizational studies regarding the inside relationships management and the increasing importance assumed by the human subjects in the organizational trials. Two principal questions motivate the search. In first place we try to verify the strength use of the IT technologies to the enterprise-costumer relationships support and consolidation in the financial intermediation sector. Hereafter, we want to investigate on the organizational factors that makes efficient and competitive the banking use of IT technologies. The investigation is conducted with specific reference to the Corporate segment, which the existing searches on are, without doubt, extremely inferior in comparison to those about the Retail segment, that constitutes the prevailing area of the national banking activity. A case study research approach was used (Yin, 1994; Dubois, Gadde 2002) to investigate marketing and organizational factor in Corporate e-banking. This methodology is particularly proper to develop the theory through the deep comprehension of the empirical phenomena and the context in which they take place...|$|E

Keeping the profit margin at the same rate at the forced contraction of output, because of the negative impact of external factors, will confirm that the organization has adapted to the external environment and, therefore, it is flexible.

On the basis of these results the authors concluded that trained gymnastic exercises for the students represent complex motor tasks and as such require physical preparation which is mostly related to the increase in the level of general and explosive strength (especially in girls), and increased level <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> (especially in boys) ...|$|R

40|$|In {{their attempt}} to improve their systems and architectures, {{organizations}} {{need to be aware}} of the types <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> and agility and the current level of each type <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> and agility. Flexibility is the general ability to react to changes, whilst agility is the speed in responding to variety and changes Both flexibility and agility are diverse concepts that are hard to grasp. In this paper the types <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> and agility <b>of</b> business processes is discussed on a foundation level and an approach to measure the level <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> and agility is proposed. A case study <b>of</b> the <b>flexibility</b> and agility measurement is used to demonstrate the approach. The illustration is used to discuss the difficulties and limitations of the measurement approach. There is no uniform definition of or view on flexibility and agility. This makes it hard to develop a measurement approach. Furthermore, as business processes can be different, this might result in different metrics for measuring the level <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> and agility. There is no single measure and for each type of business process and flexibility and agility should always measure by a combination of metrics. In addition, both qualitative and quantitative metrics should be used to measure the level <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> and agility...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Sequencing {{flexibility}} {{refers to}} the possibility of interchanging the order in which required manufacturing operations are performed. In this paper, we address several issues related to the modeling, measurement and performance evaluation <b>of</b> this <b>flexibility</b> in manufacturing systems. In particular, we introduce several representation and measurement schemes for sequencing flexibility and discuss the usefulness and limitations of each. We then propose a new performance-based approach for quantifying the value <b>of</b> <b>flexibility.</b> To this effect, we study the relationship between flexibility and system performance under a variety of design assumptions and operating conditions. These relationships are used to identify key characteristics of a measure <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> that is reflective of system performance. This measure is to allow system designers and managers to predict performance based on existing levels <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> and/or determine the amount <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> required to achieve a certain level of performance. This measure is shown to be easier to calculate than traditional performance measures and to be possible to use as a substitute for these measures in estimating the effect <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> on performance...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{the subject}} of the {{research}} is only one segment of the anthropological area, which refers to the appearance of appropriate motor abilities- flexibility. Flexibility is responsible to perform a movement to get her whit other motor abilities. It appears like ability to perform a movement with maximum amplitude. It is conditional with bone- joint system, it is a backward area of human body. The appropriate level <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> is necessary during each motor activity. Size and character <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> depend mostly on a kind of activity and on forms of the specific ability demonstration, when specific branch or discipline is concerned. The battery for the evaluation <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> consists <b>of</b> the following tests: MDPK, MISK, MBŠP. During the 2005 / 06 academic year, a research was conducted so as {{to determine the effects of}} current program of physical education teaching on motor abilities <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> female pupils. The research involved a total sample of 107 girls from the 3 th and 4 th <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> elementary school. The subjects were classified in experimental and control groups. The experimental group was made of 59 students and they were practicing according to planning instruction where the artistic gymnastics had the primary part. The control group of 48 students was practicing according to official instructional plan and program for P. E. of the Republic of Serbia. At the beginning of the academic year, initial (first) measurement was performed, followed by experimental final (second) measurement at the end of experiment. Research data was processed using SPSS standard statistics procedure. The multi-variant procedures were used in this research ant those were: the multi-variant analysis of the variable (MANOVA) and the discriminative analysis. Also, the mono-variant procedures were used and those were: the variable analysis (ANOVA) and the interval of entrust. After the experimental treatment, i. e. at the final testing, significant differences were found with female pupils in experimental and control groups concerning the all tests for the evaluation <b>of</b> <b>flexibility.</b> The basic conclusion is that the female pupils of experimental group achieved significantly higher teaching effects than the control group, in view of partly increased motor abilities, being the result of the effects of the experimental treatment, as well as other external and internal factors...|$|R
