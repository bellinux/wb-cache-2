He chases Sunny through the crowd at a cricket stadium where India and Pakistan are playing a {{friendly}} match. Sameer breaks through security, takes the microphone from guest of honour Kapil Dev and apologises to Rani and her parents. He asks her to marry him in front of the crowd, and Rani runs onto the field and embraces him, thus reuniting with him.|$|E
5|$|The Bulldogs were {{scheduled}} to play their second game against the Rochester Jeffersons, but faced the Toledo Maroons after that match was cancelled. For the second game in a row the Bulldogs scored over 40 points in a shutout as Martin and Guyon dominated on offense. Martin scored the first touchdown of {{the game with a}} run in the first quarter. In the second quarter, Hendren scored a rushing touchdown, and end Tom Whelan caught a touchdown pass from Grigg. In the third quarter, Martin caught a touchdown pass from Grigg, and Grigg rushed for another. The Bulldogs' final score was a rushing touchdown from back Pete Calac in the fourth quarter. The final score was 48–0. The Maroons never <b>got</b> <b>close</b> to scoring and did not make a single a first down.|$|E
5|$|In late August, Montgomery sailed {{north from}} Fort Ticonderoga with about 1,200 men. After {{successfully}} besieging Fort Saint-Jean, he captured Montreal on November 13. The two men joined forces in early December, {{and with their}} combined force of about 1,200 soldiers, they attacked Quebec on December 31, 1775. The colonial forces suffered a disastrous defeat {{at the hands of}} General Guy Carleton, governor of Quebec and commander of the British forces. Montgomery was killed leading an assault along with all but one of his officers; his men never <b>got</b> <b>close</b> to the walls. Arnold's force made a descent into the lower town. Early in the battle, Arnold was wounded in the leg, but stayed on the battlefield encouraging his troops on. Daniel Morgan's rifle company, the most successful of the American troops, fought inside the city until Morgan was cornered and forced to surrender. Many others were killed or wounded, and hundreds were taken prisoner.|$|E

5|$|In the army, Nurmi quickly {{impressed}} in {{the athletic}} competitions: While others marched, Nurmi ran the whole distances with a rifle {{on his shoulder and}} a backpack full of sand. Nurmi's stubbornness caused him difficulties with his non-commissioned officers, but he was favoured by the superior officers, despite his refusal to take the soldier's oath. As the unit commander Hugo Österman was a known sports aficionado, Nurmi and few other athletes were given free time to practice. Nurmi improvised new training methods in the army barracks; he ran behind trains, holding on to the rear bumper, to stretch his stride, and used heavy iron-clad army boots to strengthen his legs. Nurmi soon began setting personal bests and <b>got</b> <b>close</b> for the Olympic selection. In March 1920, he was promoted to corporal (alikersantti). On 29 May 1920, he set his first national record on the 3000 m and {{went on to win the}} 1500 m and the 5000 m at the Olympic trials in July.|$|E
5|$|Lexington was at sea {{when the}} Pacific War began on 7 December 1941, {{ferrying}} fighter aircraft to Midway Island. Her mission was cancelled and {{she returned to}} Pearl Harbor a week later. After a few days, she was sent to create a diversion from the force en route to relieve the besieged Wake Island garrison by attacking Japanese installations in the Marshall Islands. The island was forced to surrender before the relief force <b>got</b> <b>close</b> enough, and the mission was cancelled. A planned attack on Wake Island in January 1942 had to be cancelled when a submarine sank the oiler required to supply the fuel for the return trip. Lexington {{was sent to the}} Coral Sea the following month to block any Japanese advances into the area. The ship was spotted by Japanese search aircraft while approaching Rabaul, New Britain, and her aircraft shot down most of the Japanese bombers that attacked her. Together with the carrier , she successfully attacked Japanese shipping off the east coast of New Guinea in early March.|$|E
5|$|At 14:45, {{covered by}} an {{artillery}} barrage and machine-gun fire, the Turkish troops counter-attacked again. The regiment's machine gunners returned fire {{and for a}} short time the battle became a machine-gun engagement. During this time the Wellington Mounted Rifles, to the right, had occupied a prominent hill, but were under heavy fire. To support them, the 3rd Squadron sent two troops to engage their opponents, which they caught {{in the bottom of a}} valley, with enfilade fire. Then in front of the regiment a fresh Turkish battalion was sent to assault them. In some places, the Turkish force <b>got</b> <b>close</b> enough to throw hand grenades into the regiment's defences. These killed or wounded all those defending a small hill, which was then occupied by the Turkish troops, bringing indirect fire onto the rest of the regiment's positions, which by now were becoming untenable. At first, messengers sent to the 4th Squadron asking for assistance failed to get through. Eventually the squadron received the message and charged across the open ground, recapturing the hill. This brought the rest of the Turkish line into range of the squadron's guns. Confronted by the new threat, the Turkish troops retired back to their starting point. McCarroll was ordering a regiment attack on the orange grove when he was wounded in the neck and shoulder, forcing Major Henry Whitehorn to assume temporary command of the regiment. By then it was getting dark and the only Turkish offensive action was an artillery bombardment. Instead of attacking, the regiment spent the rest of the day evacuating the wounded and strengthening their lines. Their casualties during the battle were fifteen dead and seventy-four wounded. The next morning it was discovered that Ayun Kara had been evacuated by the Turkish troops.|$|E

5|$|In August 1979, Atari {{produced}} an arcade game {{version of the}} concept called Lunar Lander. This version featured monochrome vector graphics and allowed the player to rotate the ship right or left and fire thrusters controlled with a proportional throttle control system using a joystick with a spring. Like Moonlander, both a graphical display of a repeating mountainous surface {{as well as a}} text readout of the ship's speed, altitude, and remaining fuel are displayed. Once a game begins, it only ends when a player runs out of fuel, rather than due to a time limit; players can insert quarters to add fuel to their current game. Bonus points are awarded for landing on difficult parts of the map. The game features four levels of difficulty in controlling the ship. Lunar Lander was Atari's first vector graphics game and the first multiple-perspective video game; when the lander <b>got</b> <b>close</b> to the surface, the view changed to a close-up view of the lander. The vector engine was inspired by Space Wars (1978) and created by Rick Moncrief and Howard Delman, who developed Lunar Lander alongside Rich Moore. The idea for the game came from Delman, who had seen a graphical version of the game, likely Moonlander, a few years prior. At least one other arcade game based on the Lunar Lander concept was developed around the same time, Lunar Rescue by Taito.|$|E
5|$|Just {{after midnight}} on 4 August the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades were {{attacked}} at Romani. At 08:00, the regiment, {{acting as the}} brigade vanguard, advanced towards Dueidar; {{at the same time}} they could hear firing in the distance from Romani. By 10:30 they were approaching the Turkish position on Mount Royston, and the regiment opened out to attack, with the 8th Squadron positioned on the left, the 1st in the centre, and the 10th on the right, with the Auckland Mounted Rifles following in support. The 5th Light Horse Regiment, who were supposed to be to the left of the 8th Squadron, had not yet arrived. The assault commenced at 15:00, supported by the Somerset Battery Royal Horse Artillery, and by 17:30 they had driven the Turks off Mount Royston. The brigade captured an artillery battery and over 1,000 prisoners. The regiment's casualties during the battle were one dead and fifteen wounded. The next day at 03:30 they moved to Katia, which was believed to be occupied by a large Turkish force. On arrival, the brigade galloped forward, attacking from the south. When they <b>got</b> <b>close</b> the regiment dismounted and continued on foot. Fighting all day, they waited in vain for the 3rd Light Horse Brigade to support the assault. Still holding their ground at 20:00, they had to retire and return to Bir et Maler to water their horses. Their casualties were two dead and fifteen wounded.|$|E

The Burman soldiers wisely retreated at the command of Pu Tong Seal, because of fear of losing their beloved king.|$|E

25|$|The corvi {{helped the}} Romans seize the first 30 Carthaginian ships that <b>got</b> <b>close</b> enough, {{including}} the Carthaginian flagship.

The corvi were usually still able to pivot and grapple most oncoming ships. Once an additional 20 of the Carthaginian ships had been hooked and lost to the Romans, Hannibal retreated with his surviving ships, leaving Duilius with a clear victory.|$|E
