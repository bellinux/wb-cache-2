40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the present situation}} of <b>job</b> <b>adaptation</b> and perceived social support of community nurses in Changchun, and to explore the relevance between them, {{for the purpose of}} providing the basis for community nursing managers to implement effective human resource management. Methods: A general demographic information questionnaire, <b>job</b> <b>adaptation</b> obstacle scale and perceived social support scale were used to investigate 290 community nurses in Changchun. Results: The score of <b>job</b> <b>adaptation</b> obstacle was 20. 85 ± 5. 18; the score of perceived social support was 64. 25 ± 10. 32, the score of support in the family was 20. 01 ± 3. 58, and the score of the support out of family was 42. 57 ± 6. 86; the <b>job</b> <b>adaptation</b> obstacle was negatively correlated with the perceived social support, the support in the family, and the support out of family. Conclusion: The <b>job</b> <b>adaptation</b> situation of the nurses in the survey communities was generally poor and the perceived social support was at a moderate level. Therefore, community nursing managers should actively understand the situation of nurse <b>job</b> <b>adaptation,</b> and then take effective measures to improve the community nurses social support, improve the current situation of the poor <b>job</b> <b>adaptation</b> of the community nurses, and prevent loss of nursing talents, for the improvement of the quality of nursing service...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{controversy in}} the literature on employee withdrawal/adaptation concerns whether job satisfaction predicts behaviors that are manifestations of this construct. Although the area has not lacked for empirical research, Hulin (1991) has argued that several unresolved issues have limited the generalizations we can make about the role of job satisfaction in influencing isolated work behaviors. Hulin (1991) hypothesized that there is a general construct underlying many adaptive behaviors, including job withdrawal. When this general construct is assessed through combination of individual behaviors, the ability of constructs such as job satisfaction to influence <b>job</b> <b>adaptation</b> was hypothesized to increase over the prediction of specific behaviors. In the present study, individual behaviors thought to represent the adaptation construct were obtained through three different sources of data. Job satisfaction, subjective well-being, and other variables were hypothesized to influence the adaptation construct within the framework of a causal model. Results indicated support for both the <b>job</b> <b>adaptation</b> construct and its relation to job satisfaction and subjective well-being...|$|E

As predicted, it was found that mental health, indexed in terms of affective well-being, had improved slightly since the previous interview. Adaptation of this kind was greater for men who had previously reported lower commitment to having a job and greater contact outside their immediate family, and also for those at the extremes of the age range. Measured availability of money and quality of social relationships were not related to adaptation. Changes in aspiration, autonomy and competence were considered likely to underpin the improvement in well-being. The need to study these additional components of mental health was emphasized, in order to determine when improvements in reported well-being should be considered 'healthy' or 'unhealthy'. unemployment mental health <b>jobs</b> <b>adaptation...</b>|$|R
40|$|Population ageing {{and rising}} costs of {{long-term}} care mean that organisations will be confronted in the future with {{a growing number of}} employees who combine paid work with providing informal care to a relative or non-kin. Combining work and informal care successfully partly depends on job and care-related features, but more information is needed on the importance of organisational aspects in this regard. The impact of organisational support on work outcomes (work-care balance and perceived need for <b>job</b> <b>adaptations)</b> was studied among 1, 991 employed informal caregivers in 50 different organisations. Multilevel logistic regression analyses revealed that a heavy care burden decreased the odds of combining work and care successfully. Caregivers who felt supported by colleagues and supervisors, and who worked in supportive organisations had higher odds of good work outcomes. The findings imply that organisations should be explicit about their concern for informal caregivers and be particularly aware of colleagues with heavy care responsibilities. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The present {{meta-analysis}} {{examined the}} tenure, age, and {{gender differences in}} the relationship between job insecurity and its job-related and health-related consequences. A total of 133 studies, providing 172 independent samples, were included in the analysis. Our results basically replicated Sverke et al. 2 ̆ 7 s (2002) meta-analytic findings with an updated methodological approach and a larger database. The main differences between our findings and Sverke et al. 2 ̆ 7 s are that the negative association between job insecurity and job performance was significant and that the relationship between insecurity and job involvement was smaller in our study. The moderator analysis also indicated that: (1) the positive association between job insecurity and turnover intention was stronger among employees with shorter tenure than those with longer tenure, and was stronger among younger than older employees; (2) the negative effect of insecurity on its health outcomes was more severe among employees with longer tenure than those with shorter tenure, and was more severe among older than younger employees; (3) the relationship between insecurity and the criterion variables was similar across gender.

40|$|World {{population}} {{aging is}} a phenomenon we are confronting with, more than past. This fact has different implications for today’s societies. One of these aspects is workforce (1). Some factors have resulted in more tendencies of workers to remain in their works including: Economic, societal, cultural factors, and social trends and laws such as increasing age of retirement in the middle twentieth century, which recently increased more (2).       Productive workforce is one of major assets of each country. So, in one hand we have older adults in our workplaces and in other hand, we are following to retain employee’s productivity at first, and then, improve it. Ergonomics as a multidisciplinary science, attempts to make balance between human capabilities and its limitations by fitting the task to the person or fitting the person to the task. In this way, workers’ fatigue and errors are minimized and productivity and well-being optimized (3).     In more developed countries like United States, approximately 66. 3 percent of adults aged 55 - 64 years are in the workforce (4). In our country, Iran, 7. 3 % of populations were more than 60 yrs. in 2006 (5) which indicate our population is aging, though accurate number of those people in work is lacking. Older adults have physical and mental changes as a common result of aging. Physical changes show itself as decline in physical capabilities, and mental changes involved in sensation and perception, cognition, and motor control (6). So, {{it is essential to}} acknowledge these changes and adopt suitable strategies and accommodations for job circumstances and living environments when considering older adults.     In general, a few ergonomics studies explored the effect of aging on environmental modifications and <b>job</b> <b>adaptation.</b> To best of my knowledge, also in Iran there are few studies that presented in conferences or published in journals. Therefore, as a closing remark, it is widely needed {{to pay more attention to}} aging ergonomics in our studies and society to ensure the safety and effectiveness of older workers. Finally, to initiate this movement, some kinds of funds or supports from universities, the government and research centers are recommended to shift research plans or students’ thesis to topics concerning aging ergonomics.  ...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} factors, {{individual and}} work related, influencing work ability, {{and to assess}} the association between work ability and employment status, activities of daily life (ADLs) {{and quality of life}} in patients with SSc. Methods: Fifty-seven consecutive patients (53 females/ 4 males) with SSc (47 lcSSc/ 10 dcSSc) were included. Median age was 58 [interquartile range (IQR) 47 - 62] years and disease duration 14 (9 - 19) years. The patients were assessed for socio-demographic characteristics, disease parameters, symptoms, work ability, empowerment and adaptations in a workplace, social support, ADLs and quality of life. Results: Work ability, assessed with the Work Ability Index (WAI) could be evaluated in 48 of 57 patients. The correlation between employment status and WAI was good (r(s) = 0. 79, P < 0. 001). Thirteen patients had good or excellent WAI, 15 had less good and 20 had poor WAI. There {{were no significant differences between}} subgroups of WAI and socio-demographic characteristics, disease duration or degree of skin and lung involvement. However, patients with good WAI expressed milder perceived symptoms (pain, fatigue and impaired hand function; P < 0. 001). Patients with better WAI had better competence (P < 0. 001), better possibility of adaptations at work (P < 0. 01) and impact at work (P < 0. 01) than those with poorer WAI. Conclusions: In SSc, pain, fatigue and impaired hand function have a dominant impact on the WAI. Employment interventions should include support in <b>job</b> <b>adaptations</b> as well as self-management strategies to help patients deal with pain and fatigue and to enhance the confidence to perform their work...|$|R
40|$|Study design: Survey. Objectives: To {{explore the}} process of {{reintegration}} in paid work following a traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), including the role of early expectations of individual patients regarding return to work, indicators of success of job reintegration and a description of reintegration interventions and barriers. Setting: Dutch rehabilitation centre with special department for patients with spinal cord injuries. Methods: Descriptive analysis of data gathered by a mailed questionnaire, which was returned by 57 persons (response 83 %) with traumatic SCI, aged 18 - 60 years, and data of earlier expectations reported by the individual patients during the rehabilitation admission following SCI from 1990 to 1998. Results: Of 49 respondents who were employed {{at the moment of}} the SCI, 45 % expected to be able to resume work. These positive expectations were associated with a higher educational level. In 67 %, return to work was successful. The chance to reintegrate successfully was better if the patient expected to resume work. Logistic regression analysis did not reveal other significant indicators. About one-third of the 49 respondents working preinjury followed vocational retraining, which was successful for most of them so far. In the majority of work situations modi. cations have been made, such as <b>job</b> <b>adaptations</b> and reduction of working hours. Several unmet needs regarding reintegration interventions were also reported. Conclusions: Positive expectations regarding resumption of work after a SCI are an important indicator of successful reintegration in work. An active role of the rehabilitation team is recommended in drawing up a vocational reintegration plan to prepare the patient, the employer and professionals involved in the reintegration process...|$|R

Most of this adaptation literature is concentrated on how life events affect measures of life satisfaction and happiness, whereas adaptation processes of domain satisfactions like job satisfaction are largely unstudied. The aim {{of this paper is}} to test empirically adaptation processes of self-reported job satisfaction. For this purpose we consider flexibility characteristics of a job and derive hypotheses about which flexibility measures allow for or impede adaptation processes. Hypotheses are tested using data from up to 18 waves of the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS). We estimate fixed-effects panel models to test adaptation processes based on intra-individual changes in job satisfaction.

40|$|In this {{comprehensive}} and well documented {{study on the}} minority education in America, Ogbu approaches the question of poor minority performance in school from a different but a powerful crosscultural perspective. His major hypothesis is that lower school performance {{on the part of}} blacks is an adaptation to their social and occupational positions in adult life, which do not require high educational qualifications (p. 213). The dominant white caste maintains the adaptation by providing blacks with inferior <b>jobs.</b> The <b>adaptation</b> is also maintained by certain structural and cultural features of the black environment which have evolved under the caste system. The job ceiling and other caste barriers influence the course of linguistic, cognitive, and motivational development of black children. He rejects categorically the explanation that attributes this academic retardation and asserts repeatedly that the parish caste-like status is powerful though subtle and hidden - determinant of behavior of black children. “What does affect black education is the fact that American society, through its political, economic, administrative, and other institutions, restricts blacks to menial social and occupational roles, low income, and poor residential status” (p. 214) ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. This study {{aimed to}} explore the {{perceived}} work ability of patients with postpoliomyelitis syndrome (PPS), to identify barriers and factors that are impeding or conducive, respectively, to work participation, and to identify possible interventions. Methods. Qualitative cross-sectional interview study with 17 subjects with PPS, 12 women and 5 men, mean age 49 years (SD: 11). Semi-structured interviews were held with the subjects in their homes, {{with the aid of}} a topic list. The COREQ criteria list for qualitative research was used as guideline in design and analysis. Results. Thirteen out of 17 subjects rated their work ability six or higher on a scale from 0 to 10. Most subjects worked in an administrative, educational or managerial function. Five subjects stopped working, four worked between 0 and 20 h/week and eight worked between 20 and 40 h/week. Factors conducive to working were physical adaptations in the workplace, accessibility of the workplace and high decision latitude. Barriers to full work ability in PPS patients were high physical job demands, low social support and the symptoms of PPS, especially fatigue and pain. Conclusions. These findings suggest that work-oriented interventions aimed at preventing PPS patients from dropping out of the workforce should primarily focus on reducing physical <b>job</b> demands, arranging <b>adaptations</b> in the workplace and increasing job contro...|$|R
40|$|A {{new era of}} High-Performance Computing {{has been}} coming about during the last decade. The overabundance of {{resources}} lying idle throughout the Internet, {{for long periods of}} time, calls for resource-sharing infrastructures operating in the settings of the Cluster, Grid, P 2 P and Cloud. Many organizations own grids, frequently underutilized, but impose several restrictions to their usage by outside users.

The WHO Code is a tool for global diplomacy, {{providing}} a policy framework to address the challenges involved in managing dentist migration, as well as improving the retention of dental personnel in source countries. The WHO Code recognizes the importance of migrant dentist data to support migration polices; minimum data on the inflows, outflows and stock of dentists are vital. Data on reasons for dentist migration, <b>job</b> satisfaction, cultural <b>adaptation</b> issues, geographic distribution and practice patterns in the destination country are important for any policy analysis on dentist migration. Key challenges in the implementation of the WHO Code include the necessity to coordinate with multiple stakeholders and the lack of integrated data on dentist migration and the lack of shared understanding of the interrelatedness of workforce migration, needs and planning.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} scheduler extensions {{that enable}} better adaptation of parallel {{programs to the}} execution conditions of non-dedicated computational farms with limited memory resources. The purpose of the techniques is to prevent thrashing and co-schedule communicating threads, using two disjoint, yet cooperating extensions to the kernel scheduler. A thrashing prevention module enables memory-bound programs to adapt to memory shortage, via suspending their threads at selected points of execution. Thread suspension is used so that memory is not over-committed by parallel jobs –which {{are assumed to be}} running as guests on the nodes of the computational farm – at memory allocation points. In the event of thrashing, parallel jobs are the first to release memory and help local resident <b>jobs</b> make progress. <b>Adaptation</b> is implemented using a shared-memory interface in the /proc filesystem and upcalls from the kernel to the user space. On an orthogonal axis, co-scheduling is implemented in the kernel with a heuristic that boosts periodically the priority of communicating threads. Using experiments on a cluster of workstations, we show that when a guest parallel job competes with general-purpose interactive, I/O-intensive, or CPU and memoryintensive load on the nodes of the cluster, thrashing prevention reduces drastically the slowdown of the job at memory utilization levels of 20 % or higher. The slowdown of parallel jobs is reduced by up to a factor of 7. Co-scheduling provides a limited performance improvement at memory utilization levels below 20 %, but has no significant effect at higher memory utilization levels...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to jointly test effects of work stressors and coping strategies on job performance among employees in the Greater China region. A self-administered survey was conducted to collect data from three major cities in the region, namely Beijing, Hong Kong, and Taipei (N = 380). Four important work stressors were assessed: heavy workload, organizational constraints, lack of work autonomy, and interpersonal conflict. We used a four-factor model of Chinese coping strategies composed of hobbies/relaxation, active action, seeking social support, and passive <b>adaptation.</b> <b>Job</b> performance was indicated by both task performance (quantity of work, quality of work, job knowledge) and contextual performance (attendance, getting along with others). We found that: (1) work stressors were related to job performance. Specifically, workload had a positive relation with quantity of work, whereas organizational constraints had negative relations with quantity of work and attendance. In addition, interpersonal conflict had a negative relation with getting along with others. (2) Chinese positive coping strategies were positively related to job performance. Specifically, seeking social support had positive relations with quantity of work and getting along with others, whereas active action had positive relations with attendance and job knowledge. (3) Chinese passive adaptation coping behaviors were negatively related to job performance. Specifically, passive adaptation had negative relations with quantity of work, quality of work, and getting along with others. The present study thus found joint effects of work stressors and coping behaviors among Chinese employees in the Greater China region, encompassing three sub-societies of mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.
