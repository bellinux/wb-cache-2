40|$|The role {{of grain}} size on the {{developed}} microstructure and mechanical properties of neutron irradiated nanocrystalline copper was investigated {{by comparing the}} radiation response of material to the conventional micrograined counterpart. Nanocrystalline (nc) and micrograined (MG) copper samples were subjected {{to a range of}} neutron exposure levels from 0. 0034 to 2 dpa. At all damage levels, the response of MG-copper was governed by radiation hardening manifested by an increase in strength with accompanying ductility loss. Conversely, the response of nc-copper to neutron irradiation exhibited a dependence on the damage level. At low damage levels, grain growth was the primary response, with radiation hardening and embrittlement becoming the dominant responses with increasing damage levels. Annealing experiments revealed that grain growth in nc-copper is composed of both thermally-activated and irradiation-induced components.

The model considers also nonlinear kinematic and isotropic hardening and is derived from a thermodynamic framework based on the multiplicative split of the deformation gradient. The kinematic <b>hardening</b> <b>component</b> represents a continuum extension of the classical rheological model of Armstrong-Frederick kinematic hardening.

Some material parameters reflecting the micromechanical behavior of DD 99, such as microhardness H, Young’s modulus E, yield stress σy, strain <b>hardening</b> <b>component</b> n, and tensile strength σb, {{can be obtained from}} load-displacement relations. H and E of four different crystal planes evidently decrease with the increase of h.

40|$|The {{deformation}} behaviour and dislocation substructure of crystalline solids {{is attributed}} to the physical processes of dislocation passing obstacles. The energy needed to overcome an obstacle, i. e. an impurity, atom, etc. is provided by activated dislocation caused by either mechanical or thermally activated processes. To verify which deformation mechanism is active in low alloy steel, tensile tests interrupted by stress relaxation periods were studied. These tests were performed over temperatures ranging from 288 K to 873 K and at constant strain rate. Strain rates before and after stopping the cross-head and deformation mechanisms were determined. The results of these experiments and how they correlate {{with the effects of}} temperature were also discussed. Rather than interpreting the difference to be due to mechanically activated deformation, as has been considered elsewhere, deformation was considered to be thermally activated with a component responsible for hardening and a component unaccompanied by hardening. Creep of low alloy ferrite steel is recovery controlled. Recovery in this material was caused by complex structures of carbides precipitates while dislocation tangles recovery was attributed both to carbide growth and to tangled dislocations re-arrangement and annihilation. Mechanical activation of dislocation glide has not been detected in these experiments. Flow stresses were calculated from the strain rate differences together with the strains estimated to be due to the <b>hardening</b> <b>component</b> of deformation using a rate equation that describe thermally activated glide controlled deformation. Flow stress–strain curves that were plotted were found to be independent of testing temperature.

40|$|The {{combination}} of the processes deep drawing and electromagnetic pulse forming is a promising way {{to cope with the}} ever higher complexity of new sheet metal designs. A cooperation between the Institute of Materials Science (IW) of the Leibniz Universität Hannover and the Institute of Applied Mechanics (IFAM) of the RWTH Aachen is investigating these processes both experimental and in simulation. Aim is the characterization of the combined process. Therefore the material properties of the investigated aluminum alloy EN AW 6082 T 6 have to be determined quasi-static as well as at high speed. These properties are then used as a basic for the simulations. Anisotropic behaviors as well as dynamic hardening effects are investigated in the quasi-static state. Several experiments for analyzing "Bauschinger" respectively "Ratcheting effects" have been conducted resulting in a new measuring set-up for thin sheets. For the determination of high speed forming limit diagrams a novel testing device {{on the basis of the}} Nakajima-test has been developed allowing for strain rates of approximately 10 ^ 3 s^- 1. Both testing methods are described in this paper; the results are then used to adapt the simulation models for the combined processes. The high speed deformation process is simulated by means of finite elements using a material model developed at the IFAM. The finite strain constitutive model combines nonlinear kinematic and isotropic hardening and is derived in a thermodynamic setting. It is based on the multiplicative split of the deformation gradient in the context of hyperelasticity. The kinematic <b>hardening</b> <b>component</b> represents a continuum extension of the classical rheological model of Armstrong-Frederick kinematic hardening which is widely adopted as capable of representing the above metal hardening effects.

40|$|International audienceA long-standing {{problem in}} the {{modelling}} of polycrystal behavior from {{the knowledge of the}} constitutive equations of single crystals is the incorporation of grain size effects. Standard ho-mogenization procedures efficiently take into account grain to grain interaction primarily induced by strain incompatibilities at grain boundary and grain morphology effects. Continuum crystal plasticity models are available that satisfactorily describe dislocation forest hardening associated with multiplication and dynamic recovery of dislocation populations. One strong limitation of these techniques is that the local crystal plasticity constitutive parameters at the grain scale are assumed to be known. Conversely, these material parameters can be identified from the macroscopic polycrystal response by an inverse approach involving the homogenization model. But then the found crystal plasticity model will be valid only for the considered grain size and the model can hardly be used for prediction of polycrystal behavior for another grain state of the material. Generalized continuum approaches arise as the suitable mechanical framework for formulating enhanced crystal plasticity models that intrinsically include grain size dependent local material responses. They incorporate the dislocation density tensor as a consitutive variable. Recent developments have shown the limitations of existing strain gradient models {{in the case of a}} two-phase laminate microstructure under single or double slip [1]. They plead for a theory even more general than the strain gradient or Cosserat approach, namely the micromorphic model presented here. The effect of the dislocation density tensor is introduced into the classical crystal plasticity framework by means of a micromor-phic theory of single crystals. A computational homogenization strategy is presented in order to simulate the global and local responses of two-dimensional polycrystalline aggregates for grain sizes ranging from 1 to 200 microns. The model is shown to induce a size-dependent kinematic <b>hardening</b> <b>component</b> which is responsible for the observed strong size effects. The yield stress at a given averaged plastic deformation is shown to follow a power law scaling relation for grain sizes larger than a critical grain size. The field of plastic deformation is also strongly affected by grain size, micron-size grains leading to the formation of intense slip bands crossing several grains...|$|E

A huge effort has been invested to improve reliability, using reliable radiation <b>hardened</b> <b>components.</b> However, failures cannot be eliminated totally.

40|$|The {{competitive}} {{aspect of}} surface and subsurface fatigue cracks propagation in <b>hardened</b> <b>components</b> subjected to rolling contact fatigue is highlighted, the former being greatly {{affected by the}} working conditions (in particular the presence of tangential stresses and lubricant), the latter depending mainly on the inclusions content and on the hardness profile. In order to determine which one {{of these kinds of}} damage is favoured, initial data consisting in contact load, rolling and sliding speed, rheological properties of the lubricant, material hardness and inclusions content are necessary. The concurrent role of asperities and Hertzian stress field in determining surface crack propagation is explained with the approach of the “quiescent zone”, calculating the stress intensity factors range in a contact cycle and considering the pumping effect of the fluid possibly present on the contact surface. Inherent defects (especially oxides) are thought to be responsible for subsurface cracks origin and the Murakami formula for short cracks is extrapolated to describe their growth threshold, which also depends on the hardness and therefore on the depth in surface <b>hardened</b> <b>components.</b> A crack propagation index is then defined as a ratio of applied to threshold stress intensity factor, both for surface and subsurface cracks.
