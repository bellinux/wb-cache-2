The parts were {{made available}} {{to comply with the}} regulations of sanctioning bodies for racing events in which Valiants had been entered by factory-backed teams: All parts used had to be [...] "stock" [...] parts, the definition of which meant that they were available through normal factory parts channels. The Hyper Pak consisted of a very-long-ram intake manifold meant to accept a Carter AFB 4-barrel carburetor, the AFB carburetor itself and an appropriate air cleaner, dual (front-3 and rear-3) cast-iron exhaust headers, a large-diameter exhaust Y-pipe to connect to these dual cast-iron headers, a larger muffler, a 276°-duration camshaft with appropriate valve springs and pushrods, a heavier-duty clutch, a manual choke control, a starter motor modification template and, in the full-race version of the package, high-compression pistons designed to increase the engine's compression ratio to 10.5 from the stock 8.5. The Hyper Pak was recommended for installation only on vehicles equipped with manual transmissions, for the camshaft was of such characteristics that a <b>high</b> <b>idle</b> speed was required to prevent engine stall-out. The Hyper Pak was primarily intended for competition driving, its road manners involving rough idling and poor cold-engine driveability, a high power band and poor fuel economy. But, in competition events, it proved unbeatable. Eight factory-backed Valiants entered the 1960 NASCAR compact car race at Daytona Beach, and humbled the competition; the Valiants came in first through eighth. After a similar performance the following year, the race was dropped. A high-fidelity reproduction of the Hyper Pak intake manifold was created by noted Slant-6 builder Doug Dutra in the late 1990s; subsequently the tooling was sold to a marketer of performance equipment for inline six-cylinder engines.|$|E

The proposed method inserts the catalyst in a bath of a strong organic solvent that dissolves oil, soot and fuel residues, cleaning the active surface of the catalyst. The tests were conducted at low (750 r/min) and high (3100 r/min) idle speeds. The experimental results based on CO, HC and catalyst inlet–outlet temperature difference measure-ments indicate that after treatment the catalytic efficiency improves considerably (25 per cent) at low idle (750 r/min). The improvement is even higher at <b>high</b> <b>idle</b> (3100 r/min), exceeding 40 per cent.

High volume products can be produced cost-efficiently in dedicated assembly lines, but the assembly of low-volume products in such lines involves <b>high</b> <b>idle</b> times and operation costs. Reconfigurable assembly lines offer reasonable solution for the problem; however, it is still complicated to identify the set of products which are worth to assemble in such a line instead of dedicated ones. In the paper a novel method is introduced that supports the long-term decision to relocate the assembly of a product with decreasing demand from a dedicated to a reconfigurable line, based on the calculated investment and operational costs. In order to handle the complex aspects of the planning problem a new approach is proposed that combines discrete-event simulation and machine learning techniques.

30|$|To {{compute the}} {{efficiency}} (the value 1 corresponds to no idle time), the MTM value t_MTM for the handling time {{was taken as}} the optimal handling time. The reduced value for t_MTM had to be applied, because a modified experimental design of the workplace simplified the processing procedure. While for the standard conveyer belt system the idle time steadily increases, it decreases steadily for the divided conveyer belt with fixed input and almost vanishes completely if input is variable. The very <b>high</b> <b>idle</b> time at input position 2 is significant for a “fixed” input position. The {{reason for this is}} based on the origin of the vacant space, which is relatively narrow at this point in time. This makes further general cargo input difficult. The approach to realizing a bigger speed step at this point must be rejected on account of the subsequent speed steps. Although this table shows some relict of idle time at position 2 —there is still a minimal amount of mutual impediment—the system performance does almost entirely depend on the handling time only.|$|E

In recent years, in many {{countries of the world}} production and use of biodiesel has gained popularity. In this research, biodiesel from palm and Calophyllum inophyllum oil has been produced using the trans-esterification process. Properties of the produced biodiesels were compared with the ASTM D 6751 standard: biodiesel standard and testing methods. Density, kinematic viscosity, flash point, cloud point, pour point and calorific value, these are the six main physicochemical properties that were investigated.

40|$|The power {{consumption}} of the Internet and datacenter networks is already significant due {{to a large degree}} of redundancy and <b>high</b> <b>idle</b> {{power consumption}} of network elements. Therefore, dynamically matching network resources to the load is highly desirable. However, this is difficult because the traffic changes quicker than it is possible to compute the minimal network subset to carry the traffic demand. We achieve responsiveness by decoupling the decisions taken by routing and online traffic engineering (TE), and propose Energy-Proportional Networks (EPN) – networks which use the minimum amount of energy to carry the required traffic. EPN computes three sets of routing tables: i) alwayson, ii) on-demand, and iii) failover. A simple energy-aware TE algorithm (in) activates network elements to achieve the goal of energy-proportionality. Our evaluation on ISP and datacenter topologies shows that EPN achieves the goal of energy-proportionality and saves up to 42 % of power, without sacrificing responsiveness. Further, using a Click testbed we show that it is possible to: 1) quickly and efficiently use the EPN paths at runtime for energy-saving, 2) quickly tolerate faults. Finally, two representative applications running over EPN-chosen paths demonstrate EPN’s marginal impact on application-level throughput and latency. 1...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{experiments}} {{have shown that}} it is impossible to achieve energy efficiency in single‐ server environments using current, non‐energy‐proportional hardware [1]. State‐of‐the‐art computer components use about 50 % of their peak energy just for being idle. Barroso et. al. have shown that servers typically operate under 10 – 50 % load [2], thus offering optimization potential in idle times. This topic recently gained a lot of attention and many papers have been published that try to improve the energy footprint of (database) servers. Nevertheless, no more than about 15 % improvement in energy efficiency was gained, often by sacrificing performance. Based on these findings, we conclude that a single, large database server as seen in today’s enterprises will never be energy proportional. Due to its <b>high</b> <b>idle</b> power consumption and the lack of scalable hardware, single‐server‐based databases will waste most of their energy during times of low load. The Vision To overcome the drawbacks mentioned, we envision a locally distributed database system that runs on a cluster of lightweight nodes.

Furthermore, smaller servers can be powered up and down independently...|$|E
40|$|ABOUT THE TEST REPORT AND USE OF THE DATA The {{test data}} {{contained}} {{in this report}} are a tabulation {{of the results of}} a series of tests. Due to the restricted format of these pages, only a limited amount of data and not all of the tractor specifications are included. The full OECD report contains usually about 30 pages of data and specifications. The test data were obtained for each tractor under similar conditions and therefore, provide a means of comparison of performance based on a limited set of reported data. EXPLANATION OF THE TEST PROCEDURES Purpose The purpose of the tests in this booklet, and available test reports is to provide users with data for comparisons of performance among tractor models. General Tractors are tested at the University of Nebraska according to test procedures of the OECD (Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development), the SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) International and the ASABE (American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers). The three codes are technically equivalent, but do differ slightly. For the past 10 years, the majority of tests have been performed according to the OECD codes. The manufacturer selects the tractor to be tested from its production line, provides the specifications, and certifies that the tractor is a stock model. Each tractor is equipped with the common energy consuming accessories (power steering, PTO, implement lifts, etc.). Any power consuming accessory may be disconnected when the means for doing so can be reached from the operator position. A manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s representative is present during the tests to as certain that the tractor gives its optimum performance. Weight can be added to the tractor to improve drawbar performance in certain tests. Static tire loads and inflation pressures must conform to the specifications of the Tire and Rim Association or to weight limits set by the manufacturer. Specifications All manufacturers provide the Laboratory with detailed specifications which are required for the tests. The Nebraska Tractor Test report provides only a limited amount of data due to space constraints. Preparation for Test The tractor is required to have been limbered up by the manufacturer for a sufficient number of hours; if this was not done, this limber- up is performed at the Tractor Test Lab. Adjustments are permitted during this period. After the start of the official test, no adjustments can be made. Any adjustments. repairs, alterations or replacements are mentioned in the final Nebraska Tractor Test report. At this time, instrumentation for measuring engine rpm, fan speed, temperatures and pressures is installed on the tractor. The tractor is also provided with connections to the Lab 2 ̆ 7 s fuel supply. PTO Performance The tractor PTO is connected to a dynamometer, which is a device for putting a load on the tractor and measuring the power generated by the tractor. During the preliminary runs, the manufacturer is allowed to make some adjustments to optimize the performance. These adjustments, which include the injection pump volume and timing and the <b>high</b> <b>idle</b> set within the specified range, will remain during the whole test program and must be settings guaranteed by the manufacturer. The tests are performed while maintaining an ambient temperature of 75 °F (24 °C) and at a barometer reading above 28. 5 inches Hg (96. 6 kPa). Data are taken at intervals after the tractor performance has stabilized. Inlet fuel temperatures are also maintained at a predetermined level. The throttle being set for maximum no-load rpm (<b>High</b> <b>Idle),</b> an increasing load is applied to the PTO by the dynamometer along the operating curve of the engine. The full test report will show the torque, rpm, power and fuel consumption data obtained at Rated Engine speed, Standard PTO speed (either 1000 or 540 rpm), the maximum power on the curve and the torque rise.

30|$|Virtually all {{households}} in the USA, as well as Europe, have electric meters installed [8]. While there are still conventional analog electric meters in use, electricity suppliers have started to equip households with modern digital “smart meters.” These “smart meters” replace traditional analog meters and offer the possibility of real-time usage data analysis by directly reporting the data to a utility from the provider. Unfortunately, these smart meters only provide usage data of a household’s overall power consumption and are dedicated {{to be used by}} metering service providers, not end users. This is disadvantageous because the provided data makes it difficult to identify per appliance power consumption or generate real-time feedback of energy usage for the end user. To achieve this traceability of energy usage, one field of research is to analyze high-fidelity power traces, measured by smart meters, and thus identify connected appliances and their current operating state [9 – 11] by their load signatures. Other research groups have worked in the field of wireless power metering. The basic concept is to provide a metering device {{in the form of a}} socket adapter or multi-contact plug, which connects to a wireless network to transfer the metering data to a data storage. “Plug” from MIT [12] thereby built a multi-contact plug with a current transformer and used analog-digital converters (ADC) for direct power metering of the connected load. Berkeley University’s ACme [8] is designed as a power plug adapter and with this equal to our solution. Like other similar devices, ACme has a high per adapter idle power consumption of 1 W, which is acceptable for measuring devices with high energy consumption like washing machines and PC work stations. For low-power-consuming devices, the <b>high</b> <b>idle</b> power of the metering adapters would waste lots of energy and thus reduce the potentially possible savings. We also have found several companies with smart home energy metering devices on the market [13 – 15]. Edimax “Smart Plug” uses Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11 standard network protocol for data communication, which is designed mainly as a versatile, high data rate radio protocol but not specialized for energy efficiency [14]. This explains the high power consumption of the metering devices and makes it less suitable for metering low-energy consumers. AVM “FRITZ!DECT 200 ” uses DECT ULE for data transmission [15]. Even if DECT ULE counts as low-energy radio standard, this device also requires an AVM FRITZ!Box IP router as base station. This limits the setup places and causes range issues (e.g., in basements). Voltcraft “Energy Count 3000 ” [13] uses 868 -MHz radio for communicating and is more energy efficient than any other evaluated platform. As disadvantage, it provides no support for an IP gateway and thus can only be accessed via handheld remote panel with low range. Energy Count 3000 lacks usability of a web or mobile interface, which makes this platform more applicable for technical enthusiasts. All in all, we think that the analyzed related works lack energy efficiency and usability. We tried to conquer this by developing a specialized radio protocol and hardware to significantly reduce energy consumption of measuring devices and provide a versatile back-end to generate helpful front-end applications that help improve the energy efficiency of regular households.|$|E

Oxides of nitrogen emissions were successfully correlated by a parametric group of combustor operating variables...|$|R
40|$|Several {{enhancements}} to ERICA are described. The resulting scheme, ERICA+ provides {{congestion avoidance}} with 100 % utilization. Even at 100 % utilization, the queue lengths are bounded. The scheme gives better control of end-to-end delay {{compared to other}} schemes and keeps link utilization of expensive links <b>high</b> despite <b>idle</b> periods in the input load. The scheme responds well to VBR traffic by estimating the ABR capacity and employing a scheduling strategy between ABR and VBR. Simulation results {{on a set of}} representative configurations will be presented. Source...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the wastes in a SME company which is PJ Foods Industries Sdn. Bhd. The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to apply the lean manufacturing concept, principles and tools to eliminate and reduce the occurred wastes in PJ Foods Industries Sdn. Bhd. Movement waste, waiting waste and motion waste were subject that being studied in this thesis. Several visits have been done and the data were collected through interview, observation, pictures and calculating the current total production time of 7 kg fried chicken flour product. Materials flow in the original layout, process maps and simulation on the original layout using Witness Software were used to determine the section or process that has <b>highest</b> <b>idle</b> percentage or wastes. Witness Software was also used to simulate the improvement layout and it was found that the improvements on layout managed to eliminate the movement waste and reducing other existing waste as well as reduce the total production time by 2. 31 % for every 20 packets. For the inventories of finished products, 5 S is the best method to improve and establish better workplace and housekeeping conditions. It is recommended that the suggestions in this thesis be applied in actual condition at PJ Foods Industries Sdn. Bhd in the next stage of the study...|$|R
40|$|Schneider National, Inc., SNI, has {{concluded}} the Cab Heating and Cooling evaluation of onboard, engine off idling solutions. During the evaluation period three technologies were tested, a Webasto Airtronic diesel fired heater for cold weather operation, and two {{different approaches to}} cab cooling in warm weather, a Webasto Parking Cooler, phase change storage system and a Bergstrom Nite System, a 12 volt electrical air conditioning approach to cooling. Diesel fired cab heaters were concluded to provide adequate heat in winter environments down to 10 F. With a targeted idle reduction of 17 %, the payback period is under 2 years. The Webasto Parking Cooler demonstrated the viability {{of this type of}} technology, but required significant driver involvement to achieve maximum performance. Drivers rated the technology as ''acceptable'', however, in individual discussions it became apparent they were not satisfied with the system limitations in hot weather, (over 85 F). The Bergstrom Nite system was recognized as an improvement by drivers and required less direct driver input to operate. While slightly improved over the Parking Cooler, the hot temperature limitations were only slightly better. Neither the Parking Cooler or the Nite System showed any payback potential at the targeted 17 % idle reduction. Fleets who are starting at a <b>higher</b> <b>idle</b> baseline may have a more favorable payback...|$|R
40|$|We analyze {{a setting}} typical of {{industries}} right after liberalization, or after structural demand and technology changes. An incumbent firm has an exogenous capacity, {{and a new}} entrant has to set its capacity level. We find that, in a dynamic context, higher capacity increases the severity of punishment after deviation, thereby favoring the emergence of cartels. The cartel in this case could hurt welfare, {{not only because of}} the standard deadweight loss motive, but also because of the cost inefficiency due to <b>high</b> and <b>idle</b> capacity. We conjecture that a competitive arrangement could be both welfare enhancing and profit-maximizing for the incumbent...|$|R
40|$|The nonrecoverable stall {{condition}} in high performance turbofan engines {{is characterized by}} thrust loss, rising turbine temperatures, high pressure compressor rotating stall, and loss of engine control. Stall recovery control is presently investigated {{by means of an}} engine system computer model capable of either surge or rotating stall postinstability operation. Several techniques are examined which can yield rapid recovery from stall; a composite strategy which involves reduction of engine speed to idle while simultaneously opening the 10 th- and 14 th-stage compressor bleed ports allowed recovery to speeds slightly <b>higher</b> than <b>idle</b> while combustor fuel flow continued...|$|R
40|$|As {{the number}} of {{application}} in wireless sensor networks are increasing because of ongoing miniaturization of electro-mechanical parts, its subsidiary elements and drastic decrease in the cost. The communication among sensor nodes consumes more energy than the actual computation of information. The consumption not only takes place in transmission state, but also relatively <b>high</b> in <b>idle</b> state. The focus {{of this paper is}} to identify the main source of energy dissipation, as well as counter measure to ensure prolonged network lifetime. In addition to these, different types of protocols for routing, medium access control and transport protocols are presented and clarified by the means of examples...|$|R
40|$|Gaseous {{emissions}} from a J 85 -GE- 13 turbojet engine were measured over {{a range of}} fuel-air ratios from idle to full afterburning and simulated altitudes from near sea-level to 12, 800 meters (42, 000 ft). Without afterburning, carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon emissions were <b>highest</b> at <b>idle</b> and lowest at takeoff; oxides of nitrogen exhibited the reverse trend. With afterburning, carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon emissions were greater than for military power. Carbon monoxide emissions were altitude dependent. Oxides of nitrogen emissions were less at minimum afterburning than at military power. For power levels above minimum afterburning, the oxides of nitrogen emissions were both power level and altitude dependent...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} conform to {{stringent}} emissions legislation, three-way catalysts have been routinely fitted to gasoline-powered vehicles {{in order to reduce}} the emissions of carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides. In Europe the majority of all personal car journeys are less than 4 km in length, with the emissions produced in the first kilometre accounting for 80 % of the total emissions produced in that journey. This is due to the time taken for the catalyst to attain 'light-off' signified by the point at which a catalyst reaches a sufficiently high temperature to allow chemical reactions to occur. There are a number of methods used to reduce the light-off time such as retarded spark timing, <b>higher</b> <b>idle</b> speeds, artificial loading of the engine, secondary air injection and λ control. While numerous studies have investigated light-off strategies in isolation, or in limited combinations, this study is the first in the open literature to examine all the above factors simultaneously and to assess how their impacts on the exhaust gas temperatures varies with the distance away from the exhaust ports. Experimental work was undertaken in order to generate empirical models to predict the effects of the catalyst heating strategies of gasoline engines on the light-off times of the production three-way catalyst and the exhaust gas temperatures at various distances along the exhaust system up to, and including, the inlet to the catalyst. The empirical model demonstrated good accuracy with errors in the temperature predictions, when compared with experimental data, found to be, on average, less than - 0. 6 % at the pre-catalyst location...|$|R
