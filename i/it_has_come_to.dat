5|$|A catchy jingle and ad campaign, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> embody a {{piece of}} Americana, and has even seeped into the {{consciousness}} {{of people who were}} too young (or not even alive) to remember the campaign when it occurred. The slogan was so well-remembered that it was added to Simpson's Contemporary Quotations in 1988.|$|E
5|$|Although the BBC has {{invested}} in the reconstruction of episodes using animation, it has never attempted to do anything {{in the way of}} complete re-staging of missing episodes; the closest that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> this was the recreation of parts of various serials, including the completely missing Marco Polo, in the docudrama An Adventure in Space and Time produced for the 50th anniversary in 2013. However, in 2012 a reimagined version of The Power of the Daleks, written by, directed by, and starring Nick Scovell, was released on YouTube in three parts before it was shown complete at the Power:Reimagined convention in September 2012.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{began the}} task of {{restoring}} federal coins to circulation in 1864 with a two-cent piece in bronze, and by authorizing a three-cent piece in copper-nickel the following year. In 1866, it authorized a five-cent piece in the latter alloy, the nickel, as <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> be known. With the three-cent silver effectively replaced by base-metal pieces, it did not share in the increased mintage of silver coins that began in 1868. The three-cent silver was struck {{at the rate of}} a few thousand per year into the 1870s.|$|E

5|$|The stylised lily, or fleur-de-lis (lily flower) {{has long}} been {{associated}} with royalty, although it may originally have been derived from {{the form of an}} iris. It has also been associated with the head of a spear. Its three parts have been associated with the three classes of mediaeval society, or alternatively faith, wisdom and chivalry. Whatever its exact derivation, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> be associated with France and the French monarchy since the earliest Frankish kings. Consequently, it became incorporated into not only French heraldry but also that of many heraldic devices in jurisdictions where there had been historic French influence, such as Quebec and New Orleans. In modern times it appears in many forms, symbolic and decorative, and can be used on compasses to indicate the direction north, as well as the Scouting movement.|$|E

25|$|The {{interest}} in an index that measures body fat came with increasing obesity in prosperous Western societies. BMI was explicitly cited by Keys as appropriate for population studies and inappropriate for individual evaluation. Nevertheless, {{due to its}} simplicity, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> be widely used for preliminary diagnosis. Additional metrics, such as waist circumference, can be more useful.|$|E
25|$|Spiders in {{this family}} are {{commonly}} known as sheet weavers (from the shape of their webs), or money spiders (in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and in Portugal, from the superstition that if such a spider is seen running on you, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> spin you new clothes, meaning financial good fortune).|$|E

25|$|The {{analysis}} of errors computed using the Global Positioning System {{is important for}} understanding how GPS works, and for knowing what magnitude of errors should be expected.
