40|$|The {{current study}} {{analyses}} {{the efficiency of}} choice set generation methods for bicycle routes and proposes the <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> functions to bicycle-oriented factors not limited to distance and time. Three choice set generation methods for route choice were examined {{in their ability to}} generate relevant and heterogeneous routes: doubly stochastic generation function, breadth first search on link elimination, and branch & bound algorithm. Efficiency of the methods was evaluated for a high-resolution network by comparing the performances with four multi-attribute cost functions accounting for scenic routes, dedicated cycle lanes, and road type. Data consisted of 778 bicycle trips traced by GPS and carried out by 139 persons living in the Greater Copenhagen Area, in Denmark. Results suggest that both the breadth first search on link elimination and the doubly stochastic generation function generated realistic routes, while the former outperformed in computation cost and the latter produced more heterogeneous routes...|$|E

40|$|The capital {{expenditure}} appraisal process {{has so far}} been presented in the framework <b>of</b> a <b>cost</b> benefit analysis where all benefits and costs are expressed in monetary values. However, many projects or programs undertaken by governments produce benefits that may be considered to be highly desirable but whose quantification in monetary terms is difficult if not impossible. Common examples of such projects are the provision of elementary school education, improvements in the provision of health care services, investment in public security and the administration of justice. In such cases, a full cost benefit analysis may not be feasible for each individual project or program but a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) can be carried out. Such an analysis measures the quantities of benefits generated {{in terms of the number}} of units of the items produced, but no attempt is made to convert these into monetary values.

40|$|Abstract—This work {{describes}} {{a study of}} applying reinforcement learning to balance energy expenditure in wireless sensor networks, contributing both with a protocol and a novel observation regarding exploration in reinforcement learning. Our starting point is FROMS, our own multi-source multi-sink routing protocol which exploits learning to identify the lowest cost paths for data delivery. The primary modification here is an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cost</b> function to consider node battery levels in addition to our previous use of path length. The result is a dynamic cost function that greatly affects {{the behavior of the}} underlying reinforcement learning approach. This paper provides two main contributions. First, it {{describes a}}n extension to FROMS that effectively balances the energy expenditure across all network nodes. Second, and most importantly, it offers a study of the effects <b>of</b> a dynamic <b>cost</b> function in a reinforcement learning setting. Specifically, we show that explicit route exploration becomes unnecessary, and instead the dynamic nature <b>of</b> the <b>cost</b> function forces a new form of implicit exploration which sufficiently and efficiently learns the best data paths for balancing energy.
