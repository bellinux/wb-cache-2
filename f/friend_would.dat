5|$|One of {{the major}} {{international}} events surrounding Henry during the 1160s was the Becket controversy. When the Archbishop of Canterbury, Theobald of Bec, died in 1161 Henry saw an opportunity to reassert his rights over the church in England. Henry appointed Thomas Becket, his English Chancellor, as archbishop in 1162, probably believing that Becket, {{in addition to being}} an old <b>friend,</b> <b>would</b> be politically weakened within the Church because of his former role as Chancellor, and would therefore have to rely on Henry's support. Both Matilda and Eleanor appear to have had doubts about the appointment, but Henry continued regardless. His plan did not have the desired result, however, as Becket promptly changed his lifestyle, abandoned his links to the King and portrayed himself as a staunch protector of church rights.|$|E

25|$|Embezzlement is the {{unlawful}} taking of property {{by someone who}} it was entrusted to. For example, if a named person trusts their friend enough {{to allow them to}} hold their wallet, and the friend goes home without returning the wallet with the intention of keeping the money, the <b>friend</b> <b>would</b> have committed embezzlement.|$|E

25|$|Both por and pro often {{translate}} English 'for'. However, they distinguish for a goal (looking {{forward in}} time, or causing: por) {{and for a}} cause (looking back in time, or being caused by: pro): To vote por your friend means to cast a ballot with their name on it, whereas to vote pro your <b>friend</b> <b>would</b> mean to vote in their place or as they asked you to.|$|E
25|$|In {{his book}} Loyalists, British {{journalist}} Peter Taylor devotes pages 187–195 to the loyalists' South African arms deals which {{had taken place}} in the late 1980s. Jackson's name does not appear in the account nor is Australia referred to. Joe Gorrod is the only journalist to make these allegations although Henry McDonald (of The Guardian) affirmed that Jackson lived {{for a period of time}} in South Africa during the 1980s. The purported files, which were kept with a <b>friend,</b> <b>would</b> have ensured Jackson that he would never be sentenced to a lengthy imprisonment.|$|E
25|$|The 1909 {{death of}} Carlos VII turned {{political}} fortunes of de Cerralbo, who consulted {{by the new}} claimant Don Jaime advised that as a Carlist king he should adopt the name of Jaime III. Many distinguished Carlists pressed the pretender to dismiss Feliú and re-appoint Cerralbo. The claimant bowed to the pressure in 1912, creating a collective governing body, Junta Superior Central Tradicionalista, with de Cerralbo as its president. A number of authors claim that de Cerralbo was the de facto Jefe Delegado and the press, like many contemporaries, presented him as such. The competitive theory maintains that de Mella, sensing the forthcoming clash with Don Jaime, assumed that aging and sick Cerralbo, his old-time <b>friend,</b> <b>would</b> be easier to manipulate; some claim that following the appointment it was actually de Mella who was running the party.|$|E

25|$|In India, Ganesh Savarkar had {{organised}} {{an armed}} {{revolt against the}} Morley-Minto reforms of 1909. The British police implicated Savarkar in the investigation for allegedly plotting the crime. Hoping to evade arrest, Savarkar moved to Madame Cama's home in Paris. He was nevertheless arrested by police on 13 March 1910. In {{the final days of}} freedom, Savarkar wrote letters to a close friend planning his escape. Knowing that he would most likely be shipped to India, Savarkar asked his friend to keep track of which ship and route he would be taken through. When the ship SS Morea reached the port of Marseille on 8 July 1910, Savarkar escaped from his cell through a porthole and dived into the water, swimming to the shore in the hope that his <b>friend</b> <b>would</b> be there to receive him in a car. But his friend was late in arriving, and the alarm having been raised, Savarkar was re-arrested.|$|E
25|$|Hastings's {{appearances}} in Poirot's later novels {{are restricted to}} a few cases in which he participates on his periodic returns to England from Argentina. Poirot comments in The ABC Murders that he enjoys Hastings's visits because he always has his most interesting cases when Hastings is with him. In the course of The Big Four, Dulcie's life is threatened by members of an international conspiracy. Hastings is forced to risk Poirot's life in return for her promised safety. In other respects {{there is very little}} personal detail regarding Hastings in these novels, until , which takes place after World War II: With his wife now dead, Hastings rejoins Poirot at Styles to help tackle one last case. The novel culminates with Poirot dying of a heart attack, leaving Hastings a confession explaining his role in events as he tracked a criminal who manipulated others to commit murder for him. Poirot's friendship with Hastings is further referenced when the murderer's attempt to manipulate Hastings in such a manner leaves Poirot resolved to kill his adversary, despite his disapproval of murder, as he knew that his <b>friend</b> <b>would</b> normally never do such a thing.|$|E

At one of Joe's warehouses, White and Orange rendezvous with Pink, who believes that the job was a setup and {{that the police were}} waiting for them. White informs him that Brown is dead, Blue and Blonde are missing, and Blonde murdered several civilians during the heist; White is furious that Joe, his old <b>friend,</b> <b>would</b> employ such a [...] "psychopath". Pink has hidden the diamonds nearby; he argues with White over whether or not they should get medical attention for Orange. Blonde arrives with a kidnapped policeman, Marvin Nash.|$|E

500|$|Selena gave Saldívar her American Express {{card for}} the purpose of {{conducting}} company business. Saldívar, however, instead used it to rent Lincoln Town Cars, entertain associates in upmarket restaurants, and buy two cellular telephones which she carried. Staff at Selena Etc. complained that Saldívar was always [...] "nice" [...] when Selena was around; when she was not Saldívar treated everyone terribly. In December 1994, the boutiques began to suffer. The company's bank accounts lacked sufficient funds to pay bills. Staff levels at both stores had been reduced from thirty-eight to fourteen employees, mainly because Saldívar fired those she did not like. The remaining employees began complaining to Selena about Saldívar, but Selena did not believe her <b>friend</b> <b>would</b> hurt her or her business. The employees then began to take their concerns to Quintanilla, Jr. who warned Selena that Saldívar might be a dangerous person. Selena did not believe Saldívar would turn on her; her father had a habit of distrusting people.|$|E
500|$|After the {{completion}} of composing [...] "Fifteen", Swift became very nervous to show Anderson the song, for {{she did not know}} how her <b>friend</b> <b>would</b> respond. [...] "It was a really personal song, especially from her angle of it." [...] However, when Swift performed the song for Anderson and asked whether she was comfortable with the song, Anderson confirmed: [...] "She said, 'Does it bother you that your name is in a song that's so personal?' And it really doesn't just because of the way Taylor and I feel about it. If one girl can kind of learn from it or connect to a song like that, it's totally worth it." [...] With Anderson's consent, Swift recorded [...] "Fifteen" [...] with producer Nathan Chapman, who produced all but one track on Swift's 2006 eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift. Recording the highly personal track caused Swift to cry. Swift attributed the event to {{the fact that she is}} most likely to cry over when her loved ones undergo pain, as she witnesses it, rather than her own experiences. She went to say [...] "Fifteen" [...] usually gets her every time.|$|E

2500|$|Spelling Reform 1 or Spelling Reform step 1 (more {{commonly}} known as SR1) is an English spelling reform proposal advocated by British/Australian linguist Harry Lindgren.

SR1 {{was part of a}} 50-stage reform that Lindgren advocated in his book Spelling Reform: A New Approach (1969).|$|E
2500|$|Until the 1940s most births in {{the region}} {{occurred}} at home. [...] The {{birth of a child}} was considered an opportunity for family to gather and socialize. [...] Some considered it akin to quilting or corn shucking. [...] Women attended to the birthing woman while men socialized in a different room in the house or out on the porch. [...] Family and <b>friend</b> <b>would</b> come and go throughout the labor, especially if labor was long.|$|E
2500|$|Miss Marple had {{correctly}} {{concluded that}} her <b>friend</b> <b>would</b> recognise the real murderer if {{she saw him}} again in a similar pose.

A devout Catholic, she refused to divorce him, so he murdered her {{to be free to}} marry Emma and inherit the Crackenthorpe family fortune, once he had eliminated Emma's brothers.|$|E

2500|$|Goldman depicts Paul McCartney in an {{extremely}} positive light, as being the only true talent among the Beatles, {{and the man who}} made the band able to function. [...] On January 16, 1980, customs officials in Japan found 7.7 ounces (218.3 g) of cannabis in McCartney's luggage as he and the other musicians in Wings tried to enter the country for a concert tour. Rather than lay the blame for this incident on McCartney, Albert Goldman asserts that it was orchestrated by Yoko Ono. She supposedly had advance notice that her husband's <b>friend</b> <b>would</b> be smuggling drugs into her homeland. [...] She allegedly made overseas telephone calls to government officials she knew with the hope that he would be arrested, thereby giving her a good excuse to forbid her husband from communicating with his friend.|$|E
2500|$|Yusuf has {{reflected}} that {{his decision to}} leave the Western pop music business was perhaps too quick with too little communication for his fans. For most, it was a surprise, and even his long-time guitarist, Alun Davies, said in later interviews that he hadn't believed that his <b>friend</b> <b>would</b> actually go through with it, after his many forays into other religions throughout their relationship. Yusuf himself has said the [...] "cut" [...] between his former life and {{his life as a}} Muslim might have been too quick, too severe, and that more people might have been better informed about Islam, and given an opportunity to better understand it, and himself, if he had simply removed those items that were considered harām, in his performances, allowing him to express himself musically and educate listeners through his music without violating any religious constraints.|$|E
2500|$|Brodsky’s third book, The Inside Story, {{began as}} an off-hand comment from a friend. Brodsky asked if her <b>friend</b> <b>would</b> like Brodsky to mail some letters for her, and the friend responded, [...] "they'll be very happy." [...] This led Brodsky to imagine happy letters, excited to go where they are going. Rebecca Rule writes in her review {{that it is a}} story [...] "about what happens on those {{occasions}} (rare these days, it seems) when one writes and mails a personal letter, told {{from the point of view}} of an envelope." [...] This gave Brodsky an opportunity to broach the idea of change and how children can best understand and cope with it. Brodsky explains: [...] "Even though the story is an adventure about recycling and the mail system, I think the main theme is about change. Change is difficult for all of us. Kids often deal with change -- in school, in their families, in their neighborhoods." [...] For its discussion of recycling, the book received a national citation from the Green Book Festival in San Francisco.|$|E
