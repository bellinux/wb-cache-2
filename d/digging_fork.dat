50|$|Hardpan can be {{a problem}} in farming and {{gardening}} by impeding drainage of water and restricting the growth of plant roots. In these situations, the hardpan can be broken up by either mechanical means such as digging or plowing, or through the use of soil amendments. The broadfork is a manual tool specifically designed for this task; a <b>digging</b> <b>fork</b> or a spade might also be used. The chisel plow does a similar job {{with the help of a}} tractor.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} spade is a garden spade, which {{typically}} {{has a long}} handle, is wide, and is treaded (has rests for the feet to drive the spade into the ground). An Irish spade {{is similar to a}} common garden spade, with the same general design, although it has a much thinner head. A sharpshooter is a narrow spade. A turfing iron has a short, round head, and is used for cutting and paring off turf. A <b>digging</b> <b>fork,</b> or grape, is forked much like a pitchfork, and is useful for loosening ground and gardening. There can also be toy spades for children.|$|E
5000|$|A garden fork, spading fork, <b>digging</b> <b>fork</b> or graip is a {{gardening}} implement, with {{a handle}} and several (usually four) short, sturdy tines. It {{is used for}} loosening, lifting and turning over soil in gardening and farming. It is used similarly to a spade, but in many circumstances it is more appropriate than a spade: the tines allow the implement to be pushed more easily into the ground, it can rake out stones and weeds and break up clods, {{it is not so}} easily stopped by stones, and it does not cut through weed roots or root-crops. Garden forks were originally made of wood, but the majority are now made of carbon steel or stainless steel.|$|E
5000|$|John Arlott {{wrote of}} him:It was, perhaps, unfortunate for Dudley Carew that his entry into cricket writing should have {{coincided with the}} rise of Neville Cardus. If there had never been a Cardus, how highly should we have ranked one who wrote: [...] "At the other end Gunn batted much as a man potters about a garden, <b>digging</b> his <b>fork</b> into a bed with an {{abstracted}} and absent-minded air..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My friends," [...] {{said the}} laird, <b>digging</b> the carving <b>fork</b> into a cold turkey, [...] "we {{are also a}} hungry lot, if I may judge of others by myself, so let me advise you to fall to. We can't afford to sit long over our supper in present circumstances. Help yourselves, and {{make the most of}} your opportunities." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can eat {{much better}} without," [...] said Lavo; but to please Lucy his sister did try; {{slashing}} hard {{away with her}} knife, and <b>digging</b> her <b>fork</b> straight into a bit of meat. Then she very nearly ran it into her eye, and Lucy, who knew it was not good manners to laugh, was very near choking herself. And at last saying the knife and fork were [...] "Great good--great good; but none for eating," [...] they stuck them through the great tortoise shell rings they had in their ears and noses. Lucy was distressed about Uncle Joseph's knives and forks, which she knew she ought not to give away; but while she was looking about for Mrs. Bunker to interfere, Don seemed to think it his business and began to growl and fly at the little black legs.|$|R
50|$|The {{coming of}} the local {{railways}} made possible {{the expansion of the}} approximately 200-year-old agricultural implement manufacturing business in Banbury. The Britannia Works company's site was set up by Sir Bernard Samuelson from the earlier foundry established by James Gardner. Sir Samuelson had obtained a licence to make McCormick reapers by 1851, and by 1859 the firm was producing numerous agricultural machines, including turnip cutters, a patent <b>digging</b> and <b>forking</b> machine, a patent reaping machine, and lawn mowers. It {{is interesting to note that}} the firm also built the now demolished railway viaduct at Hook Norton. By 1881 the production of the company's produce was carried out at two separate works in south-east Banbury, which were linked by a tramway with a depot beside the railway, south of the Great Western Railway's station. Britannia Works was one of the town's major employers until the 1920s.|$|R
5000|$|In 1967, Anderson {{released}} [...] "A Knife and a Fork" [...] for Checker, {{recorded at}} FAME Studios in Alabama. [...] "A Knife and a Fork" [...] was a midtempo warning {{to his girlfriend}} about her consumption of food: [...] "girl, you gonna let a knife and a <b>fork</b> <b>dig</b> your grave". The single entered the Billboard R&B chart. A follow-up release, [...] "You'll Lose a Good Thing", issued by Excello Records, also made the Top 40 on the R&B chart. [...] "I Went Off and Cried" [...] (1968) may be his best-remembered recording, next to [...] "A Knife and a Fork". A cover version of [...] "A Knife and a Fork" [...] was recorded by Rockpile for the 1980 album Seconds of Pleasure.|$|R
