40|$|We apply control rights {{theory to}} explain the {{structure}} and determinants of financial covenants in private equity backed leveraged buyouts. We analyze 130 German transactions from 2000 to 2008, covering about 40 percent of the LBO market during this period. We consider Germany to be a superior institutional context as creditors have substantial rights in case of borrower default and contracts are negotiated more rigorously. Regarding structure {{we find that the}} <b>financial</b> <b>covenant</b> structure, in terms of number and types, is standardized and appears to be much more conservative than in the United States. Additionally, our results suggest that financial covenants are designed in a hierarchical manner, with the Debt to EBITDA covenant being the first to breach in early years. Regarding determinants we are the first, to our knowledge, to apply a direct measure of <b>financial</b> <b>covenant</b> restrictiveness, which is the real negotiated item between lead arrangers and sponsors. Our results show that <b>financial</b> <b>covenant</b> restrictiveness is significantly negatively related {{to the size of the}} private equity group, which serves as a proxy for reputation. Further we show that target-related factors, like growth and profitability, have a strong impact on <b>financial</b> <b>covenant</b> restrictiveness. With regard to transaction-based factors, increasing financial risk leads to more restrictive financial covenants.

By covenant cushion, we identify whether LBO borrowers are capable or incapable {{to comply with}} <b>financial</b> <b>covenant.</b> We show that incumbents can increase net debt issuance, have higher book leverage, decrease their cash holdings, and have greater firm size when LBO borrowers are in violation of <b>financial</b> <b>covenant.</b> Further, negative {{spillover effect}} on cost of issuing debt is channeled through the creditors. Overall, we provide consistent empirical evidence that negative spillover effect from LBO borrowers ’ actual covenant cushion is mainly on industry incumbents ’ financing policies...|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} a large number of {{financing}} decisions of solvent firms are dictated by creditors, who use the transfer of control rights accompanying <b>financial</b> <b>covenant</b> violations to address incentive conflicts between managers and investors. After showing that <b>financial</b> <b>covenant</b> violations occur among almost one third of all publicly listed firms, we find that creditors use the threat of accelerating the loan to reduce net debt issuing activity by over 2 % of assets per annum immediately following a covenant violation. Further, this decline is persistent in that net debt issuing activity fails to return to pre-violation levels even after two years, resulting in a gradual decline in leverage of almost 3 %. These findings represent the first, of which we are aware, piece of empirical evidence highlighting the role of control rights in shaping corporate financial policies outside of bankruptcy. A fundamental question in financial economics concerns how firms make financing decisions (e. g., Myers (1984)).

40|$|Private debt {{markets are}} characterised by {{covenant}} restrictive but renegotiation-flexible debt contracts as financial intermediaries lending in private debt markets have a comparative advantage over investors in public debt markets in offering such contracts. The two research questions investigated {{in this paper}} are 'What determines the restrictiveness of <b>financial</b> <b>covenants</b> in private debt contracts?' and 'Under what conditions will loan officers waive technical default on financial covenants?' Two behavioural experiments involving loan officers examined these contracting processes in the Australian private debt market.

40|$|I {{examine how}} {{accounting}} conservatism {{relates to the}} design of private debt contracts with consideration of managerial risk preferences embedded in compensation contracts.

More notably, I find evidence of a predicted positive association between the use of collateral and conservatism. I fail to find a predicted positive association, however, between the presence of <b>financial</b> <b>covenants</b> and conservatism when managerial incentives indicate greater risk of asset substitution.

This behavior is more pronounced in firms with high CEO portfolio sensitivity to stock return volatility and firms with high CEO equity ownership.

We show that violations are followed immediately with a decline in acquisitions and capital expenditures, a sharp reduction in leverage and shareholder payouts, and an increase in CEO turnover. The changes in the investment and financing behavior of violating firms coincide with amended credit agreements that contain stronger restrictions on firm decision-making; changes in the management of violating firms suggest that creditors also exert informal influence on corporate governance. Finally, we show that firm operating and stock price performance improve following a violation. We conclude that actions taken by creditors on averag...|$|E

We analyse a sample of 36 recently issued Australian public debt contracts and document a considerable change in the 'package' of <b>financial</b> <b>covenants</b> used in public debt contracts. The covenant package is now less restrictive and the types of covenants used are more heterogenous. We also survey a sample of 41 recent Australian private debt contracts. These contracts contain a greater number, variety and, collectively, more restrictive set of <b>financial</b> <b>covenants</b> than those public debt contracts we survey, supporting theory which suggests that covenant restrictive and renegotiation-flexible contracts are more suited to borrowers contracting with financial intermediaries in private debt markets.

40|$|Parties to lending {{agreements}} {{can create}} priority rankings in two ways: by securing a lender or by protecting the lender's debt with <b>financial</b> <b>covenants.</b> Protected debt turns into high priority debt because the early lender will permit covenant violations only if a later lender agrees to subordinate its claim. The Bankruptcy Code sustains both forms of priority by according secured debt senior status and by enforcing subordination agreements among creditors. The latter priority is not controversial but several recent reform proposals {{would reduce the}} secured lender's priority. This article argues that creditors who lend early in a firm's life are concerned about debt dilution, which can occur even {{when all of the}} borrower's later projects have positive values. It then shows that the equilibrium financial contract for private debt has strong borrowers protecting the early debt with <b>financial</b> <b>covenants,</b> and it suggests that weak borrowers protect the early debt with security. Thus security and <b>financial</b> <b>covenants</b> may be substitutes. "Covenant equilibria" are argued to be efficient. That these equilibria closely resemble "security equilibria," and that arguments for the inefficiency of the secured lender's priority are weak, both argue that the Bankruptcy Code's current respect for both forms of priority should continue. The article also argues that <b>financial</b> <b>covenants</b> should be made binding on later lenders whose advances would cause covenant violations. ...|$|R
40|$|EBITDA, {{earnings}} before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, {{is used by}} {{many firms}} {{as a measure of}} performance in <b>financial</b> <b>covenants</b> and incentive compensation agreements. In 2009, when the FASB, in conjunction with the IASB, likely begins requiring firms to report virtually all leases as capital leases, we expect calculated measures of EBITDA to increase. As a result, firms may find unexpected slack in <b>financial</b> <b>covenants</b> and increases in incentive compensation that are unrelated to real improvements in performance. In anticipation of the change in accounting for leases, companies will want to revise contracts that employ EBITDA to ensure that unanticipated consequences are avoided. This research report examines the effects of lease capitalization on EBITDA in cases where it is employed in financial agreements. Our focus is on companies noted to employ EBITDA in <b>financial</b> <b>covenants</b> or incentive compensation agreements with significant exposure to operating leases.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the determinants of <b>financial</b> <b>covenant</b> thresholds in bank loan agreements and information conveyed through the selection of tight financial covenants. We find that riskier firms and firms with fewer investment opportunities select tighter financial covenants. We also find that selection of tight covenants is associated with improvements in the covenant variable and declines in investment spending and net debt issuance. We observe these changes also for borrowers that do not breach their covenants, suggesting {{that they are not}} simply the result of creditor influence conditional on a technical default. Furthermore, we find that violations of tightly set covenants have significantly less of an impact on the borrower's investment spending and net debt issuance than violations of loosely set covenants. Overall, our results suggest that the selection of tight covenants conveys information concerning future changes in covenant variables, investment and financial policies, and the outcome of covenant violations.

Recent {{evidence shows that}} corporate policies change significantly following <b>financial</b> <b>covenant</b> violations.

In this essay, I investigate whether shareholders engage in activities counter to creditors 2 ̆ 7 interests following violations. I find that the expected negative relation between volatility and investment reverses for firms once they violate a covenant, consistent with risk-shifting behavior. This behavior is more pronounced in firms with high CEO portfolio sensitivity to stock return volatility and firms with high CEO equity ownership.

Overall, these findings suggest that even in the presence of increased creditor control risk shifting still occurs. The prior conclusions that shareholder-debtholder incentives are congruent at violations {{do not appear to be}} the case. Chapter two documents that debt covenants have a profound impact on firms 2 ̆ 7 product market behavior. By examining <b>financial</b> <b>covenant</b> violations from 1996 to 2007, we show that once firms violate a covenant, they experience a substantial decrease in their market share. We also show that firms exhibit poor long-term abnormal returns following covenant violations. In contrast, their rivals grow market share and exhibit significantly positive abnormal returns after their peer firm violates a covenant. Overall, these findings suggest that creditor influence over firms have dramatic effects on product market outcomes and rival firm behavior. Chapter three questions whether managers time the market when they make merger decisions. Merger and acquisition waves seem to correspond with market tides, cresting with bull markets. A contentious debate exists over whether this trend indicates managerial market timing ability. Pseudo market timing, introduced by Schultz (2003, Journal of Finance 58, 483 - 517), provides an alternative hypothesis to explain abnormal performance following events even when managers cannot time the market. I find that acquiring firms which use stocks as the method of payment exhibit negative long-run abnormal returns in event-time, but not in calendar time. Simulations reveal that even when ex ante expected abnormal returns are zero (i. e. managers have no market timing ability), median ex post performance for acquirers is significantly negative when event-time is used. These findings support pseudo market timing as an explanation for acquiring firm underperformance in the context of stock mergers...|$|E

40|$|Drawing on {{previous}} theoretical research, this paper empirically explores {{the effect of}} manager-shareholder incentive alignment, {{as measured by the}} extent of equity compensation, on the pricing of syndicated loan contracts.

I deal with the potential endogeneity of managerial compensation contracts by implementing a Propensity Score Matching methodology. Second, I investigate the effects of ex ante accounting conservatism on loan pricing terms, conditional on the managerial incentive structure. I find that ex ante accounting conservatism decreases loan spreads when managers receive average or below-average equity compensation. However, when managers receive above-average equity compensation, ex ante conservatism leads to banks demanding larger loan spreads as well as fewer and tighter <b>financial</b> <b>covenants.</b> These results provide evidence consistent with banks viewing ex ante conservatism as an instrument for reducing the monitoring value of <b>financial</b> <b>covenants</b> when managers receive aggressive equity compensation...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} inefficiencies {{stemming}} from a firm’s operating flexibility under debt. We find that flexibility in replenishing or liquidating inventory, by providing risk-shifting incentives, could lead to borrowing costs that erase {{more than one-third of}} the firm’s value. In this context, we examine the effectiveness of practical and widely used covenants in restoring firm value by limiting such risk-shifting behavior. We find that simple <b>financial</b> <b>covenants</b> can fully restore value for a firm that possesses a midseason inventory liquidation option. In the presence of added flexibility in replenishing or partially liquidating inventory, <b>financial</b> <b>covenants</b> fail, but simple borrowing base covenants successfully restore firm value. Explicitly characterizing optimal covenant tightness for all these cases, we find that better market conditions, such as lower inventory depreciation rate, higher gross margins, or increased product demand, are typically associated with tighter covenants. Our results suggest that inventory-heavy firms can reap the full benefits of additional operating flexibility, irrespective of their leverage, by entering simple debt contracts of the type commonly employed in practice. For such contracts to be effective, however, firms with enhanced flexibility and/or operating in better markets must also be willing to abide by more and/or tighter covenants...|$|R
