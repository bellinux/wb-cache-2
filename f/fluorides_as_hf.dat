40|$|Objective: This paper {{presents}} the results of one of two eight-week dentin hypersensitivity clinical studies in which the efficacy of a novel toothpaste containing 8. 0 % arginine, calcium carbonate, and 1450 ppm <b>fluoride</b> <b>as</b> sodium monofluorophosphate (MFP) was compared to that of a benchmark commercial toothpaste containing 2 % potassium ion, dosed as 3. 75 % potassium chloride, and 1450 ppm <b>fluoride</b> <b>as</b> sodium <b>fluoride</b> (NaF). Methods: An eight-week clinical study, with eighty patients, was conducted in Rome, Italy using a double-blind, stratified, twotreatment design. Tactile sensitivity assessments, as well as air blast sensitivity assessments, were used to compare the efficacy of the two products. Results: This clinical study showed that the new toothpaste containing 8. 0 % arginine and 1450 ppm <b>fluoride</b> <b>as</b> MFP in a calcium carbonate base provided a significant reduction in dentin hypersensitivity when used over a period of eight weeks. The study also showed that this new arginine toothpaste provided significantly greater reductions (p< 0. 05) in dentin hypersensitivity in response to tactile (37. 0 %, 30. 0 %, and 12. 2 %) and air blast (23. 9 %, 32. 0 %, and 29. 3 %) stimuli than the commercial sensitive toothpaste containing 2 % potassium ion and 1450 ppm <b>fluoride</b> <b>as</b> NaF in a silica base, after two weeks, four weeks, and eight weeks of product use, respectively. Conclusion: A new toothpaste containing 8. 0 % arginine, calcium carbonate, and 1450 ppm <b>fluoride</b> <b>as</b> sodium monofluorophosphate (MFP) provides significantly increased dentin hypersensitivity relief (p< 0. 05) compared to a commercial sensitive toothpaste containing 2 % potassium ion after two weeks, four weeks, and eight weeks of product use...|$|R
