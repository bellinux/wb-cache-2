50|$|Direct {{hydrogen}} cooling {{is employed}} in the stator terminals. The rotor forging is of nickel chromium molybdenum vanadium steel having a minimum yield point of 33.2 ton/in.2. The shaft end which connects to the turbine is deferentially tempered to give additional strength to withstand the severe forces which could be applied under fault conditions on the generator. The first three critical speeds are arranged to be below the running speed. The hydrogen-cooled rotor conductors are formed from silver-bearing <b>hard</b> <b>drawn</b> copper tube. Two tubes in parallel form one conductor and there are six conductors per slot except for the slots adjacent to the pole centres, which contain five. The generator is ventilated by cold gas fed {{to a number of}} radial ducts at the slipring end of the core, which communicate with the axial vent holes in the core and stator teeth. After passing through the axial holes the gas is discharged into the ‘air’ gap through further radial ducts at the turbine end of the core. The gas discharged from the core passes along the ‘air’ gap, together with the hot gas discharged from the outlet holes in the rotor body, to the region between the end windings and a baffle at the slipring end, and thence through one half of each axial cooler to the blower intake. After leaving the blower, the gas is passed through the other halves of the coolers and is delivered to the various inlet regions of the stator core and rotor. Gas is fed to the turbine end of the rotor through axial holes machined in the hub of the blower rotor from an annulus formed between the end bracket and the blower outlet diffuser. Large diameter tubes passing longitudinally through the stator frame connect this annulus to the extreme end section at the slipring end, from which the slipring end of the rotor is fed. The three-stage axial blower mounted on the generator shaft comprises a shaft-mounted sleeve upon which is mounted the bladed rotor disc, a bladed stator casing, a diffuser and an inlet fairing.|$|E
40|$|D. Ing. According to {{literature}} 6 % of South Africa’s {{primary energy consumption}} could be saved if heat pumps were used to their full technical potential. Although there is world-wide interest {{in the use of}} heat pumps and considerable effort has been expended on heat-pump research, heat pumps are not commonly used in South Africa. The objective of this thesis is to determine the possibility of a combined evaporator or condenser with a normal pump. This will reduce cost and space of a normal heat pump and make heat pumps economically more competitive against resistance element geysers. In order to investigate this combination research is done on semicircular heat exchangers, since this is the primary geometry of the heating channels in the condenser pump. Analyses is done experimentally on a standard 28. 58 mm <b>hard</b> <b>drawn</b> copper tube, cut trough the middle, with a 1. 6 mm copper plate in between to obtain a semicircular heat exchanger. Turbulent flow is investigated with the flat side of the semicircular heat exchanger being horizontal or vertical, a spiralled and a s-shape semicircular heat exchanger. In each case the heat transfer coefficient is determined {{with the use of the}} Wilson plot technique. It is found that there is a significant increase in Nusselt number for semicircular heat exchangers above a normal tube-in-tube heat exchanger but the pressure loss coefficient increase with an equal amount...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of two copper alloys with high thermal conductivity, GRCop- 84 and AMZIRC, were compared. These are competing alloys in high temperature, high heat flux {{applications such as}} rocket nozzles. The GRCop- 84 data presented was taken from previous work. The results of new tensile, creep, and compression tests on AMZIRC are presented. Tests were done on as-received <b>hard</b> <b>drawn</b> material, and on material that had been subjected to a heat treatment designed to simulate a brazing operation at 935 C. As-received AMZIRC {{was found to have}} excellent properties at temperatures below 550 C, with room temperature yield and ultimate tensile strengths of about 500 MPa, and ductile failures. By comparison, GRCop- 84 s room temperature tensile yield and ultimate strengths are about 200 and 380 MPa respectively. However, the simulated brazing heat treatment substantially decreased the {{mechanical properties}} of AMZIRC; and the strength of as-received AMZIRC dropped precipitously as test temperatures exceeded 500 C. The properties of GRCop- 84 were not significantly affected by the 935 C heat treatment. As a result, there appear to be advantages to GRCop- 84 over AMZIRC if use or processing temperatures of greater than 500 C are expected. Tensile creep tests were done at 500 and 650 C. At these temperatures, the creep properties of GRCop- 84 were superior to AMZIRC s. At equivalent rupture life and stress, GRCop- 84 was found to have a 150 C temperature advantage over AMZIRC; for equivalent rupture life and temperature GRCop- 84 was two times stronger...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of six highly conductive copper alloys, GRCop- 84, AMZIRC, GlidCop Al- 15, Cu- 1 Cr- 0. 1 Zr, Cu- 0. 9 Cr, and NARloy-Z were compared. Tests were done on as-received <b>hard</b> <b>drawn</b> material, {{and after a}} heat treatment designed to simulate a brazing operation at 935 C. In the as-received condition AMZIRC, GlidCop Al- 15, Cu- 1 Cr- 0. 1 Zr and Cu- 0. 9 Cr had excellent strengths at temperatures below 500 C. However, the brazing heat treatment substantially decreased the {{mechanical properties}} of AMZIRC, Cu- 1 Cr- 0. 1 Zr, Cu- 0. 9 Cr, and NARloy-Z. The properties of GlidCop Al- 15 and GRCop- 84 were not significantly affected by the heat treatment. Thus {{there appear to be}} advantages to GRCop- 84 over AMZIRC, Cu- 1 Cr- 0. 1 Zr, Cu- 0. 9 Cr, and NARloy-Z if use or processing temperatures greater than 500 C are expected. Ductility was lowest in GlidCop Al- 15 and Cu- 0. 9 Cr; reduction in area was particularly low in GlidCop Al- 15 above 500 C, and as- received Cu- 0. 9 Cr was brittle between 500 and 650 C. Tensile creep tests were done at 500 and 650 C; the creep properties of GRCop- 84 were superior to those of brazed AMZIRC, Cu- 1 Cr- 0. 1 Zr, Cu- 0. 9 Cr, and NARloy-Z. In the brazed condition, GRCop- 84 was superior to the other alloys due to its greater strength and creep resistance (compared to AMZIRC, Cu- 1 Cr- 0. 1 Zr, Cu- 0. 9 Cr, and NARloy-Z) and ductility (compared to GlidCop Al- 15) ...|$|E
40|$|The performance, {{strength}} and ductility of prestressed concrete piles, and their connection to pile caps, subjected to severe seismic loading are investigated in this thesis. Knowledge of the {{strength and}} ductility of the pile within its embedded length in the foundation material is of importance due to the large deformations which can occur during an earthquake, particularly at the interface of hard and soft layers of foundation material. Connection details are of interest since high moments, shears and axial forces need {{to be transferred to}} pile caps during earthquake loading. Two series of tests of piles and their connections, and accompanying analyses, were conducted. Design tables and charts were derived. The first test series consisted of six full scale octagonal prestressed concrete piles, confined spirally with either Grade 275 steel or <b>hard</b> <b>drawn</b> (Grade 485) steel wire and having various confinement levels, tested under axial load and cyclic flexure. Results of the theoretical analysis were compared with the experimental data. It was found that properly detailed prestressed concrete piles without additional nonprestressed longitudinal steel can sustain large displacement ductility factors without losing their lateral load carrying capacity significantly if confined according to full ductility. The second test series consisted of six full scale octagonal piles connected to full scale reinforced pile caps. The piles were either fully or partially prestressed. Three types of pile to pile cap connection were investigated, namely the precast embedded type, the stripped pile head type, and the type where steel dowel bars are used as the connection device. Theoretical analyses were used to compare the experimental data. The connection details investigated were found to give satisfactory performance. Finally, tables and charts obtained for the pile properties are presented for design purposes. The design tables are used to assess the enhancement factors of pile cross sections within the length or at the interface of the connection at the pile cap. The design charts are used to calculate the yield curvatures as well as the available curvatures and available curvature ductility factors. Recommendations for future research are proposed to complement the work already done up to this stage...|$|E
40|$|Tube-in-tube heat {{exchangers}} {{are commonly used}} in many applications and are generally operated in a counterflow configuration. Unfortunately, existing correlations developed for heat transfer and pressure drop predictions for the outer annular flow passage {{have been found to}} sometimes produce large discrepancies between them. In this experimental study research was performed to obtain experimental data with the lowest possible uncertainties associated with it in order to validate existing correlations and to identify the core aspects that influence the heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics in annular flow passages that have neither uniform wall temperatures nor uniform wall heat fluxes. Focus was placed on the turbulent flow regime and temperature and pressure drop measurements were taken at different fluid velocities, annular diameter ratios, and inlet temperature of water. Four horizontal test sections with annular diameter ratios of 0. 327, 0. 386, 0. 409 and 0. 483 and hydraulic diameter of 17. 00, 22. 98, 20. 20 and 26. 18 respectively were constructed from <b>hard</b> <b>drawn</b> copper tubes. The test sections were equipped with industry standard inlet and outlet configurations and had pressure drop lengths of between 5. 02 m and 5. 03 m and heat transfer lengths of between 5. 06 m and 5. 10 m. This resulted in length to hydraulic diameter ratios of between 194 and 300. A wide range of annular flow rates were considered and Reynolds numbers ranges from 15 000 to 45 000 were covered for both heated and cooled annulus operating conditions. Specific attention was given to the influence of the inlet fluid temperature. For heated annulus cases an inlet temperature range of 10 °C to 30 °C was covered, while for cooled annulus cases an inlet temperature range of 30 °C to 50 °C was covered. Since one of the main focuses {{of the study was to}} provide accurate temperature measurement, especially local wall temperature measurements of the inner tube, an in-situ calibration technique of the wall thermocouples were used. This enabled continuous verification of the measurement accuracy and allowed re-evaluation of readings. Based on the processed experimental results, it was found that the direction of heat transfer did not affect the average heat transfer coefficient across the inner tube wall. Longitudinal local heat transfer coefficients were found to not be constant along the test section length, but continually decreased towards the annulus outlet, indicating undeveloped thermal flow. Heated annuli had a larger average heat transfer coefficients compared to cooled annuli at similar Reynolds numbers. This can be attributed to a dependency on fluid properties, which were less at higher bulk temperatures. Analysis showed although both had about the same local Nusselt numbers at the exit region, the heated annuli had much larger Nusselt numbers at the entrance region of the test section. The friction factor was mostly affected by the fluid velocity, but at low velocities higher friction factors were detected when inlet temperatures were lower. For the data sets considered in this study, the average Nusselt number and the Colburn j-factor decreased somewhat with increase in annular diameter ratio. It seemed that the friction factor was also not influenced by the annular diameter ratio. Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017.
