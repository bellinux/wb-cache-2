5|$|For {{substances}} in solution the <b>isoelectric</b> <b>point</b> (pI) {{is defined as}} the pH at which the sum, weighted by charge value, of concentrations of positively charged species is equal to the weighted sum of concentrations of negatively charged species. In the case that there is one species of each type, the <b>isoelectric</b> <b>point</b> can be obtained directly from the pK values. Take the example of glycine, defined as AH. There are two dissociation equilibria to consider.|$|E
5|$|At pH values {{between the}} two pKa values, the {{zwitterion}} predominates, but coexists in dynamic equilibrium with small amounts of net negative and net positive ions. At the exact midpoint {{between the two}} pKa values, the trace amount of net negative and trace of net positive ions exactly balance, so that average net charge of all forms present is zero. This pH {{is known as the}} <b>isoelectric</b> <b>point</b> pI, so pI = ½(pKa1 + pKa2). The individual amino acids all have slightly different pKa values, so have different isoelectric points. For amino acids with charged side chains, the pKa of the side chain is involved. Thus for Asp, Glu with negative side chains, pI = ½(pKa1 + pKaR), where pKaR is the side chain pKa. Cysteine also has potentially negative side chain with pKaR = 8.14, so pI should be calculated as for Asp and Glu, even though the side chain is not significantly charged at neutral pH. For His, Lys, and Arg with positive side chains, pI = ½(pKaR + pKa2). Amino acids have zero mobility in electrophoresis at their <b>isoelectric</b> <b>point,</b> although this behaviour is more usually exploited for peptides and proteins than single amino acids. Zwitterions have minimum solubility at their <b>isoelectric</b> <b>point</b> and some amino acids (in particular, with non-polar side chains) can be isolated by precipitation from water by adjusting the pH to the required <b>isoelectric</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E

40|$|Although the {{distribution}} of protein <b>isoelectric</b> <b>points</b> is multi-modal, large proteins show <b>isoelectric</b> <b>points</b> less variable than small proteins and their <b>isoelectric</b> <b>points</b> tend to converge to a unique value, close to the pH of the milieu in which the proteins are functional, {{as far as the}} protein dimension increases. This study demonstrates that large proteins, which contain more than a single domain, do have <b>isoelectric</b> <b>points</b> less variable than small proteins, which contains a single domain. However, {{the distribution}} of the <b>isoelectric</b> <b>points</b> of the single domains, contained in large proteins, resembles that of small proteins, which contain a single domain. Thus, large proteins can be soluble even if their pI is very close to the pH of the milieu, in which they perform their function, since they can contain several domains, the electrostatic properties of each of which mirror those of small proteins...|$|R

40|$|The NS protein of {{vesicular}} stomatitis virus {{is the only}} phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein. The amount of NS phosphorylation appears to regulate {{the activity of the}} protein in the transcription of the virus genome. Several methods have been used to separate NS subspecies containing different amounts of phosphate, but the relationships among the subspecies separated by different workers have been unclear. We report that the <b>isoelectric</b> <b>points</b> of NS molecules were abnormally acidic in some commercial ampholytes, but favorable ampholytes resolved multiple phosphorylated NS subspecies with <b>isoelectric</b> <b>points</b> ranging from pH 6. 8 to 7. 2. The most highly phosphorylated NS molecules had more acidic <b>isoelectric</b> <b>points,</b> and they exhibited greater electrophoretic mobilities in two previously employed electrophoretic systems...|$|R
5|$|A {{knowledge}} of pKa values {{is important for}} the quantitative treatment of systems involving acid–base equilibria in solution. Many applications exist in biochemistry; for example, the pKa values of proteins and amino acid side chains are of major importance for the activity of enzymes and the stability of proteins. Protein pKa values cannot always be measured directly, but may be calculated using theoretical methods. Buffer solutions are used extensively to provide solutions at or near the physiological pH for the study of biochemical reactions; the design of these solutions depends on a {{knowledge of}} the pKa values of their components. Important buffer solutions include MOPS, which provides a solution with pH 7.2, and tricine, which is used in gel electrophoresis. Buffering {{is an essential part of}} acid base physiology including acid–base homeostasis, and is key to understanding disorders such as acid–base imbalance. The <b>isoelectric</b> <b>point</b> of a given molecule is a function of its pK values, so different molecules have different isoelectric points. This permits a technique called isoelectric focusing, which is used for separation of proteins by 2-D gel polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.|$|E
5|$|To {{perform in}} vitro analysis, a protein must be {{purified}} {{away from other}} cellular components. This process usually begins with cell lysis, in which a cell's membrane is disrupted and its internal contents released into a solution known as a crude lysate. The resulting mixture can be purified using ultracentrifugation, which fractionates the various cellular components into fractions containing soluble proteins; membrane lipids and proteins; cellular organelles, and nucleic acids. Precipitation by a method known as salting out can concentrate the proteins from this lysate. Various types of chromatography are then used to isolate the protein or proteins of interest based on properties such as molecular weight, net charge and binding affinity. The level of purification can be monitored using various types of gel electrophoresis if the desired protein's molecular weight and <b>isoelectric</b> <b>point</b> are known, by spectroscopy if the protein has distinguishable spectroscopic features, or by enzyme assays if the protein has enzymatic activity. Additionally, proteins can be isolated according their charge using electrofocusing.|$|E

40|$|High-performance {{electromigration}} separation methods, capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and capillary {{isoelectric focusing}} (CIEF), {{have been applied}} to physico-chemical characterization of new synthetic low-molecular mass markers of <b>isoelectric</b> <b>points.</b> Amphoteric compounds {{on the basis of}} aminomethylnitrophenols, their derivatives and other structurally related substances were analyzed by CZE in a series of background electrolytes in a wide pH range, 1. 86 - 11. 18. From the measured pH dependencies of effective electrophoretic mobilities of analytes (beforehand corrected to reference temperature of 25 řC), their <b>isoelectric</b> <b>points</b> (pI) were determined. In addition, using the non-linear regression analysis of the above dependencies, acid-base dissociation constants (pKa) of ionogenic groups of selected analytes were calculated. Subsequently, the analytes with sharply defined <b>isoelectric</b> <b>points</b> were analyzed by CIEF. CIEF confirmed applicability of these compounds as markers of <b>isoelectric</b> <b>points</b> for calibration of pH gradient in CIEF in the determination of pI of amphoteric compounds, especially peptides and proteins. The determined pKa values of ionogenic groups in particular compounds will be utilized in the development of new pI markers with desired pI values...|$|R

25|$|The <b>isoelectric</b> <b>point</b> (pI) is the pH of a {{solution}} at which the net primary charge of a protein becomes zero. At {{a solution}} pH that is above the pI {{the surface of the}} protein is predominantly negatively charged and therefore like-charged molecules will exhibit repulsive forces. Likewise, at a solution pH that is below the pI, the surface of the protein is predominantly positively charged and repulsion between proteins occurs. However, at the pI the negative and positive charges cancel, repulsive electrostatic forces are reduced and the attraction forces predominate. The attraction forces will cause aggregation and precipitation. The pI of most proteins is in the pH range of 4–6. Mineral acids, such as hydrochloric and sulfuric acid are used as precipitants. The greatest disadvantage to <b>isoelectric</b> <b>point</b> precipitation is the irreversible denaturation caused by the mineral acids. For this reason <b>isoelectric</b> <b>point</b> precipitation is most often used to precipitate contaminant proteins, rather than the target protein. The precipitation of casein during cheesemaking, or during production of sodium caseinate, is an isoelectric precipitation.|$|E

The pseudorabies virus strains exhibited great mobility {{in the electric}} field typical of viruses of the herpes group. Strains were considered electrophoretically homogeneous based on their respective <b>isoelectric</b> <b>points.</b> Maximal virus infectivity was concentrated in reproducible, stationary zones representing 73 to 86 % of the total virus infectivity initially applied throughout the gels. All pseudorabies virus strains during processing and after isoelectric focusing retained their ability as whole complete particles to typically infect porcine kidney cell cultures. Virus from gel fractions produces foci in cell cultures that specifically reacted with pseudorabies virus fluorescent antibody conjugate. Prevention of foci could be demonstrated by neutralizing with pseudorabies virus monospecific antiserum.

Since the large subunits of fraction 1 protein are coded by chloroplast DNA, the difference in their primary structure reflects the structural changes of the chloroplast genes containing the coding information.

25|$|Alginate, carboxymethycellulose, {{polyacrylic}} acid, {{tannic acid}} and polyphosphates can form extended networks between protein molecules in solution. The {{effectiveness of these}} polyelectrolytes depend on the pH of the solution. Anionic polyelectrolytes are used at pH values less than the <b>isoelectric</b> <b>point.</b> Cationic polyelectrolytes are at pH values above the pI. It {{is important to note}} that an excess of polyelectrolytes will cause the precipitate to dissolve back into the solution. An example of polyelectrolyte flocculation is the removal of protein cloud from beer wort using Irish moss.|$|E
25|$|Most of the charged {{impurities}} {{are usually}} anions such as nucleic acids and endotoxins. These can be separated by ion exchange chromatography. Either cation exchange chromatography is used {{at a low}} enough pH that the desired antibody binds to the column while anions flow through, or anion exchange chromatography is used at a high enough pH that the desired antibody flows through the column while anions bind to it. Various proteins can also be separated along with the anions based on their <b>isoelectric</b> <b>point</b> (pI). In proteins, the <b>isoelectric</b> <b>point</b> (pI) {{is defined as the}} pH at which a protein has no net charge. When the pH > pI, a protein has a net negative charge and when the pH < pI, a protein has a net positive charge. For example, albumin has a pI of 4.8, which is significantly lower than that of most monoclonal antibodies, which have a pI of 6.1. Thus, at a pH between 4.8 and 6.1, the average charge of albumin molecules is likely to be more negative, while mAbs molecules are positively charged and hence it is possible to separate them. Transferrin, on the other hand, has a pI of 5.9, so it cannot be easily separated by this method. A difference in pI of at least 1 is necessary for a good separation.|$|E

Like other type 2 cystatins, it has two disulfide bonds. Around 50% of the molecules carry a hydroxylated proline. Cystatin C forms dimers (molecule pairs) by exchanging subdomains; in the paired state, each half is made up of the long alpha helix and one beta strand of one partner, and four beta strands of the other partner.|$|E
40|$|Microbial {{adhesion}} to hydrocarbons (MATH) and microelectrophoresis {{were done}} in 10 mM potassium phosphate solutions to characterize the surfaces of thermophilic dairy streptococci, isolated from pasteurizers. Regardless of whether they were grown (in M 17 broth) with lactose, sucrose, or glucose added, strains were relatively hydrophilic (showing low initial removal rates by hexadecane) and slightly negatively charged. A tendency exists for cells grown with sucrose added to be more hydrophilic than cells grown with glucose or lactose added. Also, the lowest <b>isoelectric</b> <b>points,</b> i. e., the pH values for which the zeta potentials are zero, were measured for strains with glucose added to the growth medium. The <b>isoelectric</b> <b>points</b> for the strains were all rather high, between pH 3 and 5, indicative of protein-rich surfaces, although X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy did not measure excessively large amounts of nitrogen on the cell surfaces. Both MATH and microelectrophoresis were done {{as a function of}} pH. Maxima in hydrophobicity were observed at certain pH values. Usually these pH values were in the range of the <b>isoelectric</b> <b>points</b> of the cells. Thus it appears that MATH measures an interplay of hydrophobicity and electrostatic interactions. MATH measures solely hydrophobicity only when electrostatic interactions are absent, i. e., close to the <b>isoelectric</b> <b>points</b> of the cells. Considering that these thermophilic streptococci are all rather hydrophilic, a possible pathway to prevent fouling in the pasteurization process might be to render the heat exchanger plates of the pasteurizer more hydrophobic...|$|R

The CCDC130 protein is rich in charged amino acids and deficient in uncharged, non-polar amino acids. Mobyle @ Pasteur predicted CCDC130 to be extremely hydrophilic due to {{the large numbers of}} charged and polar amino acids, with no site scoring above zero on the hydrophobicity graph and some sites reaching as low as -6 (F180). There is a region in the coiled coil domain (182-214) in which 14 of 18 amino acids are charged. SAPS analysis predicted that this protein would be unstable. Due to its high hydrophilicity, this protein definitely does not contain transmembrane segments.|$|E
25|$|Sanofi-Aventis {{developed}} glargine as a longer-lasting insulin analogue, {{and markets}} {{it under the}} trade name Lantus. It was created by modifying three amino acids. Two positively charged arginine molecules {{were added to the}} C-terminus of the B-chain, and they shift the <b>isoelectric</b> <b>point</b> from 5.4 to 6.7, making glargine more soluble at a slightly acidic pH and less soluble at a physiological pH. Replacing the acid-sensitive asparagine at position 21 in the A-chain by glycine is needed to avoid deamination and dimerization of the arginine residue. These three structural changes and formulation with zinc result in a prolonged action when compared with biosynthetic human insulin. When the pH 4.0 solution is injected, most of the material precipitates and is not bioavailable. A small amount is immediately available for use, and the remainder is sequestered in subcutaneous tissue. As the glargine is used, small amounts of the precipitated material will move into solution in the bloodstream, and the basal level of insulin will be maintained up to 24 hours. The onset of action of subcutaneous insulin glargine is somewhat slower than NPH human insulin. It is clear solution as there is no zinc in formula.|$|E
25|$|Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (C12H25NaO4S; mW: 288.38) (only used in {{denaturing}} protein gels) is {{a strong}} detergent agent used to denature native proteins to individual polypeptides. This denaturation, which {{is referred to as}} reconstructive denaturation, is not accomplished by the total linearization of the protein, but instead, through a conformational change to a combination of random coil and α helix secondary structures. When a protein mixture is heated to 100°C in presence of SDS, the detergent wraps around the polypeptide backbone. It binds to polypeptides in a constant weight ratio of 1.4 g SDS/g of polypeptide. In this process, the intrinsic charges of polypeptides become negligible when compared to the negative charges contributed by SDS. Thus polypeptides after treatment become rod-like structures possessing a uniform charge density, that is same net negative charge per unit weight. The electrophoretic mobilities of these proteins is a linear function of the logarithms of their molecular weights. Without SDS, different proteins with similar molecular weights would migrate differently due to differences in mass-charge ratio, as each protein has an <b>isoelectric</b> <b>point</b> and molecular weight particular to its primary structure. This is known as native PAGE. Adding SDS solves this problem, as it binds to and unfolds the protein, giving a near uniform negative charge {{along the length of the}} polypeptide.|$|E

40|$|Post-translational {{modifications}} (PTMs) {{are known}} to regulate biological processes by controlling protein function. The effect of a PTM on protein function depends critically on the position {{and the number of}} modifications. While there are convenient methods available to qualitatively examine modifications like phosphorylation, glycosylation, acetylation and methylation, methods available for their quantitative assessment are cumbersome. We have developed a new tool that allows quantitation of the number of phosphorylation events in proteins with ease. The ProteoMod tool depends on shifts in the <b>isoelectric</b> <b>points</b> of proteins upon post-translational change. The extent of shift exhibited upon phosphorylation is algorithmically converted into the number of phosphorylations conferred. The validity of ProteoMod was confirmed by examining proteins with previously known number of phosphorylations. The list of proteins examined included HSP 27, HSP 70 and tumor suppressor p 53. The approach can also be applied to estimate modifications like acetylation, methylation and sialylation in proteins. We analyzed shifts in <b>isoelectric</b> <b>points</b> due to sialylation events in N-glycoproteins.
