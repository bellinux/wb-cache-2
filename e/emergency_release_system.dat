40|$|Investigations {{on direct}} contact heat {{transfer}} between two fluid phases with simultaneous {{change of phase}} in submerged condensers have been extended {{to the effect of}} non condensible gases in bubble condensation in an immiscible liquid, in order to enlarge the basis for the design of detention equipments in <b>emergency</b> pressure <b>release</b> <b>systems.</b> In an experimental work the dependency of the condenser efficiency on the main variables (steam throughput, content of inertia, height and temperature of cooling columns, bubble dispersion) has been studied using condenser columns up to 3 m height and 100 - 300 mm inner diameter. At a cooling liquid column height of #>=# 0. 5 m thermodynamic equilibrium between gas and cooling liquid is achieved. Gas contents in condensed systems can be described by the conventional equations, e. g. the equation by Ajita/Yoshida.
