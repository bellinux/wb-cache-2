25|$|Dressed up as a stereotypical nerd in his basement, the Nerd {{reviews the}} game with his {{trademark}} eyeglasses and white collared shirt with a pocket full of pens, high <b>khaki</b> <b>pants</b> and white socks and loafers, while sometimes being bombarded by guest characters from video games and popular culture as well. These guests often provide additional commentary on the games, mock the Nerd's anguish, and act as parodies of the characters from {{which they had been}} derived. In response to them and to the games, the Nerd derives comic appeal from excessive and surrealistic use of fantasy scenarios, anger, and consumption of Rolling Rock (in addition to Yuengling in later videos) while reviewing video games. His anger and profanity over these bad games would sometimes climax in him destroying whole game cartridges, simulating defacation on, burning, and sometimes even crushing entire video game consoles.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} {{shot on the}} streets of Los Angeles and in a studio soundstage. It begins with Frusciante {{standing}} alone on a pedestal wearing a red-and-white-striped collared shirt, brown <b>khaki</b> <b>pants,</b> brown shoes, and a purple, green and multicolored chullo, with white stitched wolves in the middle. He plays a 1966 Ocean Turquoise Fender Jaguar behind the backdrop of a desert and an inverted cloudy sky. His shadow is projected on the left and right of where he stands. Frusciante's then-girlfriend, Toni Oswald, selected his clothes that day. Frusciante remembers Van Sant's surprised, though favorable, reaction: [...] "when I got [...] Gus Van Sant was just looking at me and going 'God I'm so glad you wore that hat. I'm so glad you wore that shirt. Oh! Those pants are so great I'm so glad you wore those'". The video marks a significant shift in Frusciante's on-camera behavior; he no longer wished to jump around fervently as he had done in the band's prior music videos.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Khaki</b> <b>pant</b> {{has been}} around since 1846 when Englishman Sir Henry Lumsden dyed his cotton pajamas to create a uniform more {{suitable}} to the climate of India, thus creating khakis.

The pants have always had a go-with-anything motto that was really embraced by Dockers when the brand launched in 1986.

[...] Often the theme was related to California, with palm tree props and the band members wearing beach party outfits, including Hawaiian shirts and <b>khaki</b> <b>pants.</b> Occasionally, the band would simply appear in black suits with white dress shirts or dress up in chef costumes, cowboy suits or as the Village People.|$|E
