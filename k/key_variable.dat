5|$|The General Theory {{argues that}} demand, not supply, is the <b>key</b> <b>variable</b> {{governing}} the {{overall level of}} economic activity. Aggregate demand, which equals total un-hoarded income in a society, {{is defined by the}} sum of consumption and investment. In a state of unemployment and unused production capacity, one can only enhance employment and total income by first increasing expenditures for either consumption or investment. Without government intervention to increase expenditure, an economy can remain trapped in a low employment equilibrium – the demonstration of this possibility has been described as the revolutionary formal achievement of the work.|$|E

Debris flux and sediment recycling at the glacier grounding-line, particularly rapid in the temperate glaciers of Alaska, can alter this depth, {{acting as a}} second-order control on terminus fluctuations. This effect contributes to the insensitivity of a glacier to climate when its terminus is either retreating or advancing in deep water.|$|E

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{tension in}} statistical disclosure control (SDC) of microdata is the trade-off between {{the protection of}} individual respondents {{and the release of}} enough information for statistical inferences. We consider microdata that include <b>key</b> <b>variables</b> that contain identifying information and target variables that include sensitive information. Releasing the original data may expose some individuals in the sample to high risk of disclosure; deleting <b>key</b> <b>variables</b> is a common approach, but this loses information for some statistical analysis. This paper proposes selective multiple imputation of <b>key</b> <b>variables</b> (SMIKe) as an alternative SDC technique between those two extremes, and applies SMIKe to categorical <b>key</b> <b>variables</b> and continuous nonkey variables {{in the context of the}} general location model. Keys of sensitive cases and a mixing set of selected nonsensitive cases are multiply imputed from their posterior predictive distributions, and each set of imputed keys is released to the public with the rest of the data. The size of mixing set can be used to control the trade-off between information loss and protection. Data analysis is conducted using multiple imputation methods with some necessary correction in the case of SMIKe. Simulation studies and an application of SMIKe to the 1995 Health and Ways of Living Survey in Alameda County are also presented...|$|R
