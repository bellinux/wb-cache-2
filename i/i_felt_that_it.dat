5|$|In 1907, Besant {{became the}} {{president}} of the Theosophical Society globally, and set to work with a major expansion of the organisation's headquarters at Adyar, in what was then, Madras. When it was announced that Besant would undertake a speaking tour of Australia in 1908, she was expected to stay with Fuller while in Perth. Some months later in 1908, Fuller left Western Australia and travelled to India, staying at Adyar. Of her time in India, Fuller wrote:I went in search not only of beauty, and light, and colour, and the picturesqueness in general, which delight the eye and emotions of all artists—but of something deeper—something less easily expressed. I spent {{two and a half years}} in a community that is quite unique—perhaps the most cosmopolitan settlement in the world—the headquarters of the Theosophical Society... Well, I painted there, of course, but my art was undergoing a change, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could not satisfy me unless it became so much greater.|$|E
500|$|Charity Wakefield {{successfully}} {{auditioned for}} the role of Marianne Dashwood. The actress revealed, [...] "Marianne is the embodiment of youth and hope. I was so excited to be offered the part because <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a role which I could really attack. I understand her character and feel that we have lots in common." [...] Dan Stevens was chosen to play Edward Ferrars, Elinor's love interest. The actor revealed to a BBC journalist that he had really wanted the part and was excited by the challenge of the character. Stevens became ill with tonsillitis during the shoot, and quipped that there are very few shots of him in full health still in the series.|$|E
500|$|When Diane first played me {{what she}} had begun with the song, I needed no convincing about the record... it was about sharing that part of myself with the world... We {{talked a lot about}} what I felt the song needed in order to reach as many young people as possible. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> needed to not stay in a purely {{emotional}} state, but {{that it was going to}} somehow grow throughout the performance and the song and by the end, kind of be full of rage. I feel like what this song accomplishes is women—or men—rising to say, 'You think you can hurt me? You don't know about power. Because after what you did to me, you don't even know how much stronger I am.' ...|$|E

500|$|Dunglass {{had shown}} little {{interest}} in politics while at Eton or Oxford. He had not joined the Oxford Union as budding politicians usually did. However, as heir to the family estates he was doubtful {{about the prospect of}} life as a country gentleman: [...] "I was always rather discontented with this role and felt it wasn't going to be enough." [...] His biographer David Dutton believes that Dunglass became interested in politics because of the widespread unemployment and poverty in the Scottish lowlands where his family lived. Later in his career, when he had become Prime Minister, Dunglass (by then Sir Alec Douglas-Home) wrote in a memorandum: [...] "I went into politics because <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a form of public service and that as nearly a generation of politicians had been cut down in the first war those who had anything to give in the way of leadership ought to do so." [...] His political thinking was influenced by that of Noel Skelton, a member of the Unionist party (as the Conservatives were called in Scotland between 1912 and 1965). Skelton advocated [...] "a property-owning democracy", based on share-options for workers and industrial democracy. Dunglass was not persuaded by the socialist ideal of public ownership. He shared Skelton's view that [...] "what everybody owns nobody owns".|$|E
2500|$|In the twenties, when no dictatorships existed, I {{advocated}} that {{refusing to}} go to war would make war improper. But as soon as coercive conditions appeared in certain nations, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would weaken the less aggressive nations vis-à-vis [...] the more aggressive ones.|$|E
2500|$|He stopped wearing {{virtually}} all his gold, {{one of his}} identifying marks, after helping with the cleanup after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. He said, [...] "As a Christian, when I saw other people lose their lives and lose their land and property ... <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be a sin before God for me to continue wearing my gold. I felt it would be insensitive and disrespectful {{to the people who}} lost everything, so I stopped wearing my gold." ...|$|E

2500|$|Roosevelt disliked Lindbergh's outspoken {{opposition}} to his administration's interventionist policies, telling Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, [...] "If I should die tomorrow, I {{want you to}} know this, I am absolutely convinced Lindbergh is a Nazi." [...] In 1941 he wrote to Secretary of War Henry Stimson: [...] "When I read Lindbergh's speech <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could not have been better put if it had been written by Goebbels himself. What a pity that this youngster has completely abandoned his belief in our form of government and has accepted Nazi methods because apparently they are efficient." ...|$|E
2500|$|During World War II and the Korean War, Marian Anderson entertained {{troops in}} {{hospitals}} and bases. In 1943, she sang at Constitution Hall {{at the invitation of}} the DAR to an integrated audience as part of a benefit for the American Red Cross. She said of the event, [...] "When I finally walked onto the stage of Constitution Hall, I felt no different than I had in other halls. There was no sense of triumph. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a beautiful concert hall and I was very happy to sing there." [...] By contrast, the District of Columbia Board of Education continued to bar her from using the high school auditorium in the District of Columbia.|$|E
2500|$|... "Even Flow" [...] {{features}} lyrics {{written by}} vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by guitarist Stone Gossard. Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "I {{know it was}} a great song all along, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was the best song that we got the worst take of on the first record. There were a hundred takes on that song, and we just never nailed it." [...] Drummer Dave Krusen said, [...] "I was pretty green back then and 'Even Flow' suffered from too much fluctuation." [...] He added that [...] "it was really tough for me. I don't know why. Not sure why we didn't use that one from the demo as well, but I know it felt better." [...] Guitarist Mike McCready stated, [...] "We did 'Even Flow' about 50, 70 times. I swear to God it was a nightmare. We played that thing over and over until we hated each other. I still don't think Stone is satisfied with how it came out." ...|$|E

2500|$|White founded Third Man Records in 2001. However, it was {{not until}} after he moved to Nashville that White {{purchased}} a space in 2009 to house his label. He explained, [...] "For the longest time I did not want to have my own studio gear, mostly because with the White Stripes I wanted to have the constriction of going into a studio and having a set time of 10 days or two weeks to finish an album, and using whatever gear they happen to have there. After 10 to 15 years of recording like that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was finally time for me to have my own place to produce music, and have exactly what I want in there: the exact tape machines, the exact microphones, the exact amplifiers that I like, and so on." [...] Using the slogan [...] "Your Turntable’s Not Dead," [...] Third Man also presses vinyl records, for the artists on its label, for White's own musical ventures, as well as for third parties for hire.|$|E
2500|$|Upon signing, Kewell said, [...] "I {{wanted to}} move on and this is the best way. I can't wait to get started, it's just what I'm looking forward to, a new challenge." [...] His {{transfer}} to Galatasaray provoked strong criticism from fans and teammates of his former club Leeds United as he was a Leeds player when two of their fans were killed in clashes before a UEFA Cup semi-final against Galatasaray in Istanbul in April 2000. Kewell responded and in an open letter he stated, [...] "I chose the No 19 shirt when I signed for Galatasaray SK as a sign of respect for Leeds because that was the number I got when I first became a regular member of the Leeds United starting XI. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> might be a way to demonstrate that I had not forgotten where it all started and I was hoping that in a small way it would help the healing process of the tragedy that occurred on 5 April 2000. To blame the Galatasaray club for the tragedy in Istanbul is simply wrong and discriminatory." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a display}} of Parker's work ethic, work on the next Tame Impala album Lonerism had already started before Innerspeaker was even {{released}}. Lonerism was released on 5 October 2012 to widespread critical acclaim, winning many Album of the Year awards {{from the likes of}} NME Magazine, Rolling Stone Magazine and Triple J. Lonerism marks an extension of Parker's music, featuring synths and poppier melodies, and also a more lavish, lush and expansive sound. Commenting on the new-found sound, Parker said that [...] " [...] will be the kind of music that I felt as though I wanted to make during Innerspeaker, but <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was too much of a}} jump. Back when I was doing Innerspeaker, I felt like I should make an album with only guitars, and use no synths, because I felt like it was a compromise to what we do. But I now know that it's not." [...] At the ARIA Music Awards of 2015 he won two trophies, Engineer of the Year and Producer of the Year, for his work on Tame Impala's Currents (July 2015); the group won three further categories at the ceremony: Album of the Year, Best Group and Best Rock Album.|$|E

"I {{told her}} that I had been {{watching}} for four days, feeling sure that the count was hidden in the palace; but hers was the first face that showed anxiety, and that, when I saw her buying salve at the apothecary's, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was she who was sheltering the count." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No,--upon {{the whole}} she did not. <b>I</b> always <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was touch and go. She might {{or she might}} not.

60|$|This speech both {{surprised}} and embarrassed me, for I {{had never before}} attempted anything {{in the way of}} exposition. <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> however, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would never do for a man in charge of an outpost in the Great Nor'-West to exhibit weakness on any point, whatever he might feel; I therefore resolved to comply.|$|R
2500|$|I {{definitely}} {{had a story}} for it – a specific story – that's why <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was important for her and I to co-direct this particular video and song and she completely got it. She got my vision for it. She [...] got where I was trying to go and what she brings to the table is so incredible and she's so creative and outstanding. And I always {{have a great time}} working with her. There was no ego involved, you know, me - that was the first video that I'd ever {{stepped up to the plate}} to literally co-direct. I'd always been very opinionated and very you know, I always voice my ideas and whatnot in my videos, but this was the first one I actually took credit for in co-directing. And she was just so great and generous in teaching me some of the ropes and learning about the different camera angles and you know, all the facets and details that go into making a video. So, she was really great and we had such fun with that. [...] And she's amazing. I can't you know, she came to the set dressed in different outfits that related to the circus everyday, so she's such an imaginative, creative spirit that I just have such fun working with energy like that.|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Frazier's {{testimony}} [...] adds, [...] "Just as I said in {{the case}} of Mr. Curly, my initial feeling was, when I first heard about this, that the facts had not been established and we needed to be careful to make sure we understood the facts. As I was in -- in that 48-hour time period read the grand jury presentment, I reached the conclusion that given what had become public about the issues leading up to the presentment and given what was {{said in the}} presentment itself about Coach Paterno's testimony and about what the graduate student said to Coach Paterno, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would not send the right message if Coach Paterno was able to lead the football team out onto the field of play under those circumstances. So I didn't change my mind {{on the question of whether}} we had established all the key facts that related to Coach Paterno's involvement and/or responsibility. But I had reached the conclusion that, from the standpoint of what the University's values would be interpreted to be by the broader public, that what was known was sufficiently serious as it relates to child sexual abuse that it would send the wrong message about our values as a University if Coach Paterno were allowed to coach as though none of this had ever happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ellen Burstyn {{was still}} in the midst of filming The Exorcist when Warner Bros. {{executives}} expressed interest in working with her on another project. Burstyn later recalled, [...] "It was early in the woman's movement, and we were all just waking up and having a look at the pattern of our lives and wanting it to be different… I wanted to make a different kind of film. A film from a woman's point of view, but a woman that I recognized, that I knew. And not just myself, but my friends, what we were all going through at the time. So my agent found Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore… When I read it I liked it a lot. I sent it to Warner Brothers and they agreed to do it. Then they asked who I wanted to direct it. I said that I didn't know, but I wanted somebody new and young and exciting. I called Francis Coppola and asked who was young and exciting and he said 'Go look at a movie called Mean Streets and see what you think.' It hadn't been released yet, so I booked a screening to look at it and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was exactly what…Alice needed, because [...] was a wonderful script and well written, but for my taste it was a little slick. You know – in a good way, in a kind of Doris Day–Rock Hudson kind of way. I wanted something a bit more gritty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It has {{all turned}} out right, John, {{and there is}} no {{occasion}} for you to worry over the past. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would do me good some day, so I stuck to it in spite of your scolding, and you will allow that I was never backward in turning out when you wanted me for the boat.” ...|$|R
60|$|A {{volley of}} words seemed {{trembling}} on Father Adrian's lips; yet {{he did not}} speak. We waited for the storm to burst; we waited till I could bear the silence no longer, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> if <b>it</b> was not broken I should go mad. So I drew near to him, and spoke a single word in his ear. Then I glided back to Paul's side.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I really can't say,' replied Eugene, {{shaking his}} head blankly, after pausing again to reconsider. 'At times I have thought yes; at other times I have thought no.

2500|$|Tsar Nicholas II, {{the last}} Emperor of Russia, {{reported}} witnessing {{what he called}} [...] "a fiery ball" [...] while {{in the company of}} his grandfather, Tsar Alexander II: [...] "Once my parents were away," [...] recounted the Tsar, [...] "and I was at the all-night vigil with my grandfather in the small church in Alexandria. During the service there was a powerful thunderstorm, streaks of lightning flashed one after the other, and {{it seemed as if the}} peals of thunder would shake even the church and the whole world to its foundations. Suddenly it became quite dark, a blast of wind from the open door blew out the flame of the candles which were lit in front of the iconostasis, there was a long clap of thunder, louder than before, and I suddenly saw a fiery ball flying from the window straight towards the head of the Emperor. The ball (it was of lightning) whirled around the floor, then passed the chandelier and flew out through the door into the park. My heart froze, I glanced at my grandfather– his face was completely calm. He crossed himself just as calmly as he had when the fiery ball had flown near us, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was unseemly and not courageous to be frightened as I was. I felt that one had only to look at what was happening and believe in the mercy of God, as he, my grandfather, did. After the ball had passed through the whole church, and suddenly gone out through the door, I again looked at my grandfather. A faint smile was on his face, and he nodded his head at me. My panic disappeared, and from that time I had no more fear of storms." ...|$|E
