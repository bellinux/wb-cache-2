25|$|Ancient Greek, ancient Roman {{and medieval}} {{philosophers}} usually combined the geocentric {{model with a}} spherical Earth. It {{is not the same}} as the older flat Earth model implied in some mythology. The ancient Jewish Babylonian uranography pictured a flat Earth with a dome-shaped, rigid canopy called the <b>firmament</b> placed over it (רקיע- rāqîa'). However, the ancient Greeks believed that the motions of the planets were circular and not elliptical, a view that was not challenged in Western culture until the 17th century through the synthesis of theories by Copernicus and Kepler.|$|E

The anchoring mechanism provides individuals a value or an ideal {{that allows them}} to focus their attentions in a consistent manner.

25|$|The flat Earth {{model is}} an archaic {{conception}} of Earth's shape as a plane or disk. Many ancient cultures subscribed to a flat Earth cosmography, including Greece until the classical period, the Bronze Age and Iron Age civilizations of the Near East until the Hellenistic period, India until the Gupta period (early centuries AD), and China until the 17th century. That paradigm was also typically {{held in the}} aboriginal cultures of the Americas, {{and the notion of}} a flat Earth domed by the <b>firmament</b> in the shape of an inverted bowl was common in pre-scientific societies.|$|E
25|$|This {{legend has}} been {{interpreted}} to be a mythological conflation of a seasonal and astronomical event: The heliacal rising of Sirius (with which Tishtrya is associated) occurred in July, just before the hottest and driest time of the year. For the next few days, Sirius is visible at dawn as a flimmering star (doing battle with Apaosha). In the torrid summer months, as Sirius becomes more directly visible, {{the light of the}} star appears to grow stronger (Tishtrya gathering strength) until it is steadily visible in the <b>firmament</b> (Apaosha vanquished). With the defeat of Apaosha, the rainy season begins (in late autumn).|$|E
25|$|From {{the late}} 1920s {{to the end}} of the 1930s Varèse's {{principal}} creative energies went into two ambitious projects which were never realized, and much of whose material was destroyed, though some elements from them seem to have gone into smaller works. One was a large-scale stage work called by different names at different times, but principally The One-All-Alone or Astronomer (L'Astronome). This was originally to be based on North American Indian legends; later it became a futuristic drama of world catastrophe and instantaneous communication with the star Sirius. This second form, on which Varèse worked in Paris in 1928–1932, had a libretto by Alejo Carpentier, Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes and Robert Desnos. According to Carpentier, a substantial amount of this work was written but Varèse abandoned it in favour of a new treatment in which he hoped to collaborate with Antonin Artaud. Artaud's libretto Il n'y a plus de <b>firmament</b> was written for Varèse's project and sent to him after he had returned to the U.S. but by this time Varèse had turned to a second huge project.|$|E

60|$|But that morning, the two gray <b>firmaments</b> of sky {{and water}} seemed {{collapsed}} into a vague ellipsis. And alike, the Chamois seemed drifting {{in the atmosphere}} as in the sea.

25|$|We {{are entirely}} in accord in admitting the {{existence}} of God. How can I doubt His when I am convinced of mine. Who so recognizes the effect recognizes the cause. To doubt God is to doubt one's own conscience, and in consequence, {{it would be to}} doubt everything; and then what is life for? Now then, my faith in God, if the result of a ratiocination may be called faith, is blind, blind in the sense of knowing nothing. I neither believe nor disbelieve the qualities which many attribute to Him; before theologians' and philosophers' definitions and lucubrations of this ineffable and inscrutable being I find myself smiling. Faced with the conviction of seeing myself confronting the supreme Problem, which confused voices seek to explain to me, I cannot but reply: ‘It could be’; but the God that I foreknow is far more grand, far more good: Plus Supra!...I believe in (revelation); but not in revelation or revelations which each religion or religions claim to possess. Examining them impartially, comparing them and scrutinizing them, one cannot avoid discerning the human 'fingernail' and the stamp of the time in which they were written... No, let us not make God in our image, poor inhabitants that we are of a distant planet lost in infinite space. However, brilliant and sublime our intelligence may be, it is scarcely more than a small spark which shines and in an instant is extinguished, and it alone can give us no idea of that blaze, that conflagration, that ocean of light. I believe in revelation, but in that living revelation which surrounds us on every side, in that voice, mighty, eternal, unceasing, incorruptible, clear, distinct, universal as is the being from whom it proceeds, in that revelation which speaks to us and penetrates us from the moment we are born until we die. What books can better reveal to us the goodness of God, His love, His providence, His eternity, His glory, His wisdom? ‘The heavens declare the glory of God, and the <b>firmament</b> showeth his handiwork.|$|E

500|$|In {{the first}} book he ponders the origin {{and nature of the}} universe, {{considering}} theories by Xenophanes, Hesiod, Leucippus, Heraclitus, Thales, and Empedocles before arguing that the universe was created from the four elements and is governed by a divine spirit. Manilius holds the view that the universe is made up of two spheres: one solid (the Earth) and one hollow (the [...] "sphere of stars", often known as the <b>firmament).</b> The constellations are fixed in the firmament; the Earth is stationary and the <b>firmament</b> revolves around it, accounting for the movement of the stars at night. The planets, the moon, and the Sun revolve around the Earth in the space between its surface and the edge of the <b>firmament.</b> Because the Earth is {{in the center of the}} universe, it is equidistant on all sides from the firmament; thus, it remains in place at the center, as it is not compelled to [...] "fall" [...] in any specific direction. According to Manilius, the universe is ruled by a god (conspirat deus) and governed by reason (ratione gubernat); however, he is vague about the exact relationship between the deity, the universe, and reason. After Manilius finishes describing the universe, he discusses the constellations and stars and the celestial circles. In this section, Manilius places particular emphasis on the Milky Way, and he proposes six explanations for this unique celestial body: it is the place in the sky where either two hemispheres are coming apart or together, it is the former path that the Sun traveled, it is the route Phaethon took when he drove the sun chariot of Helios, it is milk that was spilled from Juno's breast, it is a concentration of small stars, or it is the abode of dead heroes. Manilius agrees with the latter point and finishes his discussion of the Milky Way by considering heroes who have earned a place in the heavens. The first book then concludes with an exploration of cometswhich Manilius sees as harbingers of disasters, such as plagues.|$|E

500|$|In {{line with}} earlier Greek thought, the 4th-century bishop and theologian, Augustine of Hippo, {{wrote that the}} {{creation}} story in the Book of Genesis should not be read too literally.
