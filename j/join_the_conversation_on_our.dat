40|$|Communities-of-practice (CoPs) have {{received}} significant attention within {{a variety of}} literatures but we remain largely ignorant of the potential of purposefully-created CoPs in global organisations. In this context, the challenge {{is likely to be}} convincing ‘masters’ (Wenger, 1998) on <b>the</b> merits of <b>joining</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>on</b> practice at a distance, thus making the willingness for exchange a key to the quality and longevity of the community. We posed the question “Why would busy, dispersed, knowledgeable professionals want to join and participate in a deliberately-organised CoP?” Our 2 -year collaborative action study allowed us to observe the CoP and its membership at close range. We conclude that autonomy, competence and belonging underscore participation, co-production and diffusion of innovative problem-solving and practice beyond the CoP. The study will inform organisations contemplating similar interventions and also serves as a basis for further investigation and theory building on organized CoPs by the research community...|$|R
40|$|The December 2003 {{special issue}} of the Journal of International Management sought to {{initiate}} a dialogue on globalization {{and the role of}} the global corporation (Bird and Stevens, 2003). We attempt to carry that dialogue forward by responding to several objections that were raised by critics in that issue. Their comments prompted us to take a fresh look at our own perspective, as well as to critically examine theirs. In so doing, we find not only persuasive evidence that globalization is very much alive and well, but we also find that caution is warranted if readers wish to avoid misdirected responses that would otherwise obsolesce an emerging substantive discourse on the phenomenon of globalization.

Despite the increase in scholarly publications no {{attempts have been made to}} summarize the publication landscape and to identify works that had great impact to physical {{activity and}} aging research. We conducted a bibliometric analysis and collected publication data from 1980 to February 6, 2015 in the Web of Science Core Collection. Of the overall 9, 935 publications most were published after 2007 and almost 60 % were in the category of Geriatrics and Gerontology or Sport Sciences. Highly cited publications (n = 45) were mostly authored by researchers from US institutions and were quantitative in nature. Publications that reported on the associations or effects of physical activity on health in older adults made up 60 % of the highly cited publications.

The MAP-(k) it contains stickers and background maps that are open and adjustable and it intends to construct a common language among participants. This language – which is new to all participants – aims to create a different dialogue than every participant is used to in her/his own context. MAP-it’s ‘unfamiliar’ character enables everybody to <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>on</b> an equal level. MAPit encourages participants to take the risk to explore the rich potential of their mutual differences and to deal with the resulting uncertainty in a playful and constructive way. A review of risk-related literature shows that this type of risk-taking is often underexposed in the description of participatory methods. Generally, (the descriptions of) these methods – and certainly when used in commercial contexts – focus on reaching consensus between participants as efficient as possible. However, risk is an integral and necessary part of the participatory process. status: publishe...|$|R

Thanks to the digital revolution carried out through such means as super-computational power at super-affordable prices, the Internet, broadband penetration, and contemporary computer science and technology, the global, national, and local public finds itself at the convergence of unprecedented scientific and cultural knowledge and content development, along with unprecedented means to distribute, communicate, and access that knowledge. This Article <b>joins</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Access-to-Knowledge, Access-to- Medicine, and Access-to-Art movements by asserting that the copyright restrictions affecting knowledge, innovation, and original thought implicate copyright’s originality and idea-expression doctrines first and fair use doctrine second. <b>The</b> parallel <b>conversation</b> in copyright law that focuses on the proper definition of the contours of copyright as described in the U.

Supreme Court’s most recent constitutional law cases on copyright—Feist, Eldred, Golan, and Kirtsaeng—interprets the originality and idea-expression doctrines as being necessary for the proper balance between copyright protection and First Amendment freedom of expression. This Article seeks to <b>join</b> together <b>the</b> two <b>conversations</b> by focusing attention on the right to access published works under both copyright and First Amendment law. Access to works {{is part and parcel of}} the copyright contours debate. It is a “first principles” question to be answered before the question of manipulation, appropriation, or fair use is contemplated. The original intent of the Copyright Clause and its need to accommodate the First Amendment freedom of expression support the construction of the contours of copyright to include a right to access knowledge and information. Therefore, the originality and idea-expression doctrines should be reconstructed to recognize that the right to deny access to published works is extremely limited if not non-existent within the properly constructed contours of copyright...|$|R

Can infrastructure development in today’s fast growing economies be compared with the development of infrastructure in the Western world, where many of today’s infrastructure systems evolved over decades and centuries? How have historic visions of society and societal needs in Western societies shaped infrastructure development? Can today’s infrastructure development in Western and other societies be related to similar visions and strategies, or do we see new interpretations of the concept of infrastructure and new infrastructure development models being brought into being? The relevance of these questions is aggravated by the rapid urbanisation worldwide and the increasing stress <b>on</b> 20 <b>Join</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>on</b> Twitter with #isngi 2013 natural resources. Just expanding our legacy infrastructure systems is unlikely to be the best strategy to support the surging urban population in the megalopolises of the future and the dwindling rural population. Today’s planning and design choices will determine whether tomorrow’s infrastructure systems will enable or inhibit a sustainable development of societies across the globe, and to what extent we can ensure livelihoods for all, while safeguarding the livability of cities {{and the quality of the}} natural environment. We will explore how national governments and infrastructure providers navigate the multi-scale and cross-sectoral governance reality of infrastructure systems in response to the challenges of the 21 st century, and how bottom-up initiatives add their own dynamics to the picture. We will reflect on the potential of translating best practices across cultural borders...|$|R

He was quite alive to {{the propriety of}} such attentions, and to their expediency; and Clara was amused as she watched him while he sat by her side, by the hour together, answering little questions and making little remarks suited to the temperament of the old lady's mind. She, herself, was hardly called upon to <b>join</b> in <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>on</b> that evening, and as she sat and listened, she could not but think that Will Belton would have been less adroit, but that he would also have been more straightforward.

Clara could hardly make up her mind whether Captain Aylmer was or was not a sincere man. On the following day Aylmer was out all the morning, paying visits among his constituents, and at three o'clock he was to make his speech in the Town-hall. Special places in the gallery were to be kept for Mrs. Winterfield and her niece, and the old woman was quite resolved that she would be there. As the day advanced she became very fidgety, and at length she was quite alive to the perils of having to climb up the Town-hall stairs; but she persevered, and at ten minutes before three she was seated in her place.|$|R

40|$|Dissertation Abstract "A Tragedy of Success!" {{is a close}} {{engagement}} with the ongoing artistic turn to Haiti and its revolution within the Caribbean literary imaginary. It argues that twentieth and twenty-first writers of the region {{are drawn to the}} nation and its Upheaval precisely because the striking incongruity of Haiti's revolutionary past and postcolonial present vividly discloses how the modern Caribbean experience is profoundly shaped by the ceaseless play of radical change (conquest, colonialism and anti-colonial revolution) and debilitating communal crisis. This project <b>joins</b> <b>the</b> rich <b>conversation</b> <b>on</b> Haiti, modernity and the Revolution begun by C. LR. James, and continued by Nick Nesbitt and Sibylle Fischer, to address this discussion's slight attention to the abundant literary production inspired by the Revolution. This dissertation therefore focuses on the ideological work of the Revolution's repeated narration in the Caribbean, specifically, {{the manner in which it}} arouses anti-colonial aspirations. It argues that the Caribbean experience of modernity has introduced a tragic mode into literary representations of the Upheaval, causing regional writers to depict the immediate as confounded by the past. Characterized by a subtle wavering between tragic pathos and comic elation, iii this mode is as much an {{engagement with}} time and its affective oscillation as it is a politics of possibility. It speaks strongly to the writers' longing for total decolonial liberation region wide. This project participates in the rethinking of tragedy, as initiated by contemporary scholars like Rita Felski, Timothy Reiss and David Scott, in order to gauge how Caribbean writers use Haiti to negotiate the difficulties and successes of the region in their efforts to portray their desire for an improved Caribbean future. i...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} <b>join</b> <b>the</b> {{national}} <b>conversation</b> <b>on</b> race and policing. This conversation {{about race and}} policing should be of concern to everyone because problematic shootings by police cost taxpayers {{millions of dollars in}} settlements arising from civil lawsuits. These monies could instead be going towards improving social services, schools, and jobs. The need for reform of policing practices also transcends race. Almost half of all individuals shot and killed by police each year are White. The paper starts by examining the social science research on race and the decision to shoot. By and large, this research demonstrates that most people are quicker to see a weapon when dealing with a Black suspect than when dealing with a White suspect. Interestingly, several shooter bias studies have found that police officers are better than civilians at deciding when to shoot, suggesting that training and experience can improve accuracy and reduce racial bias in the decision to shoot. Some of the more recent shooter bias studies suggest a counter bias. In these studies, police officers were slower to shoot armed Black suspects over armed White suspects. The contradictory findings of the various shooter bias studies suggest that implicit racial bias may be playing less of a role in police shootings than commonly thought. Indeed, recent research by Phillip Atiba Goff and L. Song Richardson on police officers and stereotype threat suggest that racial bias plays less of a role in police decisions to shoot than whether the officer feels confident in his or her ability to command respect from the subject. Similarly, Frank Rudy Cooper suggests that police officers may be quicker to act punitively against Black suspects than White suspects left because of implicit racial bias and more because they perceive Blacks to pose a greater threat to their masculinity than Whites. In light of the research described above, Professor Lee offers two proposals for reform at the departmental level. First, she proposes that police departments implement training aimed at improving accuracy and reducing bias in the use of deadly force. Fortunately, studies have shown that repeated exposure to Black and White suspects when race is not a diagnostic cue as to whether the suspect is holding a gun results in less biased and more accurate decisions about when to shoot over the long-term. Professor Lee suggests that police departments borrow from these studies but use high-definition shooting simulators rather than computer keyboard exercises to more closely replicate on-the-street experiences. Second, she proposes that police departments mandate ongoing traditional martial arts training for all officers...|$|R
40|$|AFTER THE GREAT RECESSION: LAW AND ECONOMICS’ TOPICS OF INVENTION AND ARRANGEMENT AND TROPES OF STYLE by Michael D. Murray Abstract The Great Recession of 2008 and onward {{has drawn}} {{attention}} to the American economic and financial system, and has cast a critical spotlight on the theories, policies, and assumptions of the modern, neoclassical school of law and economics—often labeled the 2 ̆ 2 Chicago School 2 ̆ 2 —because this school of legal economic thought has had great influence on the American economy and financial system. The Chicago School 2 ̆ 7 s positions on deregulation and the limitation or elimination of oversight and government restraints on stock markets, derivative markets, and other financial practices {{are the result of}} decades of neoclassical economic assumptions regarding the efficiency of unregulated markets, the near-religious-like devotion to a hyper-simplified conception of rationality and self-interest with regard to the persons and institutions participating in the financial system, and a conception of laws and government policies as incentives and costs in a manner that excludes the actual conditions and complications of reality. This Article <b>joins</b> <b>the</b> critical <b>conversation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Great Recession and the role of law and economics in this crisis by examining neoclassical and contemporary law and economics from the perspective of legal rhetoric. Law and economics has developed into a school of contemporary legal rhetoric that provides topics of invention and arrangement and tropes of style to test and improve general legal discourse in areas beyond the economic analysis of law. The rhetorical canons of law and economics—mathematical and scientific methods of analysis and demonstration; the characterization of legal phenomena as incentives and costs; the rhetorical economic concept of efficiency; and rational choice theory as corrected by modern behavioral social sciences, cognitive studies, and brain science—make law and economics a persuasive method of legal analysis and a powerful school of contemporary legal rhetoric, if used in the right hands. My Article is the first to examine the prescriptive implications of the rhetoric of law and economics for general legal discourse as opposed to examining the benefits and limitations of the economic analysis of law itself. This Article advances <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> in two areas: first, as to the study and understanding of the persuasiveness of law and economics, particularly because that persuasiveness has played a role in influencing American economic and financial policy leading up to the Great Recession; and second, as to the study and understanding of the use of economic topics of invention and arrangement and tropes of style in general legal discourse when evaluated in comparison to the other schools of classical and contemporary legal rhetoric. I examine each of the rhetorical canons of law and economics and explain how each can be used to create meaning, inspire imagination, and improve the persuasiveness of legal discourse in every area of law. My conclusion is that the rhetorical canons of law and economics can be used to create meaning and inspire imagination in legal discourse beyond the economic analysis of law, but the canons are tools that only are as good as the user, and can be corrupted in ways that helped to bring about the current economic crisis...|$|R
40|$|THE GREAT RECESSION AND THE RHETORICAL CANONS OF LAW AND ECONOMICS, by Michael D. Murray Abstract The Great Recession of 2008 and onward {{has drawn}} {{attention}} to the American economic and financial system, and has cast a critical spotlight on the theories, policies, and assumptions of the modern, neoclassical school of law and economics—often labeled the 2 ̆ 2 Chicago School 2 ̆ 2 —because this school of legal economic thought has had great influence on the American economy and financial system.

This Article <b>joins</b> <b>the</b> critical <b>conversation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Great Recession and the role of law and economics in this crisis by examining neoclassical and contemporary law and economics from the perspective of legal rhetoric. The Great Recession already has caused several of the stars of the Chicago School to recant their hardest, most definite statements concerning market efficiency and the necessity of non-regulation and zero government oversight (or interference) in the financial system. The law and economics movement is likely to regroup or reform itself under a revised conception of market efficiency, as indicated by the chastened admissions {{of the leaders of the}} old school, or move in the direction of a revised conception of rational choice theory represented by the thriving school of behavioral law and economics. In order to better understand the law and economics movement now and in the future, this Article <b>joins</b> <b>the</b> discussion by pointing out the fundamental rhetorical canons of law and economics. These canons have made law and economics a persuasive form of discourse: 	Mathematical and scientific methods of analysis and demonstration; 	The characterization of legal phenomena as incentives and costs; 	The rhetorical economic concept of efficiency; and 	Rational choice theory as corrected by modern behavioral social sciences, cognitive studies, and brain science. Law and economics has developed into a school of contemporary legal rhetoric with a particular, effective combination of topics of invention and arrangement and tropes of style that are relevant to legal rhetoric beyond the economic analysis of law. My Article is the first to examine the prescriptive implications of the rhetoric of law and economics for general legal discourse as opposed to examining the benefits and limitations of the economic analysis of law itself.
