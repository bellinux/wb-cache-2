5|$|At {{the outset}} of the war, Australia's economy had been quite small and {{dependent}} largely upon agriculture and the resources industries for export earnings, while most manufactured products were imported <b>from</b> <b>overseas.</b> Almost immediately uncertainty over the continuation of foreign trade led to a rise in unemployment, indeed it was estimated that after only a couple of days of Britain having declared war, that up to 15,000 men had been retrenched in New South Wales alone due to concerns about the continued availability of foreign markets for Australian produce.|$|E

5|$|Fishing {{and tourism}} {{now account for}} much of the area's economy.

A large number of cribs (holiday cottages) occur at places such as Jack's Bay and Pounawea. Ecotourism is becoming increasingly important to the area's economy, with many of the visitors coming <b>from</b> <b>overseas.</b> Tourism added an estimated $2.4 million to the region's economy in 2003.|$|E

5|$|Massenet {{composed}} {{many other}} smaller-scale choral works, {{and more than}} two hundred songs. His early collections of songs were particularly popular and helped establish his reputation. His choice of lyrics ranged widely. Most were verses by poets such as Musset, Maupassant, Hugo, Gautier and many lesser-known French writers, with occasional poems <b>from</b> <b>overseas,</b> including Tennyson in English and Shelley in French translation. Grove comments that Massenet's songs, though pleasing and impeccable in craftsmanship, are less inventive than those of Bizet and less distinctive than those of Duparc and Fauré.|$|E
5|$|No {{records of}} the Maine Coon's exact origins and date of {{introduction}} to the United States exist, so several competing hypotheses have been suggested.

The Maine Coon has since made a comeback and {{is now one of}} the more popular cat breeds in the world.|$|E
