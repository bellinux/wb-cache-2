5|$|In {{addition}} to the pressurised modules, Mir featured several external components. The largest component was the Sofora <b>girder,</b> a large scaffolding-like structure consisting of 20 segments which, when assembled, projected 14 metres from its mount on Kvant-1. A self-contained thruster block, the VDU, was mounted {{on the end of}} Sofora and was used to augment the roll-control thrusters on the core module. The VDU's increased distance from Mirs axis allowed an 85% decrease in fuel consumption, reducing the amount of propellant required to orient the station. A second <b>girder,</b> Rapana, was mounted aft of Sofora on Kvant-1. This <b>girder,</b> a small prototype of a structure intended to be used on Mir-2 to hold large parabolic dishes away from the main station structure, was 5 metres long and used as a mounting point for externally mounted exposure experiments.|$|E

On the cable-stayed section, the bridge is marked with navigation lights, {{as well as the}} center of the sailing area having a racon. The bridge is the second-longest bridge in Norway, behind the Drammen Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Many bridge {{designs were}} used for roads over the highway, {{including}} the concrete arch bridge, the through plate <b>girder</b> bridge and the concrete T-beam bridge. Bridges used to carry the turnpike over other roads and streams included a concrete arch viaduct in New Stanton. At , the New Stanton viaduct was the longest bridge along the original section of the turnpike. Other turnpike bridges included plate <b>girder</b> bridges like the bridge over Dunnings Creek in the Bedford Narrows. Smaller concrete T-beam bridges were also built; a total of 307 bridges were constructed along the original section of the turnpike.|$|E

40|$|Precast, {{prestressed}} <b>girders</b> {{are used}} {{across the state}} of Alabama for bridge construction. There has been a desire to allow self-consolidating concrete {{to be used to}} manufacture these bridge <b>girders.</b> The time-dependent deformation response of bridge <b>girders</b> that contain self-consolidating concrete is important information that must be gathered before the use of self-consolidating concrete in bridge <b>girders</b> can be widely used in the state of Alabama. Twenty-eight bulb-tee <b>girders</b> were measured for internal strain and camber.

5|$|Like the Philadelphia {{extension}}, {{the western}} extension required {{the building of}} long bridges, including those that cross the Beaver River and the Allegheny River. The overpasses along the road consisted of steel <b>girder</b> bridges and through plate <b>girder</b> bridges. Unlike the other segments, the concrete arch bridge was not used for overpasses, although {{it was used to}} carry the turnpike over other roads. On August 7, 1950, the roadway opened between the Irwin and Pittsburgh interchanges. Ohio Governor Frank Lausche led a dedication ceremony on November 26, 1951. The extension opened to the Gateway toll plaza near the Ohio border on December 26, 1951. At the time, the highway ended in a cornfield. Traffic followed a temporary ramp onto local rural roads until the connecting Ohio Turnpike could be built. On December 1, 1954, the Ohio Turnpike opened.|$|E
5|$|MD32 was reconstructed and widened from Sykesville to Eldersburg {{starting}} in 1957 and from West Friendship to {{just south of}} Sykesville in 1958. The state highway's bypass of Sykesville was completed in 1963; the old road {{through the center of}} Sykesville became MD851. MD32's new bridge across the Patapsco River was the longest of only three aluminum triangular box beam <b>girder</b> bridges constructed in the United States. The <b>girder</b> system was topped by a concrete slab deck and underlain with standard concrete abutments and piers and steel bearing pads on which the aluminum girders rested. These bridges, which were designed by Fairchild Engine and Airplane Company, were constructed of aluminum due to that metal's light weight but similar strength compared to steel. Many experimental aluminum bridges were built due to a severe shortage of steel in the early 1960s. Aluminum bridges are rarely constructed because they are much more expensive than steel and concrete bridges.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the cost-effectiveness of steel <b>girders</b> compared with conventional reinforced concrete <b>girders</b> used in bridge construction in South Africa. The investigation considered an existing bridge which required widening {{as a result of}} increased traffic flow. The consulting engineers chose two 10 m reinforced concrete <b>girders</b> for the end spans, while two 22 m post-tensioned reinforced concrete <b>girders</b> were used for the central spans. To determine the cost-effectiveness of the consulting engineerâ€™s choice, steel <b>girders</b> were designed for the 10 m and 22 m beams based on the relevant South African design codes of practice. The analysis was conducted for both non-composite and composite action between the steel <b>girders</b> and the reinforced concrete bridge deck. Based on the design calculations, a cost comparison was performed. The investigation revealed that steel <b>girders</b> are an economically viable option when off-the-shelf steel sections up to 10 m in length are considered. For the 10 m <b>girders,</b> a significant cost saving was achieved for both non-composite and composite construction compared with reinforced concrete. However, for the 22 m spans, the post-tensioned reinforced concrete <b>girders</b> are significantly more cost-effective compared with steel plate <b>girders.</b> Thus, bridge design engineers should consider steel <b>girders</b> as an option during the conceptual design stage for end spans. A survey was also conducted among senior engineering professionals to determine the reason(s) for the apathy towards using structural steel sections as <b>girders</b> in bridge construction in South Africa...|$|R

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of elastic moment for built-up crane runway <b>girders</b> {{is not an}} easy task as the difficulty involves the calculation of torsional properties including warping constant, the coefficient of monosymmetry, and torsion constant.

40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} on continuous plate <b>girders</b> {{have been}} performed. The parameter that was deliberately varied in two {{series of the}} tests was the width - to - thickness ratio of the web (b_w/t_w) and of the flange (b_f/t_f). The <b>girders</b> of the second series were doubly long than the <b>girders</b> of the first series. The tests have shown, that in case of the <b>girders</b> with shear collapse mechanism, {{the continuity of the}} <b>girders</b> desapears gradually together with the load increasing. The ratio of the reactions at the intermediate and end support (R_m/R_e) from the tests was for all short <b>girders</b> smaller than according to beam theory (considering shear deformations). The investigations suggest that the distribution of the reactions could be assumed from the 'truss model'. From the comparison of the test results with the theoretical calculation according to DASt-Ri 015 {{it can be seen that}} the degree of underestimation is up to 30 per cent for the <b>girders</b> with shear collaps mechanism.

In order to obtain the moment-rotation relationship for the steel <b>girders</b> at the internal supports, fifteen double-symmetric, welded, I-shaped steel <b>girders</b> were tested. Steel with a nominal yield strength of 700 MPa and 220 MPa was used. The 220 MPa steel {{was used in the}} web of two of the tested <b>girders</b> (hybrid <b>girders),</b> while flanges were made of 700 MPa. Flange and web slenderness ratios as well as the length of the <b>girders</b> were varied in the tests.
