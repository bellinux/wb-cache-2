5|$|When Otho was {{defeated}} by Vitellius at the First Battle of Bedriacum, the armies in Judaea and Egypt took matters <b>into</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands</b> and declared Vespasian emperor on 1 July 69. Vespasian accepted and entered an alliance with Gaius Licinius Mucianus, the governor of Syria, against Vitellius. A strong force drawn from the Judaean and Syrian legions marched on Rome {{under the command of}} Mucianus, while Vespasian travelled to Alexandria, leaving Titus in charge of ending the Jewish rebellion.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{continued}} defacement, fans rushed to the sites of the installments as soon as they are announced. A group of men took advantage of this and threatened to deface a stencil painting of a beaver in East New York, charging money for people to take photographs. Some took matters <b>into</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands</b> by guarding the works, others restoring them once defaced. In part because of the defacement, but also because of the great value of the artworks, property owners have also gone to extreme measures to protect the art. Some hired security guards, others covered the art with acrylic glass, and yet others installed metal roll-down gates.|$|E
5|$|The {{events that}} would cost Cumanus his office began {{with the murder of}} one or more Galilean pilgrims who had been {{travelling}} through Samaria on their way to Jerusalem. A Galilean embassy asked Cumanus to investigate but received little attention; Josephus alleges that he had been bribed by the Samaritans to turn a blind eye. The result was that a crowd of Jews decided to take the law <b>into</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands.</b> Under the leadership of two Zealots, Eleazar and Alexander, they invaded Samaria and began a massacre. Cumanus led most of his troops against the militants, killing many and taking others prisoner, and the Jewish leaders from Jerusalem were subsequently able to calm most of the others, but a state of guerrilla warfare persisted.|$|E

50|$|Born {{just before}} the end of the Han Dynasty, the Ruan family fortune rose with the rise of Cao Cao and the rest of the Cao family. However, while Ji was still quite young, the fortune of the Ruan family became imperiled with the rise of the Sima family: {{originally}} the Sima had merely served as officials under the Cao; but, as time went by they managed to accrue more and more power <b>into</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> family's <b>hands,</b> particularly beginning with Sima Yi this process of growth of power would eventually culminate in the founding of the Jin Dynasty (265-420) by Sima Yan. Furthermore, during the time of Ruan Ji, there was ongoing peril from the ongoing military struggles with the kingdom of Shu Han, together with other impending military and political changes.|$|R
5|$|With the Observer Corps {{passing a}} steady stream of reports {{regarding}} approaching German formations they soon realised a coordinated attack was under way. The two Squadrons approaching the high-altitude attack could not be diverted and no fighters had been asked to engage the 9 Staffel. The only Squadron {{on the ground in the}} area was No. 111 Squadron RAF that had 12 Hurricanes at RAF Croydon. Although usually the responsibility of Park, the controllers took the matter <b>into</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands</b> and ordered all aircraft into the air. Even those that were not in combat condition were flown north-east, to avoid them being caught on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only was}} there little social stigma {{attached}} to smuggling in the colonies, but in port cities, where trade was the primary generator of wealth, smuggling enjoyed considerable community support, and it was even possible to obtain insurance against being caught. Colonial merchants developed an impressive repertoire of evasive maneuvers to conceal the origin, nationality, routes and content of their illicit cargoes. This included the frequent use of fraudulent paperwork to make the cargo appear legal and authorised. And much to the frustration of the British authorities, when seizures did happen local merchants were often able to use sympathetic provincial courts to reclaim confiscated goods and have their cases dismissed. For instance, Edward Randolph, the appointed head of customs in New England brought 36 seizures to trial from 1680 {{to the end of}} 1682 – and all but two of these were acquitted. Alternatively merchants sometimes took matters <b>into</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands</b> and stole illicit goods back while impounded.|$|E
5|$|Otho and Vitellius {{realised}} {{the potential}} {{threat posed by}} the Flavian faction. With four legions at his disposal, Vespasian commanded a strength of nearly 80,000 soldiers. His position in Judaea further granted him {{the advantage of being}} nearest to the vital province of Egypt, which controlled the grain supply to Rome. His brother Titus Flavius Sabinus II, as city prefect, commanded the entire city garrison of Rome. Tensions among the Flavian troops ran high, but as long as Galba and Otho remained in power, Vespasian refused to take action. When Otho was defeated by Vitellius at the First Battle of Bedriacum however, the armies in Judaea and Egypt took matters <b>into</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands</b> and declared Vespasian emperor on 1 July 69. Vespasian accepted, and entered an alliance with Gaius Licinius Mucianus, the governor of Syria, against Vitellius. A strong force drawn from the Judaean and Syrian legions marched on Rome under the command of Mucianus, while Vespasian himself travelled to Alexandria, leaving Titus in charge of ending the Jewish rebellion.|$|E
6000|$|The reader {{has perhaps}} read that {{remarkable}} work, [...] "Who Put Back the Clock?" [...] by E. H. B., which appeared {{for several days}} upon the railway bookstalls and then vanished entirely {{from the face of}} the earth. Whether eating Time makes the chief of his diet out of old editions; whether Providence has passed a special enactment on behalf of authors; or whether these last have taken the law <b>into</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>hand,</b> bound themselves <b>into</b> a dark conspiracy with a password, which I would die rather than reveal, and night after night sally forth under some vigorous leader, such as Mr. James Payn or Mr. Walter Besant, on their task of secret spoliation--certain it is, at least, that the old editions pass, giving place to new. To the proof, it is believed there are now only three copies extant of [...] "Who Put Back the Clock?" [...] one in the British Museum, successfully concealed by a wrong entry in the catalogue; another in one of the cellars (the cellar where the music accumulates) of the Advocates' Library at Edinburgh; and a third, bound in morocco, in the possession of Gideon Forsyth. To account for the very different fate attending this third exemplar, the readiest theory is to suppose that Gideon admired the tale. How to explain that admiration might appear (to those who have perused the work) more difficult; but the weakness of a parent is extreme, and Gideon (and not his uncle, whose initials he had humorously borrowed) was the author of [...] "Who Put Back the Clock?" [...] He had never acknowledged it, or only to some intimate friends while it was still in proof; after its appearance and alarming failure, the modesty of the novelist had become more pressing, and the secret was now likely to be better kept than that of the authorship of [...] "Waverley." ...|$|R
5000|$|Fake hand announcement: Here, {{an angle}} shooter {{attempts}} to bluff {{at the end}} of a play by announcing his hand as a something stronger than it actually is in an attempt to prompt <b>their</b> opponent <b>into</b> reflexively mucking <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>hand</b> in disgust. The angle shooter then claims the pot, claiming, if he is required to reveal, that he made an honest error in announcing his hand. Similarly, angle shooters might hold on to a losing hand, hoping the winning hand will be mucked at showdown due to player or dealer error, and then claim the pot. A simple way to avoid being taken advantage of by angle shooting at poker is always protect one's hand and always let the [...] "cards speak"; that is, turning over one's hand at the showdown for all to see, in other words, be attentive at all stages of the game.|$|R
40|$|The Day of Silence {{is a day}} {{of silent}} protest for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender equal rights and {{treatment}} in schools. It has been in action annually since 1996 when students at the University of West Virginia decided to take action <b>into</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> creative <b>hands.</b> Now, 450, 000 students from kindergarten to college spend their day in silence together. This hardly makes holding this program at the University of Rhode Island an original concept. However, for a school who has never observed such a day before and a school {{with a lack of}} GLBT involvement, this day could be monumental. As a campus with over 100 student clubs and organizations, this day {{has the potential to be}} huge. With so many students already actively involved, especially in the social rights sphere, holding a Day of Silence at URI could be the perfect tool for creating change for GLBT rights in our community and beyond. If you are a gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender student at any age, odds are that you live your life in a certain degree of silence and oppression. Though comfort levels of identity expression span a wide variety of manifestations, statistics do not lie. The Gay, Lesbian, Straight Education Network (GLSEN) conducted a National School Climate Survey in 2003 which found some astonishing results. The report showed that 4 out of 5 GLBT students reported verbal, sexual, or physical harassment at school and more than 30...|$|R
5|$|Rhonda Latimer, {{an aging}} {{reporter}} for Fox News Channel who is idolized by viewers {{because of her}} good looks, is dismissed when the network's first high-definition broadcast exposes her wrinkles, leaving a job opportunity open. Lois auditions for the part, ignoring Brian's warnings that Fox News is a heavily biased network, and she is chosen as the new reporter. On her first day reporting, she is assigned to do an exposé on Michael Moore {{to prove that he}} is a homosexual. When she spies on him outside his house, she sees Rush Limbaugh coming out, leading her to conclude that Limbaugh and Moore are in a gay relationship. However, Fox News refuses to allow any material against fellow conservative Limbaugh to be broadcast, leading Lois to realize that Brian was right about them. The two decide to take the story <b>into</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands</b> and confront who they expect to be Moore and a naked Limbaugh in the same bedroom, only to discover that the both of them are portrayed by Fred Savage, who has created bodysuits of them in order to continue his acting career. A flabbergasted Lois ultimately decides to report his story instead.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{go looking}} for Pollidori Sr. and find a shallow grave and {{photographs}} of the dead man with Mutato. Meanwhile, Dr. Pollidori leads an angry mob of townspeople to his father's house, demanding that Mulder and Scully turn the alleged murderer over to them. The agents find Mutato hiding in the basement as the crowd gathers upstairs. Someone accidentally sets the barn alight and in the ensuing confusion, the mob realize that the agents are protecting the monster in the basement. Mutato speaks to the crowd and explains that he was created 25years before, {{and that he is}} the result of a genetic experiment by Dr. Pollidori. Unbeknownst to his son, Pollidori Sr. rescued Mutato and cared for him, but was unable to provide a friend or a mate for the boy. The old man attempted to emulate his scientist son's experiments, and tried to create hybrids from his farm animals. Mutato asks Dr. Pollidori to create a female companion for him, but the scientist says that he cannot—that Mutato was a mistake. The townspeople realize that The Great Mutato is not a monster after all and Dr. Pollidori is arrested for the murder of his father. Mulder feels that it is unjust for Mutato not to get a mate and so he demands to see the writer: Izzy. In a fanciful, if not imagined, scene, Mulder and Scully take matters <b>into</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands</b> and take Mutato, along with the townspeople, to a Cher concert. The episode ends with a shot of Mulder and Scully dancing, which slowly turns back into the comic book seen at the beginning of the episode.|$|E
5|$|Someone paints butts on Pam Halpert's (Jenna Fischer) {{warehouse}} mural. Distraught, she {{demands to}} know the vandal's identity, but the warehouse workers remain silent to protect their coworker. She then tries appealing to the sympathies of the other office workers, but with her husband Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) off in Philadelphia, only Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) show any interest. The three lure warehouse worker Nate (Mark Proksch) upstairs and interrogate him in isolation; Nate soon cracks and identifies Frank (Brad William Henke) as the vandal. They take the matter to human resources, and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) holds a meeting between the involved parties. Pam, presumably at Toby's suggestion, apologizes for having possibly infringed on Frank's space by using the warehouse to paint her mural, but Frank in response insults Pam and her mural using vulgar language and insists that his drawing of butts was funny. Toby and Nelly both take Frank's side, so Pam and Dwight take things <b>into</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands</b> by painting a grotesque nude man on Frank's truck with washable paint. As Pam tells the documentary crew that she feels it is appropriate that she used her art to enact her revenge for the vandalism, Frank shows up yelling in anger and lunges at Pam. Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos), the crew's boom mic operator, intervenes by hitting Frank across the face with his mic. Frank and Brian are subsequently fired by their respective employers. As Brian leaves, he tells Pam that he {{will always be there}} for her if she needs someone.|$|E
