5|$|Exclusive Jurisdiction is {{a concept}} whereby only one Grand Lodge will be {{recognised}} in any geographical area. If two Grand Lodges claim jurisdiction over the same area, the other Grand Lodges will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>between</b> them, {{and they may not}} all decide to recognise the same one. (In 1849, for example, the Grand Lodge of New York split into two rival factions, each claiming to be the legitimate Grand Lodge. Other Grand Lodges had to choose between them until the schism was healed.) Exclusive Jurisdiction can be waived when the two over-lapping Grand Lodges are themselves in Amity and agree to share jurisdiction (for example, since the Grand Lodge of Connecticut is in Amity with the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Connecticut, the principle of Exclusive Jurisdiction does not apply, and other Grand Lodges may recognise both).|$|E

English maps rarely show the French names outside of Quebec, which itself is spelled Québec in French.|$|E

500|$|Roddenberry {{was given}} {{complete}} creative {{control over the}} new television project by Paramount, which had promised him {{that it would be}} able to make the project a [...] "first-class effort" [...] with the budget to suit. Matt Jefferies, who had worked on The Original Series, was recruited as a technical advisor. He had designed the original USS Enterprise alongside Pato Guzman, but was unwilling to give up a position on the television series Little House on the Prairie for a 13-episode order on a new Star Trek series. Roddenberry was adamant that Jefferies was the right person to update the Enterprise, and agreed a position that the designer could advise the new show, but would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>between</b> it and his main duties on Little House on the Prairie if the Star Trek work started to interfere. This occurred quite quickly, after Jefferies conducted design work on the new version of the Enterprise at a hotel in Tucson, Arizona while on a location shoot for Little House on the Prairie, and could not attend meetings with Roddenberry and the producers in Los Angeles. He recommended Joseph R. Jennings as the main art director on the series; Jennings had worked to Jefferies during the [...] and [...] seasons of The Original Series. Jefferies' re-design of the Enterprise was based on the principle that the technology was updated over time, but the general hull remained the same. He highlighted that the engines would specifically be designed to be replaced, so the external design of them was changed. Don Loos of Brick Price Movie Miniatures was hired to produce the physical model of the vessel, which was cast in moulds from fiberglass. Two models were built, a [...] version and a [...] version.|$|E
