25|$|The renal corpuscles and renal tubules, in contrast, are {{developed}} from the metanephrogenic blastema instead of from the ureteric bud. The metanephrogenic blastema is moulded over the growing end of the latter, and becomes {{a part of the}} metanephros in this way. The renal tubules of the metanephros, unlike those of the pronephros and mesonephros, do not open into the Wolffian duct. Instead, the tubules rapidly elongate to form the parts of the nephron: the proximal tubules, the loops of Henle and the distal convoluted tubules. These last join and establish communications with the collecting <b>duct</b> <b>system</b> derived from the ultimate ramifications of the ureteric bud. In the other end, the renal tubules give rise to Bowman's capsules and glomeruli.|$|E
25|$|The {{rudiments of}} the {{permanent}} kidneys make their appearance {{about the end of}} the first or the beginning of the second month. Each kidney originates as a ureteric bud from the caudal end of the Wolffian duct, which, in turn, originates from intermediate mesoderm. The ureteric bud starts close to where the Wolffian duct opens into the cloaca, and grows dorsalward and rostralward along the posterior abdominal wall, where its blind extremity expands and subsequently divides into several buds, which form the rudiments of the renal pelvis and renal calyces; by continued growth and subdivision it gives rise to the collecting <b>duct</b> <b>system</b> of the kidney. The other, more superficial, portion of the diverticulum, on the other hand, becomes the ureter.|$|E

The C60 used a carbon fibre and aluminium honeycomb monocoque chassis, whilst its suspension consisted of double wishbones, pushrods and horizontally-located dynamic dampers. SMG Compétition were the first team to run the car, and their C60 was fitted with a 4-litre naturally-aspirated Judd GV4 V10 engine, In 2001, Pescarolo Sport began using the C60 and their C60s used a Sodemo-developed 3.2-litre twin-turbocharged Peugeot A32 V6 engine, capable of a claimed power output of [...] In 2002, André de Cortanze redeveloped the C60 into the C60 Evo, which notably featured an unusual brake <b>duct</b> <b>system</b> similar to that found on an open-wheel racing car {{at the front of the}} car, whilst the rear wing endplates were redesigned and the Peugeot A32 engine now produced a claimed output of [...] The endplates were further developed in 2003, whilst the engine's air restrictors were decreased in size from , resulting in the claimed power output decreasing to [...] In 2004, Pescarolo began running the car as a [...] "Pescarolo C60" [...] with a 5-litre Judd GV5 V10 engine, as Henri Pescarolo had further developed the C60.

40|$|This paper briefly reviews {{prediction}} {{techniques for}} determination of leakage and friction along auxiliary ventilation <b>ducting</b> <b>systems.</b> In order to compare various prediction techniques {{that have been}} developed over the past, a macroscopic investigation of air leakage and friction resistance of auxiliary ventilation <b>ducting</b> <b>systems</b> has been undertaken. Measurements were conducted on 450 and 915 mm diameter fabric ducting over 100 m duct length to determine frictional resistances and the extent of leakage. Due to the high degree of accuracy required and the large volume of data that needed to be collected, electronic pressure transducers were used with computer for data recording. Conceptual models that describe the leakage characteristics of auxiliary ventilation <b>ducting</b> <b>systems</b> were developed based on this information. It was found that these models provided good correlation with most of the existing prediction techniques. The experimental methodology relying on computer data acquisition has allowed the accuracy of measured values to be treated {{with a high degree of}} confidence.

2500|$|As {{originally}} {{specified by}} Kelsey and Saville, the XP-39 had a turbo-supercharger to augment its high-altitude performance. Bell cooled the turbo with a scoop {{on the left}} side of the fuselage. Kelsey wished to shepherd the XP-39 through its early engineering teething troubles, but he was ordered to England. The XP-39 project was handed over to others, and in June 1939 the prototype was ordered by General Henry H. Arnold to be evaluated in NACA wind tunnels to find ways of increasing its speed, by reducing parasitic drag. Tests were carried out, and Bell engineers followed the recommendations of NACA and the Army to reduce drag such that the top speed was increased 16%. NACA wrote, [...] "it is imperative to enclose the supercharger within the airplane with an efficient <b>duct</b> <b>system</b> for cooling the rotor and discharging the cooling air and exhaust gases." [...] In the very tightly planned XP-39, though, there was no internal space left over for the turbo. Using a drag-buildup scheme, a number of potential areas of drag reduction were found. NACA concluded that a top speed of 429mph could be realized with the aerodynamic improvements they had developed and an uprated V-1710 with only a single-stage, single-speed supercharger.|$|E
