40|$|The {{principal}} {{thesis of}} this Article is that property and contract questions {{should not be}} solved independently and are most usefully approached in a distinct order.

In addition, it is important to first answer some remedial questions before proceeding to make decisions about the property interest of each party to the contract. To support this thesis, this Article explains in detail how the Ashford legacy has affected the treatment of real estate contracts in Washington. It then compares the Washington approach with the doctrine of equitable conversion. Finally, it suggests an analysis for real estate contract problems and applies that analysis to some remaining problem areas...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{the right}} to exclude has {{dominated}} property theory, relegating alienability - another <b>of</b> the standard <b>incidents</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> - to the scholarly shadows. Law and economics has also long neglected inalienability, despite its inclusion in Calabresi and Melamed 2 ̆ 7 s Cathedral. In this Article, I explore inalienability rules as tools for achieving efficiency or other ends when applied to resources that society generally views as appropriate objects of market transactions. Specifically, I focus on inalienability 2 ̆ 7 s capacity to alter upstream decisions by would-be resellers about whether to acquire an entitlement in the first place. By influencing these acquisition decisions, inalienability rules can buttress or substitute for other adjustments to the property bundle in addressing resource dilemmas. Of particular interest {{is the possibility that}} limits on alienability could sidestep the holdout problems that have often spurred resort to liability rules, and could do so without interfering as profoundly with the owner 2 ̆ 7 s autonomy interests. While alienability limits carry well-known disadvantages, they might be structured in ways that would minimize those drawbacks. Recognizing the full potential of alienability limits in addressing resource dilemmas requires applying the same level of creativity to devising inalienability rules as has previously been applied to the design of liability rules...|$|R
40|$|PhDPrior to 1986, Malaysia had {{a system}} whereby patents issued in the United Kingdom could be {{registered}} in Malaysia. On registration, the patent owner would have privileges and rights as those conferred by {{the issue of}} the patent in the United Kingdom. The Patents Act 1983 introduces a completely new code for patent protection in Malaysia. This thesis analyses and evaluates the current provisions relating to the various <b>incidents</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> patent and utility model rights in Malaysia with the aim of assisting in the proper construction of the relevant provisions. The issues of entitlement, the rights of co-owners, the exercise and scope of rights as well as the limitations to and loss of these rights are examined. The main objective {{of this study is to}} seek to achieve a proper balance between the rights of a patent owner and the public. Where necessary, proposals for reforms are made to amend various aspects of the Act with the aim of achieving this objective, ensuring at the same time that the relevant provisions are in conformity with Malaysia's obligations under the Paris Convention and the GAIT-TRIPS Agreement. Since there is a dearth of legal writing and judicial guidance on the relevant provisions of the Act, the approach adopted in the thesis is based on a comparative study of equivalent provisions of patent statutes in various Commonwealth countries and the United States, with special emphasis on United Kingdom law. Common law doctrines are also examined to determine their applicability in the Malaysian context. Where of assistance, the laws of other jurisdictions are examined. The experience of the working of the patent system in these countries is drawn upon in the search for a proper and viable balance between the rights of the competing groups...|$|R
40|$|The {{shareholders}} {{in general}} meeting and {{board of directors}} are the main governing organs of a company. Control of the general meeting theoretically ensures control of {{the composition of the}} board of directors who are usually empowered by the articles to manage the day-to-day administration of the company. The company acts by shareholders and directors voting and passing resolutions in general meeting and board meetings respectively. Controlling sufficient votes to pass resolutions in general and board meetings is therefore the essence of corporate control.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This paper {{analyses}} De Soto's {{argument that}} the formalisation of property leads to economic development and accepts it {{on the premise that}} such formalisation is not a panacea but a possible weapon in the armoury against poverty in South Africa. A prerequisite to formalisation is land acquisition. However, the skewed land ownership statistic in South Africa necessitates a slow and cumbersome restitution process often impeded by excessive compensatory claims by land owners and exacerbated by the interpretation of section 25 of the Constitution by our Constitutional Court. An analysis of recent Constitutional Court decisions indicates that the court is developing a jurisprudence that takes into account the extreme nature and extent of past land dispossessions and the inequalities in wealth and land distribution. This approach could facilitate the expropriation and restitution of land as a deprivation, (in terms of section 25) which is found not to be arbitrary, is not an expropriation and in consequence would not require compensation. Formalisation can then follow. The paper argues further that formalisation in the strict De Sotan sense of western exclusivity <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> is not suited to the South African situation. The 'bundle of sticks' approach to ownership on the other hand, allows formalisation to occur whilst taking cognisance of local realities. Thus, formalisation of tribal trust land could mean common ownership where the 'sticks' of exclusivity and alienation are excluded from the 'bundle' while other 'sticks', inter alia income, security, and right to manage are retained. In the urban context, it is mooted that formalisation could include all the 'sticks' (<b>incidents</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership)</b> but may need to exclude the right to alienate (for a period) to combat the problem of reverse titling. The Richtersveld formalisation model is examined as a case study since it includes both the rural and urban contexts in one formalisation model. It is within this case study that a further 'stick' in the 'bundle' is identified, viz. capacity building and training, as it is seen to be essential that the affected community understands the formalisation model applied. This paper concludes that formalisation as postulated by De Soto could serve as a catalyst for poverty eradication if it takes proper account of South African realities, and on the understanding that formalisation should reflect 'sticks' in the 'bundle' which maximise a community's ownership whilst mitigating anticipated problems...|$|R

40|$|The {{regulatory}} takings doctrine, the Supreme Court {{declared in}} Lingle v. Chevron, concerns {{the effects of}} a regulation on the <b>incidents</b> <b>of</b> property <b>ownership.</b> It serves as a constitutional protection against regulations that impose the functional equivalent to a classic taking of private property (an appropriation by the state or an ouster), and it requires compensation for owners who are subject to such regulations. Just as significant as declaring what the regulatory takings doctrine is, theCourt in Lingle also declared what it is not: it is not a judicial check onthe validity or reasonableness of a regulation that effects a taking. While the Takings Clause serves to correct an unfair outcome due to government regulation, it does not authorize substantive judicial review of government 2 ̆ 7 s discretionary decision to regulate. The exactions decisions in Nollan v. California Coastal Commission and Dolan v. City of Tigard sit uneasily alongside the Court 2 ̆ 7 s recent effort in Lingle to make sense of its long, confusing line of takings decisions. Nollan and Dolan look to the particular effect that a condition will have on a property owner, and in that regard are consistent with the Court 2 ̆ 7 s takings jurisprudence. On the other hand, Nollan and Dolan allow courts to consider the validity {{of the relationship between the}} condition and the government 2 ̆ 7 s stated regulatory purpose. They therefore mandate judicial review of a local government 2 ̆ 7 s substantive regulatory practice, as well as of the justification that local officials use to explain the regulation.

30|$|The {{dissociation}} {{of sense}} of agency and sense <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> is for sure, but how these two senses {{interact with each other}} is not clear enough. Data from behavioral experiments support the additive model, which indicates that sense of agency seems to promote the integration of the sense <b>of</b> <b>ownership,</b> pure sense <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> is fragmentary, and sense of agency can integrate different body parts into a continuum and form a unified body awareness (Tsakiris, Prabhu, & Haggard, 2006; Synofzik et al, 2008; Stein, 1964). However, brain imaging experiments are more supportive of the independent model, according to which sense of agency and sense <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> are essentially different experiences, triggered by different inputs, and using different brain networks, there is no direct overlap (Tsakiris, Longo, & Haggard, 2010). From our point of view, such inconsistency may lie in the experimental design. Since we usually experience sense of agency with sense <b>of</b> <b>ownership,</b> the role <b>of</b> these two types of experiences may not be separated in normal behavioral experiments. Through our research, we can find that when sense of agency and sense <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> were properly separated, the results obtained are consistent with the hypothesis proposed by the independent model. However, our findings do not support claims that sense of agency and sense <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> have no interactions.
