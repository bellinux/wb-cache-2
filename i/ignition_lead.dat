40|$|The Lunar Cargo Transportation and Landing by Soft Touchdown (Lunar CATALYST) {{program is}} {{establishing}} multiple no-funds-exchanged Space Act Agreement (SAA) partnerships with U. S. private sector entities. The {{purpose of this}} program is to encourage the development of robotic lunar landers that can be integrated with U. S. commercial launch capabilities to deliver payloads to the lunar surface. As part of the efforts in Lander Technologies, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) is developing liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid methane (LCH 4) engine technology {{to share with the}} Lunar CATALYST partners. Liquid oxygen and liquid methane propellants are attractive owing to their relatively high specific impulse for chemical propulsion systems, modest storage requirements, and adaptability to NASA's Journey to Mars plans. Methane has also been viewed as a possible propellant choice for lunar missions, owing to the performance benefits and as a technology development stepping stone to Martian missions. However, in the development of methane propulsion, methane ignition has historically been viewed as a high risk area in the development of such an engine. A great deal of work has been conducted in the past decade devoted to risk reduction in LOX/CH 4 ignition. This paper will review and summarize the history and results of LOX/CH 4 ignition programs conducted at NASA. More recently, a NASA-developed Augmented Spark Impinging (ASI) igniter body, which utilizes a conventional spark exciter system, is being tested with LOX/CH 4 to help support internal and commercial engine development programs, such as those in Lunar CATALYST. One challenge with spark exciter systems, especially at altitude conditions, is the <b>ignition</b> <b>lead</b> that transmits the high voltage pulse from the exciter to the spark igniter (spark plug). The <b>ignition</b> <b>lead</b> can be prone to corona discharge, reducing the energy delivered by the spark and potentially causing non-ignition events. For the current work, a commercial compact exciter system, which eliminates this high voltage cabling, was tested at altitude conditions. A modified, conventional exciter system with an improved <b>ignition</b> <b>lead</b> was also recently tested at altitude conditions. This test program demonstrated the capability of these exciter systems to operate at altitude. While more extensive testing may be required, these systems or similar ones may be used for future NASA and commercial engine programs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Concern {{over the}} {{environment}} and=or {{the increasing demand}} for conventional fossil fuel has promoted interest {{in the development of}} alternative sources of fuel energy for internal combustion (IC) engines. The effect of advanced injection timing on the performance of natural gas used as primary fuel in dual-fuel combustion has been examined. Satisfactory diesel engine combustion demands self-ignition of the fuel as it is injected near the top dead centre (TDC) into the hot swirling compressed cylinder gas. Longer delays between injection and <b>ignition</b> <b>lead</b> to unacceptable rates of pressure rise (diesel knock) because too much fuel is ready to burn when combustion eventually occurs. Natural gas has been noted to exhibit longer ignition delays and slower burning rates especially at low load levels hence resulting in late combustion in the expansion stroke. Advanced injection timing is expected to compensate for these effects. The engine has standard injection timing of 30 before TDC (BTDC). The injection was first advanced by 5 : 5 given injection timing of 35 : 5 BTDC. The engine ran for about 5 minutes at this timing and stopped. The engine failed to start upon subsequent attempts. The injection was then advanced by 3 : 5 (i. e. 33 : 5 BTDC). The engine ran smoothly on this timing but seemed to incur penalty on fuel consumption especially at high load levels...|$|E

Fire statistics draw attention to the magnitude of smouldering combustion as the leading cause of fire deaths in residential areas (i.e., more than 25% of the fire deaths in the United States are attributed to smoulder-initiated fires, with similar figures in other developed countries). A particularly common fire scenario is a cigarette igniting a piece of upholstered furniture. This <b>ignition</b> <b>leads</b> to a smouldering fire that lasts for a long period of time (in the order of hours), spreading slowly and silently until critical conditions are attained and flames suddenly erupt; fire-resistant cigarettes have been developed to reduce the risk of fire due to smouldering. Smouldering combustion is also a fire-safety concern aboard space facilities (e.g., International Space Station), because the absence of gravity is thought to promote smouldering ignition and propagation.|$|R

The main objective of these tests was to start the ASI within the anticipated J- 2 X engine start box, as well as outside of it, to check for ignition margin. The setup for the J- 2 X ASI component testing simulated, as much as possible, the tank-head start-up configuration of the ASI within the J- 2 X Engine. The ignition tests were divided into 124 vacuum start tests to simulate altitude start on a flight engine, and 77 sea-level start tests to simulate the first set of ground tests for the J- 2 X Engine at Stennis Space Center (SSC). Other ignition parameters that were varied included propellant tank pressures, oxidizer temperature entering the ASI oxidizer feedline, oxidizer valve timing, spark igniter condition (new versus damaged), and oxidizer and fuel feedline orifice sizes. Propellant blowdowns using venturis sized to simulate the ASI resistance allowed calculation of transient propellant mass flow rates as well as global mixture ratio for all ignition tests. Global mixture ratio within the ASI at the time of ignition varied from 0. 2 to 1. 2. Detailed electronics data obtained from an instrumented <b>ignition</b> <b>lead</b> allowed characterization of the breakdown voltage, sustaining voltage and energy contained in each spark as the ASI propellants ignited.

30|$|The risk of {{explosion}} {{most notably}} exists for transportation of gases that are {{liquefied by cooling}} or high pressure. An explosion occurs when the energy stored in the gas is released in a short time. In a full vessel almost all gas will be in liquid phase. A rupture in a full vessel leads to a sudden pressure drop to ambient causing the liquid to boil. The quick change from liquid to gas phase cause an increase in volume. Depending on the vessel temperature a blast wave can occur, if the evaporation is fast enough. This process is called, boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion (BLEVE). In an almost empty vessel much fuel {{will be in the}} gas phase. In this case a rupture causes an expansion of the pressurized vapour. The resulting blast depends on the temperature, type and amount of gas, and the dimensions of the tunnel. These two bursting vessel scenarios, without <b>ignition,</b> <b>lead</b> to high explosion loads in the zone around the bursting vessel (200 – 500 kPa), but is reduced after a couple of metres when the blast is directed along the tunnel axis, at around 100 kPa. Once the gas has expanded, ignition, e.g. by a spark or a hot surface, can occur if the gas-air mixture is within flammability limits. Depending on the speed of the flame front and expansion from combustion, a deflagration (10 – 800 kPa for HC-air mixtures) or detonation (1500 – 2000 kPa for HC-air mixtures) can take place. Of these, a deflagration in the order of 100 kPa is the most plausible scenario. Detonation is less likely as it requires instantaneous release of an almost empty tank. A pressure of 100 kPa or larger will cause direct casualties from the blast (Weerheijm 2014).|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen {{is being}} {{considered}} as a sustainable future energy carrier with least environmental impact in terms of combustion by-products. It has unique physical properties of very wide flammability range, between 4 % to 75 % by volume and high flame speeds, which are challenging factors in designing safe hydrogen installations. An accidental release in enclosures can easily result {{in the formation of}} flammable mixtures, which may upon <b>ignition</b> <b>lead</b> to fast turbulent deflagrations or even transition to detonation. Explosion venting is frequently used to mitigate explosions in industry, but it is not straightforward to design vent systems that will reduce the explosion pressure sufficiently to prevent collapse of structures and formation of projectiles. Validated predictive techniques will be of assistance to quantified analysis of possible accidental scenarios and designing effective mitigation measures such as vents. While explosion venting has been previous studied experimentally and numerically, relatively little information has been gathered about the configurations used in hydrogen energy applications and in the presence of obstacles; a viable predictive technique for such scenario is still lacking. The use of standard 20 feet ISO shipping containers for self-contained portable hydrogen fuel cell power units is being widely considered. Fresh experiments for this configuration have been carried out by GexCon AS as part of the HySEA project supported by the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking (FCH 2 JU) under the Horizon 2020 Framework Program for Research and Innovation. In the present study, numerical modelling and simulations have been conducted to aid our understanding of the vented gas explosion in these self-contained portable power units using HyFOAM, an in-house modified version of the open source Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code OpenFOAM for vented hydrogen explosions.

30|$|Early {{snowmelt}} {{is one way}} {{to achieve}} low fuel moisture and extended fire seasons leading to increased annual area burned, yet it is certainly not the only mechanism. Climate indirectly affects wildfire occurrence, through control over fuel moisture (Gedalof et al. 2005, Miller et al. 2008, Littell et al. 2009, Fauria et al. 2011, Higuera et al. 2015). Dry fuel loads with adequate <b>ignitions</b> <b>lead</b> to wildfires. Fuel moisture is influenced by a variety of ecological and climatic processes including high summer temperatures, drought, and snowmelt timing. Of all the factors that lead to low fuel moisture, snowmelt timing is one of the earliest predictors, occurring several months before the fire season begins. Drought indexes, fuel moisture metrics, and spring-summer temperatures may be more highly correlated with annual area burned (Gedalof et al. 2005, Westerling et al. 2006, Miller et al. 2008, Spracklen et al. 2009, Higuera et al. 2015), but are temporally concurrent with wildfire season.

The geometrical {{features of the}} capillary inside which plasma propagates before in-air expansion, the pulse repetition rate {{and the presence of}} a metallic target are playing a key role on the rare gas flow at the outlet of the capillary when the plasma is switched on. In addition to the previously reported upstream offset of the laminar to turbulent transition, we document the reverse action leading to the generation of long plumes at moderate gas flow rates together with the channeling of helium flow under various discharge conditions.

40|$|Engine DesignThis {{project was}} aimed at {{developing}} an orbital internal combustion engine (ICE) technology that is able to combust {{a wide range of}} fuels that can be converted into useable energy that currently are not being utilized. The key difference that sets this engine apart from all other internal combustion engine’s is that the combustion chambers themselves rotate with the output shaft around a fixed cam. Similar orbital engine’s were used earlier in the 20 th century predominantly in aircrafts. These engine’s faded out of production in the 1950 ’s due to high maintenance demands due to worn cams and lubrication issues. With the today’s technologic improvements, the shortfalls of the engine can now be mitigated with advances in material science lubricants and manufacturing. These engine’s offer comparatively high outputs and never before have they been modeled to explore their true potential. The concept engine being investigated operates at a very slow speed and has the advantage of being able to alter the piston trajectory by altering the cam geometry. This level of customization is impossible in traditional crank slider configurations. The slower rpm allows the combustion of very low grade fuels that are currently not being utilized commercially as an energy source while producing good output when compared to current internal combustion technologies. Conventional engine simulation software was used to explore the performance potential for this engine configuration. An initial simulation model was verified against an existing prototype and a second model was created to aid in a second generation engine that is currently being developed. These models were used to explore the engine’s capability and optimal configuration. The results of a multitude of simulations were used to create a calculator for industry that uses Microsoft excel to access and interpolate from the data to predict performance for possible variants and to aid in future prototype designs without the need for the software package. The primary focus of the research was to investigate how engine performance was affected by manipulating the piston trajectory, velocity and dwell time near TDC and BDC by adjusting the cam profile. This has proven to have very large implications concerning the engine’s output. It was discovered that by prolonging the time the piston spent at the extremities of its stroke (relative to crank rotation, or in this case, engine rotation) greatly improved combustion and engine performance. Prolonging the time the piston spends near bottom dead centre (BDC) allowed more time for air and fuel to enter the combustion chamber. With the addition of a highly pressurized crankcase, this proved to highly successful in improving performance at higher RPM. Prolonging the time the piston spends near top dead centre (TDC) after <b>ignition</b> <b>lead</b> too much higher pressure being developed during the power stroke, which is advantageous for volumetric efficiency and combusting slower burning fuels. Increasing the dwell time at TDC had the most benefit to performance predominantly at lower RPM. These tuning capabilities make the engine very versatile and highly desirable. The results of tuning the piston trajectories using Ricardo Wave software has lead to a potential 60 % increase in peak torque on the engine as well as raising the torque delivery over the entire RPM spectrum. This analysis also provided critical information to aid {{in the development of the}} 2 nd generation engine in respect to breathing and the forces acting on each of the engine components. This research into the influence of dwell and how it can be manipulated to improve the efficiency of combustion is likely to have influences in other ICE applications and development and help push the envelope for better efficiencies and the use of alternative fuels...|$|E

The resulting combustion process was compared with the one obtained triggering the mixture ignition with a traditional spark plug. The combustion process was characterized for different air-methane ratios. The {{results show that the}} ignition with nanotubes determines a higher combustion pressure gradient and a higher peak pressure than spark ignition for all the tested air-methane ratios. Furthermore, high-speed camera images show that the <b>ignition</b> with nanotubes <b>leads</b> to a more distributed homogeneous-like combustion and then a faster consumption of the air-methane mixture without the formation of a discernible flame front...|$|R
40|$|Constant {{pressure}} outwardly propagating flame {{experiments in}} a spherical bomb are performed {{to examine the}} duration and radius over which spark ignition effects persist. This is motivated {{by the need to}} properly account for such effects in the measurement of laminar burning velocity and Markstein length using the spark ignited expanding flame technique. Ignition energy was varied and its effects on flame propagation in methane-air and isooctane-air mixtures were studied. The Markstein length of the mixture proved critical in the ignition energy dependency of flame propagation. For relatively high values, an underlying common variation of self-sustaining flame speed with radius can be identified by the rapid convergence of curves for different ignition energies. As the Markstein length decreases, low energy spark ignition is found to give rise to a distorted and wrinkled flame kernel. For such mixtures, due to the weak effect of stretch, the kernel subsequently develops into a non-spherically propagating flame. In these cases the spark ignition effect persists up to large radius. It is shown that using low <b>ignition</b> energy <b>leads</b> to a flame speed, during the development phase, which is higher than that of a self-sustaining spherical flame. It is further shown that if this effect is not accounted for, measurements of Markstein length using standard fitting techniques results in a large error. This problem is found to worsen as the Markstein length decreases, such that its apparent measured value becomes increasingly influenced by any distortions of the flame kernel produced by the spark...|$|R
40|$|The {{control of}} {{ignition}} in a rocket engine {{is a critical}} problem for combustion chamber design. Delayed <b>ignition</b> may <b>lead</b> to high-amplitude pressure fluctuations that can damage the burner (strong ignition), whereas early ignition may fail. This paper describes a numerical study of a strong ignition sequence observed in a laboratory-scale single-injector rocket chamber ignited by a laser and fueled with gaseous oxygen and hydrogen. OH-emission images, Schlieren pictures, and pressure measurements {{make it possible to}} follow the flame propagation experimentally. The present large eddy simulation (LES) approach includes shock treatment, a six species–seven reaction chemical scheme for H 2 –O 2, and a model for the energy deposition by a laser. Flame/turbulence interaction is modeled with the thickened flame concept. LES is used to compute both the filling phase (during which the gaseous hydrogen and oxygen mix) and the ignition phase. The flame location and structure, as well as the temporal evolution of the chamber pressure obtained numerically, are in good agreement with the experiment. The use of complex chemistry in the computation also allows the comparison of LES data with experimental OH-images and shows that the sensitivity of the CCD camera used to record the spontaneous emission of the OH∗ radical is not high enough to properly locate the flame front in rich regions. The combined experimental and numerical results lead to a more detailed analysis of the ignition processes and its coupling with flow rate oscillations in the H 2 and O 2 feeding lines...|$|R
30|$|Discrepancies in fire {{reporting}} data {{contribute to}} {{uncertainty in the}} calculation of fire duration. The official start date is often when smoke was first reported rather than the day of lightning <b>ignition.</b> This could <b>lead</b> to an underestimation of fire duration throughout the suppression era. For this study, fire start dates taken from fire reports or summary tables were in most instances verified to reflect {{the date of the}} lightning strike using information reported by lookout tower operators. At times, especially from the mid 1980 s on, it appears that fire declared-out dates were several days or weeks after fires last exhibited any activity (smoke or heat). Considering the history of fires emerging from apparent dormancy and exhibiting aggressive fire behavior several days after appearing (see case studies, above), this is a prudent policy. However, {{it is likely that the}} mean fire duration date for suppressed fires would be reduced if the correct date of the last observed smoke was consistently available. Correct ending dates would reduce the mean fire duration for the 1980 s and 1990 s (Table 1).|$|R
40|$|The {{form of the}} {{ignition}} branch for steady, counterflow, hydrogen-oxygen diffusion flames, with dilution permitted in both streams, is investigated for two-step reduced chemistry by methods of bifurcation theory. Attention is restricted to fuel-stream temperatures {{less than or equal}} to the oxidizer-stream temperature Tx and to T „ larger than or of the order of the crossover temperature Tc at which the rates of production and consumption of H atoms are equal. Two types of solutions are identified, a frozen solution that always exists in this kinetic approximation because all rates are proportional to the concentration of the inter-medíate H atom, and an ignited solution, represented by a branch of the curve giving the máximum H concentration in terms of a Damkohler number constructed from the strain rate and the rate of the branching step H + Os- • OH + O. For T „> T „ the latter bifurcates from the frozen solution if the Damkohler number is increased to a critical valué. For T „ larger than a valué Ts> Tc, the effeets of chemical heat reléase are small, and ignition is always gradual in the sense that the limiting ignited-branch slope is positive (supercritical bifurcation) and there is no S curve. For T „ in the range Tc< T „ < T „ the heat reléase associated with the radical-consumption step causes the limiting ignition-branch slope to become negative (subcritical bifurcation), producing abrupt <b>ignition</b> which <b>leads</b> to an S curve. For valúes of Tx below crossover, the ignited branch appears as a C-shaped curve unconnected to the frozen solution. The method of analysis introduced here offers a first step toward analytical description of nonpremixed H 2 - 02 autoignition...|$|R
