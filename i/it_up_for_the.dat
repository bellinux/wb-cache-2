25|$|Meanwhile, the James {{brothers}} {{joined with}} Cole Younger {{and his brothers}} John, Jim and Bob, as well as Clell Miller and other former Confederates, to form {{what came to be}} known as the James–Younger Gang. With Jesse James as the most public face of the gang (though with operational leadership likely shared among the group), the gang carried out a string of robberies from Iowa to Texas, and from Kansas to West Virginia. They robbed banks, stagecoaches and a fair in Kansas City, often carrying out their crimes in front of crowds, and even hamming <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bystanders.|$|E
25|$|New York now had the {{momentum}} {{and would not}} give <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of the game. On Kansas City's ensuing drive, New York defenders Harry Hamilton and Russell Carter shared a tackle on running back Larry Moriarty, forcing a fumble that was recovered by linebacker Kyle Clifton. Ryan then converted the turnover with a 1-yard touchdown pass to McNeil. The Chiefs were forced to punt on their next possession due to a sack by Mark Gastineau, and the Jets increased their lead to 21-6 with another score. The key player on this drive was receiver Al Toon, who made a 30-yard reception from Ryan, and later finished the drive with an 11-yard touchdown catch.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} week of play, LSU {{traveled}} to Ladd Stadium in Mobile, Alabama and defeated the Alabama Crimson Tide, 13–3 in coach Bear Bryant's first game with the team. Paul Dietzel had previously served as an assistant coach for Bryant during his tenure at Kentucky. Neither teams' defense allowed a score in the first quarter. In the second quarter, Cannon fumbled at Alabama's 45-yard line, and Duff Morrison picked <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Tide and returned it to the LSU 5-yard line. Here, the Chinese Bandits had the first of their famous goal-line stands, and held Alabama to a field goal. Alabama's defensive line and linebackers made it difficult for LSU to run the ball in the first half, and they also put pressure on Rabb during passing plays. The Crimson Tide went into halftime with a 3–0 lead. Midway through the half, a section of bleachers in the north end zone collapsed and resulted in 60 spectators being injured. The collapse caused a stoppage of play while emergency responders worked to assist those injured by the collapse.|$|E

25|$|Three {{plays into}} the final quarter, New England fumbled another punt return, this one lost by Roland James, and Miami took over on the Patriots 10-yard line. This time, they took {{advantage}} of their scoring opportunity with Marino's 10-yard touchdown pass to Tony Nathan on the next play, cutting their deficit to 24–14. Things looked even more promising for the Dolphins when they forced a punt {{and drove to the}} New England 38-yard line. But then Carter fumbled the ball and defensive end Julius Adams pick <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Patriots fourth fumble recovery of the day. New England then put the game away with a 9-play drive, featuring a 14-yard run by Tony Collins and a 13-yard carry by James. Tatupu later finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run, putting the score out of reach at 31–14. With 7:34 left in the game, Miami mounted one last spirited drive, moving the ball to the NE 8-yard line. But two penalties pushed them back to the 28, and then a desperate pass from Marino was picked off by Raymond Clayborn in the end zone.|$|E

The mobsters are cruel to Viv and, when she says she does not want to dance with them, they attack her, holding her down and starting to remove her top.

They also [...] "completely trashed" [...] the street sets in the studio. [...] "Next Tuesday" [...] was considered a bottle episode as it was largely filmed in one set, a water tank some 14 feet deep and 70 feet long, in a studio. The episode was filmed over five 13-hour days, not including a two-day break midway through, becoming the fastest time filming a Sanctuary episode. Wood directed the episode from the water rather than dry land.

[...] He concluded by stating [...] "that a giant telepathic alien manatee is involved should by no means discourage viewing." [...] The Daily Mirrors Jane Simon also selected the episode as her single pick of the day, praising scenes where Rhys and Torchwood formulate their infiltration plan as containing [...] "the kind of sharp, sarcastic banter that made Buffy such fun to watch". However, she felt that it was a [...] "shame they can't keep <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> entire episode." [...] Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy gave the episode four out of five stars, feeling it to be a [...] "juicy treat to devour, combining heightened drama, genuine emotion and nice touches of humour." [...] He praised the decision to foreground the character of Rhys, the contrast he provided to the operations of the Torchwood team and the realism of the arguments between him and Gwen. He also felt that the episode's [...] "eco-friendly plot" [...] made it easy to sympathise with the alien space whale stating [...] "the emotive howls of pain, big puppy-dog eyes and heartfelt score all [...] to test the tear ducts." [...] However, he criticised the human antagonists for being [...] "two-dimensional plot functions rather than humans" [...] and pointed out the [...] "moral black hole" [...] of Torchwood continuing to buy meat products despite condemning the plight of the space whale. Richard Edwards of SFX magazine also gave the episode four stars, feeling it highlighted how the [...] "series has evolved" [...] in that [...] "the in-fighting and gratuitous swearing have been replaced with slick dialogue that sizzles with humour and drama– not to mention a team that feels like a properly cohesive unit." [...] He also praised the increased role of Rhys and opined that the episode made the relationship between him and Gwen [...] "the show's most believable." [...] However, he felt that Jack, as the leader of a top secret organisation, should have pressed harder to have Rhys' memory wiped.|$|E

2500|$|In the show, Billingsley often {{could be}} seen doing {{household}} chores wearing pearls and earrings. The pearls, which in real life were Billingsley's trademark, were, in turn, her idea to have her alter ego wear on television.

2500|$|From late December 1813 Farquhar's squadron, {{comprising}} Desiree, Hearty, Blazer, Piercer, Shamrock, Redbreast, {{and eight}} gun-boats (the seven from Cuxhaven plus No. 12), supported Swedish forces {{under the command}} of General Baron de Boye against the Danes in the attack on the town and fortress of Glückstadt at the Elbe river during the War of the Sixth Coalition. The British arrived on 23 December and by 25 December had erected a battery of two 32-pounder guns. (They had landed six but the poor quality of the roads meant that only two were in place.) To support the bombardment on the next day, Farquhar sent in the gunboats and the brigs, whose armament he had reinforced with two 18-pounders each from Desiree. The bombardment continued to the 28th. Glückstadt having failed to surrender, Farquhar established three more batteries, one of two 18-pounders, one of four 32-pounders, and one of the two 13" [...] mortars captured at Cuxhaven.
