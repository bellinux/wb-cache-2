The northern mountains are outliers of the Tibetan Plateau, with many species of montane birds, and in winter the avifauna is augmented by migrants from the eastern Palearctic and Himalayas.|$|E

5|$|Antarctica is a {{de facto}} condominium, governed by parties to the Antarctic Treaty System that have {{consulting}} status. Twelve countries signed the Antarctic Treaty in 1959, and thirty-eight have signed it since then. The treaty prohibits military activities and mineral mining, prohibits nuclear explosions and nuclear waste disposal, supports scientific research, and protects the continent's <b>ecozone.</b> Ongoing experiments are conducted by more than 4,000 scientists from many nations.|$|E
5|$|The Northwest Power and Conservation Council {{divides the}} Kootenay River {{watershed}} into six biomes: aquatic (rivers and lakes), riparian zones, wetlands, grassland/shrubs, moderately wet forest, and dry forest. The forested zones extend through the alpine and subalpine {{reaches of the}} watershed, while grasslands dominate the low terraces and plateaus surrounding the river, especially in the Lake Koocanusa area and the Montana-Idaho portion of the watershed. In the Canada portion of the watershed, an alpine meadow <b>ecozone</b> occupies most of the high ridges and valleys of the mountains.|$|E
5|$|The fauna of Scotland is {{generally}} {{typical of the}} northwest European part of the Palearctic <b>ecozone,</b> although several of the country's larger mammals were hunted to extinction in historic times and human activity has also led to various species of wildlife being introduced. Scotland's diverse temperate environments support 62 species of wild mammals, including a population of wild cats, important numbers of grey and harbour seals and the most northerly colony of bottlenose dolphins in the world.|$|E
30|$|Significantly, {{over the}} whole country, the <b>ecozones</b> with the lowest fire {{frequency}} in the past 50 yr (Figure 5; Stocks et al. 2003) compared to long-term fire frequency (Table 2) are southern areas (e.g., Montane Cordillera and {{the northern edge of}} Plains <b>ecozones).</b> Although some of these areas may have experienced an increase in precipitation in the last century compared to other <b>ecozones</b> due to heterogeneity in climatic fluctuations across the northern hemisphere (Girardin et al. 2009), they currently have the most days of any Canadian regions during which FWI conditions are high (Figures 3 and 4; Table 1). The long-term decrease in burn areas in these <b>ecozones</b> is thus likely due to other factors interacting with climatic variation.|$|R
40|$|Geographic {{information}} systems (GIS) data was {{used on a}} global scale {{to examine the relationship between}} climate (<b>ecozones),</b> water navigability, and economic development in terms of GDP per capita. GDP per capita and the spatial density of economic activity measured as GDP per km 2 are high in temperate <b>ecozones</b> and in regions proximate to the sea (within 100 km of the ocean or a sea-navigable waterway). Temperate <b>ecozones</b> proximate to the sea account for 8 percent of the world’s inhabited land area, 23 percent of the world’s population, and 53 percent of the world’s GDP. The GDP densities in temperate <b>ecozones</b> proximate to the sea are on average eighteen times higher than in non-proximate non-temperate areas. ...|$|R

5|$|Lord Howe Island is a {{distinct}} terrestrial ecoregion known as the Lord Howe Island subtropical forests. It {{is part of the}} Australasia <b>ecozone</b> and shares many biotic affinities with Australia, New Guinea, and New Caledonia. Almost half of the island's native plants are endemic and many of the island's unique plants grow on or around the mountain summits where the height has allowed the development of a true cloud forest and many different microhabitats from sealevel to the summits. One of the best known is Howea, an endemic genus of palms (Arecaceae) that are commonly known as kentia palms and make handsome houseplants. Annual exports provide a revenue of over A$2million, providing the only major industry on the island apart from tourism.|$|E
5|$|Mayflies are {{distributed}} {{all over the}} world in clean freshwater habitats, though absent from Antarctica. They tend to be absent from oceanic islands or represented by one or two species that have dispersed from nearby mainland. Female mayflies may be dispersed by wind, and eggs may be transferred by adhesion to the legs of waterbirds. The greatest generic diversity is found in the Neotropic <b>ecozone,</b> while the Holarctic has a smaller number of genera but a high degree of speciation. Some thirteen families are restricted to a single bioregion. The main families have some general habitat preferences: the Baetidae favour warm water; the Heptageniidae live under stones and prefer fast-flowing water; and the relatively large Ephemeridae make burrows in sandy lake or river beds.|$|E
5|$|The flora of Scotland is an {{assemblage}} of native plant species including over 1,600 vascular plants, more than 1,500 lichens and nearly 1,000 bryophytes. The total number of vascular species is low by world standard but lichens and bryophytes are abundant and the latter form a population of global importance. Various populations of rare fern exist, although the impact of 19th-century collectors threatened the existence of several species. The flora is generally typical of the north west European part of the Palearctic <b>ecozone</b> and prominent features of the Scottish flora include boreal Caledonian forest (much reduced from its natural extent), heather moorland and coastal machair. In addition to the native varieties of vascular plants there are numerous non-native introductions, now believed to make up some 43% of the species in the country.|$|E

5|$|India {{lies within}} the Indomalaya <b>ecozone</b> and {{contains}} three biodiversity hotspots. One of 17 megadiverse countries, it hosts 8.6% of all mammalian, 13.7% of all avian, 7.9% of all reptilian, 6% of all amphibian, 12.2% of all piscine, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species. About 21.2% of the country's landmass {{is covered by}} forests (tree canopy density >10%), of which 12.2% comprises moderately or very dense forests (tree canopy density >40%). Endemism is high among plants, 33%, and among ecoregions such as the shola forests. Habitat ranges from the tropical rainforest of the Andaman Islands, Western Ghats, and North-East India to the coniferous forest of the Himalaya. Between these extremes lie the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern India; the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India; and the babul-dominated thorn forest of the central Deccan and western Gangetic plain. The medicinal neem, widely used in rural Indian herbal remedies, is a key Indian tree. The luxuriant pipal fig tree, shown on the seals of Mohenjo-daro, shaded Gautama Buddha as he sought enlightenment.|$|E
25|$|Except for the Arctic Ocean {{coastal plain}} and high elevations, most of Yukon {{is in the}} boreal forest ecoregion.

However, bordering the Taiga Shield seems to affect neither itself nor the ecozones it borders because their biological properties appear to be opposites (cold climate versus warm climate; different species of plants and animals). While the Arctic Cordillera mountain system includes most of the Arctic islands and regions such as Bathurst Island, Cornwall Island, Amund Ringnes Island, Ellef Ringnes Island, Ellesmere Island, Baffin Island, Bylot Island and Labrador, the Arctic Cordillera <b>Ecozone</b> only covers Ellesmere Island, Baffin Island, Axel Heiberg Island, Bylot Island and Labrador.|$|E

25|$|Southwestern Ontario and {{a narrow}} strip {{along the coast}} of the Saint Lawrence River are in the Mixedwood Plains, a fertile and {{productive}} <b>ecozone</b> that is typically flat with rolling hills, and was once covered by forest before its use for agriculture, and later urbanization, resulted in deforestation of vast swaths of the area. To its north is the Boreal Shield, the largest provincial <b>ecozone,</b> extending from south-central Ontario to cover most of northern Ontario, where it abuts the Hudson Plains. The Northwestern Ontario portion of this area is part of the Midwestern Canadian Shield forests ecoregion of boreal forest that spreads west through Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The plains that cover the heartland of Ontario are a transitional <b>ecozone</b> characterized by boreal features in the south and tundra landscapes in the north. This extends the entire range of the northern coast of Ontario with Hudson Bay and James Bay, at which numerous wetlands act as staging and nesting grounds for migratory birds.
