The phase microstress in the axial direction is obtained. It is found that the cementite lamellae are subjected to a high tensile stress, up to 2000 MPa, after cold drawing. Measurements on <b>etched</b> <b>wires</b> showed that the phase microstress is nearly constant with {{the distance to the}} wire axis. Combination of these data with complementary X-ray diffraction measurements on the ferrite determines the response of each phase to the macrostress or an applied stress. Additionally, the peak broadening and texture of both phases have been studied using the neutron diffraction technique. The texture is less sharp in the cementite than in the ferrite.

40|$|The {{controlled}} {{depletion of}} electrons in semiconductors {{is the basis}} for numerous devices. Reactive-ion etching provides an effective technique for fabricating both classical and quantum devices. However, Fermi level pinning can occur, and must be carefully considered in the development of small devices, such as quantum dots. Because of depletion, the electrical size of the device is reduced in comparison with its physical dimension. To investigate this issue, we fabricate several types of devices in silicon-germanium heterostructures using two different etches, CF$_ 4 $ and SF$_ 6 $. We estimate the depletion width associated with each etch by two methods: (i) conductance measurements in <b>etched</b> <b>wires</b> of decreasing thickness (to determine the onset of depletion), (ii) capacitance measurements of quantum dots (to estimate the size of the active region).

Potentiodynamic and ASTM F 746 potentiostatic tests in a 0. 9 % NaCl solution were conducted on wires in their as-received, chemically etched, aged in boiling water, and electropolished states. As-received wires with various surface finishes revealed breakdown potentials in the range from - 100 mV to + 500 mV; similar passive current density, 10 (- 6) A/cm(2); and a wide hysteresis on the reverse scan, demonstrating strong susceptibility to localized corrosion. Chemically <b>etched</b> <b>wires</b> with original black oxide displayed consistent corrosion performance and surpassed, in corrosion resistance, electropolished wires that showed significantly lower breakdown (400 - 700 mV) and localized corrosion potentials (similar to - 50 to + 113 mV). Sandblasted and fine-drawn wires exhibited rather inconsistent corrosion behavior. In potentiodynamic tests these wires could perform with equal probability either on the level of pretreated BO wires or rather similar to as-received wires. Both SB and FD wires revealed low breakdown potentials in the PS regime. SEM analysis performed before tests indicated that sandblasting was not efficient for the complete removal of the original scaling, and fine drawing aggravated the situation, resulting in a persistent scaling that contributed to the inferior corrosion performance. Inclusions (oxides, carbides, and oxidized carbides) inherited from the bulk and retained on electropolished surfaces are the cause of their inferior performance compared to chemically etched surfaces. In electropolished wires corrosion was initiated around inclusions. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} quantum {{theory of the}} {{nonlinear}} interaction between intense surface acoustic waves and electrons of a quantum well in the regime of moving quantum wires and dots. The quantum nonlinear interaction qualitatively differs from the classical one. In a system of electron wires driven by an acoustic wave the sound attenuation strongly decreases with increasing the sound intensity. However, even in the quantum limit the sound attenuation in the electron system remains nonzero due to residual scattering by impurities in the lowest subband. In the case of electron dots formed by two waves moving in the perpendicular directions, the calculated dissipation vanishes at high sound intensity because of the fully quantized spectrum. Besides, moving quantum dots can be formed by a single acoustic wave propagating along a system of <b>etched</b> quantum <b>wires.</b> We show that the quantum regime of the attenuation can exist in high-mobility GaAs quantum wells where the heating can not destroy the quantum state.

A surprising observation is that this mechanism for suppressing spin dephasing is not only effective for electrons in the heterojunction quantum well but also for electrons in a deeper bulk layer. ...|$|R

40|$|Active {{interrogation}} {{systems for}} {{highly enriched uranium}} require improved fieldable neutron sources. The target technology for deuterium-tritium neutron generators is well understood and the most significant improvement {{can be achieved by}} improving the deuterium ion source through increased output and, in some cases, lifetime of the ion source. We are developing a new approach to a deuterium ion sources based upon the field desorption/evaporation of deuterium from the surfaces of metal tips. Electrostatic field desorption (EFD) desorbs previously adsorbed deuterium as ions under the influence of high electric fields (several), without removing tip material. Single <b>etched</b> <b>wire</b> tip experiments have been performed and have shown that this is difficult but can be achieved with molybdenum and tungsten tips. Electrostatic field evaporation (EFE) evaporates ultra thin deuterated titanium films as ions. It has been shown that several 10 s of atomic layers can be removed within a few nanoseconds from etched tungsten tips. In the course of these studies titanium deposition and deuteration methods were studied and new detection methods developed. Space charge effects resulting from the large ion currents were identified to be the most likely cause of some unusual ion emission characteristics. In addition, on W oriented substrates a surprising body-centered cubic crystal structure of the titanium film was found and studied. The ion currents required for neutron generator applications can be achieved by microfabrication of metal tip arrays. Field desorption studies of microfabricated field emitter tip arrays have been conducted for the first time. Maximum fields of 3 have been applied to the array tip surfaces to date, although fields of ∼ 2 to ∼ 2. 5 are more typical. Desorption of atomic deuterium ions has been observed at fields of roughly 2 at room temperature. The desorption of common surface adsorbates, such as hydrogen, carbon, water, and carbon monoxide is observed at fields exceeding ∼ 1. In vacuo heating of the arrays to temperatures of the order of 800 can be effective in removing many of the surface contaminants observed. For both the field desorption and the field evaporation approaches further improvements to array design and fabrication are required if arrays are to provide sufficient deuterium ion currents to produce 10 ^ 9 to 10 ^ 10 n/cm^ 2 of tip array area for the detection systems.

40|$|We {{describe}} an apparatus designed to quantitatively measure friction dynamics at the mesoscopic scale. This lateral force apparatus, LFA, uses double parallel leaf springs in leaf-spring units as force transducers and two focus error detection optical heads, optical heads, to measure deflections. The {{design of the}} leaf-spring units is new. Normal spring constants {{are in the range}} of 20 – 4000 N/m, and lateral spring constants are 7 – 1000 N/m. The optical heads combine a 10 nm sensitivity with a useful range of about 100 µm. The proven range of normal forces is 400 nN– 150 mN. The leaf-spring units transduce friction and normal forces independently. Absolute values of normal and friction forces are calibrated. Typical errors are less than 10 %. The calibration is partly in situ, for the sensitivity of the optical heads, and partly ex situ for the normal and lateral spring constants of the leaf-spring units. There is minimal coupling between the deflection measurements in the lateral and normal directions. This coupling is also calibrated in situ. It is typically 1 % and can be as low as 0. 25 %. This means that the displacements of the tip can be measured accurately in the sliding direction and normal to the surface. Together, these characteristics make the LFA, well suited for quantitative study of friction dynamics at mesoscopic scales. Furthermore the design of the leaf-spring unit allows exchange of tips which may be fabricated (e. g., <b>etched)</b> from <b>wire</b> material (d 0. 4 mm) and can have customized shapes, e. g., polished flat squares.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to produce an ion source with a high {{brightness}} and low energy spread. Two approaches were taken, an existing high brightness ion source (the liquid metal ion source) was monochromated to reduce its energy spread; this work was carried out at the University of York. The second approach {{was to develop a}} novel high brightness ion source with an intrinsically low energy spread. This approach was carried out at the University of Warwick. Several potential monochromators were simulated and the concentric hemispherical analyser was found to be the most suitable. Liquid metal ion sources were fabricated for monochromation by the author. However, these sources did not prove to be sufficiently stable for energy spread measurements and electron sources were used to try to demonstrate the principal. Ultimately this approach did not prove successful and the alternative ofdeveloping a novel source was pursued.
