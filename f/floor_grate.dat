5|$|Private William Hudson (Bill Paxton) is the Colonial Marines' comedian and comtech expert. Arrogant and overconfident, he soon cracks {{under the}} stress of the failed {{incursion}} into the Alien hive. Hudson despairs and panics until Ripley and Newt reassure him, enabling him to regain his composure. He fights to the end in the colony's operation room, where the survivors of the party make their final stand, and is pulled through a <b>floor</b> <b>grate</b> by an Alien while providing cover fire. In Aliens: Colonial Marines, Hudson's corpse was discovered in the sewers with a large hole in his chest, revealing that Hudson was impregnated by a Facehugger after he was dragged beneath the grates and later died when a chestburster erupted from his chest.|$|E

50|$|One {{theory that}} {{would support the}} {{fracturing}} of the hull is that the Titanic partly grounded on the shelf of ice below the waterline as she collided with the iceberg, perhaps damaging the keel and underbelly.

50|$|The free-flow {{combat system}} that {{is present in the}} other Arkham games has been built from the ground up. Batman still moves from left to right, but has the ability to be in the {{foreground}} or the background. Director Mark Pacini added that they've included a few more layers to the predator/detective mode. Players are able to see the sightlines of the enemies, which immediately allows to know whether Batman can be seen or not by enemies. When Batman is in detective mode, Batman changes color based on their proximity or based on how close he is to being seen. Vantage points, <b>floor</b> <b>grates,</b> silent takedowns, glide kicks, weapon use, and breakable walls return from the console games as well.|$|R
5|$|The {{player can}} use predatory tactics through stealthincluding silent takedowns, {{dropping}} from overhead perches and snatching enemies away, or using the explosive gel to knock foes off their feetto tilt the odds in their favor. Some areas feature sections {{that require the}} player to use these tactics to avoid alerting the Joker's henchmen and thus failing to meet an objective. Many areas feature stone gargoyles placed high above, helping Batman remain concealed. Batman can use his grapnel gun to reach the gargoyles, giving him a high vantage point over the area and the enemies. From the gargoyles, Batman can glide down to attack enemies or hang upside down from the gargoyles to grapple a nearby enemy and leave him tethered there. The player can use <b>floor</b> <b>grates</b> to attack from below, hide around corners, use batarangs to stun enemies from afar, and use the grapnel gun to pull enemies over ledges.|$|R

Pecos then appears and plucks another whisker from Tom's face. An angry Tom seizes Pecos, but Jerry arrives, rescuing his uncle again by squirting a tube of toothpaste into Tom's face, with the toothpaste forming into a pair of glasses. As Jerry makes a run back to the mouse hole with Pecos, they fall through a <b>floor</b> <b>grate.</b> Tom arrives and listens to Pecos continuing to play his guitar until he breaks another string and claims he needs another whisker. Scared of feeling any more pain due to another whisker being plucked, Tom barricades the grate and flees.

50|$|The wooden {{bridge deck}} was {{replaced}} in 1950 with steel grating, and the streetcar tracks were removed, as interurban rail service was discontinued in 1948. By 1987, the floor beams had become structurally unsound for automobile traffic due to extensive corrosion. A self-supporting, load-bearing deck structure, {{known as a}} Bailey Truss, was installed inside the trusses of the Bridgeport Bridge. This was only a temporary measure, as the bridge was replaced in 1998 with the adjacent Military Order of the Purple Heart Bridge. Sometime in 2009 much of the temporary Bailey Truss was removed. It is unclear if the steel <b>grate</b> <b>floor</b> had been removed prior to {{the installation of the}} Bailey Truss, but after the removal of its floor structure the Bridgeport Bridge was without a floor.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} manage their waste, CAFOs have {{developed}} Agricultural wastewater treatment plans. To save on manual labor, many CAFOs handle manure waste as a liquid. In this system, the animals are kept in pens with <b>grated</b> <b>floors</b> so the waste and spray water can be drained from underfloor gutters and piped to storage tanks or anaerobic lagoons. Once at a lagoon, {{the purpose is to}} treat the waste and make it suitable for spreading on agricultural fields. There are three main types of lagoon: anaerobic, which is inhibited by oxygen; aerobic, which requires oxygen; and facultative, which is maintained with or without oxygen. Aerobic lagoons provide a higher degree of treatment with less odor production, though they require a significant amount of space and maintenance. Because of this demand, almost all livestock lagoons are anaerobic lagoons.|$|R
5000|$|The Elimination Chamber, {{which was}} created by Triple H and {{introduced}} by Eric Bischoff for WWE in 2002, is a large, circular steel cage that surrounds the ring entirely, including creating a <b>grated</b> <b>floor</b> area on the apron. Inside the cage, at each turnbuckle, is a clear [...] "pod" [...] where {{four of the six}} competitors in the match must wait to be released to join the two who start at the opening bell. As the name implies, wrestlers are eliminated one-by-one via pinfall or submission until only one remains. An Extreme Elimination Chamber took place at the 2006 December to Dismember pay-per-view, where a weapon was given to each wrestler waiting in a pod. The metal is black and the chambers are made of 'bulletproof glass'. The chamber is 36 ft in diameter and is composed of 16 tons of steel and 2 mi of chain. Since 2010, WWE held a pay-per-view of the same name every February, featuring this match type as one of its marquee matches. In 2015, this event was replaced with WWE's new pay-per-view event Fastlane. The Elimination Chamber returned as a WWE Network exclusive on May 31 to decide a new WWE Intercontinental Champion and WWE Tag Team Champions.|$|R
50|$|Each level {{starts with}} Roger {{climbing}} up a ladder {{set into the}} floor, and the player completes the level by arriving back at this ladder with Rover - at which point Roger climbs down with Rover. Gameplay involves getting Rover out repeatedly {{in a set of}} increasingly difficult levels, by moving objects around in a grid to open up a path to get to the dog and then bring it back out. There are four different types of robot in the game, each with different behaviour. One type shoots Roger if he stands in front of it, but doesn't move, another type runs around and shoots Roger if he is seen, another type chases Roger around, and the last type runs around and kills Roger if it runs into him. To get to Rover, the player must normally avoid, trap or destroy them. There are various items which Roger can push around in the world: crates (which float on water), mirror blocks (which reflect lasers at an angle), star pearls and anti-gravity carts. Other items in the areas are <b>grated</b> <b>floors</b> (which robots cannot travel on), glowing floors (which Roger cannot travel on), water (including moving water in which crates float with the current), laser projectors, teleporters and force doors (which need an access card in order to be opened).|$|R
40|$|Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 is only {{occasionally}} isolated from healthy swine, but some experimentally infected animals will shed the organism in their feces {{for at least}} 2 months. Potential explanations for the paucity of naturally occurring infections in swine, as compared to cattle, include a lack of animal-to-animal transmission so that the organism cannot be maintained within a herd, a high infectious dose, or herd management practices that prevent {{the maintenance of the}} organism in the gastrointestinal tract. We hypothesized that donor pigs infected with E. coli O 157 :H 7 would transmit the organism to naïve pigs. We also determined the infectious dose and whether housing pigs individually on <b>grated</b> <b>floors</b> would decrease the magnitude or duration of fecal shedding. Infected donor pigs shedding < 104 CFU of E. coli O 157 :H 7 per g transmitted the organism to 6 of 12 naïve pigs exposed to them. The infectious dose of E. coli O 157 :H 7 for 3 -month-old pigs was approximately 6 × 103 CFU. There was no difference in the magnitude and duration of fecal shedding by pigs housed individually on grates compared to those housed two per pen on cement floors. These results suggest that swine do not have an innate resistance to colonization by E. coli O 157 :H 7 and that they could serve as a reservoir host under suitable conditions...|$|R
40|$|Baling silage {{with oxygen}} {{can result in}} dry matter {{deterioration}} and reduce silage intake by animals. This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the effects of two different wrapping sources and time intervals between baling and wrapping on intake and digestibility of alfalfa silage. The second objective was to assess the correlation of alfalfa silage fermentation parameters with intake and digestibility parameters in gestating sheep. Alfalfa silage was baled in large round bales then wrapped with plastic either with (KURA) or without (SUN) an oxygen-limiting barrier either the day of baling or 1, 2 or 3 d after baling. Beginning in January, silages were chopped and packed into plastic-lined trash containers, then offered randomly for ad libitum consumption to 16 gestating ewes (n = 16; 63. 5 ± 1. 71 kg BW) to provide 2 observations per treatment for 3 experimental periods. Each period consisted of a 10 -d dietary adaptation period followed by 7 d of total fecal and urine collection. Ewes were housed in individual 1 × 1. 5 -m pens with plastic coated <b>grate</b> <b>flooring</b> and were re-randomized to different treatments each period such that ewes were not offered the same treatment in any period. In general, intake and digestibility measurements were not affected (P ≥ 0. 15) by wrap type. Maximum digestible DM and DOMI were from silage wrapped the day following baling (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Correlations between fermentation measurements with intake and digestibility were not strong (r 2 3 ̆c 0. 42) however lactic concentrations expressed a greater correlation value (r 2 = 0. 14) with both DDMI and DOMI compared to other fermentation characteristics. Therefore, wrapping silage beyond 1 day after baling can have detrimental effects on energy status in gestating ewes and desirable fermentation should also result in greater intake of digestible dry and organic matter, and lactic acid concentration was not the best predictor of DDMI and DOMI in sheep...|$|R
60|$|The scene now {{represents}} {{a room of}} ten feet square, the floor of which is sunk a yard or two {{below the level of}} the ground; the walls are covered with a dirty and crumbling plaster, on which appear a crowd of ill-favored and lugubrious faces done in charcoal, and the autographs and poetical attempts of a long succession of debtors and petty criminals. Other features of the apartment are a deep fireplace (superfluous in the sultriness of the summer's day), a door of hard-hearted oak, and a narrow window high in the wall,--where the glass has long been broken, while the iron bars retain all their original strength. Through this opening come the sound of passing footsteps in the public street, and the voices of children at play. The furniture consists of a bed, or rather an old sack of barley straw, thrown down in the corner farthest from the door, and a chair and table, both aged and infirm, and leaning {{against the side of the}} room, besides lending a friendly support to each other. The atmosphere is stifled and of an ill smell, as if it had been kept close prisoner for half a century, and had lost all its pure and elastic nature by feeding the tainted breath of the vicious and the sighs of the unfortunate. Such is the present abode of the man of medicine and politics, and his own appearance forms no contrast to the accompaniments. His wig is unpowdered, out of curl, and put on awry; the dust of many weeks has worked its way into the web of his coat and small-clothes, and his knees and elbows peep forth to ask why they are so ill clad; his stockings are ungartered, his shoes down at the heel, his waistcoat is without a button, and discloses a shirt as dingy as the remnant of snow in a showery April day. His shoulders have become rounder, and his whole person is more bent and drawn together, since we last saw him, and his face has exchanged the glory of wit and humor for a sheepish dulness. At intervals, the Doctor walks the room, with an irregular and shuffling pace; anon, he throws himself flat on the sack of barley straw, muttering very reprehensible expressions between his teeth; then again he starts to his feet, and journeying from corner to corner, finally sinks into the chair, forgetful of its three-legged infirmity till it lets him down upon the <b>floor.</b> The <b>grated</b> window, his only medium of intercourse with the world, serves but to admit additional vexations. Every few moments the steps of the passengers are heard to pause, and some well-known face appears in the free sunshine behind the iron bars, brimful of mirth and drollery, the owner whereof stands on tiptoe to tickle poor Dr. Bullivant with a stinging sarcasm. Then laugh the little boys around the prison door, and the wag goes chuckling away. The apothecary would fain retaliate, but all his quips and repartees, and sharp and facetious fancies, once so abundant, seem to have been transferred from himself to the sluggish brains of his enemies. While endeavoring to condense his whole intellect into one venomous point, in readiness for the next assailant, he is interrupted by the entrance of the turnkey with the prison fare of Indian bread and water. With these dainties we leave him.|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} {{experiment was}} conducted to compare wheat and corn as energy sources and {{to determine if the}} performance of broiler chicks fed wheat or corn-based diets can be improved by supplementation with xylanase, protease or the two enzymes in combination. A total of 480, one-day old, male broiler chicks were {{randomly assigned to one of}} eight dietary treatments. Four of the diets were based on corn and soybean meal and four of the diets were based on wheat and soybean meal. The diets were either fed unsupplemented or supplemented with a xylanase enzyme (200 g/tonne), a protease enzyme (200 g/tonne) or the two enzymes in combination (125 g/tonne xylanase and 75 g/tonne protease). The chicks were housed in raised-floor battery cages with mesh <b>grate</b> <b>floors</b> overtop of fecal collection trays. There were five birds per pen and 12 replicate pens per treatment. Chromic oxide (0. 35 %) was added to all diets as a digestibility marker and was fed throughout the 21 -day experimental period. During the final three days of the experiment, feces were collected from each pen. There were no significant differences in weight gain (P= 0. 17) or feed intake (P= 0. 78) between broilers fed diets based on wheat or corn. Feed conversion was modestly improved for birds fed wheat compared with corn-based diets (P= 0. 09). Enzyme treatment had no significant effects on body weight gain (P= 0. 26). Feed intake was lower (P= 0. 06) for birds fed the enzymes in combination compared with the other three treatments. Feed conversion was improved (P= 0. 06) for birds fed protease either alone or in combination with xylanase. Birds fed wheat-based diets had significantly higher digestibility coefficients for dry matter (P= 0. 03) and energy (P= 0. 05) than birds fed corn-based diets. Nitrogen retention was unaffected by choice of cereal grain (P= 0. 26). There were no significant effects on dry matter digestibility (P= 0. 82), energy digestibility (P= 0. 61) or nitrogen retention (P= 0. 91) due to enzyme supplementation. In conclusion, the results of this experiment indicate that both corn and wheat can be successfully utilized in broiler diets. Supplementation with xylanase or protease produced modest improvements in performance with feed conversion being enhanced for the wheat-based diets. When the enzymes were fed in combination, there was some synergy as feed conversion was significantly enhanced for the wheat-based diets...|$|R
40|$|In {{my thesis}} I {{deal with a}} {{possible}} relation between the cots in nurseries and {{the increasing number of}} children with a poor posture. The aim is to map the condition of these cots and {{to determine the extent to}} which they sag if loaded. For my research I chose České Budějovice region, particularly two nurseries in České Budějovice and one nursery in Blatná. The theoretical part describes the development and function of the musculoskeletal system in the period from birth to 6 years of age and also depicts the growth of a preschool child's body. One of the chapters is devoted to the physical activity, which is an important instrument in the prevention of the improper organism development. Also, I describe the anatomical changes caused by the poor posture. An important part of the preschool child's daily program is the afternoon rest when children have to stay in beds. In my work I focus on the case of plastic beds where the standards are still very benevolent, although it is problematic.. The practical part consists of an objective measurement of the beds as well as data acquisition and its analysis with using of questionnaires. The research included 70 beds at three nurseries that have many years of experience with the plastic beds. Data were subsequently statistically evaluated. In my measurements, I was looking at the distance between the <b>floor</b> and the <b>grate</b> of the bed and how it changes without and with the load (the degree of sag). I registered the presence or absence of the mattress as well as the age of the bed, its manufacturer, storage of the beds and how they are handled in general. The collected data were used to confirm the original hypothesis: "The cots at the nurseries do not provide firm back support for children. " To evaluate this hypothesis, the T test was used to calculate the statistical significance of sagging of the beds. The beds fitted into the range that has been designated by the recommended requirements for a solid back support. The null hypothesis is therefore not valid. The second hypothesis was evaluated using quantitative method of questionnaires. The questionnaires were completed by 154 respondents. This group was made up of parents of children from the three nurseries. The results showed that 98 % of children of the questioned parents spend the afternoon rest time at the nursery in the bed. Statistical evaluation of the second hypothesis of the chi -square test confirmed: "More than two-thirds of the preschool children have no subjective symptoms related to the back pain. " Even though statistically I cannot establish a link between the poor posture of children and the quality of the cots at nurseries, I came out with the finding that at two of the three nurseries they do not use mattresses, which leads to the greater degree of sag and also the sufficient thermal isolation is not provided. In the research, the children already diagnosed with the poor posture did occur; therefore it is necessary to look for other causes of their orthopedic problems. It should be mentioned that the pediatricians may improve the condition of children by the proper examination of the musculoskeletal system and not underestimating of the rehabilitative care. The system also includes professionals in the sphere of the protection of public health, who play the important role not only as the controllers, but mainly as the advisors...|$|R
