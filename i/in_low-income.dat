5|$|The {{eruption}} {{was used}} as an example for psychiatric recuperation after natural disasters by Robert Desjarlais and Leon Eisenberg in their work World Mental Health: Problems and Priorities <b>in</b> <b>Low-Income</b> Countries. The authors were concerned that only initial treatment for the survivors' psychological trauma was conducted. One study showed that the victims of the eruption suffered from anxiety and depression, which can lead to alcohol abuse, marital problems and other social issues.|$|E

5|$|New {{state laws}} prohibiting fast food {{restaurants}} <b>in</b> <b>low-income</b> neighborhoods {{result in the}} closure of all KFC eateries in Colorado, much {{to the dismay of}} Cartman, who is addicted to the food. When Randy Marsh learns that South Park's KFC outlet is now a medical marijuana dispensary, he attempts to give himself cancer so he can get a doctor's referral for marijuana after first gaining {{a clean bill of health}} from his doctor since he had assumed permits are given to the healthy. By irradiating his groin with a microwave oven, Randy successfully gives himself testicular cancer, making his testicles so large that he has to use a wheelbarrow to carry them. Randy obtains his medical referral and starts smoking marijuana regularly. Meanwhile, his testicles continue to grow to the point that he uses them as a space hopper for movement. Randy finds that larger testicles are attractive to women, including his wife, Sharon Marsh, so he encourages his friends to also get testicular cancer. The local doctor, unaware of the men's self-irradiation, becomes convinced that a recent change in South Park is responsible for the cancer outbreak.|$|E
5|$|Population {{studies from}} the mid-20th century onwards show topical {{fluoride}} reduces dental caries. This was first {{attributed to the}} conversion of tooth enamel hydroxyapatite into the more durable fluorapatite, but studies on pre-fluoridated teeth refuted this hypothesis, and current theories involve fluoride aiding enamel growth in small caries. After studies of children in areas where fluoride was naturally present in drinking water, controlled public water supply fluoridation to fight tooth decay began in the 1940s and is now applied to water supplying 6 percent of the global population, including two-thirds of Americans. Reviews of the scholarly literature in 2000 and 2007 associated water fluoridation with a significant reduction of tooth decay in children. Despite such endorsements and evidence of no adverse effects other than mostly benign dental fluorosis, opposition still exists on ethical and safety grounds. The benefits of fluoridation have lessened, possibly due to other fluoride sources, but are still measurable <b>in</b> <b>low-income</b> groups. Sodium monofluorophosphate and sometimes sodium or tin(II) fluoride are often found in fluoride toothpastes, first introduced in the U.S. in 1955 and now ubiquitous in developed countries, alongside fluoridated mouthwashes, gels, foams, and varnishes.|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{neighborhood}} effect {{studies have}} reported on {{the negative consequences of}} living in disadvantaged neighborhoods for various employment outcomes, such as the duration of welfare dependence and level of income. One hypothesis for explaining this relationship is the social isolation hypothesis, which assumes that <b>low-income</b> residents <b>in</b> disadvantaged neighborhoods are worse off than their counterparts in mixed neighborhoods because they rely on other disadvantaged neighbors to find work. These ideas are addressed by comparing survey data on social resources in the social networks of residents <b>in</b> a <b>low-income</b> neighborhood and a socioeconomically mixed neighborhood in the Dutch city of The Hague. Findings show that living <b>in</b> a <b>low-income</b> neighborhood influences labor market participation indirectly by limiting residents' access to job information. However, differences in access to job information cannot be explained by the high degree of neighborhood orientation in the social networks of residents <b>in</b> the <b>low-income</b> neighborhood...|$|R

40|$|Technology use <b>in</b> high-minority, <b>low-income</b> {{middle school}} ELA {{classrooms}} {{is defined by}} traditional instructional practices (Applebee 2 ̆ 6 Langer, 2013; Attewell, 2001; Boser, 2013; Cuban, 2001; Lankshear 2 ̆ 6 Knobel, 2008), barriers to access (O’Dwyer et al., 2005; Purcell et al., 2013; Warschauer 2 ̆ 6 Matuchniak, 2010), and inequalities in use (Banister 2 ̆ 6 Reinhart, 2011; Beers, 2004; Gorski, 2009; Makinen, 2006; Powell, 2007; Reinhart et al., 2011; Dijk, 2003, 2006; Warschauer et al., 2004). This characterization, or grand narrative, of technology use is echoed and challenged by this narrative inquiry. Here the stories of two ELA teachers frequently using technology in instruction and working <b>in</b> a high-minority, <b>low-income</b> middle school are examined, guided by the following research puzzle: What might I learn about teaching with technology from two middle school ELA teachers utilizing technology <b>in</b> a high-minority, <b>low-income</b> school? <b>In</b> what ways might participants’ stories mirror or differ from the grand narrative of technology use <b>in</b> high-minority, <b>low-income</b> middle schools? <b>In</b> what ways might this inquiry expand general knowledge of technology use <b>in</b> high-minority, <b>low-income,</b> middle-level classrooms? The resulting narratives are considered in terms of culturally responsive teaching (Delpit, 1994, 1995; Gay, 2000; Irvine, 2002; 2003; Ladson-Billings, 2006), digital literacy (Gilster, 1997; Knobel 2 ̆ 6 Lankshear, 2006; Martin, 2008), and stage-environment fit theory (Eccles 2 ̆ 6 Midgely, 1989; Eccles et al., 1993; Eccles 2 ̆ 6 Roeser, 2011). Findings from this inquiry suggest technology increases engagement and is a distraction, technology makes teaching easier, and barriers hinder technology use...|$|R
