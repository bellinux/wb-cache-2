5|$|Following the 2002 {{deterioration}} of his health, al-Jamri's {{position as a}} political and religious leader of Bahrain's Shia opposition {{was taken over by}} his lifelong friend, Ayatollah Isa Qassim. Qassim was less revolutionary than al-Jamri, having opposed the 1992 and 1994 petitions, but his views were kept private, in part as a sign of respect for al-Jamri. Al-Jamri's role as leader of the opposition remained <b>empty,</b> <b>as</b> the opposition became fragmented.|$|E
5|$|In 350 BCE, Greek philosopher Aristotle {{suggested}} that nature abhors a vacuum, a principle that {{became known as}} the horror vacui. This concept built upon a 5th-century BCE ontological argument by the Greek philosopher Parmenides, who denied the possible existence of a void in space. Based on this idea that a vacuum could not exist, in the West it was widely held for many centuries that space could not be <b>empty.</b> <b>As</b> late as the 17th century, the French philosopher René Descartes argued that the entirety of space must be filled.|$|E
5|$|The {{defenders}} in {{the cattle}} pen retreated into the horse corral. After discharging their weapons, the {{small band of}} Texians scrambled over the low wall, circled behind the church and raced on foot for the east prairie, which appeared <b>empty.</b> <b>As</b> the Mexican cavalry advanced on the group, Almaron Dickinson and his artillery crew turned a cannon around and fired into the cavalry, probably inflicting casualties. Nevertheless, all of the escaping Texians were killed.|$|E

5|$|They are an {{essential}} part of the most impressive and famous of the frescoes, the Creation of Adam. Adam gazes at God. God looks directly at Adam. And under God's protective arm, Eve turns her eyes sideways in a look of admiration for her husband-to-be. Again and again, Michelangelo painted telling gazes into the faces of his characters. The eye sockets of the family in the Zorobabel lunette are <b>empty</b> <b>as</b> are the eyes of the man in the Aminadab lunette, but the removal that has caused the most distress to the critics are the eyes of the little figure in green and white who once looked out of the gloom above the lunette of Jesse.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs and {{his team}} {{eventually}} find and arrest Dom, Mia, Brian, and Vince. While transporting them to the airport for extradition to the United States, the convoy is attacked by Reyes' men, who kill Hobbs' team. Hobbs and Elena are saved by Dom, Brian, Mia, and Vince as they fight back and escape, but Vince is shot {{in the process and}} dies. Wanting to avenge his murdered team, Hobbs and Elena agree to help with the heist. The gang breaks into the police station and tear the vault holding Reyes' money from the building using their cars, dragging it through the city. After an extensive police chase, Dom makes Brian continue without him while he attacks the police and the pursuing Reyes, using the vault attached to his car to smash their vehicles. Brian returns and kills Zizi while Reyes is badly injured by Dom's assault. Hobbs arrives on the scene and executes Reyes to avenge his team. Though Hobbs refuses to let Dom and Brian go free, he gives them a 24-hour head start to escape on the condition they leave the vault as it is. However, the vault is <b>empty</b> <b>as</b> it had been switched during the chase. After splitting the cash (Vince's share is given to his family), they go their separate ways.|$|E
5|$|In South Africa {{cylinders}} may {{be filled}} {{for commercial purposes}} by {{a person who is}} competent {{in the use of the}} filling equipment to be used, who knows the relevant sections of the applicable standards and regulations, and has written permission from the owner of the cylinder to fill it. The cylinder must be in test and suitable for the gas to be filled, and the cylinder may not be filled above the developed pressure for the temperature reached when it is filled. An external inspection of the cylinder must be made, and specified details of the cylinder and fill must be recorded. If the fill is of a gas other than air, the analysis of the completed fill must be recorded by the filler and signed by the customer. If the residual pressure in a cylinder presented for filling does not produce a reasonably strong flow of gas from the valve when opened the filler may refuse to fill the cylinder unless an acceptable reason is given for it being <b>empty,</b> <b>as</b> there is no way for the filler to check if it has been contaminated.|$|E
25|$|Water was a {{precious}} resource, spent {{each time a}} lock was <b>emptied</b> <b>as</b> a boat changed level. Steam pumps were employed at many flights of locks to pump water back to a higher level, for example, the Smethwick Engine.|$|R
50|$|The 1989-1996 Liberian civil war, {{which was}} one of Africa's bloodiest, claimed the lives of more than 200,000 Liberians and further {{displaced}} a million others into refugee camps in neighboring countries. Entire villages were <b>emptied</b> <b>as</b> people fled. Child soldiers committed atrocities, raping and murdering people of all ages.|$|R

25|$|A {{review in}} Al-Modon said that Israel is <b>empty</b> <b>as</b> {{the book is}} empty, that the book is part of {{continuing}} Zionist methodology of claiming that Palestine is a land without a people, the same methodology that led the Zionists to steal the Palestinian cuisine and claim world-wide that hummus and falafel are Israeli inventions.|$|E
25|$|On the second-half kickoff, San Francisco {{recovered}} a surprise onside kick. The drive came up <b>empty,</b> <b>as</b> {{they were forced}} to punt. On Tampa Bay's next possession, however, Luke McCown (who had taken over for the benched Garcia) fumbled and the 49ers {{recovered a}}t the 14-yard line. In four plays, San Francisco scored a touchdown.|$|E
25|$|Midway {{through the}} third quarter, Matt Ryan {{completed}} {{a pass to}} Jason Rader, who ran for the endzone. Before he crossed the goal line, however, Jermaine Phillips punched the ball from his grasp, and it was recovered in the endzone by Tampa Bay. The Buccaneers' ensuing possession, however, came up <b>empty,</b> <b>as</b> Griese himself was intercepted past midfield.|$|E

[...] The room {{promptly}} <b>emptied</b> <b>as</b> the Pentagon press corps rushed to break the news.|$|R
50|$|Occasionally, {{gastroesophageal}} reflux (GERD) may {{be associated}} with delayed gastric emptying of solids, but clear liquids are not affected. Raised intra-abdominal pressure (e.g. in pregnancy or obesity) predisposes to regurgitation. Certain drugs such as opiates can cause marked delays in gastric <b>emptying,</b> <b>as</b> can trauma, which can be determined by certain indicators such as normal bowel sounds and patient hunger.|$|R
25|$|For n = 0 (or in fact n < 0) the {{projective}} space of K0 is <b>empty,</b> <b>as</b> {{there are no}} 1-dimensional subspaces of a 0-dimensional space. Thus, PGL(0, K) is the trivial group, consisting of the unique empty map from the empty set to itself. Further, the action of scalars on a 0-dimensional space is trivial, so the map K* → GL(0, K) is trivial, rather than an inclusion {{as it is in}} higher dimensions.|$|E
25|$|The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt {{was created}} with the REDengine 3, CD Projekt RED's {{proprietary}} game engine designed for nonlinear role-playing video games set in open world environments, {{aided by the}} PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles and prepared for use in October 2014. The first play-through indicated to the developers that the open world, despite its content and generation around the quests, seemed <b>empty.</b> <b>As</b> a solution, they added points of interest. The game had 5,000 bugs that December, which (with a launch date of February 2015) necessitated its postponement.|$|E
25|$|Eilat Airport was {{established}} in 1949, when most of what would later be Eilat was <b>empty.</b> <b>As</b> the city developed, {{much of it was}} built around the airport. In the 1994 Peace Agreement between Israel and Jordan it was decided that operations would be transferred from Eilat Airport to Aqaba Airport. The original plan was to rename Aqaba Airport as Aqaba–Eilat Peace International Airport. The agreement was never carried out, and an agreement between the two countries in March 1997, stipulated that domestic flights would continue to use Eilat Airport, whilst no further action to move international flights took place.|$|E

60|$|Ray {{was smoking}} his {{customary}} enormous pipe, which he deliberately <b>emptied</b> <b>as</b> Lady Angela and I approached. The {{sight of him}} and the significance of his wounds reduced me {{to a state of}} astonishment which could find no outlet in words. I simply stood and stared at him. Lady Angela, however, after her first exclamation of surprise, went up and greeted him.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>empty</b> set serves <b>as</b> {{the initial}} object in Set with <b>empty</b> {{functions}} <b>as</b> morphisms. Every singleton is a terminal object, with the functions mapping {{all elements of}} the source sets to the single target element as morphisms. There are thus no zero objects in Set.|$|R
25|$|Upon his election, {{he found}} the {{government}} coffers <b>empty,</b> <b>as</b> the state had exhausted itself {{in an attempt to}} recover from overspending on internal improvements during the 1830s. During his term, the government began to recover from the losses of the internal improvements. The Bigger administration had overseen a large reduction in the state's debt, but the government was still unable to make headway on the nine-million dollar debt that still existed. During his first term, he advocated major spending cuts, including large cuts in government employee wages. Those cuts, along with steadily improving state revenues, enabled the government to manage its debt during his first term in office.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the week, {{the joint}} {{committee}} was avail to canvass 131 COCs, except for two: one COC from the Bahamas had irregularities and was deferred, while the COC from Iran was found to be <b>empty.</b> <b>As</b> well, 26 countries and territories recorded zero votes for all positions namely: Guyana, Barbados, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Antigua and Barbuda, Cayman Islands, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Turks and Caicos Islands, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Nepal, Dominican Republic, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Tanzania, and Iran (as stated before). This led to Senator Aquilino Pimentel, Jr. to question the COMELEC on the reason for the dismal result of overseas Filipinos failing to vote.|$|E
25|$|On 11 December, the 7th Armoured Brigade {{was ordered}} out of reserve {{to relieve the}} 4th Armoured Brigade in the Buq Buq area, with orders to mop up. Large numbers of men and guns were {{captured}} and a patrol from the 7th Support Group entered Rabia to find it <b>empty,</b> <b>as</b> the 63rd Division Cirene had withdrawn from there and Sofafi overnight. An order to the 4th Armoured Brigade to cut them off, arrived too late and they retreated {{along the top of}} the escarpment and linked with the Italian garrison at Halfaya. The 4th Armoured Brigade, on top of the escarpment and the 7th Armoured Brigade on the coast, tried to pursue the Italians despite acute supply problems, exacerbated by the large number of prisoners (twenty times the number expected) and found it extremely difficult to advance.|$|E

25|$|As {{a general}} rule, ZFS {{allocate}} writes across vdevs {{based on the}} free space in each vdev. This ensures that vdevs which have proportionately less data already, are given more writes when new data is to be stored. This helps to ensure that as the pool becomes more used, the situation does not develop that some vdevs become full, forcing writes to occur on {{a limited number of}} devices. It also means that when data is read (and reads are much more frequent than writes in most uses), different parts of the data can be read from as many disks as possible at the same time, giving much higher read performance. Therefore, as a general rule, pools and vdevs should be managed and new storage added, so that the situation does not arise that some vdevs in a pool are almost full and others almost <b>empty,</b> <b>as</b> this will make the pool less efficient.|$|E
25|$|The UNESCO Expert Working Group on Afghan {{cultural}} projects convened {{to discuss}} {{what to do about}} the two statues between 3–4 March 2011 in Paris. Researcher Erwin Emmerling of Technical University Munich announced he believed it would be possible to restore the smaller statue using an organic silicon compound. The Paris conference issued a list of 39 recommendations for the safeguarding of the Bamiyan site. These included leaving the larger Western niche <b>empty</b> <b>as</b> a monument to the destruction of the Buddhas, a feasibility study into the rebuilding of the Eastern Buddha, and the construction of a central museum and several smaller site museums. Work has since begun on restoring the Buddhas using the process of anastylosis, where original elements are combined with modern material. It is estimated that roughly half the pieces of the Buddhas can be put back together according to Bert Praxenthaler, a German art historian and sculptor involved in the restoration. The restoration of the caves and Buddhas has also involved training and employing local people as stone carvers. The project, which also aims to encourage tourism to the area, is being organised by UNESCO and the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS).|$|E
25|$|On 3 January 1836, Cooley led a large shipwrecking {{expedition}} {{from the}} settlement {{to free the}} Gil Blas, a ship that had beached the previous September; {{the scale of the}} operation required most of the settlement's able men. The following day, a group of 15 to 20 Seminoles invaded the Cooley house, killed Cooley's wife and children, scalped the children's tutor, and burned the house to the ground. Although the Indians did not attack any other families, the massacre triggered the departure of the white settlers from the area. During the second Seminole War, Major William Lauderdale led his Tennessee Volunteers into the area. In 1838, Lauderdale erected a fort on the New River {{at the site of the}} modern city of Fort Lauderdale (where SW 9th Avenue meets SW 4th Court). Lauderdale left after one month, but his name remained. The Seminoles destroyed the fort a few months later. Two more forts were built sequentially, each closer to the ocean. After the end of the Second Seminole War in 1842, the fort was abandoned, and the area remained largely <b>empty,</b> <b>as</b> the remaining Seminoles withdrew to Pine Island, and only a handful of settlers were known to live in all of what eventually became Broward County. While the area was technically a part of the Confederacy during the US Civil War, the only known white settlers in the area during the war was pro-unionist Isaiah Hall and his family, who had been run out of Miami by pro-confederacy sympathizers in 1863, and settled on the New River.|$|E
