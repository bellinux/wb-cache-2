5000|$|Oligocentria pinalensis, the Arizona prominent, is a moth of the Notodontidae family. It is {{only found}} within the Pinal Mountains of central Arizona. Due to its {{extremely}} limited known range, Oligocentria pinalensis is at {{a high risk of}} becoming extinct from isolated events, such as a forest fire. There is not enough current population data to make a full conclusion of its present status. Although it has been listed by the NatureServe conservation status as [...] "GH" [...] or possibly extinct, <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>listing</b> of status was 2002. The species was first described by F.H. Benjamin, a pan-pacific entomologist, in a publication from 1932.|$|E

The north aspect has a porch to the right with a round arch to the door above which is a carving of Saint George slaying the dragon. To the left are the transept and chancel with arched windows. The south aspect is similar but without a porch. The east aspect has a triple round-headed window and pilaster buttresses similar to those on the west aspect.|$|E

40|$|In Indonesia stock market, LQ 45 is {{regarded}} as one of the main indices that attracts investor’s attention to depict the overall stock market. The stock listed in LQ 45 is always changing on 6 -month basis based on the criteria regulated by PT Bursa Efek Indonesia. Some investors that want to invest in liquid stocks, however, only look for the stock in the LQ 45 at the moment they want to invest. In this matter, the fluctuation of transaction can happen and affect the price of the stocks over time. It is hypothesized that listing on LQ 45 have a higher price because of lower risk implied on the stocks and attract more demand in the stock. The hypothesis for delisting on LQ 45 is conversely with the listing. This research is bounded by the time of stocks listing and delisting, which consists of stocks listed in February 2015 to July 2015, and also stocks delisted in the same period. To analyze the data, time series method is used. The price analyzed is one year before effective <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>listing</b> or delisting, and one year after the effective <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>listing</b> or delisting. Based on selected stocks that meet the criteria, listing of the stocks in LQ 45 shows a not significant price increase compared to the pre-listing period. On the delisted stocks, the result is significant price drop, which put higher risk into delisted stocks. The conclusion is LQ 45 index doesn’t make the price of a stock increase by some margin but once the stock came out of the index, the price will go down. In short, it is crucial to keep an eye on the LQ 45 index changes because it can gives insight for investor to make the trading timing right.

40|$|The present {{work has}} great {{importance}} for the economic and financial area {{due to the fact}} that targets the relevance of the financial indicators in anticipation of the stock variation. The aim is to measure the correlation, the type and intensity, between the variation of stock market profitability and the profitability of the securities traded by banks in Romania, listed on the BSE.

40|$|This {{paper has}} {{examined}} the Samuelson’s hypothesis which states that the price volatility increases as the contract nears its maturity. It has also examined the BCSS hypothesis which provides that negative covariance between the spot price and net cost of carry explains the maturity effect. The study {{has examined the}}se hypotheses on the data for wheat and pepper futures contract traded at NCDEX from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>listing</b> of the contract to 31 st March 2007 and the maturity effect has been examined for each contract individually. The study has indicated that maturity effect is present in around 45 per cent of the wheat and pepper contracts. Evidence supporting the BCSS hypothesis is present more strongly {{in the case of}} wheat as compared to pepper and 79 per cent of the contracts having maturity effect have depicted negative covariance in the case of wheat. Thus, it can be concluded that maturity effect is present and it is explained to a large extent by the negative co-variance between spot price and net carry cost. The study has observed that there is further scope for research in this area in relation to other agricultural commodities and also metals. Further studies can also be undertaken to find the informational efficiency and the reaction of informational flow to identify the reasons for {{the presence or absence of}} maturity effect.

40|$|ABSTRACTObjectiveTimely {{access to}} {{necessary}} medicines that Australians need {{is one of}} the four pillars of the Australian Government's National Medicines Policy. We were interested to determine whether there was a change in the time taken for medicines to be listed once recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC). MethodsDescriptive statistics were used to show the pattern of recommendations for PBAC meetings from 1999 to 2003. For successful recommendations, we developed a linear regression model to analyze the time to list from the PBAC meeting to <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>listing</b> (time to list). The model determined whether this time had changed over the 4 -year period, and the reasons for any changes. ResultsThe PBAC made 307 positive recommendations at its 17 meetings over the study period. Ninety percent resulted in a Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) listing on or before April 1, 2005. Eighty-two percent of the recommendations made in 1999 and 2000 resulted in early or on-time listings. In 2001, 2002, and 2003, the comparable proportions were 67 %, 68 %, and 75 %. Mean times to list for the years from 1999 to 2003 were similar (approximately 23 weeks), except in 2001 where it was 30 weeks. ConclusionsOver the study period, 90 % of all PBAC recommendations resulted in a PBS listing. In 2001 there was a statistically significant increase in the mean time to list. In addition, it appears that recommendations for new listings and new indications (medicines that are likely to result in substantial Government expenditure) were associated with a longer time to list...|$|E

40|$|Background. This study {{aimed to}} assess the impact of wait times on patient {{survival}} following liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a single donor service area. Patients and methods. Patients listed in the New England Organ Bank (NEOB) from 1996 to 2005 for liver transplantation with a diagnosis of HCC were identified from the United Network for Organ Sharing database. The following data were extracted: <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>listing,</b> date removed from the wait list, indication for wait list removal, patient death and date of last known follow-up. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were calculated from the time of listing for transplant (intention to treat liver transplant survival, ITT OLT) and compared to those calculated from the date of transplant (liver transplant, OLT). Results. There were 63 new registrations to the transplant list during the study period. Sixty-one patients were removed from the waiting list: transplanted 41 (65 %), death seven (11 %), candidate condition deteriorated/too sick to transplant eight (13 %), medically unsuitable one (2 %), other one (2 %), transferred to another center two (3 %), and transplanted at another center one (2 %). Three-year survival following liver transplantation for primary liver cancer was 85 %. When the results were analyzed using an intention to treat analysis there was a 10 – 20 % decrease in survival rate at every time point due to wait list drop-out. Conclusion. Wait list drop-out adversely affects liver transplant survival in transplant centers served by the NEOB. These data should be considered when recommending transplant versus resection as first line therapy for stage I or II HCC in our region...|$|E
