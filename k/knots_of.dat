5|$|Sailor Brian Hancock {{encountered}} Hurricane Lili {{during the}} Route of Discovery yacht race from Benalmádena, Spain to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.Tropical Storm Lili was traveling at around 18 knots {{along the same}} path as the race fleet and was starting to pick off the slower boats. Astern of us we were getting reports of gale force winds, ripped sails and some damage all the while Lili gained in strength. By our calculation we would get to the Bahamas before the storm did, but {{the problem was that}} the Bahamas were not our final destination. We had to round San Salvador and then sail just under 500 miles back toward the east, well southeast to be exact. We rounded San Salvador and sailed slap bang into the teeth of a ferocious storm. Hurricane Lili was packing around 70 to 80 <b>knots</b> <b>of</b> wind and we hove to to ride it out. I remember feeling exhilarated by it all. It helps to be a little naive and dumb but that’s how you are when you are in your 20’s.|$|E

25|$|A slower {{speed of}} 19 knots is designed, {{compared}} to the 23–26 <b>knots</b> <b>of</b> similar ships.

25|$|Militants {{published}} a newspaper, The Waterfront Worker, {{which focused on}} longshoremen's most pressing demands: more men on each gang, lighter loads and an independent union. While {{a number of the}} individuals in this group were Communist Party members, the group as a whole was independent of the party: although it criticized the International Seamen's Union (ISU) as weak and the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA), which had its base on the East Coast, as corrupt, it did not embrace the MWIU, but called instead for creation of small <b>knots</b> <b>of</b> activists at each port to serve as {{the first step in a}} slow, careful movement to unionize the industry.|$|E
25|$|The Curtiss C-46 Commando {{began to}} fly India-China {{missions}} in May 1943. The C-46 {{was a large}} twin-engine aircraft capable of flying faster and higher than any previous medium-range cargo aircraft, and could carry heavier loads than either the C-47 or the C-87, albeit at two and one half times the unit cost for a C-47. With the C-46, airlift tonnage increased significantly, surpassing objectives with 12,594 tons in December 1943. Loads continued to increase throughout 1944 and 1945, reaching an all-time maximum tonnage in July 1945. Performance of the Commando was enhanced when camouflage paint, standard on all AAF aircraft until February 1944, was removed to reduce weight and provide five extra <b>knots</b> <b>of</b> speed.|$|E

25|$|Weaving {{normally}} begins {{from the}} bottom of the loom, by passing a number of wefts through the warps to form a base to start from. <b>Knots</b> <b>of</b> dyed wool, cotton or silk threads are then tied in rows around consecutive sets of adjacent warps. As more rows are tied to the foundation, these knots become the pile of the rug. Between each row of knots, one or more shots of weft are passed to keep the knots fixed. The wefts are then beaten down by a comb-like instrument, the comb beater, to further compact and secure the newly-woven row. Depending on the fineness of the weave, the quality of the materials and the expertise of the weavers, the knot count of a handmade rug can vary anywhere from 16 to 800 knots per square inch.|$|E
25|$|The {{propulsion}} {{system of the}} RN ships will have a gas turbine direct drive and four high speed diesel generators driving two electric motors in a combined diesel-electric or gas (CODLOG) configuration. In 2012 Rolls Royce repackaged the MT30 used in the Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers {{so that it would}} fit into smaller ships. The MT30 will be used in the Type 26. BAE Systems have suggested that some customers will install gas turbine engines and others will prefer to sacrifice 2–3 <b>knots</b> <b>of</b> speed by choosing cheaper diesel engines. The CODLOG configuration for propulsion is a simpler version of the Combined diesel-electric and gas (CODLAG) propulsion used on the Type 23 which this ship is to replace, and both of the Global Combat Ship's design contemporaries – the Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier and the Type 45 destroyer – use integrated electric propulsion (IEP).|$|E
25|$|Marchand {{served under}} Ney again in Marshal André Masséna's third {{invasion}} of Portugal in 1810. He fought at the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo from 26 April ro 9 July 1810 and the Siege of Almeida from 25 July to 27 August. On 15 September, Marchand's 1st Division consisted of Maucune's 1st Brigade, the 6th Light and 69th Line, and Marcognet's 2nd Brigade, the 39th and 76th Line. There were 6,457 men and 214 {{officers in the}} division. At the Battle of Bussaco on 27 September, Louis Henri Loison's division led the attack up the main road toward to top of the ridge. Fighting its way through <b>knots</b> <b>of</b> British and Portuguese skirmishers, it was met at the crest by British infantry and artillery and defeated. Too late to support Loison, one of Marchand's brigades neared {{the top of the}} ridge. Because of hostile artillery fire it strayed {{to the left of the}} road. Marchand's attack was beaten by Denis Pack's Portuguese brigade. His division suffered the loss of 1,173 men while Loison's division sustained 1,252 casualties.|$|E

500|$|Despite the controversy, Thích Nhất Hạnh again {{returned}} to Vietnam in 2007, while two senior {{officials of the}} banned Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV) remained under house arrest.

Võ Văn Ái, {{a spokesman for the}} UBCV, said [...] "I believe Thích Nhất Hạnh's trip is manipulated by the Hanoi government to hide its repression of the Unified Buddhist Church and create a false impression of religious freedom in Vietnam." [...] The Plum Village Website states that the three goals of his 2007 trip back to Vietnam were to support new monastics in his Order; to organize and conduct [...] "Great Chanting Ceremonies" [...] intended to help heal remaining wounds from the Vietnam War; and to lead retreats for monastics and lay people.

500|$|Two more {{issues are}} {{addressed}} in the Sunday Herald article, {{but not in the}} Daily Mail article. The first is of the knots used to tie up Carol's body [...] the knots on Carol's body were mostly granny <b>knots,</b> <b>of</b> which {{there was no evidence that}} Gordon ever used [...] indeed during the trial he was specifically asked this, and he responded, [...] "I do not use granny knots". The granny knot is always a mistake, used by someone who should have used a reef knot; those learning knot-tying frequently make this mistake. Gordon Park, an experienced knot-tyer, would likely never use a granny knot, and their frequent appearance on the body of Carol is strong evidence that it was not Gordon who tied them. The article also claims that the evidence of knots was irrelevant anyway, as climbers and yachtsmen were so common in the area. The other piece of evidence related to another rock taken from the lakebed, which had supposedly come from the Parks' roof. However, the prosecution eventually admitted that Westmoreland green slate had been worked in the area for hundreds of years, and could have come from anywhere. The Herald also mentions the fact that the police files from the original missing persons inquiry into Carol Park had gone missing themselves, but does not draw any conclusions from this.|$|E
