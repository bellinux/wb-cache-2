25|$|Alfredsson {{was arguably}} Ottawa's {{best player in}} the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals, which the Senators {{ultimately}} lost to the Anaheim Ducks in a five-game series. In a controversial incident in game four, an Alfredsson slap shot hit Ducks captain Scott Niedermayer {{at the end of the}} second period, leading to speculation that Alfredsson intended to injure Niedermayer. Alfredsson dismissed the notion, saying that he had <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the clock to see if he had time to move in for a better shot, and then quickly fired in the heat of an important game.|$|E

60|$|She <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him and waited. Arnold, however, {{had stopped}} short.|$|E
60|$|Ursula crimsoned. Her {{girls were}} <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her, smirking their accusation.|$|R

60|$|Elma <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} a certain tinge of half-incredulous surprise.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Raggett started, and <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{somebody}} leaning {{from the}} window.|$|E
60|$|She merely <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> his entrance. Her {{eyes were}} still far away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Whom?" [...] said Mrs. Bunting, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{eyes that}} were {{suddenly}} eager, and then following their glance towards Chatteris.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a great charge," [...] {{said the}} Commander, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the {{wonderful}} tracery of steel outlined against {{the deep blue}} sky.|$|R
60|$|The dog now stopped barking, {{and stood}} looking <b>at</b> Pomona, {{occasionally}} <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> us. Pomona took {{not the slightest}} notice of him.|$|R
60|$|She <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} a winsome smile, glad to hear his words.|$|E
60|$|She {{seemed to}} {{recognise}} it, for at length she <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him sharply.|$|E
60|$|He <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her abrupt pause, and she {{was looking}} at the house.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Dix whistled softly and, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the tall, white-faced {{young man}} before him, pushed his cap back and {{scratched}} his head.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is, sir," [...] {{returned}} Mr. George, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{the great}} letters {{in which that}} inscription was painted on the whitewashed wall.|$|R
6000|$|... "Burke," [...] said Captain Horn, quickly, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the noon-day sun, [...] "put her {{out there}} near the wreckage, and take an observation." ...|$|R
60|$|As the workman {{passed through}} the little outer office Edith Hudson <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|E
60|$|She <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him shyly through wet lashes--as peeps the sun through April clouds.|$|E
60|$|Jims {{looked to}} see if she meant it; then <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the sky again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why," [...] said I, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> my companion, [...] "that {{was surely}} the bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're quite unfathomable," [...] she repeated, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{the windows}} of the house, a modern {{structure}} in the new part of the town.|$|R
6000|$|... "A journalist," [...] she repeated, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him. [...] "Yes! I {{might have}} guessed that. Are you {{a friend of}} Sir Julien Portel?" ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Wragg <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{the young}} {{fisherman}} towering above him, and eyed him disdainfully.|$|E
60|$|His {{companion}} made {{no immediate}} answer, {{but by and}} by she once more <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|E
60|$|She <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, {{her eyes}} {{abruptly}} and slightly moist, half with hurt, half with anger.|$|E
6000|$|... "And am I a new sensation?" [...] Maggie asked, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him innocently enough, {{but with}} a faint gleam of mockery in her eyes.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Somers: [...] "I'm so {{glad you}} don't mind the weather." [...] With {{her hand on the}} teapot, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Miss Bayly: [...] "And do you refuse too?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will surely}} {{go in and}} see Mrs. Esdaile," [...] she repeated, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him with eyes which had in them {{something}} between a challenge and a caress.|$|R
60|$|She {{read the}} title, and <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with a}} shade of {{interest}} in her face.|$|E
60|$|He <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her, {{and their}} eyes met, nor could he turn his head away again.|$|E
60|$|Nikasti looked {{downwards}} at {{the dress}} coat {{which he was}} carrying. Then he <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Von Schwerin.|$|E
6000|$|... "I--I'm 'most sure as she'll be {{here soon}} to call, sir. And--perhaps you oughtn't to--to go to--Thompson's," [...] stammered Hucks, <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{them with his}} bright, elusive smile.|$|R

6000|$|And {{followed}} by STEEL, he descends {{the steps and}} moves away. [...] Two policemen pass <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the broken glass. One of them [...] stops and makes a note.|$|R
