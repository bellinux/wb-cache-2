5|$|Despite strong {{evidence}} linking the gang to {{a spate of}} vehicle thefts along the A1 road, Ross is unable to persuade his superior, Sergeant Pearson (Arthur Rigby), to investigate the caf√©. He therefore pursues the matter on his own, confronting Diamond with his knowledge and forcing the gangster to bribe him in exchange for <b>his</b> <b>silence.</b> When Pearson learns of Ross' private investigation, he threatens the officer's job, causing tension between Ross and his wife Joan (Patricia Heneghan).|$|E
5|$|From 10 July 1925, {{until his}} death in 1969, Meher Baba was silent. He communicated first by using an {{alphabet}} board and later by unique hand gestures which were interpreted and spoken out by one of his mandali, usually by his disciple Eruch Jessawala. Meher Baba said that <b>his</b> <b>silence</b> was not undertaken as a spiritual exercise but solely in connection with his universal work.|$|E

5|$|Many {{commentators}} and cricketers deplored {{the use of}} Bodyline bowling. Some felt {{frustration that}} Woodfull had not publicly condemned the tactics, believing that <b>his</b> <b>silence</b> was interpreted as approval. Once his opinions were revealed by the leak, opponents of Bodyline felt publicly legitimised and expressed their opinions more freely. It also revealed deep and unaccustomed divisions between the teams which had been kept from view. The leak and subsequent events in the same match brought varied opinions from journalists and former players on Bodyline into the newspapers, both for and against Bodyline tactics.|$|E

5|$|As Secretary Upshur {{accelerated}} the secret treaty discussions, Mexican diplomats learned that US-Texas talks were taking place. Mexican {{minister to the}} U.S. Juan Almonte confronted Upshur with these reports, warning him that if Congress sanctioned a treaty of annexation, Mexico would break diplomatic ties and immediately declare war. Secretary Upshur evaded and dismissed the charges, and pressed forward with the negotiations. In tandem with moving forward with Texas diplomats, Upshur was secretly lobbying US Senators to support annexation, providing lawmakers with persuasive arguments linking Texas acquisition to national security and domestic peace. By early 1844, Upshur was able to assure Texas officials that 40 of the 52 members of the Senate were pledged to ratify the Tyler-Texas treaty, more than the two-thirds majority required for passage. Tyler, in his annual address to Congress in December 1843, maintained <b>his</b> <b>silence</b> on the secret treaty, {{so as not to}} damage relations with the wary Texas diplomats. Throughout, Tyler did his utmost to keep the negotiations secret, making no public reference to his administration's single-minded quest for Texas.|$|E

5|$|As {{the city}} prepares for the {{memorial}} service, Leslie and Ben are caught making {{out by a}} maintenance worker named George (Biff Yeager), so they send him home with a gift certificate in exchange for <b>his</b> <b>silence.</b> Unfortunately, George had the propane for Li'l Sebastian's eternal flame, which results in later confusion behind the scenes, that Leslie and Ben struggle to fix throughout the night. Jerry (Jim O'Heir) is sent to get propane for the flame but buys lighter fluid instead; this causes a huge fireball to shoot into the air when Ron lights it, which singes off his eyebrows, part of his mustache and hair. Leslie and Ben are relieved, however, when the crowd applauds in the belief the fireball was staged. Entertainment 720's show also proves to be a hit with the crowd, which makes Tom further contemplate quitting his job.|$|E
5|$|Casting English-speaking lead {{actors in}} Spaghetti Westerns was a growing {{practice}} {{because it was}} believed to allow international marketability. Marcello Mastroianni had conceived {{the idea of a}} mute gunfighter when he told Corbucci that he had always wanted to appear in a Western, but would have been held back by his inability to speak English. When Corbucci first met Jean-Louis Trintignant, who was hired for the leading role of the film by Les Films Corona after it was turned down by Franco Nero (who had previously played the title character of Django), he learned that Trintignant did not speak English either. To bypass the need for an English-speaking lead, Corbucci decided to turn Trintignant's character into a mute. At the time, Trintignant was known {{for his role in the}} critically acclaimed romantic drama A Man and a Woman, and is believed to have accepted the role in support of co-producer Robert Dorfmann, who was a friend of <b>his.</b> <b>Silence</b> was his only role in a Spaghetti Western.|$|E
5|$|In Salinas, Genevevo Salinas of Houston had voluntarily gone to {{a police}} station when {{officers}} asked him to accompany them {{to talk about the}} murder of two men. Salinas answered most of the officers' questions, but simply remained silent when they asked him whether shotgun casings found {{at the scene of the}} murders would match his gun. He shifted his feet, and otherwise acted nervously, but did not say anything. Later, at his trial, prosecutors told jurors that <b>his</b> <b>silence</b> in the face of that question showed that he was guilty, that he knew that the shotgun used to kill the victims was his. Salinas' lawyer wanted the Supreme Court to rule that the simple fact of silence during police questioning, when an individual was not under arrest, could not be used against that person at a criminal trial.|$|E

5|$|It is {{revealed}} that Mahone was being blackmailed by Paul Kellerman (Paul Adelstein), a Secret Service agent {{forced to work}} for the Company. Kellerman threatens to reveal that Mahone killed Shales, and forces him to kill all the escapees in exchange for <b>his</b> <b>silence.</b> Although hesitant, Mahone agrees when an operative of the Company, Agent Kim (Reggie Lee), threatens to murder his family. Mahone continues his hunt for the remaining six escapees but is betrayed and shot by Kellerman, who transfers his allegiance to the brothers. He survives and decides to stop chasing the escapees, but is forced to resume his search when his son is injured in a car accident orchestrated by one of Kim's agents. Before returning to work, he murders the agent who arranged the accident. Mahone returns to his FBI field office, where he is informed by Agent Wheeler (Jason Davis) that Internal Affairs is investigating him.|$|E
5|$|On {{an episode}} of Colt Cabana's Art of Wrestling podcast {{released}} in November 2014, Punk broke <b>his</b> <b>silence</b> regarding his exit from WWE. In a detailed interview, Punk {{said that he was}} suspended for two months after walking out on the company in January and that after the suspension ended, nobody from WWE contacted him. He also told that when he reached out to them for unpaid royalties, he was given a run-around by company executives until he was handed his termination papers and was fired by WWE on his wedding day in June 2014. The manner of firing was the last straw for Punk, stating that he would never return to WWE and that following a legal settlement with WWE, there would be no further working relationship between them. The settlement included Punk giving WWE permission to sell his remaining merchandise.|$|E
5|$|Sir Jonah Barrington {{was born}} in 1760 near Abbeyleix in the Queen's County (Co. Laois). He was first elected to Parliament as a member for Tuam in 1790. He lost this seat in 1798 and was elected as a member for Banagher in 1799. He voted against the Act of Union in 1801 {{and as a result}} he was {{deprived}} of his ¬£1,000 a year sinecure in the Customs House and this also stopped his further advancement. In 1809 he published, in five parts, the first volume of the Historic Memoirs of Ireland. It is thought that he was induced to delay the second volume ‚Äì the English government shrinking from the exposure of their conduct in carrying the Act of Union, and it was understood that to purchase <b>his</b> <b>silence</b> he was permitted to reside in France from about 1815.|$|E

5|$|Trevor is {{depicted}} as a sociopath in Grand Theft Auto V. He is relentless and easily kills without remorse. However, he is honest about everything and rarely shows hypocrisy, which he often points out in others. He appears to be very insecure about {{having grown up in}} Canada, and takes offence to people mocking his accent. Despite his sociopathic actions, Trevor is very emotional; he seems to care about people very close to him, and he can be truly loyal to them. These people include his mother, Ashley Butler, Patricia Madrazo, Maude, Michael De Santa and his children Tracey and Jimmy, Lamar Davis, Ron, Lester, Wade and Franklin Clinton. Nevertheless, the other characters regard Trevor as dangerously unstable; during the prologue, Michael leads Trevor into a trap where he is supposed to be shot and killed, and later implores Franklin to plead insanity if he is ever arrested with Trevor. It is implied that the knowledge and extent of Trevor's crimes, the belief that Trevor's depravity escalated without anyone to keep him in check and <b>his</b> <b>silence</b> on the matter all weigh heavily on Michael's conscience.|$|E
5|$|The land reforms {{brought about}} by the Ar√©valo {{administration}} threatened the interests of the landed elite, who sought a candidate who would be more amenable to their terms. They began to prop up Arana as a figure of resistance to Ar√©valo's reforms. The summer of 1949 saw intense political conflict in the councils of the Guatemalan military between supporters of Arana and those of √Årbenz, over the choice of Arana's successor. On July 16, 1949, Arana delivered an ultimatum to Ar√©valo, demanding the expulsion of all of √Årbenz's supporters from the cabinet and the military; he threatened a coup if his demands were not met. Ar√©valo informed √Årbenz and other progressive leaders of the ultimatum; all agreed that Arana should be exiled. Two days later, Ar√©valo and Arana had another meeting; on the way back, Arana's convoy was intercepted by a small force led by √Årbenz. A shootout ensued, killing three men, including Arana. Historian Piero Gleijeses stated that √Årbenz probably had orders to capture, rather than to kill, Arana. Arana's supporters in the military rose up in revolt, but they were leaderless, and by the next day the rebels asked for negotiations. The coup attempt left approximately 150 dead and 200 wounded. √Årbenz and a few other ministers suggested that the entire truth be made public; however, they were overruled by the majority of the cabinet, and Ar√©valo made a speech suggesting that Arana had been killed for refusing to lead a coup against the government. √Årbenz kept <b>his</b> <b>silence</b> over the death of Arana until 1968, refusing to speak out without first obtaining Ar√©valo's consent. He tried to persuade Ar√©valo to tell the entire story when the two met in Montevideo in the 1950s, during their exile: however, Ar√©valo was unwilling, and √Årbenz did not press his case.|$|E
