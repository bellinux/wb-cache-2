5|$|The {{doctrine}} <b>found</b> <b>its</b> {{origins in}} the failures of Marxism–Leninism in states like Poland, Hungary and East Germany, which were facing a declining standard of living contrasting with the prosperity of West Germany {{and the rest of}} Western Europe.|$|E
5|$|The humorous 2007 {{animated}} film Bee Movie used Jerry Seinfeld's first script and {{was his first}} work for children; he starred as a bee named Barry B. Benson, alongside Renée Zellweger. Critics <b>found</b> <b>its</b> premise awkward and its delivery tame.|$|E

5|$|According to Dutton, Sigourney Weaver {{was largely}} {{responsible}} for his casting. In the years leading up the production of Alien 3, she promised him {{a role in the}} third film. While he was working on Broadway in December 1990, Weaver phoned him that the studio approved his casting and wanted him to fly to London. Although Dutton liked Alien 3, he <b>found</b> <b>its</b> production tumultuous; director David Fincher encountered resistance from 20th Century Fox, and Pinewood Studios was in need of renovation.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 15th century, {{curvilinear}} perspective <b>found</b> <b>its</b> way into paintings by artists interested in image distortions. Jan van Eyck's 1434 Arnolfini Portrait contains a convex mirror with reflections {{of the people in}} the scene, while Parmigianino's Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror, c. 1523–1524, shows the artist's largely undistorted face at the centre, with a strongly curved background and artist's hand around the edge.|$|E
5|$|As {{the season}} progressed, however, the team quickly <b>found</b> <b>its</b> rhythm, beating ranked teams like Baylor, Notre Dame and Maryland, and {{showcasing}} a talented core of young players. Together with sophomore Katie Lou Samuelson and junior Kia Nurse, the only returning starters, the duo of sophomore Napheesa Collier and junior Gabby Williams quickly rose to national attention; even senior Saniya Chong, {{who had played}} few minutes in her first three seasons, showed great improvements, leading the nation in assists-to-turnovers ratio.|$|E

5|$|During this time, St. Anthony, on {{the east}} side, was {{separate}} from Minneapolis, on the west side. As a result of inferior management of the water power, St. Anthony <b>found</b> <b>its</b> manufacturing district declining. Some people and organizations started to talk about merging the two cities. A citizens' committee recommended merging the two cities in 1866, but a vote on this issue was rejected in 1867. Minneapolis incorporated as a city in 1867. The two cities found themselves competing with St. Paul, which had a larger population, the head of navigation of the Mississippi River, and more access to railroads.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Australian arm of KFC {{was accused}} of racial {{insensitivity}} over a television commercial showing an outnumbered white cricket fan handing out pieces of fried chicken to appease a dancing, drumming and singing group of black West Indies supporters. The clip <b>found</b> <b>its</b> way {{around the world on}} the internet, prompting stinging criticism in the United States where fried chicken remains closely associated with long-standing racist stereotypes about black people in the once segregated south.|$|E

5|$|In artistic terms, {{there was}} a revival in mosaic, and {{regional}} schools of architecture began producing many distinctive styles that drew {{on a range of}} cultural influences. During the 12th century, the Byzantines provided their model of early humanism as a renaissance of interest in classical authors. In Eustathius of Thessalonica, Byzantine humanism <b>found</b> <b>its</b> most characteristic expression. In philosophy, there was resurgence of classical learning not seen since the 7th century, characterised by {{a significant increase in the}} publication of commentaries on classical works. In addition, the first transmission of classical Greek knowledge to the West occurred during the Komnenian period.|$|E
5|$|Instead, {{under the}} novel {{conditions}} of attrition warfare, war pigeons in their traditional role as pigeon post saw a renaissance. Neubronner's mobile dovecote <b>found</b> <b>its</b> {{way to the}} Battle of Verdun, where it proved so advantageous that similar facilities were used {{on a larger scale}} in the Battle of the Somme. After the war, the War Ministry responded to Neubronner's inquiry to the effect that the use of pigeons in aerial photography had no military value and further experiments were not justified.|$|E

5|$|Karas won the Best Original Video at the 2006 Tokyo Anime Award competition, {{and most}} reviewers were {{impressed}} with the images produced by fusing 2D and 3D art techniques. The story presents themes on the conflicts between cultural traditions and modern society, {{and the relationship between}} people. Reviewers, however, <b>found</b> <b>its</b> presentation was too confusing to follow; several of them felt it worsened the show by detracting from the strength of its art.|$|E
5|$|On release, The Beatles {{received}} favourable {{reviews from}} the majority of music critics, but other commentators <b>found</b> <b>its</b> satirical songs unimportant and apolitical amid the turbulent political and social climate of 1968. The band and Martin have since debated whether the group should have released a single album instead. Nonetheless, The Beatles reached {{number one on the}} charts in both the United Kingdom and the United States and has since been viewed by some critics {{as one of the greatest}} albums of all time.|$|E
5|$|Police {{had found}} and arrested some {{suspects}} within 24 {{hours of the}} crime.

5|$|Released on August 21, 1943, {{the film}} failed to garner {{significant}} income {{at the box}} office and received mixed reviews from critics, who <b>found</b> <b>its</b> narrative incoherence a primary fault. It was later revealed that Robson and an editor, John Lockert, had removed four substantial scenes from the final cut, including an extended conclusion. In spite of its mixed reception, the film became a cult film in England, noted by critics for its homoerotic undertones.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} sequel's {{additional}} features and variety, while others <b>found</b> <b>its</b> gameplay unoriginal {{compared to the}} original and its contemporaries.

5|$|The 2009 season {{started with}} a sole win and a draw from the Crusaders' first five matches; this {{included}} a 6—0 loss to the Highlanders.

Both the Crusaders and Waratahs finished the season with 41 competition points, but the Crusaders advanced through to the semi-finals due to a greater 'points for and against' difference.|$|E
