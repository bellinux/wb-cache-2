500|$|At one point, Thompson {{was asked}} by the National Institute on Media and the Family to stop invoking the organization's name in his campaigns. NIMF {{president}} David Walsh felt Thompson cast the organization in a bad light whenever he brought up their name. [...] "Your commentary has included extreme hyperbole and your tactics have included personally attacking individuals for whom <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of respect," [...] Walsh said in an open letter to Thompson.|$|E

He's most comfortable with children, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> love for kids. He gives love and wants love in return, which is me. And he has that super power which lets him lift off and fly whenever he wants to get away from things on Earth, and I can identify with that. He and I are alike in many ways" ...|$|E
500|$|Of course, I haven't any {{voice to}} speak of, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> register, and Sullivan used to amuse himself by making me sing bass in one number of an opera and tenor in another. [...] In 'Ruddygore', Sir Arthur had engaged {{a man to}} play the servant, my menial, so to speak, who had an {{enormous}} bass voice, and who had {{to go down to}} the lower E flat. [...] Singularly enough, he could go down to G, and then he dropped out entirely, and I did the [...] below. [...] Generally the audience roared with laughter, and it absolutely brought down the house.|$|E

500|$|Books and {{characters}} in the series were inspired by books and films. For example, the character Slappy the Dummy {{was inspired by the}} literary classic The Adventures of Pinocchio. Some of Stine's ideas for the books also came from real life; Stine got the idea for the book The Haunted Mask after his son, Matt, had a Halloween mask that he had trouble getting off. Stine also uses his childhood fears to help him write his books. The author said, [...] "Luckily, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> memory. As I write a story, I can remember {{what it feels like to}} be afraid and panicky". Stine states that he often thinks of a title to a novel first, then lets the title lead him to a story.|$|E
500|$|Opinions differ as to {{how this}} came about but it {{is thought to have}} become popular in the 1950s when a version of the song was in the British charts—the line [...] "sometimes <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> notion to jump in the river and drown"—seemed to be {{particularly}} apt when Rovers lost as the Bristol Frome flows alongside the old Eastville ground. Another theory is that it was sung at a fireworks display at the Stadium the night before a Home game against Plymouth Argyle in the 1950s. During the game the following day, Rovers were winning quite comfortably and the few Argyle supporters present began to leave early prompting a chorus of [...] "Goodnight Argyle" [...] from the Rovers supporters—the tune stuck and Irene became the club song.|$|E
500|$|On December 17, 2013, LaBeouf {{released}} his short film Howard Cantour.com to the Internet; shortly thereafter, several bloggers noted its close similarity to Justin M. Damiano, a 2007 comic by Ghost World creator Dan Clowes. Wired journalist Graeme McMillan noted {{at least three}} similarities in their article, {{one of which was}} that the opening monologue for the short and the comic were identical. LaBeouf would later remove the film and claim that he did not intend to copy Clowes but was instead [...] "inspired" [...] by him and [...] "got lost in the creative process." [...] He followed this up with several apologies via Twitter writing, [...] "In my excitement and naiveté as an amateur filmmaker, I got lost in the creative process and neglected to follow proper accreditation", and [...] "I deeply regret the manner in which these events have unfolded and want @danielclowes to know that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> respect for his work". Clowes responded by saying [...] "The first I ever heard of the film was this morning when someone sent me a link. I've never spoken to or met Mr. LaBeouf ... I actually can't imagine what was going through his mind." [...] LaBeouf was criticized over his apology, with some sites such as The A.V. Club noting that the apology itself appeared to have been lifted from a 2010 post on Yahoo! Answers.|$|E

Schwarzenegger reacted to Trump’s latest remarks on January 2017: “Hey, Donald, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> idea. Why don’t we switch jobs?” he asked in an Instagram clip. “You take over TV because you’re such an expert in ratings, and I take over your job, and then people can finally sleep comfortably again.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Inspired by Swami Vivekananda, Jatin {{expressed}} his ideals in simple words: [...] "Amra morbo, jagat jagbe"— [...] "We shall die to awaken the nation". It is corroborated in the tribute paid to Jatin by Charles Tegart, the Intelligence Chief and Police Commissioner of Bengal [...] : [...] "Though I {{had to do}} my duty, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> admiration for him. He died in an open fight." [...] Later in life, Tegart admitted : [...] "Their driving power (...) immense: if the army could be raised or the arms could reach an Indian port, the British would lose the War". Professor Tripathi analysed the added dimensions revealed by the Howrah Case proceedings: acquire arms locally and abroad; raise a guerrilla; create a rising with Indian soldiers; Jatin Mukherjee's action helped improve (especially economically) the people's status. [...] "He had indeed an ambitious dream." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{discussion}} regarding {{her second}} album began, Duff {{said she wanted}} to work with the same team of producers and songwriters with whom she worked on Metamorphosis. [...] " [...] made me feel so comfortable and so secure with myself. I loved working with them. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> relationship with them. I talk to them ... They {{knew what was going on}} in my life, what I was going through ... and how I feel inside", Duff said. For songs she did not co-write, Duff discussed her experiences and feelings with the writers and ask them to write songs about them. Members of the creative team behind Metamorphosis who returned for Hilary Duff include Charlie Midnight, John Shanks and Kara DioGuardi (who collaborated on the commercially released singles), Andre Recke, Marc Swersky and Duff's sister Haylie. Hilary said, [...] "I do have a lot to say, and I have a lot going on inside that sometimes is buried and hidden because I'm working so hard, and I don't have time to think about it. But if we sit down and we talk about it and I tell her how I feel and she writes, it'll be good." ...|$|E
