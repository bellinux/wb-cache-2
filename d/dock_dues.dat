50|$|After the {{emancipation}} {{many of these}} slaves came to England, {{and it was not}} uncommon to see coloured people in Liverpool who bore a mark identifying them as having once been on the servitude of the Tobins. John became Mayor of Liverpool in 1819 and was knighted on the ascension of George IV to the throne. On 19 July 1821, George IV's Coronation Day, Prince's Dock was opened, and the Tobins ship, May, was the first ship which entered and in honour of the occasion she was exempted from paying Town or <b>Dock</b> <b>Dues.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Instead she {{was sold}} in January 1972 to Carnival Cruise Lines {{and after a few}} {{internal}} changes and an update on her colour schemes she was put back into service as Mardi Gras, re-registered in Panama and measuring 18,261 GRT (...) under Panamanian measurement rules (which saved on <b>dock</b> <b>dues),</b> Carnival advertised her however as [...] "27,000 tons of fun!". Carnival's first ship, she left Tilbury on February 26th 1972 for Miami and her new life as a Carnival [...] "fun ship". She sailed for her new owners until 1993, joined in 1975 by her near sister Empress of Britain.|$|E
50|$|In November 1964, {{the former}} CP Empress {{was sold to}} the Greek Line; and the ship was renamed SS Queen Anna Maria. This Queen was rebuilt with a new lido area at the stern and remeasured under Greek rules to 21,716 gross tons, {{implying}} {{a significant reduction in}} size. In fact her genuine tonnage had been increased by superstucture extension at the stern and the measurement was an attempt to reduce <b>dock</b> <b>dues.</b> With accommodation for 168 first-class passengers and for 1,145 tourist-class passengers, she sailed on the Piraeus to Naples to New York City route. Later, she provided service on the Haifa to New York route. In due course, these liner services were replaced by full time, one class, cruising. In 1975, she was laid up at Piraeus for a time.|$|E

50|$|Multihulls {{have more}} {{complicated}} conventional <b>docking</b> <b>due</b> to their wider beam. The beam requires a wider area for construction and dry dock {{and a larger}} haul-out ramp.|$|R
50|$|Only one manned spacecraft, Soyuz 14, docked with Salyut 3. One other spacecraft, Soyuz 15, {{came within}} 40 metres of the station, {{but failed to}} <b>dock</b> <b>due</b> to a {{malfunctioning}} rendezvous system.|$|R
50|$|In early 1968 the Caronia {{was sold}} to Star Shipping, a company owned by US and Panamian interests. Renamed SS Columbia, she sailed to Greece for refitting. Cunard had allowed Caronia to fall behind her {{maintenance}} schedule, and her engines needed a major overhaul. Replacement parts were ordered from a Greek company {{rather than from the}} original manufacturer. Whilst she was being rebuilt Andrew Konstaninidis took control of Columbia, buying out the other owners of Star Line and renaming her the SS Caribia. Her refitting was completed and she was given a new all-white colour scheme. She was registered in Panama, with her tonnage reduced to 25,794 GRT under Panamanian rules (which saved <b>dock</b> <b>dues).</b> February 1969 saw the Caribia embark on her first cruise from New York to the Caribbean. The voyage was hindered by a malfunction in her waste system. Things turned for the worse on her second cruise, when an explosion in the engine room resulted in the death of one crew member and the severe scalding of another. In addition the ship lost all electrical power for twenty hours before repairs allowed her to return to port. The incident undermined public confidence in the vessel. The Caribia limped back to New York, never to make a commercial voyage again.|$|E
50|$|In late August 2013, the ROC {{government}} {{announced that it}} would spend US$112 million on upgrading the island's airstrip, and constructing a dock capable of allowing its 3,000-ton Coast Guard cutters to <b>dock,</b> <b>due</b> to be completed by 2016.|$|R
50|$|On 18 December 1931, {{a freight}} train became divided at Dagenham <b>Dock.</b> <b>Due</b> to a signalman's error, a {{passenger}} train ran into the rear portion of the freight. Two {{people were killed and}} several were injured in the incident.|$|R
50|$|Four further {{locomotives}} {{were constructed}} in 1896 as replacements for the B4 class 0-4-0T dock shunters at Southampton <b>Docks</b> <b>due</b> to their increased coal and water capacity and enhanced power. This {{proved to be}} one of Adams's last deeds on the LSWR, as he retired to be replaced by Dugald Drummond.|$|R
50|$|In May 2012, Sergio Ermotti, Group CEO, {{spoke at}} the UBS AGM about the changes {{implemented}} following the scandal. Ermotti spoke of improved internal monitoring and deficiencies in the financial reporting control system that have been addressed. Ermotti also made reference to employees that have been replaced or had pay <b>docked</b> <b>due</b> to serious mistakes or unreasonable behaviour.|$|R
50|$|The Tweed Dock officially {{opened in}} October 1876, {{replacing}} the older port {{on the north}} {{bank of the river}} which had become inadequate. Following improvement works in 1993 vessels with a maximum beam of 16 metres are now able to enter the <b>dock.</b> <b>Due</b> to its geographical location the port primarily handles cargoes linked to the agricultural industry, with fertilisers, malting barley, feed barley and oilseed rape the principal commodities.|$|R
5000|$|American David Ross (William Holden), {{a former}} tugboat captain {{now in the}} Canadian army, is hastily {{commissioned}} in the Royal Navy and assigned to rotating command of W88, a double-screwed rescue tug then in dry <b>dock</b> <b>due</b> to battle damage. His predecessor was a suicide. The slow, poorly armed tugs bring in [...] "lame ducks," [...] freighters crippled near Britain by German attacks. The main danger is from U-boats and aircraft.|$|R

25|$|Dan Stapleton of PC Gamer {{praised the}} {{versatility}} {{of the strategic}} zoom, and expressed his loathing of the next game that wouldn't feature it. The dual-screen mode was highly regarded, the mission design was praised, and the emotional presence of the story was also recognized. However, a few points were <b>docked</b> <b>due</b> to the general lack of diverse unit types, and the game's system requirements. It received a PC Gamer Editor's Choice Award with a score of 91%.|$|R
5000|$|The Royal Navy Headquarters (RNHQ) Merseyside is on Brunswick Dock, which {{includes}} the HMS Eaglet establishment of the Royal Naval Reserve. The Archer class patrol vessels HMS Biter and HMS Charger are based in the <b>dock.</b> <b>Due</b> to tidal restrictions at Brunswick, however, the two ships {{spend most of their}} time at Langton Dock in the North dock system in order to enable them to carry out their University Royal Naval Unit training programs more effectively.|$|R
50|$|On 1 April 2015, INS Sumitra reached Aden to {{evacuate}} 349 Indians. When Air India {{was permitted to}} fly to Yemen on 3 April 2015, it started evacuating people from Sana'a to Djibouti and Djibouti to Mumbai or Kochi. Two C-17 Globemasters flew nine sorties to Mumbai and two to Kochi from Djibouti. On 4 April 2015, INS Mumbai reached Aden {{but was unable to}} <b>dock</b> <b>due</b> to shelling, so the people were ferried to the ship in small boats.|$|R
50|$|Prior to {{completion}} of the bridge in 1966, an automobile-carrying passenger ferry service had operated at this location, but the docks had rotted and silt had filled in the areas where the large ferryboats, if their service was to be restored, would need to <b>dock.</b> <b>Due</b> to a dredging restriction in place because of Kepone contamination, it was not feasible to restore the automobile-carrying ferry service, although a similar operation was still serving about 35 mi downstream at the Jamestown Ferry.|$|R
50|$|Progress M1-7 was {{launched}} by a Soyuz-FG carrier rocket from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Launch occurred at 18:24:12 GMT on 26 November 2001. The spacecraft docked with the Aft port of the Zvezda module at 19:43:02 GMT on 28 November. It {{was unable to}} establish a hard <b>dock</b> <b>due</b> to debris from Progress M-45 on the docking port, {{which had to be}} removed in an unscheduled extra-vehicular activity on 3 December, after which it was able to establish a hard dock.|$|R
50|$|Piglets can be {{subjected}} to castration, tail docking to prevent tail biting, teeth clipping, and earmarking and tattooing for litter identification. Treatments are usually made without any pain killers. Weak runts could be killed shortly after birth. Injections with a high availability iron solution often are given, as sow's milk is low in iron. The <b>docking</b> <b>due</b> to tail biting is a common practice in intensive rearing facilities as animals in that environment {{are more prone to}} increased levels of aggression and instability.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the summer}} months, {{additional}} services are provided between [...] and , although the stopping pattern of these trains are highly constrained {{due to the}} single track between [...] and [...] and appear to vary from year to year. In recent years, these trains have taken the path {{of two of the}} regular Arriva Trains Wales services with modification to the stations served, and timings at stations other than Pembroke <b>Dock</b> <b>due</b> to the handling characteristics of the High Speed Trains.|$|R

25|$|Everton are {{currently}} looking to relocate. The club have had previously raised the subject before in 1996, and in 2003 {{were forced to}} scrap plans for a 55,000-seat stadium at King's <b>Dock</b> <b>due</b> to financial reasons. The latest plan has been to move beyond Liverpool's council boundary to Kirkby, but this has proved controversial with some fans, as well {{as members of the}} local community. At one point there was much talk for Everton to ground-share with Liverpool, at the proposed new Stanley Park Stadium, but this was not progressed by either club.|$|R
50|$|Solovyev {{commanded}} the mission, with Savinykh as his flight engineer, while Bulgarian Aleksandr Panayatov Aleksandrov flew {{as a research}} cosmonaut. Aleksandrov was the second Bulgarian to fly in space, the first being Georgi Ivanov, who flew on Soyuz 33. Ivanov failed to reach the Salyut 6 space station as his mission was aborted prior to <b>docking</b> <b>due</b> to an engine failure aboard his spacecraft Soyuz 33. As a result, prior to EP-2, Bulgaria was the only Eastern European Soviet ally to not have one of its citizens visit a Soviet space station.|$|R

Hopping mad, he storms back to his office, but is soon approached by an unknown man who introduces himself as Oliver Nedeljković (Vladan Živković) and proceeds to offer Pantić a bribe in return for his approval when it comes to decision on new hiring. Though short on money, Pantić refuses the payoff and reports the corruption attempt to director Šoić.|$|R
