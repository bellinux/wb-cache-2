5|$|For its {{coverage}} of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, some (such as Ed Koch) have claimed that the paper is pro-Palestinian, while others (such as As`ad AbuKhalil) <b>have</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> it is pro-Israel. The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy, by political science professors John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, alleges that The New York Times sometimes criticizes Israeli policies but is not even-handed and is generally pro-Israel. On the other hand, the Simon Wiesenthal Center has criticized The New York Times for printing cartoons regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that were claimed to be anti-Semitic.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1130s England began to descend into {{a period of}} civil war known as the Anarchy, during which the {{supporters}} of King Stephen fought {{with those of the}} Empress Matilda for control of the kingdom. William de Mohun's eldest son, also called William, was a noted supporter of Matilda, and Dunster was considered one of her faction's strongest castles in the south-west. In 1138 forces loyal to Stephen besieged the castle; a siege castle was built nearby, but all trace of it has been lost. William successfully held the castle and was made the Earl of Somerset by the grateful Empress. Chroniclers subsequently complained {{of the way in which}} he subsequently raided and controlled the region by force during the war, causing much destruction. In the aftermath of the conflict, William's son, another William, inherited the castle after a short period of royal ownership under Henry II. William appears to <b>have</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> his tenants agree to help repair and maintain the castle walls as part of their feudal service.|$|E

25|$|In the 2000 presidential elections, PAN {{candidate}} (and eventual winner) Vicente Fox used homosexual stereotypes to demean and humiliate {{his principal}} opponent (Francisco Labastida). Fox accused Labastida {{of being a}} sissy and a mama's boy and nicknamed him Lavestida ("the cross-dressed"). When Mexico City and Coahuila legalized same-sex civil unions the chief opposition came from the PAN, former President Vicente Fox and former President Felipe Calderón. Since then the party has opposed similar bills, with the rationale of protecting traditional family values. Nonetheless, PAN officials <b>have</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> homosexuals have rights as human beings and should in no case be subjected to hatred or physical violence.|$|E
25|$|By 2012, the Cázares {{claimed the}} Tamaulipas agency had not {{questioned}} potential suspects or eyewitnesses of the kidnapping, nor had they visited the locations {{relevant to the}} case. The Cázares <b>have</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> authorities should start by investigating the house they were taken following their kidnapping, given that it is located just {{a block away from}} a busy street in Matamoros. In March 2012, an electricity bill was found {{on the door of the}} premises. The bill showed that the service was used exponentially during the month the family was kidnapped, and that the last time someone paid the bill was on January 2011. A neighbor who lived near the house where the Cázares were held hostage said he did not know who the owners of the property were but did acknowledge seeing suspicious activity during the evenings. On March 7, about 10 months after the mass kidnapping, Gérald Martin, the General Consul of France in Mexico, told the Cázares family that a squadron of Mexico's Federal Police had been dispatched to Matamoros to work directly on the case. The family claims, however, that were not sure if the investigation was actually carried out. They said they did not receive any documents of the investigation. By October 2012, a criminal court in Jalisco under judge Francisco Martín Hernández Zaragoza was assigned to investigate the case. The family claims they do not know the details of the investigation.|$|E

500|$|The {{families}} living in Duxbury (sometimes [...] "Duxborough") {{asked to be}} set off from Plymouth as a separate town with their own church and minister; this request was granted in 1637. [...] Historian Justin Winsor and others <b>have</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> the name of Duxbury was given by Standish in honor of Duxbury Hall, near Chorley in Lancashire, which was owned by {{a branch of the}} Standish family.

500|$|In an [...] "IAmA" [...] thread on Reddit, DraftKings CEO Jason Robins {{described}} the service as being [...] "almost identical to a casino", {{described the}} concept of DFS as a cross between fantasy sports and online poker, and repeatedly referred to the service using gambling-oriented terms such as [...] "wager" [...] and [...] "betting". DraftKings and FanDuel have also entered into affiliation and sponsorship agreements with gambling-oriented entities; DraftKings sponsored the 2015 Belmont Stakes and the World Series of Poker, while FanDuel has affiliated with websites related to sports betting. At the same time, both companies <b>have</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> their daily fantasy games represent a game of skill. In the 2007 federal lawsuit Humphrey v. Viacom, Inc., Judge Dennis M. Cavanaugh of the U.S. District Court of New Jersey distinguished an [...] "entry fee" [...] in a paid fantasy sports competition as being a fee required to participate rather than a [...] "wager", because they are [...] "paid unconditionally", and because the prizes in such games were [...] "guaranteed" [...] and determined in advance.|$|E

Historian Enrique Ayala Mora, too, estimates that the indigenous population is no more than sixteen percent. Other organizations, such as CONAIE, while giving varying estimates in different years, tend to approximate closer to four million.

2500|$|European {{immigrant}} beer brewers in {{the early}} 20th century had their own campaign against the native pulque, claiming that pulque producers used a muñeca (doll), a textile bag containing human or animal feces which {{was placed in the}} aguamiel to hasten the fermentation process. Some pulque producers <b>have</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> the muñeca is completely a myth, but modern historians suggest that it did happen, although only rarely. Beer producers promoted the idea that pulque was generally made this way, generally by word of mouth and insinuation. This was done to inhibit pulque sales and to promote the consumption of beer, which they claimed was [...] "rigorously hygienic and modern".|$|E
2500|$|In {{keeping with}} the Church's {{teaching}} on universality and with the Nicene Creed, Orthodox authorities such as Saint Raphael of Brooklyn <b>have</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> the full name of the church has always included the term [...] "Catholic", as in [...] "Holy Orthodox Catholic Apostolic Church". The official name of the Eastern Orthodox Church is the Orthodox Catholic Church. It is the name by which the church refers to itself in its liturgical or canonical texts, in official publications, and in official contexts or administrative documents. Orthodox teachers refer to the Church as Catholic. This name and longer variants containing [...] "Catholic" [...] are also recognized and referenced in other books and publications by secular or non-Orthodox writers.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1967 {{interview}} when a Canadian interviewer {{mentioned the}} Rastafari {{belief that he}} was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ, he responded by saying: [...] "I have heard of this idea. I also met certain Rastafarians. I told them clearly that I am a man, that I am mortal, and that I will be replaced by the oncoming generation, and that they should never make a mistake in assuming or pretending that a human being is emanated from a deity." [...] His grandson Ermias Sahle Selassie has said that there is [...] "no doubt that Haile Selassie did not encourage the Rastafari movement". For some Rastas, Haile Selassie's denials are taken as evidence was that he was indeed the incarnation of God. However, critics of the religion <b>have</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> Haile Selassie was merely a human being who never claimed to be God.|$|E

2500|$|At the Doullens Conference (26 March), Haig {{accepted}} {{the appointment of}} Foch to coordinate reserves of all nationalities wherever he saw fit. In his typed diary Haig claimed {{much of the credit}} for Foch's appointment and to <b>have</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> he have wider powers over Petain than Clemenceau had wanted to grant him. However, the typed version of Haig's diary, although fuller, does not specifically contradict the handwritten original, and {{it has been suggested that}} Haig either needed to reconcile himself psychologically to the need to accept a French superior or else was simply letting off steam and wanted to give himself the credit he felt he deserved. Milner, who represented the British government at Doullens, recorded that Clemenceau was unhappy with Petain's recent efforts, but claimed that he himself had persuaded Haig to accept the appointment of Foch; Haig's official biographer Duff Cooper gave Haig the credit but commented that the idea had probably occurred to several participants simultaneously. Wilson recorded that Haig seemed [...] "10 years younger" [...] that evening after Doullens.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{recurring}} {{themes of}} Heidegger's later writings are poetry and technology. Heidegger sees poetry and technology as two contrasting ways of [...] "revealing." [...] Poetry reveals {{being in the}} way in which, if it is genuine poetry, it commences something new. Technology, on the other hand, when it gets going, inaugurates the world of the dichotomous subject and object, which modern philosophy commencing with Descartes also reveals. But with modern technology a new stage of revealing is reached, in which the subject-object distinction is overcome even in the [...] "material" [...] world of technology. The essence of modern technology is the conversion of the whole universe of beings into an undifferentiated [...] "standing reserve" [...] (Bestand) of energy available for any use to which humans choose to put it. Heidegger described the essence of modern technology as Gestell, or [...] "enframing." [...] Heidegger does not unequivocally condemn technology: while he acknowledges that modern technology contains grave dangers, Heidegger nevertheless also argues that it may constitute a chance for human beings to enter a new epoch in their relation to being. Despite this, some commentators <b>have</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> an agrarian nostalgia permeates his later work.|$|E
2500|$|The Adventist Church world {{church does}} not officially, at this time, support the {{ordination}} of women to ministry within its standard procedures. Instead women pastors in the denomination hold the title of [...] "commissioned" [...] rather than [...] "ordained," [...] which allows them to perform almost all of the pastoral functions their male colleagues perform but with a lesser title. This compromise was reached during the 1990s, with disagreement primarily occurring along cultural lines. Although the Seventh-day Adventist Church has no written policy forbidding {{the ordination of}} women, it has traditionally ordained only men. From its formation, Adventists traditionally held to the view that no precedent for the practice of ordaining women can be found in Scripture or in the writings of Ellen G. White and the early Seventh-day Adventist Church. However, in recent years {{the ordination of women}} {{has been the subject of}} heated debate, especially in North America and Europe. In the Adventist church, candidates for ordination are chosen by local conferences (which usually administer about 50-150 local congregations) and approved by unions (which serve about 6-12 conferences). The world headquarters—the General Conference—says that the GC has the right to set the worldwide qualifications for ordination, including gender requirements. GC leaders have never taken the position that ordination of women is contrary to the Bible, but they <b>have</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> no one ordain women until it is acceptable to all parts of the world church.|$|E
