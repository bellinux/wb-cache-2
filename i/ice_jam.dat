25|$|Typical {{passage to}} La Petite Chute {{included}} crossing the Atlantic from Rotterdam to New York City, a train trip {{from there to}} Albany, a train or Erie Canal-barge trip across New York state to Buffalo, steamship travel through the Great Lakes and Green Bay {{to the head of}} the Fox River at Green Bay and finally a 30-mile, ox-cart trip to the mission at La Petite Chute. The first group from Rotterdam arrived on May 22, 1848, led by a Franciscan missionary, Fr Adrianus D. Godthard. Father Van den Broek’s group, held up by an <b>ice</b> <b>jam</b> on Lake Michigan, arrived on June 10, 1848. The emigrants discovered not plowed fields and a village but forested land, being somewhat misled by wording of the De Tijd advertisements: the word “acres” was translated as akkers, meaning cultivated land. There was also not enough good land in Father Van den Broek’s holdings for all the emigrants. There was a resort to drawing straws, with the winners naturally picking the best lots. Many of the others - led by Cornelis van de Heij, a farmer from Zeeland, and Father Godthard - left to form the village of Holland (usually referred to locally as “Hollandtown”) rather than buying the remainder of Father Van den Broek’s land. There were other Europeans, mainly French and Irish emigrants, already established at La Petite Chute, now also known by its semi-anglicized name of “Little Chute.” A few Native Americans still lived in the area.|$|E

40|$|Midwinter <b>ice</b> <b>jamming</b> {{can be of}} {{considerable}} socioeconomic concern because of flooding, damage to infrastructure, loss of hydropower production, and environmental damages. Climate change projections of greater winter rainfall and warmer temperatures indicate that the length and duration of the ice season and the timing and severity of ice breakup will change, likely resulting in more frequent midwinter <b>ice</b> <b>jams</b> along many Canadian rivers. Therefore, agencies involved with river ice management and disaster response need to develop strategies that consider the likelihood of flood damage and environmental changes resulting from midwinter <b>ice</b> <b>jams.</b> The possibility of midwinter <b>ice</b> <b>jamming</b> {{will have to be}} considered in contingency planning more often and for more stretches of rivers than previously.

5000|$|A river {{icebreaker}} is an icebreaker {{specially designed}} {{to operate in}} shallow waters such as rivers and estuaries, and often able to pass through canals and under bridges. As published by the American Society of Civil Engineers almost a century ago, [...] "On some rivers, particularly where melting first takes place on the upper river, as on the Oder and Weichsel in Germany, the formation of <b>ice</b> <b>jams</b> is a frequent cause of floods."

40|$|Introduction a. Nonstructural ice control {{encompasses}} {{methods used}} {{for reducing the}} frequency and severity of damages from <b>ice</b> <b>jams</b> without use of a structure placed in the river. These were the first measures employed to prevent and breakup <b>ice</b> <b>jams.</b> For example, as early as 1758, blasting was used in Germany to remove <b>ice</b> <b>jams</b> (Van der Kley 1965), and icebreaking vessels were used to break river ice starting in the 1880 s (Bolsenga 1968). Nonstructural ice control methods are attractive because they are generally inexpensive and can be applied using readily available equipment and supplies (e. g., chainsaws, trenchers, cropdusters, etc.). Also, these methods are popular because of the perception {{that they can be}} applied on short notice; of course, the best results are obtained with advance planning, because obtaining the necessary permits and equipment, and training of personnel, requires a considerable amount of time.

50|$|In 1807 an <b>ice</b> <b>jam</b> formed below Bangor Village {{raising the}} water 10 to 12 {{feet above the}} normal {{highwater}} mark and in 1887 the freshet caused the Maine Central Railroad Company rails between Bangor and Vanceboro to be covered {{to a depth of}} several feet. Bangor’s worst <b>ice</b> <b>jam</b> floods occurred in 1846 and 1902. Both resulted from mid-December freshets that cleared the upper river of ice, followed by cold that produced large volumes of frazil ice or slush which was carried by high flows forming a major <b>ice</b> <b>jam</b> in the lower river. In March of both years, a dynamic breakup of ice ran into the jam and flooded downtown Bangor. Though no lives were lost and the city recovered quickly, the 1846 and 1902 <b>ice</b> <b>jam</b> floods were economically devastating, according to the Army Corps analysis. Both floods occurred with multiple dams in place and little to no ice-breaking in the lower river. The United States Coast Guard began icebreaker operations on the Penobscot in the 1940s, preventing the formation of frozen ice jams during the winter and providing an unobstructed path for ice-out in the spring. Long-term temperature records show a gradual warming since 1894, which may have reduced the <b>ice</b> <b>jam</b> flood potential at Bangor.|$|E

This occurred during the 2009 Red River Flood and the 2009 Alaska floods. 2.) After the ice dam breaks apart, the sudden surge of water that breaks through the dam can then flood areas downstream of the <b>jam.</b> 3.)
