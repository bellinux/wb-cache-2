40|$|This {{work has}} been carried out to {{simulate}} and analyze the economic advantages of the conventional and the reactive <b>distillation</b> process <b>methods</b> used for the production of ethyl acetate through the Fischer esterification reaction between acetic acid and ethanol with the aid of Aspen Plus. The conventional and the reactive distillation models of the process were developed in Aspen Plus environment by employing an equilibrium reactor and a packed RadFrac column having 23 segments including the condenser and the reboiler. For the reactive <b>distillation</b> process <b>method,</b> the main column was divided into three sections, namely the rectifying(upper), the reaction (middle) and the stripping (lower) sections, but in the conventional process method, the main column was only divided into the rectifying and the stripping sections.

The higher purity of ethyl acetate, the lower total capital cost, the lower operating cost, the lower total utilities cost, the lower equipment cost and the lower total installed cost obtained from the reactive <b>distillation</b> process <b>method</b> have revealed that, in the production of ethyl acetate using the Fischer esterification, the reactive <b>distillation</b> process <b>method</b> was found to be better than the conventional process method both in giving ethyl acetate in higher purity and economically...|$|R
