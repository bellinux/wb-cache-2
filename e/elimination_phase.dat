30|$|Due to a {{relatively}} narrow therapeutic index, lithium intoxication has been a common clinical problem (Timmer and Sands 1999; Hampton 2014). The effective dose range of lithium is 0.6 – 1.0  mmol/l, while in prolonged administration it may be toxic at 1.2  mmol/l or greater (Young 2009). Since lithium {{is one of the}} lightest elements of the periodic table, it is easily distributed throughout total body water (Young 2009; Perrone 2015). Lithium is an alkali metal, like potassium and sodium, which facilitates its rapid distribution (Young 2009).

40|$|Current malaria {{elimination}} {{guidelines are}} based on the concept that malaria transmission becomes heterogeneous in the later <b>phases</b> of malaria <b>elimination</b> [1]. In the pre-elimination and <b>elimination</b> <b>phases,</b> interventions have to be targeted to entire villages or towns with higher malaria incidence until only individual episodes of malaria remain and become the centre of attention [1]. With increasing evidence of clustering of malaria episodes within villages, we argue that there is an intermediate step. Heterogeneity in malaria transmission within villages is present long before areas enter the pre-elimination phase, and identifying and targeting hotspots of malaria transmission should form the cornerstone of both successful malaria control and malaria elimination...|$|R

Pharmacokinetics describes the time course of drug concentrations and is a driver for the time course of drug effects. In this chapter pharmacokinetics is described from a mathematical modeling perspective as applied to clinical toxicology. The pharmacokinetics of drugs are described using a combination of input and disposition (distribution and <b>elimination)</b> <b>phases.</b> A description of the time course of the input and distribution of drugs in overdose provides a basis for understanding the time course of effects of drugs in overdose. Relevant clinical toxicology examples are provided to explain various pharmacokinetic principles.

40|$|Data is at {{the core}} of any {{successful}} vector-borne disease control or elimination activity. At the early stages of control, monitoring data can help prioritize limited funding and resources to maximize impact. During the pre-elimination and <b>elimination</b> <b>phases,</b> surveillance data itself becomes the primary intervention by quickly identifying persistent transmission [1]. In addition, it has been identified that spatial decision-support tools will be crucial to integrate with health information systems (HIS) as countries strive for elimination [2]. The Disease Data Management System (DDMS) is a tool designed to meet the data management and decision-support needs of vector-borne disease control programs as they transition through control to elimination. The development and functionality of the DDMS has been described elsewhere [3], and particular advantages and disadvantages are highlighted in Box 1. Here, we describe the implementation and impact of the system in disease-endemic countries, user feedback, and future challenges...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} calcium sodium ethylenediaminetetra-acetate (CaNa 2 EDTA) on the {{kinetics}} of distribution and excretion of lead (210 Pb) {{have been studied}} in rats. When the chelant was given intravenously, at 50 mg. /rat daily after a single intravenous injection of 100 μg. lead/rat, it greatly increased the urinary excretion of lead but reduced the faecal excretion. The greatest effects occurred in the rats treated with chelant shortly after the lead injection. When the chelant was given seven or more days after the lead the increase in lead excretion was negligible. CaNa 2 EDTA mobilized lead from every tissue, but the kinetic analysis of the disappearance of 210 Pb showed the presence of two <b>elimination</b> <b>phases.</b> Lead ions weakly bound to the cells were rapidly removed by EDTA, whereas the lead fixed to endocellular constituents was only slowly removed.

40|$|We present TAPER, a {{scalable}} {{data replication}} protocol that synchronizes a large {{collection of data}} across multiple geographically distributed replica locations. TAPER {{can be applied to}} a broad range of systems, such as software distribution mirrors, content distribution networks, backup and recovery, and federated file systems. TA-PER is designed to be bandwidth efficient, scalable and content-based, and it does not require prior knowledge of the replica state. To achieve these properties, TA-PER provides: i) four pluggable redundancy <b>elimination</b> <b>phases</b> that balance the trade-off between bandwidth savings and computation overheads, ii) a hierarchical hash tree based directory pruning phase that quickly matches identical data from the granularity of directory trees to individual files, iii) a content-based similarity detection technique using Bloom filters to identify similar files, and iv) a combination of coarse-grained chunk matching with finer-grained block matches to achieve bandwidth efficiency. Through extensive experiments on various datasets, we observe that in comparison with rsync, a widely-used directory synchronization tool, TAPER reduces bandwidth by 15 % to 71 %, performs faster matching, and scales to a larger number of replicas. ...|$|R
