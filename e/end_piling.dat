40|$|Abstract—Excavation and {{retaining}} walls are of challenging issues in civil engineering. In this study, {{the behavior of}} one important type of supporting systems called Contiguous Bored Pile (CBP) retaining wall is investigated using a physical model. Besides, a comparison is made between two modes of free <b>end</b> <b>piles</b> (soft bed) and fixed <b>end</b> <b>piles</b> (stiff bed). Also a back calculation of effective length (the real free length of pile) is done by measuring lateral deflection of piles in different stages of excavation in both aforementioned cases. Based on observed results, for the fixed end mode, the effective length to free length ratio (Leff/L 0) is equal to unity in initial stages of excavation and less than 1 in its final stages in a decreasing manner. While this ratio for free end mode, remains constant during all stages of excavation and is always less than unity...|$|R

40|$|Research in {{the area}} of pile {{foundation}} under seismic condition are still lacking though it is extremely important topic {{in the area}} of geotechnical engineering. In this paper, a comprehensive analysis of <b>end</b> bearing <b>pile</b> under seismic excitation is reported. The case of single <b>end</b> bearing <b>pile</b> without mass {{at the top of the}} pile is considered for the analysis. A seismic excitation of harmonic nature is considered at the base of the <b>end</b> bearing <b>pile</b> for the analysis. Based on Winkler model, a differential equation for pile displacement as a function of depth and time has been obtained by considering the equilibrium equations of a proposed mathematical model. Using the boundary conditions, the pile displacement as a function of depth and time is obtained. Also the variations of rotation, shear force and bending moment with pile depth at a particular time are obtained. An illustrative example shows the results of the analysis. The positions of maximum displacement, rotation, shear force and bending moment along the depth of the pile for a given seismic excitation can be found out...|$|R

In order to study the influence of the jointed dip angle on the bearing characteristics of the <b>pile</b> <b>end,</b> the discrete element models are adopted to simulate the mechanical characteristics of the jointed rock masses, and the model tests of the failure mode of the jointed rock masses were also designed. The results of the numerical calculations and modeling tests show that the joints, which have a filtering effect on the internal stress of the bedrock located at the <b>pile</b> <b>end,</b> change the load transferring paths. And the failure mode of the jointed rock foundation also changes as jointed dip angle changes. The rock located at the <b>pile</b> <b>end</b> generally presents a wedge failure mode. In addition, the Q-S curves obtained by model tests show that the ultimate end bearing {{capacity of a}} single pile is influenced by the jointed dip angle.

Firstly, assuming the surrounding soil of pile to be viscoelastic material and considering its vertical wave effect, the governing equations of soil-pile system subjected to arbitrary harmonic dynamic force are founded {{based on the}} Euler-Bernoulli rod theory. Secondly, the analytical solution of velocity response in frequency domain and its corresponding semianalytical solution of velocity response in time domain are derived by means of Laplace transform technique and separation of variables technique. Based on the obtained solutions, the influence of parameters of <b>pile</b> <b>end</b> soil on the dynamic response is studied in detail for different designing parameters of pile. Lastly, the fictitious soil-pile model and other <b>pile</b> <b>end</b> soil supporting models are compared.
