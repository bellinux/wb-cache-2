40|$|PURPOSE: To {{provide an}} <b>initial</b> <b>planning</b> {{document}} {{that includes the}} information required for a decision {{on whether or not}} to proceed with the preliminary design and implementation plans of a specific survey or survey system. This information combined with the information described in Standard 2 - 1 provides the foundation for a statement of work. KEY TERMS: assessment, design effect, effect size, effective sample size, key variables, minimum substantively significant effect (MSSE), planning document, power, privacy, response rate, survey, and survey system. STANDARD: The <b>initial</b> <b>plan</b> for developing a survey or survey system must include the justification for the study, must describe the survey methodology, and must identify and define key variables. Prior to an OMB fiscal year budget request for data collection, the <b>initial</b> <b>planning</b> document must be presented to the OC/ODC for review and a decision on whether to proceed with the design phase. The <b>initial</b> <b>planning</b> document must include the following: 1. A justification for the survey, including: the rationale for the survey, the goals an...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{approach}} for the extraction of brain tumor boundary {{in a series of}} 2 D MR image slices. The shape and position of tumor in one slice could be assumed to be similar to that in its neighboring slices. Using this correlation between consecutive images, the <b>initial</b> <b>plan</b> applied for each slice is extracted from the resulting boundary of the previous slice. The tumor boundary is located using region and contour deformation, which tolerates a rough <b>initial</b> <b>plan.</b> Therefore, only one coarse manual <b>initial</b> <b>plan</b> is required for the whole series of MR image slices. Performance of our approach is evaluated on MR image set. Comparisons with manual tracing show the accuracy and effectiveness of our approach. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

He posted the <b>initial</b> <b>plans</b> online and asked for input from roller coaster enthusiasts {{from around the world}} on things such as design, theme, and name. After receiving a multitude of emails, Koch determined that [...] "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" [...] was by far the most popular theming suggestion. Construction began in April 1999 with the pouring of concrete footers. The final design and name, The Legend, was released on June 15, 1999.|$|R
