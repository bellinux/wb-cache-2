5|$|The {{development}} of more advanced electronic systems in the 1980s allowed manufacturers to produce snow groomers which could work on and replicate a much wider range of terrains, with the most modern even able to produce half-pipes and ramps for snowboarding. Snow groomers are also {{used in conjunction with}} snow cannons, to ensure that the snow produced is spread evenly across the resort. However, snow groomers have a detrimental effect on the environment within the resort.

40|$|The {{infiltration}} {{potential of}} Portland cement pervious concrete has encouraged its {{use as a}} stormwater management tool. However, the material has suffered historically poor support due {{to a number of}} factors, including failures due to poor mix design and improper construction techniques, concern about lesser structural strength, concern about poor long term performance due to clogging of surface pores and undefined credit for stormwater management. This study focuses on long term infiltration performances of pervious concrete parking lots and their stormwater management credit. Before stormwater management credit could be estimated, it was necessary to develop a testing device to gather information from existing pervious concrete parking lots currently in use. Eight parking lots were examined to determine the <b>infiltration</b> <b>rates</b> of the pervious concrete, as well as to verify the soil <b>infiltration</b> <b>rates</b> beneath pavement.

40|$|Abstract: The {{infiltration}} {{characteristics of}} soils under four different land use practices were studied in Owerri, Southeastern Nigeria. The land use practices considered were: arable crop land, bush fallow, continuously cultivated land and pineapple orchard. The study aimed at examining {{the effect of}} various farming practices on infiltration and determine the degree of relationship between <b>infiltration</b> <b>rates</b> and selected soil properties under different land use practices. The experiment was arranged in a random complete block design which was replicated thrice. The <b>infiltration</b> <b>rates</b> of the soils were measured using the double-ring infiltrometer. Soil samples from these areas were analysed for selected soil physicochemical properties. Data obtained were subjected to analysis of variance, coefficient of variation and correlation and regression analysis. Results showed that bush fallow land had the highest average infiltration of 264 mm/hr while arable crop land experienced the least average rate of 164 mm/hr. From the analysis of variance, there was a highly significant difference (p= 0. 01) in <b>infiltration</b> <b>rates</b> among treatment means. The coefficient of variation {{was found to be}} 3. 35 %. There were appreciable relationships between steady <b>infiltration</b> <b>rates</b> and soil organic matter, bulk density and total porosity in the order r= 0. 963,- 0. 898 and 0. 899, respectively.

The highest rate was used for comparative purposes with the untreated soil. <b>Infiltration</b> <b>rates</b> were consistently lower while sediment yields and concentrations were higher from the treated soil throughout the season.

The experimental design was arranged as completely randomized split-block with twelve treatments, which corresponded to four depths (0 - 0. 05 m; 0. 05 - 0. 10 m; 0. 10 - 0. 20 m and 0. 20 - 0. 40 m) and three conditions of soil use and management with four replications. The soil surface conditions were: conventional tillage (one disking with moulboard plus two levelling passes with harrow), nine months before starting filed experiences; recent conventional tillage (also one disking with moulboard plus two levelling passes with harrow) and native forest. The conventional tillage areas were cropped for about fifteen years with annual cultures.

30|$|Irrespective of {{land use}} type, our {{literature}} review also showed that variability in groundwater recharge in semi-arid environments depends on {{the texture of the}} top soil (Fig.  5). The influence of soil texture on the effect of LULC change on groundwater recharge can be attributed to differences in hydraulic conductivities and water <b>infiltration</b> <b>rates</b> of different soil textures (Gee et al. 1992; Mamedov et al. 2001). Sandy soils have faster water <b>infiltration</b> <b>rates</b> and, in this context, the presence of a closed canopy is highly significant for varying the groundwater recharge, compared with clayey soils with lower <b>infiltration</b> <b>rates.</b> As observed by Santoni et al. (2010) and Wang et al. 2009, an increase in sand content results in deeper wetting fronts in unsaturated condition under similar climatic condition. To exhaustively utilize the precipitation inputs by the natural vegetation, different root traits are needed, i.e., a deeper and denser root system is required as compared to soils with other texture characteristics. This highlights the relationship between natural vegetation composition, soil texture, infiltration, and groundwater recharge.|$|R
