5|$|In cold or inclement weather, several {{nightjar}} {{species can}} slow their metabolism {{and go into}} torpor, notably the common poorwill, which will maintain that state for weeks.

5|$|Melvin {{therefore}} {{resorted to}} arresting suspects– including juveniles, {{some of them}} regarded as vulnerable– and holding them for <b>days</b> <b>without</b> access to lawyers. Of the 359 people arrested {{in connection with the}} inquiry in 1985 and 1986, just 94 were interviewed {{in the presence of a}} lawyer. Many of the confessions that resulted, whether directly about the murder, or about having taken part in the rioting, were made before the lawyer was given access to the interviewee.|$|E

5|$|The British 1st Airborne Division was {{tasked with}} {{securing}} {{the most distant}} objectives; bridges over the Lower Rhine at Arnhem. The division dropped onto the area on 17 September and a small force was able to secure the Arnhem road bridge. However the unexpected presence of SS Panzer troops of the II SS Panzerkorps meant the Allies {{were never able to}} fully secure their objectives and so after nine <b>days</b> <b>without</b> sufficient reinforcement by the advancing ground forces, the division was withdrawn on 25 September.|$|E
5|$|The HV and HVO {{launched}} Operation Southern Move in response, {{removing the}} VRS pressure from Ključ {{and allowing the}} 5th Corps, reinforced by the 7th Corps, to resume its advance and capture Sanski Most on 12 October, by which time a comprehensive ceasefire was to come into effect throughout the country. Combat continued for another eight <b>days</b> <b>without</b> significant changes to the frontlines.

5|$|The group became {{lost and}} confused. After two more <b>days</b> <b>without</b> food, Patrick Dolan {{proposed}} {{that one of}} them should volunteer to die in order to feed the others. Some suggested a duel, while another account describes an attempt to create a lottery to choose a member to sacrifice. Eddy suggested that they keep moving until someone simply fell, but a blizzard forced the group to halt. Antonio the animal handler was the first to die; Franklin Graves was the next casualty.|$|E

Pleased by this scheme, Mac Da Thó takes each {{delegation}} aside in private, and intimates to both that he had awarded the hound to them after much deliberation. Unknowingly, both parties agreed separately that their people should come {{on the same day}} to a feast in Leinster to claim Ailbe formally.|$|E
5|$|Allen, {{shortly after}} Arnold's {{departure}} on the raid, decided, after his successes {{at the southern}} end of the lake, to take and hold Fort St. John himself. To that end, he and about 100 Boys climbed into four bateaux, and began rowing north. After two <b>days</b> <b>without</b> significant food (which they had forgotten to provision in the boats), Allen's small fleet met Arnold's on its way back to Ticonderoga near the foot of the lake. Arnold generously opened his stores to Allen's hungry men, and tried to dissuade Allen from his objective, noting that it was likely the alarm had been raised and troops were on their way to St. John. Allen, likely both stubborn in his determination, and envious of Arnold, persisted.|$|E

50|$|<b>Day</b> <b>Without</b> Art {{began on}} December 1, 1989 as the {{national}} day of action and mourning {{in response to the}} AIDS crisis. To make the public aware that AIDS can touch everyone, and inspire positive action, some 800 U.S. art and AIDS groups participated in the first <b>Day</b> <b>Without</b> Art, shutting down museums, sending staff to volunteer at AIDS services, or sponsoring special exhibitions of work about AIDS. Since then, <b>Day</b> <b>With(out)</b> Art has grown into a collaborative project in which an estimated 8,000 national and international museums, galleries, art centers, AIDS service organizations, libraries, high schools and colleges take part.|$|R

5|$|Hurricane Lorenzo was {{a rapidly}} {{developing}} tropical cyclone that struck the Mexican state of Veracruz in late September 2007. The twelfth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season, it {{formed in the}} southwestern Gulf of Mexico from a tropical wave. After meandering for two <b>days</b> <b>without</b> development, the storm began a steady westward track as its structure became better organized. In an 18‑hour period, Lorenzo's winds increased from 35mph (55km/h) to 80mph (130km/h), or from a tropical depression to a hurricane. On September28 it struck near Tecolutla, Veracruz, a month after Hurricane Dean affected the same area, before it quickly dissipated over land.|$|E

Edge, {{as part of}} scripted events, {{defeated}} both Van Dam and Cena to become the new WWE champion, after pinning Van Dam. The following night on ECW on Sci Fi, Van Dam lost the ECW title to The Big Show, after the Big Show received assistance from Paul Heyman, who declined to make the three-count for Van Dam, but instead gave the pinfall to the Big Show. Later on WWE's official website, {{it was announced that}} Heyman suspended Van Dam for 30 <b>days</b> <b>without</b> giving a reason. This angle was written after WWE suspended Van Dam for his recent drug possession arrest.|$|E
