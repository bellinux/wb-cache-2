40|$|Based on {{thermal value}} theory, {{the aim of}} this paper is to deduce the {{theoretical}} formulas for evaluating the energy ef-fective utilization degree in technological pyrological processes exemplified by metallurgical <b>heating</b> <b>furnaces.</b> <b>Heat</b> transfer models for continuous <b>heating</b> <b>furnaces,</b> batch-type <b>heating</b> <b>furnaces,</b> and regenerative <b>heating</b> <b>furnaces</b> are es-tablished, respectively. By analyzing the movement path of injected infinitesimal heat attached on steel or gas, thermal value equations of continuous, batch-type, and regenerative <b>heating</b> <b>furnaces</b> are derived. Then the influences of such factors as hot charging, gas preheating and intake time of heat on energy effective utilization degree are discussed by thermal value equations. The results show that thermal value rises with hot charging and air preheating for continuous <b>heating</b> <b>furnaces,</b> with shorter intake time when heat is attached on steel or longer intake time when heat is attached on gas for batch-type <b>heating</b> <b>furnaces</b> and that with more heat supply at early heating stage or less at late stage for regen-erative <b>heating</b> <b>furnaces...</b>|$|R

It was a nice earner for Monsieur Paris and his descendants, {{all the way down}} to 1878, when it was the occasion for a minor diplomatic incident. Uxbridge's son visited, to find the bones not buried, but on open display. On investigation by the Belgian ambassador in London, it was discovered that they had been exposed in a storm which uprooted the willow tree beside which they were buried. The ambassador demanded repatriation of the relics to England but the Paris family refused, instead offering to sell the bones to the Uxbridge family, who were enraged. At this point the Belgian Minister of Justice intervened, ordering the bones to be reburied. However, the bones were not reburied; they were kept hidden. In 1934, after the last Monsieur Paris died in Brussels, his widow found them in his study, along with documentation proving their provenance.
