5|$|The {{taste of}} the red wine depends on the {{ripeness}} of the grapes from which it is made. Red berry fruit flavors like raspberry predominate <b>in</b> <b>wines</b> from cooler areas, whereas blackberry, anise and pepper notes are more common <b>in</b> <b>wines</b> made <b>in</b> warmer areas and <b>in</b> <b>wines</b> made from the earlier-ripening Primitivo clone.|$|R
50|$|Biogenic amines are {{naturally}} present in grapes or can occur during the vinification and aging processes, essentially {{due to the}} microorganism’s activity. When present <b>in</b> <b>wines</b> <b>in</b> high amount, biogenic amines may cause not only organoleptic defects but also adverse effects in sensitive human individuals, namely due to the toxicity of histamine, tyramine and putrescine. Even though there are no legal limits for the concentration of biogenic amines <b>in</b> <b>wines,</b> some European countries only recommend maximum limits for histamine. In this sense, biogenic amines <b>in</b> <b>wines</b> have been widely studied. The determination of amines <b>in</b> <b>wines</b> is commonly achieved by liquid chromatography, using derivatization reagents {{in order to promote}} its eparation and detection. In alternative, other promising methodologies have been developed using capillary electrophoresis or biosensors, revealing lower costs and faster results, without needing a derivatization step. It is still a challenge to develop faster and inexpensive techniques or methodologies to apply <b>in</b> the <b>wine</b> industry.|$|R

25|$|The natural {{esterification}} {{that takes}} place <b>in</b> <b>wines</b> and other alcoholic beverages during the aging process {{is an example of}} acid-catalysed esterification. Over time, the acidity of the acetic acid and tannins <b>in</b> an aging <b>wine</b> will catalytically protonate other organic acids (including acetic acid itself), encouraging ethanol to react as a nucleophile. As a result, ethyl acetate – the ester of ethanol and acetic acid—is the most abundant ester <b>in</b> <b>wines.</b> Other combinations of organic alcohols (such as phenol-containing compounds) and organic acids lead to a variety of different esters <b>in</b> <b>wines,</b> contributing to their different flavours, smells and tastes. Of course, when compared to sulfuric acid conditions, the acid conditions <b>in</b> a <b>wine</b> are mild, so yield is low (often in tenths or hundredths of a percentage point by volume) and take years for ester to accumulate.|$|R

40|$|In this work, new {{analytical}} {{approaches for}} determination of biogenic amines <b>in</b> <b>wines</b> were developed.

Additionally, exploiting the Berthelot reaction, the TLS fast screening of biogenic amines <b>in</b> <b>wines,</b> following the release of ammonia by transglutaminase, was also proposed.

5|$|Land {{transport}} remained {{much more}} expensive than river or sea transport during the period. Many towns in this period, including York, Exeter and Lincoln, were linked to the oceans by navigable rivers and could act as seaports, with Bristol's port coming to dominate the lucrative trade <b>in</b> <b>wine</b> with Gascony by the 13th century, but shipbuilding generally remained on a modest scale and economically unimportant to England at this time. Transport remained very costly {{in comparison to the}} overall price of products. By the 13th century, groups of common carriers ran carting businesses, and carting brokers existed in London to link traders and carters. These used the four major land routes crossing England: Ermine Street, the Fosse Way, Icknield Street and Watling Street. A large number of bridges were built during the 12th century to improve the trade network.|$|E
5|$|Beer {{contains}} ethyl alcohol, {{the same}} chemical that is present <b>in</b> <b>wine</b> and distilled spirits and as such, beer consumption has short-term psychological and physiological {{effects on the}} user. Different concentrations of alcohol {{in the human body}} have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the beer and the timespan over which the consumption took place, the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription, over-the-counter or street drugs, among other factors. Drinking enough to cause a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria, increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a flushed, red appearance in the face and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes lethargy, sedation, balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g., slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia, vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit (pulmonary aspiration) while unconscious) and respiratory depression (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a coma (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal alcohol poisoning. As with all alcoholic drinks, drinking while driving, operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have severe criminal penalties against drunk driving.|$|E
5|$|The {{aging of}} high quality red wine {{required}} specialized knowledge as well as expensive storage and equipment, and resulted in an even more expensive end product. Judging from the advice given in many medieval documents on how to salvage wine that bore signs of going bad, preservation {{must have been a}} widespread problem. Even if vinegar was a common ingredient, there was only so much of it that could be used. In the 14th century cookbook Le Viandier there are several methods for salvaging spoiling wine; making sure that the wine barrels are always topped up or adding a mixture of dried and boiled white grape seeds with the ash of dried and burnt lees of white wine were both effective bactericides, even if the chemical processes were not understood at the time. Spiced or mulled wine was not only popular among the affluent, but was also considered especially healthy by physicians. Wine was believed to act as a kind of vaporizer and conduit of other foodstuffs to every part of the body, and the addition of fragrant and exotic spices would make it even more wholesome. Spiced wines were usually made by mixing an ordinary (red) wine with an assortment of spices such as ginger, cardamom, pepper, grains of paradise, nutmeg, cloves and sugar. These would be contained in small bags which were either steeped <b>in</b> <b>wine</b> or had liquid poured over them to produce hypocras and claré. By the 14th century, bagged spice mixes could be bought ready-made from spice merchants.|$|E

40|$|Resveratrol (3, 5, 4 -trans-trihydroxy{{stilbene}}) is {{a member}} of the stilbene group of phenolic compounds, comprising two aromatic rings linked by an ethylene bridge and is considered one of the most promising bioactive compounds due to its bioactivity. Wine is one of the main source of this bioactive compound in Mediterranean diet. Several authors have dedicated their research to the relationship between diet and health, and concerning wine and health studies, ‘‘French Paradox’’ was the starting point. Resveratrol is found in seeds and skins of grapes and <b>in</b> <b>wines.</b> The red wines are richer than the white ones due to differences in winemaking technology. The amount of resveratrol found <b>in</b> <b>wines</b> varies widely, since a huge number of factors affect its biosynthesis (grape variety, geographic region, climatic conditions, agronomic factors) and its extraction from the solid part of the grapes into the wines (technological practices). Numerous analytical methods are described in literature to determine resveratrol content <b>in</b> <b>wines,</b> but apart few methods reporting direct injection, a previous sample preparation step is required before the injection into a chromatographic system. Liquid chromatography coupled with a fluorescence detector, a diode array detector or a mass spectrometry detector are the most used separation and identification tools, since the use of gas chromatography also requires a derivative step. Recently, the development of molecular imprinting technology based on a mechanism of molecular recognition, and the further applications of the generated molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) as selective sorbents in Solid Phase Extraction (MISPE) or magnetic MIPs (MMIPs) have provided a new versatile tool for the highly selective quantification of resveratrol <b>in</b> <b>wines.</b> <b>In</b> this chapter, the biosynthesis of resveratrol in grapes, the factors affecting resveratrol content <b>in</b> <b>wines</b> and the current analytical methods for resveratrol determination <b>in</b> <b>wines,</b> will be revisited.
