25|$|Temperature: Usually {{conducting}} a reaction {{at a higher}} temperature delivers more energy into the system and increases the reaction rate by causing more collisions between particles, as explained by collision theory. However, the main reason that temperature increases the rate of reaction <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>more</b> of the colliding particles will have the necessary activation energy resulting in more successful collisions (when bonds are formed between reactants). The influence of temperature is described by the Arrhenius equation.|$|E

25|$|A broad genetic {{sampling}} of 95 wild Russian tigers found markedly low genetic diversity, with the effective population size extraordinarily low {{in comparison to}} the census population size, with the population behaving as if it were just 27–35 individuals. Further exacerbating the problem <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>more</b> than 90% of the population occurs in the Sikhote Alin mountain region, and there is little movement of tigers across the development corridor, which separates this sub-population from the much smaller sub-population found in southwest Primorye province.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 {{households}} that earn between $25,000 and $75,000 represent approximately the middle {{half of the}} income distribution tables provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. Over the past two decades, the number of households in those brackets decreased by 3.9%, from 48.2% to 44.3%.

2500|$|Humans also {{influence}} the carbon cycle indirectly {{by changing the}} terrestrial and oceanic biosphere [...] Over the past several centuries, direct and indirect human-caused land use and land cover change (LUCC) {{has led to the}} loss of biodiversity, which lowers ecosystems' resilience to environmental stresses and decreases their ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere. More directly, it often leads to the release of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems into the atmosphere. Deforestation for agricultural purposes removes forests, which hold large amounts of carbon, and replaces them, generally with agricultural or urban areas. Both of these replacement land cover types store comparatively small amounts of carbon, so that the net product of the process <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>more</b> carbon stays in the atmosphere.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{difference}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>more</b> of the photons {{entering the}} camera will be detected by the Foveon X3 photosensor than is possible with a mosaic sensor. This is because {{each of the}} color filters overlaying each photosite of a mosaic sensor passes {{only one of the}} primary colors, absorbing the other two. The absorption of these colors reduces the total amount of light gathered by the sensor and destroys much of the information about the color of the light impinging on each sensor element. Although the Foveon X3 has greater light gathering ability, the individual layers do not respond as sharply to the respective colours. Thus color-indicating information in the sensor's raw data requires [...] "aggressive" [...] matrixing (essentially, removal of common-mode signals) to produce color data in a standard color space, which can increase color noise in low-light situations.|$|E
