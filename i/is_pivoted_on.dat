50|$|Braking {{starts with}} {{applying}} a current {{proportional to the}} desired brake force to the electromagnet (5) which is pulled axially towards the drum. If the wheel is rotating the drum will then pull the actuating arm (4) either {{to the left or}} to the right depending on the rotation of the wheel. The actuating arm <b>is</b> <b>pivoted</b> <b>on</b> the black round pin that is anchored to the brake shield. This in turn applies pressure on one of the brake shoes which comes into contact with the brake drum. The first brake shoe then tries to follow the rotation while asserting friction and thereby propagate the movement onto the second brake shoe through the adjuster which also pushes against the drum. The friction force is then caught by the stopper (Black trapezoid) mounted on the brake shield.|$|E
5000|$|Nissan {{introduced}} its Variable Valve Event and Lift (VVEL) in 2007 as the world's second CVVL system. The first application {{was on the}} VQ37VHR V6 engine of Skyline Coupe (Infiniti G37). Nissan's system is more compact than BMW’s, involving fewer parts and less energy loss, and is therefore more adaptable to high-performance engines. [...] The VVEL does not use a conventional intake camshaft. Each valve is actuated by a cam which <b>is</b> <b>pivoted</b> <b>on</b> - but not fixed to - the camshaft. While conventional camshafts feature fixed rotating lobes, the cam in VVEL swings up and down; {{this is why it}} does not need a symmetric profile. Its movement is driven by the camshaft via a series of components. VVEL varies valve lift by the eccentric control shaft inside the rocker arm. By rotating the eccentric control shaft, the position of rocker arm is shifted, changing the swing angle of cam. The swing angle of cam determines the degree of valve lift.|$|E

We focus on a coordinated multi-point (CoMP) system where a cluster of base stations (BSs) coordinate their transmissions to the intended user. The radar operates in two modes, interference-mitigation mode when it avoids interference with the CoMP system and cooperation mode when it exchanges information with it. Using either the conventional Switched Null Space Projection (SNSP) or the newly proposed Switched Small Singular Value Space Projection (SSSVSP), the radar beam sweeps across the BS clusters focusing on the optimal ones, optimal in either nullity or difference between the precoded and original radar signal. Taking the channel estimation error into account, {{the design of}} precoder <b>is</b> <b>pivoted</b> <b>on</b> the minimal radar interference at the BS clusters during interference-mitigation mode and minimal bit-error-rate at the BSs during cooperation mode while interfering minimally with the radar target detection capability.

40|$|Bees are an {{important}} group of pollinators and indispensable in agriculture and for maintaining biological diversity. Although indigenous honeybees are used extensively as pollinators in commercial agriculture in africa, other bees are also important pollinators for both commercial and small-scale farming. Although less abundant they are more effective pollinators of many plants. In the afrotropical region bees appear to inhabit all the different biomes, making them {{an important}} reference group for biodiversity studies. Besides, they are an effective indicator group because of their sensitivity to environmental degradation. A detailed knowledge of the systematics of bees is clearly vital for the sustainable use of genetic resources in africa. There are 129 bee genera in sub-saharan africa, of which 83 (64 %) have been revised since 1965, and 25 (19 %) are currently being studied. Of the 73 genera of long-tongued bees in sub-saharan africa 72 either have been revised or are receiving attention. It is therefore possible to identify most of the long-tongued bees. The short-tongued bees, which are more common and also very important pollinators, are less well known. No systematic research is currently being conducted on 33 % (18 of the 55 genera) of the genera. It is imperative that africa does not lose its expertise in bee systematics, which <b>is</b> <b>pivoted</b> <b>on</b> a few individuals, if advances are {{to be made in}} pollination biology...|$|E

The lower right arm of a patient <b>is</b> <b>pivoted</b> <b>on</b> the moving robotic platform. Human-device interaction forces are measured by a force sensor underneath the arm support. Arbitrary motion, i. e. planar robot translation and rotation, on the application surface is facilitated by three assembled omni-wheels. Their design allows for low-friction rolling perpendicular to the attached motor shaft. Each omni-wheel is driven by a DC motor with gear and encoder. Furthermore, separate external power electronics provide analogue current controllers for each motor. A compact, yet powerful device design is achieved by mounting the high-performance drives {{along the edges of}} an equilateral triangle. The configuration is capable of producing a pre-determined range of force (0 - 55 N) and velocity (translational 0 - 0. 6 m/s, rotational 0 - 9 rad/s). The robot weighs 2. 8 kg and has a diameter of 300 mm. At this stage of development, absolute position information is gathered by an infrared camera.

This suggests that the wireless security is still in nascent stage and requires further development. The new wireless technologies like Wireless Body Area Network, thus provides tough challenges to security professionals. Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) technology has been center of attraction in e-health system.

However, the high aspect ratio and considerable filament size of these wires requires the concomitant development of dedicated optimization methods that account for both the critical current density and ac losses in type II superconductors. Here, {{we report on the}} novel application and results of a CPU-efficient semi-analytical computer code based on the Radia 3 D magnetostatics software package. Our algorithm is used to simulate and optimize the energy density of a superconducting magnetic energy storage device model, based on design constraints, such as overall size and number of coils. The rapid performance of the code <b>is</b> <b>pivoted</b> <b>on</b> analytical calculations of the magnetic field based on an efficient implementation of the Biot-Savart law for a large variety of 3 D "base" geometries in the Radia package. The significantly-reduced CPU time and simple data input in conjunction with the consideration of realistic input variables, such as material-specific, temperature and magnetic field-dependent critical current densities have enabled the Radia-based algorithm to outperform finite element approaches by a twenty fold reduction in CPU time at the same accuracy levels. Comparative simulations of MgB 2 and YBCO-based devices are performed at 4. 2 K, and finally, calculations of the ac losses are computed in order to ascertain the realistic efficiency of the design configurations.

40|$|Rationale, {{aims and}} {{objectives}} Research findings consistently suggest that speech and language therapists (SLTs) {{are failing to}} draw effectively on research-based evidence to guide clinical practice. This study aimed to examine what constitutes the reasoning provided by SLTs for treatment choices and whether science plays a part in those decisions. Method This study, based in Ireland, reports on the qualitative phase of a mixed-methods study, which examined attitudes underpinning treatment choices and the therapy process. SLTs were recruited from community, hospital and disability work settings via SLT managers who acted as gatekeepers. A total of three focus groups were run. Data were transcribed, anonymized and analysed using thematic analysis. Results In total, 48 participants {{took part in the}} focus groups. The majority of participants were female, represented senior grades and had basic professional qualifications. Three key themes were identified: practice imperfect; practice as grounded and growing; and critical practice. Findings show that treatment decisions are scaffolded primarily on practice evidence. The uniqueness of each patient results in dynamic and pragmatic practice, constraining the application of unmodified therapies. Conclusion The findings emerging from the data reflect the complexities and paradoxes of clinical practice as described by SLTs. Practice <b>is</b> <b>pivoted</b> <b>on</b> both the patient and clinician, through their membership of groups and as individuals. Scientific thinking is a component of decision making; a tool with which to approach the various ingredients and the dynamic nature of clinical practice.

40|$|The braid group {{dynamics}} captures the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) as {{a manifestation of}} puncture phase. When the dynamics is generalized for particles on a multi-sheeted surface, we obtain new tools which determine the fractional charges, the quantum statistics, and the filling factors of the multi-layered FQHE. A many-quasihole wavefunction is proposed for the bilayered samples. We also predict a ν = 5 / 7 FQHE for triple-layered samples. The viability of 3 -dimensional FQHE and the application of the concept of generalized duality to anyonic superconductivity are discussed. PACS numbers: 71. 28, 71. 10, 72. 20 M 1 Laughlin’s theory [1] of fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) elegantly describes the incompressibility of the 2 -dimensional electronic system under the influence of a strong, uniform magnetic field. The theory <b>is</b> <b>pivoted</b> <b>on</b> an ansätz which is taken to be the ground state ψm of the many-body system displaying FQHE: ψm = ∏ (wa − wb) m exp(− 1 4 ℓ 2 ∑ |wa | 2), (1) a<b where ℓ denotes the magnetic length and wa are the coordinates of N electrons. Now, this ansätz is for single-layered quantum Hall system, with all the spins of the electrons polarized {{in the direction of the}} magnetic field. Since electrons are fermions, in order to have ψm anti-symmetric with respect to the permutation of indices a, m must be an odd number. Recently, however, two experimental groups [2, 3] successfully FQHE. The samples they used were double-layered 2 -dimensional electronic systems. Labelling the two layers and treating them as additional degrees of freedom, the ν = 1 effect was predicted by Yoshioka, MacDonald and Girven (YMG) 2 [4].

40|$|The study {{investigates the}} effect of wealth on {{maternal}} health care utilization in Ghana via its effect on Antenatal care use. Antenatal care serves as the initial point of contact of expectant mothers to maternal health care providers before delivery. The study <b>is</b> <b>pivoted</b> <b>on</b> {{the introduction of the}} free maternal health care policy in April 2005 in Ghana with the aim of reducing the financial barrier to the use of maternal health care services, to help reduce the high rate of maternal deaths. Prior to the introduction of the policy, studies found wealth to have a positive and significant influence on the use of Antenatal care. It is thus expected that with the policy, wealth should not influence the use of maternal health care significantly. Using secondary data from the 2008 Ghana Demographic and Health survey, the results have revealed that wealth still has a significant influence on adequate use of Antenatal care. Education, age, number of living children, transportation and health insurance are other factors that were found to influence the use of Antenatal care in Ghana. There also exist considerable variations in the use of Antenatal care in the geographical regions and between the rural and urban dwellers. It is recommended that to improve the use of Antenatal care and hence maternal health care utilization, some means of support is provided especially to women within the lowest wealth quintiles, like the provision and availability of recommended medication at the health center; secondly, women should be encouraged to pursue education to at least the secondary level since this improves their use of maternal health services. Policy should also target mothers who have had the experience of child birth on the need to use adequate Antenatal care for each pregnancy, since these mothers tend to use less antenatal care for subsequent pregnancies. The regional disparities found may be due to inaccessibility and unavailability of health facilities and services in the rural areas and in some of the regions. The government and other service providers (NGOs, religious institutions and private providers) may endeavor to improve on the distribution of health facilities, human resources, good roads and necessary infrastructure among other things in order to facilitate easy access to health care providers especially for the rural dwellers...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{rebranding}} of Headlines Today, the English {{news channel}} from TV Today Network Ltd, to India Today, its 40 -year-old flagship English news magazine {{was to keep}} pace and move to a world of seamless news on digital devices by adopting non-linear philosophy. The re- launch has given a new dimension of storytelling from shifting linear to being non linear as on the web. India Today can {{claim to be a}} new channel with fresh content. This rebranding has improved the credibility by aligning its idea of an integrated newsroom. This paper is focused to probe into (a) the viability of rebranding of Headlines Today in India Today (b) the role of established print brand of India Today in boosting the brand equity of digital India Today through rebranding (c) the viability of adopting non-linear news telling strategy to draw viewers. Design / Methodology/ Approach: The study being exploratory in nature relies on secondary data collected from print and digital resources. One of the major tools that is applied in study of impact of television channel is Television Rating Point (TRP). The word TRP has now been reworded as TVT (Television Viewership in Thousands) and GRP (Gross Rating Point) is now GVT (Gross Viewership in Thousands). TRP is a tool provided to judge which programmes are viewed the most. This gives an index of the choice of the people and also the popularity of a particular channel. Findings: TV journalism is linear. It has gone beyond that and brought India Today ethos of journalism on to television. India Today is a very big brand, and it exists across mediums. For people who are consuming news, dividing brand or mediums does not work. It is prudent to give brand that he trusts across platforms. With the new look, the channel has also narrow casted various segments of age groups. The group banded everything in Hindi under the name of Aaj Tak and everything in English under India Today. And that strategy has worked really well. Limitations: Sources suggest that a huge number of channels in India use two spots on the cable network (dual frequency) and India Today TV were using dual frequency on multiple networks. However, this increased the chances of sampling and necessitates for re-sampling and retesting empirically on the basis of primary data. Practical implications: Rebranding is not all about changing the logo but there is a broader idea upon which rebranding <b>is</b> <b>pivoted</b> <b>on.</b> It is an expensive process. If rebranding is done just for a tinkering of the logo, without actually reflecting what the audience wants to see, it will not work in the long run. Digitization has given viewers more choice to select what they want to pay for and watch. And with more progress on the digitization front, the future will see more and more TV channels rebranding. Originality/Value: The paper assesses viewership of the English news genre which is so fragile that even minor changes look significant. Based on inputs from Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) and TAM Media Research Pvt. Ltd the trend has been tracked. It was also revealed that the effort of rebranding was paying off...|$|E
