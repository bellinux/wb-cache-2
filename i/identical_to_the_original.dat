Unlike the arcade version, if Pac-Man loses a life while the vitamin appears, the vitamin may not necessarily be forfeited.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{few months}} of his recovery, Wright began work on {{rebuilding}} Taliesin. The new complex was mostly <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> building. The dam was rebuilt; Wright added an observation platform, perhaps inspired by the one he designed in Baraboo. Later, he built a hydroelectric generator in an unsuccessful effort to make Taliesin completely self-sufficient. The generator was built in the style of a Japanese temple. Within only a few years, parts of the structure eroded away. It was demolished in the 1940s.|$|E

5|$|A {{weekend edition}} titled Super Sloppy Double Dare began taping in July 1987 and premiered August 2, 1987, {{with an initial}} 26-episode run. Super Sloppy Double Dare {{featured}} gameplay <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> format; however, physical challenges and obstacles were designed to make a bigger mess. Viewers were encouraged to send in a postcard with their contact information and could win a prize if their card was selected, and a team performing a physical challenge completed the stunt successfully. Episodes of Super Sloppy Double Dare were taped at Unitel Studio in New York City before production moved back to WHYY-TV.|$|E
5|$|After Type-0 {{received}} a 2011 Japan-only release on PSP, Type-0 HD began development in mid-2012 {{as part of}} a move to promote the next generation of gaming consoles, and gave the opportunity for multiple changes to refine the experience for players. Outside of updated graphics and an expanded color palette, Type-0 HD is largely <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> PSP version, although the original's multiplayer functionality was dropped, and additional difficulty levels were implemented. Type-0 HD reached high positions in international sales charts, and has sold over one million copies worldwide as of October 2015. It received praise for its story and battle system, while criticisms have focused on its HD upgrade and localization.|$|E

5000|$|The Pageant of the Masters is {{an annual}} festival {{held by the}} Festival of Arts in Laguna Beach, California.

5|$|To {{mark the}} game's fifteenth anniversary, a port for the Game Boy Advance, titled Sonic the Hedgehog Genesis, was {{released}} on November 14, 2006. While the port is mostly <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>original,</b> it includes several new features not seen in the original Genesis release, {{such as the ability}} to save game progress, a level select option, and inclusion of the Spin Dash move. This version of the game, unlike others, received poor reviews, with a Metacritic score of 33/100. The chief complaints concerned its poor conversion to the Game Boy Advance, resulting in a bad performance and poor implementation of the original music and gameplay.|$|E

5|$|The {{object of}} {{blackjack}} {{is for a}} player to defeat the dealer by obtaining a total as close to 21 as possible without accumulating a total that exceeds this number. In blackjack, the standard rule {{is that if the}} player is dealt a pair of identically ranked initial cards, known as a pair, the player is allowed to split them into separate hands and ask for a new second card for each while placing a full initial bet <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> wager with each. After placing the wager for the split hands the dealer gives the player an additional card for each split card. The two hands created by splitting are considered independently in competition against the dealer. Splitting allows the gambler to turn a bad hand into one or two hands with a good possibility of winning. It also allows the player to double the bet when the dealer busts. Some rules even allow for resplitting until the player has as many as four hands or allow doubling the bet after a split so that each hand has a bet double the original. The standard rules are that when a bet is doubled on a hand, the player is only allowed to draw one more card for that hand.|$|E

5000|$|The 1954 Belgian graphic novel Hors-la-loi by Morris embroiders the Coffeyville events, {{with all}} four Daltons {{dying in the}} end. Morris's comical {{depiction}} of the brothers — as mustachioed quadruplets differing only in their height — having proved popular, a second fictional gang of Dalton brothers <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>originals</b> and presented as their (bungling) cousins became recurring villains in the Lucky Luke series, now written by René Goscinny. These were also depicted in several films including La Ballade des Dalton (animated feature, 1978), Lucky Luke (1991) and Les Dalton (2004).|$|R

[...] Mary Gnaedinger was the editor for the two companion magazines, Famous Fantastic Mysteries and Fantastic Novels, but Sam Moskowitz has suggested that it was unlikely Gnaedinger was the editor for A. Merritt's Fantasy Magazine. [...] The magazine remained in pulp format throughout its short run. [...] It was 132 pages and priced at 25 cents for all five issues. [...] A Canadian edition of all five issues appeared; these were <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>originals</b> in every way except for the back cover advertisement and the format—the Canadian issues were half an inch longer.|$|R
5|$|The Tour du Guet (Watch Tower), {{situated}} in Calais Nord on the Places d'Armes, {{is one of}} the few surviving pre-war buildings. Dating from 1229, when Philip I, Count of Boulogne, built the fortifications of Calais, it {{is one of the}} oldest monuments of Calais, although the oldest remaining traces date to 1302. It has a height of 35–39 metres (sources differ). An earthquake in 1580 split the tower in two, and at one time it threatened to collapse completely. The tower was repaired in 1606, and then had the purpose of serving as a hall to accommodate the merchants of Calais. It was damaged in 1658 when a young stable boy set fire to it, while it was temporarily being used as royal stables during a visit of King Louis XIV. It was not repaired for some 30 years. In 1770, a bell <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> bell of 1348 was cast. Due to its height, from the late 17th century it became an important watchout post for the city for centuries until 1905; the last keeper of the tower was forced to leave in 1926. Abraham Chappe, (a brother of Ignace Chappe) installed a telegraph office in the tower in 1816 and operated for 32 years. It was this office which announced the death of Napoleon I to the French public in 1821. It also had the dual function as lighthouse with a rotating beacon fuelled by oil from 1818. The lantern was finally replaced by a new lighthouse on 15 October 1848. During the First World War, it served as a military observation post and narrowly missed destruction during World War II. This tower has been classified as a historic monument since 6 November 1931.|$|E
