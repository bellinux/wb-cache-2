25|$|Isaac Newton's (1642–1727) {{mathematical}} {{explanation of}} universal gravitation explained the behavior both of objects <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> and {{of objects in}} the heavens {{in a way that}} promoted a worldview in which the natural universe is controlled by laws of nature. This, in turn, suggested a theology in which God created the universe, set it in motion controlled by natural law and retired from the scene. The new awareness of the explanatory power of universal natural law also produced a growing skepticism about such religious staples as miracles (violations of natural law) and about religious books that reported them.|$|E
25|$|The {{erection}} of Mughal tombs to honour {{the dead}} {{was the subject}} of a theological debate conducted in part, through built architecture over several centuries. For the majority of Muslims, the spiritual power (barakat) of visiting the resting places (ziyarat) of those venerated in Islam, was a force by which greater personal sanctity could be achieved. However, orthodox Islam found tombs problematic because a number of Hadith forbade their construction. As a culture also attempting to accommodate, assimilate and subjugate the majority Hindu populace, opposition also came from local traditions which believed dead bodies and the structures over them were impure. For many Muslims at the time of the Taj's construction, tombs could be considered legitimate providing they did not strive for pomp and were seen as a means to provide a reflection of paradise (Jannah) <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth.</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{the course}} of the early church, there were {{numerous}} followers who attached themselves to the Christ and His mission <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>Earth,</b> as well as followers who retained the distinct duty of being commissioned with preserving the quality of life and lessons revealed through the experience of Jesus living, dying, resurrecting and ascending among them. As a matter of practical distinction and logistics, people of varying gifts were accorded stations within the community structure – ranging from the host of agape meals (shared with brotherly and fatherly love), to prophecy and the reading of Scripture, to preaching and interpretations and giving aid to the sick and the poor. Sometime after Pentecost the Church grew to a point where it was no longer possible for the Apostles to minister alone. Overseers (bishops) and assistants (deacons and deaconesses) were appointed to further the mission of the Church.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the more}} {{conservative}} assemblies discourage political involvement, sometimes {{to the extent of}} judging anyone in fellowship who opts to exercise their voting rights in democratic, free elections. This teaching is {{based on the premise that}} the Bible teaches that Christians are citizens of heaven, only sojourners <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth,</b> and therefore ought not to become involved in activities which could be deemed as being too worldly. Some have claimed that the movement, with its upper-class roots, lacks compassion for the plight of the underprivileged, alleging, example, that it was left to non-Brethren like William Wilberforce, Lord Shaftesbury, and other politically active Christians to work toward the abolition of slavery and toward improving the welfare of factory children in the 19th century. Many Brethren, however, see this as unfair criticism and point to George Müller's ministry caring for homeless orphans and also to the sacrifices of its missionaries such as Anthony Norris Groves. It is more reasonable, they claim, to state that the Brethren are more concerned with people's spiritual needs than with their physical condition. However, where physical help is given, it tends to be given directly and not through secular organisations.|$|E
25|$|For him {{science was}} {{the means of}} exposing the immortal nucleus of the human soul. In the days of his full {{strength}} it furnished him recreation and, by the prospects which it opened up to him, gave consolation. Toward {{the end of his}} life it brought him confidence. Gauss' God was not a cold and distant figment of metaphysics, nor a distorted caricature of embittered theology. To man is not vouchsafed that fullness of knowledge which would warrant his arrogantly holding that his blurred vision is the full light and that there can be none other which might report truth as does his. For Gauss, not he who mumbles his creed, but he who lives it, is accepted. He believed that a life worthily spent <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> is the best, the only, preparation for heaven. Religion is not a question of literature, but of life. God's revelation is continuous, not contained in tablets of stone or sacred parchment. A book is inspired when it inspires. The unshakeable idea of personal continuance after death, the firm belief in a last regulator of things, in an eternal, just, omniscient, omnipotent God, formed the basis of his religious life, which harmonized completely with his scientific research.|$|E
500|$|Black {{holes are}} also sought-after {{targets in the}} search for {{gravitational}} waves (cf. Gravitational waves, above). Merging black hole binaries should lead to some of the strongest gravitational wave signals reaching detectors <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>Earth,</b> and the phase directly before the merger ("chirp") {{could be used as a}} [...] "standard candle" [...] to deduce the distance to the merger events–and hence serve as a probe of cosmic expansion at large distances. The gravitational waves produced as a stellar black hole plunges into a supermassive one should provide direct information about the supermassive black hole's geometry.|$|E
40|$|Because of {{the tilt}} of Earth's axis, Polaris (the North Star) {{maintains}} a consistent location in the northern skies as observed from our vantage point <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>Earth's</b> surface.

Because of this relationship, navigators {{have taken advantage of}} Polaris for at least 2000 years.

The second movement is a setting of a lengthy text beginning [...] "" [...] (The Lord provides: He pours his riches down on us; without this nothing <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> would flourish). Bach set it as an unadorned secco recitative, without arioso episodes, accompanied by bare sustained notes in the continuo.

500|$|The {{simplest}} type {{of such a}} wave can be visualized by its {{action on}} a ring of freely floating particles. A sine wave propagating through such a ring towards the reader distorts the ring in a characteristic, rhythmic fashion (animated image to the right). Since Einstein's equations are non-linear, arbitrarily strong gravitational waves do not obey linear superposition, making their description difficult. However, for weak fields, a linear approximation can be made. Such linearized gravitational waves are sufficiently accurate to describe the exceedingly weak waves {{that are expected to}} arrive <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> from far-off cosmic events, which typically result in relative distances increasing and decreasing by [...] or less. Data analysis methods routinely make use of the fact that these linearized waves can be Fourier decomposed.|$|E
