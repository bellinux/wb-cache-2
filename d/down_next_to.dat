25|$|On 6 May 1791, a tearful {{confrontation}} on {{the floor}} of the Commons (officially, and rather irrelevantly, during a debate on the particulars of a bill for the government of Canada) finally shattered the quarter-century friendship of Fox and Burke, as the latter dramatically crossed the floor of the House to sit <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Pitt, taking the support of a good deal of the more conservative Whigs with him. Later, on his deathbed in 1797, Burke would have his wife turn Fox away rather than allow a final reconciliation.|$|E

25|$|Aldikacti’s initial {{challenge}} was with GM's corporate structure, which split its engineers into two categories: the car engineers who would create blueprints for the car, and manufacturing engineers who {{would work out}} the fabrication and assembly issues. Fiero blueprints traveled {{back and forth between}} the two engineering branches, using up time and money. Aldikacti was forced to sit the two teams of engineers <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> one another, allowing for no excuses to why there was “no build” after his design was done. Many modifications in the Fiero’s production needed to be made; for instance, despite his long-standing interest in manufacturing body panels from plastic, Aldikacti consented to metal body pieces, the dies for which were much less costly.|$|E
25|$|The site of {{the mass}} killing of Khojaly {{inhabitants}} was filmed on videotape by Azerbaijani journalist Chingiz Mustafayev. He was accompanied by the Russian journalist Yuri Romanov during the first helicopter flight {{to the scene of}} the tragedy. Romanov described in his memoir how he looked out of the window of the helicopter and literally jumped back from an incredibly horrible view. The whole area up to the horizon was covered with dead bodies of women, elderly people and boys and girls of all ages, from newly born to teenagers. From the mass of bodies two figures caught his sight. An old woman with uncovered gray head was lying face <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> a small girl in a blue jacket. Their legs were tied with barbed wire, and the old woman's hands were tied as well. Both were shot in their heads, and the little girl in her last move was stretching out her hands to her dead grandmother. Shocked, Romanov even forgot about his camera, but after recovering from the shock started filming. However, the helicopter came under the fire, and they had to leave.|$|E

Alf, who was dressed in a bowler hat and holding a cigarette holder, saw [...] "this little waif" [...] sitting on a wrought-iron bench. The 14-year-old Julia said that his hat looked [...] "silly", to which the 15-year-old replied that Julia looked [...] "lovely", and sat <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> her.

Spears also performed the song in several television appearances, including on The Rosie O'Donnell Show, the Late Show with David Letterman, the American Music Awards of 2002, The Oprah Winfrey Show, and Saturday Night Live.

500|$|Alfred 'Freddie' Lennon—always called 'Alf' by his family—was always joking {{but never}} held {{a job for}} very long, preferring to visit Liverpool's many {{vaudeville}} theatres and cinemas, where he knew the usherettes by name.

500|$|Rick Dickinson {{came up with}} {{a number}} of designs for the [...] "ZX82" [...] project before the final ZX Spectrum design. A number of the {{keyboard}} legends changed during the design phase including ARC becoming CIRCLE, FORE becoming INK and BACK becoming PAPER. The Spectrum reused a number of design elements of the ZX81: The ROM code for things such as floating point calculations and expression parsing were very similar (with a few obsolete ZX81 routines left in the Spectrum ROM). The simple keyboard decoding and cassette interfaces were nearly identical (although the latter was now programmed to load/save at a higher speed). The central ULA integrated circuit was somewhat similar although it implemented the major enhancement over the ZX81: A (fully) hardware based television raster generator (with colour) that indirectly gave the new machine approximately four times as much processing power as the ZX81, simply due to the Z80 now being released from this video generation task. A bug in the ULA as originally designed meant that the keyboard did not always scan correctly, and was rectified by a [...] "dead cockroach" [...] (a small circuit board mounted upside <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the CPU) for Issue 1 ZX Spectrums.|$|E
500|$|The Marines, {{especially}} Latham, taught Reckless battlefield {{survival skills}} such as how not to become entangled in barbed wire and to lie down when under fire. She learned to run for a bunker upon hearing the cry, [...] "incoming!" [...] The platoon called it her [...] "hoof training" [...] and [...] "hoof camp". The horse was initially kept in a pasture near the encampment. Reckless had a gentle disposition and soon developed such a rapport with the troops that she was allowed to freely roam about the camp and entered tents at will, sometimes sleeping inside with the troops, and even lying <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Latham's warm tent stove on cold nights. She was fond {{of a wide variety}} of foodstuffs, entertaining the platoon by eating scrambled eggs and drinking Coca-Cola and beer. Food could not be left unattended around her. She was known to eat bacon, buttered toast, chocolate bars, hard candy, shredded wheat, peanut butter sandwiches and mashed potatoes. However, Mitchell advised the platoon that she not be given more than two bottles of Coke a day. [...] Her tastes were not confined to foodstuffs; she once ate her horse blanket, and on another occasion ate $30 worth of Latham's winning poker chips.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} opens with Williams waking up {{on a couch}} next to an unnamed {{sleeping}} male and writes a note that says [...] "I'm sorry". From there she walks to a room and hugs her father, who's mentioned in song. A conversation ensues with Williams taking a photo of someone presumed to be her mother. The video continues with Williams in her room staring at the photo on a mirror, singing about how love, [...] "does not exist." [...] She moves through a costume closet and into a restaurant set, where a rotating cast of men pose as her date. Then into the next room, there's a wedding — everyone is wearing white (the other band members in attendance), but Williams comes dressed in black; she flees the scene from where the bride enters. During the chorus of the song, the clip cuts to the scenes where Williams is lying down on a giant pile of Valentine-themed cards. Throughout the video, clips of Williams singing {{with the rest of}} Paramore in a dim-lighted background are shown. In the video's final moments, Williams spots the same male she woke up to {{at the beginning of the}} video in the crowd at a rock show. After fantasizing of the two being together through all sets from the start of the video, she makes her way back through the various rooms to the original set in the beginning. When Williams sings [...] "And I'm on my way to believing", she returns to the couch where the male is still asleep, and hides the note she wrote in her pocket as she lies back <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|E

500|$|She {{returned}} to the stage wearing a tank top with glittery tomboy looking suspenders and pants for a dance-oriented performance of [...] "Boys". The show continued with [...] "Stronger", in which she wore a paint-covered robe and in some shows a bowler hat. At {{the end of the}} performance, she sat <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> a piano player and talked to the audience before moving into a performance of [...] "I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman". A video interlude spoofing Making the Band-type shows followed, showing Spears and her dancers as a struggling band. She took the stage again in a barge (wearing a black, silver, and gray rock star style jacket and green pants) along with four female dancers to perform [...] "I Love Rock 'n' Roll". The barge was lifted by wires, but pyrotechnics below it made it seem as if it was lifted by fire. When it was above the B-stage, Spears jumped to it with bungee cords. There was a skit in which her dancers chased her, before Spears loses the rock star jacket revealing a glittery red and purple halter top for a performance of [...] "What It's Like To Be Me" [...] in the small stage. She {{returned to}} the main stage for a performance of [...] "Lonely", in which she danced to a video projection of herself. The dancers and the band performed the [...] "Breakdown" [...] interlude. In [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know", she sang on an elevated platform wearing a white evening gown, while two of her dancers performed a routine. Artificial snow fell from the ceiling during the performance.|$|E
