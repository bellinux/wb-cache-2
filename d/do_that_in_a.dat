A case study was performed starting with the diagnosis of the quality management function, identifying the most critical processes. Subsequently, an analysis of the historical data of the company was made to detect problems and prioritize actions. After, the intervention focused on solving a specific process problem following the PDCA cycle and using quality tools in all its steps. The presented methodology can help companies to increase the use of quality tools which, according to recent study, continues to have little use. All tools have proved to be useful and effective.
