60|$|In {{these various}} transformations, the propositions {{of the science}} of number do but fulfill the {{function}} proper to all propositions <b>forming</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> of reasoning, viz., that of enabling us to arrive in an indirect method, by marks of marks, at such of the properties of objects as we can not directly ascertain (or not so conveniently) by experiment. We travel from a given visible or tangible fact, through the truths of numbers, to the facts sought. The given fact is a mark that a certain relation subsists between the quantities {{of some of the}} elements concerned; while the fact sought presupposes a certain relation between the quantities of some other elements: now, if these last quantities are dependent in some known manner upon the former, or vicè versa, we can argue from the numerical relation between the one set of quantities, to determine that which subsists between the other set; the theorems of the calculus affording the intermediate links. And thus one of the two physical facts becomes a mark of the other, by being a mark of a mark of a mark of it.|$|E

The scanner consists of three X-ray sources equipped with 2 * 30 CdWO 4 detectors each. The fluidized bed has a di-ameter of 23 cm and is filled with polystyrene particles (mean diameter 560 µm). The bed is set at minimal fluidization and additional gas is released from a single capillary, <b>forming</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> of bubbles moving upwards through the bed. The scanner measures the shape, size and velocity of the bubbles passing the measuring plane. We present data showing that the scanner can quantify for each bubble its size and velocity.

40|$|Abstract — Unlike the {{terrestrial}} wireless networks that uti-lize the radio channel, underwater networks use the acoustic channel, which poses research {{challenges in the}} medium access control (MAC) protocol design due to its low bandwidth and high propagation delay characteristics. Since most of the MAC protocols for wireless terrestrial networks have been designed with negligible propagation delay in mind, they generally perform poorly when applied directly in underwater acoustic networks, especially for the case of handshaking-based protocols. In this paper, we propose a MACA-based MAC protocol with packet train to multiple neighbors (MACA-MN). It improves the channel utilization by <b>forming</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> of packets destined for multiple neighbors during each round of handshake, which greatly reduces the relative proportion of time wasted due to the propagation delays of control packets. This approach also reduces the hidden terminal problem. Our simulations show that the MACA-MN is able to achieve much higher throughput than the MACA protocol. I...|$|E
