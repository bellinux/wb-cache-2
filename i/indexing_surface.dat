Recently, many high <b>index</b> polarized <b>surfaces,</b> such as GaAs (311) A [8] and (311) B [9 – 13], GaAs (411) A [14], and (411) B [15], have drawn greater attention because QDs grown on theses surfaces have some unique properties, such as the narrow size distribution, high QDs density, and so on. These structure properties can further show their efforts in improving the device performances.

40|$|Whistler mode {{waves in}} the {{magnetosphere}} {{play an important role}} in the energy dynamics of the Earth's radiation belts. Previous theoretical work has been extended to include ions in the fully adiabatic warm plasma theory. Using a finite electron and ion temperature of 1 eV, refractive <b>index</b> <b>surfaces</b> are calculated for 1 - 10 kHz whistler mode {{waves in the}} inner magnetosphere (L less than or similar to 2. 5). For the frequencies of interest, a finite ion temperature is found to have a greater effect on the refractive <b>index</b> <b>surface</b> than the electron temperature and the primary effect is to close an otherwise open refractive <b>index</b> <b>surface.</b> Including a finite ion temperature is especially important when the wave frequency is just above the local lower hybrid resonance frequency. For wave frequencies more than approximate to 1 kHz above the local lower hybrid resonance frequency, including the ion temperature has a negligible effect on the refractive <b>index</b> <b>surface</b> calculation. The results are used to assess previous conclusions on whether in situ whistler mode sources can be realistically used to precipitate energetic electrons. It is found that the number of in situ sources needed to illuminate the inner plasmasphere (L less than or similar to 2. 5) with whistler mode energy may be greater than previously predicted...|$|R

Furthermore, based on the refractive <b>index</b> <b>surface,</b> the refractive <b>indices</b> and effective optical admittances of the forward and backward propagating extraordinary waves (p polarized wave) are analyzed in detail. With regard to the symmetry incidence, optical properties, such as the input optical admittance, transmittance and reflectance, are not identical for an extraordinary wave under common condition, i. e., angular selectivity. Based on an analysis of refractive <b>index</b> <b>surface,</b> the effective optical admittances of the forward and backward propagating extraordinary waves are equal in this particular case; transmittance and reflectance under the symmetry incidence are completely overlapped, similar to findings in the isotropic thin film. We validate our analysis using the developed software package.
