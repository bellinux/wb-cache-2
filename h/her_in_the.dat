5|$|What {{is perhaps}} more {{surprising}} is that Prince of Wales returned to British ownership. There is an entry for <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> supplemental (i.e., late addition) pages for the 1797 volume. One suspects that the Royal Navy recaptured <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West Indies, {{but so far}} evidence for the conjecture is lacking.|$|E
5|$|Alice Grey {{was accused}} with Katherine Hewitt {{of the murder}} of Anne Foulds. Potts does not provide an account of Alice Grey's trial, simply {{recording}} her as one of the Samlesbury witches – which she was not, as {{she was one of those}} identified as having been at the Malkin Tower meeting – and naming <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> list of those found not guilty.|$|E

5|$|Also in 1998, Juanita Broaddrick {{alleged that}} Clinton had raped <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring of 1978, {{although}} she stated {{she did not}} remember the exact date. In another 1998 event, Elizabeth Gracen recanted a six-year-old denial and stated she had a one-night stand with Clinton in 1982. Gracen later apologized to Hillary Clinton. Throughout the year, however, Gracen eluded a subpoena from Kenneth Starr to testify her claim in court.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Wataru Takeishi. The video opens with shots of New York City, and then has Hamasaki on a rooftop. Hamasaki is then singing the track with several different camera angles circulating her and the city. During the first verse, it has her in an apartment, sitting on a couch with a butterfly hair clip; this scene is used throughout the entire video. It then has three shots of her in different clothes; one with a brown leather jacket, brown wig and cowboy hat, the second with a red dress on, and the third with a black jacket and crop hair style. The shot with <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brown leather jacket, brown wig and cowboy hat then shows her on a rooftop singing the song. The final pre-chorus and chorus has her driving through New York City, and has her in a pink dress watching the snow fall; it ends with <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> red dress, holding her hands out for the snow to fall. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album A Best (2016).|$|E
5|$|Around 956, Olaf, at Melkorka's urging, {{decided to}} go abroad to seek his fortune. Hoskuld was opposed and would not provide trade wares, and the {{property}} of Olaf's foster-father Thord was mostly in immobile goods and land. In part to arrange financing for his expedition, his mother Melkorka married Thorbjorn the Feeble, a farmer who had previously assisted <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> management of Melkorkustead. Melkorka and Thorbjorn had a son named Lambi.|$|E

5|$|Aside from appearance, {{the media}} found other aspects to praise. In 2007, Cortana was {{named one of}} the 50 {{greatest}} female characters by Tom's Hardware for the character's determination and fearlessness, which meshed perfectly with the game's protagonist. In 2010, Cracked.com ranked her as first on the list of the supporting characters in video games. In 2011, UGO.com ranked her as the second best video game companion, while Maximum PC included <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> list of the 25 of gaming's greatest sidekicks.|$|E

While the two were staying in Atlanta, he surprised her by taking her to their wedding ceremony which he had arranged without her knowledge.

The marriage was never made official in Italy.|$|E

5|$|B: Bette Davis's {{performance}} in Of Human Bondage was not {{nominated for an}} Oscar. Several influential people at the time campaigned to have her name included on the list, so for that year (and the following year also) the Academy relaxed its rules and allowed a write-in vote. Technically this meant that any performance was eligible to win the award, {{regardless of whether they}} were an official nominee or not. While the Academy does not officially recognize this as a nomination for Davis, they have included <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> list of nominees for the 1935 ceremony on their official website.|$|E
5|$|Bond dispatches Sévérine's {{guards and}} sneaks aboard her boat. After he joins <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shower, {{the two have}} sex. While {{approaching}} Silva's base on Dead Island, Sévérine becomes more afraid and tells Bond {{that it is not}} too late to retreat. However, they are taken prisoner by the guards, handcuffed and escorted through an abandoned city on the island. She explains to Bond that Silva made the natives believe a leak at the local chemical plant required them to evacuate the island. This allowed him to use it as his base of operations. Sévérine is separated from Bond, and is brutally beaten for her betrayal. After Bond is interrogated by Silva, he is taken to a courtyard, where Sévérine is bound to a statue. Silva places a shot glass of whiskey on her head, and challenges Bond to shoot it with an antique percussion cap pistol. Bond misses the target, and Silva responds by shooting <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> head.|$|E
5|$|Booker T and Sharmell fought Robert Roode and Ms. Brooks in a Mixed Tag Team match. The {{encounter}} lasted {{ten minutes}} and forty-seven seconds. Sharmell {{ended up getting}} the pinfall on Brooks with a roll up pin. After the contest, Roode blamed Brooks for the lost, which resulted in Brooks slapping Roode and Roode grabbing her by the hair. Sharmell then came to Brooks' defense, causing Roode to accidentally smack <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face, knocking her out in storyline.|$|E

5|$|Corder {{spent the}} next three days in prison agonising over whether to confess to the crime and make a clean breast of his sins before God.

5|$|Crawford {{continued}} her reign {{as a popular}} movie actress well into the mid-1930s. No More Ladies (1935) co-starred Robert Montgomery and then-husband Franchot Tone, and was a success. Crawford had long pleaded with MGM's head Louis B. Mayer to cast her in more dramatic roles, and although he was reluctant, he cast <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sophisticated comedy-drama I Live My Life (1935), directed by W.S. Van Dyke. It was well received by critics and made a larger profit than the studio had expected.|$|E
5|$|D'Abruzzo {{was cast}} {{independently}} of her {{starring role in}} Avenue Q.

In another coincidence, D'Abruzzo had long {{been a fan of}} the show, and was overjoyed to have the chance to be on it.|$|E
5|$|Darla's just misunderstood. Her {{intentions}} are pure, they're {{just kind of}} warped. From her perspective—first she has to eat—she just happens to eat people! Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. If you really look at her, you can have sympathy and empathy for <b>her.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about that a lot, that she was probably abused growing up. She did what she needed to do to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E
