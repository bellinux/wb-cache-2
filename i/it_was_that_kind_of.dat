In August, Taylor said he shot extra scenes with Hiddleston {{and was about to}} shoot more with Hopkins. Taylor {{explained}} that it was all a part of the [...] "Marvel process" [...] saying, [...] "We're doing full scenes, scenes that were not in the movie before. We're adding scenes, creating scenes, writing scenes for the first time. The one [...] was a fun connective scene... We realised how well Loki was working in the movie, and we wanted to do more with him. So <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing, it was like, 'Oh, we could do this, we could jam this in here' because he's such a wonderful guy to watch do his stuff." [...] Also in August, IMAX Corporation and Marvel Entertainment announced that the film would be digitally re-mastered into the IMAX 3D format and released into IMAX 3D theatres internationally beginning October 30, 2013.|$|E
2500|$|According to Jefferson Airplane's Spencer Dryden, {{the idea}} for [...] "a kind of Woodstock West" [...] began when he and bandmate Jorma Kaukonen {{discussed}} the staging of a free concert with the Grateful Dead and Rolling Stones in Golden Gate Park. Referring to the Stones, Dryden said, [...] "Next to the Beatles they were the biggest rock and roll band in the world, and we wanted them to experience what we were experiencing in San Francisco." [...] As plans were being finalized, Jefferson Airplane were on the road, and by early December they were in Florida, believing the concert plans for Golden Gate Park were proceeding. But by December 4, the plans had broken down, in Paul Kantner's account, because the city and police departments were unhelpful; innate conflict between the hippies of Haight-Ashbury and the police was manifested in obstructiveness. Sears Point Raceway was suggested, but its owners wanted $100,000 in escrow from the Rolling Stones. At the last moment, Dick Carter offered his Altamont Speedway in Alameda County for the festival. Jefferson Airplane flew out of Miami on December 5. Kantner said the location was taken {{in a spirit of}} desperation: [...] "There was no way to control it, no supervision or order." [...] According to Grace Slick, [...] "The vibes were bad. Something was very peculiar, not particularly bad, just real peculiar. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> hazy, abrasive and unsure day. I had expected the loving vibes of Woodstock but that wasn't coming at me. This was a whole different thing." ...|$|E

60|$|The third day, however, Bo was better, and, {{refusing to}} remain in bed, she hobbled to the sitting-room, where she divided her time between staring {{out of the window}} toward the corrals and pestering Helen with {{questions}} she tried to make appear casual.

What she hoped most for was that Carmichael would suddenly develop a little less inclination for Bo. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> treatment the young lady needed.

The panels were ornamented, here and there, with antique carving, representing over and over again an identical device, being a bare arm, holding the torn-off head of some savage beast, which the stranger could not know by species, any more than Agassiz himself could have assigned its type or kindred; because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> natural history of which heraldry alone keeps the menagerie.

6000|$|Few of the maxims for the {{enforcement}} of which, in [...] "Modern Painters," [...] long ago, I got the general character of a lover of paradox, are more singular, or more sure, than the statement, apparently so encouraging to the idle, that if a great thing can be done at all, <b>it</b> can <b>be</b> done easily.

60|$|Our {{friend was}} fond of popularity, and was {{consequently}} {{a bit of a}} sportsman, as most Connaught attorneys are. He had the shooting of two or three bogs, kept a good horse or two, went to all the country races, and made a small book on the events of the Curragh. These accomplishments all had their effect, and as I said before, Mr. Keegan was successful. In appearance he was a large, burly man, gradually growing corpulent, with a soft oily face, on which there was generally a smile; and well for him that there was, for though his smile was not prepossessing, and carried the genuine stamp of deceit, it concealed the malice, treachery, and selfishness which his face so plainly bore without it. His eyes were light, large, and bright, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> brightness which belongs to an opaque, and not to a transparent body--they never sparkled; his mouth was very large, and his lip heavy, and he carried a huge pair of brick-coloured whiskers. His dress was somewhat dandified, but it usually had not a few of the characteristics of a horse jockey; in age he was about forty-five. His wife was some years his senior; he had married her when she was rather falling into the yellow leaf; and though Mr. Hyacinth Keegan was always on perfectly good and confidential terms with his respected father-in-law, report in Carrick on Shannon declared, that great battles took place beside the attorney's fireside, as to who was to have dominion in the house. The lady's temper also might be a little roused by the ill-natured reports which reached her ears, that her handsome Hyacinth lavished more of his attentions and gallantry abroad than at home. Such was the visitor who now came to call at Ballycloran.|$|E
60|$|About {{the third}} or fourth or fifth time that we swung out into the glare--it was along there somewhere, a couple of hours or so after sun-up--it wasn't as {{pleasant}} as it had been. It was beginning to get hot. This was quite noticeable. We had a very long pull, after that, without any shade. Now it is curious how progressively little frets grow and multiply after they once get a start. Things which I didn't mind at all, at first, I began to mind now--and more and more, too, all the time. The first ten or fifteen times I wanted my handkerchief I didn't seem to care; I got along, and said never mind, it isn't any matter, and dropped it out of my mind. But now it was different; I wanted it all the time; it was nag, nag, nag, right along, and no rest; I couldn't get it out of my mind; and so at last I lost my temper and said hang a man that would make a suit of armor without any pockets in it. You see I had my handkerchief in my helmet; and some other things; but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a helmet that you can't take off by yourself. That hadn't occurred to me when I put it there; and in fact I didn't know it. I supposed it would be particularly convenient there. And so now, the thought of its being there, so handy and close by, and yet not get-at-able, made it all the worse and the harder to bear. Yes, the thing that you can't get is the thing that you want, mainly; every one has noticed that. Well, it took my mind off from everything else; took it clear off, and centered it in my helmet; and mile after mile, there it stayed, imagining the handkerchief, picturing the handkerchief; and it was bitter and aggravating to have the salt sweat keep trickling down into my eyes, and I couldn't get at it. It seems like a little thing, on paper, {{but it was not a}} little thing at all; it was the most real kind of misery. I would not say it if it was not so. I made up my mind that I would carry along a reticule next time, let it look how it might, and people say what they would. Of course these iron dudes of the Round Table would think it was scandalous, and maybe raise Sheol about it, but as for me, give me comfort first, and style afterwards. So we jogged along, and now and then we struck a stretch of dust, and it would tumble up in clouds and get into my nose and make me sneeze and cry; and of course I said things I oughtn't to have said, I don't deny that. I am not better than others.|$|E

For example, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of problem in which the problem identified in embodiment design should be solved in process design.

This is especially true of the film's excessively melodramatic climactic events, a bogus tragedy that does not occur in the book and has contrived written all over it... Given how few the opportunities are for women to carry a motion picture, and with the chance to be a positive role model thrown into the bargain, it's not surprising to find Pfeiffer starring in Dangerous Minds, and she is as believable as the film allows her to be. But if this trivialization of involving subject matter is the best a star of her considerable abilities can latch onto, today's actresses have it worse than we've imagined." ...|$|R

Everything was so Bolshevik‚Äîso without discipline and cultivation‚Äîthat only some kind of determined autocracy could solve society's problems and provide the salvation for all of Western humanity.
