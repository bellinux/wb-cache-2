Two units of weight and payment measurement are prominent in Qatna: the mina and the shekel. The mina had different values from region to region but it seems that in Qatna the preferred value was 470g, while the preferred value of the shekel is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure.</b>|$|E

Other attendees included Lostpedia and Television Without Pity. The event highlighted six popular fan-run websites focused on current media. [...] One participant remarked that [...] "The Paley Center itself is trying kind of <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out what this whole blogging thing is, and doesn’t quite get it, {{as evidenced by the}} fact that no urls appeared in the program for the event." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Auld Lang Syne (The New Year's Anthem)" [...] {{garnered}} {{a negative}} response from critics. Mike Diver of the BBC wrote that Carey shows restraint {{for the most}} part of the album, but [...] "Auld Lang Syne (The New Year's Anthem)" [...] as the final track is [...] "slathered in cheesy beats". Rolling Stone writer Caryn Ganz disapproved of the dance beat, saying [...] "It's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out what's 'extra festive' (as the full song title promises) about her 'All I Want for Christmas Is You' update, and far easier to determine what's wrong with 'Auld Lang Syne' (an awkward dance beat)." [...] Juzwiak was critical of the song, describing it as [...] "robotic".|$|E

500|$|Chenoweth was {{previously}} acquainted with Glee creator Ryan Murphy, having {{appeared in his}} 2006 film Running with Scissors. Murphy commented that he loves writing for Chenoweth, and enjoyed pitching songs she had never sung before. She found singing in three different styles, {{as required by the}} role, to be [...] "fun and challenging", and though she had never before sung [...] "Maybe This Time", after singing it on Glee, she went on to use it in shows as her opening number. Chenoweth stated that she would love to return to Glee in the future, a sentiment shared by Murphy. She commented: [...] "they are all working <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out stories all the time. It'd be great for it to make sense for her to come back. This part is like nothing I've had the chance to do on TV." [...] It was confirmed in October 2009 that Chenoweth would reprise the role, which she did in [...] "Home".|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{incarnation of}} [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)" [...] was {{developed during the}} recording sessions for Achtung Baby. While working in Hansa Ton Studios in Berlin, guitarist The Edge and lead singer Bono created the verse. The track was given the working title [...] "Sinatra" [...] {{in reference to the}} artist whose music inspired it. The group reworked it in preparation of Zooropa. The Edge noted [...] "it came to us in installments". Bassist Adam Clayton said [...] "it was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out how we would do it. I mean, {{no one is going to}} mistake us for Frank Sinatra's backing band. A very humble little combo sound is what we ended up with and that really worked." [...] The Edge added [...] "I was playing around on piano with some old-school chord progressions trying to summon up the spirit of Frank Sinatra. It's definitely not from a rock and roll tradition." [...] He worked out a chord progression based on old Tin Pan Alley songs.|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B+" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "a solid example of the show’s mid-period form". However, {{he noted that the}} episode {{is not one of the}} series bests, unlike the way many fans portray it—due largely to the fact that [...] "it allows us to see what it would be like if Mulder and Scully were a happily married couple"—and that [...] "the episode’s monster is a little <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out". Other reviews were more mixed. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files gave the episode a more mixed review, writing [...] "after {{watching}} 'Arcadia', I feel like I just had a couple slices of pizza for dinner on Thanksgiving. Not bad, but hardly the feast I have come to expect." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris, despite praising David Duchovny's performance during the scenes wherein he [...] "rebels against the rules", called the episode's main villains [...] "stereotypes of self-indulgent, insulated suburbanites." ...|$|E

[...] The magazine also panned the game's documentation, stating it as [...] "weak; it explains the commands and options but does not provide any insight into what is happening" [...] but did close that [...] "for those {{who are willing to}} dig for this understanding, the game offers considerable challenge and satisfaction." ...|$|R
50|$|Collectors praised Zipline Batman (the regular version) and {{the three}} initial villains: Joker, Mr. Freeze and Killer Croc, though some {{collectors}} found that the villains were the <b>hardest</b> <b>to</b> find <b>figures</b> and that the variants were plentiful.|$|R
500|$|Rolling Stone writer Caryn Ganz {{disliked the}} two {{original}} ballads, [...] "Christmas Time Is In the Air Again" [...] and [...] "One Child", describing them [...] "both thick with gooey orchestration", but praised [...] "Oh Santa!" [...] and [...] "When Christmas Comes" [...] for their uptempo melodies. However, she was {{confused by the}} re-recording of [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You", saying that [...] "It's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out what's 'extra festive, and quipped that it is [...] "far easier to determine what's wrong with 'Auld Lang Syne' (an awkward dance beat)". Ganz concluded with [...] "the LP's warm heart is in the right place." [...] Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine gave the album {{two and a half}} stars our of five, writing [...] "Everything about Carey’s sequel to 1994’s buoyant, if, in retrospect, safe, Merry Christmas is as desperate and habitual as it is reassuringly predictable." [...] While he continued to label it as an [...] "incredibly adventureless album," [...] he also wrote that it is a [...] "remarkably comforting listen". He felt that Merry Christmas II You was not a sequel, or a remake, but rather an attempt at rewinding time on Carey's part. Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice was critical of Merry Christmas II You. He described [...] "One Child" [...] as a [...] "needless retelling", [...] "Oh Santa!" [...] as trying too hard and too difficult to sing along to and [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You (Extra Festive)" [...] as a desperate attempt at Carey canonising herself for re-recording her own song. [...] "The near-crazed desperation to please listeners for her own sake is all over Merry Christmas II You: A [...] "gift" [...] to her fans (or so she claims) that they, of course, must pay for, it's her fascinating, career-long saga of self-obsession in a nutshell." ...|$|E

I was struggling so <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out what it was that I was supposed to be doing. I kept thinking I’m supposed to be doing something creative. I can’t believe I have such a knack for the vernacular and I don’t have anywhere to apply it." [...] “I felt I had not found my true path. And then a series of events occurred that led me to the point where I didn’t have anything to lose if I wrote a screenplay." [...] She began writing sitcoms with a comedian friend but was plagued by second thoughts about her work. Khouri was frustrated and kept [...] "contemplating and meditating" [...] until she got this idea of [...] "two women going on a crime spree." [...] She felt as if a light bulb had gone on over her head, making her more interested in the idea.|$|E
50|$|KFC {{quickly found}} that it appealed {{strongly}} to children. Chinese parents {{reported that they had}} no preference for any particular fast food restaurant and simply let their children choose. As a result, KFC worked <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out how <b>to</b> appeal to the kids even further. One of the first things KFC found was that children were not at all interested in its logo. In 1995, the bearded, elderly white man that Chinese children found so off-putting was exchanged for a playful cartoon character dubbed 'Chicky.' Other efforts to entice children included play areas, child-height sinks, smaller furniture, and settings for birthday parties, which are a very recent phenomenon in China.|$|R
