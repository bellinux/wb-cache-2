5|$|Brown bears {{typically}} dominate wolf packs in <b>disputes</b> <b>over</b> carcasses, while wolf packs mostly prevail against bears when {{defending their}} den sites. Both species kill each other's young. Wolves eat the brown bears they kill, while brown bears seem to only eat young wolves. Wolf interactions with American black bears are much rarer than with brown bears, because {{of differences in}} habitat preferences. The majority of black bear encounters with wolves occur in the species' northern range, with no interactions being recorded in Mexico. Wolves have been recorded on numerous occasions to actively seek out black bears in their dens and kill them without eating them. Unlike brown bears, black bears frequently lose against wolves in <b>disputes</b> <b>over</b> kills. While encounters with brown and black bears appear to be common, polar bears are rarely encountered by wolves, though there are two records of wolf packs killing polar bear cubs. Wolves also kill the cubs of Asian black bears.|$|E

5|$|Almirante Latorres genesis can {{be traced}} to the {{numerous}} naval arms races between Chile and Argentina, which in turn were spawned by territorial <b>disputes</b> <b>over</b> their mutual borders in Patagonia and Puna de Atacama, along with control of the Beagle Channel. Naval races flared up in the 1890s and in 1902; the latter was eventually settled via British mediation. Provisions in the dispute-ending treaty imposed restrictions on both countries' navies. The United Kingdom's Royal Navy bought the two Constitución-class pre-dreadnought battleships that were being built for Chile, and Argentina sold its two Rivadavia-class armored cruisers under construction in Italy to Japan.|$|E
5|$|Ancient authors {{agreed that}} the worship of Terminus was of Sabine origin, ascribing its {{introduction}} to Rome either to Titus Tatius, the Sabine colleague of Rome's founding king Romulus (traditional reign 753717 BC), or to Romulus' successor Numa Pompilius (717673 BC). Those authors who gave the credit to Numa explained his motivation as the prevention of violent <b>disputes</b> <b>over</b> property. Plutarch further states that, in keeping with Terminus's character as a guarantor of peace, his earliest worship did not involve blood sacrifices.|$|E

5|$|Bregowine (died August 764) was {{a medieval}} Archbishop of Canterbury. Little {{is known of}} his origins or his {{activities}} as archbishop, although a number of stories were told about his possible origins after the Norman conquest in 1066. There are no records of him prior to his becoming archbishop. He possibly owed his elevation to the Kentish monarch. The records after his elevation to Canterbury are mainly about <b>disputes</b> <b>over</b> land, but knowledge {{of his time in}} office is hampered by the destruction of many of the contemporary records. After his death, he was considered a saint and a life about him was written in the 12thcentury.|$|E
5|$|Confusion in naming {{began when}} the tree was {{described}} by all three men with three different names. In Paris, Linnaeus gave the plant the name Rhus succedanea, while it was known commonly as grand vernis du Japon. In London the specimens were named by Miller as Toxicodendron altissima and in Busbridge it was dubbed in the old classification system as Rhus Sinese foliis alatis. There are extant records from the 1750s of <b>disputes</b> <b>over</b> the proper name between Philip Miller and John Ellis, curator of Webb's garden in Busbridge. Rather than the issue being resolved, more names soon appeared for the plant: Jakob Friedrich Ehrhart observed a specimen in Utrecht in 1782 and named it Rhus cacodendron.|$|E
5|$|Daily fantasy {{sports have}} faced notable legal challenges, {{including}} <b>disputes</b> <b>over</b> whether DFS constitutes gambling. Politicians {{and other critics}} have argued that due to their format, players are essentially making proposition wagers on the varying performance of individual athletes in specific games, and not managing {{the performance of their}} selections on a week-to-week basis. Proponents have defended DFS as being a game of skill, as the required familiarity with the players and teams, as well as salary cap management, rewards skilled players. Local laws have varying definitions of gambling games, such as whether a game's elements of chance are predominant over those or skill, or how much control the player has over the outcome of the game.|$|E
