He then used stairways to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 104th floor, walked past a sleeping security guard, and climbed up a ladder to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> antenna, where he took pictures for two hours. The elevator operator was reassigned, and the guard was fired. It was then revealed that officials had failed to install security cameras in the tower, which facilitated Casquejo's entry to the site.|$|E
