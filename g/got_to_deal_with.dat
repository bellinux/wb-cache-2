500|$|In January 1930, Hergé {{introduced}} Quick & Flupke (Quick et Flupke), a new {{comic strip}} about two street kids from Brussels, {{in the pages}} of Le Petit Vingtième. At Wallez's direction, in June he began serialisation of the second Tintin adventure, Tintin in the Congo, designed to encourage colonial sentiment towards the Belgian Congo. Authored in a paternalistic style that depicted the Congolese as childlike idiots, in later decades it would be accused of racism; however, {{at the time it was}} un-controversial and popular, with further publicity stunts held to increase sales.

[...] In addition, Rater explained that Ellis' [...] "awful, raw, ugly and terrible" [...] statements towards her daughter were intended to make everyone realize the reason behind Meredith's alcoholism in college and her continuous one-night stands with inappropriate men.

In response to the scene that sees Ellis interacting with Webber, Rater wrote that it is the first time she lets her guard down, exposing the previously hidden vulnerability, which allows her express the desire to be as happy and ordinary as her daughter.

Party president Christopher Moriarty accused Evans of being [...] "piss-weak and gutless" [...] for not backing a business plan aimed at assisting the party out of its parlous financial situation. High-ranking party members were canvassing support for an urgent no-confidence motion in Mr Moriarty, with one senior figure quoted as saying that [...] "Moriarty is to the Liberal Party what Mark Latham was to Labor", but others counselled Evans against challenging Moriarty due to the high chance of failure. By late February, speculation over the opposition leader's future was being reported in the media, although he was expected to survive in the short term due to lack of options with 15 MPs remaining in the lower house. Initial reports suggested previous aspirant Martin Hamilton-Smith might challenge for the position, with Isobel Redmond as deputy.|$|R
2500|$|Idle {{was born}} in Harton Hospital, in South Shields in County Durham, to which {{his mother had been}} {{evacuated}} from the north west of England. His mother, Norah Barron (Sanderson), was a health visitor and his father, Ernest Idle, served in the Royal Air Force during World War II, only to be killed in a hitch-hiking accident shortly after the war. His mother had difficulty coping with a full-time job and bringing up a child, so when Idle was seven, she enrolled him in the Royal Wolverhampton School as a boarder. At this time, the school was a charitable foundation dedicated to the education and maintenance of children who had lost one or both parents. Idle is quoted as saying: [...] "It was a physically abusive, bullying, harsh environment for a kid to grow up in.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how the social psychology of U. S. pragmatists John Dewey and George Herbert Mead shapes how early U. S. sociology position itself {{on questions of}} U.

It focuses also on how pragmatist thought influences how 1920 s Chicago sociologists Robert Park and Emory Bogardus produced symbolic interactionist theories and studies on U. S. race and international relations. This paper makes several interventions {{in the history of}} U. S. sociological theory. It re-examines the history of U. S. sociology and the philosophy of pragmatism through the lens of empire, rather than simply a myopic looking-glass of the “race problem. ” This re-examination consequently highlights the interrelationships between racialistepistemologies and orientalist knowledges, rather than compartmentalizing empire and race, Asia and Asian America, sociology and philosophy. Further it draws attention to the ways pragmatism <b>got</b> deployed <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the “Question of the Philippines” in the interests of imperialism, even {{while at the same time}} pragmatism served as one crucial theoretical foundation for early U. S. anti-imperialist campaigns. These interventions are crucial as professional sociology in the U. S. commemorates its centennial beginning and assesses its many strengths...|$|R

50|$|By 1943, the German {{army was}} faced with various {{problems}} concerning their existing anti-tank gun designs. They had started the war with the 3.7 cm PaK 36, which {{had the advantage of}} being very light at 328 kg, so that it could be moved a reasonable distance by hand using only its own crew. By 1941, this gun was inadequate; it could not <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the heaviest armoured Soviet and British tanks. Its replacement, the 5 cm PaK 38, offered better performance (though still only marginal against the new threat) but, at 1,000 kg, was at the absolute limit of what the gun's own crew could effectively move into and out of a firing position by hand. The next gun, the 7.5 cm PaK 40, was a very effective tank-killer; but, at 1,425 kg, was no longer suitable for use by the infantry. A much larger crew and a vehicle was required to move this gun any distance at all and often just to displace it out of its firing position. Many were lost intact simply because they were overrun before their crews could move them. As the guns <b>got</b> bigger <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the latest tank technology, they became too heavy for tactical employment and more expensive. The PAK 36 cost RM 5,730 and took 900 work-hours to build, while a PAK 40 cost RM 12,000 and took 2,000 work-hours to build. The situation was so bad that, by May 1944, the 14th (Panzerjager) Kompanie of infantry regiments were having their heavy anti-tank guns removed and replaced by the Panzerschreck rocket launcher. But with an effective range of only 150 meters, this weapon did not provide the depth of fire required for the regiment's anti-tank defense. The only other alternative for a light anti-tank gun had been a recoilless weapon, but the German Army was less than enthusiastic because this type of weapon had many shortcomings, particularly its high demand for propellant.|$|R
