A {{large part of the}} success of Ford's Model T stems from the <b>innovative</b> <b>strategy</b> which introduced a large network of sales hubs making it easy to purchase the car.

Ford was always eager to sell to farmers, who looked on the vehicle as a commercial device to help their business. Sales skyrocketed– several years posted around 100 percent gains on the previous year.|$|E

According to Richard A. Gabriel, his tactics [...] "marked {{the beginning of}} the end of traditional Greek methods of war". His <b>innovative</b> <b>strategy</b> at Leuctra allowed him to defeat the vaunted Spartan phalanx with a smaller force, and his decision to refuse his right flank was the first recorded instance of such a tactic.* Gabriel, Great Captains of Antiquity, 9091 Many of the tactical innovations that Epaminondas implemented would also be used by Philip of Macedon, who in his youth spent time as a hostage in Thebes and may have learned directly from Epaminondas himself.* Bose, Art of Strategy, 8. Luraghi (The Ancient Messenians, 18) also notes that Philip also [...] "revived Epaminondas' strategy of mobilizing Sparta's neighbors".|$|E
