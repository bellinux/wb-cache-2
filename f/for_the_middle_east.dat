5|$|The men aboard Queen Mary were {{originally}} destined <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> but {{a decision was}} made mid-voyage to divert them to the United Kingdom, {{as part of a larger}} contingent of Australians that were sent to help bolster the defences there. After making the long passage via Fremantle, Cape Town, and Freetown, the Queen Mary arrived off the coast off Gourock, Scotland, on 16 June. The evacuation at Dunkirk had been achieved just two weeks earlier and France had just fallen: Britain was now preparing for a potential cross-Channel invasion. The Australian troops from the 18th Brigade and, eventually, the 25th Brigade, along with various supporting arms, had been despatched to help bolster the island's defences. From Gourock, they entrained and moved south to Tidworth Camp on Salisbury Plain. They remained in Britain for much of the rest of the year, undertaking training, mounting guard, conducting patrols and exercises. A move to Colchester took place in October to afford the Australians a more permanent barracks for the coming winter, as they were mainly under canvas at Tidworth. The following month, as the threat of invasion seemingly passed, they received orders to move to Glasgow to embark on the transport Otrango, bound <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> where they were to rejoin the rest of the 6th Division.|$|E

5|$|The {{physical}} standards {{under which}} the first contingent of the AIF was recruited were very strict, nevertheless {{by the end of}} August over 20,000 men had been recruited into one infantry division—the 1st Division—and one light horse brigade, the 1st Light Horse Brigade. Following a brief period of training in Australia, the force set sail <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East,</b> assembling off Albany, Western Australia, in early November 1914 before leaving Australian waters, with the 2nd Battalion embarked upon the HMAT Suffolk.|$|E
5|$|A {{short period}} of {{rudimentary}} training followed {{under the tutelage of}} members of the Australian Instructional Corps. This was completed by April 1940, and that month the battalion– under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Godfrey, a First World War veteran who had previously commanded the 23rd/21st Battalion– embarked <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> on the transport ship Neuralia, departing from Port Melbourne and sailing via Fremantle, Colombo, Aden and the Suez Canal. At this time it was attached to the 17th Brigade, which was assigned to the 6th Division.

5|$|After {{completing}} individual {{training at}} Ingleburn, the battalion moved on foot to Bathurst to complete collective training.
