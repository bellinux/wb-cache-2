Social media gave chances to people to choose {{the kind of person}} they wished to be <b>in</b> <b>social</b> <b>medai.</b> People could then construct their identity the same as or different from their true selves in the real world. This study aimed to identify and understand the self-presentation of social media users in the construction of identity in social media and identity in real life. The study was conducted through the methods of phenomenology and avatar research. Data was gathered by by in-depth interviews and observations in informants social media accounts. The results showed several findings, namely: construction of identity in social media take the positive part of identity in the real world, informants consistently set a certain image in the social media in match to their expectations, social media became a mean of users personal branding. Informants also divided into two categories: first, the group that consistently maintain the image they were trying to build. second, groups that occasionally appeared different from the image they wanted to construct...|$|E

40|$|Objective of the Study: The {{objective}} of the thesis was to explore how the case organization (Wärtsilä Corporation) strategically builds and manages its corporate brand <b>in</b> <b>social</b> media, with the focus on value co-creation of brand through stakeholder involvement in brand building <b>in</b> <b>social</b> media. The research questions consider three aspects: 1) the case organization's overall corporate branding strategy <b>in</b> <b>social</b> media towards different stakeholder groups; 2) {{the involvement of the}} case organization's prime external stakeholder groups in building corporate brand <b>in</b> <b>social</b> media; 3) value co-creation in brand building through the interaction between the case organization and its external stakeholder groups <b>in</b> <b>social</b> media. Methodology and Theoretical Framework: The research used a qualitative approach in a single-case study, and Wärtsilä was chosen to be the case company. The netnography method was used in data collection, which covered four months online observation <b>in</b> two <b>social</b> media channels. Additionally, qualitative interviews were also conducted. The theoretical framework constructed represents a shared space between the organization and its stakeholders <b>in</b> <b>social</b> media - a process circle of value co-creation <b>in</b> <b>social</b> media where communication, interaction, knowledge sharing, action, and stakeholder engagement occur and interact with each other. Findings and Conclusions: The findings supported various earlier studies in value co-creation of brand building. Wärtsilä effectively implemented the corporate branding strategy into its social media practice, and strongly reflected its brand core value <b>in</b> <b>social</b> media communication. The company enhanced value co-creation by involving stakeholders in building the corporate brand <b>in</b> <b>social</b> media through different ways. Most importantly, the findings identified four brand values: brand identity, brand reputation, brand loyalty, and brand satisfaction through the value co-creation process <b>in</b> <b>social</b> media. The implications suggest that {{it is important for the}} organization to have its corporate branding strategy align with the social media strategy, to actively interact and initiate dialogue with stakeholders <b>in</b> <b>social</b> media, and to also emphasize other brand values than the core value <b>in</b> corporate branding's <b>social</b> media strategy...|$|R

The predictions of a simple theoretical model are confirmed by an empirical analysis of Israeli Social Survey data for 2002 - 2006. The number of children has a U -shaped effect on parents' involvement <b>in</b> <b>social</b> networks, with substantial differences between fathers and mothers. The negative effect is dominant on the mothers' involvement <b>in</b> <b>social</b> networks, while the positive effect is dominant on the father's involvement <b>in</b> <b>social</b> networks. The age gap between children has a positive effect on both parents' involvement <b>in</b> <b>social</b> networks, while the age of the youngest child has a positive effect on the father's involvement <b>in</b> <b>social</b> networks.

40|$|Grouping users <b>in</b> <b>social</b> {{networks}} is {{an important}} process that improves matching and recommendation activities <b>in</b> <b>social</b> networks. The data mining methods of clustering {{can be used in}} grouping the users <b>in</b> <b>social</b> networks. However, the existing general purpose clustering algorithms perform poorly on the social network data due to the special nature of users' data <b>in</b> <b>social</b> networks. One main reason is the constraints that need to be considered in grouping users <b>in</b> <b>social</b> networks. Another reason is the need of capturing large amount of information about users which imposes computational complexity to an algorithm. In this paper, we propose a scalable and effective constraint-based clustering algorithm based on a global similarity measure that takes into consideration the users' constraints and their importance <b>in</b> <b>social</b> networks. Each constraint's importance is calculated based on the occurrence of this constraint in the dataset. Performance of the algorithm is demonstrated on a dataset obtained from an online dating website using internal and external evaluation measures. Results show that the proposed algorithm is able to increases the accuracy of matching users <b>in</b> <b>social</b> networks by 10 % in comparison to other algorithms...|$|R
40|$|This article {{reflects}} on theory <b>in</b> <b>social</b> work. With {{a starting point}} in the contemporary discussion of evidence-based social work, we {{raise questions about the}} role of theory. To understand empirical data, we need theory. The arena of social work is an open field for many academic disciplines, and theories used for understanding social work are mostly imported from general social science. Theory has to be built on an empirical base, and in order to be regarded as a social work theory this empirical base should come from social interventions. Therefore, the challenge for social work is to develop theories of its own. Theory development <b>in</b> <b>social</b> work could be in contrast to existing non-theoretical research and conceptual models without a base <b>in</b> <b>social</b> facts, as well as to prevailing perspectives <b>in</b> <b>social</b> work practice, such as reflective <b>social</b> work. <b>In</b> this article we sketch a model of the field of knowledge <b>in</b> <b>social</b> work and elucidate the multifaceted aspects that exist <b>in</b> <b>social</b> work. Finally, we argue for an awareness of the levels, or <b>social</b> domains, <b>in</b> <b>social</b> work practice {{on the one hand and}} the scientific explanations on the other hand...|$|R
