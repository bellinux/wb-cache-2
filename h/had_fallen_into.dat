5|$|As {{in much of}} the UK, Leeds' {{housing stock}} <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>into</b> {{disrepair}} {{by the middle of the}} 20th century. The city was overcrowded, and the Victorian terraces were unsuitable for modern inhabitation. Leeds had one of the most Labour orientated councils and in the 1930s pledged to replace 30,000 slums.|$|E

Mackanin's Sounds posted a losing record every month during the season and finished the year 16games behind first-place Buffalo with 65–78 record.|$|E
5|$|Loch Leven Castle <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>into</b> ruin by the 18th century, but {{the ruins}} were conserved and rubbish removed in 1840. The estate {{passed from the}} Bruces to the Graham family in the 18th century and then, in the 19th century, to the Montgomerys, who still occupy Kinross House.|$|E
5|$|The {{area and}} the {{surrounding}} chase were subject to forest law, as a Royal forest. In the early period, this would have meant harsh punishments for residents that poached livestock or encroached on other Royal entitlements. By Tudor times, royal lands had become used as commons and forest law <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>into</b> disuse.|$|E

5|$|Bristol sent three {{ships to}} the Royal Navy fleet against the Spanish Armada in 1588, and also {{supplied}} two levies {{of men to}} the defending land forces. Despite appeals to the Privy Council no reimbursement was made for these supplies. The corporation also had to repair the walls and gates of the city. The castle <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>into</b> disuse in the late Tudor era, but the City authorities {{had no control over}} royal property and the precincts became a refuge for lawbreakers.|$|E
5|$|By 1846, {{the station}} was already very busy, {{handling}} trains from Wigan and the south, Bolton, Fleetwood, Blackpool, Lancaster and the north, and Blackburn. There were no footbridges; passengers had to cross the lines escorted by station staff. North of {{the station was}} a network of goods lines {{around the end of}} the Lancaster Canal. The coal yards and sidings here continued to operate long after the canal <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>into</b> commercial disuse.|$|E
5|$|By {{the reign}} of George I, the May Fair <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>into</b> disrepute and was {{regarded}} as a public scandal. The 6th Earl of Coventry, who lived on Piccadilly, considered the fair to be a nuisance and led a public campaign against it along with local residents. It was abolished in 1764. One of the reasons for Mayfair's subsequent boom in property development was to keep out lower class activities.|$|E

5|$|By {{this time}} Townshend <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>into</b> depression, {{wondering}} if {{he was no longer}} a visionary. He was again at odds with Daltrey and Entwistle, who merely wanted to tour and play hits and thought Townshend had saved his best songs for his solo album, Empty Glass (1980). Jones' drumming style was very different from Moon's and this drew criticism within the band. Townshend briefly became addicted to heroin before cleaning up early in 1982 after treatment with Meg Patterson.|$|E
5|$|By this time, the fortifications <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>into</b> {{disrepair}} {{because the}} Swedish command {{did not pay}} much attention to these territories, and funds that were allotted for renovation were insignificant. In addition, the forts at Nöteborg and Nyenskans were considered sufficient to provide defense for the region. In 1702, however, some repairs were completed under the supervision of Captain L. Stobecks.|$|E

5|$|In Baghdad, {{given the}} lack of firm and public {{leadership}} by Mirza Yahya, the Babi community <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>into</b> disarray. Some Babis, including Bahá'u'lláh's family, began searching for Bahá'u'lláh, and when news of a man living in the mountains under the name of Darvish Muhammad spread to neighboring areas, Bahá'u'lláh's family begged him to come back to Baghdad. On 19 March 1856, after two years in Kurdistan he returned to Baghdad.|$|E

Later, as the surviving ponies were crossing the sea ice near Hut Point, the ice broke up. Despite a determined rescue attempt, three more ponies died. Of the eight ponies that had begun the depot-laying journey, only two returned home.|$|E

5|$|Tension {{came to a}} head on New Year's Eve of 1958, when Atlas {{ordered an}} all-out attack on Ryan. The battle left many dead, and the few sane {{survivors}} barricaded themselves away.

Some of the events described above are revisited and expanded upon in the downloadable expansion , which takes place in Rapture during the latter months of 1958 and leads up to Atlas' assault on Ryan's forces.|$|E
5|$|After the disincorporation, the {{commercial}} {{center of the}} former village was revitalized by artists and entrepreneurs, who purchased and restored Main Street buildings that <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>into</b> disrepair. Since the 1990s, Rosendale has hosted many street festivals. The former village has {{had a number of}} notable buildings, including four churches. Two notable bridges span the Rondout Creek in the village: a road bridge that carries Route32, and the Rosendale trestle, a former railroad bridge currently being renovated as a pedestrian walkway. Joppenbergh Mountain, named after Rosendale's founder, borders the village and has been the site of numerous ski jumping competitions and mine collapses.|$|E
5|$|At the time, the island's {{population}} {{consisted of}} about two hundred former pirates and several hundred fugitives who had escaped from nearby Spanish colonies. Rogers organised a government, granted the King's Pardon to those former pirates on the island {{who had not yet}} accepted it, and started to rebuild the island's fortifications, which <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>into</b> decrepitude under pirate domination. However, less than a month into his residence on New Providence, Rogers was faced with a double threat: Vane wrote, threatening to join with Edward Teach (better known as Blackbeard) to retake the island, and Rogers learned that the Spanish also planned to drive the British out of the Bahamas.|$|E
