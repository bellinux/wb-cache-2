5|$|John Rhys-Davies {{was asked}} to reprise his role as Sallah as a guest in the wedding scene. He turned it down as he <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> {{character}} deserved a more substantial role.|$|E
5|$|Tony Todd, {{who played}} Candyman in the 1992 film Candyman, was cast as {{mortician}} William Bludworth. Morgan initially wanted Todd {{for the role}} because he <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> deep voice would give the film an eerie tone.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} NSS, {{the pair}} learned that Seung-hee was their undercover scout agent. While the duo {{was surprised and}} somewhat hurt, Hyun-jun was angered the most as he <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> heart was toyed with. During a team celebration dinner, Hyun-jun confronted her alone and the two embraced the passion they have for one another. Afterward, the two maintained a secret romantic relationship without the knowledge of anyone.|$|E

A blank look came into his face.|$|R

5|$|After the Olympics, Evans {{returned}} to Arizona and resumed his studies. In 1985, he represented Australia at the World University Games in Kobe, Japan. The following year, {{he attempted to}} qualify for the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh after only ten days training. He made the qualifying time, but was omitted. Evans later stated that he <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> admission of having only trained for ten days had lowered his standing {{in the eyes of the}} selectors. As a result of being overlooked, Evans retired from competitive swimming.|$|E
5|$|He began {{drawing the}} comic book in early 2005 with {{traditional}} art tools such as Mongol pencils and brushes. He took great care while illustrating Elmer because he <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> earlier work, Wasted, was poorly drawn. To devote time to completing {{the comic book}}, he had to quit his job working for US comic companies. As a result, the period between 2006 and 2008 {{was one of the}} most financially difficult times of his life.|$|E
5|$|Lorne Michaels said The Land of Gorch {{characters}} {{had been}} created without {{a set of rules}} or boundaries to govern the storylines. He said he <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> writing staff {{would have been able to}} work more effectively if there had been more guidelines on the characters' behavior and function. Henson said he felt the type of humor being written for the show was tedious and unimaginative.|$|E
60|$|The doctor pushed 'em {{out of the}} way in a moment, {{and then}} 'e bent over Bill and <b>felt</b> <b>'is</b> pulse and looked at 'is tongue. Then he listened to his 'art, and in a puzzled way smelt at the bottle, which Jasper Potts was a-minding of, and wetted 'is finger and tasted it.|$|R

5|$|Sam Elliott as General Thunderbolt Ross: A four-star {{general and}} estranged father of Betty. Ross was {{responsible}} for prohibiting David Banner from his lab work after learning of his dangerous experiments. Elliott <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> performance was similar to his portrayal of Basil L. Plumley in We Were Soldiers. Elliott accepted the role without reading the script, being simply too excited to work with Ang Lee. In addition Elliot also researched Hulk comic books for the part.|$|E
5|$|Seaborg kept a daily journal from 1927 {{until he}} {{suffered}} a stroke in 1998. As a youth, Seaborg was both a devoted sports fan and an avid movie buff. His mother encouraged {{him to become a}} bookkeeper as she <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> literary interests were impractical. He did not take an interest in science until his junior year when he was inspired by Dwight Logan Reid, a chemistry and physics teacher at David Starr Jordan High School in Watts.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Knox {{sent the}} letter to the Queen Regent, he {{suddenly}} announced that he <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> duty was to return to Geneva. In the previous year on 1 November 1555, the congregation in Geneva had elected Knox as their minister and he decided to take up the post. He wrote a final letter of advice to his supporters and left Scotland with his wife and mother-in-law. He arrived in Geneva on 13 September 1556.|$|E

5|$|Within {{weeks of}} the {{election}} Barber was moved from the FCO to the Treasury to take over as Chancellor from Iain Macleod, who died suddenly on 20 July. Though they had never enjoyed an easy relationship, Douglas-Home recognised his colleague's stature, and <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> loss politically as well as personally. Some commentators have maintained that Macleod's death and replacement by the less substantial figure of Barber fatally undermined the economic success of the Heath government.|$|E
5|$|After {{stepping}} down as chairman, he was unanimously elected to an honorary position of president, a role he kept until 1894, {{and was named}} the first-ever life member of the League in 1895. The role {{was that of a}} figurehead with little actual authority, but he was used as a mediator to resolve league disagreements. In {{the second half of the}} decade McGregor's failure to attend many committee meetings led to criticism from John Bentley, his successor as president. Bentley's criticism achieved the desired effect; from 1899 until his health deteriorated in 1910, McGregor seldom missed a meeting. During this period McGregor was noted for his reserved nature. He was silent for large parts of committee meetings, but would contribute enthusiastically on the occasions he <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> input was necessary.|$|E
5|$|De Ferran was {{confident}} {{that he could be}} competitive and achieve a good result without having to worry about the championship. Da Matta <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> team had learnt more from the series previous race on a superspeedway which he believed would help him in California where he wanted to win. Having moved from 16th to eighth in the points standings with a victory in Laguna Seca and a second-place finish in Germany, Papis stated that he was focused on the race and hoped he would clinch his first victory in a 500-mile event despite having not managed to finish a race on a superspeedway in 2001. Bruno Junqueira was excited to race in Fontana and hoped that he could clinch his second victory of the year.|$|E

5|$|Horvath {{was born}} to Croatian {{immigrants}} in South Bend, Indiana in 1921; his family soon moved to Parma, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio. He attended Parma Senior High School starting in 1936 and played on the track, basketball and football teams until the 11th grade. He decided to switch schools because he <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> basketball teammates were not taking the sport seriously. Horvath's family relocated, and in 1938 he enrolled at James Ford Rhodes High School in Cleveland, one of Parma's rivals. Playing as a quarterback for the Rhodes Rams, Horvath guided the team to seven straight wins in 1938, but the team lost to West Technical High School {{for a chance to}} be the Cleveland Senate League's nomination to play in the city championship. He graduated in 1939.|$|E
5|$|It {{is often}} {{suggested}} that the Last Sonata, in B-flat major, is a farewell work in which Schubert faces his own death (somewhat analogous to the myths surrounding Mozart's Requiem); this is usually ascribed to the relaxed, meditative character which dominates the two opening movements. Death scenes are also associated, somewhat more explicitly, with the more tragic C minor Sonata; Charles Fisk, for example, mentions ghosts and a 'dance of death', in the outer movements. However, when judging from a biographical point of view, the notion that Schubert <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> imminent death {{at the time of}} composing the last sonatas is questionable.|$|E
5|$|Manstein {{did nothing}} to prevent the killing of Jews and other civilians in the areas where his units were operating, and in which his Eleventh Army {{actively}} participated. That Manstein {{was well aware of}} the Einsatzgruppen massacres is demonstrated by a 1941 letter he sent to Otto Ohlendorf, in which Manstein demands Ohlendorf hand over the wristwatches of murdered Jews. Manstein <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> men deserved the watches, since they were doing so much to help Ohlendorf's men with their work. Smelser and Davies note that this letter was the only time that Manstein ever complained about the activities of the Einsatzgruppen. Manstein later stated that he felt the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust was exaggerated.|$|E

5|$|Adams resented Hamilton's {{influence}} with Washington and considered him overambitious and scandalous {{in his private}} life; Hamilton compared Adams unfavorably with Washington and thought him too emotionally unstable to be President. Hamilton took the election as an opportunity: he urged all the northern electors to vote for Adams and Pinckney, lest Jefferson get in; but he cooperated with Edward Rutledge to have South Carolina's electors vote for Jefferson and Pinckney. If all this worked, Pinckney would have more votes than Adams, Pinckney would become President, and Adams would remain Vice President, {{but it did not}} work. The Federalists found out about it (even the French minister to the United States knew), and northern Federalists voted for Adams but not for Pinckney, in sufficient numbers that Pinckney came in third and Jefferson became Vice President. Adams resented the intrigue since he <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> service to the nation was much more extensive than Pinckney's.|$|E
5|$|Although 47 {{drivers were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier, {{according}} to NASCAR's qualifying procedure only 43 could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Drivers who recorded their lap times early in the session were at an advantage because the track was cooler and thus gave more grip. Edwards <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> car had oversteer during his run. Kyle Busch won the third pole position of his career {{with a time of}} 29.613 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by Edwards, who was 0.125 seconds slower and had the pole position until Kyle Busch's lap. Martin qualified third, Gordon fourth, and Mike Skinner fifth. Biffle, Scott Riggs, Earnhardt, Kurt Busch, and Sadler completed the top ten qualifiers. The four drivers that failed to qualify were A. J. Allmendinger, Joe Nemechek, John Andretti, and Sauter (who crashed at turn-two on his first qualifying lap). Burney Lamar withdrew from the race prior to qualifying. After the qualifier Busch said his team was aware of the car's potential which was displayed in Friday's sole practice session and the January test session; he was worried about his vehicle being very tight going into the first and second turns having been on the accelerator pedal throughout his fastest lap.|$|E
5|$|As {{introduced}} in Soulcalibur II, Necrid is a warrior who fought and defeated a former wielder of the cursed sword Soul Edge, and was {{pulled into the}} dimension where the sword's spirit, Inferno, inhabited. Instead of battling Inferno, he fled, and became trapped in the dimension for years. Warped physically and mentally by the dimension as a result, he escaped during the closing events of Soulcalibur, but quickly found that, without the dimension's energies, he experienced intense pain and would eventually die. Attacking travelers he perceived as enemies, he happened upon a fragment of Soul Edge and <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> pain dampened. Pursuing other fragments of the sword, he encountered Talim, who was also seeking them, and helped defeat the resurrected Inferno. His memories and sanity restored by the battle, Necrid closed {{the entrance to the}} void, trapping himself within.|$|E
