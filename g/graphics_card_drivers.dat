5000|$|Introduced in 1995 {{with the}} CyberVision64 {{graphics}} card (Phase5), CyberGraphX {{was the first}} RTG software to allow full true-colour screens for Workbench and applications - older solutions supported only 256 colours (e.g. Picasso) or a four-colour Workbench with some 24-bit windows (Retina). [...] CyberGraphX quickly eclipsed all older <b>graphics</b> <b>card</b> <b>drivers</b> and by 1995 was acclaimed as the best solution for displaying Workbench and other applications.

50|$|Some {{motherboard}} implementations, {{particularly among}} those with PCI to PCI-X bridges, have non-functional MSI support. The AMD-8131 and some ServerWorks PCI Express chipsets were {{among those with}} problems, at least under some versions of Linux. It has also been observed that some motherboards with Nvidia nForce chipsets have broken MSI support. As a result, when NVidia enabled the MSI support on their <b>graphics</b> <b>card</b> <b>drivers</b> for the first time, many users of the nForce-based motherboards complained of instability, what was eventually {{traced back to the}} MSI implementation of the motherboard. Users complained of errors ranging from relatively harmless unresponsive GPUs in Windows Vista and 7 that eventually recover, USB devices intermittently ceasing to work in Linux when the GPU is tasked with heavy workloads, to hard freezes, blue screens and kernel panics on both platforms. Later versions of drivers blacklist these platforms and will not activate MSI on them.|$|E
50|$|Mandriva Linux Powerpack was a 'traditional' {{distribution}} (in other words, {{one that}} comes with a dedicated installer, DrakX, which is first used to install the distribution to the hard disk of the computer before it is run). It is the main commercial edition of Mandriva Linux, and as such, requires payment for its use. It contains several non-free packages intended to add value for the end user, including non-free drivers like the NVIDIA and ATI <b>graphics</b> <b>card</b> <b>drivers,</b> non-free firmware for wireless chips and modems, some browser plugins such as Java and Flash, and some full applications such as Cedega, Adobe Reader and RealPlayer. It was sold directly from the Mandriva Store website and through authorized resellers. It was also made available via a subscription service, which allowed unlimited downloads of Powerpack editions for the last few Mandriva releases for a set yearly fee. It consisted of a subset of packages from the 'main', 'contrib', 'non-free' and 'restricted' sections of the master tree.|$|E
5000|$|PowerPC native Warp3D {{including}} new drivers for the Voodoo 3 (Avenger), Voodoo 4/5 (Napalm) and the Radeon 7x00 series of <b>graphics</b> <b>cards.</b> New <b>drivers</b> include single-cycle multitexture support (two simultaneous units on the Voodoos, {{three on the}} Radeon) with simplified and extended combiner modes, interleaved vertex arrays, up to 8-bit stencil buffer support (where supported by hardware), and more.|$|R
500|$|Concerns {{were raised}} {{that due to}} these changes, users {{would be unable to}} skip the {{automatic}} installation of updates that are faulty or cause issues with certain system configurationsalthough build upgrades will also be subject to public beta testing via Windows Insider program. There were also concerns that the forced installation of driver updates through Windows Update, where they were previously designated as [...] "optional", could cause conflicts with drivers that were installed independently of Windows Update. An example of such a situation occurred just prior to the general release of the operating system, when an Nvidia <b>graphics</b> <b>card</b> <b>driver</b> that was automatically pushed to Windows10 users via Windows Update caused issues that prevented the use of certain functions, or prevented their system from booting at all.|$|R

50|$|Some <b>graphics</b> <b>card</b> <b>drivers</b> have {{historically}} coped poorly with the EDID, using only its standard timing descriptors {{rather than its}} Detailed Timing Descriptors (DTDs). Even {{in cases where the}} DTDs were read, the drivers are/were still often limited by the standard timing descriptor limitation that the horizontal/vertical resolutions must be evenly divisible by 8. This means that many graphics cards cannot express the native resolutions of the most common wide screen flat panel displays and liquid crystal display televisions. The number of vertical pixels is calculated from the horizontal resolution and the selected aspect ratio. To be fully expressible, the size of wide screen display must thus be a multiple of 16×9 pixels. For 1366×768 pixel Wide XGA panels the nearest resolution expressible in the EDID standard timing descriptor syntax is 1360×765 pixels, typically leading to 3 pixel thin black bars. Specifying 1368 pixels as the screen width would yield an unnatural screen height of 769.5 pixels.|$|E
5000|$|Although Commodore {{planned to}} {{introduce}} retargetable graphics in future version of AmigaOS (4.0), {{the company was}} not able to deliver such solution before its demise. Third-party graphics card manufacturers were thus forced to create their own software layers on top of AmigaOS, incompatible with each other.Most of these early Amiga <b>graphics</b> <b>card</b> <b>drivers</b> shared common limitations: compatibility with current applications was maintained by opening Workbench (or also other application screens, also known as [...] "Workbench emulation") on the graphics card - usually in 16 (under AmigaOS 2.x) or 256 colours (under AmigaOS 3.x); full graphics card features like high-colour (15- or 16-bit) and true-colour (24- or 32-bit) display could be used only by applications directly programmed for such driver software. Earliest of these solutions like Grafexa and SAGE libraries were able to display only their own applications on the graphics card without any support for [...] "Workbench emulation". Examples of other drivers are EGS, Merlin/Domino, Omnibus, Retina (which should be able even to display Workbench in 24 bit colour), Graffity, Picasso, and ProBench. Of these, Picasso offered good compatibility with older applications, because most OS-compliant programs could be promoted to graphics card display, and relatively strong software support. [...] ProBench (by ProDev) was released as a new [...] "Workbench emulator" [...] for the old Merlin graphics card in 1994, and version 3 (1996) introduced 16 bit colour depth and compatibility with CyberGraphX.|$|E
40|$|High {{performance}} commodity {{components are}} available today to build clusters {{powerful enough to}} run high performance virtual reality applications. But cluster programming is time consumming and error prone. Virtual reality platforms that hide {{the complexity of the}} cluster architecture and provide automatic parallelization schemes are required. We present in this paper two open source softwares, Net Juggler and SoftGenLock. The association of these libraries makes possible to run a VR Juggler application with active stereo and multi displays on a commodity component PC cluster. Net Juggler turns a cluster running the VR Juggler platform on each node into a single VR Juggler image cluster. Application parallelization is transparent to the user. SoftGenLock provides software genlock and quad buffer page flipped stereo, without requiring specific hardware or <b>graphics</b> <b>card</b> <b>driver</b> source code. The performed tests show these softwares do no introduce a significant overhead. ...|$|R

5000|$|A video overlay device can be {{connected}} between the <b>graphics</b> <b>card</b> analog VGA output and the monitor's input forming a [...] "VGA passthrough". The device modifies the VGA signal and inserts the analog video signal overlay into the picture; {{the rest of}} the screen is filled by the signal coming from the <b>graphics</b> <b>card.</b> The <b>driver</b> software informs the video overlay device about the desired position of the video window on screen. Because of the much greater processing power of modern <b>graphics</b> <b>cards,</b> and the awkwardness of adding additional analog hardware signal processing path, this method is now little used.|$|R
50|$|The {{initial release}} of the new amdgpu-stack has been {{announced}} on the dri-devel mailing list in April 2015.

50|$|Computer games also rely on {{third-party}} software {{such as an}} operating system (OS), device drivers, libraries and more to run. Today, {{the vast majority of}} computer games are designed to run on the Microsoft Windows family of operating systems. Whereas earlier games written for DOS would include code to communicate directly with hardware, today application programming interfaces (APIs) provide an interface between the game and the OS, simplifying game design. Microsoft's DirectX is an API that is widely used by today's computer games to communicate with sound and graphics hardware. OpenGL is a cross-platform API for graphics rendering that is also used. The version of the <b>graphics</b> <b>card's</b> <b>driver</b> installed can often affect game performance and gameplay. In late 2013, AMD announced Mantle, a low-level API for certain models of AMD <b>graphics</b> <b>cards,</b> allowing for greater performance compared to software-level APIs such as DirectX, as well as simplifying porting to and from the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles, which are both built upon AMD hardware. It is not unusual for a game company to use a third-party game engine, or third-party libraries for a game's AI or physics.|$|R
50|$|In {{partnership}} with AMD, PC gaming community and game recording software maker Raptr have overhauled their client and have since re-branded {{it as the}} AMD Gaming Evolved client in conjunction with AMD's Gaming Evolved initiative in the PC gaming space. Out of the partnership, players who install and use the client while in-game can earn points to spend on digital items like games or computer hardware, chat with friends, keep their game library optimized, check for <b>graphics</b> <b>card</b> <b>driver</b> updates, stream their games to Twitch.tv and record gameplay of their own with a built-in GVR, a feature similar to Nvidia Shadowplay software in its own GeForce Experience software that allows users to define a custom buffer length in their game for retroactive game recording with {{the push of a}} button so no moment gets missed and users typically do not need expensive hard drive setups to record to. In late 2014, AMD updated the client to finally support the recording and streaming of titles using Mantle. As of its initial update into the client, the Gaming Evolved software is still the only software to officially support the recording and streaming of Mantle enabled games.|$|R
50|$|An {{approach}} to allow commercialization under some open-source licenses while still protecting crucial business secrets, intellectual property and technical know-how is obfuscation of source code. This approach {{was used in}} several cases, for instance by Nvidia in their open-source <b>graphic</b> <b>card</b> device <b>drivers.</b> This practice is used to get the open-source-friendly propaganda without bearing the inconveniences. There has been debate in the free-software/open-source community on whether {{it is illegal to}} skirt copyleft software licenses by releasing source code in obfuscated form, such as in cases in which the author is less willing to make the source code available. The general consensus was that while unethical, it was not considered a violation.|$|R
50|$|Their 6600 series {{currently}} has three variants: the GeForce 6600LE, the 6600, and the 6600GT (in order from slowest to fastest.) The 6600 GT performs {{quite a bit}} better than the GeForce FX 5950 Ultra or Radeon 9800 XT, with the 6600 GT scoring around 8000 in 3DMark03, while the GeForce FX 5950 Ultra scored around 6000, {{and it is also}} much cheaper. Notably, the 6600 GT offered identical performance to ATI's high-end X800 PRO <b>graphics</b> <b>card</b> with <b>drivers</b> previous December 2004, when running the popular game Doom 3. It was also about as fast as the higher-end GeForce 6800 when running games without anti-aliasing in most scenarios.|$|R

More advanced Compiz effects {{are available in the}} Synaptic Package Manager (i.e., Ubuntu repositories). In Karmic 9.10, a fresh sound theme replaces the default Ubuntu theme, with a reverberating melody at startup, and an occasional knock or ping from a button or prompt. Xfce (instead of Unity) is the default user interface.|$|R
5000|$|Enhanced Graphics System (EGS) was {{developed}} by Viona Development using the Cluster language (a Modula-2 derivative) for Piccolo and Spectrum graphics boards, supporting screen depths up to 24 bits. It requires a minimum of 2 MB RAM and 4 - 5 MB of hard disk space. [...] EGS was first presented with the EGS 110/24 card (GVP) at the World of Commodore/Amiga show in New York in April 1992. [...] It supported {{a broader range of}} <b>graphics</b> <b>cards</b> than other <b>drivers</b> and was seen by some Amiga magazines as the next RTG standard for Amiga, but its compatibility with most Amiga applications was limited.|$|R
5000|$|Some of the {{specific}} HSA features implemented in the hardware need support from the operating system's kernel (its subsystems) and/or from specific device drivers.

40|$|Determining {{the crystal}} {{structure}} parameters of a material {{is an important}} issue in crystallography and material science. Knowing the crystal structure parameters helps in understanding the physical behavior of material. It can be difficult to obtain crystal parameters for complex structures, particularly those materials that show local symmetry as well as global symmetry. This work provides a tool that extracts crystal parameters such as primitive vectors, basis vectors and space groups from the atomic coordinates of crystal structures. A visualization tool for examining crystals is also provided. Accordingly, this work could help crystallographers, chemists and material scientists to analyze crystal structures efficiently.
