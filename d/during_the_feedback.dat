In large part, this coincided with the popularity of both professional and consumer audio editing software. Software delays, in many cases, offer much greater flexibility than even the most recent digital hardware delays. Abundant system memory on modern personal computers offers practically limitless storage for the audio buffer, and the natural efficiency of audio delay algorithms has made the implementation trivial for delays offering shifting or random delay times, or the insertion of other audio effects <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>feedback</b> process.

This study investigates two types of positive feedback processing (monetary feedback and positive informative feedback), both compared to meaningless feedback, in PD patients and elderly healthy controls, using fMRI. in addition, positive informative feedback will be compared to monetary feedback to determine whether positive informative feedback is just as salient as monetary feedback. Healthy controls showed increased activation in <b>the</b> left putamen <b>during</b> <b>the</b> monetary <b>feedback</b> condition compared to both the positive informative and meaningless feedback condition, without an effect in the medial Prefrontal. Cortex (mPFC). In contrast, PD patients showed increased activation in <b>the</b> left putamen <b>during</b> <b>the</b> meaningless <b>feedback</b> condition compared to both positive feedback conditions. In addition, PD patients showed increased activation of <b>the</b> mPFC <b>during</b> both positive feedback conditions. This suggests that when confronted with positive <b>feedback,</b> <b>the</b> mPFC compensates for the striatal deficit. In conclusion, striatal activation was seen in healthy controls specifically <b>during</b> <b>the</b> monetary <b>feedback</b> condition. PD patients did not differentiate between both types of positive feedback. If PD patients are provided with positive <b>feedback,</b> <b>the</b> mPFC compensates for the striatal dysfunction. If however, PD patients are provided with meaningless <b>feedback,</b> <b>the</b> mPFC is less stimulated and the striatum becomes prominent. This study thus demonstrates striatal involvement in positive feedback processing and altered positive feedback processing in PD. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

We consider the Coordinated MultiPoint (COMP) system model with other-cell interference (OCI). We determine the feedback updating period which is triggered by the transmitters to enable the receiver to send the CSI. This updating period is function of the channel temporal correlation, available feedback bits, {{and the number of}} transmit antennas. An optimal updating period is derived such that it guarantees that the average signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) is {{greater than or equal to}} that of the conventional feedback scheme that does not adapt its feedback period to the temporal correlation. The numerical results show performance improvement in terms of overall capacity and feedback overhead reduction when comparing the proposed adaptive scheme with conventional feedback approaches.

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} numerical {{methods for}} solving large-scale saddle point systems which arise <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>feedback</b> control of flow problems. We {{focus on the}} Stokes equations that describe instationary, incompressible flows for low and moderate Reynolds numbers. After a mixed finite element discretization [23] we get a differential-algebraic system of differential index two [45]. To reduce this index, we follow the analytic ideas of Raymond [34, 35, 36] coupled with the projection idea of Heinkenschloss et al. [22]. Avoiding this explicit projection leads to solving a series of large-scale saddle point systems. In this paper we construct iterative methods to solve such saddle point systems by deriving efficient preconditioners based on the approaches of Wathen et al. [19, 42]. In addition, the main results can be extended to the non-symmetric case of linearized Navier-Stokes equations. We conclude with numerical examples showcasing the performance of our preconditioned iterative saddle point solver...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Adolescents with {{patellofemoral}} pain (PFP) do {{not comply}} with their exercise prescription, performing too few and too fast repetitions, compromising recovery. We investigated if real-time feedback on contraction time would improve the ability of adolescents with PFP to perform exercises as prescribed. Methods: A randomized, controlled, participant-blinded, superiority trial with a 6 -wk intervention of three weekly sessions of three elastic band exercises was undertaken. Forty 15 - to 19 -yr-old adolescents with PFP were randomized to real-time BandCizeri-iPad feedback on contraction time or not by a physiotherapist. The primary outcome was the mean deviation from the prescribed contraction time of 8 s per repetition. Secondary outcomes included isometric hip and knee strength, Kujala Patellofemoral Scale, and Global Rating of Change. Results: The mean deviation from prescribed 8 s per repetition contraction time was 1. 5 T 0. 5 s for <b>the</b> <b>feedback</b> group, compared with 4. 3 T 1. 0 s {{for the control group}} (mean difference: 2. 7 s (95 % confidence interval = 2. 2 - 3. 2, P G 0. 001).

Findings highlight two sets of beliefs: those based closely on trainers ’ personal experience or ‘experiential beliefs’, and ‘received beliefs’: those associated with widely-accepted progressive methodologies which trainers may be under social pressure to conform to.
