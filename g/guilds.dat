5|$|Artists and {{craftsman}} operated as corporations (<b>guilds)</b> {{rather than}} as individual business. Inscriptions mention <b>guilds</b> of weavers, oilmen, artisans, basket and mat makers and fruit sellers. A Saundatti inscription refers to an assemblage {{of all the people}} of a district headed by the <b>guilds</b> of the region. Some <b>guilds</b> were considered superior to others, just as some corporations were, and received royal charters determining their powers and privileges. Inscriptions suggest these <b>guilds</b> had their own militia to protect goods in transit and, like village assemblies, they operated banks that lent money to traders and businesses.|$|E
5|$|Merchants {{organised}} {{themselves into}} powerful <b>guilds</b> that transcended political divisions, allowing their operations {{to be largely}} unaffected by wars and revolutions. Their only threat was the possibility of theft from brigands when their ships and caravans traveled to distant lands. Powerful South Indian merchant <b>guilds</b> included the Manigramam, the Nagarattar and the Anjuvannam. Local <b>guilds</b> were called nagaram, while the Nanadesis were traders from neighbouring kingdoms who perhaps mixed business with pleasure. The wealthiest and most influential and celebrated of all South Indian merchant <b>guilds</b> was the self-styled Ainnurruvar, {{also known as the}} 500 Svamis of Ayyavolepura (Brahmins and Mahajanas of present-day Aihole), who conducted extensive land and sea trade and thereby contributed significantly to the total foreign trade of the empire. It fiercely protected its trade obligations (Vira Bananjudharma or law of the noble merchants) and its members often recorded their achievements in inscriptions (prasasti). Five hundred such excavated Prasasti inscriptions, with their own flag and emblem, the bull, record their pride in their business.|$|E

5|$|Seabirds {{evolved to}} exploit {{different}} food {{resources in the}} world's seas and oceans, and to a great extent, their physiology and behaviour have been shaped by their diet. These evolutionary forces have often caused species in different families and even orders to evolve similar strategies and adaptations to the same problems, leading to remarkable convergent evolution, such as that between auks and penguins. There are four basic feeding strategies, or ecological <b>guilds,</b> for feeding at sea: surface feeding, pursuit diving, plunge diving and predation of higher vertebrates; within these <b>guilds</b> there are multiple variations on the theme.|$|E

5|$|With few fixed {{structures}} in the main marketplace, the plain traditionally served as a public open space on days when the market was not operational. Before the Reformation in the 1530s, its main use was as a venue for religious festivals, particularly the annual procession of the Craft <b>Guilds</b> at Corpus Christi. Most public religious festivals were abandoned following the Reformation and the subsequent dissolution {{of many of the}} mediaeval <b>guilds,</b> and the leading event on Norwich's civic calendar became the annual inauguration of the mayor, which took place each May.|$|E

5|$|The craft <b>guilds</b> {{required}} {{relatively stable}} markets and a relative equality {{of income and}} opportunity amongst their members to function effectively. By the 14th century these conditions were increasingly uncommon. The first strains were seen in London, where the old guild system began to collapse – more trade was being conducted at a national level, making it hard for craftsmen to both manufacture goods and trade in them, and there were growing disparities in incomes between the richer and poorer craftsmen. As a result, under EdwardIII many <b>guilds</b> became companies or livery companies, chartered companies focusing on trade and finance, leaving the guild structures to represent {{the interests of the}} smaller, poorer manufacturers.|$|E
5|$|The most {{usual way}} in the 15th century for a patron to {{commission}} a piece was to visit a master's workshop. Only {{a certain number of}} masters could operate within any city's bounds; they were regulated by artisan <b>guilds</b> to whom they had to be affiliated to be allowed to operate and receive commissions. <b>Guilds</b> protected and regulated painting, overseeing production, export trade and raw material supply; and they maintained discrete sets of rules for panel painters, cloth painters and book illuminators. For example, the rules set higher citizenship requirements for miniaturists and prohibited them from using oils. Overall, panel painters enjoyed the highest level of protection, with cloth painters ranking below.|$|E

5|$|There are {{primarily}} two feeding <b>guilds</b> in Lepidoptera – the nectarivorous who obtain {{the majority of}} their nutritional requirements from floral nectar and those of the frugivorous guild who feed primarily on juices of rotting fruit or fermenting tree sap. There are substantial differences between the morphology of the proboscises of both feeding <b>guilds.</b> Hawkmoths (family Sphingidae) have elongated proboscises which enable them to feed on and pollinate flowers with long tubular corrollas. Besides this, a number of taxa (especially noctuid moths) have evolved different proboscis morphologies. Certain noctuid species have developed piercing mouthparts; the proboscis has sclerotised scales on the tip with which to pierce and suck blood or fruit juices. Proboscises in some Heliconius species have evolved to consume solids such as pollen. Some other moths, mostly noctuids, have modified proboscises to suit their mode of nutrition – lachrymophagy (feeding on tears of sleeping birds). The proboscises often have sharp apices as well as a host of barbs and spurs on the stem.|$|E

Around 1200 the first mayor was appointed.|$|E
