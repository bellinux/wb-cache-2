40|$|Amplifiers have a {{vital role}} in the {{applications}} of engineering and as well as a component of amusement devices for human kinds. Gain and output voltage swing depends upon the designing parameters of that amplifier. In these parameters, selection of operating point is a challenging task. Operating point is extracted from the DC characteristics of the amplifier. Also, the dc characteristic depends upon the amplifier’s gain, transconductance and drain resistance; which are mutually interdependent and have a perplexing relationship with the gate to source biasing voltage. The key factor is how to choose the value for <b>drain</b> <b>resistance</b> and biasing voltage to get the desired gain. In this paper a piece-wise linear approach has been developed to extract an optimum biasing voltage and value of <b>drain</b> <b>resistance</b> to achieve desired gain. It is elaborated using an example of single stage CS amplifier. Mathematical expressions have been developed to obtain the optimum biasing voltage and <b>drain</b> <b>resistance.</b> Keywords- Single stage single transistor amplifier; Biasing Voltage; Drain resistance; Optimum point; Output swing...|$|E

A major reliability concern {{in some of}} these devices is the degradation of the <b>drain</b> <b>resistance</b> that is observed when the device is electrically stressed for a long time at bias conditions necessary for power applications.

40|$|Abstract—A {{study of}} the effects of traps on the RF charac-teristics of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs is {{conducted}} using small and large-signal microwave measurements with deep-level optical spectroscopy. Different variations of the drain current swing are observed for illuminations of different photon energies. The time evolution of the current swing in transient measurements enabled to determine the optical transient time-constant and the equilibrium relaxation time-constant. The dependence of the S-parameters upon the illumination yielded results consistent with the variation of the drain current swing under illumination. A variation in the small signal transconductance and drain conductance was extracted at 2 GHz which presumably arises from the variation of the <b>drain</b> <b>resistance</b> under illumination.
