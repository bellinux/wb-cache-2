The analysis looked to identify the drivers that determine why packers resort to one method of procurement rather than other, or a combination of them; and to determine the methods that result in better packer economic results and plant management. The results show that there is no difference between using marketing agreements and custom feedyards, and that resorting to owned feedyards entails higher costs, using current values for feedyard feed and yardage and 2005 - 2009 average cattle prices. When different scenarios are assessed, custom feeding emerges as the most cost effective option, followed by marketing agreements.

40|$|Due to {{fluctuation}} in climatic conditions, {{the quality}} of pasture varies throughout the year under Australian feeding systems. Whilst the majority of beef and lamb are grass fed, short-term grain feeding (< 70 days) is a common practice under grazing systems, particularly in dry seasons. In previous studies, we have shown that total lipid content and functional lipid (polyunsaturated fatty acid) concentrations in lamb muscle can be significantly altered by dietary supplementation (1, 2). In this study we report the influence of grazing or short-term grain feeding (3 months) prior to slaughter on functional lipid components and major fatty acid classes in Australian domestic beef cattle. Rump steaks collected from beef cattle (Bos Taurus and Bos Indicus) raised in different sites in Queensland were used in this study. In each treatment, muscle samples from 15 animals were ground, homogenized, and replicate samples were analysed for the determination of fatty acid concentrations using C 23 : 0 as an internal standard. The effect of diets on muscle (rump) fatty acid concentration in Bos Taurus and Bos Indicus are shown below. There was no significant diet X genotype interaction observed except for conjugated linoleic acid (P < 0. 01) concentration.

However, interest in the associated environmental impacts and resource use is increasing and requires detailed analysis. In this study we conducted a life cycle assessment (LCA) to investigate impacts of the grain-finishing stage for cattle in seven feedlots in eastern Australia, with a particular focus on the feedlot stage, including the impacts from producing the ration, feedlot operations, transport, and livestock emissions while cattle are in the feedlot (gate-to-gate). The functional unit was 1 kg of liveweight gain (LWG) for the feedlot stage and results are included for the full supply chain (cradle-to-gate), reported per kilogram of liveweight (LW) {{at the point of}} slaughter. Three classes of cattle produced for different markets were studied: short-fed domestic market (55 – 80 days on feed), mid-fed export (108 – 164 days on feed) and long-fed export (> 300 days on feed). In the feedlot stage, mean fresh water consumption was found to vary from 171. 9 to 672. 6 L/kg LWG and mean stress-weighted water use ranged from 100. 9 to 193. 2 water stress index eq. L/kg LWG. Irrigation contributed 57 – 91 % of total fresh water consumption with differences mainly related to the availability of irrigation water near the feedlot and the use of irrigated feed inputs in rations. Mean fossil energy demand ranged from 16. 5 to 34. 2 MJ lower heating values/kg LWG and arable land occupation from 18. 7 to 40. 5 m 2 /kg LWG in the feedlot stage. Mean greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the feedlot stage ranged from 4. 6 to 9. 5 kg CO 2 -e/kg LWG (excluding land use and direct land-use change emissions). Emissions were dominated by enteric methane and contributions from the production, transport and milling of feed inputs. Linear regression analysis showed that the feed conversion ratio was able to explain > 86 % of the variation in GHG intensity and energy demand. The feedlot stage contributed between 26 % and 44 % of total slaughter weight for the classes of cattle fed, whereas the contribution of this phase to resource use varied from 4 % to 96 % showing impacts from the finishing phase varied considerably, compared with the breeding and backgrounding. GHG emissions and total land occupation per kilogram of LWG during the <b>grain</b> <b>finishing</b> phase were lower than emissions from breeding and backgrounding, resulting in lower life-time emissions for grain-finished cattle compared with grass finishing...|$|R

40|$|Several meat quality traits affect consumers’ overall {{purchase}} {{decisions and}} satisfaction with meat products, but color is the major factor affecting purchasing decisions. According to some researchers, tenderness {{is the most important}} palatability attribute in consumers’ overall eating experience. Case-ready packaging in the meat industry is growing at a rapid rate and generally includes modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) with specific gases. Advantages of MAP include use of a centralized location, improved sanitation control, more consistent products, and increased marketing flexibility. Packaging beef in highoxygen (HiO 2) MAP results in a desirable bright red lean color but can have detrimental effects on other quality traits, including increased off-flavors and decreased tenderness. Use of carbon monoxide (CO) has been approved by USDA and the Food and Drug Administration for use at levels up to 0. 4 % in retail MAP. Products in MAP that include CO have improved beef color stability and extended display time. Premature browning, originally discovered in ground beef, results when meat is cooked to temperatures lower than what is necessary to kill harmful pathogens but appears well done internally.
