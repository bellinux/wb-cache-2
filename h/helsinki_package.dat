It discusses preliminary estimates on the amount and purposes of environmental aid provided by donor countries in 1991. The paper discusses the commercial implications of other countries' aid for U. S. environmental firms, and the <b>Helsinki</b> <b>package</b> adopted by the OECD in late 1991 to limit commercial advantage from use of tied aid credits...|$|E
50|$|Harry Palmer (Michael Caine), who {{has left}} MI5 {{to work as}} a private investigator, is told by a {{mechanical}} voice on the phone to take a <b>package</b> to <b>Helsinki.</b> The <b>package</b> contains six virus-laden eggs that have been stolen from the British government's research facility at Porton Down. In Helsinki, he is met by Anya (Françoise Dorléac) who takes him to meet her handler, Harry's old friend Leo Newbigen (Karl Malden). Leo is in love with Anya, but Harry knows that she is only pretending to reciprocate. Leo takes Harry to a secret room where a computer issues daily instructions to Leo and Anya. The computer speaks in the same voice as the one which summoned Harry to Helsinki.|$|R

In order to disambiguate between the possible com-pound segmentations, a probabilistic strategy has been found effective by Lindén and Pirinen [7]. In this article, we present a method for im-plementing the probabilistic framework as a separate process which can be combined through composition with a lexical transducer to create a weighted morphological analyzer. To implement the analyzer, we use the HFST-LexC and related command line tools which are part of the open source <b>Helsinki</b> Finite-State Technology <b>package.</b> Using Finnish as a test language, we show how to use the weighted finite-state lexicon for build-ing a simple unigram tagger with 96 - 98 % precision for Finnish words and word segments belonging to the vocabulary. ...|$|R
