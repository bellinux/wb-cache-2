40|$|During {{the drying}} {{stage of the}} {{papermaking}} process, paper undergoes dimensional changes caused by fiber dehydration, but exhibiting uneven width reduction magnitudes along the cross-machine direction. The degree of cross-direction (CD) shrinkage can be very different at the edges {{when compared to the}} center of the web. The highest shrinkage amplitude at the web edges can vary according to the operation conditions and the drying section configuration, as well. The difference in the degree of CD shrinkage gives rise to adverse effects on the finished CD paper sheet properties, particularly strength and hygroelastic properties, which can vary many percents from the edges {{to the center of the}} web. Extreme property values lead to different problems, such as sheet differential dimensional instability, which can limit paper quality and converting efficiency, especially in high speed machines (e. g., multi-color offset printing and office copier machines). The issues considered above make clear the advantages of measuring and carefully analyzing the differential CD shrinkage profile of finished paper. This work reviews the CD differential shrinkage profile development in the drying section, its impact on finished paper properties and presents an accurate and low cost measurement method based on image analysis techniques, supported by digital processing through the two-dimensional Fast Fourier Transform (2 D-FFT). The experimental results show that image analysis applied to paper samples taken from the <b>jumbo</b> <b>roll</b> represents a reliable method for determining the differential CD shrinkage profile, and a practical tool for monitoring paper quality and evaluating its CD dimensional stability profile...|$|E

50|$|The {{one-dimensional}} cutting stock {{problem as}} {{applied in the}} paper / plastic film industries, involves cutting <b>jumbo</b> <b>rolls</b> into smaller ones. This is done by generating cutting patterns typically to minimise waste. Once such a solution has been produced, one may seek to minimise the knife changes, by re-sequencing the patterns (up {{and down in the}} figure), or moving rolls left or right within each pattern. These moves do not affect the waste of the solution.|$|R

40|$|The cutting {{stock or}} trim problem arises when <b>jumbo</b> <b>rolls</b> of paper are slit into reels of various width ("deckled"). The problem was {{examined}} {{as early as}} 1954; it {{is now seen as}} a classical Linear Programming formulation. The problem may be easy to formulate, {{but it is difficult to}} solve for genuine data. This is so not only because of the computations required to find good cutting plans. The major problem is this: such plans are based on certain data, but the data change as the plan is being executed and the plan no longer applies. So here it may not be optimal to optimise globally, but to work on a local heuristic basis. We can propose a heuristic procedure that compares well with an absolute solution and that can be used on a local basis. This heuristic is in use at Mondi Paper in Richards Bay...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a specific}} food item - the <b>Jumbo</b> Breakfast <b>Roll</b> [JBR] - through a sociological lens, {{in order to}} trace the factors that contributed to its rise to prominence in Irish food culture in the 'Celtic Tiger' period of the late 20 th/early 21 st century. It also examines {{the development of these}} factors in the period following the crash of the Irish bubble economy. It is argued that the JBR arose at the intersection of a number of key trends in the food technology, retail, transport, distribution and construction sectors. Yet the JBR also had its antecedents in established foodways and traditions. It reflects on how the JBR could be interpreted as a 'national dish' that symbolised a particular moment in contemporary Irish society, and raises the possibility that a sociologically-informed analysis of such emblematic dishes allows us to explore aspects of national society, culture and economy within a globalised world.
