40|$|Abstract—A {{quantitative}} {{model for}} interferogram data {{collected in a}} quantum-limited hyperspectral imaging system is derived. This model accounts for the geometry of the interferometer, the Poisson noise, and the parameterization of {{the mean of the}} noise in terms of the autocorrelation function of the incident optical signal. The Cramér–Rao bound on the variance of unbiased spectrum estimates is derived and provides an explanation for what is often called the “multiplex disadvantage ” in interferometer-based methods. Three spectrum estimation algorithms are studied: maximum likelihood via the expectation-maximization (<b>EM)</b> algorithm, least <b>squares</b> (LS), and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) with data precorrection. Extensive simulation results reveal advantages and disadvantages with all three methods in different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes.

40|$|The Fisher {{scoring method}} {{is widely used}} for {{likelihood}} maximization, but its application can be difficult in situations where the expected information matrix is not available in closed form or when parameters have constraints. In this paper, we describe an interpolation family that generalizes the Fisher scoring method and propose a general Monte Carlo approach that makes these generalized methods also applicable in such situations. With this approach, random samples are generated from the iteratively estimated models and used to provide estimates of the expected information. As a result, the likelihood function can be optimized by repeatedly solving weighted linear regression problems. Specific extensions of this general approach to fitting multivariate normal mixtures and to fitting mixed-effects models with a single discrete random effect are also described. Numerical {{studies show that the}} proposed algorithms are fast and reliable to use, as compared with the classical expectation-maximization algorithm.

40|$|Most {{problems}} in frequentist statistics involve optimization of a function {{such as a}} likelihood or a sum of <b>squares.</b> <b>EM</b> algo-rithms {{are among the most}} effective algorithms for maximum likelihood estimation because they consistently drive the likeli-hood uphill by maximizing a simple surrogate function for the log-likelihood. Iterative optimization of a surrogate function as exempli ed by an EM algorithm does not necessarily require missing data. Indeed, every EM algorithm is a special case of the more general class of MM optimization algorithms, which typically exploit convexity rather than missing data in majoriz-ing or minorizing an objective function. In our opinion, MM algorithms deserve {{to be part of the}} standard toolkit of profes-sional statisticians. This article explains the principle behind MM algorithms, suggests some methods for constructing them, and discusses some of their attractive features. We include nu-merous examples throughout the article to illustrate the concepts described.

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Designing {{spectral}} efficient, high-speed wireless {{links that}} offer high quality- of-service and range capability {{has been a}} critical research and engineering challenge. In this thesis, we mainly address the complexity and performance issues of channel estimation and data detection in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems over time-varying channels. We derive the probability density function (pdf) expressions of the condition number (i. e., the maximum-to-minimum-singular-value ratio, MMSVR) of the channel state information matrix of MIMO OFDM systems. It is shown that this ratio {{is directly related to}} the noise enhancement in open-loop systems and provides a significant insight on the system capacity. A decision-directed (DD) maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) channel estimation scheme of MIMO systems is derived. Error performance of a zero- forcing receiver with the DD MAP and perfect channel estimates is provided and compared. This scheme has a low complexity and can be applied to time-varying Rayleigh fading channels with an arbitrary spaced-time correlation function. We propose an iterative channel estimation and data detection scheme for MIMO OFDM systems in the presence of inter-carrier-interference (ICI) due to the nature of time-varying channels. An ICI-based minimum-mean-square error (MMSE) detection scheme is derived. An expectation-maximization (<b>EM)</b> based least <b>square</b> (LS) channel estimator is proposed to minimize the mean-square error (MSE) of the channel estimates and to reduce the complexity of the implementation. With the estimate of the channel and initially detected symbols, ICI is estimated and removed from the received signal. Thus more accurate estimation of the channel and data detection can be obtained in the next iteration. An EM-based MAP channel estimator is derived by exploiting the frequency/time correlation of the pilot and data sub-carriers. Performance comparison is made between the proposed schemes and the ideal case - time-invariant channels and perfect channel estimation. We optimize the data transmission by exploiting the long term correlation characteristics. The transmitted data is successively detected without an error floor in spatially correlated channels. The algorithms proposed in this thesis allow low-complexity implementation of channel estimation and data detection for MIMO OFDM systems over time-varying fading channels, while providing good error performance...|$|R
