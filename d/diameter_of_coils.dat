40|$|Nowadays, flexi-coil springs are {{commonly}} used in the secondary suspension stage of railway vehicles. Lateral stiffness of these springs is influenced by means of their design parameters (number of coils, height, mean <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> <b>coils,</b> wire diameter etc.) and it is often suitable to modify this stiffness in such way, that the suspension shows various lateral stiffness in different directions (i. e., longitudinally vs. laterally in the vehicle-related coordinate system). Therefore, these springs are often supplemented {{with some kind of}} rubber-metal pads. This paper deals with modelling of the flexi-coil springs supplemented with tilting rubber-metal tilting pads applied in running gear of an electric locomotive as well as with consequences of application of that solution of the secondary suspension {{from the point of view}} of the vehicle running performance. This analysis is performed by means of multi-body simulations and the description of lateral stiffness characteristics of the springs is based on results of experimental measurements of these characteristics performed in heavy laboratories of the Jan Perner Transport Faculty of the University of Pardubice...|$|E
40|$|Magnetic Nanoparticles Imaging (MNI) {{is a new}} {{imaging method}} which uses {{magnetic}} nanoparticles as the contrast agent. The superparamagnetism of ferro- and ferrimaterial allowed the particles {{to act as a}} temporary magnet when an external excitation is applied. The imaging is based on the reconstruction of the measured relaxation time (magnetorelaxometry) from the sample by SQUID sensors after the applied field is switched off. To date, the imaging method is still not applicable on human due to many undetermined parameters of the diagnostic configuration. The equation of the reconstruction is generally ill-posed due to the involvement of many parameters in the configuration. Hence, the optimization is required in order to eliminate the unstable parameters of this imaging technique. In this thesis, the study of excitation coils’ configuration has been conducted with manipulation of the number coils, arrangement of coils, <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> <b>coils</b> and the shape of coils. The results show that by increasing the number of coils will improve the correlation coefficient of the reconstruction. However, due to the limitation of the grid size, the size of the coils is another concerned criterion; hence, the total area of the coils in each grid must be smaller than the area of the grid. The correlation coefficients of the reconstruction with varying the coils diameters show an improvement with smaller coils diameter. This observation obeyed the algorithm of diameter optimization in this thesis. Besides, the examinations of the arrangement and shape of coils show that both these criteria are highly depending on the shape of the sample. Due {{to the size of the}} rectangular coils used in the simulation are basically larger than the circular coils, hence, better results are found in the circular coils. On the other hand, the examination of the possibility of applying particle swarm optimization (PSO) method on the coils diameter has been studied by constructing the algorithm of the magnetic field calculation. The results of the algorithm construction showed that the diameter element is a non-linear parameter, and it is not suitable to be used in PSO as this method only applicable for the element which poses a linear relationship between the element and the output of optimizatio...|$|E

40|$|Blood {{platelets}} have {{a characteristic}} discoid shape {{supported by a}} circumferential band of microtubules. Following stimulation by aggregating agents or foreign surfaces, platelets lose their discoid form, extend pseudopods, and undergo a process of internal reorganization. Randomly dispersed cytoplasmic organelles become concentrated in cell centers within rings of microtubules and masses of microfilaments. Questions have been raised about this process and its contractile nature by studies demonstrating that platelet microtubules dissolve within seconds after activation and reassemble several minutes later in new locations. Earlier investigations showed that Taxol, a microtubule-stabilizing agent, did not inhibit platelet shape change, internal transformation, secretion, aggregation, or clot retraction.
