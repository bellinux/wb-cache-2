Theorizing about {{the pros and cons of}} various incentive strategies lags even further behind real-world developments. The Politics of Positive Incentives in Arms Control poses the question of whether or not it is sensible to "buy" cooperation form critical states and examines various recent cases of nuclear non proliferation diplomacy, including experiences with Ukraine and North Korea. In exploring the conditions under which positive incentives are effective and efficient in resolving international collaboration problems, editors Thomas Bernauer and Dieter Ruloff and four other contributors draw on a vide range of empirical research.

The import of pineapples {{is going to}} be completely freed in a few years. The pineapple farmers are intended to change there products from as materials for canned pineapples to highly qualified fresh fruits. Nevertheless the pineapple farmers are getting older and the lack of farm labour becomes a severe problem. The pineapple producing areas in Okinawa are now declining quickly. The purpose of this report is to consider the effects of the liberalization on the pineapple farms in less favoured areas in Okinawa. The conclusions are summarized as follows; 1. Since the middle of 19502 ̆ 7 s pineapple farming had spread to the marginal area {{in the northern part of}} mainland Okinawa and in Yaeyama islands where now we can <b>difine</b> as “less favoured areas 2 ̆ 2. But the import liberalization of fresh pineapples has been swiftly going further since 1961, the import of frozen pineapples had permitted in 1971 and at last the import restriction of canned and juiced pineapples had been released in 1990. 2. The amount of pineapple production was rising since 1956 until 1966, but it has been decreasing since 1968. Although the efficiency of labour and the productivity of land were improved, the returns for farmers was not risen as much as the productivity. So the number of farms was decreased since 19802 ̆ 7 s. 3. Since the packing industry was supported by the government, the main products of pineapple farms in Okinawa has been raw materials for the packers. After the packing industry had declined, many small factories were closed or integrated into two main factories, then they are now going to reconstruct the marketing power of their products. 4. Pineapple industry in Okinawa is now changing its strategy to produce and sell pineapples as fresh fruits. But it 2 ̆ 7 s difficult for fresh pineapples from Okinawa to make inroads into the central wholesale markets, because a enomous amount of fresh pineapples are imported from Philippines at a low price. So the Federation of Okinawa Agricultural Coopratives had decided to sell their products directly to the comsummers or to the Comsummer 2 ̆ 7 s Coopratives. 5. 27 farms were picked up to make the interview research in Miyagi hamlet, Higashi Village. The analysis of the farms shows us that the aging stage has extreamly advanced, and there are few successors in those farms. In addition, there are a lot of abandoned areas, too. 6. The liberalization on the trade of farm products under the international economic situation will surelly result in the destruction of the economy of the less favoured areas. On behalf of the protection against the imported farm products, a new government support program for these less favoured areas should be estabileshed. 沖縄産パインアップルは琉球政府によるパインアップル産業振興法が 1959 年に制定されて以来, サトウキビとならんで沖縄農業の基幹作物になった. しかし, サトウキビが本土農業における稲作に匹敵する土地利用と生産額のシェアを沖縄で持ってきたのに対して, パインアップルは数...|$|E
