25|$|Yet {{there were}} too many {{prominent}} people who had been willing collaborators in 1430 that had changed their allegiance once Charles had regained Paris and Rouen that <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> lose for the proceedings against Joan to be reopened. They included men such as Jean de Mailly, now the Bishop of Noyon, who had converted to Charles' cause in 1443, but in 1431 had signed letters in the name of King Henry VI of England, guaranteeing English protection to all those who had participated in the case against Joan. An even greater obstacle was Raoul Roussel, archbishop of Rouen, who had been a fervent supporter of the English cause in Normandy and had participated in Joan’s trial, until he too took an oath of loyalty to Charles in 1450.|$|E
25|$|Watson {{then spent}} {{a very brief}} period selling sewing {{machines}} for Wheeler and Wilcox. According to Tom Watson, Jr., in his autobiography: One day my dad went into a roadside saloon to celebrate a sale and <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> drink. When the bar closed, he found that his entire rig—horse, buggy, and samples—had been stolen. Wheeler and Wilcox fired him and dunned him for the lost property. Word got around, of course, and it took Dad {{more than a year}} to find another steady job. Watson would later enforce strict rules at IBM against alcohol consumption, even off the job. According to Tom Jr.: This anecdote never made it into IBM lore, which is too bad, because it would have helped explain Father to {{the tens of thousands of}} people who had to follow his rules.|$|E

25|$|Completed in 1875, Old Main, a two-towered brick {{building}} {{designed in the}} Second Empire style, was the primary instructional and administrative building. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Its design {{was based on the}} plans for the main academic building at the University of Illinois, which has since been demolished. However, the clock and bell towers were switched at Arkansas. The northern taller tower is the bell tower, and the southern shorter tower is the clock tower. One legend for the tower switch is that the taller tower was put to the north as a reminder of the Union victory during the Civil War. A second legend is that the contractor accidentally swapped the tower drawings after having <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> drink. Although the southern tower was designed with clock faces, it never held a working clock until October 2005. The bell tower has always had some type of chime, initially a bell that was rung on the hour by student volunteers. Electronic chimes were installed in 1959.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the band}} broke up in 1970, their {{material}} {{continued to be}} circulated through reissues and compilation albums.

On the 1998 release of the album, [...] "Get Me to the World on Time" [...] was included as well. In Europe, the band's albums were re-released, with 1986 seeing the reissue of Underground, Release of an Oath, and, essentially The Electric Prunes's first greatest hits album, Long Days Flight. This was the first album to include their first single, [...] "Ain't It Hard", the non-LP track [...] "You Never Had It Better", and the first to be released on the compact disc format in 1989.|$|E

Stanley ridiculed the idea as [...] "Free Old Dog Ring," [...] and sometimes howled like a dog in speeches deriding the proposal. On another occasion Stanley, who <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> drink, vomited in front of the audience as Morrow spoke.

500|$|The {{band was}} signed to Reprise Records in 1966 and {{released}} their first single, [...] "Ain't It Hard", {{in the latter}} part of the year. Their first album, The Electric Prunes, included the band's two nationally charting songs, [...] "I <b>Had</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Much</b> <b>to</b> Dream (Last Night)" [...] and [...] "Get Me to the World on Time". With the appearance of their second album, Underground, the band was more free to create their own material. However, the original group disbanded by 1968 when they proved unable to record the innovative and complex arrangements by David Axelrod on the albums Mass in F Minor and Release of an Oath. Both albums were released under the band's name, the rights to which were owned by their record producer David Hassinger, but were largely performed by other musicians. Several of the original band members reconvened in 1999 and began recording again. The band still performs occasionally, although the only remaining original member is lead singer James Lowe.|$|E

500|$|Love, {{a racially}} {{integrated}} band headed by African-American musician Arthur Lee, {{was one of}} the most popular bands in the scene. [...] Their propulsive 1966 protopunk anthem [...] "7 and 7 Is" [...] became a staple in countless other bands' repertoires. [...] The Music Machine, led by Sean Bonniwell, employed innovative musical techniques, sometimes building their own custom-made fuzzboxes. [...] Their first album (Turn On) The Music Machine featured the hit [...] "Talk Talk". [...] The Electric Prunes were one of the more successful garage bands to incorporate psychedelic influences into their sound, such as in the hit [...] "I <b>Had</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Much</b> <b>to</b> Dream (Last Night)", whose opening featured a buzzing fuzz-toned guitar, and which appeared on their self titled debut LP. [...] Garage rock was also present in the Latino community of East L.A. The Premiers, who had a hit in 1964 with [...] "Farmer John", and Thee Midniters are considered prominent figures in Chicano rock, as are the San Diego-based, Cannibal& the Headhunters, who had a hit with Chris Kenner's [...] "Land of a Thousand Dances".|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{commercial}} failure of [...] "Ain't It Hard", Reprise Records {{was encouraged by}} the group's effort, and signed the band to a recording contract that left them under Hassinger's authority. Weakley departed the band after the single, {{and was replaced by}} Preston Ritter, and rhythm guitarist James [...] "Weasel" [...] Spagnola was recruited to make The Electric Prunes a quintet. Although the band was composing their own material, Hassinger called upon songwriters Annette Tucker and Nancie Mantz to write the majority of the group's songs. The new line-up recorded six demos at American Recording Studio and Leon Russell's studio. These mainly comprised cover songs and Tucker-Mantz compositions. According to Lowe, while at Russell's recording studio, [...] "Dave cued up a tape and didn't hit 'record,' and the playback in the studio was way up: ear-shattering vibrating jet guitar. Ken had been shaking his Bigsby wiggle stick with some fuzztone and tremolo {{at the end of the}} tape. Forward it was cool. Backward it was amazing. I ran into the control room and said, 'What was that?' They didn't have the monitors on so they hadn't heard it. I made Dave cut if off and save it for later." [...] The fluttering buzz sound was utilized for the opening to the Tucker-Mantz song, [...] "I <b>Had</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Much</b> <b>To</b> Dream (Last Night)", which also included a heavily-textured psychedelic guitar motif. The song was chosen to be released as The Electric Prunes' second single in November 1966. It peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached number 49 on the UK Singles Chart. The success of the single prompted immediate touring, and earned the group a promotional contract with musical equipment makers Vox. Williams recorded an advert, demonstrating the use of Vox's wah-wah pedal in early 1967, and the band was featured in magazines such as Vox Teen Beat.|$|E
