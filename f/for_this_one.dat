5|$|Cynesige, the {{archbishop}} of York, died on 22 December 1060, and Ealdred was elected Archbishop of York on Christmas Day, 1060. Although a bishop was promptly appointed to Hereford, none was named to Worcester, {{and it appears that}} Ealdred intended to retain Worcester along with York, which several of his predecessors had done. There were a few reasons <b>for</b> <b>this,</b> <b>one</b> of which was political, as the kings of England preferred to appoint bishops from the south to the northern bishoprics, hoping to counter the northern tendency towards separatism. Another reason was that York was not a wealthy see, and Worcester was. Holding Worcester along with York allowed {{the archbishop}} sufficient revenue to support himself.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Pablo Jayat {{and colleagues}} {{reviewed}} {{the members of}} the Akodon boliviensis species group, including A.spegazzinii, in Argentina. They could not find clear differentiation in either morphological or molecular characters between animals belonging to A.alterus, A.leucolimnaeus, A.spegazzinii, and A.tucumanensis, and consequently concluded that they all represent a single species. Although genetic variation is relatively high within A.spegazzinii, there is no clear geographic structure among haplotypes from different regions. The next year, Ulyses Pardiñas and colleagues concluded that A.oenos, which had formerly, and incorrectly, been placed in the A.varius species group, was in fact another synonym of A.spegazzinii. The proliferation of scientific names <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> species occurred because of the terseness of the original description of A.spegazzinii, and a lack of large samples and of appreciation of the substantial variation occurring within A.spegazzinii.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} reasons <b>for</b> <b>this,</b> <b>one</b> {{of which is the}} lax {{attitude}} some banks have adopted because of the years of “good times.” The potential for this is exacerbated by the reduction in the regulatory oversight of banks and in some cases depth of management. Problems are more likely to go undetected, resulting in {{a significant impact on the}} bank when they are discovered. In addition, banks, like any business, struggle to cut costs and have consequently eliminated certain expenses, such as adequate employee training programs.|$|E

25|$|A {{difference}} {{that is highly}} statistically significant can still be of no practical significance, {{but it is possible}} to properly formulate tests to account <b>for</b> <b>this.</b> <b>One</b> response involves going beyond reporting only the significance level to include the p-value when reporting whether a hypothesis is rejected or accepted. The p-value, however, does not indicate the size or importance of the observed effect and can also seem to exaggerate the importance of minor differences in large studies. A better and increasingly common approach is to report confidence intervals. Although these are produced from the same calculations as those of hypothesis tests or p-values, they describe both the size of the effect and the uncertainty surrounding it.|$|E
25|$|The next {{album was}} delayed {{for almost three}} years as the band {{was looking for a}} new record label after {{finishing}} their deal with Delerium. In the meantime, they launched Metanoia (1998), a compilation of improvisations recorded during the Signify sessions, some of which were later shaped into songs. Finally, they signed to Snapper/K-Scope and the album Stupid Dream (1999) was issued. The album was a departure in style from all their previous works, in favour a more song-oriented direction, as a consequence this alienated some older fans but brought a lot of new ones. Its follow-up, Lightbulb Sun (2000), assured the fan base and solidified the ground of its predecessor. <b>For</b> <b>this</b> <b>one,</b> they worked with Dave Gregory of XTC, who provided string arrangements. A collection of EP tracks and out-takes from the previous two albums was launched a year after under the title of Recordings (2001).|$|E
25|$|As for the towers, {{they are}} presumed {{to have been}} added last, with the {{southern}} tower being earlier than the northern one, since they share a wall that manifestly belongs to the former. This, however, throws their identification, respectively as the towers of Isaac Angelos and Anemas, in confusion, since the Tower of Anemas is recorded as extant already {{in the first years}} of the 12th century, more than 70 years before the construction of the Tower of Isaac Angelos. Various hypotheses have been introduced to account <b>for</b> <b>this.</b> <b>One</b> theory is that their traditional identification is reversed, or that together they constitute the same building under different names. Another proposes that the actual Tower of Anemas lay further north and was one of the towers of the wall of Heraclius. All theories, however, contain various problems, and the traditional identification remains in standard use today.|$|E

25|$|A January 1917 paper, {{probably}} {{drafted by}} Macdonogh, argued that, with a compromise peace leaving Germany {{in control of}} the Balkans increasingly likely, Britain should protect her Empire by capturing Aleppo, which would make Turkey’s hold on Palestine and Mesopotamia untenable. Aleppo could be more easily reached from Palestine than from Mesopotamia, provided Murray had 9–10 infantry divisions, and it was argued that the Turks would have problems assembling 100,000 men to defend it. This paper was much more optimistic than Robertson’s later views, but at this stage Russia was still pinning down many Turkish troops. When consulted, the Admiralty were less enthused about suggestions that the Royal Navy assist with amphibious landings in Palestine. Except <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> “very secret” memorandum (sent to ministers 22 February 1917) Robertson tried to keep all his discussions of plans against the Turks verbal. It was agreed to build up Murray’s forces to 6 infantry divisions and 2 mounted divisions by the autumn, as well 16 Imperial Camel Companies and possibly some Indian cavalry from France.|$|E
25|$|King Philip IV of France, {{deeply in}} {{debt to the}} Templars, {{was in favor of}} merging the Orders under his own command, thereby making himself Rex Bellator, or War King. Molay, however, {{rejected}} the idea. Philip was already at odds with the papacy, trying to tax the clergy, and had been attempting to assert his own authority as higher than that of the Pope. <b>For</b> <b>this,</b> <b>one</b> of Clement's predecessors, Pope Boniface VIII, had attempted to have Philip excommunicated, but Philip then had Boniface abducted and charged with heresy. The elderly Boniface was rescued, but then died of shock shortly thereafter. His successor Pope Benedict XI did not last long, dying in less than a year, possibly poisoned via Philip's councillor Guillaume de Nogaret. It took a year to choose the next Pope, the Frenchman Clement V, who was also under strong pressure to bend to Philip's will. Clement moved the Papacy from Italy to Poitiers, France, where Philip continued to assert more dominance over the Papacy and the Templars.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in Radiohead's Oxford studio, Godrich's studio in Covent Garden, and Yorke's home. Yorke wanted to [...] "approach and engage with computers and not a lot else, and yet still have lots of life and energy in the music." [...] To generate ideas, he cut and pasted clips at random from Radiohead's library of original samples, {{many of which were}} created on laptops in hotel rooms as the band toured. He would send sound fragments to Godrich, who identified passages that could become songs, edited them, and returned them to Yorke. Describing the collaborative process, Yorke said: [...] "'Black Swan', back in the day, was a ... nine-minute load of bollocks. Except <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> juicy bit, and [...] goes past and goes, 'That bit. Fuck the rest.' Usually it's something like that." ...|$|E

500|$|... "A Town Called Mercy" [...] and the {{previous}} episode, [...] "Dinosaurs on a Spaceship", were the first episodes to be produced for the seventh series, and both were directed by Saul Metzstein. The two episodes are Metzstein's first Doctor Who credits. Much of the episode was filmed around the desert area of Almería, Spain, where studios have built Wild West-style streets {{that have been used}} in the making of over 100 Western-set films, such as A Fistful of Dollars. Filming the episode in Spain was cheaper than constructing a set in the UK. Moffat stated, [...] "We knew from the start we need some serious location shooting <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>one,</b> and given the most iconic American setting imaginable, there was only one place to go– Spain." [...] They reportedly filmed there from 8 March to 17 March 2012. Filming took place at Oasys/Mini Hollywood, and Fort Bravo/Texas Hollywood. While Smith was allowed to try riding the horse, most of the action shown in the episode was done by his stuntman. Composer Murray Gold mimicked Western-style scores when creating the music for the episode.|$|E

The gameplay was often compared to Baldur's Gate, another Interplay game that used the same engine as Planescape: Torment. Robert Mayer of Computer Games Magazine commented that [...] "this is one dark and interesting game. There's lots of macabre humor, some rather deviant sexual references, and enough weirdness to send the devotees of Tolkienesque fantasy running for their copies of The Hobbit." [...] Kieron Gillen of PC Gamer UK commented that [...] "Planescape: Torment is attempting to be iconoclastic in the most stereotyped of genres. We’re cheering it on." ...|$|E
