40|$|Abstract. Gamma-valerolactone (GVL) {{represents}} a promising future source for both fuel alternatives and renewable materials. It can be formed from the hydrogenation of levulinic acid (LA). However, when lower cost unprocessed biomass is utilized to form levulinic and formic acid, {{other organic compounds}} are created, primarily from the hemicelluloses portion. Therefore a two-stage conversion process was designed starting with a mild acid extraction to remove {{the majority of the}} pentoses while maintaining the hexose sugars in a solid form utilizing previously described optimized conditions. Mild sulfuric acid extraction experiments on hybrid poplar samples were performed and optimized. The resulting <b>hexosan</b> enriched biomass was then subjected to a series of experiments employing high sulfuric acid and temperature to form LA and FA with yield of over 60 % achieved. Finally, the LA and FA were catalytically converted to GVL, which could be purified through solvent extraction with nearly 100 % conversion achieved...|$|E
40|$|As the {{worldwide}} production of palm oil (Elaeis guineensis) is increasing, concomitant wastes of unutilized {{parts of the}} oil palm are also increasing. Thus, effective utilization of these wastes is expected. In this paper, therefore, the chemical composition of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and other minor cell wall components was studied for six different anatomical parts of the oil palm such as trunk, frond, mesocarp, endocarp (shell), kernel cake and empty fruit bunch (EFB). As a result, it was shown that cellulose is in a range between 20 - 40 wt% with hemicellulose being 10 - 35 wt%, whereas lignin in a range between 23 - 52 wt%. More in detail, the shell contained the highest lignin about 52 wt% but the kernel cake no lignin, while the rest in a range between 23 - 35 wt%, being composed of guaiacyl and syringyl moieties without p-hydroxyphenyl propane residue. This {{is very similar to}} the hardwood-type lignin, rather than softwood-type lignin. On hemicellulose, mannan was rich in kernel cake, while glucuronoxylan rich in the other parts, with 1. 8 - 8. 5 xyloses per one uronic acid. Consequently, oil palm is not a good material for ethanol fermentation by yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) because of high pentosan and low <b>hexosan</b> contents. As a minor component, inorganic constituents were also studied from the ash by scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDXA). As a result, K, Si, Na, Ca, S, P and Mg were found as elements {{in all parts of the}} oil palm studied. Particularly, Si and K were abundant in the trunk, shell, mesocarp and kernel cake, while the frond and kernel cake contained, respectively, K, Ca and P in a large quantity. The elements of Cl, Fe and Al were, however, detected only in some parts. These elements found are important and prerequisite for the healthy growth of the oil palm. Therefore, it may be concluded that, upon the whole utilization of the oil palm, inorganic constituents found in this study must be returned to the plantation site. These lines of information are useful for the efficient utilization of the whole parts of the oil palm which is necessary for the sustainable development of the biomass resources...|$|E

40|$|The capsular {{mucilage}} of {{the seeds}} was extd. in 7 % yield. It is partly O-acetylated (OAc, 4. 0 %) and contains lipids (free 24 % and bound 5 %). The mucilage is composed of D-glucose, D-galactose, D-mannose, L-arabinose, D-xylose, and L-rhamnose in the approx. ratio 8 : 5 : 2 : 1 : 1 : 2 and uronic acids (8. 15 %). The uronic acids were identified as D-galacturonic and D-mannuronic acids. The mucilage was fractionated into an acid-sol. fraction, which was significantly acetylated (OAc, 6. 6 %) and rich in uronic acids (34. 4 %) and pentosans, and an acid-insol. fraction rich in <b>hexosans.</b> The latter on further fractionation with alkali gave a glucomannan with glucose and mannose in the ratio 10 : 3, and a galactoglucomannan with galactose, glucose, and mannose in the ratio 2 : 4 : 1. Thus the mucilage is heterogeneous, contg. at least 3 different polysaccharides, and is comparable to cellulose-contg. seed mucilages and acidic bacterial polysaccharides. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|R
40|$|Three {{hemicelluloses}} {{have been}} isolated tram {{the wood of}} Engelmann spruce, an important western pulpwood species. Alter removal of the lignin, fractional extractions and precipitations with aqueous alkali gave an arabinoglucuronoxylan (8 % of the wood), a galactoglucomannan (2 %) and a glucomannan (8 %). Their structure {{was determined by the}} classical methylation method, by oxidation with periodate and by identification of the oligosaccharides obtained on partial acid hydrolysis of the polysaccharides. The xylan consisted of B-(1 [...] > 4) -linked D-xylose residues carrying a-(1 [...] > 2) linked 4 - 0 -ethylglucuronic acid and a-(1 [...] > 3) -linked L-arabinofuranose side chains. The two <b>hexosans</b> contained a framework of B-(1 [...] > 4) -linked D-glucose and D-mannose residues to which were attached a-(1 [...] > 6) -linked D-galactopyranose residues. Both hemicelluloses contained glucose and mannose in a ratio of 1 : 3 but the galactoglucomannan possessed ten times more galactose side chains than the glucomannan. An oligosaccharide giving equimolar amounts of galactose, glucose, and mannose on hydrolysis was obtained from the galactoglucomannan. This constituted the first unequivocal evidence for the triheteropolymer nature of this type of wood polysaccharide...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: An {{investigation}} {{was made of}} the processes occurring during the ensiling of sugar-beet pulp. Pulp was enclosed in rubber bags buried in a silo to obtain the same conditions of pressure and temperature as prevail in the silo itself. An outlet from the bags was provided for the measurement of evolved gases and seepage. Pulp alone was compared with pulp + 4 yo molasses. The process was followed by withdrawing bags at short intervals, and making bacteriological and chemical examinations of the contents. The addition of molasses resulted in a pure lactic acid fermentation of the sucrose with very small losses in dry matter. Few butyric acid bacteria were found. Where molasses was not added a vigorous butyric acid fermentation of <b>hexosans</b> and pentosans occurred, resulting in 12 - 15 yo loss of dry matter due to seepage and formation of CO,, the number of butyric acid bacteria rising to 10 g-lOIO/g. silage. The initial flora of lactic bacteria consisted of Betacoccus arabinosaceus Orla Jensen, which was soon displaced by Streptobacterium plantarum and 8. cmei Orla Jensen. After 2 - 3 months only Betabacterium breve Orla Jensen was found...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of fermentable sugar solutions for bioethanol production is optimized. The process of acid hydrolysis using dilute H 2 SO 4 was selected. Suitable lignocellulosics which are {{abundant in the}} Mediterranean (corn stover, hardwood and wheat straw) were investigated, and therefore their exploitation could be economically feasible. The process was studied in the two most common hydrolyzators (batch and continuous stirred) by developing a specific simulator for different raw materials. The simulation was applied {{in a wide range}} of temperatures (100 – 240 °C) and acid concentrations (0. 5 – 3. 0 % w/w), in order to optimize the productivity of fermentable pentosans and <b>hexosans.</b> It was confirmed that the {{production of}} sugar-rich solutions required a two-stage process; in the first stage the degradation of sugars takes place, since pentoses are formulated under milder conditions than hexoses; in the second stage of simulation, a variety of samples with high sugar concentration and low degradation products are tested. The xylose productivity ranges between 85 – 95 % under the most optimal conditions compared to the theoretical values, while large variations in glucose were frequent (10 – 55 %) in comparison with the theoretical values. The best theoretical results were achieved for wheat straw hydrolysis in a batch reactor...|$|R
40|$|The term “Hemicellulose” {{is applied}} to the cell-wall {{constituents}} extracted from plant tissues by cold 4 % sodium hydroxide, after preliminary extractions with cold water and 0. 5 % ammonium oxalate to remove pectic substances and water-soluble materials. The originator of the name was Schultze who, in 1891 and succeeding years, isolated there substances from a number of plant materials by extraction with dilute alkali and precipitation with acid. He observed that they were far more susceptible to dilute acid hydrolysis than cellulose, and believed them to be in some way related to cellulose, probably as intermediates in its formation. Although the eludication of the structure of cellulose and the analysis of hemicellulose have shown that there is little foundation for this belief, the name “hemicellulose” still persists. Hemicelluloses are polysaccharides which generally contain uronic acid. One of the few well-authenticated true <b>hexosans</b> that may be removed by alkali from the cell-wall of a higher plant is the mannan of the ivory nut. When dried by alcohol, hemicellulose preparations are obtained as fine, white or cream, amorphous powders; whereas, if dried from water, they form an extremely hard, horny mass, which will redissolve only with difficulty even if finely ground. The hemicelluloses are optically active, and usually more or less strongly laevo-rotatory. The majority of hemicellulose preparations give either no colour or a slightly greenish colour with iodine. The hemicellulose “A” of black-locust and of English oak sap-woods, precipitated by hydrochloric acid, was found to give a strong blue colouration with iodine. Anderson (1940) found that those hemicelluloses which are coloured by iodine solution usually give some d-glucose along with d-xylose in the products of hydrolysis. O’Dwyer suggests that in these hemicelluloses, anhydro-glucose units form a part of the molecule. It is more probable however, that they are derived from starch associated with it...|$|R
