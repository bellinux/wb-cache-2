60|$|There fell a long silence. At length Sir Oliver spoke <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|E
60|$|MRS. COADE (<b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>voice).</b> You seem to {{have been}} quite happy as an old bachelor, dear.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The Signora's nephew,' he explained, briefly, curtly, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>voice.</b> It {{was as if}} he were ashamed, or {{too deeply}} chagrined.|$|E
50|$|Manning {{also appears}} in Hellboy Animated: Blood & Iron <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> role, <b>voiced</b> by Jim Cummings.|$|R
6000|$|Hadrian sat still, {{having his}} own thoughts. Then <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> quiet <b>voice,</b> {{as if he}} were {{speaking}} from inside himself, he said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Nothing important,” Churchill echoed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> faint, <b>small</b> <b>voice.</b> Then {{he spoke}} with decision: “Louis, what’s in that bag? I want to know.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you think," [...] {{she asked}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>voice</b> {{and with the}} {{hesitation}} of one whom no refusal can surprise; [...] "you could give me a cup of tea?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Next evening Phil varied his tactics {{by coming}} to dinner early, just {{touching}} Una's {{hand as she}} was going into the dining-room, and murmuring <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>voice,</b> [...] "I've been thinking {{so much of the}} helpful things you said last evening, Miss Golden." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps it is best," [...] he said, at length, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>voice.</b> He {{turned to}} Mme. de Plougastel. [...] "If a wrong I {{have to admit}} in my life, a wrong that I must bitterly regret, it is the wrong that I have done to you, my dear..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing important," [...] Churchill echoed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> faint, <b>small</b> <b>voice.</b> Then {{he spoke}} with decision: [...] "Louis, what's in that bag? I want to know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Before {{we discuss}} that," [...] he said <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> quiet <b>voice,</b> [...] "let us {{go into a}} private room. I have {{something}} very particular to say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It—it {{sounded like}} Jackson," [...] murmured the {{intruder}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> modest <b>voice.</b> [...] "It {{might have been}} Blackson, or Dackson, or even Snackson—I won’t swear to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{enjoy it}} very much," [...] said Prothero <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>voice</b> after an {{interval}} for reflection. [...] "I wonder where we shall fly. It will do us both {{a lot of}} good. And I shall insure my life for a small amount in my mother's interest.... Benham, I think I will, after all, take a whiskey.... Life is short...." ...|$|E
6000|$|About a {{week after}} this lady's quick sympathies had enlisted {{themselves}} with Mr. Rosier, Isabel, going rather late to dress for dinner, found Pansy sitting in her room. The girl {{seemed to have been}} awaiting her; she got up from her low chair. [...] "Pardon my taking the liberty," [...] she said <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>voice.</b> [...] "It will be the last--for some time." ...|$|E
60|$|Such was {{the aspect}} of out-of-doors affairs, when Mrs. Corney, the matron of the workhouse to which our readers have been already {{introduced}} as the birthplace of Oliver Twist, sat herself down before a cheerful fire in her own little room, and glanced, with no small degree of complacency, at a small round table: on which stood a tray of corresponding size, furnished with all necessary materials for the most grateful meal that matrons enjoy. In fact, Mrs. Corney was about to solace herself {{with a cup of}} tea. As she glanced from the table to the fireplace, where the smallest of all possible kettles was singing a small song <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>voice,</b> her inward satisfaction evidently increased,--so much so, indeed, that Mrs. Corney smiled.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Grandfather Frog, {{here they}} are," [...] said Danny Meadow Mouse, still <b>in</b> <b>a</b> very <b>small</b> <b>voice.</b> Then he gave Grandfather Frog the four fat, foolish, green flies.|$|R
6000|$|... 'As {{a matter}} of fact,' he said, <b>in</b> rather <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>voice,</b> 'I believe that is Hermione come now, with Gerald Crich. She {{wanted to see the}} rooms before they are furnished.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{looked at}} him in wide-eyed wonder. [...] "You are going away from me?" [...] she asked <b>in</b> <b>a</b> very <b>small</b> <b>voice.</b> [...] "You are going away from Co-Tan?" ...|$|R
60|$|First, {{strutting}} {{with slow}} and solemn steps, {{with one hand}} laid pathetically on the breast of his clerical waistcoat, appeared Reverend Finch. After him, came his wife, shorn of all her proper accompaniments--except the baby. Without her novel, without her jacket, petticoat, or shawl, without even the handkerchief which she was always losing--clothed, {{for the first time}} in my experience, in a complete gown--the metamorphosis of damp Mrs. Finch was complete. But for the baby, I believe I should have taken her, in the dim light, for a stranger! She stood (apparently doubtful of her reception) hesitating in the doorway, and so hiding a third member of the deputation--who appealed piteously to the general notice <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>voice</b> which I knew well, and in a form of address familiar to me from past experience.|$|E
60|$|It is {{not true}} there is no caste in England. The mark of the high castes, such as Ul or Baharun [Earl or Baron] {{is that they can}} perform any office, such as {{handling}} the dead, wounds, blood, etc., without loss of caste. The Maharanee of the Nurses in the English Hospital which is near our Hospital is by caste Baharanee [Baroness]. I resort thither daily for society and enlightenment on the habits of this people. The high castes are forbidden to show curiosity, appetite, or fear in public places. In this respect they resemble troops on parade. Their male children are beaten from their ninth year to their seventeenth year, by men with sticks. Their women are counted equal with their men. It is reckoned as disgraceful for a Baharanee to show fear when lights are extinguished in the hospital on account of bomb-dropping air-ships, as for an Ul to avoid battle. They do not blacken each other's faces by loud abuse, but by jests spoken <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Based on {{consumer}} affairs programming, a studio audience of the day's guests with children sitting by them {{were given the}} chance to ask questions to Captain Justice (Ant in a Superman-esque costume), but Dec would rephrase the question before the children had a chance to speak. The Captain would, in a booming echoing voice, give an explanation of how he'd do a superhero-esque revenge in answer to the problems, such as dealing with a store by unleashing the Horsemen of the Apocalypse to lay waste to it and leaving horse manure everywhere. Then, presenter Dec would say [...] "or..." [...] and, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>voice,</b> Captain Justice would give a more realistic answer, such as simply asking for their money back.|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't that I don't {{like the}} man," [...] he said, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rather <b>small</b> <b>voice.</b> [...] "But I knew {{if he went}} on I should have to do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{sure you}} are welcome," [...] she said <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> {{monotonous}} <b>voice.</b> [...] "Any of Stephen's friends are welcome, and more especially those of them who are suffering persecution for the Right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{brought it}} to see my way back with," [...] said Maud <b>in</b> <b>a</b> curious, <b>small</b> <b>voice.</b> [...] "It's very dark across the fields. I didn't light it before, because I was afraid {{somebody}} might see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Grandfather Frog," [...] said Danny Meadow Mouse <b>in</b> <b>a</b> very <b>small</b> <b>voice,</b> for {{you know}} he was quite out of breath with running, [...] "Oh, Grandfather Frog, I've brought you four fat, foolish, green flies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are going}} to take me to Blentz and confine me there?" [...] asked the girl <b>in</b> <b>a</b> very <b>small</b> <b>voice</b> and with wide incredulous eyes. [...] "You would not dare thus to humiliate a Von der Tann?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh Nick dear!" [...] Biddy exclaimed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> sweet <b>voice</b> of protest. It was plainly her {{theory that}} Peter would come, {{and even a}} little her fond fear that she might miss him should she quit that spot.|$|R
6000|$|This Pink Bear seemed lifeless {{until the}} King turned a crank which {{protruded}} from its side, {{when the little}} creature turned its head stiffly {{from side to side}} and said <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> shrill <b>voice,</b> [...] "Hurrah for the King of Bear Center!" ...|$|R
6000|$|So they tuned their {{pipes and}} made [...] "music in the air" [...] for an hour, {{to the great}} delight of Sammy, who joined in every song, and was easily persuaded to give sundry {{nautical}} melodies <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shrill <b>small</b> <b>voice</b> which convulsed his hearers with merriment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, dear," [...] {{she replied}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cold, <b>small</b> <b>voice,</b> [...] "so {{you are still}} {{worrying}} about that. I--I envied you." [...] With a glance over her shoulder, she leaned closer. [...] "Next time you go," [...] she breathed out to me, [...] "we'll go together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 46. I {{need not}} say that the harm of the idolatry must depend on the {{certainty}} of the negative. If there be <b>a</b> real presence <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pillar of cloud, <b>in</b> <b>an</b> unconsuming flame, or <b>in</b> <b>a</b> still <b>small</b> <b>voice,</b> it is no sin to bow down before these.|$|R
6000|$|... "You told me," [...] she said, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> very <b>small</b> <b>voice,</b> [...] "that {{my place}} was beside the man I loved," [...] {{and she turned}} her eyes toward Korak all filled with the {{wonderful}} light that no other man had yet seen in them, and that none other ever would.|$|R
6000|$|When {{they arrived}} {{back at the}} house, Hermione stood on the lawn and sang out, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> strange, <b>small,</b> high <b>voice</b> that carried very far: ...|$|R
50|$|In manga, {{there is}} a {{tendency}} to include the speech necessary for the storyline in balloons, while small scribbles outside the balloons add side comments, often used for irony or to show that theyre said <b>in</b> <b>a</b> much <b>smaller</b> <b>voice.</b> Satsuki Yotsuba in the manga series Negima is notable because she speaks almost entirely in side scribble.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not {{skilled in}} reading men," [...] she said <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sad, <b>small</b> <b>voice.</b> [...] "How should I be, that am but a maid {{who has led}} a cloistered life. I was told of you that you were violent and passionate, a man of bitter enmities, easily stirred to hatreds, cruel and {{ruthless}} in the persecution of them." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{turned his}} back upon her for a moment, that she might not see his face. 'Ah--I do remember,' he said at last, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dry, <b>small,</b> {{repressed}} <b>voice.</b>|$|R
