However, in the SRB the decreasing trend is not only related with climate variability and change, also with intensive reforestation aimed at halting desertification and erosion, whichever the reason is, the default assumption of stationarity in water resources systems cannot be guaranteed. Therefore there is an important need for improvement in the ability of monitoring and predicting the impacts associated with the change of hydrologic regimes. It is thus necessary to apply non-stationary probabilistic models, which are able to reproduce probability density functions whose parameters vary with time. From a high-resolution daily gridded rainfall dataset of more than five decades (1950 − 2007), the spatial distribution of lengths of maximum dry spells for several thresholds are assessed, applying Generalized Additive Models for Location Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) models at the grid site.

40|$|AbstractDrought {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{constraints}} affecting food security and livelihoods of more than two billion people that reside on dry areas which constitute 41 % of the world׳s land surface. Drought is defined as deficiency of precipitation over an extended period of time resulting in water scarcity. Our best minds should be concentrated where the greatest challenges lie today – on discoveries and new solutions to cope with the challenges facing dry areas particularly drought and water scarcity. In addition to facing severe natural resource constraints caused by the lack of water in many of the developing world׳s drylands, we also have to cope with rapid growth of the younger segment of the growing population, and high levels of poverty. Coping with drought and water scarcity are critical to address major development challenges in dry areas namely poverty, hunger, environmental degradation and social conflict. Drought is a climatic event that cannot be prevented, but interventions and <b>preparedness</b> to <b>drought</b> can help to: (i) be better prepared to cope with drought; (ii) develop more resilient ecosystems (iii) improve resilience to recover from drought; and (iv) mitigate the impacts of <b>droughts.</b> <b>Preparedness</b> strategies to <b>drought</b> include: (a) geographical shifts of agricultural systems; (b) climate-proofing rainfall-based systems; (c) making irrigated systems more efficient; (d) expanding the intermediate rainfed–irrigated systems. The paper presents successful research results and case studies applying some innovative techniques where clear impact is demonstrated to cope with drought and contribute to food security in dry areas. The CGIAR Consortium Research Program (CRP) on “Integrated and Sustainable Agricultural Production Systems for Improved Food Security and Livelihoods in Dry Areas” (in short, “Dryland Systems”), led by ICARDA, was launched in May 2013 with many partners and stakeholders from 40 countries. It addresses farming systems in dry areas, at a global level, involving 80 partner institutions. The Dryland Systems Program aims at coping with drought and water scarcity to enhance food security and reduce poverty in dry areas through an integrated agro-ecosystem approach. It will also deliver science-based solutions that can be adopted in regions that are not yet experiencing extreme shocks, but will be affected in the medium to long-term. The approach entails shifting the thinking away from the traditional focus on a small number of research components to take an integrated approach aiming to address agro-ecosystems challenges. Such an approach involves crops, livestock, rangeland, trees, soils, water and policies. It {{is one of the}} first global research for development efforts that brings “systems thinking” to farming innovations leading to improved livelihoods in the developing world. The new technique uses modern innovation platforms to involve all stakeholders, adopting the value chain concept along a research-to-impact pathway for enhanced food security and improved livelihoods in dry areas...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 The {{impact of}} recent severe {{droughts}} throughout the United States, {{the potential for}} climate change to intensify the frequency and severity of drought, and discussion {{about the future of}} government assistance in agriculture highlight the need for a transition from drought as ‘disaster’ to drought as ‘managed risk’. However, guidance for agricultural producers about optimal <b>drought</b> <b>preparedness</b> and response is insufficient. It is particularly unclear what optimal <b>drought</b> <b>preparedness</b> and response should look like, in practice, for farm systems with uncertain water supplies and intra- and inter-year dynamics. A mathematical programming model that captures the stochastic and dynamic aspects of an irrigated row crop farm is developed and used to explore the nature of optimal <b>drought</b> <b>preparedness</b> and response. Results indicate several important characteristics. First, drought has the potential to generate heterogeneous impacts, even across a set of homogeneous farms. Second, a farm system with inter-year dynamics can continue to experience the effects of drought after the drought itself subsides; additionally, the effects of drought in one year can intensify the impact of drought in subsequent years. Third, in the presence of discount and interest rates, crop diversification does not maximize expected profit, even though it is often considered a drought management tool. Fourth, the primary effect of water supply uncertainty is the abandonment of more fall-prepared fields. Hence, the multi-peril crop insurance program’s prevented planting provision is identified as an optimal <b>drought</b> <b>preparedness</b> tool, even if unsubsidized. Finally, the predicted effects of climate change for snowmelt-dependent farm systems require distinctly different forms of adaptation, and cause profit losses of different magnitudes. Because the model captures both intra- and inter-year dynamics, it provides 1) a more thorough understanding of the complex tradeoffs that producers face when preparing for and responding to drought, 2) a more complete picture of the dynamic impacts of drought, and 3) important insights about the administration of drought assistance programs. Lastly, it elucidates the meaning of optimal drought preparedness; a notion that has received increased attention in the policy arena, but whose practical form has been only vaguely alluded to...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Drought is a slow-onset natural {{disaster}} that has widespread consequences. Planning at macro and meso levels often assumes that farmers react to and manage drought in similar ways. If this assumption of homogeneity is incorrect, the potential effectiveness of drought mitigation efforts {{is likely to}} be dangerously inhibited. This research investigated the validity of the homogeneity assumption among Iranian farmers. More specifically, it examined whether farmers use different strategies to mitigate drought and, if so, whether a typology to classify their management approaches can be developed. A multistage, stratified random sample (n= 258) of farmers in Fars province who suffered drought was surveyed. The research identified that different strategies were used and that a drought management typology comprising three types of drought management could be constructed: (i) technical (TDM) (ii) psycho-economic (PDM) and (iii) integrated (IDM). These three drought management approaches were discussed and recommendations made to improving <b>drought</b> mitigation and <b>preparedness.</b> Key words: <b>Drought</b> management Typology Impact Farmers Iran INTRODUCTION scientific and policy communities explains, to some Drought is a normal, recurrent climate feature [1] most parts of the world.

40|$|Drought is a normal, {{recurrent}} {{feature of}} climate that affects virtually all countries to some degree. The number of drought-induced natural disasters has grown significantly since the 1960 s, {{largely as a}} result of increasing vulnerability to extended periods of precipitation deficiency rather than be-cause of an increase in the frequency of meteorological droughts. This increase in drought-induced natural disasters has resulted in a considerable growth of interest in drought mitigation and prepar-edness worldwide. The purpose of a national preparedness plan is to reduce societal vulnerability to drought through the adoption of preventive, anticipatory policies and programs. This paper de-scribes a ten-step planning process that nations can follow to develop a <b>drought</b> <b>preparedness</b> plan. This process, originally developed in 1987, has been the basis of discussions at training seminars on <b>drought</b> <b>preparedness</b> for developing nations in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

40|$|Because {{droughts}} are {{a normal}} part of climate variability for virtually all regions, it is important to develop <b>drought</b> <b>preparedness</b> plans to deal with these events in a timely, sys-tematic manner. But past attempts to manage drought and its impacts through a reactive, crisis manage-ment approach have been ineffective, poorly coordinated, and untimely, as illustrated by the hydro-illogi-cal cycle (below). For a number of reasons, governments may find it difficult to move from a reactive approach to one that is more pro-active. Drought's slow onset and the lack of a universal definition of drought cause problems for scien-tists, natural resource managers, and policy makers. Because drought is not as visual as other natural hazards, it may be difficult for the public to understand its impacts and the need to plan for drought. Yet another other constraint to <b>drought</b> <b>preparedness</b> is lack of methodologies to guide people through the planning process. In response, Wilhite (Wilhite, 1991; Wilhite et al., 2000) developed and revised a methodology that provides guidelines, a checklist of the key elements of a drought plan, and a process-the 10 -step drought plan-ning process-through which these elements can be adapted to any level of government or geographical set-ting...|$|E

For ex-ample, the economic impacts of the 1976 – 77 and 1988 droughts have been estimated at nearly $ 35 billion and $ 40 billion, respectively (NOAA, 1982; Riebsame et al., 1990). Other drought years, such as 1980, 1983, 1986, and 1989 – 91, resulted in significant losses as well. The present and future impacts of the current (1992) drought in the western states and in portions of the east {{are likely to be}} substantial and long-lasting.

40|$|Drought is a complex, slow-onset {{phenomenon}} that affects {{more people than}} any other natural haz-ard and results in serious economic, social, and environmental impacts. Although drought affects virtually all climatic regimes and has significant consequences in both developed and developing countries, its impacts are especially serious in developing countries where dryland agriculture pre-dominates. The impacts of drought are often an indicator of unsustainable land and water manage-ment practices, and drought assistance or relief provided by governments and donors encourages land managers and others to continue these practices. This often results in a greater dependence on government {{and a decline in}} self-reliance. Moving from crisis to risk management will require the adoption of a new paradigm for land managers, governments, international and regional develop-ment organizations, and nongovernmental organizations. This approach emphasizes preparedness, mitigation, and improved early warning systems (EWS) over emergency response and assistance measures. Article 10 of the Convention to Combat Desertification states that national action pro-grams should be established to identify the factors contributing to desertification and practical measures necessary to combat desertification and mitigate the effects of drought. In the past 10 years, there has been considerable recognition by governments of the need to develop drought prepared-ness plans and policies to reduce the impacts of drought. Unfortunately, progress in drought pre-paredness during the last decade has been slow because most nations lack the institutional capacity and human and financial resources necessary to develop comprehensive drought plans and policies. Recent commitments by governments and international organizations and new drought monitoring technologies and planning and mitigation methodologies are cause for optimism. The challenge is the implementation of these new technologies and methodologies. It is critical for governments that possess this experience to share it with others through regional and global networks.

40|$|ABSTRACT] Drought is {{a natural}} hazard that has {{significant}} impact on environmental, economic and socio economic aspects. The Indonesian Agroclimate and Hydrology Research Institute (IAHRI) is currently developing a vegetation drought monitoring system by using either the meteorological or satellite imagery {{as part of its}} effort to combat the effects of drought in Indonesia. The project methodology is depended on six main steps: (1) Development of meteorological database system, (2) Analysis of vegetation drought using Water and Agroclimate Research Management model (WARM ver. 1. 0), (3) Determination the drought index based on meteorological data, (4) Building the ground station High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) AVHRR receiver, (5) Application the remote sensing for vegetation drought monitoring, and (6) On-line spatial drought information delivery. The primary goal of this project is to develop an efficient system in Indonesia to analyze and deliver drought related information to the stakeholders and agricultural industries on the ground for <b>drought</b> <b>preparedness</b> and management...|$|E
40|$|Although drought is a normal, {{recurring}} {{feature of}} climate, little {{progress has been}} made in drought management in most parts of the world. A United Nations study of selected Sub-Saharan African countries revealed that most states have little experience in proactive planning for drought. Only Botswana and South Africa have made serious efforts to develop <b>drought</b> <b>preparedness</b> and response. The lack of contingency planning for drought events in the region results from limited financial resources, inadequate understanding of drought impacts, and poor coordination among government agencies. A ten-step planning process, originally developed in 1991 for U. S. states, is suggested as an organizational tool for Sub-Saharan countries to use in the development of drought plans. The process, which emphasizes risk management rather than crisis management, is based on three primary components: (1) monitoring and early warning, (2) vulnerability and impact assessment, and (3) mitigation and response. The steps in the process are generic; they can be adapted and applied to the various settings of Sub-Saharan Africa...|$|E

40|$|Drought is a {{recurring}} reality {{in many parts}} of the Sub-Saharan Africa, where agriculture continues to be a major sector of most economies, and being predominantly rain-fed, is highly prone to drought. Drought thus gives challenges to economic management at all levels, from households, to governments at all levels, other concerned agencies, local NGOs, external donors, and international organizations involved in disaster relief provision. Dealing with drought has long been a key element of policy making in SSA but the poor outcomes of drought experience in many situations mean that there is yet far to go in refining drought management to avoid the suffering from hunger and starvation. Much contemporary effort is being focused novel instruments that may enrich the policy agenda and mainstream <b>drought</b> <b>preparedness</b> in the broader development strategy. It is important to adopt a comprehensive drought risk management strategy, and shift from a crisis management mode to ex-ante strategic interventions. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|E
