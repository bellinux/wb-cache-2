500|$|Assuming {{it was a}} {{legitimate}} checkpoint, McCoy informed the others inside the minibus of a military checkpoint up ahead and pulled in at the lay-by as directed by the armed men. As McCoy rolled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> produced his driving licence, gunmen {{came up to the}} minibus and one of them said in a Northern Irish accent, [...] "Goodnight, fellas. How are things? Can you step out of the van {{for a few minutes and}} we'll just do a check". The unsuspecting band members got out and were politely told to line up facing the ditch at the rear of the minibus with their hands on their heads. More uniformed men appeared from out of the darkness, their guns pointed at the minibus. About 10 gunmen were at the checkpoint, according to author and journalist Martin Dillon.|$|E
500|$|By May 6, the jails were so full that Connor {{transformed}} the stockade {{at the state}} fairgrounds into a makeshift jail to hold protesters. Blacks arrived at white churches to integrate services. They were accepted in Roman Catholic, Episcopal, and Presbyterian churches but turned away at others, where they knelt and prayed until they were arrested. Well-known national figures arrived to show support. Singer Joan Baez arrived to perform for free at Miles College and stayed at the black-owned and integrated Gaston Motel. Comedian Dick Gregory and Barbara Deming, a writer for The Nation, were both arrested. The young Dan Rather reported for CBS News. The car of Fannie Flagg, a local television personality and recent Miss Alabama finalist, was surrounded by teenagers who recognized her. Flagg worked at Channel 6 on the morning show, and after asking her producers why the show was not covering the demonstrations, she received orders never to mention them on air. She rolled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> shouted to the children, [...] "I'm with you all the way!" ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 17, 2007, Method Man was {{captured}} in New York City for marijuana allegations. His SUV was pulled over near the Battery Tunnel toll booths for having an expired inspection sticker. An unidentified source said, [...] "It was {{like something out of}} Cheech & Chong. He rolls <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> the smoke would choke a horse." [...] The arresting officer noticed two blunts and a plastic bag containing marijuana in plain view. Upon further inspection more marijuana was found under the driver's seat. Method Man was charged with unlawful possession of marijuana, criminal possession of marijuana, DWI, and driving an uninspected motor vehicle. He reached a plea agreement to perform community service including rapping to young kids about the dangers of drugs.|$|E
60|$|Old Mrs. Martin sat <b>down</b> by <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> Lady Constantine {{bent over}} Swithin.|$|R
2500|$|In On a Wing and a Prayer Campese recalls that, [...] "I {{left that}} room feeling hurt and humiliated. I did {{something}} I virtually never do, as I said much earlier: I {{went out and}} got drunk. Outside in the Dunedin night the rain was trickling <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wind was blowing. It was cold and horrible, which exactly reflected my mood. The drops of rain on <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> could have been tears in my soul." ...|$|R
6000|$|Seni (who {{has come}} <b>down</b> from <b>the</b> <b>window).</b> <b>And</b> {{in a corner}} house, [...] your Highness--think of that! [...] That makes each {{influence}} of double strength.|$|R
60|$|At this {{juncture}} a waiter came forward, and closed <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> {{the balance of}} the conversation was lost to the two Rover boys.|$|E
6000|$|Knight let <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> looked ahead. 'There are a {{great many}} people at the station,' he said. 'They seem all to be on the {{look-out}} for us.' ...|$|E
60|$|A {{few moments}} later {{we came to a}} {{standstill}} in the town station. Feurgéres let <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> talked for a few minutes with the station-master. Then he resumed his seat.|$|E
25|$|In 1954, Prof. Patrick Lynch was {{appointed}} chairman of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta {{at the young}} age of 38, taking {{on the task of}} turning the £60,000 deficit into a profit. He was Chairman for 21 years to 1975, and retired from that position at his own request to the government of the day. In 1956, Aer Lingus introduced a new, green-top livery with a white lighting flash <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Irish flag displayed on the fin.|$|R
6000|$|Marilla sat <b>down</b> by <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at}} Anne. There were {{tears in her}} eyes in {{defiance}} of the oculist's prohibition and her voice broke as she said: ...|$|R
60|$|He un{{fastened}} the rope, {{and the end}} {{was thrown}} <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> Job Tredgold, <b>the</b> other man, fastened it round him and was hauled up as Geoffrey had been.|$|R
60|$|I glanced towards Guest. There {{was a new}} fire in his eyes. I {{saw that}} the idea appealed to him. Nervously he flung <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> let in the fresh air.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] said she, [...] "there is some mistake here. I do {{not know}} by what right you prevent me from pulling <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> giving my {{directions}} to the coachman." ...|$|E
60|$|Unc Nunkie made {{no reply}} for a time. Then he shut <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> turned {{his chair to}} face the room, for the sun was sinking behind the tree-tops and it was growing cool.|$|E
6000|$|Henrietta hesitated, but {{her mother}} took the letter from her, sat <b>down</b> near <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> {{composed}} herself to read without the least regard to her daughter's vehement distress. The letter ran thus: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll sit <b>down</b> by <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> {{watch for}} it," [...] said Mary Margaret to herself. [...] "Then, {{when it is}} lighted, I'll get up a nice warm supper for Mother and Uncle Martin." ...|$|R
50|$|In the church, Dencio {{is trapped}} inside his car when {{he plans to}} save Mac-Mac in the church. The spirit taunts him and he tries to give back the money he stole. He rolls <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> tries to get out but is {{ultimately}} killed after his neck being impaled by a shattered glass of a car window. When Mac-Mac is {{able to get out}} from the church, he sees the spirits of the recently killed victims warning them that Cedric and Leni are both in danger. He then follows Roman's spirit {{on the way to the}} house.|$|R
60|$|The train slackened speed. The {{lights of}} Dover flashed out on either side. They drew {{up at the}} town station and waited there for some minutes. Reist let <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> {{addressed}} a porter.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{there came}} an interruption. The shrill {{whistling}} of the engine, the shutting off of steam, the violent {{application of the}} brake. The train came to a standstill. The man put <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> looked out.|$|E
60|$|This advice quite {{coinciding with}} his own opinion, Mr. Pickwick gently let <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> {{disengaged}} the bottle from the stick; upon which the latter was drawn up, and Mr. Bob Sawyer was heard to laugh heartily.|$|E
5000|$|The {{church in}} the song is used figuratively to {{describe}} the sanctuary that she feels is her car when she plays music on the Highway FM radio while driving.The song refers to listening to country icons like Johnny Cash and Hank Williams and is about [...] "the simple joy that comes with turning up <b>the</b> volume, rolling <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> singing along to the radio at 65 miles an hour." [...] She compares the experience to a church revival, saying, [...] "Yeah, I guess that's my church." [...] She co-wrote and co-produced the single with busbee.|$|R
60|$|He sat <b>down</b> at <b>the</b> open <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> {{looked out}} {{leaning on the}} sill.|$|R
5000|$|... 8.04 am: Gargasoulas is spotted {{driving in}} the {{background}} of a Today [...] "live cross" [...] which is reporting on the Windsor stabbing. <b>The</b> man rolls <b>down</b> <b>the</b> car <b>window</b> <b>and</b> waves his hat at the news camera.|$|R
6000|$|Slip <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> say, 'He {{has gone}} South for the week,' and he'll tumble. It's only cutting your time of stay in those parts by two days. I ask {{you as a}} stranger--going to the West," [...] he said, with emphasis.|$|E
60|$|After a time {{he heard}} the whistle, and {{imagined}} the train {{was going to stop}} at a small station to which mails were brought from some mining camps. The neighboring country was rugged and lonely, but a trail ran south through the woods to the American frontier. When the cars stopped he pushed <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> looked out.|$|E
60|$|I let <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> looked out; Millcote {{was behind}} us; {{judging by the}} number of its lights, it seemed a place of {{considerable}} magnitude, much larger than Lowton. We were now, as far as I could see, on a sort of common; but there were houses scattered all over the district; I felt we were in a different region to Lowood, more populous, less picturesque; more stirring, less romantic.|$|E
60|$|After five minutes, {{during which}} his mind had {{travelled}} into a remote speculation of social {{conditions of the}} future, and lost itself at last over the time dimension, Dr. Kemp roused himself with a sigh, pulled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> again, <b>and</b> returned to his writing desk.|$|R
60|$|The {{judge was}} a bit startled at so novel a {{suggestion}} but assented with a nod. In a twinkling the operator had suspended a roller-screen from the chandelier dependent from <b>the</b> ceiling, pulled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> shades <b>and</b> attached his projecting machine to an electric-light socket.|$|R
5000|$|Novelist Saul Bellow {{recalled}} {{hearing a}} fireside chat while walking in Chicago one summer evening. [...] "The blight hadn't yet carried off the elms, and under them drivers had pulled over, parking bumper to bumper, {{and turned on}} their radios to hear Roosevelt. They had rolled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> opened <b>the</b> car doors. Everywhere the same voice, its odd Eastern accent, which in anyone else would have irritated Midwesterners. You could follow without missing a single word as you strolled by. You felt joined to these unknown drivers, men and women smoking their cigarettes in silence, not so much considering the President's words as affirming the rightness of his tone and taking assurance from it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was reading," [...] I said, [...] "the other day, {{an account}} of the {{marriage}} customs prevailing among the Lower Caucasians. The lover takes his stand beneath his lady's window, and, having attracted her attention, proceeds to sing. And if she seems to like it--if she listens to it without getting mad, that means she doesn't want him. But if she gets upset about it--slams <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> walks away, then it's all right. I think it's the Lower Caucasians." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{a sudden}} mad fear came upon her, shut {{up in the}} dark with this dreadful voiceless thing. She screamed in her terror, and strove to pull <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> open the door. But a grip of steel closed {{suddenly}} round her wrist and forced her back into her seat. And yet the man's body had not moved, {{and there was no}} sound save the lurching and rasping of the carriage and the clatter of the flying horses. They were already out on the country roads far beyond Versailles. It was darker than before, heavy clouds had banked over the heavens, and the rumbling of thunder was heard low down on the horizon.|$|E
6000|$|I {{remember}} very freshly {{the mood}} of our departure from London, the platform of Charing Cross with the big illuminated clock overhead, the bustle of porters and passengers with luggage, the shouting of newsboys and boys with flowers and sweets, and the groups of friends seeing travellers off by the boat train. Isabel sat very quiet and still in the compartment, and I stood upon the platform with the door open, with a curious reluctance to take the last step that should sever me from London's ground. I showed our tickets, and bought a handful of red roses for her. At last came the guards crying: [...] "Take your seats," [...] and I got in {{and closed the door}} on me. We had, thank Heaven! a compartment to ourselves. I let <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> stared out.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> heads dropped <b>down</b> from <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> {{an uncanny}} silence {{fell on the}} beleaguered carriage. Abbleway neither moved nor spoke. Perhaps the brutes had not clearly seen or winded the human {{occupants}} of the carriage, and had prowled away on some other errand of rapine.|$|R
60|$|A {{vigilant}} watch {{was kept}} up, {{but nothing was}} seen of Mike, till late in the afternoon, when he emerged {{into one of the}} open spaces. They had now taken <b>the</b> handkerchief <b>down</b> from <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and,</b> directly they saw him, Desmond waved it, showing that they were watching him. He threw up his arm, turned, and disappeared again.|$|R
60|$|The horrified {{prisoner}} {{heard them}} pass downstairs again, and, after {{a glass of}} water, sat <b>down</b> by <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> tried to think. He got up and tried the door, but it opened inwards, and after a severe onslaught the handle came off in his hand. Tired out at last {{he went to bed}} again, and slept fitfully until morning.|$|R
