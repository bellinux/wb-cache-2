25|$|Pit latrines {{are often}} {{relocated}} or re-built after some years (when the pit is full {{and if the}} pit is not emptied) and thus need more space than urine-diverting dry toilets for example and people are less willing {{to invest in a}} nice high-quality super-structure as <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dismantled at some point.|$|E
25|$|UDDTs with vaults {{are also}} more {{permanent}} structures than most pit latrines, the latter of which in rural areas are typically relocated when the pit is full rather than emptying the pit.

500|$|A special runway will be {{required}} for launch: {{it needs to be}} reinforced to tolerate the high equivalent single wheel load; necessitated by the Skylon's 325 tonnes takeoff weight; it will need to have heat resistant sections {{at the start of the}} take-off run and at the rotation zone; and <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> [...] long to allow the Skylon to accelerate to its [...] rotation speed, yet still have [...] to abort the launch and brake to a standstill if required.

500|$|Back home, Kennedy {{played with}} the Port Colborne Sailors of the OHA Sr. league for the 1942–43 hockey season. The Port Colborne coach was former NHL star and Hall of Fame inductee Nels Stewart who had been hired in November. Stewart became a mentor to Kennedy, working on his playmaking skills. Kennedy credits Stewart with {{teaching}} him how to [...] "operate {{in front of the}} net". Kennedy finished the season second in the league, only one point behind scoring champion, Dillon Brady of Hamilton. It was during this time that Kennedy debuted as a player at Maple Leaf Gardens. OHA senior teams played at the Gardens on Friday evenings and this included Kennedy and the Port Colborne Sailors. At the end of the season, in early February 1943, in spite of his having abandoned the Royals, Montreal scout Gus Ogilvie was sent to induce Kennedy to sign a contract with the promise that if he signed, he would finish the season with the Canadiens in the NHL. Concerned about his treatment in Montreal, he declined, despite being warned by Ogilvie, [...] "Well, you know, Ted, if you turn pro, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> with the Canadiens." [...] Kennedy now thought his dreams of playing in the NHL were over. However, Nels Stewart believed in Kennedy, considering him [...] "a coming great", and recommended him to the Toronto Maple Leafs. Shortly thereafter, Kennedy was called out of his grade 11 Latin class to the Principal's office. Kennedy, the high school student, was at first worried about what he may have done wrong, {{but it turned out to}} be a phone call from Nels Stewart. Stewart had arranged a meeting with General Manager of the Leafs Frank Selke and Kennedy had to travel immediately to Toronto. Unlike Montreal, the Maple Leafs had someone there to meet Kennedy when he got off the train. Kennedy signed a contract that evening.|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} (and widespread use) {{of credit}} cards increases trading efficiency but, by also increasing the velocity of money, it causes massive inflation, {{in the absence of}} monetary intervention. If the monetary authority attempts to restore pre-credit card price levels by reducing the money supply, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> sacrifice all the efficiency gains. When there is default on credit cards, there is even more inflation, and less efficiency gain. The monetary authority <b>will</b> then <b>have</b> <b>to</b> accept less than pre-credit card efficiency in order to restore pre-credit card price levels, or else <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> accept substantial inflation if it is unwilling to cut efficiency below pre-credit card levels.

Pashkin tells them that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{at least four times}} bigger in order to make room for pregnant women, though, and he convinces management to give the order. Voschev, who followed the peasant claiming ownership of the empty coffins, returns to the worksite to announce that Kozlov and Safronov are dead. The workers steal Nastya's empty coffins and bury the men in them. She doesn’t understand why someone who is not alive is given preference.

2500|$|The Belgrade Fortress was {{nominated}} by the Serbian {{government for the}} UNESCO's World Heritage Site. Architects and urbanists think that possible inclusion on the list will protect the fortress from [...] "aggressive transitional construction". In that case, {{the outlines of the}} fortress and a panoramic view on <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> preserved. The perceived visual pollution encompasses several objects. A gigantic object, a late 2000s project by the Zaha Hadid's studio, on the northern side of the fortress, down the slope of Danube. The project, despite some preparatory works, still didn't start off. The other was the spiral project [...] "Cloud" [...] by Sou Fujimoto, which was to connect the Sava port to the fortress, but the project was scrapped after 2013 when the mayoral tenure of Đilas ended. Third is the highly controversial Belgrade Waterfront project.|$|E
2500|$|The form of {{the wording}} to be used on the tablets {{was the subject of}} {{correspondence}} between Commission officials and advisors. One such letter, between Kipling and Ware was written on 8 May 1923, with Kipling giving his thoughts on the wording proposed for the Notre Dame tablet (unveiled the following year) in light of the wording being used for the Amiens tablet (unveiled two months after this letter was written): Of course, [...] "diocese", in this connection, is absurd. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> [...] "France". Otherwise I don't see much wrong with the wording, except that, it seems to me, [...] "dead", in place of [...] "men", is the clou. The difficulty is the supplementary clause, and the word [...] "especially", which, I fear, can't be avoided. I prefer [...] "honoured" [...] or [...] "enduring" [...] to [...] "sacred", but there may be good reason for keeping to the last. I think that the word [...] "here" [...] after [...] "rest", gives a touch of intimacy between the two lands. Kipling went on to suggest a draft {{form of the}} inscription that was eventually used (with further changes) on the Notre Dame tablet.|$|E
2500|$|In just {{a three-year}} career, Lightfoot scored 2,201points, which through the 2010–11 season remain {{the most in}} Big Sky history. In each year, he {{averaged}} 20+ points per game for a career average of 23.1 – nearly four points per game better than the next closest player at Idaho. He was a three-time first team all-conference selection, two-time conference player of the year, and currently holds 13 different records in the Vandals' record book. Among them are the top three single season scoring averages and four of the top six single game scoring marks. His career scoring record is also more than 500points greater than the second closest player in school history.
