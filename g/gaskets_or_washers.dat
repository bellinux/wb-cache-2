50|$|Leaks {{are often}} {{repaired}} by plugging the leaking holes or using a patch to cover them. Leaking tires are often fixed this way. Leaking <b>gaskets,</b> seals, <b>washers,</b> <b>or</b> packing can be replaced. Use of welding, soldering, sealing, or gluing {{may be other}} ways to fix leaks. Sometimes, the most practical solution is to replace the leaking unit. Leaking water heaters are often replaced by home or building owners.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of surface {{roughness}} appearing on a turned sealing surface on compressive stress and compressive force of copper gaskets (a fiat gasket, a ring joint gasket and a copper wire gasket) was studied. The results obtained can be summarized as follows : (I) In {{the case of a}} flat <b>gasket</b> <b>or</b> a ring joint gasket, in order to ignore both the surface roughness appearing on a turned sealing surface and the cross section of gasket, the compressive stress for sealing had to be nearly equal to 1. 3 times the tensile strength of the copper gasket. (2) In the case of a ring joint <b>gasket</b> <b>or</b> a copper wire gasket, the values of maximum heigh roughness, in which the minimum compressive force for sealing applied, were found in the region between 2 μm and 20 μm or not less than 110 μm respectively...|$|R

5000|$|Each {{male end}} of a typical garden hose can mate with the female {{connector}} on another, which allows multiple garden hoses to be linked end-to-end to increase their overall length. Small rubber <b>or</b> plastic <b>washers</b> (often confusingly called [...] "hose washers") are used in female ends to prevent leakage, because the threads are not tapered and {{are not used to}} create a seal. Sometimes the <b>gaskets</b> stiffen, disintegrate, <b>or</b> fall out of older hoses, which results in pressurized leakage spraying from the hose; simply replacing the washer insert often fixes the problem.|$|R

25|$|Crevice {{corrosion}} is a localized form of corrosion {{occurring in}} confined spaces (crevices), {{to which the}} access of the working fluid from the environment is limited. Formation of a differential aeration cell leads to corrosion inside the crevices. Examples of crevices are gaps and contact areas between parts, under <b>gaskets</b> <b>or</b> seals, inside cracks and seams, spaces filled with deposits and under sludge piles.|$|R
5000|$|Raising the {{compression}} ratio {{by reducing the}} size of the combustion chamber, which makes more efficient use of the cylinder pressure developed and leading to more rapid burning of fuel, by using larger compression height pistons <b>or</b> thinner head <b>gaskets,</b> <b>or</b> by using a milling machine or [...] "shaving" [...] the cylinder head. High compression ratios can cause engine knock unless high octane fuels are used.|$|R
5000|$|This {{combined}} with the early practice of installing the head gasket with plastic locating dowels, which subsequently melted when the engines overheated, allowed the head gaskets to [...] "walk." [...] A redesigned head gasket, which consists of a multiple layer metal <b>gasket</b> <b>or</b> [...] "MLS" [...] {{used in conjunction with}} steel locating dowels, is alleged to significantly reduce the chance of a head gasket failure.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] {{washing machine}} (laundry machine, clothes <b>washer,</b> <b>or</b> <b>washer)</b> is a machine used to wash laundry, such as {{clothing}} and sheets. The term is mostly applied to machines that use water {{as opposed to}} dry cleaning (which uses alternative cleaning fluids, and is performed by specialist businesses) or ultrasonic cleaners. Laundry detergent is frequently used to clean clothes, and is sold in either powdered or liquid form.|$|R
50|$|The {{prepared}} piano, {{present in}} some contemporary art {{music from the}} 20th and 21st century is a piano with objects placed inside it to alter its sound, or has had its mechanism changed in some other way. The scores for music for prepared piano specify the modifications, for example instructing the pianist to insert pieces of rubber, paper, metal screws, <b>or</b> <b>washers</b> in between the strings. These either mute the strings or alter their timbre. A harpsichord-like sound can be produced by placing or dangling small metal buttons {{in front of the}} hammer. Adding an eraser between the bass strings produces a mellow, thumpy sound reminiscent of the plucked double bass. Inserting metal screws <b>or</b> <b>washers</b> can cause the piano to make a jangly sound as these metal items vibrate against the strings. In 1954 a German company exhibited a wire-less piano at the Spring Fair in Frankfurt, Germany that sold for US$238. The wires were replaced by metal bars of different alloys that replicated the standard wires when played. A similar concept is used in the electric-acoustic Rhodes piano.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an introduction to}} the Apollonian fractal, also known by some as the curvilinear Sierpinski gasket. This fractal is not particularly well known, perhaps because it is not as straightforward to construct as many other fractals such as the related Sierpinski <b>gasket</b> <b>or</b> the Menger sponge. The brief history and a general description of the fractal will be given, including the geometric construction in two dimensions and an iterated function system (IFS) formulation...|$|R
5000|$|Retort-type {{furnaces}} {{differ from}} other batch-type furnaces {{in that they}} make use of a sealed lining called a [...] "retort". The retort is generally sealed with either a <b>gasket</b> <b>or</b> is welded shut and filled completely with the desired atmosphere and then heated externally by conventional heating elements. Due to the high temperatures involved, the retort is usually made of heat resistant alloys that resist oxidation. Retort furnaces are often either used in a batch or semi-continuous versions.|$|R
25|$|Typically these {{rectifiers}} {{were made}} up of stacks of metal plates <b>or</b> <b>washers,</b> held together by a central bolt, {{with the number of}} stacks determined by voltage; each cell was rated for about 20 V. An automotive battery charger rectifier might have only one cell: the high-voltage power supply for a vacuum tube might have dozens of stacked plates. Current density in an air-cooled selenium stack was about 600 mA per square inch of active area (about 90 mA per square centimeter).|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the keys}} to the Offenhauser engine's success and {{popularity}} was its power. A 251.92 cubic inch (4,128.29 cm³) DOHC four-cylinder racing Offy with a 15:1 compression ratio and a 4.28125 × 4.375 in bore and stroke, could produce [...] at 6,600 rpm (1.77 hp per cubic inch (81 kW/L). Other variants of the engine produced even higher outputs of 3 hp per cubic inch (137 kW/L). Another reason for the engine's success was its reliability; its monobloc construction meant it was not vulnerable to head <b>gasket</b> <b>or</b> cylinder stud problems, and allowed for higher cylinder pressures.|$|R
