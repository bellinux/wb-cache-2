He led the <b>Ivory</b> Coast to the 2006 FIFA World Cup, their first appearance in the tournament, and also scored their first goal. He later captained the <b>Ivory</b> Coast at the 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cups. He {{was part of the}} <b>Ivory</b> Coast teams that reached the final of the Africa Cup of Nations in 2006 and 2012, but were beaten on penalties on both occasions.

Following the Iraq War 2003 the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad was looted, {{and many of the}} <b>ivories</b> kept there were damaged or stolen. Other <b>ivories</b> that were stored in a bank vault in Baghdad were damaged by water when the building was shelled.|$|R

Chyna challenged <b>Ivory</b> for the Women's Championship at the Royal Rumble on January 21, 2001. <b>Ivory</b> retained her title when she pinned Chyna, who had appeared to re-aggravate her neck injury. Chyna challenged <b>Ivory</b> {{for the title}} once more at WrestleMania X-Seven on April 1 and defeated <b>Ivory</b> in a brief match, ending Ivory's third reign as Women's Champion. The Right to Censor stable was finally disbanded on April 26, 2001.|$|E
5|$|United States: In November 2013, the United States {{employed}} {{an industrial}} rock crusher to pulverize six tons of amassed <b>ivory.</b> Although the US does not ban the domestic sale of <b>ivory,</b> {{it is illegal}} to bring <b>ivory</b> into the country. Its interest in destroying its <b>ivory</b> was also connected to research that found links between the <b>ivory</b> trade and threats to national security through terrorism and organized crime. The US government and American non-governmental organizations have been involved in multiple forms of anti-poaching measures, largely in Africa, and American diplomats are actively engaging other governments to take part in eroding the <b>ivory</b> market by destroying stockpiles. Another <b>ivory</b> crush took place in New York City's Times Square in June 2015.|$|E

To be able to process the <b>ivory,</b> the large tusks had to be chopped, chiselled and split into smaller, more manageable pieces.

5|$|Destroying <b>ivory</b> by any {{practical}} {{means is}} difficult. Burning {{is the most}} common method of large-scale destruction of <b>ivory.</b> When Kenya burned 12 tons of it in 1989, it created a major media spectacle and inspired similar actions around the world.

50|$|The {{first group}} of <b>ivories</b> was {{excavated}} {{from the site of}} the palace of Shalmaneser III (ruled 859-824 BC) at the Assyrian capital of Nimrud. The palace was rediscovered in 1845 by Austin Henry Layard, on the very first day of his excavations; on the second day, he made the first discovery of <b>ivories.</b>|$|R
40|$|The first <b>ivories</b> at the Assyrian {{imperial}} {{capital of}} Kalhu/Nimrud in northern Iraq were found by Henry Layard in the mid- 19 th century. Max Mallowan and David Oates (both professors at the Institute of Archaeology), {{together with the}} British School of Archaeology in Iraq, worked there from 1949 – 1963 and found literally thousands more, both in the palaces of the acropolis and in a large outlying building known as Fort Shalmaneser. During the last 50 years the majority has {{been published in the}} <b>Ivories</b> from Nimrud series, so that it is now possible to look at this remarkable corpus as a whole. It immediately becomes evident that most were not made in Assyria, but imported from the states conquered by the Assyrian kings in the early 1 st millennium BC. Many show a debt to the art of Egypt and can be assigned to the ‘Phoenician tradition’, thus recording the otherwise little-known art of the Phoenicians, long famed as master craftsmen. ‘Syrian-Intermediate’ <b>ivories</b> are versions of Phoenician <b>ivories</b> and may represent the art of the recently-arrived Aramaean kingdoms, while the very different ‘North Syrian’ <b>ivories</b> derive from earlier Hittite traditions...|$|R

5|$|Instead of {{destroying}} confiscated <b>ivory,</b> a government {{could choose to}} sell it, and put the funds to use in one of several ways. Several of the countries involved in the <b>ivory</b> trade, especially those {{on the supply side}} in Africa, are also some of the nations which struggle the most with poverty. Destroying <b>ivory</b> in those countries is thus often a controversial decision for internal stakeholders as well as external commentators, as the funds gained by selling the material could be used {{to improve the quality of}} life for human citizens.|$|E
