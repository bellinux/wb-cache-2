5|$|The starch {{source in}} a beer {{provides}} the <b>fermentable</b> material {{and is a}} key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer. The most common starch source used in beer is malted grain. Grain is malted by soaking it in water, allowing it to begin germination, and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln. Malting grain produces enzymes that convert starches in the grain into <b>fermentable</b> sugars. Different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain. Darker malts will produce darker beers.|$|E
5|$|The Andes in South America has Chicha, {{made from}} germinated maize (corn); while the {{indigenous}} peoples in Brazil have Cauim, a traditional beverage made since pre-Columbian times by chewing manioc so that an enzyme (amylase) present in human saliva can break down the starch into <b>fermentable</b> sugars; {{this is similar to}} Masato in Peru.|$|E
5|$|Tooth decay {{is caused}} by certain types of acid-producing {{bacteria}} which cause the most damage {{in the presence of}} <b>fermentable</b> carbohydrates such as sucrose, fructose, and glucose. The resulting acidic levels in the mouth affect teeth because a tooth's special mineral content causes it to be sensitive to low pH. Depending on the extent of tooth destruction, various treatments can be used to restore teeth to proper form, function, and aesthetics, but there is no known method to regenerate large amounts of tooth structure. Instead, dental health organizations advocate preventative and prophylactic measures, such as regular oral hygiene and dietary modifications, to avoid dental caries.|$|E
25|$|One {{method of}} {{reducing}} the volume of flatus produced is dietary modification, {{reducing the amount of}} <b>fermentable</b> carbohydrates. This is the theory behind diets such as the low FODMAP diet (low <b>fermentable</b> oligosaccharide, dissacharide, monosaccharide and polyols).|$|E
25|$|Consistent {{intake of}} <b>fermentable</b> fiber through foods like berries and other fresh fruit, vegetables, whole grains, seeds, and nuts {{is now known}} to reduce risk {{of some of the}} world’s most {{prevalent}} diseases—obesity, diabetes, high blood cholesterol, cardiovascular disease, and numerous gastrointestinal disorders. In this last category are constipation, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, hemorrhoids, Crohn's disease, diverticulitis, and colon cancer—all disorders of the intestinal tract where <b>fermentable</b> fiber can provide healthful benefits.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fermentable</b> fibers e.g., pectin will {{by virtue}} of their {{providing}} a medium for bacterial growth increase the bacterial mass in the colon. The sequestrated bile acids are then excreted in feces.|$|E
25|$|Foods rich in fructans {{and other}} <b>fermentable</b> oligo-, di- and mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAPs), {{including}} artichokes, asparagus, leeks, onions, and wheat-containing products, including breads, cakes, biscuits, breakfast cereals, pies, pastas, pizzas, and wheat noodles.|$|E
25|$|Fructose and fructans are FODMAPs (<b>fermentable</b> oligo-, di- and mono-saccharides and polyols) {{known to}} cause {{gastrointestinal}} discomfort in susceptible individuals. A low FODMAP diet has widespread application for managing functional gastrointestinal disorders such as IBS.|$|E
25|$|The {{germination}} is halted (by heating) {{after three}} to five days, when the optimum amount of starch has been converted to <b>fermentable</b> sugars. The method for drying the germinated barley is by heating it with hot air.|$|E
25|$|Other {{examples}} of <b>fermentable</b> fiber sources (from plant foods or biotechnology) used in functional foods and supplements include resistant starch, inulin, fructans, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), and oligo- or polysaccharides, and resistant dextrins, {{which may be}} partially or fully fermented.|$|E
25|$|The high {{mineral content}} of enamel, which makes this tissue the hardest {{in the human}} body, also makes it {{susceptible}} to a demineralization process which often occurs as dental caries, otherwise known as cavities. Demineralization occurs for several reasons, {{but the most important}} cause of tooth decay is the ingestion of <b>fermentable</b> carbohydrates.|$|E
25|$|Sugars {{for ethanol}} {{fermentation}} {{can be obtained}} from cellulose. Deployment of this technology could turn a number of cellulose-containing agricultural by-products, such as corncobs, straw, and sawdust, into renewable energy resources. Other agricultural residues such as sugar cane bagasse and energy crops such as switchgrass may also be a sources of <b>fermentable</b> sugars.|$|E
25|$|In Lithuania kvass {{is known}} as gira and is widely {{available}} in bottles and draft. Many restaurants in Vilnius make their own gira, which they sell on the premises. Strictly speaking, gira {{can be made from}} anything <b>fermentable</b> — such as caraway tea, beetroot juice, or berries — but it is made mainly from black bread or barley/rye malt.|$|E
25|$|Other sugars are not <b>fermentable</b> at all. After {{consumption}} by the yeast, {{the ratio of}} non-fermentable sugars (the ones that are not consumed by yeast: arabinose and xylose) is between 0.5 and 1.7 grams per litre. Sugars exercise a control over the taste – they balance the spiciness of the acidity and the burning of the alcohol.|$|E
25|$|The {{dental plaque}} biofilm {{can result in}} the disease dental caries if it is allowed to develop over time. An ecologic shift away from {{balanced}} populations within the dental biofilm is driven by certain (cariogenic) microbiological populations beginning to dominate when the environment favours them. The shift to an acidogenic, aciduric, and cariogenic microbiological population develops and is maintained by frequent consumption of <b>fermentable</b> dietary carbohydrate. The resulting activity shift in the biofilm (and resulting acid production within the biofilm, at the tooth surface) is associated with an imbalance between demineralization and remineralisation leading to net mineral loss within dental hard tissues (enamel and then dentin), the sign and symptom being a carious lesion. By preventing the dental plaque biofilm from maturing or by returning it back to a non-cariogenic state, dental caries can be prevented and arrested. This can be achieved though the behavioural step of reducing the supply of <b>fermentable</b> carbohydrates (i.e. sugar intake) and frequent removal of the biofilm (i.e. toothbrushing).|$|E
25|$|Fiber {{does not}} bind to {{minerals}} and vitamins and therefore does not restrict their absorption, but rather evidence exists that <b>fermentable</b> fiber sources improve absorption of minerals, especially calcium. Some plant foods {{can reduce the}} absorption of minerals and vitamins like calcium, zinc, vitamin C, and magnesium, but this {{is caused by the}} presence of phytate (which is also thought to have important health benefits), not by fiber.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fermentable</b> fibers are {{consumed}} by the microbiota within the large intestines, mildly increasing fecal bulk and producing short-chain fatty acids as byproducts with wide-ranging physiological activities (discussion below). Resistant starch, inulin, fructooligosaccharide and galactooligosaccharide are dietary fibers which are fully fermented. These include insoluble as well as soluble fibers. This fermentation impacts the expression of many genes within the large intestine, which impact digestive function and lipid and glucose metabolism, {{as well as the}} immune system, inflammation and more.|$|E
25|$|Inulin is {{advantageous}} {{because it}} contains 25–30% the food energy of sugar or other carbohydrates and 10–15% the food energy of fat. As a prebiotic <b>fermentable</b> fiber, its metabolism by gut flora yields short-chain fatty acids (see below) which increase absorption of calcium, magnesium, and iron, resulting from upregulation of mineral-transporting genes and their membrane transport proteins within the colon wall. Among other potential beneficial effects noted above, inulin promotes {{an increase in the}} mass and health of intestinal Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium populations.|$|E
25|$|Inulin's primary {{disadvantage}} is its tolerance. As a soluble <b>fermentable</b> fiber, it {{is quickly}} and easily fermented within the intestinal tract, which may cause gas and digestive distress at doses higher than 15 grams/day in most people. Individuals with digestive diseases have benefited from removing fructose and inulin from their diet. While clinical studies have shown changes in the microbiota at lower levels of inulin intake, some of the health effects require higher than 15 grams per day to achieve the benefits.|$|E
25|$|Chemically {{defined as}} {{oligosaccharides}} occurring naturally in most plants, inulins have nutritional value as carbohydrates, or more specifically as fructans, a polymer {{of the natural}} plant sugar, fructose. Inulin is typically extracted by manufacturers from enriched plant sources such as chicory roots or Jerusalem artichokes for use in prepared foods. Subtly sweet, {{it can be used}} to replace sugar, fat, and flour, is often used to improve the flow and mixing qualities of powdered nutritional supplements, and has significant potential health value as a prebiotic <b>fermentable</b> fiber.|$|E
25|$|Documented {{evidence}} and recently excavated tombs {{indicate that the}} Chinese brewed alcoholic beverages from both malted grain and grain converted by mold from prehistoric times, but that the malt conversion process was largely considered inefficient {{in comparison with the}} use of molds specially cultivated on rice carrier (the resulting molded rice being called 酒麴 (Jiǔ qū) in Chinese and Koji in Japanese) to convert cooked rice into <b>fermentable</b> sugars, both in the amount of resulting <b>fermentable</b> sugars and the residual by products (the Chinese use the dregs left after fermenting the rice, called 酒糟 (Jiǔzāo), as a cooking ingredient in many dishes, frequently as an ingredient to sauces where Western dishes would use wine), because the rice undergoes starch conversion after being hulled and cooked, rather than whole and in husks like barley malt. Furthermore, the hop plant being unknown in East Asia, malt-based alcoholic beverages did not preserve well over time, and the use of malt in the production of alcoholic beverages gradually fell out of favor in China until disappearing from Chinese history {{by the end of the}} Tang Dynasty. The use of rice became dominant, such that wines from fruits of any type were historically all but unknown except as imports in China.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{cure for}} IBS. Treatment is carried out to improve symptoms. This may include dietary changes, medication, probiotics, and counseling. Dietary {{measures}} include increasing soluble fiber intake, a gluten free diet, or a diet low in <b>fermentable</b> oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP). The medication loperamide {{may be used to}} help with diarrhea while laxatives may be used to help with constipation. Antidepressants may improve overall symptoms and pain. Patient education and a good doctor–patient relationship {{are an important part of}} care.|$|E
25|$|Yeast assimilable {{nitrogen}} or YAN is {{the combination}} of Free Amino Nitrogen (FAN), ammonia (NH3) and ammonium (NH4+) that is available for the wine yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to use during fermentation. Outside of the <b>fermentable</b> sugars glucose and fructose, nitrogen {{is the most important}} nutrient needed to carry out a successful fermentation that doesn't end prior to the intended point of dryness or sees the development of off-odors and related wine faults. To this extent winemakers will often supplement the available YAN resources with nitrogen additives such as diammonium phosphate (DAP).|$|E
25|$|Barley (Hordeum vulgare) {{a member}} of the grass family, is a major cereal grain grown in {{temperate}} climates globally. It {{was one of the first}} cultivated grains, particularly in Eurasia as early as 10,000 years ago. Barley has been used as animal fodder, as a source of <b>fermentable</b> material for beer and certain distilled beverages, and as a component of various health foods. It is used in soups and stews, and in barley bread of various cultures. Barley grains are commonly made into malt in a traditional and ancient method of preparation.|$|E
25|$|Cauim is a {{traditional}} alcoholic beverage of the Native American populations of Brazil since pre-Columbian times. It is still made today in remote areas throughout Panama and South America. Cauim {{is very similar to}} chicha and it is also made by fermenting manioc or maize, sometimes flavored with fruit juices. The Kuna Indians of Panama use plantains. A characteristic feature of the beverage is that the starting material is cooked, chewed, and re-cooked prior to fermentation. As in the making of chicha, enzymes from the saliva of the cauim maker breakdown the starches into <b>fermentable</b> sugars.|$|E
25|$|The {{hydrometer}} transformed how beer was brewed. Before {{its introduction}} beers were brewed {{from a single}} malt: brown beers from brown malt, amber beers from amber malt, pale beers from pale malt. Using the hydrometer, brewers could calculate the yield from different malts. They observed that pale malt, though more expensive, yielded far more <b>fermentable</b> material than cheaper malts. For example, brown malt (used for Porter) gave 54 pounds of extract per quarter, whilst pale malt gave 80 pounds. Once this was known, brewers switched to using mostly pale malt for all beers supplemented with a small quantity of highly coloured malt to achieve the correct colour for darker beers.|$|E
25|$|Chocolate {{has been}} {{prepared}} as a drink {{for nearly all}} of its history. For example, one vessel found at an Olmec archaeological site on the Gulf Coast of Veracruz, Mexico, dates chocolate's preparation by pre-Olmec peoples as early as 1750 BCE. On the Pacific coast of Chiapas, Mexico, a Mokaya archaeological site provides evidence of cacao beverages dating even earlier, to 1900 BCE. The residues {{and the kind of}} vessel in which they were found indicate the initial use of cacao was not simply as a beverage, but the white pulp around the cacao beans was likely used as a source of <b>fermentable</b> sugars for an alcoholic drink.|$|E
25|$|Pasteur {{performed}} {{several experiments}} to disprove spontaneous generation. He placed boiled liquid in a flask and let hot air enter the flask. Then {{he closed the}} flask, and no organisms grew in it. In another experiment, when he opened flasks containing boiled liquid, dust entered the flasks, causing organisms to grow in some of them. The number of flasks in which organisms grew was lower at higher altitudes, showing that air at high altitudes contained less dust and fewer organisms. Pasteur also used swan neck flasks containing a <b>fermentable</b> liquid. Air was allowed to enter the flask via a long curving tube that made dust particles stick to it. Nothing grew in the broths unless the flasks were tilted, making the liquid touch the contaminated walls of the neck. This showed that the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, on dust, rather than spontaneously generating within the liquid or from the action of pure air.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the normal}} range of volumes of flatus in normal individuals varies hugely (476–1,491ml/24h). All intestinal gas is either swallowed environmental air, present intrinsically in foods and beverages or the result of gut fermentation. Swallowing small amounts of air occurs while eating and drinking. This is emitted from the mouth by eructation (burping) and is normal. Excessive swallowing of environmental air is called aerophagia, and {{has been shown in}} a few case reports to be responsible for increased flatus volume. This is however considered a rare cause of increased flatus volume. Gases contained in food and beverages is likewise emitted largely through eructation, e.g., carbonated beverages. Endogenously produced intestinal gases make up 74 percent of flatus in normal subjects. The volume of gas produced is partially dependent upon the composition of the intestinal microbiota, which is normally very resistant to change, but is also very different in different individuals. Some patients are predisposed to increased endogenous gas production by virtue of their gut microbiota composition. The greatest concentration of gut bacteria is in the colon, while the small intestine is normally near sterile. Fermentation occurs when unabsorbed food residues may arrive in the colon. Therefore, even more than the composition of the microbiota, diet is the primary factor that dictates the volume of flatus produced. Diets that aim {{to reduce the amount of}} undigested <b>fermentable</b> food residues arriving in the colon have been shown to significantly reduce the volume of flatus produced. Again, it is emphasised that increased volume of intestinal gas will not cause bloating and pain in normal subjects. Abnormal intestinal gas dynamics will create pain, distension, and bloating, regardless of whether there is high or low total flatus volume.|$|E
500|$|The {{alcohol in}} beer comes {{primarily}} from the metabolism of sugars that are produced during fermentation. The quantity of <b>fermentable</b> sugars in the wort and the variety of yeast used to ferment the wort are the primary factors that {{determine the amount of}} alcohol in the final beer. Additional <b>fermentable</b> sugars are sometimes added to increase alcohol content, and enzymes are often added to the wort for certain styles of beer (primarily [...] "light" [...] beers) to convert more complex carbohydrates (starches) to <b>fermentable</b> sugars. Alcohol is a by-product of yeast metabolism and is toxic to the yeast; typical brewing yeast cannot survive at alcohol concentrations above 12% by volume. Low temperatures and too little fermentation time decreases the effectiveness of yeasts and consequently decreases the alcohol content.|$|E
500|$|Grodziskie is brewed from {{wheat malt}} {{that has been}} dried by {{circulating}} oak smoke through the grains. [...] The smokiness of the grain and the mineral profile of the water used to brew the beverage gives the style its characteristic flavor. [...] Polish breweries historically used locally grown hops {{and one or two}} strains of brewer's yeast in its production. [...] Before packaging, the beer is filtered to produce a bright, clear appearance. [...] The beer is packaged before all of the <b>fermentable</b> sugars have been converted to alcohol by the yeast, earlier in the process than is typical in beers. [...] Fermentation continues after packaging, and the carbon dioxide that is produced remains dissolved in the beer, resulting in a very high level of carbonation in the final product.|$|E
500|$|The {{digestive}} {{system of the}} horse is somewhat delicate. [...] Horses are unable to regurgitate food, except from the esophagus. [...] Thus, if they overeat or eat something poisonous, vomiting is not an option. [...] They also have a long, complex large intestine and a balance of beneficial microbes in their cecum that can be upset by rapid changes in feed. [...] Because of these factors, they are very susceptible to colic, which is {{a leading cause of}} death in horses. [...] Therefore, horses require clean, high-quality feed, provided at regular intervals, and may become ill if subjected to abrupt changes in their diets. Horses are also sensitive to molds and toxins. [...] For this reason, they must never be fed contaminated <b>fermentable</b> materials such as lawn clippings. [...] Fermented silage or [...] "haylage" [...] is fed to horses in some places; however, contamination or failure of the fermentation process that allows any mold or spoilage may be toxic.|$|E
500|$|The first step, {{where the}} wort is {{prepared}} by mixing the starch source (normally malted barley) with hot water, {{is known as}} [...] "mashing". Hot water (known as [...] "liquor" [...] in brewing terms) is mixed with crushed malt or malts (known as [...] "grist") in a mash tun. The mashing process takes around 1 to 2 hours, during which the starches are converted to sugars, and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains. The grains are now washed in {{a process known as}} [...] "sparging". This washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the <b>fermentable</b> liquid from the grains as possible. The process of filtering the spent grain from the wort and sparge water is called wort separation. The traditional process for wort separation is lautering, in which the grain bed itself serves as the filter medium. Some modern breweries prefer the use of filter frames which allow a more finely ground grist.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the flavor}} {{characteristics}} of Grodziskie {{result from the}} chemical makeup of the water that the breweries used to produce the beer. [...] The water {{from one of the}} wells on Poznańska Street in Grodzisk was tested, and showed a sulfate ion concentration of 183 parts per million (ppm) and a chloride ion concentration of 81 ppm. [...] Alkalinity (as calcium bicarbonate) was 350 ppm and the magnesium ion concentration was 34 ppm. [...] Using this type of water to produce beer would result in a higher than expected hop flavor because of the high alkalinity and the ratio of sulfate ions to chloride ions. [...] During the early stages of production, this water would have a higher pH, which would inhibit the efficiency of the natural enzymes that convert the starch in the grain to <b>fermentable</b> sugars during mashing. [...] The result is a beer with more unfermented sugars and lower average alcohol content. [...] Finally, the water would have contributed a slightly sour or bitter flavor to the beer, due to the high concentration of magnesium ions.|$|E
500|$|Sugar, starch, cotton, linen, hemp, {{some types}} of rope, wood and {{particle}} boards, papyrus and paper, vegetable oils, wax, and natural rubber are examples of commercially important materials made from plant tissues or their secondary products. Charcoal, a pure form of carbon made by pyrolysis of wood, {{has a long history}} as a metal-smelting fuel, as a filter material and adsorbent and as an artist's material {{and is one of the}} three ingredients of gunpowder. Cellulose, the world's most abundant organic polymer, can be converted into energy, fuels, materials and chemical feedstock. Products made from cellulose include rayon and cellophane, wallpaper paste, biobutanol and gun cotton. Sugarcane, rapeseed and soy are some of the plants with a highly <b>fermentable</b> sugar or oil content that are used as sources of biofuels, important alternatives to fossil fuels, such as biodiesel. [...] Sweetgrass was used by NativeAmericanse to ward of bugs like mosquitoes. These bug repelling properties of sweetgrass were later found by the American Chemical Society in the molecules phytol and coumarin.|$|E
