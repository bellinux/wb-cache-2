5|$|The aircrew had {{an unusually}} high ratio of crew to {{passengers}}, as six <b>deadheading</b> crew were on board. Twelve passengers occupied the upper deck first class, while in business almost all of 24 seats were taken; in economy class, approximately 80 seats did not contain passengers. There were 22 {{children under the age}} of 12 years aboard. One hundred and thirty passengers planned to connect to other destinations such as Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Taipei.|$|E

25|$|Dahlias grow {{naturally}} in climates {{which do not}} experience frost (the tubers are hardy to USDA Zone 8), consequently they are not adapted to withstand sub-zero temperatures. However, their tuberous nature enables them to survive periods of dormancy, and this characteristic means that gardeners in temperate climates with frosts can grow dahlias successfully, provided the tubers are lifted {{from the ground and}} stored in cool yet frost-free conditions during the winter. Planting the tubers quite deep (10 – 15cm) also provides some protection. When in active growth, modern dahlia hybrids perform most successfully in well-watered yet free-draining soils, in situations receiving plenty of sunlight. Taller cultivars usually require some form of staking as they grow, and all garden dahlias need <b>deadheading</b> regularly, once flowering commences.|$|E
500|$|Although [...] "difficult to grow under cultivation", The Royal Horticultural Society states Eriophorum angustifolium can be {{cultivated}} as a low-maintenance wildflower, {{suitable for}} meadows, ponds margins or bog gardens. This may {{be done in}} sheltered or exposed terrain, but best accomplished with full sun at a south- or west-facing aspect, in water up to [...] deep. Poorly-drained peat, sand, clay or loam with an acidic soil pH is required. Division in spring is the recommended form of propagation for the species, and regular <b>deadheading</b> is the recommended method of pruning. Narthecium ossifragum and Myrica gale are suitable for companion planting with E.angustifolium. Eriophorum angustifolium is [...] "generally pest free". As a seedling and young plant it is eaten by sheep and cattle, {{and a variety of}} goose species. It is tolerant to chalybeate (iron-enriched) water, but may succumb to powdery mildews.|$|E

500|$|Attempted mergers of Community Transit with Everett Transit {{have been}} {{proposed}} by the Washington State Legislature and the CT Board since the formation of SNOTRAN in 1974. The relative success of Community Transit in the late 1970s and 1980s prompted the Community Transit Board to propose consolidation with Everett Transit in 1988, though long-term planning under SNOTRAN for both agencies worked {{under the assumption that}} there would be no merger by 2000. In 1990, a second proposal was rejected by the Everett City Council after consultants determined that a merger would only save $350,000 per year in <b>deadheading</b> for Community Transit and that both staffs would need to be retained because of the lack of service duplication between the two agencies. Throughout the 1990s, successive legislative bills proposing a merger were passed through the House Transportation Committee, but failed to gain support elsewhere because of successful lobbying from the City of Everett. State voters approved Referendum 49 in November 1998, including state motor-vehicle excise tax revenue for city-run transit in Everett and Yakima. While Everett Transit gained $4.5 million (equivalent to $ in [...] ) in new annual funding, CT was set to lose $1 million (equivalent to $ in [...] ) over the next five years in addition to the $2 million (equivalent to $ in [...] ) used to operate service within Everett annually. The large cuts brought on by the passing of Initiative 695 and subsequent loss of excise tax revenue forced both agencies to consider merging in 2000, with savings of an estimated $1.7 million per year (equivalent to $ in [...] ) according to a study commissioned by Community Transit. As a result of the failed mergers, CT proposed truncating its routes at Everett city limits, but ultimately decided to provide limited-stop service on its routes through Everett to the newly constructed Everett Station in 2002. Community Transit and Everett Transit signed their first partnership agreement in 2007, with Everett helping fund Swift bus rapid transit through its service area and allowing CT to operate the route in exchange for the expansion of ET service into unincorporated areas surrounding Everett. The two agencies further collaborated with Sound Transit and the Washington State Department of Transportation in the construction of the South Everett Freeway Station the following year.|$|E

He then forged a Federal Aviation Administration pilot's license. Pan Am estimated that between the ages of 16 and 18, Abagnale flew more than [...] on more than 250 flights and flew to 26 countries by <b>deadheading.</b> As a company pilot, he was also able to stay at hotels for free during this time.
