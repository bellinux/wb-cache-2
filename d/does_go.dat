25|$|Here Wordsworth expresses that in {{the mood}} of the sublime, the burden of the world is lifted. In a lot of these cases, Wordsworth finds the sublime in Nature. He finds the awe in the {{beautiful}} forms of nature, but he also finds terror. Wordsworth experiences both aspects of the sublime. However, he <b>does</b> <b>go</b> beyond Burke or Kant's definition of the literary sublime, for his ultimate goal is to find Enlightenment within the sublime.|$|E
25|$|In the lead-up to the 2017 tournament, the ICC had {{proposed}} starting an ODI League in 2019, which {{will most likely}} lead to the Champions Trophy getting scrapped. If the 2021 Champions Trophy <b>does</b> <b>go</b> ahead, it is due to be played in India. Following the 2017 Champions Trophy, David Richardson (the ICC CEO) stated that the future status of the Champions Trophy was undecided, with both a possible Test league and an additional World T20 putting additional pressure of fixtures.|$|E
25|$|Relative {{humidity}} has a {{diurnal range}} in the high 90s {{in the early morning}} to around 60% in the mid-afternoon, but <b>does</b> <b>go</b> below 50% at times. In May 2009, the average relative humidity was 81%, an increase over the figure of 77.1% in May 2008. During prolonged heavy rain, relative humidity often reaches 100%. Generally, there is much more rainfall on the western side of the island than on the eastern portion of Singapore, owing to a rain shadow effect.|$|E

25|$|To give an example, two chess players {{might be}} engaged in a bitter {{struggle}} at the board, but they share all sorts of Background presuppositions: that they will take turns to move, {{that no one else}} will intervene, that they are both playing to the same rules, that the fire alarm won't go off, that the board won't suddenly disintegrate, that their opponent won't magically turn into a grapefruit, and so on indefinitely. As most of these possibilities won't have occurred to either player, Searle thinks the Background must be unconscious, though elements of it can be called to consciousness (if the fire alarm <b>does</b> <b>go</b> off, say).|$|E

Grace, Trevor and Joe plan to lock Fraser in the vehicle and release poisonous gas to kill him. Grace betrays Joe and plans to frame him solely for the crime and also ensure Sandy dies too.

25|$|In {{his first}} term, Sharif funded Pakistan's nuclear, missile and space programme, {{as well as}} allotted funds for the science research, {{particularly}} its extension to defence. In May 1998, soon after Indian nuclear tests, Sharif vowed that his country would give a suitable reply to the Indians. On 14 May, Leader of the Opposition Benazir Bhutto and MQM publicly called for the nuclear tests and the public calls for the nuclear test as well began {{to take place in}} Pakistan. When India tested its nuclear weapons the second time, it caused a great alarm in Pakistan and pressure mounted to build on the Prime minister. On 15 May 1998, Sharif called and chaired a National Security Council meeting in Prime minister Secretariat. The Pakistan Armed Forces left the matter to elected Prime minister, though Prime minister Sharif put the Pakistan Armed Forces on high-alert. The discussions went on for a few hours and encompassed the financial, diplomatic, military, strategic and national security concerns. At this sensitive meeting, it has had two important agendas; first, whether or not Pakistan should conduct its nuclear tests to respond to Indian nuclear aggression. And, secondly, if the nuclear testing program <b>does</b> <b>go</b> ahead then which of the government science organisations— the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission or Kahuta Research Laboratories— conduct the nuclear testing as well as leading the nuclear testing program.|$|E

A its preview was shown as part of Cartoon Network's shorts development initiative. The series revolves around the title character, who is simultaneously the grandfather and uncle of everyone in the world. Browngardt explained that while the new series would retain some aspects of Secret Mountain, {{it would be a}} more lighthearted adaption for children. He ultimately expressed that he wanted [...] "more variety in the music and be able to go [...] sort of a happier place, though it <b>does</b> <b>go</b> dark and heavy at times".|$|E
500|$|By 1834, {{the castle}} was un{{occupied}} again. In 1840, an advert {{was placed in}} the Newcastle Courant by Revd.

The school {{does not seem to have}} existed for long as Howitt commented in 1842, that it was [...] "a scene of great desolation... the windows for the most part, all along the front, are boarded up... the whole of this large old house is now empty... and in the most desolate state". However, he <b>does</b> <b>go</b> on to say the kitchen was occupied a poor family. By 1844, the chapel was used as a carpenter's workshop, and according to the Durham Chronicle in January 1856, the castle set on fire while in the occupation of a farmer, Mr. Maclaren.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of {{media coverage of}} the event was deferential. Most major news organizations broadcast the various events live multiple times; during the week, the cable channel C-SPAN broadcast uninterrupted coverage of the funeral ceremonies. A few complained, however, that the television coverage was excessive and preempted coverage of other events. CBS News anchor Dan Rather was quoted as saying: [...] "Even though everybody is respectful and wants to pay homage to the president, life <b>does</b> <b>go</b> on. There is other news, like the reality of Iraq. It got very short shrift this weekend." [...] Throughout the week, media experts reported that the national mourning, televised nearly non-stop on many television networks, provided Americans welcome respite from unhappy reports that American troops were being killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, giving them a sense of good news they had been desperate for since the September 11 attacks.|$|E

500|$|IGN's Cliff Wheatley gave All Hail the King a 9.4 out of 10. He {{said that}} it's [...] "a {{return to the}} loveable {{personality}} of the hapless Trevor and a step forward for the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has its twists that should satisfy both lovers and haters of Trevor Slattery. But it’s the approach that Pearce takes with the material, from the kung-fu movie style credit sequences to the light-hearted tone that takes a sudden and jarring turn. Kingsley once again shines {{in the role of}} Slattery, aloof and ignorant, but more than happy to slide back into Mandarin mode if it will please his adoring fans. Pearce <b>does</b> <b>go</b> for some of the same jokes from Iron Man 3 in a sort of referential way, but it’s nothing too damaging." [...] Andrew Wheeler of Comics Alliance criticized the way homosexuality was presented in the short, given it was Marvel Studios' first attempt to bring LGBT concepts into the MCU.|$|E
500|$|In a 2000 Entertainment Weekly review, Marc Bernadin complimented {{the show}} on its [...] "spot-on pop-culture acumen" [...] and [...] "unparalleled sense of fun", giving it a warm welcome from earlier [...] "lame" [...] superhero {{cartoons}} that he grew up with. Peter Marks of The New York Times noted the show's use of adult humor and pop culture references, declaring it [...] "the sort of playful satire that can appeal as much to a viewer of 37 as 7." [...] Joly Herman of Common Sense Media describes the show as a [...] "cute, highly stylized series thrills the senses with its strange characters, funny situations, and lots of lowbrow humor". She goes on to say, however, that the show <b>does</b> <b>go</b> from innocent to violent in no time {{and that there is}} not much protecting young viewers against the violent undertones.

He nevertheless saw set-pieces {{as an opportunity to}} score goals from and felt the equaliser turned the final in his team's favour: [...] "Suddenly the confidence switches to the other camp. They're affected, they become a bit unsettled, and you keep going." [...] Houllier revealed he gave a frank assessment of the task facing his players before the match; although in his words Arsenal were [...] "...probably a bit better than us, probably more mature, more experienced, more ability in some areas," [...] dealing with setbacks would make the difference on the day. He dismissed accusations that Liverpool were boring, rather describing his team as difficult to beat. Owen, the match winner, felt he answered his critics by scoring left-footed: [...] "It's nice to prove people wrong when they say you haven't got a left foot. I {{was supposed to be the}} worst header and the worst player with my left foot in the league, and how could an England player play when they haven't got a left foot....

500|$|The two {{industrial}} revolutions {{first and}} second combined with advancements made {{during the war years}} resulted in the largest impetus in highway construction of all weather roads following World War II. [...] The creation of the highway south of Chamberlain to Moose Jaw was completed in 1953. Paving projects followed within a short time period. [...] In 1955 parts of Highway 2 were already paved; Between Vantage and Tuxford, either side of Moose Jaw; north of Watrous along the Little Manitou Lake shoreline; and north of the junction with Highway 27 to Montreal Lake, either side of Prince Albert. In 1956 a North-South International Highway proposal regarding a highway between El Paso, Texas, and LaRonge via Wakaw was discussed. The CanAm Highway northern segment into La Ronge finished construction in 1977; however, the CanAm didn't go through Wakaw, rather it comprised several different routes making the CanAm. Highway 2, which <b>does</b> <b>go</b> through Wakaw, does link to the CanAm highway at Prince Albert when Highway 2 becomes the last portion of the CanAm highway. In 1952, Highway 2 was re-routed; rather than winding its way through the town of Wakaw, the highway's new route went straight along the western limit of town.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were [...] mostly mixed, calling the storyline [...] "a string of poorly {{executed}} jokes with some mild successes sprinkled here and there."
