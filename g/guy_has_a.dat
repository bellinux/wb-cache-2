500|$|... "Worst Episode Ever" [...] {{was written}} by Larry Doyle and {{directed}} by Matthew Nastuk. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on February4,2001. The episode was originally called [...] "The Fiver", {{a reference to a}} scene in the episode that was eventually removed. The episode title was then changed to [...] "Worst Episode Ever", a title which the staff were amused by. According to Doyle, [...] "Worst Episode Ever" [...] is the first episode in which Comic Book <b>Guy</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> major role. Because Comic Book Guy is usually sarcastic and unfriendly, the series' staff found it hard to make the character seem likable. For example, Hank Azaria, who plays Comic Book Guy among other characters in the series, had a difficult time trying to make the character sound sincere. [...] "Comic Book Guy only ever pronounces things sarcastically", Azaria said in the DVD commentary for the episode. [...] "It was hard {{to find a way to}} sound believable and have him say sincere things. It took a lot of different takes." [...] Executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully said, [...] "It's tough when you take a character like Comic Book Guy or Krusty or Moe, to make them suddenly sympathetic and vulnerable. You have to cheat the character a little bit to open them up emotionally a little more." ...|$|E
2500|$|Contrary to the {{opinions}} {{of some of his}} enemies, who never tire to credit Leitner's poetry with supposed incomprehensibility, other commentators – such as the Süddeutsche Zeitung – have given quite different assessments of his work. With respect to his poetry collection The Truth about Uncle Spam (German: Die Wahrheit über Uncle Spam), critics from that newspaper wrote: [...] " [...] is playfully light and aerial [...] because he does not trust in false claims to intellectual depth, his miniatures are wonderful reads." [...] While earlier in his career, he was called [...] "pessimistic," [...] critics such as [...] have recently honored him with the title of Jokester: [...] "Leitner wants to unearth the madness and idiocy that surrounds us every day, but he does so playfully, without any kind of moralistic resentment or invectives." [...] Numerous critics have remarked on Leitner's enlightened irony. In a review of Der digitale Hai ist high (German for The Digital Shark is High), Peter Kapp wrote in the Rheinische Post: [...] "by means of hearty verbal wit and twisted word play, Leitner incites a lust for poetry." [...] Leitner does not hide behind fictions of seriousness: [...] "the publisher and publicist [...] does not care very much for the widely held notion that poetry is something for quiet retreats. He thinks that poetry is part of everyday life and should be fun." [...] In his preface to Der digitale Hai ist high Günter Kunert wrote, [...] "It's rare that a poet brings together three special qualities in his personality, {{as in the case of}} Anton G. Leitner. That <b>guy</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> feeling for the language; he has a lust for the language; he's obsessed with sex—where else do these three qualities come together? Humor, wit, and common sense. This is a mixture that can rarely be found in German poetry." ...|$|E

5000|$|I got an {{objection}} from {{the editor of}} a gay newspaper in London - he actually said it was below the belt.

[...] "This <b>guy</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> real, actually much better sense of humor than the Comedian did," [...] avouched Morgan. [...] "He’s not nihilistic. It’s completely different. This is much lighter. A much lighter load for me.
