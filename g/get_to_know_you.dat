25|$|For a {{few years}} we've been {{trying to come up}} with a way for the readers of this site to connect and {{interact}} with each other, to get to know each other better, for me to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> better, and for little bunnies to fart sunshine. The comments section has sort of worked in this capacity, but not very well and not to the extent that it should. So we (meaning the team I introduced above) have put together a new section of this website where we can all pool our knowledge and experiences and drunken mishaps into one highly accessible and fun place.|$|E
500|$|Watch Me Disappear was Augie March's most {{mainstream}} pop work to date, {{described as}} a further distillation of the band's earlier, even more complex, music. Richards considered it to be more streamlined than their early work, despite their attempts to maintain a sense of spontaneity. Zuel also noted a removal {{of much of the}} backing instrumentation which had acted as [...] "clutter" [...] around Richards' vocals on earlier work. Scott Podmore wrote in the Herald Sun that the album did not have a standout song or an instant appeal but that it was [...] "a slow burner that takes time to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>you,</b> but once it does, it's a friend for good". Triple J reviewer Jenny Valentish argued that multiple songs from the album could take the place of [...] "One Crowded Hour" [...] as [...] "likely to become wailed for and misquoted at festivals". She noted a [...] "commercial potential" [...] for the album, despite its more disconcerting and confrontational content.|$|E

Although {{it was not an}} official Olympic anthem for the Games in Los Angeles that summer, it was a worldwide hit. It reached Number 4 in the UK Singles Chart. The sleeve featured the song title in ten different languages while Jones sang the title line in French and German on the extended 12" [...] version. The song also appeared in the film Better Off Dead (1985) and the video game [...] (2006).|$|E

'You see, Cousin Charity,' said Jonas, 'nobody but you {{can tell}} her what pains I took to get into her company when you were both at the boarding-house in the city, because nobody's so well aware of it, you know.

I always asked you about her, and said where had she gone, and when would she come, and how lively she was, and all that; didn't I, cousin? I know you'll tell her so, if you haven't told her so already, and--and--I dare say you have, because I'm sure you're honourable, ain't you?' ...|$|E

That is, if I can <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>you.</b> You commence by enthusing on philosophy: I hasten to agree with you. It is a noble science. When my youngest daughter has grown up, when the other one has learnt a little sense, when Dick is off my hands, and the British public has come to appreciate good literature, I am hoping to {{be a bit of a}} philosopher myself. But before I can explain to you my views you have already changed your own, and are likening the philosopher to an old tom-cat that seems to be weak in his head. Soberly now, what are you?" ...|$|E

By-the-by, have I told you both exactly why Mr. Hamel is a guest here to-night--why he came to these parts at all? No? Listen, then. He came to take possession of the Tower. The worst of it is that it belongs to him, too. His father bought it from your father more years ago than we should care to talk about. I have really been a trespasser all this time." ...|$|E

40|$|The present project {{investigated}} the social competency of anger-prone individuals in both non-anger-provoking and anger-provoking situations.

You crossed Sloane Square, turned up King's Road, and finally arrived here. I followed. I saw a notice up, [...] "Studio to Let".

60|$|I {{suppose the}} same thing holds good with the hosts; they seldom {{have more than a}} {{superficial}} acquaintance with their guests, and so often just when they do <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> a bit better, they leave off knowing you altogether. There was rather a breath of winter in the air when I left those Dorsetshire people. You see, they had asked me down to shoot, and I'm not particularly immense at that sort of thing. There's such a deadly sameness about partridges; when you've missed one, you've missed the lot--at least, that's been my experience. And they tried to rag me in the smoking-room {{about not being able to}} hit a bird at five yards, a sort of bovine ragging that suggested cows buzzing round a gadfly and thinking they were teasing it. So I got up the next morning at early dawn--I know it was dawn, because there were lark-noises in the sky, and the grass looked as if it had been left out all night--and hunted up the most conspicuous thing in the bird line that I could find, and measured the distance, as nearly as it would let me, and shot away all I knew. They said afterwards that it was a tame bird; that's simply silly, because it was awfully wild at the first few shots. Afterwards it quieted down a bit, and when its legs had stopped waving farewells to the landscape I got a gardener-boy to drag it into the hall, where everybody must see it on their way to the breakfast-room. I breakfasted upstairs myself. I gathered afterwards that the meal was tinged with a very unchristian spirit. I suppose it's unlucky to bring peacock's feathers into a house; anyway, there was a blue-pencilly look in my hostess's eye when I took my departure.|$|E
