500|$|In {{his review}} of Harrison's 1987 album Cloud Nine, for Creem magazine, Bill Holdship {{included}} the track among the [...] "scattered brilliant moments" [...] of Harrison's career post-All Things Must Pass, saying: [...] "'You' from the Extra Texture LP sounds like punk (<b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> definition) pop as Phil Spector might've done it, and remains a killer to this day. And when I saw Harrison perform in 1974, {{he put on a}} far better show than the one I would later see Wings do." [...] Writing in the posthumous Rolling Stone Press tribute, Harrison, in 2002, Mikal Gilmore similarly identified [...] "You" [...] as a highlight of the artist's work in the mid to late 1970s. In the same publication, Greg Kot deemed it to be [...] "a terrific single", adding: [...] "Its roaring Wall of Sound arrangement suits Harrison well, right down to its closing quote of the Ronettes' 'Be My Baby'." [...] In a January 2002 review of Harrison's solo releases, for Goldmine magazine, Dave Thompson described the song as [...] "magnificent".|$|E
500|$|On March 31, Houston paused his men at Groce's Landing, roughly [...] {{north of}} San Felipe. [...] Two {{companies}} {{that refused to}} retreat further than San Felipe were assigned to guard the crossings on the Brazos River. [...] For the next two weeks, the Texians rested, recovered from illness, and, for the first time, began practicing military drills. [...] While there, two cannons, known as the Twin Sisters, arrived from Cincinnati, Ohio. [...] Interim Secretary of War Thomas Rusk joined the camp, with orders from Burnet to replace Houston if he refused to fight. Houston quickly persuaded Rusk that his plans were sound. Secretary of State Samuel P. Carson advised Houston to continue retreating {{all the way to}} the Sabine River, where more volunteers would likely flock from the United States and allow the army to counterattack. [...] Unhappy with everyone involved, Burnet wrote to Houston: [...] "The enemy are laughing you to scorn. You must fight them. You must retreat no further. The country expects you to fight. The salvation of the country <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> doing so." [...] Complaints within the camp became so strong that Houston posted notices that anyone attempting to usurp his position would be court-martialed and shot.|$|E
500|$|On October 15, Madonna threw a pre-release {{party at}} New York City's Industria Superstudio, and signed all the invitations under her Sex alter ego [...] "Dita". During the party, Madonna showed up dressed as Little Bo Peep and even carried {{with her a}} stuffed toy lamb. Madonna's {{publicist}} Liz Rosenberg showed concern at first due to [...] "what the parents of America's impressionable teens will soon be thinking" [...] but later said that it [...] "all <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> idea of lovemaking, which in Madonna's case, should give {{new meaning to the}} word erotic". Both Waldenbooks and Barnes & Noble prepared corporate statements that the managers could share with customers who are offended by Sex. (Both statements defended the right of bookstores to provide [...] "diversity and choice" [...] to customers and say censorship is not the role of bookstores.) Many book stores, too, stated that the book would not be sold to anyone under 18 {{and that it would be}} for display only behind the cash register. Bookstore owner David Epstein stated that [...] "The feeling of most people who have ordered the book is that Madonna is something special, that this is cutting-edge art, , they're not the kind of people who are buying it because it's smut and dirty pictures. People are interested in it as art." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{organisation}} {{was unique}} {{in the history of}} the Camorra in that it was highly centralised and possessed a rudimentary form of ideology. For example, he publicly declared that children were not to be kidnapped or mistreated and allegedly arranged the assassination of at least one kidnapper. Perhaps the most potent ideological weapon was the cult of violence, which sometimes bordered on a kind of death wish, as Cutolo once wrote: [...] "the value of a life doesn’t consist of its length but in the use made of it; often people live a long time without living very much.

It's not a sign of creativity to have 65 ideas for one problem, that's just a waste of energy. I also don't think you need to go anywhere particular to be creative; people just use that as an excuse. But I do think a lot of creativity <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> relationships with other people, your personal relationships, your partner or whatever.

2500|$|A {{doctor at}} the Minzu {{hospital}} in Nanning city {{said that the}} hospital did not currently have Falun Gong organs available, {{but that he had}} previously selected Falun Gong prisoners for organ harvesting. The doctor also advised the caller to contact a university hospital in neighboring Guangdong province, saying that they had better channels to obtain Falun Gong organs. At the Zhongshan hospital in Shanghai, a doctor told investigators that all his hospital's organs were sourced from Falun Gong practitioners. During an April 2006 phone call to a military hospital in Guangzhou, a doctor told investigators that he had “several batches” of Falun Gong organs, but that the supply could run dry after 20 May 2006. In another call, investigators posed as an organ broker to call the Jinzhou city people’s court.

[...] Khomeini pleaded women to participate in anti-Shah demonstrations in various cities. Furthermore, women later responded to Khomeini’s urge to vote in favor of the Islamic Republic and new constitution cities. Women were so pivotal to the revolution that in response to a suggestion from a top aid to ban women from coming to group audience, Khomeini said [...] "I threw the shah out with these women, there's no problem in their coming." ...|$|E
