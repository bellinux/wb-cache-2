5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{spray forming}} work {{was based on}} a resistively heated electric <b>holding</b> <b>furnace.</b> The melt then passed through a 3 mm diameter Al2O3 nozzle. However the low flow rate made a high superheat necessary to prevent solidification in the nozzle. The next generation melting procedures in spray forming applications were bottom pour induction units, which offer many benefits. In this system, the melting crucible is directly above the atomiser head with a ceramic nozzle feeding directly from the furnace to the atomiser. A stopper rod runs through the melt {{to the top of the}} pouring nozzle, the rod is withdrawn when the melt reaches the designated temperature for spraying, typically 50 to 150 C above the alloy's liquidus. Alternatively a pre-prepared plug of alloy to block the nozzle is used, and at a specified superheat this plug melts allowing the contents of the furnace to drain through the nozzle. Another problem associated with bottom pour furnaces is the change in flow rate associated with the reducing metalo-static head in the crucible. In some cases, introducing an inert gas overpressure during pouring can compensate for this effect.|$|E
40|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{generation}} capacity and high energy intensities South Africa's electricity supplier is forced to shut down high energy users frequently. Power cuts as well as escalating electricity prices threaten the country's steel industry. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify cost-effective energy efficiency improvements for the South African foundry industry. A lack of research in South African foundries was identified as existing literature on the topic was analysed. A large foundry operating an induction furnace in the Western Cape served as subjects to investigate the topic specifically in South Africa. The aim was to identify the energy intensity, evaluate already implemented energy efficiency measures and identify further opportunities to reduce energy cost of the foundry. The method followed for the data collection was much orientated on an industry energy audit. Types of energy, amounts and cost of energy usage were determined. The energy consumption and energy intensity of the foundry were analysed, based on meter readings, electricity bills and where necessarily a "bottom-up" approach for estimation was used. Results of the energy audit have shown that the foundry under review consumes about 127, 000 MWh annually with a maximum demand of 26, 500 kVA. The already implemented energy saving measures decreased the company's energy usage by 5 % resulting in a current energy intensity of 1, 493 ZAR/ton. Further proposed energy efficiency measures included the compressed air system, preheating of the charge material and the reduction of the <b>holding</b> <b>furnaces</b> were analysed. The results of all evaluated measures, namely lighting, load-shifting and maximum demand management were cost effective solutions. Furthermore the recommended energy efficiency measures, namely reduction of compressed air leaks, reduction of <b>holding</b> <b>furnaces</b> as well as preheating of charge material, showed in theoretical calculations a reduction of carbon emissions as well as cost savings.

40|$|Due to {{increased}} globalisation, industries are facing greater competition that is pressing companies into decreasing their expenses {{in order to}} increase their profits. As regards Swedish industry, it has been faced with substantial increases in energy prices in recent years. Barriers to energy efficiency such as imperfect information inhibit investments in energy efficiency measures, energy audits being one means of reducing barriers and overcoming imperfect information. However, an evaluation of such energy audits in Sweden reveals that it is chiefly low-cost measures that are undertaken {{as a result of an}} audit. Moreover, these audits often tend to focus on support processes such as ventilation, lighting, air compressors etc., while measures impacting production processes are often not as extensively covered, which underlines the need for further support in addition to energy audits. Decision support is practised in a variety of different disciplines such as optimization and simulation and the aim of this paper is to explore whether investment decision support practices may be used successfully towards small and medium-sized manufacturers in Sweden when complex production-related investment decisions are taken. The optimization results from the different cases, involving a foundryâs investment in a new melting unit, indicate that with no electricity price fluctuations over the day, the investment seems sound as it lowers the overall energy costs. However, with fluctuating electricity prices, there are no large differences in energy costs between the option of retaining the existing five melting furnaces at the foundry and investing in a twin furnace and removing the <b>holding</b> <b>furnaces</b> â which was the initial investment plan for the foundry in the study. It would not have been possible to achieve this outcome without the use of investment decision support such as MIND. One of the main conclusions in this paper is that investment decision support, when strategic investment decisions are to be taken, may be a means of emphasising energy efficiency for energy-intensive SMEs beyond the level of traditional energy auditing.

40|$|Abstract: Chlorine gas is {{traditionally}} used for fluxing of aluminum melt for removal of alkali and alkaline earth elements. However {{this results in}} undesirable emissions of particulate matter and gases such as HCl and chlorine, which are often at unacceptable levels. Additionally, chlorine gas is highly toxic and its handling, storage, and use pose risks to employees and the local community. Holding of even minimal amounts of chlorine necessitates extensive training for all plant employees. Fugitive emissions from chlorine usage within the plant cause accelerated corrosion of plant equipment. The Secondary Aluminum Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) under the Clean Air Act, finalized in March 2000 has set very tough new limits on particulate matter (PM) and total hydrogen chloride emissions from aluminum melting and <b>holding</b> <b>furnaces.</b> These limits are 0. 4 and 0. 1 lbs per ton of aluminum for hydrogen chloride and particulate emissions, respectively. Assuming new technologies for meeting these limits can be found, additional requirements under the Clean Air Act (Prevention of Significant Deterioration and New Source Review) trigger Best Available Control Technology (BACT) for new sources with annual emissions (net emissions not expressed per ton of production) over specified amounts. BACT currently is lime coated bag-houses for control of particulate and HCl emissions. These controls are expensive, difficult to operate and maintain, and result in reduced American competitiveness in the global economy. Solid salt fluxing is emerging as a viable option for the replacement of chlorine gas fluxing, provided emissions can be consistently maintained below the required levels. This project was a cooperative effort between the Ohio State University and Alcoa to investigate and optimize the effects of solid chloride flux addition in molten metal for alkali impurity and non-metallic inclusion removal minimizing dust and toxic emissions and maximizing energy conservation. In this program, the salt metal interactions were studies and the emissions at laboratory scale at OSU were monitored.
