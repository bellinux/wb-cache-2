40|$|There {{are many}} {{historic}} buildings whose construction {{is based on}} timber <b>frame</b> <b>walls.</b> Most buildings built during the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries were based on timber <b>frame</b> <b>walls</b> with vertical support elements. These timber frame elements are affected by their moisture content and by the passage of time. If the interaction of the timber <b>frame</b> <b>walls</b> with hygrothermal fluctuations were known, the maintenance of these buildings could be improved significantly. To determine the moisture content of wood there are two types of meters on the market: on the one hand, capacitance meters which consist of two side ends and where the moisture content is measured locally between two peaks. On the other hand, there are meters based on the variation of electromagnetic transmittance of timber, which depends on the moisture of timber. The second ones are very expensive and difficult to handle. This work presents a new non-intrusive capacitive sensor that measures the global moisture content in a section of the timber <b>frame</b> <b>walls</b> and therefore its accuracy is similar to the accuracy that can be obtained with electromagnetic transmittance meters. Additionally, as it is a capacitive sensor, it is low cost and easy to operate...|$|R

40|$|Traditional timber <b>frame</b> <b>walls</b> are {{constructive}} elements {{representative of}} different timber frame buildings {{that are well}} {{known as one of}} the most efficient seismic resistant structures in the world. Timber <b>frame</b> <b>walls</b> were also used in the reconstruction of buildings of the old town of Lisbon after the earthquake of 1755 aiming at improving their seismic global behaviour. As it is important to preserve these structures, a better knowledge about their behaviour under seismic actions is important and can give some indications about possible retrofitting techniques to be used to improve the seismic performance. Due to the great rehabilitation effort currently carried out in many countries, a better understanding of retrofitting techniques is also needed. Therefore, this paper aims at providing a study on possible retrofitting techniques adopting traditional solutions such as bolts and steel plates.

50|$|The {{purposes}} of the walls in buildings are to support roofs, floors and ceilings; to enclose a space {{as part of the}} building envelope along with a roof to give buildings form; and to provide shelter and security. In addition, the wall may house various types of utilities such as electrical wiring or plumbing. Wall construction falls into two basic categories: <b>framed</b> <b>walls</b> or mass-walls. In <b>framed</b> <b>walls</b> the load is transferred to the foundation through posts, columns or studs. <b>Framed</b> <b>walls</b> most often have three or more separate components: the structural elements (such as 2×4 studs in a house wall), insulation, and finish elements or surfaces (such as drywall or panelling). Mass-walls are of a solid material including masonry, concrete including slipform stonemasonry, log building, cordwood construction, adobe, rammed earth, cob, earthbag construction, bottles, tin cans, straw-bale construction, and ice.|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this work {{was to develop a}} {{thermally}} enhanced <b>frame</b> <b>wall</b> that would reduce peak load air conditioning demand, shift a portion of the thermal load, and conserve energy in residential buildings. A <b>frame</b> <b>wall</b> containing macroencapsulated phase-change materials (PCMs), incorporated therein, was developed, constructed, and evaluated. This prototype wall is referred to as - phase-change <b>frame</b> <b>wall</b> (PCFW). A PCFW is a typical <b>frame</b> <b>wall,</b> consisting of outside siding, thermal insulation, studs, and inside sheathing, in which PCMs are incorporated, by macroencapsulation, to enhance the energy storage capabilities of the wall, and thus thermal mass of the building, via the high latent heat of fusion of the PCMs. The PCFW uses off-the-shelf components, which are herein integrated in an innovative way to produce better energy performance. Results from field testing show that the PCFW offers the potential to reduce wall peak heat flux by as much as 38 %. This value is dependent on climate, wall orientation, quantity of PCM, and wall insulation level. Over a period of days, the average wall peak heat flux reduction was approximately 15 % when PCFWs facing four cardinal directions (i. e., N, S, E, W) were evaluated when 10 % 1 concentration of PCM was used and approximately 9 % when 20 % PCM concentration was used. The average space-cooling load was reduced by approximately 8. 6 % when 10 % PCM was applied and 10. 8 % when 20 % was used. The level of fiberglass insulation in the PCFW was R- 11 (1. 94 m 2 K/W). Although <b>frame</b> <b>wall</b> technology was used as a structural vehicle for this project, the concept could also be applied in almost any building structure, including structural insulated panels, and concrete and masonry buildings.

40|$|Light {{gauge steel}} <b>frame</b> <b>wall</b> systems are {{commonly}} used in industrial and commercial buildings, {{and there is a}} need for simple fire design rules to predict their load capacities and fire resistance ratings. During fire events, the light gauge steel <b>frame</b> <b>wall</b> studs are subjected to non-uniform temperature distributions that cause thermal bowing, neutral axis shift and magnification effects and thus resulting in a combined axial compression and bending action on the studs. In this research, a series of full-scale fire tests was conducted first to evaluate the performance of light gauge steel <b>frame</b> <b>wall</b> systems with eight different wall configurations under standard fire conditions. Finite element models of light gauge steel frame walls were then developed, analysed under transient and steady-state conditions and validated using full-scale fire tests. Using the results from fire tests and finite element analyses, a detailed investigation was undertaken into the prediction of axial compression strength and failure times of light gauge steel <b>frame</b> <b>wall</b> studs in standard fires using the available fire design rules based on Australian, American and European standards. The results from both fire tests and finite element analyses were used to investigate the ability of these fire design rules to include the complex effects of non-uniform temperature distributions and their accuracy in predicting the axial compression strength of wall studs and the failure times. Suitable modifications were then proposed to the fire design rules.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Studies {{have shown}} that {{convective}} air flow can significantly reduce the thermal resistance of frame walls insulated with mineral fibre insulation (MFI). It {{has also been shown}} that convective air flow can be avoided if the MFI products are installed with at least one face against an air impermeable material.

40|$|Recently an {{innovative}} composite panel system was developed, where a thin insulation layer was used externally between two plasterboards {{to improve the}} fire performance of light gauge cold-formed steel frame walls. In this research, finite-element thermal models of both the traditional light gauge cold-formed steel <b>frame</b> <b>wall</b> panels with cavity insulation and the new light gauge cold-formed steel frame composite wall panels were developed to simulate their thermal behaviour under standard and realistic fire conditions.

40|$|Energy use in {{buildings}} {{accounts for a}} significant part of the energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. New building regulations and new measures have been introduced to improve the energy efficiency of buildings. The passive house concept has been suggested as the next step, whereas zero emission buildings may follow in the near future. In these buildings the envelope constructions will have significant amounts of traditional thermal insulation, e. g. wall thicknesses up to about 400 mm are expected in passive houses. Such large thicknesses are not desirable due to several reasons, e. g. floor area considerations, efficient material use and need for new construction techniques. Vacuum insulation panels (VIPs) are regarded as one of the most promising existing highly thermal insulation solutions on the market today. Thermal performances 5 to 10 times better than traditional insulation materials (e. g. mineral wool) are achieved, resulting in substantial slimmer constructions. However, the robustness of building envelope systems applying VIPs are questioned. In addition, thermal bridging due to the panel envelope and load bearing elements may have a large effect on the overall thermal performance. Degradation of thermal performance of VIPs are also a crucial issue due to moisture and air diffusion through the panel envelope. In this work the thermal performance and robustness of vacuum insulation panels in wood <b>frame</b> <b>wall</b> constructions are studied by hot box measurements and numerical simulations.

40|$|The {{structural}} fire resistance of light timber <b>frame</b> <b>walls</b> and floors {{has traditionally been}} determined by using standard fire resistance tests to provide a Fire Resistance Rating (FRR). The required FRR was prescribed by building codes and had little relation to likely fire severity. More recently, simple formulae {{have been used to}} determine an appropriate FRR given the ventilation parameters of a compartment, the likely fuel load {{and to a lesser extent}} the thermal properties of the compartment boundaries. The work described in this thesis determines the validity of these formulae for light timber <b>frame</b> <b>walls</b> and floors and other materials. It is shown that, computer modelling can be used to determine the thermal and structural performance of light timber <b>frame</b> <b>walls</b> and floors exposed to fire. The COMPF- 2 program can be used with modification to model compartment fires. The thermal behaviour of cavity walls and floors exposed to fire can be modelled accurately using the T ASEF program. The structural behaviour of light timber <b>frame</b> <b>walls</b> and floors exposed to fire can be modelled using a general purpose finite element program, such as ABAQUS. The temperature dependent thermal properties used in the thermal model and the temperature dependent mechanical properties used in the structural model may not be absolutely accurate values, but are effective values that are (modifications of known values within a reasonable range) determined in the calibration process. A simple temperature based failure criterion has been devised for the structural response of light timber <b>frame</b> <b>walls</b> and floors exposed to fires. This study shows that simple time equivalent formulae are not suitable for the prediction of such a complex and variable phenomenon as the response of structures to fire. For accurate prediction of structural response under fire exposure, a more rigorous computer based analysis can be used to give much more reliable results than a simple time equivalent method...|$|R
