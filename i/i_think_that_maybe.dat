5000|$|Regarding {{the writing}} process for her lyrics, Holter noted, [...] "I {{basically}} just write stream of consciousness to a certain extent, I let the song kind of go where it wants to go.

[...] Both [...] "Sea Calls Me Home" [...] and [...] "Betsy on the Roof" [...] were written years prior to recording and often performed during Holter's live performances.

I personally think it lacked something. I mean {{it was a good}} sounding LP, but maybe it had a bit too much quality. I think it lacked a certain amount of soul, or maybe guts. It wasn't a particularly enjoyable event for me personally. That wasn't anybody's particular fault in the band, it was just the process of things. Maybe it took too long. Perhaps it should have been much easier. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> too many of the songs on Rogues Gallery sounded like pop hits, so the album began to lean too much to being regarded as a sort of 'poppy' album, and there is nothing worse than that for me." ...|$|E

During the development of this project, I have came working with two groups of students of the second year, at the Emiliano Ortega Espinoza School, the one experimental group and the second control group, six months ago, the 3 first months began to encourage to the students for working through by expositions, role- plays, games, debates and other activities, but during last three months May-July began to evaluate between two groups of the students, where the results let me prove that interactive Teaching in the classroom applying the four skills have a positive influence in the group experimental, who were using this interactive teaching program, at beginning was difficult for them, but then the interactive teaching classroom was very funny and amazing for them. Because They enjoyed with all the activities applied during the last 3 months. One becomes a teacher by loving the students and the subject by reading extensively in the field, as well as through trial and error, sweat and tears. All of us know that teaching is not easy task, in fact, we as teachers sometimes find it difficult to reach our students and make them understand what we are explaining or what we have explained. On the other hand, all of us have variety of experiences in our teaching life, these experiences are sometimes very good, but some are not so good, and make us feel as if we were not doing the things right. All of us know that there are different kinds of groups, and definitively, this makes our experiences not be the same all times. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> this is what makes teaching a challenging task. As we can see new trends have influenced too much for the language teaching to improve, and we as teachers need to know or at least have and idea on how those changes have been produced and the bases under which those changes have been done, besides that, it is good for us to know some hints of how experts think language must be taught. Finally, I feel proud that my research ended successfully, all my dear students collaborated of the best manner, Therefore authorities of this institution congratulated me for this work. and at the same time, it will help me into my professional life for taking in consideration all the knowledge acquired during the development of this research for the teaching/learning process of my students...|$|E

We get nothing but terrific feedback from fans on Twitter and Facebook. And not just in the UK, but in Australia and from other territories really keen to see it. We didnt do a red carpet, we just did a friends and family screening on the eve of its release. I even bought drinks at my own premiere!

40|$|This in {{an essay}} {{concerning}} the use of humor in male communication. Primarily, I have focused on studying how jokes {{can be used as}} a sanction for the training of members in a (male) group. I have found great inspiration in Goffman’s thoughts on a social face and the use of humor to protect this perceived face. Initially I started to reflect on men’s reluctance to discuss masculinity and their thoughts about the meaning of being a man. Every time I tried to hold a serious conversation, my male friends made a joke out of it. I seemed to meet a tirade of stereotypes and ironic statements. <b>I</b> started to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> men can’t talk about masculinity in groups because of a fear of losing face? Maybe it might be so, that the concept of being a “real man” is so diffuse and loose that men today don’t know what we expect of them? This uncertainty affects men’s social life; there is a need for common ground and security. In order to express an opinion about the act joking as well as the use of humor in male community, I first tried to familiarize myself with the prevailing notions of masculinity. I learned that the group is a powerful resource for promoting the use of stereotypes as well as the use of humor to create a sense of belonging or penalize those who do “wrong”. Jokes of all kind, friendly emphasis as well as more aggressive forms thrive in groups. I also noted that the type of humor is different in single-sex groups compared to humor in mixed gender groups. In addition to discussing the weight of group mentality I also write about body language, the importance of the ambiguity of humor and how humor can sanction in two ways: Laughter from the group: The target is sanctioned Laughter fails: The source gets sanctioned...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an analysis}} of J. S. Mill’s liberalism from a materialistic point of view. That means that I take his views on political economy and on “the social question” very seriously. I analyze all the areas of his thought, which are his ideas about socialism and democracy, women liberation, and imperialism in Ireland and India. In all the above I am {{making an effort to}} understand his views on philosophical anthropology, on philosophy of history and on political economy. In other words, I attempt to disclose the philosophical roots of his social theory and of his political ideas. I believe that Mill supports the application of a lenient kind of the capitalist mode of production, which he modifies towards a more democratic version. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he represents, <b>maybe</b> the most sophisticated kind of English radicalism in his time. Unfortunately for him, his effort cannot embrace, {{to the extent that he}} could, the working class’s claims about equality and liberty. In spite of the fact, that he calls himself socialist he doesn’t commit himself to the socialist path. He <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> the capitalist mode of production can be improved and he believes that some future version of this mode of production would be preferable to a socialistic one. He is afraid of class struggle and the only way to materialize his propositions is an ethical kind of talk. He believes that those who have the power will voluntarily consent to its relinquishment when they realise that this is the right thing to do. He is unable to propose the appropriate means for a feasible programme of a great social reform. His liberalism fails, because he didn’t understand the contradictions in it. Liberty collides with the notion of equality in his thought. The biggest contradiction in his thought is that on the one hand he supports individual autonomy, but on the other hand the philosophical roots of his social theory are ingrained in the social philosophy which is contained in the capitalist mode of production. ...|$|R
