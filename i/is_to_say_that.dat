5|$|A common {{neologism}} in the Python {{community is}} pythonic, which {{can have a}} wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.|$|E
5|$|The Clausius–Clapeyron {{relation}} {{leads to}} another equation also attributed to Kelvin, as the Kelvin equation. It explains why, because of surface tension, the vapor pressure for small droplets of liquid in suspension {{is greater than}} standard vapor pressure of that same liquid when the interface is flat. That <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> when a liquid is forming small droplets, the equilibrium concentration of its vapor in its surroundings is greater. This arises because the pressure inside the droplet is greater than outside.|$|E
5|$|With ample {{current density}} and ionization, this forms a {{luminous}} electric arc (a continuous electric discharge similar to lightning) between the electrodes. Electrical resistance along the continuous electric arc creates heat, which dissociates more gas molecules and ionizes the resulting atoms (where degree of ionization {{is determined by}} temperature), and as per the sequence: solid-liquid-gas-plasma, the gas is gradually turned into a thermal plasma. A thermal plasma is in thermal equilibrium, which <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the temperature is relatively homogeneous throughout the heavy particles (i.e. atoms, molecules and ions) and electrons. This is so because when thermal plasmas are generated, electrical energy is given to electrons, which, due to their great mobility and large numbers, are able to disperse it rapidly and by elastic collision (without energy loss) to the heavy particles.|$|E

60|$|<b>To</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Henrietta <b>was</b> {{volatile}} <b>is</b> but <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> she <b>was</b> woman. <b>To</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> she <b>was</b> in the bonnet-trimming <b>is</b> feebly <b>to</b> {{express the}} taste which reigned predominant in her own.|$|R
5|$|Aquinas {{supported}} Augustine's {{view that}} evil is a privation of goodness, maintaining that evil has existence as a privation intrinsically found in good. The {{existence of this}} evil, Aquinas believed, can be completely explained by free will. Faced with the assertion that humans {{would have been better}} off without free will, he argued that the possibility of sin is necessary for a perfect world, and so individuals are responsible for their sin. Good is the cause of evil, but only owing to fault on the part of the agent. In his theodicy, to say something is evil <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it lacks goodness which means that it could not be part of God's creation, because God's creation lacked nothing. Aquinas noted that, although goodness makes evil possible, it does not necessitate evil. This means that God (who is good) is not cast as the cause of evil, because evil arises out of a defect in an agent, and God is seen to be without defect. Philosopher Eleonore Stump, considering Aquinas' commentary on the Book of Job, argues that Aquinas has a positive view of suffering: it is necessary to contrast Earth with heaven and remind humans that they still have the propensity to commit evil. Aquinas believed that evil is acceptable because of the good that comes from it, and that evil can only be justified when it is required in order for good to occur. Attempting to relieve God of responsibility for the occurrence of evil, Aquinas insisted that God merely permits evil to happen, rather than willing it. He recognised the occurrence of what seems to be evil, but did not attribute to it the same level of existence that he attributed to spirituality. Like Augustine, Aquinas asserted that humans bear responsibility for evil owing to their abuse of free will.|$|E

If I <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I intended <b>to</b> listen seriously to Lord Wolfenden--even if I <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I intended <b>to</b> marry him--well, {{there is no one}} who would dare to interfere! But, on the other hand, I have refused him. That should be enough for you. I <b>am</b> not going <b>to</b> discuss the matter at all; you would not understand it." ...|$|R

25|$|Speakers of Utah English tend {{to utilize}} more mergers than {{speakers}} of Western American English; this <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> speakers of Utah English will pronounce certain phonemes, that are distinct in Western American English, the same way. Some examples include fail-fell, pool-pull, card-cord, pin-pen and heel-hill. Such mergers are used more by older speakers.|$|E
25|$|A {{complimentary}} {{definition of}} principal root (though not formally defined or universally accepted) <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{it is always}} the complex root that has the least value of the argument among all roots; here “argument” means the counterclockwise angle in radians between the positive real axis and the line joining the complex number to the origin.|$|E
25|$|If a {{group is}} funded by drugs, {{diamonds}} or other illicit trade {{then there is a}} substantial increase in the chance of renewed violence—100%-250%-- which <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> in such circumstances war is two to three-and-a-half times more likely to begin again. While Fortna finds that wars which involve many factions are less likely to resume, Doyle and Sambanis find the opposite.|$|E

25|$|In {{accordance}} with the first law for closed systems, energy transferred solely as heat leaves one body and enters another, changing the internal energies of each. Transfer, between bodies, of energy as work is a complementary way of changing internal energies. Though it is not logically rigorous {{from the viewpoint of}} strict physical concepts, a common form of words that expresses this <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> heat and work are interconvertible.|$|E
25|$|The {{share of}} treated {{wastewater}} in 2004 {{was estimated at}} 22%. This <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> more than three fourths of the wastewater generated did not receive any type of treatment prior to its final discharge, which poses {{a serious threat to}} the environment. Back in 1997, the coverage of wastewater treatment had only been 13%. In 2005, only two companies treated all of their sewage, one of them being from the Provincia de Marañón.|$|E
25|$|Fielding for a fast bowler {{is usually}} aggressive, that <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{it is set}} up for the purpose of getting a wicket rather than {{preventing}} the flow of runs. On occasion, particularly when the fielding team is batting last and is chasing a total, a defensive field is required. As a general rule it is difficult to bowl defensive fast bowling – that task is better suited to spin bowlers.|$|E
6000|$|Decoud {{seemed to}} find a fresh audacity in this voicing of his thoughts. [...] "You would not believe me if I <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> {{the love of the}} country which--" ...|$|R
5000|$|In one of {{his works}} within De institutione musica, Boethius <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> [...] "music <b>is</b> so {{naturally}} united with us that we cannot be free from it even if we so desired." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If," [...] said Mr. Quin, [...] "I <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{you did not}} see {{the great}} truths of science {{exhibited}} by that tree, though they stared any man of intellect in the face, what would you think or say? You would merely regard me as a pedant with some unimportant theory about vegetable cells. If I <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> you did not see in that tree the vile mismanagement of local politics, you would dismiss me as a Socialist crank with some particular fad about public parks. If I <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> you <b>were</b> guilty of the supreme blasphemy of looking at that tree and not seeing in it a new religion, a special revelation of God, you would simply say I was a mystic, and think no more about me. But if"--and he lifted a pontifical hand--"if I <b>say</b> <b>that</b> you cannot see the humour of that tree, and that I see the humour of it--my God! you will roll about at my feet." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{inferential}} view of TOTs {{claims that}} TOTs arise from {{clues about the}} target that the rememberer can piece together. This <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the rememberer infers {{their knowledge of the}} target word, and the imminence of retrieval depends upon the information that they are able to access about the target word from their memory. These views disregard the presence of the target word in memory as having an effect on creating tip of the tongue states.|$|E
25|$|As it {{is usually}} calculated, {{electronegativity}} is not a property of an atom alone, but rather a property of an atom in a molecule. Properties of a free atom include ionization energy and electron affinity. It {{is to be expected}} that the electronegativity of an element will vary with its chemical environment, but {{it is usually}} considered to be a transferable property, that <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> similar values will be valid in a variety of situations.|$|E
25|$|Criminal Law is {{the body}} of law that relates to crime. It proscribes conduct {{perceived}} as threatening, harmful, or otherwise endangering to the property, health, safety, and moral welfare of people. Most criminal law is established by statute, which <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the laws are enacted by a legislature. It includes the punishment of people who violate these laws. Criminal law varies according to jurisdiction, and differs from civil law, where emphasis is more on dispute resolution and victim compensation than on punishment.|$|E
5000|$|Green bumper {{stickers}} (like {{those used in}} his prior Congressional campaigns) circulated in the state saying [...] "Litton for President." [...] Jimmy Carter <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he thought Litton would be President one day.|$|R
5000|$|This was {{the only}} Civil War battle fought by future Secretary of War and U.S. Senator Stephen B. Elkins. Elkins <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he disgusted of war after what he {{witnessed}} in the battle: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Supposing," [...] she answered, {{still looking}} at him steadily, [...] "supposing I <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I had no object in coming here at all--that it was merely a whim? What should you say then?" ...|$|R
25|$|In {{times of}} water deprivation, urine {{electrolyte}} and osmotic concentration increases while urination rate decreases. Under these conditions urine solute:plasma ratio is approximately 2.5, or hyperosmotic; that <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{the ratio of}} solutes to water in the plasma is shifted down whereby reducing osmotic pressure in the plasma. Water is then able to be held back from excretion, keeping the ostrich hydrated, while the passed urine contains higher concentrations of solute. This mechanism exemplifies how renal function facilitates water retention during periods of dehydration stress.|$|E
25|$|The {{molecular}} {{structure of the}} alkanes directly affects their physical and chemical characteristics. It {{is derived from the}} electron configuration of carbon, which has four valence electrons. The carbon atoms in alkanes are always sp3 hybridized, that <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the valence electrons are said to be in four equivalent orbitals derived from the combination of the 2s orbital and the three 2p orbitals. These orbitals, which have identical energies, are arranged spatially {{in the form of a}} tetrahedron, the angle of cos−1(−)nbsp&≈nbsp&109.47° between them.|$|E
25|$|Stace {{argues that}} doctrinal {{differences}} between religious traditions are inappropriate criteria when making cross-cultural comparisons of mystical experiences. Stace argues that mysticism {{is part of}} the process of perception, not interpretation, that <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the unity of mystical experiences is perceived, and only afterwards interpreted according to the perceiver’s background. This may result in different accounts of the same phenomenon. While an atheist describes the unity as “freed from empirical filling”, a religious person might describe it as “God” or “the Divine”.|$|E

6000|$|... "Would it please you, Elcot, if I <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I'm {{very proud}} of that cut on your lip--though I'm horribly ashamed of being the cause of it? In any case, it's the simple truth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Suppose I <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I hated {{your being}} cross. I'm sure I do; {{and you are}} going away to-morrow, too. You have hardly said a nice word to me since you have been home." ...|$|R
