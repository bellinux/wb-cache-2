50|$|<b>Dip</b> <b>brazing</b> is {{especially}} suited for brazing aluminium because air is excluded, thus preventing {{the formation of}} oxides. The parts to be joined are fixtured and the brazing compound applied to the mating surfaces, typically in slurry form. Then the assemblies are dipped into a bath of molten salt (typically NaCl, KCl and other compounds), which functions as both heat transfer medium and flux.|$|E
40|$|A high {{efficiency}} forced air heat sink assembly employs a split feed transverse flow configuration {{to minimize the}} length of the air flow path through at least two separated fin structures. Different embodiments use different fin structure material configurations including honeycomb, corrugated and serpentine. Each such embodiment uses a thermally conductive plate having opposed exterior surfaces; one for receiving a component to be cooled and one for receiving the fin structures. The serpentine structured fin embodiment employs a plurality of fin supports extending from the plate and forming a plurality of channels for receiving the fin structures. A high thermal conductivity bondant, such as metal-filled epoxy, may be used to bond the fin structures to either the plate or the fin supports. <b>Dip</b> <b>brazing</b> and soldering may also be employed depending upon the materials selected...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was carried out}} to determine the mechanical behavior of sandwich panels containing cellular cores of varying shape. Compression and four point bend tests were performed on sandwich panels with square and triangular honeycomb cores. These honeycombs were made of perforated aluminum sheet of repeating diamond and hexagonal patterns. The sandwich panel assemblies were joined via <b>dip</b> <b>brazing.</b> Defects were introduced into some panels to quantify the effect on strength and stiffness. Hybrid sandwich panels, consisting of foam material in the void spaces of the square and triangular cells were evaluated for {{the effect on the}} defect tolerance of the structures. The results showed that sandwich panels with diamond shaped cores had compressive strengths approximately four times greater than hexagonal shaped cores. In four point bending the diamond cores were approximately twice as stiff as cores made from hexagonal patterned sheet. The introduction of defects lowered strength by about 30 % for diamond cores in compression, and about 15 % for hexagonal cores. In four point bending this strength reduction was not as significant due to shear stresses damaging periodicity at a faster rate than in compression. (cont.) The use of foam within the cells resulted in higher absolute peak compression and flexure loads, however the Load/Density ratios demonstrated cases where the added weight of the foam did not result in a better panel. A difference of nearly an order of magnitude between the highest and lowest compressive and flexure loads is evident when the presence of defects and foam are taken into account. by Brian P. Hohmann.

40|$|An Evaporator {{has been}} {{designed}} for NASA-Johnson Space Center Life Sciences to conduct experiments in Spacelab mission SLS- 1 using different samples such as blood, urine, human tissues etc. Two units will fly - one as a Refrigerator (4 C) and the other as a Freezer (- 22 C). The evaporator tube is <b>dip</b> <b>brazed</b> on a grooved flat plate. Aluminum heat sink is <b>dip</b> <b>brazed</b> {{on the other side}} of the plate. Freon R 5 O 2 is pumped through the tube and air is circulated over the finned surface to transfer heat. As freon 5 O 2 is considered toxic, the whole freon tube is covered with an evaporator cover to contain any freon leakage to avoid exposure to crew members. This containment is under vacuum and this pressure is monitored along with the freon pressure to determine freon leakage so that necessary steps can be taken to stop contamination of the spacelab air. An stress analysis has been done and it is found to have adequate safety margin to meet the requirements of NASA safety and reliability standards...|$|R
40|$|The NSC 800 is an 8 -bit CMOS {{microprocessor}} {{manufactured by}} National Semiconductor Corp., Santa Clara, California. The 8 -bit microprocessor chip with 40 -pad pin-terminals has eight address buffers (A 8 -A 15), eight data address [...] I/O buffers (AD(sub 0) -AD(sub 7)), six interrupt controls and sixteen timing controls with a chip clock generator and an 8 -bit dynamic RAM refresh circuit. The 22 internal registers {{have the capability}} of addressing 64 K bytes of memory and 256 I/O devices. The chip is fabricated on N-type (100) silicon using self-aligned polysilicon gates and local oxidation process technology. The chip interconnect consists of four levels: Aluminum, Polysi 2, Polysi 1, and P(+) and N(+) diffusions. The four levels, except for contact interface, are isolated by interlevel oxide.

40|$|In {{the frame}} of an ESA TRP project, our {{consortium}} has investigated the possibility to use advanced manufacturing methods for application to space hardware. After {{a review of the}} state of the art of the new manufacturing methods, including additive manufacturing but also advanced bonding, joining and shaping techniques, several case studies have been realized. These new techniques imply a different approach already at the design phase since the manufacturing constraints can be completely different. The goal of the project was to evaluate the different technologies from the design to the realization and learn how the classical design and development of such parts shall be adapted to take into account the different specificities of the new techniques. Three types of case studies have been developed successively. The first type was a re-manufacture of an existing piece of hardware using advanced techniques to evaluate if there is some potential improvement to be achieved (cost, production time, complexity reduction). The second level was to design and manufacture a part based on the application requirements. The last level was to design and manufacture a part taking into account in addition the subsystem to which it belongs. All case studies have been tested in terms of achieved performances and resistance to the mechanical and thermal environment. For each level, several case studies were proposed by ALMASpace and TAS-F and a pre-selection was performed to verify the feasibility and the interest of the proposed part for the project. For the first 2 levels, the 2 selected case studies have been designed, built and tested. A single case study was built for last level. The cases studies of level one were an aluminium inertial wheel housing (using electron beam welding to connect simple machined parts) and a mechanism housing fully made by additive manufacturing (electron beam melting of Titanium). The ones of level two were an aluminium tray for nanosatellite structure (assembled by salt <b>dip</b> <b>brazing)</b> and an antenna support bracket (designed by topological optimization and manufactured by laser beam melting of aluminium). The third level case study is a Sun Sensor for nanosatellite designed by topological optimization and including electronic circuit (optical detector and proximity electronic) deposited by aerosol jet printing directly on the aluminium structure. All case studies have been manufactured and tested and all part manufactured, despite including some imperfections, fulfilled all performance requirements. Peer reviewe...|$|E
