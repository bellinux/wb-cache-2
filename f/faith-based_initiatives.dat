25|$|There {{have been}} several notable {{challenges}} to prison corresponding services. The Missouri Department of Corrections (DOC) stated that effective June 1, 2007, inmates would be prohibited from using pen pal websites, citing concerns that inmates were using them to solicit money and defraud the public. Service providers such as WriteAPrisoner.com, together with the ACLU, plan to challenge the ban in Federal Court. Similar bans on an inmate's rights or a website's right to post such information has been ruled unconstitutional in other courts, citing First Amendment freedoms. Some <b>faith-based</b> <b>initiatives</b> promote {{the positive effects of}} correspondence on inmates, and some have made efforts to help ex-offenders reintegrate into society through job placement assistance. Inmates' ability to mail letters to other inmates has been limited by the courts. Inmate correspondence with members of society is typically encouraged because of the positive impact it can have on inmates, albeit under the guidelines of each institution and availability of letter writers.|$|E

There has been a tremendous amount of research on the impact of the faith-based organizations; however, very little attention has been given to the non-religious based social service organizations. To understand the impact of the faith-based implementation on non-religious based social service agencies, the primary focus was on examining: personnel, clientele, programs and services data, as well as internal and external factors. The secondary focus was determining if the implementation of the <b>faith-based</b> <b>initiative</b> signified the “second-order of devolution. ” The study focused on three NBSSOs in Washington, D.

While supporters argue that the <b>faith-based</b> <b>initiative</b> is about solving problems of poverty, taxing an over-burdened welfare system and violating the constitution, the researcher found that there was no impact of the <b>faith-based</b> <b>initiative</b> on non-religious based social service organizations. The participating agencies had been impacted by elected officials, public policy and federal funding, however; research also shows that there was no evidence of a “second-order of devolution. ” The expected outsourcing of public services and the creation of numerous models of welfare systems with a variety of public-private partnerships that included secular non-profit organizations, for-profit organizations and religious organizations had not occurred...|$|R

40|$|Enacted {{as part of}} the 1996 Welfare Reform bill, the <b>faith-based</b> <b>initiative</b> was {{intended}} to ensure that small religious groups were not discriminated against in the awarding of government funding. While there has {{been a great deal of}} attention paid to changes at the federal level, little attention has been paid to how and why states are implementing the <b>faith-based</b> <b>initiative.</b> Currently, states are not required to implement any part of the initiative, other than guaranteeing that faith-based organizations (FBOs) will not be discriminated against in funding decisions. Nevertheless, states have been acting on the initiative in a variety of ways in the hope of increasing the number of faith-based organizations performing social services. Although religious groups have been receiving government funds to provide social services for much of American history, the <b>faith-based</b> <b>initiative</b> represents a new effort from both state and federal governments to encourage even greater participation. To understand the state-level faith-based implementation I focus on two research questions: Why are states creating faith-based policies and practices? What are these new policies and practices? Data collected from multiple sources reveal three key aspects of faith-based policy implementation: appointment of state actors known as Faith-Based Liaisons (FBLs), legislation, and presentation of state Faith-Based Policy conferences. While supporters argue that the <b>faith-based</b> <b>initiative</b> is about solving problems of poverty and an over-burdened welfare system, I find that these policies and practices do not respond to problems of poverty or welfare, and do not offer the substantial new help to the poor and needy that was promised by supporters. Instead, I find that state faith-based practices are more likely to be implemented in states with a strong evangelical movement presence. My data also shows that these practices are actually a series of symbolic policies that further the goals of the evangelical movement in two ways. First, state faith-based policies and practices enable the evangelical movement's greater goal of chipping away at church/state separation. Second, because these policies and practices reframe and reshape the church/state relationship in ways that appeal to deeply held ideological views by many in the United States, they have the potential to create new political allies for the evangelical movement...|$|R

This initiative made over three billion dollars available to organizations that had heretofore been prohibited from accessing public funds due to their religious affiliation. As the initiative has developed, {{there seems to be}} a predominance of evangelical and fundamentalist Christian organizations involved in the projects that public funds support including services to those with mental illness. Evangelical and fundamental Christian ideology includes strong beliefs that people‟s problems are often the result of moral failure and the solution to many of life‟s problems lies in accepting Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. Viewing mental illness as moral failure has damaging implications for people with mental illness and for the public‟s understanding of mental illness. Additionally, the <b>faith-based</b> <b>initiative</b> is grounded in the principles of privatization, thus shifting services to those with mental illness into the private sector. As services are privatized, the fragile system of public mental health care in rural areas is often diminished or eliminated. Research shows that mental health professionals have a long history of practicing largely in urban areas, thus reducing the likelihood that private providers will serve rural areas.
