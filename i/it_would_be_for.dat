5|$|Christian Tuxen Falbe, a Danish marine officer, was in Paris in January 1839 {{on behalf}} of Crown Prince Frederik when Louis Daguerre {{revealed}} the art of daguerreotyping. Falbe informed the Crown Prince of a visit to Daguerre where he had {{seen some of the}} very earliest daguerreotypes, explaining how impressed he had been by the new process and how important he thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> art and science in Denmark. Shortly afterwards, he returned to Copenhagen with a camera and a couple of his own daguerreotypes for the Crown Prince who, believing them to be of scientific importance, deposited them with Hans Christian Ørsted, one of Denmark's most prominent scientists. As a result of Ørsted's own interest in photography, the new art took on rapidly: the daguerreotypist Mads Alstrup (1809–76) opened Copenhagen's first photographic studio in 1842; and by 1850 there were over a hundred studios in Copenhagen and many more in the provinces.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Grace and Jack are {{discussing}} their own problems. Grace uses Jack's promiscuous history with married men {{as a legitimate}} reason to have {{an affair with a}} married man, but Jack tells her to forget about it as both of them are the moral role models to their friends. After being honest with her, Jack confesses that the reason he is wearing an eye patch is not because he got glitter in his eye, as he told his friends. When he refused to stop his singing performance during the debut of his new talk show, Jack Talk, even though the entire set had accidentally been set on fire, his eyebrow was burnt off. Later, Will, Grace, and Jack all decide that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> the best to let Karen know the truth about Stan. Will breaks the news to her, but Karen believes he is joking. Rosario tells Karen that Stan is not dead, as she has been giving him reports on Karen. At the admission, Karen fires Rosario and leaves Will's apartment with Malcolm, explaining that Stan may be alive, but that he is still dead to her.|$|E

25|$|For positronium, {{the formula}} uses the reduced mass also, {{but in this}} case, it is exactly the {{electron}} mass divided by 2. For any value of the radius, the electron and the positron are each moving at half the speed around their common center of mass, and each has only one fourth the kinetic energy. The total kinetic energy is half what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> a single electron moving around a heavy nucleus.|$|E
25|$|On September 18, it was {{reported}} that left fielder Carl Crawford would miss the rest of the regular season due to a finger injury suffered in the previous month. Joe Maddon stated that the concern was over Crawford's inability to swing a bat, and that if he were to be used at all before being completely healed, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> defense and baserunning. Crawford said that if the Rays were to make the ALCS or the World Series, he would have a chance to come back.|$|E
25|$|Because {{tabulation}} hashing is {{a universal}} hashing scheme, {{it can be used}} in any hashing-based algorithm in which universality is sufficient. For instance, in hash chaining, the expected time per operation is proportional to the sum of collision probabilities, which is the same for any universal scheme as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> truly random hash functions, and is constant whenever the load factor of the hash table is constant. Therefore, tabulation hashing can be used to compute hash functions for hash chaining with a theoretical guarantee of constant expected time per operation.|$|E

25|$|Statistical {{hypothesis}} testing {{is a key}} technique of both frequentist inference and Bayesian inference, although {{the two types of}} inference have notable differences. Statistical hypothesis tests define a procedure that controls (fixes) the probability of incorrectly deciding that a default position (null hypothesis) is incorrect. The procedure is based on how likely <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> a set of observations to occur if the null hypothesis were true. Note that this probability of making an incorrect decision is not the probability that the null hypothesis is true, nor whether any specific alternative hypothesis is true. This contrasts with other possible techniques of decision theory in which the null and alternative hypothesis are treated on a more equal basis.|$|E
25|$|Important {{members of}} the {{scientific}} community were spared from Stalin's usual amount of wrath and their punishments were often lessened from what one usually would expect from the regime. In the beginning this was mainly because of ideological reasons to not harm the party by punishing someone who had received a major award or had international accreditation. Scientists were given more chances to explain their behavior or prove their innocents than average citizens because they were seen as valuable. Later, though <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> more practical reasons as scientists became the leaders in the arms race which played a major part in the Cold War. The Soviet Science Academy would become the dominant institute where these scientists were educated and often worked.|$|E

[...] Mitsui travelled in 1916 to Calgary to enlist with the 192nd Overseas Battalion.

500|$|In February 2009, The Hollywood Reporter {{announced}} that Samuel Bayer {{was hired to}} direct the film. According to New Line production chief Toby Emmerich, Michael Bay advocated heavily for Bayer's hiring, as Bay, Bayer, and director David Fincher came up as commercial directors together. It is Bay's opinion that Bayer had [...] "the ability to capture the kind of seductive and unsettling imagery that would make Nightmare feel like a fresh, visually arresting moviegoing experience". Bayer declined Platinum Dunes' offer; twice. It was not until Bay sent the director an email [...] "talking about the business", and explaining what kind of opportunity <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> Bayer that he finally agreed.|$|E
500|$|... "Death" [...] also touches {{upon the}} issue of euthanasia, and whether it is morally or {{ethically}} wrong to commit suicide. The episode's script indicates it is wrong for someone wishing to kill oneself to place the burden of that decision on a loved one: in this case, Grandpa Marvin demanding that Stan kill him, without considering how traumatizing an experience <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> Stan. This is most strongly illustrated {{at the end of}} the episode, in which the ghost of Marvin's grandfather (who had Marvin kill him long ago) tells Marvin he must not force Stan to commit such a traumatizing act. Although the ghost tells Grandpa Marvin he must die of [...] "natural causes", Marvin nevertheless continues seeking ways to kill himself, but without involving other people. Parker said this reflects his opinion that, [...] "Basically, it is OK to kill yourself, but you shouldn't ask someone else to do it and put someone else through the trip." ...|$|E

500|$|Lessing {{said she}} was {{inspired}} to write The Good Terrorist by the IRA bombing of the Harrods department store in London in 1983. She recalled, [...] "the media reported it to sound {{as if it was}} the work of amateurs. I started to think, what kind of amateurs could they be?" [...] and realised [...] "how easy <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> a kid, not really knowing what he or she was doing, to drift into a terrorist group." [...] Lessing already had Alice in mind as the central character: [...] "I know several people like Alice—this mixture of... maternal caring,... and who can contemplate killing large numbers of people without a moment's bother." [...] She described Alice as [...] "quietly comic" [...] because she is so full of contradictions. She {{said she was}} surprised how some of the characters (other than Jasper, Alice's love interest) developed, such as the pill-popping and fragile Faye, {{who turned out to be}} a [...] "destroyed person".|$|E

[...] According to a story in The Wall Street Journal she had {{previously}} thought that if she ever appeared in Sports Illustrated <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> soccer, since given her athletic background she had envisioned herself as a professional soccer player. [...] She also appeared in the body painting feature in the 2011 Swimsuit Issue where Joanne Gair painted her and Stewart Shining photographed her in New York City. 2013 was her third Swimsuit Issue. In both 2011 and 2013, Miller participated in the annual Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition of David Letterman's Top 10 on the Late Show with David Letterman on the night that the Swimsuit Issue cover model was announced.|$|E
500|$|After {{speaking}} with her friend, Swift became deeply fixated {{on the idea}} of how tragic <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> the person one loved to wed someone else. That night, Swift experienced a dream where one of her own ex-boyfriends married another girl. To her, this signaled that she had to compose a song about interrupting a wedding. In retrospect, she concluded, [...] "For me, I like {{to think of it as}} good versus evil. And this girl is just completely – just the evil one." [...] Swift entitled the album after [...] "Speak Now" [...] because it fit the album's concept, with each song being a different confession to a person. [...] "It's called Speak Now, and that pertains to the album as a concept and as an entire theme of the record more than I can even tell you," [...] she said. The song was released as a promotional single on October 5, 2010, as part of Countdown to Speak Now, an exclusive campaign launched by the iTunes Store. During the opening week of Speak Now, Swift performed [...] "Speak Now" [...] on the Late Show with David Letterman.|$|E

500|$|Originally, {{the band}} planned to release [...] "Don't Panic" [...] as Parachutes fourth single. However, it was {{abandoned}} after they deemed three singles were {{enough for an}} album. Following the successful single releases of the album in 2000, the band thought that Parachutes had gained enough exposure in significant regions in the United Kingdom. When they decided to release a fourth single, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> countries yet not [...] "overdosed" [...] by the hit singles [...] "Yellow" [...] and [...] "Trouble". Coldplay and their record label, Parlophone, settled on [...] "Don't Panic", {{which at the time}} was an audience favorite. The single was eventually released on 19 March 2001 in some European regions. The single is accompanied by the live tracks [...] "You Only Live Twice", a theme song for the James Bond film of the same name, and [...] "Bigger Stronger", a song taken from the band's first EP release; these live tracks were recorded during their performance at the Rockefeller Music Hall in Norway. [...] "Don't Panic" [...] appeared on the UK compilation album Now That's What I Call Music! 48.|$|E
500|$|Goldsmith was rumoured to be {{creating}} the theme tune for Enterprise, as although he didn't typically work on television, {{because of his}} affiliation with the Star Trek franchise, when he talked of creating a new television theme it was presumed that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> this series. The franchise was known for typically using orchestral themes, but Berman said that the theme tune would be more [...] "contemporary" [...] than heard in previous series and a [...] "little hipper". The theme was revealed to be a cover of the Rod Stewart single [...] "Faith of the Heart", by British tenor Russell Watson. Stewart's song had originally appeared on the soundtrack to the 1998 film Patch Adams. For the use in Enterprise, it was retitled to [...] "Where My Heart Will Take Me", but prompted a negative reaction from existing Star Trek fans. These included an online petition to have the song removed, {{and there was a}} protest held outside of Paramount Studios. Executive producers Braga and Berman both defended the choice, with Berman saying that the fan response was split over the song while Braga said that some people found the song [...] "uplifting". It was remixed for the third season, most notably with a new guitar track and fewer backing vocals.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2009–10 season, Queens Park Rangers had a £1 million {{rejected}} for Hooper. Coventry City were also rumoured to be interested in the striker. On 15 August, Hooper scored twice in a 3–2 win over Derby County. Scunthorpe manager Nigel Adkins said that he thought Hooper was a [...] "massive threat" [...] to the opposition and that he was worried that other teams would try to sign him {{before the end of the}} transfer window. On 22 February, captain Cliff Byrne, described Hooper as the kind of striker who could [...] "create something out of nothing". He also stated that he hoped Hooper would stay at the club but if he did leave <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> a lot of money. This was just after Hooper had scored in a 2–2 draw with Watford, taking his seasonal tally to 13. He scored a hat-trick against Bristol City on his return from a groin injury on 17 April 2010, and added a further two goals at Doncaster Rovers a week later. He scored 20 goals in 39 appearances in all competitions in the 2009–10 season, including 19 in 35 in the league, where he finished as third-top goal scorer behind Peter Whittingham and Nicky Maynard who both scored 20.|$|E
