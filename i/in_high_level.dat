5|$|The ceramic waste forms offer higher waste {{loadings}} {{than the}} glass options because ceramics have crystalline structure.

Due to this fact {{and the fact that}} they can be processed at lower temperatures, ceramics are often considered the next generation <b>in</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> radioactive waste forms. Ceramic waste forms offer great potential, but a lot of research remains to be done.|$|E

25|$|Individual {{routines}} in trampolining {{involve a}} build-up phase {{during which the}} gymnast jumps repeatedly to achieve height, followed by a sequence of ten bounces without pause during which the gymnast performs a sequence of aerial skills. Routines are marked out of a maximum score of 10 points. Additional points (with no maximum {{at the highest levels}} of competition) can be earned depending on the difficulty of the moves and the length of time taken to complete the ten skills which is an indication of the average height of the jumps. <b>In</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> competitions, there are two preliminary routines, one which has only two moves scored for difficulty and one where the athlete is free to perform any routine. This is followed by a final routine which is optional. Some competitions restart the score from zero for the finals, other add the final score to the preliminary results.|$|E

25|$|Since Descartes's {{proposal}} of dualism, {{it became a}} general consensus that the mind had {{become a matter of}} philosophy and that science was not able to penetrate the issue of consciousness- that consciousness was outside of space and time. However, over the last 20 years, many scholars have begun to move toward a science of consciousness. Antonio Damasio and Gerald Edelman are two neuroscientists that have led the move to neural correlates of the self and of consciousness. Damasio has demonstrated that emotions and their biological foundation play a critical role <b>in</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> cognition, and Edelman has created a framework for analyzing consciousness through a scientific outlook. The current problem consciousness researchers face involves explaining how and why consciousness arises from neural computation. In his research on this problem, Edelman has developed a theory of consciousness, in which he has coined the terms primary consciousness and secondary consciousness.|$|E
500|$|During the match, to the {{surprise}} of the public, the press and his teammates, Ponsford announced his retirement from first-class cricket at the relatively young age of 34. His announcement remarked upon the changing atmosphere <b>in</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> cricket and touched on the effects of Bodyline. [...] Woodfull remarked that Ponsford's retirement was premature, while teammate and journalist Jack Fingleton believed that the task of maintaining such high standards had affected Ponsford's nervous energy: [...] "At the age of 34 he felt that he never wanted to see a bat or a cricket game again." [...] Arthur Mailey suspected that Ponsford's sensitivity to criticism, especially from the media, was a key factor behind the early retirement. The memory of being omitted from the Australian side twice during the Bodyline series also stung Ponsford sorely. Ponsford continued playing for the Melbourne Cricket Club until 1939, but never represented his state or country again.|$|E
