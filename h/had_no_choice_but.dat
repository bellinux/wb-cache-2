5|$|Lancaster {{negotiated}} a truce with Harclay, and withdrew to the town. During the night {{a great number}} of the rebels deserted, and the next day the sheriff of York arrived from the south with additional forces. Lancaster, now greatly outnumbered and with no chance of retreat, <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to surrender to Harclay.|$|E
5|$|It {{was about}} this time that an {{incident}} occurred that temporarily clouded his career. In a moment of anger he struck one of the Thalias lieutenants, Robert Forbes. He was brought to court-martial on 12 June 1798 aboard , and the offence being proved, the court <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to dismiss him from the service. In view of the mitigating circumstances, the court recommended that Paulet be considered for clemency by King George III. The King was pleased to follow the recommendation and reinstated Paulet in the service.|$|E
5|$|On 7 September 2007, {{following}} the security breach {{on the previous}} day, Taylor, Reucassel, Dominic Knight and their film crew were detained and questioned over a follow-up stunt. This incident involved running near and attempting to enter the APEC protected zone dressed in cardboard cars mounted with Canadian flags, {{a reference to the}} flags' earlier use to disguise the successful breach by the real motorcade. Police <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to release all members involved in this stunt, as they were outside the prohibited area. This stunt also aired on the 12 September episode.|$|E

5|$|On November 11, 1793, Charles IV {{dissolved}} the society. Soon {{the newspaper}} disappeared as well. Espejo <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> {{to work as}} a librarian in the National Library. Because of his liberal ideas, he was imprisoned on January 30, 1795, being allowed to leave his cell only to treat his patients as a doctor and, on December 23, to die at his home from the dysentery he acquired during his imprisonment. Eugenio Espejo died on December 28. His death certificate was registered in the book for Indians, mestizos, blacks and mulattoes.|$|E
5|$|Richard now <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> {{to comply}} with the appellants' demands; Brembre and Tresilian were {{condemned}} and executed, while de Vere and de la Polewho had by now also left the countrywere sentenced to death in absentia at the Merciless Parliament in February 1388. The proceedings went further, and a number of Richard's chamber knights were also executed, among these Burley. The appellants had now succeeded completely in breaking up the circle of favourites around the king.|$|E
5|$|Their {{cattle and}} oxen were now {{exhausted}} and lean, but the Donner Party crossed the next stretch of desert relatively unscathed, and the journey {{seemed to get}} easier, particularly through the valley next to the Ruby Mountains. Despite their near hatred of Hastings, they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to follow his tracks, which were weeks old. On September 26, two months after embarking on the cutoff, the Donner Party rejoined the traditional trail along a stream that {{became known as the}} Humboldt River. The shortcut had probably delayed them by a month.|$|E

5|$|Umar, {{apparently}} {{wanting to}} defeat the Byzantines first, employed the best Muslim troops against them. The continuing stream of Muslim reinforcements worried the Byzantines, who fearing that the Muslims with such reinforcements would grow powerful, decided that they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to attack. The reinforcements that {{were sent to the}} Muslims at Yarmouk arrived in small bands, giving the impression of a continuous stream of reinforcements, in order to demoralize the Byzantines and compel them to attack. The same tactic would be repeated again during the Battle of Qadisiyah.|$|E
5|$|When Lancaster {{arrived at}} the town of Boroughbridge, Harclay was already in {{possession}} of the bridge crossing the river. The rebel forces counted probably no more than 700 knights and men-at-arms, against the 4,000 or so soldiers in the royal army. Lancaster initially tried to negotiate, but Harclay could not be swayed. Since there was no realistic alternative place to cross the river, and with the royal forces in pursuit from the south, the rebels <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to fight. The ensuing battle was short and one-sided.|$|E
5|$|A {{railroad}} {{was being}} built {{and the population}} of Quorn hoped that it would go through the village {{on its way to}} Sioux City, Iowa. However, the railroad did not go through Quorn. One of the many ideas about why the railroad took a different route was due to a disagreement between the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company and the Close brothers. The actual reason is still unknown. Due to the railroad being the main mode of transportation of goods, the villagers <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to relocate to a new area. Every business except for a mill was moved to a new area during 1883.|$|E

5|$|After {{crossing}} the Mississippi River south of Vicksburg at Bruinsburg and driving northeast, Grant won battles at Port Gibson and Raymond and captured Jackson, the Mississippi state capital, on May 14, 1863, forcing Pemberton to withdraw westward. Attempts {{to stop the}} Union advance at Champion Hill and Big Black River Bridge were unsuccessful. Pemberton knew that the corps under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman was preparing to flank him from the north; he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to withdraw or be outflanked. Pemberton burned the bridges over the Big Black River and took everything edible in his path, both animal and plant, as he retreated to the well-fortified city of Vicksburg.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{painting}} Bảo Đại as {{a sexually}} insatiable glutton, Diệm's campaign also attacked {{the head of}} state's nationalist credentials. They criticised him as being too soft in his dealings with French colonial authorities, and for serving {{as the head of}} state of the Empire of Vietnam, a puppet regime set up by Imperial Japan after they invaded during World War II. They also accused him of ceding half the country to the communists. The communists had already captured more than half the country on the battlefield, and Diệm claimed he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice,</b> <b>but</b> Diệm's campaign portrayed him as incompetent and unwilling to take the blame.|$|E
5|$|By 1980, the {{authorities}} <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> {{to make another}} attempt to raise consumer prices to realistic levels, but they knew that doing so would likely spark another worker rebellion. Western bankers providing loans to the Polish government at {{a meeting at the}} Bank Handlowy in Warsaw on 1 July 1980 made it clear that low prices of consumer goods could no longer be subsidized by the state. The government gave in and on 1 July announced a system of gradual but continuous price rises, particularly for meat. A wave of strikes and factory occupations began at once, with the biggest ones taking place in Lublin in July 1980.|$|E

5|$|In March 1383, Carrouges made a third {{effort to}} expand his family holdings, with the {{purchase}} of the neighbouring fiefs of Cuigny and Plainville from his neighbour Sir Jean de Vauloger. The sale required approval from Count Pierre, who was overlord of both fiefs, but as consequence of the previous legal difficulties Carrouges had caused him, Pierre refused to permit the sale and insisted that Carrouges turn the properties over to him in exchange for a full refund of the original price paid. Carrouges <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to comply and subsequently blamed Jacques Le Gris' influence for this new misfortune.|$|E
5|$|In November 1276, war was declared. Initial {{operations}} were launched under the captaincy of Mortimer, Lancaster (Edward's brother Edmund) and William de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick. Support for Llywelyn was weak among his own countrymen. In July 1277 Edward invaded {{with a force}} of 15,500, of whom 9,000 were Welshmen. The campaign never came to a major battle, and Llywelyn soon realised he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to surrender. By the Treaty of Aberconwy in November 1277, he was left only with the land of Gwynedd, though {{he was allowed to}} retain the title of Prince of Wales.|$|E
5|$|Many former {{adherents of}} the Fasci left Sicily. Life had grown hard and {{employment}} {{difficult to find}} because of their involvement with the movement. For those in Sicily who wanted to change their life for the better in those days, {{there were only two}} alternatives: rebel or emigrate. After the failure of the rebellion many peasants <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to vote with their feet and opted for emigration. Others remained, and a year later, in 1895, protests against unjust taxes and about the issue of communal land resumed in many towns in Sicily. The disbandment of troop had to be postponed.|$|E
