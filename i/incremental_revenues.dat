With Purisima leading Aquino's economic management team, the Philippine economy has kept a 6-year running growth average of 6.2%, its fastest run in 40 years. Under the Aquino administration, the Philippines has also been enjoying strengthening investor and consumer confidence, upgraded to a notch above investment grade by Standard & Poor's and to investment grade by Moody's, Fitch, the National Information and Credit Evaluation (NICE) Investors Service, and the Japan Credit Rating Agency. With 24 positive credit rating actions since 2010, the Philippines is so far the world's most upgraded sovereign. Increased confidence on the Philippines’ prospects has led to a sixfold jump in foreign direct investments (FDIs), from $1.07 billion in 2010 to $6.20 billion in 2014.Under Purisima's watch, the Philippines' debt as a percentage to GDP fell to a historic low of 44.8% as of 2015, a 10 percentage point decline from the 54.8% posted in 2009 before the Aquino administration took over with a governance philosophy espousing fiscal responsibility. Purisima was also a key champion of the Sin Tax Reform Law passed in 2013, which as of October 2015 has already raised an additional P149.5 billion in <b>incremental</b> <b>revenues</b> from excise taxes on the consumption of tobacco and alcohol products, which are then poured into the Aquino administration's universal health care program. As of 2015, the national Philippine government's deficit was contained to a healthy 0.9% of GDP, while tax effort as a percentage of GDP rose from 12.1% in 2010 to 13.7%, achieved through revenue administration reforms and tougher enforcement.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} revenue {{performance}} of choice-based revenue management (RM) systems in various business environments. Previous research conducted using simulated data suggests that <b>incremental</b> <b>revenue</b> gains {{of up to}} 15 % {{are to be expected}} when choice-based RM techniques are employed. In addition, despite the novelty of these techniques, the implementation of choice-based RM systems is considered to be feasible at large global corporations. The revenue potential and the ease of execution associated with the choice-based methods are examined {{in the context of a}} large hotel chain. Customer-centric data which includes transaction and time of booking availability information is collected for five hotel properties located in the continental US. The customer preference for hotel products and their attributes is determined using discrete choice and other ad hoc models of demand. Optimization techniques that account for the customer purchasing behavior are employed to compute the capacity control policies the hotel operator should follow to maximize its revenues. Results indicate that collecting customer-centric data from today s RM systems is a time-consuming task. In the environment in which the study hotels operate, the choice-based RM systems report <b>incremental</b> <b>revenue</b> gains that are dependent on how the purchasing behavior models are formulated. In capacity constrained regimes that are the focus of RM, revenue gains of up to 2 % are typically noted. In controlled environments in which the customer purchasing behavior can be better asserted, the <b>incremental</b> <b>revenue</b> gains range between 1 % and 14 %. These findings suggest that the execution of the choice-based RM, while feasible, needs to be preceded by the implementation of efficient and, most likely, expensive data collection procedures. The <b>incremental</b> <b>revenue</b> gains, consistent with those reported in the literature, indicate that RM users can substantially benefit from the use of the choice-based RM. Ph. D.

40|$|Companies in {{a variety}} of {{industries}} (e. g., airlines, hotels, theaters) often use last-minute sales to dispose of unsold capacity. Although this may generate <b>incremental</b> <b>revenues</b> in a short term, the long-term consequences of such a strategy are not immediately obvious: more discounted last-minute tickets may lead to more consumers anticipating the discount and delaying the purchase rather than buying at the regular (higher) prices, and hence potentially reducing revenues for the company. To mitigate such behavior, many service providers have turned to opaque intermediaries such as hotwire. com that hide many descriptive attributes of the service (e. g., departure times for airline tickets) so that the buyer cannot fully predict the ultimate service provider. Using a stylized economic model, this paper attempts to explain and compare the benefits of last-minute sales directly to consumers vs. through an opaque intermediary. We utilize the notion of rational expectations to model consumer purchasing decisions: con-sumers make early purchase decisions based on expectations regarding future availability, and these expectations are correct in equilibrium. We show that direct last-minute sales are preferred over selling through an opaque intermediary when consumer valuations for travel are high and/o...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{extends the}} traditional, static cost and revenue model {{developed}} in manufacturing settings by studying four factors that moderate the cost-revenue relationship: real options, returns-to-scale, structural changes, {{and levels of}} aggregation. We use the motion picture industry as a research setting since it provides an interesting context {{for this type of}} research. For instance each product in the industry, a motion picture, is an experiential good with tractable costs and revenues. The critical costs to developing and marketing a successful motion picture are production and advertising costs. Using a sample of 1, 695 motion pictures released between 1990 and 2003, we find that advertising costs – a result of the managerial exercise of real options – have a stronger association with revenues than do production costs – a first-stage investment. We also find that movies with larger costs have higher <b>incremental</b> <b>revenues</b> per cost, consistent with returns-to-scale. In addition, we discover that structural changes in the industry greatly affect the cost-revenue relationship during our observation period. Finally, we find that the cost-revenue relationship is stronger at a higher level of aggregation than at a lower level. In conclusion, our results indicate that the simple linear static model of cost-revenue relationship is limited. I...|$|E

40|$|Post-combustion Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) {{promises}} to substantially reduce CO 2 emissions from conventional coal-fired power plants. The key barrier to commercialization is its high operational cost {{due to a}} significant energy penalty. Dispatchable CCS {{has the potential to}} reduce the revenue loss by taking advantage of the volatility of energy prices. In addition, dispatchable CCS can serve as a cost effective way to integrate intermittent electricity generation from renewable sources. This project investigates the economic feasibility of retrofitting Powerton Power Plant in Illinois with dispatchable CCS (both in two-mode and three-mode arrangements) and integrating it with one local wind farm. A simulation model is used to estimate the incremental costs and <b>incremental</b> <b>revenues</b> associated with a dispatchable CCS system and wind integration in comparison to conventional continuously-operated CCS system. According to the simulation results, flexible operation of CCS integrated with wind power effectively mitigates the profit loss due to the CCS energy penalty. A two-mode arrangement dispatchable CCS integrated with this wind farm generates approximately 2. 5 billion dollars in a period 30 years while the total profit from a three-mode arrangement system varies from 1 to 2. 4 billion dollars. Comparing incremental costs and revenues, it can be concluded that the two-mode arrangement is more suitable for Powerton power plant because it generates positive profit even without the wind farm. More research needs to be conducted before we extend this conclusion to other utilities, however, flexible operation of CCS and synergy with wind power promise to lower the carbon price needed to make CCS economic...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to study}} the {{consequences}} of listing national brands in discounters. Is the discount channel a promising outlet for manufacturer brands? Is it an effective means to attract new buyers? Which combination of brand and discount destination at which price is best suited for this strategic move? Design/methodology/approach – Based on a unique dataset (tracking grocery purchase behavior for {{a representative sample of}} German households) and employing both descriptive and multivariate statistical techniques, the authors examine the outcome for 134 national brands introduced in six discount chains in Germany between January 2003 and July 2004. Findings – Both the manufacturer and discounter are able to grow their total performance in excess of the market following the introduction {{for the majority of the}} brands. Hence, potential cannibalization is more than offset by <b>incremental</b> <b>revenues.</b> It is found that, on average, close to 80 per cent of national brands' sales at a discounter is from new brand buyers. Discounters typically benefit less, as only 29 percent of brand sales are from new category buyers at their store. Practical implications – Including manufacturer brands into a discount assortment will benefit both the manufacturers and the discounters. Examination of the substantial cross‐brand differences reveals that manufacturers and discounters attract more new customers with brands for which market penetration is still modest. Also, discounters gain more from adding branded offerings in underperforming categories, and benefit from brands that enjoy higher customer loyalty. Finally, national‐brand prices should be set carefully at discounters. It is advised to maintain their price premium even at a discounter. Originality/value – Discounters are the fastest growing grocery format in Europe. Lately, many discounters add national brands to their private‐label dominated assortment, a move widely discussed in media with substantial implications for grocery channel management. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of that trend...|$|E
