5|$|Engine {{packaging}} {{became a}} contentious issue during development. Holden's designers wanted the engine positioned well {{behind the front}} axle to allow short overhangs and an overall sportier appearance, whereas the crash engineers were concerned that this would reduce the body's impact absorption in an accident. Negotiation between designers and crash engineers resulted in moving some of the engine components, including relocating the battery to the boot, freeing up valuable front-end space. By having the engine moved back and further down, the VE Commodore also benefits from near perfect 50:50 weight distribution across all variants, leading to superior handling. Crash engineers introduced several other safety initiatives, including relocating the fuel tank {{in front of the}} rear-axle line, instead of behind. A more crash-resistant rear-end was also seen as necessary. The design though had to incorporate a spacious boot and a spare-wheel bay that could house the largest-sized wheel to be fitted to the car. Crash test results from Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) rate the VE lower in the offset <b>frontal</b> <b>impact</b> test than the previous generation Commodore. The overall crash score was marginally higher than the outgoing VZ, due to improvements in side impact protection giving a score of 27.45 out of 37 or a four star rating out of a possible five.|$|E

For the RB25DET engine the ignition system was also changed, with the ignition module no longer located on the cam covers and was instead replaced by smart ignition coils (Ignitor built into coil) and ECU. The RB25DET's turbo was also given a nylon compressor wheel to improve response. Throughout the time the R33 was produced there were quite a number of different styled lights and bodykits fitted, the actual body/chassis underwent no changes. Among the cosmetic changes in the spec 2 were, the headlights which tapered down more towards the grill and were fitted with improved reflectors, the grill (which was longer on the Spec 1), the bonnet which had a re-shaped leading edge to fit the new lights and front bumper changing shape in the smallest amount to match the lower edge of the new headlights.

40|$|Whiplash {{associated}} disorders, {{also called}} whiplash injuries or AIS 1 neck injuries, represent {{one of the}} most significant types of injury in car crashes regarding both frequency and long-term consequences. The injury mechanisms are not fully understood, thus making it difficult to design and evaluate protection systems in cars. The highest risk is found in rear-end impacts, but the largest number of incidents is found in <b>frontal</b> <b>impacts.</b> This thesis focuses on occupants in frontal as well as rear-end impacts and presents an approach leading to development of AIS 1 neck injury protection systems. Several parameters influencing risk of AIS 1 neck injuries in <b>frontal</b> and rear-end <b>impacts</b> are identified by analysing accident data. Subsets of Volvo's accident database are used for the analyses. Additional information was collected for two of the studies regarding details in sitting posture and neck symptoms including duration, and in one study crash pulse information from on-board crash recorders is analysed. Field impact scenarios, with different AIS 1 neck injury risk, are simulated using computer models and sled tests to get additional data on the loading conditions in the human body and to enable the identification of responses correlating to relative injury risk. Biomechanical guidelines have been derived, and evaluation criteria are suggested for rear-end impacts. A whiplash mitigation seat, WHIPS (WHIplash Prevention System), was developed for rear-end impacts, based on this study. The AIS 1 neck injury reducing effect of WHIPS is evaluated, demonstrating not only the significant efficiency of the seat but also the feasibility of the approach chosen. For frontal as well as rear-end impacts, women are found to have a higher AIS 1 neck injury risk. In rear-end impacts, increased occupant stature is related to increased injury risk, while in <b>frontal</b> <b>impacts,</b> decreased occupant weight is related to increased injury risk. Prior neck problems is found to be a risk factor irrespective of impact direction. Sitting posture, however, is influential with respect to different parameters in <b>frontal</b> and rear-end <b>impacts.</b> In <b>frontal</b> <b>impacts,</b> change of velocity and deceleration based measures are identified as possible impact severity measures using crash recorder data. In rear-end impacts, the biomechanical guidelines are to reduce occupant acceleration, reduce relative spine movements and reduce occupant rebound. In order to reflect the biomechanical guidelines in sled tests, evaluation criteria are suggested. Concerning <b>frontal</b> <b>impacts,</b> initial relative neck movements are suggested to be kept as small as possible in this first step. The significance of this thesis is twofold. Firstly, identification of various influential parameters and visualisation of possible injury causing kinematics, adding knowledge to the puzzle of understanding AIS 1 neck injuries in <b>frontal</b> and rear-end <b>impacts.</b> Secondly, development and evaluation of a feasible and robust low-risk approach, implementing a safe direction in the development of protection systems for an injury type where the knowledge of injury mechanisms is limited...|$|R

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The {{protection}} of children in cars is improving with {{the increasing use of}} better designed restraint systems.

The CREST project, funded by the European Commission, was initiated to develop the knowledge on the kinematics behaviour and tolerances of children involved in car crashes. The final aim of the project is to propose enhanced test procedures for evaluating the effectiveness of child restraint systems (CRS).

There is no data, however, on the effect of occupant position on the muscle response to <b>frontal</b> <b>impacts.</b> Therefore, the objective of the study was to measure cervical muscle response to graded right anterolateral impacts. Methods Twenty volunteers were subjected to right anterolateral impacts of 4. 3, 7. 8, 10. 6, and 12. 8 m/s 2 acceleration with their trunk flexed forward 45 degrees and laterally flexed right or left by 45 degrees. Bilateral EMG of the sternocleidomastoids, trapezii, and splenii capitis and acceleration of the sled, torso, and head were measured. Results and discussion With either direction of trunk flexion at impact, the trapezius EMGs increased with increasing acceleration (p Conclusion When the subject sits with trunk flexed out of neutral posture at the time of anterolateral impact, the cervical muscle response is dramatically reduced compared to <b>frontal</b> <b>impacts</b> with the trunk in neutral posture.

40|$|Objective: The true {{incidence}} and survivability of blunt traumatic aortic rupture following road traffic accidents in the UK is unclear. The {{objective of this}} study was to determine the extent of blunt traumatic aortic rupture in the UK after road traffic accidents and the conditions under which it occurs. Methods: Data for the study was obtained from the Co-operative Crash Injury Study database. Road traffic accidents that happened between 1992 and 1999 and included in the Co-operative Crash Injury Study database were retrospectively investigated. Results: A total of 8285 vehicles carrying 14 435 occupants were involved in 7067 accidents. There were 132 cases of blunt traumatic aortic rupture, of which the scene survival was 9 % and the overall mortality was 98 %. Twenty-one percent of all fatalities had blunt traumatic aortic rupture (130 / 613). Twenty-nine percent were due to <b>frontal</b> <b>impacts</b> and 44 % were due to side impacts. Twelve percent of the blunt traumatic aortic rupture cases in <b>frontal</b> vehicle <b>impacts</b> were wearing seat belts and had airbag protection and 19 % had no restraint mechanism. The Equivalent Test Speed of the accident vehicles, (where equivalent test speed provides an estimate of the vehicle impact severity and not an estimate of the vehicle speed at the time of the accident), ranged from 30 to 110 km/h in <b>frontal</b> <b>impacts</b> and from 15 to 82 km/h in side impacts. Conclusion: Blunt traumatic aortic rupture carries a high mortality and occurred in 21 % of car occupant deaths in this sample of road traffic accidents.
