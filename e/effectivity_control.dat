In order to satisfactorily analyze the <b>effectivity</b> of <b>control</b> programs at the population level, insight is needed at the flock level, i. e., how the grouping of sheep in flocks affects the population-level transmission risk. In particular, one would like to understand how this risk is affected by between-flock differences in genotype frequency distribution. A first step is to model the scrapie transmission risk within a flock {{as a function of the}} flock genotype profile. Here we do so by estimating parameters for a model of within-flock transmission using genotyping data on Dutch flocks affected by scrapie. We show that the data are consistent with a relatively simple transmission model assuming horizontal transmission and homogeneous mixing between animals. The model expresses the basic reproduction number for within-flock scrapie as a weighted average of genotype-specific susceptibilities, multiplied by a single overall transmission parameter. The value of the overall transmission parameter may vary between flocks to account for random between-flock variation in non-genetic determinants such as management practice. Here we provide an estimate of its mean value and variation for Dutch flocks...|$|R

CXL treatment is supported by evidence of <b>effectivity</b> in the <b>control</b> of infectious keratitis stopping the progress of corneal melting, but the absence of control groups in the studies published to date does {{not allow us to}} indicate this treatment as immediately feasible. The treatment seems to be more effective in blocking corneal melting in bacteria and Acanthamoeba than in fungus, but the different grades of severity of keratitis and the absence of standardization to evaluate this do not allow us to provide a clear final suggestion. Furthermore, a recent article [46] showed a contradictory outcome in the application of CXL in rabbits infected with Acanthamoeba keratitis, stating that this treatment was not effective. On the other hand, another author [47] proposed a combined treatment with amphotericin B and CXL in fungal infection. In this way, the drug interacts with the fungal membrane sterols forming transmembrane channels and allows the riboflavin to enter into the cell and then destroy its activity. We have to bear in mind also that CXL with UV-A and riboflavin reduces corneal permeability [48] and how this issue can affect postoperative treatment. The expected complications of CXL in infectious keratitis are endothelial cell loss related to fungal deep infiltration and reactivation of previous herpes simplex. With the intention of avoiding these complications, we propose the following: first, to exclude all patients with a previous history of herpes keratitis, second, to use hyposmolarity riboflavin when a deep infiltration is observed. At present, CXL should be considered in cases of severe unresponsive infectious keratitis before undertaking emergency keratoplasty. A study to compare CXL with standard topical antibiotic treatment in which the severity of keratitis and the infecting organism are homogeneous is required to clarify and prove its application.|$|R

The {{reason for this}} is both medical as well as sociopolitical. The purpose of this dissertation is to examine the inter-action of various differential variables which influence the control of TB in this country. TB whilst caused by a germ, is adversely affected by socioeconomic deprivation, which in turn has distinct political connotations in South Africa. The dissertation therefore examines the inter-play of the historical and present influences of sociopolitical factors on the TB situation at present. Another important aspect of TB control is the State's efforts to control TB through the TB Control Programme (TBCP). This dissertation discusses the objectives of the TBCP and meaSures its effectivity against the socio-political context in which it functions. This is followed by a series of suggestions including an examination of the financial implications of these. A non-governmental organisation (NGO), SANTA (The South African National TB Association) is a further actor in the control of TB. As specified delegates of the State for TB health education, it is essential that their role be examined both in terms of the TBCP as well as in terms of their own stated objectives for TB control.

For instance, in drug delivery area, such release system offers numerous advantages compared to conventional dosage drug forms including improved efficiency, reduced toxicity and controlled release profile. Current challenges in this area include biocompatiblity and biodegrability of the materials used in the system, controllablity and <b>effectivity</b> of the <b>control</b> mechanism, easiness of device fabraiction and drug loading loss as well as total cost. In this work, a simple and effective method is adopted to design and fabricate controlled release devices employing smart conmtrol mechanism. Such a technology could be further applied in pharmaceutics, biomeidical science and biotechnologies. Controlled molecule release devices in this work employ the advantage of core-shell structures. In the first design, core-shell microcapsules are developed capable of regulating the release profile of encapsulated molecules. These microcapsules uniquely contain embedded miniature actuators inside their liquid core. The internal actuators are made of stimuli-responsive smart hydrogel beads. The embedded hydrogel beads swell in response to external electric fields, regulating the internal pressure of the liquid core, and thus the diffusion rate, of the encapsulated molecules from the microcapsules. The incorporation of the actuators into the interior of the microcapsules provides an internal control variable to a conventional diffusion-based release process. The microcapsules, which behave much like micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), are fabricated by a simple co-electrospray process. This fabrication technique allows integrating the hydrogel beads, forming the polymer shell, and loading the releasable molecules simultaneously in one step. The other controlled release device is developed by embedding nanofluidic biomolecule reservoirs into a polymer network of a stimuli-responsive hydrogel. The reservoirs are made of liquid core-polymer shell nanofibers using co-electrospinning technique. The mechanism of controlled release is based on buckling instability of the polymer shell under combined axial and radial compression, caused by volume changes of hydrogel responding to a specific external stimulus. The device decouples releasable biomolecules from a hydrogel polymer matrix, avoiding chemical interactions between biomolecules and hydrogel polymer chains, and thus, alleviating nontrivial chemical and biological engineering design of hydrogel formulations.

With this knowledge, existing nanoparticles can be evaluated, improved and more effective nanoparticles can be designed. The goal of this work was to study the internalization efficiency, successful drug loading, pore sealing and controlled drug release from colloidal mesoporous silica (CMS) nanoparticles. The entire work was performed in close collaboration with the group of Prof. Thomas Bein (LMU Munich), where the nanoparticles were synthesized. To deliver drugs into a cell, the extracellular membrane has to be crossed. Therefore, {{in the first part}} of this work, the internalization efficiency of PEG-shielded CMS nanoparticles into living HeLa cells was examined by a quenching assay. The internalization time scales varied considerably from cell to cell. However, about 67 % of PEG-shielded CMS nanoparticles were internalized by the cells within one hour. The time scale is found to be in the range of other nanoparticles (polyplexes, magnetic lipoplexes) that exhibit non-specific uptake. Besides internalization efficiency, successful drug loading and pore sealing are important parameters for drug delivery. To study this, CMS nanoparticles were loaded with the anti-cancer drug colchicine and sealed by a supported lipid bilayer using a solvent exchange method (additional collaboration with the group of Prof. Joachim Rädler, LMU). Spinning disk confocal live-cell imaging revealed that the nanoparticles were taken up into HuH 7 cells by endocytosis. As colchicine is known to exhibit toxicity towards microtubules, the microtubule network of the cells was destroyed within 2 h of incubation with the colchicine-loaded lipid bilayer-coated CMS nanoparticles. Although successful drug delivery was shown, it is necessary to develop controlled local release strategies. To achieve controlled drug release, CMS nanoparticles for redox-driven disulfide cleavage were synthesized. The particles contain the ATTO 633 -labeled amino acid cysteine bound via a disulfide linker to the inner volume. For reduction of the disulfide bond and release of cysteine, the CMS nanoparticles need to get into contact with the cytoplasmic reducing milieu of the target cell. We showed that nanoparticles were taken up by HuH 7 cells via endocytosis, but endosomal escape seems to be a bottleneck for this approach. Incubation of the cells with a photosensitizer (TPPS 2 a) and photoactivation led to endosomal escape and successful release of the drug. In addition, we showed that linkage of ATTO 633 at high concentration in the pores of silica nanoparticles results in quenching of the ATTO 633 fluorescence. Release of dye from the pores promotes a strong dequenching effect providing an intense fluorescence signal with excellent signal-to-noise ratio for single-particle imaging. With this approach, we were able to control the time of photoactivation and thus the time of endosomal rupture. However, the photosensitizer showed a high toxicity to the cell, due to its presence in the entire cellular membrane. To reduce cell toxicity induced by the photosensitizer and to achieve spatial control on the endosomal escape, the photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) was covalently surface-linked to the CMS nanoparticles and used as an on-board photosensitizer (additional collaboration with the groups of Prof. Joachim Rädler and Prof. Heinrich Leonhardt, both LMU). The nanoparticles were loaded with model drugs and equipped with a supported lipid bilayer as a removable encapsulation. Upon photoactivation, successful drug delivery was observed. The mode of action is proposed as a two step cascade, where the supported lipid bilayer is disintegrated by singlet oxygen in a first step and the endosomal membrane ruptures enabling drug release in a second step. With this system, stimuli-responsive and controlled, localized endosomal escape and drug release is achieved. Taken together, the data presented in this thesis show that real-time fluorescence imaging of CMS nanoparticles on a single-cell level is a powerful method to investigate in great detail the processes associated with drug delivery. Barriers in the internalization and drug delivery are detected and can be bypassed via new nanoparticle designs. These insights are of great importance for improvements in the design of existing and the synthesis of new drug delivery systems...|$|R
