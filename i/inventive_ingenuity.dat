60|$|I {{come home}} {{impressed}} {{with the fact that}} Britain has learned more from this war than any other nation, and will probably gain more by that knowledge. We are all wanting, of course, to know what we shall get out of it, since it was forced upon us; and of course the only gain worth considering--as many of those to whom its coming has brought home the first glimmerings of social science are beginning to see--is precisely a newly acquired vision of the art of self-government. It has been unfortunately necessary--or perhaps fortunately necessary--for the great democracies to turn their energies and resources and the <b>inventive</b> <b>ingenuity</b> of their citizens to the organization of armies and indeed of entire populations to the purpose of killing enough Germans to remove democracy's exterior menace. The price we pay in human life is appallingly unfortunate. But the necessity for national organization socializes the nation capable of it; or, to put the matter more truly, if the socializing process had anticipated the war--as it had in Great Britain--the ability to complete it under stress is the test of a democratic nation; and hence the test of democracy, since the socializing process becomes international. Britain has stood the test, even from the old-fashioned militarist point of view, since it is apparent that no democracy can wage a sustained great war unless it is socialized. After the war she will probably lead all other countries in a sane and scientific liberalization. The encouraging fact is that not in spite of her liberalism, but because of it, she has met military Germany on her own ground and, to use a vigorous expression, gone her one better. In 1914, as armies go today, the British Army was a mere handful of men whose officers belonged to a military caste. Brave men and brave officers, indeed! But at present it is a war organization of an excellence which the Germans never surpassed. I have no space to enter into a description of the amazing system, of the network of arteries converging at the channel ports and spreading out until it feeds and clothes every man of those millions, furnishes him with newspapers and tobacco, and gives him the greatest contentment compatible with the conditions under which he has to live. The number of shells flung at the enemy is only limited by the lives of the guns that fire them. I should like to tell with what swiftness, under the stress of battle, the wounded are hurried back to the coast and even to England itself. I may not state the thousands carried on leave every day across the channel and back again--in spite of submarines. But I went one day through Saint Omer, with its beautiful church and little blue chateau, past the rest-camps of the big regiments of guards to a seaport on the downs, formerly a quiet little French town, transformed now into an ordered Babel. The term is paradoxical, but I let it stand. English, Irish, and Scotch from the British Isles and {{the ends of the earth}} mingle there with Indians, Egyptians, and the chattering Mongolians in queer fur caps who work in the bakeries.|$|E
50|$|Though {{the designs}} of Grandville are {{occasionally}} unnatural and absurd, they usually display keen analysis of character and marvellous <b>inventive</b> <b>ingenuity,</b> and his humour is always tempered and refined by delicacy of sentiment and a vein of sober thoughtfulness. He died on 17 March 1847 and is buried in the Cimetière Nord of Saint-Mandé just outside Paris.|$|E
5000|$|Claudia Donovan (Allison Scagliotti). Myka has {{developed}} a big sister relationship with Claudia, which really began to mature in season 2. Myka is an important mentor to Claudia on her first field assignment in the season 2 episode [...] "For The Team" [...] and tricks her into believing in herself. Recognizing Claudia's potential, Myka has been very encouraging to her. Her belief in Claudia is reinforced when Myka writes in her season 2 resignation letter, [...] "I wish I could be there to see you grow into the amazing woman you're going to become." [...] Myka, {{as well as the}} entire Warehouse, often relies on Claudia's <b>inventive</b> <b>ingenuity</b> to devise gadgets to help get out of various predicaments.|$|E
50|$|Eccentric {{scientist}} and inventor Wayne Szalinski lives in his suburban home attempting to perfect a ray gun capable of shrinking objects, but the ray keeps blowing up the apples he uses as test subjects instead. After an argument between Wayne {{and his wife}} Diane, she spent the previous night {{with her mother and}} is currently at work, worrying her teenaged daughter Amy, and their son Nick, who has inherited his father's <b>inventive</b> <b>ingenuity</b> and intelligence. The Szalinskis' next door neighbors, the Thompsons, are getting ready for a fishing trip, but Russ' oldest son Little Russ is less than enthusiastic, as he and his father's interests often clash, resulting in him feeling belittled, and he is more interested in meeting Amy than spending the weekend camping. Younger son Ron, however, is enthusiastic, though his relationship with Russ Sr. is strained when he inadvertently sets off a booby trap in the yard.|$|E
40|$|A patent is a {{statutory}} grant which confers on an inventor or his legal successor {{the right to}} exclude others from using the invention. Patents have a limited duration, usually a period of at least 20 years. The granting of a patent is conditioned on novelty, a minimal degree of <b>inventive</b> <b>ingenuity,</b> and the industrial applicability of an invention. The patent as a legal righ...|$|E

Introduction: The true inventor, like the poet, is “born, not made. ” The subject of this thesis did not acquire the <b>inventive</b> <b>ingenuity</b> which {{characterized}} him their life. It was an inherited faculty. Sir Henry Bessemer’ father was a Frenchman who was employed in the mints of France about the time that Robespierre became dictator of the country, and was transferred from the mint to take charge of the public bakery that distributed bread to the mobs which thronged the street...|$|E
40|$|The Eskimos are {{a remarkably}} {{successful}} group of mankind. Their {{ability to adapt}} to difficult circumstances and to expand is accurately reflected in their geographical distribution. They stretch longitudinally around a large sector of the circumpolar world, and latitudinally from the subarctic into the high Arctic. With their closest relatives, the Aleuts, they occupy the longest linear distance of any single group in the world. Although this unique geographical distribution provides objective and conclusive evidence {{of their ability to}} expand, rather than simply survive, it does not automatically elucidate the processes of adaptation which are responsible. We must look at individual Eskimos and at communities of Eskimos through the methods of many disciplines, and then sift and integrate this information within the larger context of their population systems. Their physical abilities, their inventiveness, and their cheerfulness are as well known to the world as the words “Eskimo, ” “igloo, ” and “kayak. ” However, we do not know to what extent there are organic connections between physical endowments, genetic variability, <b>inventive</b> <b>ingenuity,</b> and cheerfulness of dis...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{discusses}} the often subtle tasks {{faced by the}} courts in construing close corporations law, which is state law. The judiciary in individual states has skillfully managed the invention, continuing development and ongoing evolution of lack of marketability and minority discounts as it strives to honor its constitutional mandate to resolve controversies between minority and majority shareholders in close corporations relating to valuing close corporations stock. These controversies arise {{in the context of}} share transactions in such corporations. Close corporations are traditionally not listed on stock exchanges, and the legislatures in some states have, in some instances, helped to facilitate the judiciary 2 ̆ 7 s ongoing <b>inventive</b> <b>ingenuity</b> in its continuing efforts to resolve these disputes in a context where there is usually no marketplace for the stockholders in close corporations to readily leave by selling their shares and moving on. This Article analyzes the approaches of the judiciary in individual states as the judiciaries in the states collectively pursue almost in synchrony the elusive judicial goal of a fair and equitable resolution of close corporation valuation problems that arise in a plethora of factual share transaction settings, which demand individually tailored solutions...|$|E
40|$|This article {{explores the}} ways in which war {{machines}} are elaborated within Rabelais’s narrative, and how they align with – or challenge – the moralising discourse surrounding technology in the mid-sixteenth century. Through close reading of the Gaster and Andouilles episodes, it argues that the ambiguity of the term engin, which is used to refer both to <b>inventive</b> <b>ingenuity</b> and its physical products, provides a rich seam in Rabelais’s fourth book for the exploration of the boundary between nature and artifice. As such antitheses come under strain, so on the other hand do analogous pairings prove to reveal significant differences. Engins are caught up, in Rabelais’s text, in a complex web of associations that includes poetic and technological invention, political leadership, religious worship, and, repeatedly, food. As this web of themes is mapped, it becomes apparent that tripe, in particular, plays a prominent role in mediating a series of symbolic relationships. From the stomach-god whose actions are described by the refrain ‘Et tout pour la trippe’, to the army of tripe sausages who worship a flying pig, the traditional epic association of battle and banquet is recast by Rabelais’s own extraordinary engin...|$|E
40|$|Through {{imperial}} logic, {{scientific knowledge}} {{has since been}} perceived along racial lines. The penultimate hierarchy of knowledge has created and continues to nourish natural imperialism where {{it has become the}} white menâ€™s burden to civilize the Africans. This research attempted to sterilize the celebrated falsehood that the Europeans have the â€˜scientific spiritâ€™ while the Africans have a â€˜magic conceptionâ€™ of nature. A historical appreciation of African innovative and <b>inventive</b> <b>ingenuity</b> was traced from the pre-colonial times to the present. The study drew insights from a broad evidentiary base that includes oral traditions, archival sources and secondary material. The research established that aloes were and continue to be administered for a variety of complaints like constipation and venereal diseases and other non-human disorders like the cure of disease in chickens. The calendar function of the stars and constellations is ascribed to early African agriculturalists who also exhibited an astounding knowledge of techniques of weather forecasting. The research confirmed that African indigenous knowledge systems, although rarely acknowledged, have provided the solid foundation upon which Europe has claimed dominance over the environment by cataloging and classifying plants, insects, animals and many other creations according to â€˜modernâ€™ criteria. The Africansâ€™ knowledge of the medicinal and nutritional properties of plants {{has been a source of}} commercial gain for multinational companies through bio-piracy which imperial logic seems to have justified. The challenge is the recognition of the diverse African knowledge systemâ€™s capacity to create wealth by formal institutions like schools, universities and work places. From a historical perspective, the study confirmed that indigenous knowledge has been and remains an integral part of the local ecosystem, a key element of the â€˜social capitalâ€™ of the underprivileged and the main asset to invest in Zimbabweâ€™s struggle for survival...|$|E
