5|$|After {{holding off}} the initial attacks by the Byzantines, the Muslim right wing fell back, {{followed}} by the right center. They were again said to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>met</b> by their own womenfolk who abused and shamed them. The corps, however, managed to reorganize {{some distance from the}} camp and held their ground preparing for a counterattack.|$|E
5|$|Claims of {{intermediate}} mass {{black holes}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>met</b> with some skepticism. The heaviest objects in globular clusters {{are expected to}} migrate to the cluster center due to mass segregation. As pointed out in two papers by Holger Baumgardt and collaborators, the mass-to-light ratio should rise sharply towards {{the center of the}} cluster, even without a black hole, in both M15 and Mayall II.|$|E

50|$|Secondly, an {{operational}} objective should be measurable and quantifiable {{so that people}} can know whether it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>met</b> or not. For example, an objective might be increasing sales revenue by ten percent. This would prevent the confusions and conflicts on whether it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>met</b> between different stakeholders.|$|R
5|$|Each {{level has}} set {{goals in the}} fields of {{financial}} attainment, hospital reputation, patients cured, and hospital value. Holding negative funds or allowing sufficient patients to die will bring about losing requirements. When the goals <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>met</b> the player has the option to move on to a new, more elaborate hospital with tougher winning conditions and more diseases present, or stick with their current one. If enough rats have been shot, the player is taken to a special level whose goal is to shoot as many as possible.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Bally Midway {{released}} a pinball {{version of the}} game. However, few elements from the original game are included, and the aliens instead resemble the xenomorphs from the film Alien; Bally Midway was later sued over the game's resemblance to designs by H. R. Giger. Different ports <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>met</b> with mixed receptions; the Atari 2600 version was very successful while the Nintendo Entertainment System version was poorly received.|$|E
5|$|In this period, {{there has}} also been {{widespread}} cosmetic changes to stations, including the restoration of historical murals, the incorporation of new artwork and improving the lighting. The renovations on Line B <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>met</b> with criticism for destroying parts of the line's historical patrimony, which dates back to the 1930s. The appearance of the network's signage has also been changed and the new signs have been gradually replacing the old ones since November 2014.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that given its proportion of the waste stream and the lack of distinct collections, food waste is not currently being targeted appropriately. However proposals by the European Union, which would require local authorities to provide separate collection of food and garden waste, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>met</b> with opposition; critics of the proposals argue that local authorities understand the specific needs of the areas they serve, and that they should decide waste policy. Advocates of the proposals say that it will ensure energy is not wasted in sorting biodegradable waste from other materials.|$|E
5|$|Plan 9 proponents and {{developers}} {{claim that the}} problems hindering its adoption have been solved, that its original goals as a distributed system, development environment, and research platform <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>met,</b> and that it enjoys moderate but growing popularity. Inferno, through its hosted capabilities, has been a vehicle for bringing Plan 9 technologies to other systems as a hosted part of heterogeneous computing grids.|$|E
5|$|Where the Prime Minister's {{remuneration}} was concerned, the Committee {{recommended that}} it be pegged to twice of a MR4-grade minister's salary and doing away with the fixed service bonus. Instead, the Prime Minister will receive a larger national bonus. His annual bonus where the targets for the indicators <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>met</b> will be six months' salary, and 12 months' salary {{where they have been}} greatly exceeded. This will lead to a reduction in the Prime Minister's annual salary of 28% to $2.2 million (about US$1.7 million). Lee Hsien Loong said that he accepted the Committee's recommendations. He remains the best-paid head of government in the world, his proposed annual pay package exceeding that of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong Donald Tsang, the political leader with the second-highest salary in the world (around US$550,000), by about three times; and that of the President of the United States Barack Obama (US$400,000) by over four times.|$|E

5|$|Empire City {{is built}} on three islands, and the player must work through main story {{missions}} on each island before being able to access the next one, though future missions may require the player to return to an earlier island. Each island is divided {{into a number of}} sectors, {{at the start of the}} game controlled by three different gangs, the Neon District being controlled by Sasha and her Reaper Gang, the Warren District being controlled by Alden and the Dust Men Gang, and the Historic District being controlled by Kessler and the First Sons. The player can undertake a side mission in each sector, once certain main story requirements <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>met,</b> to free that sector from gang control, reducing or eliminating the presence of the gang in that sector. Other side missions may also unlock medical stations where Cole will re-awaken should he die. Though Cole must travel on foot he eventually gains powers that allow him to grind along power cables and powered, elevated train rails and to hover for a short time. Scattered around the city are hundreds of 'Blast Shards' which Cole can collect to increase the amount of electricity he can store. There are 32 'Dead Drop' satellite transmitters that help to reveal more of the back-story in the game, all being narrated by John White, or being recordings of Kessler and his experiments.|$|E
5|$|The former Exchange Building, {{from which}} The Exchange takes its name, was an {{impressive}} structure, designed by William Mason as a Post Office and later {{occupied by the}} University of Otago and the Otago Museum. Next to this was the 1863 Customhouse building, and outside the two was an open space known as Customhouse Square. The Exchange building was pulled down in 1969, and it was largely the destruction of this building that led to changes in attitudes by Dunedinites regarding the change of their cityscape. Since this time, changes to the city's old buildings <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>met</b> with vociferous protests. The Customhouse building is also long since gone. Today, {{the site of the}} buildings is the location of Dunedin's biggest office block, John Wickliffe House, and the nearby John Wickliffe Plaza. Both are named for the John Wickliffe, the first of the two ships which brought the Otago Association's settlers to Dunedin (a nearby building, Philip Laing House, is named for the other of these two ships). Despite this, the area is the site of several prominent Victorian buildings, notably former bank buildings at the northern end of the area. Other imposing buildings in the area include the Chief Post Office building, the proposed site of a hotel, and - one block to the east - Consultancy House, a seven-storey 1908 building regarded (by dint of its construction methods) as Dunedin's first skyscraper. John Wickliffe Plaza is also the site of one of Dunedin's more notable public monuments, dedicated to city founder Captain William Cargill. This monument, designed by Charles Robert Swyer and built in 1863-4, was originally sited in the Octagon, but was moved to the Exchange in 1872.|$|E
