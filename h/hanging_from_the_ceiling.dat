5|$|Upon {{arriving}} in New York, Mary finds that Jacqueline sold her cosmetics business eight months earlier. Jacqueline's {{close friend and}} former employee, Frances Fallon (Isabel Jewell), claims to have seen Jacqueline the week before, and suggests that Mary visit Dante's, an Italian restaurant in Greenwich Village. Mary locates the restaurant, and discovers that Jacqueline has rented a room above the store, without having moved in. Mary convinces the owners to let her see the room, which she finds empty aside from a wooden chair and above it a noose <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> This makes Mary more anxious and determined to find her sister.|$|E
5|$|The niche image {{carved on}} the {{southwest}} wall, near the Linga shrine (see 6 on plan) is the wedding of Shiva and Parvati. This legend is called the Kalyanasundara in Hindu texts. Parvati is seen standing to Shiva's right, the customary place for a Hindu bride at the wedding. The carvings are substantially damaged, but the ruined remains of the sculpture has been significant to scholarly studies of Hindu literature. In many surviving versions of the Puranas, the wedding takes place in King Parvata's palace. However, in this Elephanta Cave panel, the narrative shows some earlier version. Here King Parvata standing behind Parvati gives away the bride to Shiva while Brahma is the priest in the grotto relief. Gods, goddesses and celestial apsaras are cheering witness to the wedding. Vishnu is witness to the marriage, standing tall behind the sitting Brahma {{on the right side}} of the panel. Just above the main images rishi (sages) and a few characters <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> are seen blessing the wedding.|$|E

25|$|On 10 June 2002, Fulton, who {{was being}} held on remand in HMP Maghaberry since December 2001, {{was found dead in}} his prison cell with a leather belt around his neck. Fulton was found on his bed rather than <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> leading to {{speculation}} that he has death had been accidentally caused by autoerotic asphyxiation. Friends claimed he had expressed suicidal thoughts due to both his failure to recover from his close friend Wright's death, as well as fears he had that he was suffering from stomach cancer. Some reports suggested his unstable mental state had seen him stood down as leader several weeks before his death, with the LVF's power base transferred to Belfast.

25|$|The {{entrance}} is {{situated at the}} back of the Saw Plaza. The exterior queue line consists of mock razor wire fences and various large torture implements rusting on the ground (most of which come from the films). Walkie talkie announcements are heard from policemen inside the building, often sounding as if they are panicking. Loud ambient music is played throughout the area. The queue travels around the back of the warehouse and then into the building itself. Inside, riders walk through a dimly lit corridor, with four shotguns <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> The guns 'fire' every few minutes to give a jump effect. The corridor leads up some stairs past a cage with a trap (the Rack from Saw III) seen in it. On special occasions, live actors are placed in this cage and act as Jigsaw's victims. Travelling up the stairs, Billy the Puppet can be seen and heard on TV monitors up the stairs to the station. Above the queue, a body is seen tangled in barbed wire (referencing the first Saw), before the queue goes into the station. In here, mannequin parts are fixed in various small devices or hanging from the walls, and misted windows flash on the wall opposite the queue.|$|E

5000|$|His {{interior}} decor {{ideas were}} all original.

Occasionally 'extra decorative touches' would appear like gaudy, tissue-paper flowers from Mexico sprouting in corners.
