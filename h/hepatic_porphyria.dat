40|$|INVITED REVIEW ABSTRACT: The <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyrias</b> are a {{group of}} rare {{metabolic}} disor-ders characterized by enzymatic defects in the biosynthesis of heme, a metalloporphyrin that is the principal product of porphyrin metabolism. The <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyrias</b> are genetically transmitted as autosomal-dominant dis-orders with variable expression that produce a particularly severe form of neuropathy. Most medical students readily recognize acute attacks of por-phyria when the classic triad of abdominal pain, psychosis, and neuropathy is present. Yet, porphyric neuropathy {{is a source of}} confusion in practice, and patients with porphyria rarely receive the correct diagnosis early {{in the course of the}} illness. Porphyric neuropathy is manifest by symptoms, signs, and cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities resembling acute Guillain–Barre ́ syn-drome. However, accompanying psychological features, a proximal predi-lection of asymmetric weakness, and electrodiagnostic findings indicative of an axonal polyradiculopathy or neuronopathy all suggest the diagnosis of porphyria. Confirmation of the diagnosis depends on use of appropriate laboratory studies. The underlying pathophysiology of porphyric neuropathy has not been established, but it may be related to direct neurotoxicity of elevated levels of -aminolevulinic acid. The severity of the neuropathy and the availability of potential treatments, including avoidance of provocative factors, make identification important...|$|R

40|$|The inborn {{errors of}} heme biosynthesis, the porphyrias, are 8 genetically {{distinct}} metabolic disorders {{that can be}} classified as “acute hepatic, ” “hepatic cutaneous, ” and “erythropoietic cutaneous ” diseases. Recent advances in understanding their pathogenesis and molecular genetic heterogeneity have led to improved diagnosis and treatment. These advances include DNA-based diagnoses for all the porphyrias, new understanding of the pathogenesis of the acute <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyrias,</b> identification of the iron overload-induced inhibitor of hepatic uroporphyrin decarboxylase activity that causes the most common porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda, the identification of an X-linked form of erythropoietic protoporphyria due to gain-of-function mutations in erythroid-specific 5 -aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS 2), and new and experimental treatments for the erythropoietic prophyrias. Knowledge of these advances is relevant for hematologists because they administer the hematin infusions to treat the acute attacks in patients with the acute <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyrias,</b> perform the chronic phlebotomies to reduce the iron overload and clear the dermatologic lesions in porphyria cutanea tarda, and diagnose and treat the erythropoietic porphyrias, including chronic erythrocyte transfusions, bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplants, and experimental pharmacologic chaperone and stem cell gene therapies for congenital erythropoietic protoporphyria.

40|$|The acute <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyrias</b> {{are caused}} by {{inherited}} enzymatic deficiencies in the heme biosynthesis pathway. Induction of the first enzyme 5 -aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS 1) by triggers such as fasting or drug exposure can lead to accumulation of neurotoxic heme intermediates that cause disease symptoms. We have demonstrated that hepatic ALAS 1 silencing using siRNA in a lipid nanoparticle effectively prevents and treats induced attacks in a mouse model of acute intermittent porphyria. Herein, we report the development of ALN-AS 1, an investigational GalNAc-conjugated RNAi therapeutic targeting ALAS 1. One challenge in advancing ALN-AS 1 to patients is the inability to detect liver ALAS 1 mRNA {{in the absence of}} liver biopsies. We here describe a less invasive circulating extracellular RNA detection assay to monitor RNAi drug activity in serum and urine. A striking correlation in ALAS 1 mRNA was observed across liver, serum, and urine in both rodents and nonhuman primates (NHPs) following treatment with ALN-AS 1. Moreover, in donor-matched human urine and serum, we demonstrate a notable correspondence in ALAS 1 levels, minimal interday assay variability, low interpatient variability from serial sample collections, and the ability to distinguish between healthy volunteers and porphyria patients with induced ALAS 1 levels. The collective data highlight the potential utility of this assay in the clinical development of ALN-AS 1, and in broadening our understanding of acute <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyrias</b> disease pathophysiology...|$|R

40|$|We have {{reported}} previously that the hepatic heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) -eukaryotic initiation factor 2 α (eIF 2 α) kinase is activated in acute heme-deficient states, resulting in translational shut-off of global hepatic protein synthesis, including phenobarbital (PB) -mediated induction of CYP 2 B enzymes in rats. These findings revealed that heme regulates hepatic CYP 2 B synthesis at the translational level via HRI. As a proof of concept, {{we have now}} employed a genetic HRI-knockout (KO) mouse hepatocyte model. In HRI-KO hepatocytes, PB-mediated CYP 2 B protein induction is no longer regulated by hepatic heme availability and proceeds undeterred even after acute hepatic heme depletion. It is noteworthy that genetic ablation of HRI led to a small albeit significant elevation of basal hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as revealed by the activation of ER stress-inducible RNA-dependent protein kinase-like ER-integral (PERK) eIF 2 α-kinase, and induction of hepatic protein ubiquitination and ER chaperones Grp 78 and Grp 94. Such ER stress was further augmented after PB-mediated hepatic protein induction. These findings suggest that HRI normally modulates the basal hepatic ER stress tone. Furthermore, because HRI exists in both human and rat liver in its heme-sensitive form and is inducible by cytochrome P 450 inducers such as PB, these findings are clinically relevant to acute heme-deficient states, such as the acute <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyrias.</b> Activation of this exquisitely sensitive heme sensor would normally protect cells by safeguarding cellular energy and nutrients during acute heme deficiency. However, similar HRI activation in genetically predisposed persons could lead to global translational arrest of physiologically relevant enzymes and proteins, resulting in the severe and often fatal clinical symptoms of the acute <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyrias...</b>|$|R

The addition of low concentrations of zinc-mesoporphyrin (50 - 200 nM), an inhibitor of heme oxygenase, led to more prolonged decreases in activity of the synthase and to an additive effect with heme. These effects of zinc-mesoporphyrin were associated with prolonged inhibition of heme oxygenase.

Biochemical and molecular testing can be used to narrow down the diagnosis of a porphyria and identify the specific genetic defect. Overall, porphyrias are rare diseases.

40|$|Most {{patients}} with <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyria</b> exhibit neuropsychiatric symptoms, including abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, confusion, insomnia and mental disturbances such as anxiety and depression. Although heme deficiency and accumulation of heme precursors {{are thought to}} be responsible for neuropsychiatric manifestations in {{patients with}} acute porphyria, the pathogenetic mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the present study, we observed psychiatric behaviors in mice with <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyria</b> induced by the ingestion of a griseofulvin (GF) -containing diet over a period of 12 weeks. GF ingestion by the mice caused an accumulation of porphyrins in the feces and a decrease in heme in the liver; these effects were observed throughout the entire duration of the experiment, with maximum levels observed after circa 1 week of ingestion of this diet. In addition, the mice developed enlargement of the liver, hepatocyte injury, and cholestasis. Mice with <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyria</b> manifested an anxiety-like behavior by the long-term treatment (over 5 weeks) in a GF-dose and duration dependent manner. The <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyria</b> mice also manifested depression-like behaviors by the short-term treatment (3 weeks) of GF 2. 0, which was reversed by administration of anti-depressant, imipramine.
