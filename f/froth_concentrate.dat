40|$|A novel {{two-stage}} {{froth flotation}} {{process for the}} recovery of pure magnesite from low grade ores is described. The process consists of a first-stage, magnesite flotation step where a rougher magnesite concentrate is floated with amine collectors. The first-stage <b>froth</b> <b>concentrate</b> is then repulped in fresh water, and quartenary ammonium salt and fuel oil are added to float the remaining impurities. The results from laboratory batch tests show that a high-grade magnesite concentrate assaying 0. 99 - 0. 20 % SiO// 2 and 2. 84 - 0. 46 % CaO can be produced. Regulation of the variables controlling magnesite froth flotation also allows the variation of the ratio %CaO:%SiO// 2, between the acceptable limits 0. 32 to 5. 79. This ratio {{is important to the}} quality of dead-burned magnesite...|$|E
40|$|Flotation is used {{extensively}} in mineral processing to separate valuable minerals from unwanted gangue material. Typically, the solids are {{suspended in the}} pulp and captured by bubbles which then rise to the surface to form a <b>froth</b> <b>concentrate.</b> In flotation, much of the energy utilization is directed into the creation of fine bubbles to increase collision efficiency and product recovery. This study was aimed at quantifying the flotation performance of mixtures of hydrophobic and hydrophilic particles being dropped directly onto a moving water surface. Mixtures of coal and silica particles (0 - 100 wt% coal), with diameters 180 - 212 micrometers, were dropped from 300 millimetres above the water surface at a surface loading of approximately 0. 03 kg/m²•s, corresponding to 0. 11 m² particles/m² water surface per second. The grade and recoveries of the coal product {{were found to be}} 90 - 92 % and 96 - 100 %, respectively, and corresponded well with the theoretical prediction of fall height where the coal particles float while the silica particles sink. It seems, therefore, that the modelling for single particle interaction with a free surface is broadly applicable to different particle mixtures...|$|E
40|$|Sillimanite is an alumino-silicate mineral {{with the}} {{chemical}} formula Al 2 SiO 5. The Sillimanite mineral {{is subjected to}} classification, followed by flotation for separation of Ilmenite, Rutile, Zircon and Garnet. Rejects from which essentially consists of quartz, sillimanite with other in minor qualities needs to be concentrated to achieve higher grade of mineral sillimanite {{it is necessary to}} meet the stringent quality requirements of the market. A typical ROM feed, comprising 8 - 9 % sillimanite along with other heavy minerals, is treated in the Primary Concentration Plant (PCP) and further upgraded in WSC with flotation cells to produce <b>froth</b> <b>concentrate</b> containing 85 % sillimanite. In the flotation process, Oleic acid is used as a collector cum frother, Sodium silicate as depressant and Soda ash to regulate pH. The sillimanite concentrate is then treated in the Mineral Separation Plant (MSP) to produce a saleable final product with > 96 % sillimanite. In Trimex Sands Private Limited, Conventional mechanical flotation cells were installed to float sillimanite. In addition to traditional problems associated with conventional cells, higher content of iron oxide (2 % against 0. 7 %) in the final product due to presence of fine garnet complicated the flotation operation there by leading to lower recoveries coupled with inferior grades. The main aim of the present investigation deals with the two fold objectives (i) To enhance the process operation thereby increasing the recovery of the sillimanite concentrate (ii) To reduce the iron content in the concentrate to produce marketable final product...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Machine vision systems {{typically}} classify {{images of}} a flotation froth surface into one of a distinct set of classes. This process typically involves having an experienced operator identify a set of froth classes. After this, a machine vision system is trained to identify these froth classes. Identifying these froth classes is particularly challenging for froths which have “dynamic ” bubble size distributions. Using unsupervised clustering algorithms, {{it is possible to}} automatically learn these froth classes without user input. Validation of this technique is done by showing that the identified froth classes have statistically different relationships between the <b>froth</b> velocity and <b>concentrate</b> grade...|$|R
40|$|The Mulled Coal {{process was}} {{developed}} {{as a means of}} overcoming the adverse handling characteristics of wet fine coal without thermal drying. The process involves the addition of a low cost harmless reagent to wet fine coal using off-the-shelf mixing equipment. Based on laboratory- and bench-scale testing, Mulled Coal can be stored, shipped, and burned without causing any of the plugging, pasting, carryback and freezing problems normally associated with wet coal. The objectives of this project are to demonstrate that: The Mulled Coal process, which has been proven to work {{on a wide range of}} wet fine coals at bench scale, will work equally well in a commercial coal preparation plant. The wet product from a fine coal cleaning circuit can be converted to a solid fuel form for ease of handling and cost savings in storage and rail car transportation. A wet fine coal product thus converted to a solid fuel form can be stored, shipped, and burned with conventional fuel handling, transportation, and combustion systems. The Mulled Coal circuit was installed in an empty bay at the Chetopa Preparation Plant. Equipment has been installed to divert a 2. 7 tonnes/hr (3 tons/hr) slipstream of the <b>froth</b> <b>concentrate</b> to a dewatering centrifuge. The concentrated wet coal fines from the centrifuge dropped through a chute directly into a surge hopper and feed system for the Mulled Coal circuit. The Mulled Coal product was gravity discharged from the circuit to a truck or product discharge area from which it will be hauled to a stockpile located at the edge of the clean coal stockpile area. During the 3 -month operating period, the facility produced 870 tonnes (966 tons) of the Muffed Coal for evaluation in various storage, handling, and transportation equipment and operations.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Flotation is a {{well-known}} separation process widely used in many industrial processes. The fundamental principle of conventional flotation is that the hydrophobic particles are captured by the rising bubbles and carried into the <b>froth</b> <b>concentrate.</b> Flotation recovery is governed by surface properties, size of both particles and bubbles, and energy dissipation within the cell. Often, high energy input is needed to suspend the solids and to propagate bubble-particle interaction. The detrimental effect of operating under these conditions is that the probability of particle detachment is increased resulting in a lowering of flotation recovery. The focus of this PhD study {{was to develop a}} flotation environment whereby energy requirements for solids suspension, bubble generation, and bubble-particle contact are decoupled and optimized independently. A consideration of such a system has led to the notion of flotation of airborne particles, whereby falling particles are impacted upon a free liquid surface and depending upon their surface properties, will either penetrate through or be captured at the gas-liquid interface. Generally, the approach is referred to as film flotation, and has the advantage that energy requirements for bubble generation and interaction of the particles with the gas-liquid interface are no longer required. A mathematical model was developed that described the behaviour of a particle impacting with a gas-liquid interface. The model was based on a system which included the receiving liquid volume and the falling particle that was travelling at a critical velocity, vc. Beyond this value the particle would penetrate entirely through the gas-liquid interface. An energy balance was applied to the system at the critical condition, which could be solved to obtain (1) the critical velocity and corresponding critical fall height of the particle; (2) velocity profile of the particle as it passed through the liquid; and (3) resultant profile of the gas-liquid interface. The model was based on the physical and surface properties of both the liquid and particle and accounted for the presence of a confining solid boundary. Moreover, the model also incorporated the dynamic behaviour of the advancing contact angle. An extensive experimental program was carried out as part of the study. The critical impact velocity for glass beads, polypropylene spheres, non-spherical seeds, and coal and silica particles were determined by dropping them from different heights and recording their interaction with the liquid volume. The liquids included Milli-Q water, NaCl, sucrose and surfactant (CTAB) solutions. The velocities of both the particle and the gas-liquid interface (three phase contact line) moving over the surface of the particle were recorded using high speed video for each experimental system. The high speed imaging also allowed the temporal cavity profile and advancing contact angle to be measured. Experimental studies showed that the critical impact velocity increased with (i) an increase in hydrophobicity and surface tension and (ii) a decrease in particle size and ratio of particle-liquid density. The motions of the particle and three phase contact line (TPCL) were measured from the high speed video images. It was found that the velocities of both the particle and the TPCL could be fitted as a function of particle position relative to the interface by a simple quadratic relationship using only the dimensionless parameter, m and n. The relative velocity difference was then able to be used to estimate the advancing contact angle, by applying a combined molecular-hydrodynamic approach, which changes magnitude as the particle moves through the liquid. Finally, {{it was found that the}} critical fall height could be successfully modelled by using m and n only and including the influence of advancing contact angle. It was found that for a particle penetrating into a confined volume of liquid that the critical velocity increased with increasing static contact angle of the container wall. The critical velocity remained relatively unchanged with particle-to-liquid volume fraction less than 0. 05. The liquid depth also seemed to have little influence on vc for the different liquids tested. However, for a given particle diameter vc was found to decrease with decreasing container diameter, especially when the particle-to-container diameter ratio increased beyond about 0. 2. The experimental system was also modelled using the Young-Laplace equation using both static and advancing contact angle measurements for both the particle and container surfaces. The model predictions were generally in good agreement with the experimental observations, including showing increase in particle penetration depth with increasing diameter and meniscus profiles, both at the particle impact point and the wall of the container. The predictions were improved when the advancing contact angle was used, especially for the smaller diameter containers where there was more liquid motion. A simple model was also presented, based on the Young-Laplace equation, which could provide an estimation of the critical (minimum) diameter of container required so that the cavity profile generated by the impacting particle is unlikely to be influenced by the container walls. The estimated critical diameter was consistent with experimental observations. Float fraction experiments for non-spherical particles (black sesame seeds) followed a similar trend to those of spherical particles, in that at a higher impact velocity the particle was more likely to report to sinks stream. The orientation of particle also had a major effect on the critical velocity, with a minimum value occurring when the particle impacted the interface on its sharpest point. The spherical particle impact model used to determine the critical fall height was still applicable, however, provided the impact orientation of the non-spherical was taken into account. For a two particle system it was found that there was an increase in the normalised critical velocity as the normalised separation distance was decreased. However, this increase is likely to be less than about 10 percent. It seemed that there was no effect of the normalised separation distance of greater than 0. 043 on the critical impact velocity of particles. Particle image velocimetry measurements were undertaken in an attempt to quantify the liquid velocities generated by the moving particle. The experimental observations highlighted the fluid motion and provided quantitative evidence that it was reasonable to assume that the liquid possessed negligible kinetic energy due to its very low velocity, at the (critical) point where the impacting particle attained zero downward velocity. It was also observed that at the critical point there was still motion at the TPCL. For this reason, the modelling analysis should include the advancing contact angle. Finally, the model was applied to the design of a continuous film flotation device for used for the separation of a coal-silica mixture. The fall height was designed so that the impact velocities for the coal and silica particles were below and above their critical velocities, respectively, it was found that greater than 95 percent of coal recovery could be achieved. However, both grade and recovery were reduced with increased loading of floating particles on the free surface. In conclusion, the research to date has highlighted the potential of the new approach in providing a low energy alternative to conventional flotation. The successful separation of coal-silica mixtures indicates the possibility for separating ore particles and gangue particles by choosing an appropriate fall height based on the mathematical model developed in the thesis. The experimental rig includes a belt from which the particle mixtures can be projected onto the liquid surface with an ability of adjusting fall height, and the equipment could be modified or redesigned to improve the efficiency so that it could be used in industrial flotation, e. g. widening the belt, adding more belts on the same surface, speeding up the belt and liquid surface velocity...|$|E

40|$|A {{literature}} review has highlighted {{the need to}} measure flotation froth rheology in order to fully characterise {{the role of the}} froth in the flotation process. The initial investigation using a coaxial cylinder viscometer for froth rheology measurement {{led to the development of}} a new device employing a vane measuring head. The modified rheometer was used in industrial scale flotation tests at Mt. Isa Copper Concentrator. The measured froth rheograms show a non-Newtonian nature for the flotation froths (pseudoplastic flow). The evidence of the non-Newtonian flow has questioned the validity of application of the Laplace equation in froth motion modelling as used by a number of researchers, since the assumption of irrotational flow is violated. Correlations between the froth rheology and the froth retention time, water hold-up in the <b>froth</b> and <b>concentrate</b> grades have been found. These correlations are independent of air flow rate (test data at various air flow rates fall on one similar trend line). This implies that froth rheology may be used as a lumped parameter for other operating variables in flotation modelling and scale up. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{flotation}} cell {{was used in}} which hydrophobic particles act as film breakers and sink through the <b>froth</b> as <b>concentrate,</b> while hydrophilic particles are supported by the upward flow of froth and are recovered as a top product tailings. Experimental results on density tracers showed that the behaviour of particles (within the size range tested) in the froth phase of the cell is primarily dependent on the mass of a particle. In general, the higher the mass, the steeper is the trajectory of the particle in the froth i. e., an increase in particle mass results in an increased recovery to the concentrate. The contact angle on the particle surface has only a secondary influence on the overall particle trajectory, in that {{an increase in the}} equilibrium contact angle will result in an increased recovery. However, the particle contact angle has very little influence on the behaviour of large, high-density particles, as well as small, low-density particles. Particles will therefore only separate on the basis of contact angle as long as their mass is between an upper and lower critical value. Any particle with a mass greater than the critical value will fall through the froth irrespective of the contact angle. Similarly, the upward force component acting on a particle with mass less than the lower critical value will dominate the force balance. The particle will therefore remain supported by the froth, irrespective of the particle contact angle and bubble film rupture time. For particles within these mass limits, the effect of the contact angle increases with a decreased mass. It was further concluded that these mass limits are dependent on the operating conditions of the cell as well as the particle shape. The particle shape determines the mass to cross-sectional surface area ratio (M/A 0). Where particles therefore have the same mass, the M/A 0 ratio would govern the particle trajectory. The higher the M/A 0 ratio, the more particles would be recovered to the concentrate, while a decrease in the M/A 0 ratio would result in flatter particle trajectories in the froth, thereby increasing the probability of a particle reporting to the tailings. A mathematical model provides an understanding of the interrelationship between the various parameters. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. Articl...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 237 - 244). Numerous, {{machine vision}} systems for froth flotation {{have been developed}} over the last ten years; however, there are {{many aspects of the}} systems, that still require further development before they become one of the standard instruments present on industrial flotation operations. This thesis aims to address these problems by developing improved measurement techniques and showing how these measurements can be used to model the concentrate grad e of the flotation cell being monitored in a manner which is, directly usable by plant personnel. This thesis, presents an improvement to the watershed algorithm for the measurement of bubble sixe distribution in flotation froths. Unlike the standard watershed algorithm, it is able to measure accurate bubble size distributions when both large and tiny bubbles are present in a flotation froth image. Flotation froths with “dynamic bubble size distribution s” are introduced and methods of reducing the high dimensional bubble size distribution data associated with them are discussed. A method of using characteristic histograms of frequently occurring bubble size distributions is introduced and shown to be an appropriate method to use. A number of standard texture measures are best suited to the classification of flotation froth images. Results show that the Fourier ring and texture spectrum based features, perform well whilst having a relatively small computational cost for classifying new images. Video footage from selected industrial operations has been used for the development of improved algorithms for the measurement of froth surface descriptors. Analyses of the relationship, between froth velocity, bubble size, <b>froth</b> class and <b>concentrate</b> grade are made. The results show that it possible to use a unified approach to model the concentrate grade, irrespective of the site on which the measurements are made. Results from three industrial case studies show that bubble size and texture measures can be used to identify froth classes. Furthermore the combination of froth classes and froth velocity information is shown to consistently account for the most variation in the data when the concentrate grade is modelled using a linear combination of these two measurements...|$|R
