50|$|For better <b>foot</b> <b>traction,</b> the stood-on {{surface of}} most boards is {{manufactured}} with an unsmooth texture: for plastic models, in the molding; for wooden models, with grip tape or rubber. A smooth surface under the feet or shoes {{can cause a}} user to slip off a balance board and fall.|$|E
40|$|Hand {{force and}} posture are key {{determinants}} of body loads during standing hand-force exertions. Current digital human modeling tools lack validated posture prediction algorithms and assume the force requested {{is representative of}} the actual hand force. Furthermore, a change in hand force is not reflected in the simulated task posture. To address this need, a three-dimensional whole-body posture-prediction model was developed based on the following general biomechanical hypothesis: People choose postures that maintain shoulder moments below a threshold, and minimize lower-back torsion, while maintaining their torso orientation near vertical. To tune and validate the model, posture data were gathered from nineteen men and women in a laboratory study of force exertions with one and two hands. Participants exerted maximum forces and 25 %, 50 %, and 75 % of maximum at three handle heights. The exertions included pushes, pulls, and vertical up/down exertions against a stationary handle. Posture and force data were analyzed for use in a hybrid biomechanical/empirical model formulation. The off-axis forces that were observed were consistent with participants reducing shoulder moment and increasing ground reaction force to improve <b>foot</b> <b>traction.</b> Shoulder flexion/extension moments were {{less than or equal to}} 37 Nm in 90 % of trials, regardless of hand force magnitude and direction. Pelvis location and orientation during one-hand exertions support the hypothesis that postures are selected to reduce rotational moments about the lumbar spine. A tradeoff between torso inclination and change in shoulder position with increasing hand force was observed for exertions performed at a mid-thigh handle-height. Across both one- and two-handed exertions, shoulder flexion/extension moment was found to be well predicted with an adjusted R 2 value of 0. 82 and 0. 92, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 10. 7 Nm and 5. 48 Nm for one- and two-handed trials, respectively. The resulting posture-prediction model showed good performance for push/pull exertions. For up/down exertions, the wide range of tactics demonstrated by the study participants limited the model performance. Agreement between observed and predicted postural metrics was good when validated against 20 % of trials withheld from the original dataset, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0. 847 to 0. 531 for all exertions...|$|E

50|$|A farrier's routine work is {{primarily}} hoof trimming and shoeing. In ordinary cases, {{it is important}} to trim each hoof so it retains its proper orientation to the ground. If the animal has a heavy work load, works on abrasive <b>footing,</b> needs additional <b>traction,</b> or has pathological changes in the hoof, then shoes may be required.|$|R
5000|$|While {{animals and}} persons found <b>footing</b> and <b>traction</b> to be {{difficult}} in the loose sands of the dunes, what was most dreaded was the difficulty of hauling loaded wagons or carts through the sand. These vehicles could bog down to their hubs. [...] Some merchants going south from El Paso started out with carts loaded with goods, but would hire a mule train to accompany them. On arrival at the dunes, the goods from the carts would be loaded on the mule train and the emptied carts would then be pulled over the dunes. On {{the south side of}} the dunes the carts would be reloaded and proceed.|$|R
5|$|Cross-country skiing has {{two basic}} {{propulsion}} techniques, which apply to different surfaces: classic (undisturbed snow and tracked snow) and skate skiing (firm, smooth snow surfaces). The classic technique {{relies on a}} wax or texture on the ski bottom under the <b>foot</b> for <b>traction</b> on the snow to allow the skier to slide the other ski forward in virgin or tracked snow. With the skate skiing technique a skier slides on alternating skis on a firm snow surface at an angle {{from each other in}} a manner similar to ice skating. Both techniques employ poles with baskets that allow the arms to participate in the propulsion. Specialized equipment is adapted to each technique and each type of terrain. A variety of turns are used, when descending.|$|R
50|$|While {{retaining}} {{a general}} build like {{those found in}} the amphibian reptiliomorph groups like Seymouriamorpha and Diadectomorpha, Casineria also shows features that tie it in with early reptiles, notably a generally gracile build with light leg bones, unfused ankles and toes terminating in claws. This would enable the animal to use their <b>feet</b> actively in <b>traction,</b> rather than as holdfasts, an indication of a primarily terrestrial lifestyle. These traits show it was more closely related to amniotes than to other known reptiliomorph amphibians.|$|R
50|$|Limnoscelis is a genus {{of large}} (1.5 m in total length), very reptile-like diadectomorph (a type of reptile-like amphibian) from the Early Permian of North America. Contrary to other diadectomorphans, Limnoscelis {{appear to have}} been carnivorous. Though the post cranial {{skeleton}} is very similar to the early large bodied reptiles like pelycosaurs and pareiasaurs, the digits lacked claws, and the bones of the ankle bones were fused like in other reptile-like amphibians. This would not allow them to use their <b>feet</b> actively in <b>traction,</b> but rather as holdfasts, indicating Limnoscelis primarily hunted slow moving prey.|$|R
40|$|This {{is a work}} of fiction. Its {{purpose is}} to enlighten, entertain, portray, and illuminate. The {{characters}} in these stories are all related, in some ways, to the fictional Chinese village of Xinchun. Here is a sample: “A runner arrived at Xinchun Village two days after the fall of Taiyuan. Out of breath, his Kuomingtang uniform soaked in sweat, the soldier collapsed into a fly-infested ditch on the outskirts of a sorghum field. That evening, San saw him on her way back from tending her family’s two goats, the man lying there snoring, and when she told her parents about him, they didn’t believe her. San, nine years old, often lied to her parents. The Japanese were here one week, the Russians the next. Her parents knew San hated shepherding and dismissed her pleas to save the young man from becoming pig fodder. After putting her to sleep, San’s father slung a hoe over his shoulder and walked across his fields under moonlight to make sure. He couldn’t lift the man out of the mud by himself, even after taking off his own shoes and using his bare <b>feet</b> for <b>traction.</b> He ran to the village chief, who sent a neighbor to help him. Together with one man lifting the head and the other the legs, they carried him to the granary and dropped him beside sacks of recently harvested sorghum. ”...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Effects of {{vibrating}} {{structure on}} the free-field motion are presented through a field experiment at the Euro-Seistest and a corresponding numerical simulation. Ground motion {{has been recorded}} by a dense temporary three-component (3 C), two-dimensional (2 D) seismic network installed at increasing distances from a model building forced into vibration by pull-out tests. The building is a five-story RC structure at a one-third scale, resting on the soil through surface square <b>footing.</b> A <b>traction</b> force, F 0, applied at the building top and suddenly released forced it into vibrations. Two sequences of a pull-out test (POT) have been performed, each one made of two vibration tests in the two horizontal directions of the building (longitudinal and transverse). The experimental data are then compared {{to the results of}} the numerical simulation. The soil-structure system is modeled by a three degree of freedom (3 DOF) system. The soil-structure interaction (SSI) is accounted for through the help of impedance functions, and the motion induced by POT are estimated together with the base force and moment developed at the soil-structure interface. By representing the base forces by surface point seismic sources, the induced wavefield radiated in the surrounding free field is then computed by numerical Green’s functions. The results presented here do validate the numerical computation method, which gave distant motions in close relation with the experimental data, from a qualitative and quantitative point of view. The spectral analysis does also exhibit surface waves trapped in the topmost layer. Results confirm the significant contamination of ground motion due to building vibration...|$|R
