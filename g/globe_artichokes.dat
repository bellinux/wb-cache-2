40|$|<b>Globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> (Cynara cardunculus var. scolymus L., Asteraceae) is a {{perennial}} crop traditionally consumed as a vegetable in the Mediterranean countries and rich in nutraceutically and pharmaceutically active compounds, including phenolic and terpenoid compounds. Its bitter taste {{is caused by}} its high content of sesquiterpene lactones (STLs), such as cynaropicrin. The biosynthetic pathway responsible for STL biosynthesis in <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> is unknown, but likely proceeds through germacrene A, {{as has been shown}} for other Asteraceae species. Here, we investigated the accumulation of cynaropicrin in different tissues of <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke,</b> and compared it to accumulation of phenolic compounds.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{leaves of}} <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> and {{cultivated}} cardoon (Cynara cardunculus L.) have significant pharmaceutical properties, which mainly result from their high content of polyphenolic compounds such as monocaffeoylquinic and dicaffeoylquinic acid (DCQ), {{and a range}} of flavonoid compounds. Results Hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HQT) encoding genes have been isolated from both <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> and cultivated cardoon (GenBank accessions DQ 915589 and DQ 915590, respectively) using CODEHOP and PCR-RACE. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that their sequences belong to one of the major acyltransferase groups (anthranilate N-hydroxycinnamoyl/benzoyltransferase). The heterologous expression of <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> HQT in E. coli showed that this enzyme can catalyze the esterification of quinic acid with caffeoyl-CoA or p -coumaroyl-CoA to generate, respectively, chlorogenic acid (CGA) and p -coumaroyl quinate. Real time PCR experiments demonstrated an increase in the expression level of HQT in UV-C treated leaves, and established a correlation between the synthesis of phenolic acids and protection against damage due to abiotic stress. The HQT gene, together with a gene encoding hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT) previously isolated from <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke,</b> have been incorporated within the developing <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> linkage maps.

In order to accommodate for the intended European uses on quinces, several root crops, bulb vegetables, cucurbits (inedible peel), witloof chicory, <b>globe</b> <b>artichokes,</b> rice and chicory roots and to accommodate the authorized use in Brazil on papaya, the EMS proposed to raise the existing MRLs for difenoconazole in all these crops. The EMS drafted an evaluation report according to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals for all the crops considered. The applicant has not submitted data on TDM residues in the crops under consideration. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the intended use of difenoconazole on the crops under consideration will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values for difenoconazole and therefore is unlikely to pose a public health concern. The consumer risk assessment regarding the TDMs was not undertaken in the framework of the current application and has to be performed as soon as the confirmatory data for triazole pesticides are available and a suitable risk assessment methodology has been developed, taking into account the contribution of the TDMs present in primary crops, rotational crops, processed commodities and products of animal origin resulting from different triazole pesticides...|$|E

40|$|Leaf {{extracts}} from <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> (Cynara cardunculus L. var. scolymus) {{have been widely}} used in medicine as hepatoprotectant and choleretic agents. <b>Globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> leaves represent a natural source of phenolic acids with dicaffeoylquinic acids, such as cynarin (1, 3 -dicaffeoylquinic acid), along with its biosynthetic precursor chlorogenic acid (5 -caffeoylquinic acid) as the most abundant molecules. This paper reports the development of an experimental system to induce caffeoylquinic acids. This system may serve to study the regulation of the biosynthesis of (poly) phenolic compounds in <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> and the genetic basis of this metabolic regulation. By means of HPLC-PDA and accurate mass LC-QTOF MS and MS/MS analyses, the major phenolic compounds in <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> leaves were identified: four isomers of dicaffeoylquinic acid, three isomers of caffeoylquinic acid, and the flavone luteolin 7 -glucoside. Next, plant material was identified in which the concentration of phenolic compounds was comparable in the absence of particular treatments, with the aim to use this material to test the effect of stress application on the regulation of biosynthesis of caffeoylquinic acids. Using this material, the effect of UV-C, methyl jasmonate, and salicylic acid treatments on (poly) phenolic compounds was tested in different <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> genotypes. UV-C exposure consistently increased the levels of dicaffeoylquinic acids in all genotypes, whereas the effect on compounds from the same biosynthetic pathway, for example, chlorogenic acid and luteolin- 7 -glucoside, was much less pronounced and was not statistically significant. No effect of methyl jasmonate or salicylic acid was found. Time-response experiments indicated that the level of dicaffeoylquinic acids reached a maximum at 24 h after UV radiation.

40|$|The globe {{artichoke}} (Cynara cardunculus L. var. scolymus (L.) Fiori (=C. scolymus L.)) (diploid, 2 n = 34) {{is the most}} important botanical variety of the species, which also includes C. cardunculus L. var. altilis DC. (=C. cardunculus L. var. cardunculus), the cultivated cardoon, and C. cardunculus L. var. sylvestris (Lamk) Fiori, which comprises wild relatives. The genus Cynara, native of the Mediterranean Basin, belongs to the botanical family Asteraceae (=Compositae) and includes seven species besides C. cardunculus. It is widely accepted that C. cardunculus var. sylvestris is the ancestor of the other two varieties (55, 120). Artichoke is an allogamous species that is mainly propagated vegetatively via “stumps” (basal stem pieces with attached root sections) or “ovoli” (axillary buds separated from the stumps), although a few cultivars are seed-propagated (101). More than 120, 000 ha of <b>globe</b> <b>artichokes</b> are cultivated in more than 25 countries worldwide that yield approximately 1, 300, 000 t of buds. This hectarage represents 2. 5 % of the world area cultivated to vegetables (51). Italy is the leading artichoke-producing country with more than 35 % of world production. Spain ranks second with 19 % of world production despite a 20 % hectarage reduction during the last 5 years. Similar reductions of the cultivated area and production of artichokes have occurred in France, the United States, and, less markedly, in Greece (Table 1). Conversely, the crop hectarage has expanded greatly in other countries: over a 30 -fold increase in Peru, twofold increase in China and Turkey, about 60 % increase in Chile and Egypt, and nearly 20 % increase in Algeria, Argentina, and Morocco. Additionally, the yield per cultivated area in countries such as Algeria, China, Morocco, Peru, and Turkey has recently achieved a level comparable with that of other countries. This may be a consequence of significant improvements in artichoke cultivation technology in those countries, where artichoke plantations have been established more recently than elsewhere. An overview of world production of artichokes was published recently (80). Verticillium wilt, caused by the soilborne fungus Verticillium dahliae Kleb., {{is one of the main}} constraints for artichoke production worldwide. This disease was first reported on artichoke in Italy in the late 1920 s (42, 95). Subsequently, new reports were published from France (27), again in Italy (25, 32, 36), Spain (112), Chile (52), Greece (114), California (17), and Tunisia (67). Currently, Verticillium wilt occurs in all artichoke-growing areas. Verticillium wilt is becoming an increasing concern in artichoke production because the rapid spread of the disease to new growing areas has led to declining production. For example, in the 1980 s, the disease was found affecting artichoke crops in several Italian regions such as Apulia, Campania, Lazio, Sardinia, Sicily, and Tuscany. In Apulia, which {{is the most important}} Italian area of artichoke production, problems with Verticillium wilt led to a reduction in the area cultivated to artichoke in the Bari Province, and also extended rapidly to new plantations that had been established in the provinces of Brindisi, Foggia, and Lecce (2, 33). A similar decrease in artichoke cultivation due to Verticillium wilt was observed in Chile (52, 53). In Spain, Armengol et al. (3) underlined the spread of Verticillium wilt in the Comunidad Valenciana region in eastern-central Spain, the main artichoke-growing area in the country. They reported over 80 % disease prevalence in fields of stump- and seed-propagated artichokes sampled during 1999 to 2002, with an average wilt incidence of 53. 8 %...|$|E

Classic Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) on slide, using repetitive telomeric and ribosomal sequences and Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) oligonucleotide as probes, identified homologous chromosome relationships and allowed development of molecular karyotypes for both varieties. The close phylogenetic relationship between <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> and cardoon {{was supported by the}} very similar karyotypes but clear chromosomal structural variation was detected. In the light of the recent release of the <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> genome sequencing, these results are relevant for future anchoring of the pseudomolecule sequence assemblies to specific chromosomes. In addition, the DNA content of the two crops has been determined by flow cytometry and a fast method for standard FISH on slide and methodological improvements for nuclei isolation are described...|$|R
40|$|<b>Globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> {{leaves are}} highly rich in {{phenolic}} acids, in particular chlorogenic acid and dicaffeoylquinic acids. The latter {{are of particular}} interest since they can exert a stronger antioxidant activity, due {{to the presence of}} two adjacent hydroxyl groups on each of their phenolic rings. Plant tissue and cell cultures have been widely exploited for the production of secondary metabolites. We compared the content of 5 -O-caffeoylquinic acid (chlorogenic acid) and 1, 5 -O-dicaffeoylquinic acid in leaf tissues and calli obtained from leaf explants of two <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> genotypes (SAROM and C 3 -RR) belonging to the varietal type ‘Romanesco’. HPLC analyses highlighted that chlorogenic acid accumulates preferentially in leaf tissue, while dicaffeoyquinic acid in calli. We previously set up a system, based on UV-C exposure of leaf foliar discs, which was found to induce dicaffeoylquinic acid synthesis. Preliminary results demonstrate that UV-C further increases the content of dicaffeoylquinic acid of 1. 5 -fold also when applied to callus tissue. <b>Globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> callus culture combined with UV-C radiation may thus represent a promising system for the production of dicaffeoylquinic acids...|$|R
40|$|In Italy, <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> {{production}} is prevailingly {{concentrated in the}} South and islands, where it provides {{an important contribution to}} the agricultural economy. In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in this crop as a promising source of polyphenols, a heterogeneous class of secondary metabolites characterized by various healthy properties well-documented in literature. The phenolic fraction, present in the different artichoke plant parts, varies widely in relation to biotic and abiotic factors. Therefore, the present study aimed at evaluating the variation of phenolic content in <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> in relation to biological, technical and environmental factors. Two field-experiments were carried out in Sicily (South Italy) in two representative cultivation areas, in order {{to examine the effects of}} genotype, head fraction, season conditions, planting density and arrangement on the <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> phenolic concentration. Both the total polyphenols and the individual phenolic compounds detected were notably genotype- dependent. Particularly, the high level of caffeoylquinic acids (chlorogenic acid, among others) and apigenin 7 - O-glucuronide, reported respectively by &ldquo;Violetto di Sicilia&rdquo; and &ldquo;Romanesco clone C 3 &rdquo;, could be used to encourage <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> fresh consumption. Total polyphenols content also resulted more abundant in specific accumulation sites within the inflorescence, such as the floral stem and receptacle, and for most of genotypes it decreased during the second year in response to the different meteorological conditions. Additionally, total polyphenols content significantly and linearly increased as plant density increased from 1. 0 to 1. 8 plant m- 2 and it significantly increased by 13 % passing from single to twin rows plant arrangement...|$|R
40|$|The paper aims at {{evaluating}} the potential biogas production, {{both in terms}} of CH 4 and theoretical energy potential, from <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> agricultural byproducts in Sardinia. Field data about the productivity of byproducts were collected on five artichoke varieties cultivated in Sardinia, to assess the biomethane production of their aboveground non-food parts (excluding the head). Moreover, secondary data from previous studies and surveys at regional scale were collected to evaluate the potential biogas production of the different districts. Fresh <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> residues yielded, on average, 292. 2 Nm 3 ·tDOM− 1, with dissimilarities among cultivars. Fresh samples were analyzed in two series: (a) wet basis; and (b) wet basis with catalytic enzymes application. Enzymes proved to have some beneficial effects in terms of anticipated biomethane availability. At the regional level, ab. 20 × 106 Nm 3 CH 4 could be produced, corresponding to the 60 % of current installed capacity. However, districts potentials show some differences, depending on the specific biomass partitioning and on the productivity of cultivated varieties. Regional assessments should encompass the sensitiveness of results to agro-economic variables and the economic impacts of <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> residue use in the current regional biogas sector...|$|R
40|$|Aseptically, shoot bud and {{undifferentiated}} {{cultures of}} <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> were successfully stored for 12 months at 5 ºC in the dark. Under these conditions, {{high percentage of}} cultures remained viable without perceptable serious signs of senenscence. Although the rates of regrowth slightly decreased, the recovery percentages were enough to obtain high frequencies of healthy <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> (= Cynara scolymus L.). The storage at cold and dark conditions was strongly effective compared with storage in the medium under osmotic stress. Also, the differentiated cultures registered a higher viability compared to undifferentiated cultures. RAPD analysis suggests that plantlets derived from the preserved cultures were identical to those derived from nonstored differentiated tissues culrtures. However, undifferentiated (callus) cultures showed relatively less genetic variation...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} explore {{complementary}} biomass sources, field studies {{were conducted on}} Cynara cardunculus botanical varieties (<b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> and cultivated cardoon) for energy purposes. In addition, the potential of milk thistle (Silybum marianum L. Gaertn.) as a suitable energy crop for Southern Europe countries was investigated. The three different crops were compared over three years (2007 – 2010) in a Mediterranean environment (Sardinia, Southern Italy) for quantitative and qualitative (calorific value, ultimate and proximate analyses, ash composition) biomass characteristics. Annual biomass production across years averaged about 10, 4, and 16 Mg ha − 1 in cardoon, <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> and milk thistle, respectively. The chemical analysis of biomass showed a similar composition among crops with a mean ash content of 14...|$|R
