A visible manifestation of such aging in place is the naturally occurring retirement community (NORC) —a neighborhood not planned or intended for older people but where adults stay on and grown old while younger ones drift away. NORCs arise from a distinctive conjunction of demographic forces operating over time: initial cohorts settle in close proximity and collectively advance in age while subsequent, less settled cohorts depart. We illustrate the use of Census 2000 data for spotting and delineating incipient NORCs. We elaborate on their significance as potential target markets, both for community planners interested in centralizing service delivery to the elderly and for businesses offering types of services that can be bundled most profitably for these residential concentrations of elderly...|$|R

30|$|In the {{contemporary}} world of mega-cities, {{more and more people}} perceive city oligarchs—lobby-controlled political representatives that Florida (2002) praised as if they really were a “creative class”—as a delegitimized if not utterly illegal power that has occupied the once-democratic grassroots institutions. People do not identify in a social class nor do they form a political mass that aggregates on a geographical basis. Indifferently they group according to lifestyles, occupations, ethnicity, religion, income and more. All these spontaneous and, to a large extent, unaware communities neither have a political status nor assume they should strive for it (Poli 2015, part 2). Most of {{the contemporary}} political values and institutions are based on the firm assumption that nothing is authorized to exist outside the legitimate society and its governments. A comprehensive society was the goal of the modernization process that, step by step, reduced the tolerance for the plurality of legal systems and for ethnic and religious diversities. Therefore, the existing city governments do not recognize the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>communities</b> in the urban sprawl and—what is even worse—communities themselves think they have no right or chance to be acknowledged (incorporated) in the current setting. In as much as inhabitants feel anonymous in the metropolises, they either grow a strong sense of belonging to smaller illegal and apparently oppressed communities, or become uninterested in any civic involvement. The lack of representation of geographical metropolitan communities is latent because the metropolitan system works fairly well most of the time. Or, to put it better, citizens are not yet completely aware of possible alternatives to contemporary urban settlement and design that communication technologies have made available long since. Therefore, they see a solution to the usual troubles in standard infrastructures and call for short-term responses.|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: FamAnn is an {{automated}} variant annotation pipeline designed for facilitating target discovery for family-based sequencing studies. It can apply a different inheritance pattern or a de novo mutations discovery model to each family and select single nucleotide variants and small insertions and deletions segregating in each family or shared by multiple families. It {{also provides a}} variety of variant annotations and retains and annotates all transcripts hit by a single variant. Excel-compatible outputs including all annotated variants segregating in each family or shared by multiple families will be provided for users to prioritize variants based on their customized thresholds. A list of genes that harbor the segregating variants will be provided as well for possible pathway/network analyses. FamAnn uses the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>community</b> standard Variant Call Format as the input format and {{can be applied to}} whole exome, genome or targeted resequencing data.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the constraints, adaptations and {{innovations}} in the livelihoods of Orma pastoralists. The fieldwork took place with families around Tiltila, Waldena and Kalalani {{over a period of}} 9 months in 2007 / 08. The position of pastoralist peoples in East Africa is characterised by social, political and economic marginalisation, weak land tenure, and declining per capita livestock holdings, while their shrinking grazing lands are widely regarded to be on the front line of climate change, both in terms of climate impacts and biofuel/agribusiness land pressure. The dearth of good quality data on pastoralist populations and livelihoods is widely cited as one of the fundamental barriers to improving the effectiveness of development support in the drylands. This study seeks to address these knowledge gaps for Orma pastoralists, while contributing to the body of theory on pastoralist livelihood dynamics. Data on the effects of wealth, education and food aid on household mobility were analysed using a theory of asset threshold dynamics. An adapted typology of livelihood strategies was developed to interpret and structure the data. Using child mortality as a proxy for respondent health, the impacts of wealth and mobility status on families’ health were explored. In the context of an almost total lack of data on community redistribution of food aid, both for the Orma and for East African pastoralists more generally, the study provides empirical data on <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>community</b> food aid allocation patterns. The study also examines a controversial large-scale expropriation of land in Tana River (subsidised under the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism) which will undermine the capacity of Orma pastoralists and other minority groups, to adapt to increased and more extreme environmental variability. In an environment in which enrolment in formal education is very low (particularly for girls), the study found that community nursery schools represent a relatively recent (and thus far undocumented) innovation organised and funded by groups of parents. The data demonstrates unprecedented levels of female enrolment despite cost constraints faced by least wealthy families. It is therefore suggested that incorporation of the community nursery model into the basic literacy element of the proposed national distance learning strategy, offers significant potential for addressing ‘Education For All’ in Kenya’s drylands.

40|$|<b>De</b> <b>facto</b> states, {{defined as}} {{entities}} that possess {{control over a}} defined territory, population, and government, but without recognition from other states, have become increasingly important {{over the past three}} decades. Although the universe of cases is small (there have been 24 <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states since the 1960 s), <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states {{play an important role in}} regional security and stability. Despite this relevance, we still know little about why <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states emerge, how their preferences are formed, and what shapes their behaviour and decision-making. Shedding light on these overlooked issues will allow us to better understand the role of <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states in regional and international politics. The existing literature, although insightful, does not fully explain the behaviour of <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states. In particular, the literature has fallen short in explaining the behaviour of Iraqi Kurdistan. In order to better understand the behaviour of <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states, this thesis asks the following questions: what are the factors that shape and influence <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state preferences and behaviour? What are the factors that determine if a <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state will declare independence or preserve the status quo? More specifically, in terms of the cases under examination, why did Kosovo and South Sudan declare independence, while Iraqi Kurdistan has not? The goal of this dissertation is to identify the conditions under which a <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state may declare independence and when it may preserve the status quo. To address these questions, this thesis employs international relations theories and adopts a comparative analysis method to the behaviour of Kosovo, South Sudan, and Iraqi Kurdistan. Following extensive fieldwork in Iraqi Kurdistan, the thesis argues that <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states will forgo independence when the parent state furnishes the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state with autonomy and offers sufficient economic incentives. Other mitigating factors include the domestic environment of the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state and the parent state, the role of regional and international governments, and the presence or absence of the old regime of the parent state. The main point is that the preference for independence is neither fixed nor inevitable...|$|R
40|$|This article {{challenges}} {{the concept of}} <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> (by fact) statelessness, often conceptualised as ineffective citizenship, from being included within the statelessness discourse.
