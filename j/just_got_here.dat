500|$|The Buccaneers overcame a shaky {{start in}} which they were penalized for 80 yards in the first quarter. Then, later, they had to {{overcome}} a fourth-quarter collapse {{in which they}} allowed the Colts to score 9 points that sent the Buccaneers into their first overtime game. Doug Williams' first pass of the day was intercepted by Norman Thompson, but it took the Colts, hampered by the loss of quarterback Bert Jones and running back Joe Washington, 9 plays to get to the end zone from the Buccaneers' 23-yard line. Lee Roy Selmon blocked an extra-point attempt in the fourth quarter that preserved the tie and led to the overtime period. The Buccaneers' ten sacks of Colts quarterback Greg Landry set a new team record. After Randy Crowder stripped the ball from Landry 1:31 into the overtime period, Neil O'Donoghue was immediately sent in to kick the game-winning 31-yard field goal. McKay pointed to the now-stable lineup as a factor in the team's improvement, saying that previously, you couldn't call an audible because [...] "one of the guys <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> Tuesday".|$|E

They're good American people like that, well-traveled and nice folks. But books--Lord! they can't talk about books no more than a Jersey City bartender.

And I'd be glad to take you down to Lesterhampton--there's a real old-fashioned inn down there, they say, where Paul Revere stayed one time; they say you can get the best kind of fried chicken and corn on cob and real old-fashioned New England blueberry pie.

His first action of the season as a 49er was noted by author Tom Danyluk as [...] "the greatest set of downs I have ever seen unleashed by a pass rusher".

The silver fox tells him all the others plan on busting out at nine oclock, and then asks if hes with them. Laughing at the prospect, the painted fox tells him he <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> and happily proclaims he wants to stay. The silver fox finds his words ridiculous, telling him that theyre all busting out of there or hes a dead man (implying the last part by running his finger across his throat). The painted fox misinterprets this yet again, believing the silver fox will kill him if he doesnt comply with their plan. Nervous and looking for an excuse to stay, he then states that the door is locked and theres no way out. Biting {{down hard on the}} nail file he had in his hand, the silver fox makes a perfect replica of the cell key they need. He then restates the hour they plan to escape.|$|E

When my buddies asked me who I got the nice package from, I {{explained}} all about the Service Club and all that you’re doing to make us feel closer to home. They were amazed to hear about the fine things that you are accomplishing for Bryant alumni in the Service. Many of my Army friends are college and university graduates, but none have a group back at their alma mater that’s doing anything like the wonderful thing that you’re doing for us Bryant graduates. We appreciate, sincerely, all that you’re doing for us. It’s not so much what you send us, but the thought that you have us in mind even though we’re so far away.

Last night I took some of the damndest [sic] test for 3 hours. There were questions where I was given for words, and I was to choose the one that was most unpleasant. One was, prostitute, whore, streetwalker, and v-girl! I don’t know, maybe I’m nuts. Then there were clock faces from which I had to tell the time. Clocks with the twelve at the bottom, the numerals running counterclockwise and upside down. And if the numerals were outside the minute marks, you had to use the large hand as the hour hand, and the hour hand as the minute hand. Whew, what a workout! They were given to us to help determine better standards on the classification tests of future cadets. They will not affect my standing in any way whatsoever. No, hon, I don’t fly here, but will be moving off to primary soon. I’ll be through classes in 9 days, and will probably ship between the 18 th + 20 th! Where did the time go?
