50|$|Another {{instrument}} {{used in a}} big way was the bank receipt (BR). In a ready <b>forward</b> <b>deal,</b> securities were not moved back and forth in actuality. Instead, the borrower, i.e. the seller of securities, gave the buyer of the securities a BR. The BR confirms the sale of securities. It acts as a receipt for the money received by the selling bank. Hence the name - bank receipt. It promises to deliver the securities to the buyer. It also states that in the mean time, the seller holds the securities in trust of the buyer.|$|E
5000|$|The crucial {{mechanism}} {{through which}} the scam was effected was the ready forward (RF) deal. The RF is in essence a secured short-term (typically 15-day) loan from one bank to another. Crudely put, the bank lends against government securities just as a pawnbroker lends against jewellery. The borrowing bank actually sells the securities to the lending bank and buys them back {{at the end of}} the period of the loan, typically at a slightly higher price. It was this ready <b>forward</b> <b>deal</b> that Mehta and his accomplices used with great success to channel money from the banking system. Sucheta Dalal, The Times of India , ...|$|E
50|$|A typical ready <b>forward</b> <b>deal</b> {{involved}} two banks {{brought together}} by a broker {{in lieu of a}} commission. The broker handles neither the cash nor the securities, though that wasn't the case in the lead-up to the scam. In this settlement process, deliveries of securities and payments were made through the broker. That is, the seller handed over the securities to the broker, who passed them to the buyer, while the buyer gave the cheque to the broker, who then made the payment to the seller. In this settlement process, the buyer and the seller might not even know whom they had traded with, either being known only to the broker. This the brokers could manage primarily because by now they had become market makers and had started trading on their account. To keep up a semblance of legality, they pretended to be undertaking the transactions on behalf of a bank.|$|E

Likewise, discrepancies existing between the authors approaches are put <b>forward,</b> <b>dealing</b> : with the barrier to be overcome by electrons at low and high field strengths; and with the notion of transition field from one regime to the other. The account concerns essentially Coulomb potentials, though the case of more steeper wells is also evoked.
