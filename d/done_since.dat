5|$|Beginning in 2005, Global Heritage Fund (GHF), in {{partnership}} with Tsinghua University (Beijing), has been working to conserve the cultural heritage of Foguang Temple's Great East Hall. The hall has not had any restoration work <b>done</b> <b>since</b> the 17th century, and suffers from water damage and rotting beams. Despite the temple undergoing restoration, it is still open to the public. On June 26, 2009, the temple was inscribed {{as part of the}} Mount Wutai UNESCO World Heritage Site.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Pratt & Whitney studied {{retrofitting}} B-52s {{with four}} Pratt & Whitney PW2000 (F117) engines, {{but this was}} not <b>done,</b> <b>since</b> all B-52s were to be replaced by B-1s and B-2s by the late 1990s. In 1996 Rolls-Royce and Boeing jointly proposed to fit B-52s with four leased Rolls-Royce RB211-535 engines, but this plan failed because of Air Force resistance to leasing combat assets and a negative Air Force economic analysis which was later disputed as flawed.|$|E
5|$|Paper Trail is {{the sixth}} studio album by American hip hop {{recording}} artist T.I., released September 30, 2008, on Grand Hustle Records and Atlantic Records.

Unlike his past albums, he wrote his lyrics down on paper, which he had not <b>done</b> <b>since</b> his debut album, I'm Serious (2001).|$|E

5|$|Since its inception, {{hundreds}} of millions of dollars have been poured into the Auburn Dam project, but no further work has been <b>done</b> <b>since</b> the 1980s. However, the Bureau of Reclamation continues to list the Auburn as a considered alternative for the future of its Auburn-Folsom South Unit project. As of now, massive evidence of the dam's construction still remain in the North Fork American River canyon, specifically the excavations for the abutments and spillway, with the consequences of increased erosion.|$|E
5|$|A 1947 {{newspaper}} article {{estimated that the}} new park would have 50,000visitors that year, and detailed the work the state had <b>done</b> <b>since</b> acquiring the land. The Falls Trail through the glens was rebuilt, all the stone steps were replaced, and signs were added. Out of concern for greater safety, footbridges with handrails replaced those made from hewn logs, overhanging rock ledges were removed in places, and the trail was rerouted near some falls. In {{the southern end of}} the new park, the state built the Evergreen Trail past Adams Falls, as well as a new parking area for 200cars and a concession stand, both along Pennsylvania Route 118 (PA 118).|$|E
5|$|Although {{the crisis}} of the 3rd century was not the {{absolute}} beginning of Rome's decline, it nevertheless did impose a severe strain on the empire as Romans waged war on one another as they had not <b>done</b> <b>since</b> {{the last days of the}} Republic. Within the space of a single century, twenty-seven military officers declared themselves emperors and reigned over parts of the empire for months or days, all but two meeting with a violent end. The time was characterized by a Roman army that was as likely to be attacking itself as it was an outside invader, reaching a low point around 258 AD. Ironically, while it was these usurpations that led to the breakup of the Empire during the crisis, it was the strength of several frontier generals that helped reunify the empire through force of arms.|$|E

5|$|In June 2010, the Ministry of Justice {{announced}} plans to close 54 county courts and 103 magistrates' courts in England and Wales, {{in order to save}} £15m in annual running costs and £22m in necessary maintenance. The courts threatened with closure in Wales were Aberdare, Llangefni, Pontypool and Rhyl. In addition, it was proposed that Newport County Court would no longer hold hearings at Chepstow every fortnight (as had been <b>done</b> <b>since</b> the county court there closed in 2002). After consultation, it was decided to keep Llangefni County Court open, but the other closures were confirmed.|$|E
5|$|An {{earthquake}} in 1302 caused damage to al-Azhar {{and a number}} of other mosques throughout Mamluk territory. The responsibility for reconstruction was split among the amirs (princes) of the Sultanate and the head of the army, Amir Salar, who was tasked with repairing the damage. These repairs were the first <b>done</b> <b>since</b> the reign of Baibars. Seven years later a dedicated school, the Madrasa al-Aqbaghawiyya, was built along the northwest wall of the mosque. Portions of the wall of the mosque were removed to accommodate the new building. Construction of another school, the Madrasa al-Taybarsiyya began in 1332–1333. This building, which was completed in 1339-1340, would also impact the structure of the mosque as it was built over the site of the mida'a, the fountain for ablution. Both of the madrasas were built as complementary buildings to al-Azhar, with separate entrances and prayer halls.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of release}} schedules—especially {{in the case}} of films {{released}} {{towards the end of the}} year—and different release patterns across the world, many films can do business in two or more calendar years; therefore the grosses documented here are not confined to just the year of release. Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has <b>done</b> <b>since</b> its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained. At least one film every year has generated $100 million in gross revenue at the box office since 1967, and from 2008 each year has succeeded in producing a billion dollar grossing film.|$|E

5|$|Despite these {{assurances that}} change would be forthcoming, Holmlund came under {{considerable}} pressure from {{some members of}} parliament, particularly those in the Left Alliance, to resign for not acting sooner. Leading the call for her deposition was Anneli Lapintie; Tarja Filatov, parliamentary group {{leader of the opposition}} Social Democratic Party of Finland (SDP) also questioned the government over what it had <b>done</b> <b>since</b> the Jokela incident. Vanhanen launched a defence of the government by saying that iniquiries were ongoing, even into the Jokela case. A survey by pollster Taloustutkimus for YLE showed that dissension towards Holmlund was not widespread: only a quarter of members from smaller parties felt she should step down, only 10% of SDP members (with 80% supporting her to stay on), and 90% of the government's partners wanted her to hold onto her ministry. Amongst the population, 82% felt she should continue.|$|E
5|$|In 1942 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania bought 1,261acres (510ha), {{including}} the glens and their waterfalls, from the heirs for $82,000. Ricketts Glen State Park opened in 1944. The state bought {{a total of}} 16,000acres (6,500ha) more from the heirs in 1945 and 1950 for $68,000; the park today has about 10,000acres (4,000ha) from the Ricketts family and about 3,000acres (1,200ha) acquired from others. A 1947 newspaper article estimated that the new park would have 50,000visitors that year, and detailed the work the state had <b>done</b> <b>since</b> acquiring the land. The Falls Trail through the glens was rebuilt, all the stone steps were replaced, and signs were added. Out of concern for greater safety, footbridges with handrails replaced those made from hewn logs, overhanging rock ledges were removed in places, and the trail was rerouted near some falls. The Evergreen Trail past Adams Falls was built at this time.|$|E
5|$|The {{reign of}} Djedkare Isesi heralded a new {{period in the}} history of the Old Kingdom. First, Djedkare Isesi did not build a sun temple, as his {{predecessors}} had <b>done</b> <b>since</b> the time of Userkaf, some 80 years earlier. This may be a result of the increased prominence of Osiris compared with the sun god Ra during the late Fifth Dynasty. The importance of this cult becomes manifest when the Pyramid Texts of the pyramid of Unas are inscribed a few decades later. In this context, it is perhaps noteworthy that the only known statue of Djedkare Isesi was discovered in the ruins of the temple of Osiris, in Abydos. Another manifestation of the winds of change during Djedkare's time on throne is the confirmation of the relocation of the royal necropolis from Abusir, where it had been since the reign of Sahure, to Saqqara, where Menkauhor Kaiu, Djedkare and his successor, Unas, built their pyramids. Abusir may have become overcrowded by the time of Menkauhor's accession and the capital may have been shifted south to Saqqara along with the royal necropolis around the same time. The abandonment of Abusir as a royal necropolis and the termination of sun temple building are possibly related given the close association between the two since the reign of Userkaf.|$|E
