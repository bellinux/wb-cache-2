40|$|By using {{analytical}} correlations derived as {{a result}} of theoretical research, a computer algorithm has been worked out for simulating the functions of the plough body and the forces exerted by soil upon the operating parts, as well as its <b>draft</b> <b>resistance.</b> These correlations allow to determine the <b>draft</b> <b>resistance</b> of the plough depending on the parameters of its body, as well as to evaluate the impact of the physical and mechanical properties of soil, such as friction upon it. The greatest influence upon the <b>draft</b> <b>resistance</b> is exerted by soil hardness, density and slip resistance along the surfaces of the operating parts. The latter is also affected by soil adhesion, which particularly manifests itself in wet clay soils at lower temperatures. It has been clarified that the friction resistance constitutes 46 – 62 % of the total <b>draft</b> <b>resistance</b> of the plough body. The main ways of lowering the friction resistance and the total <b>draft</b> <b>resistance</b> of the plough are the introduction of a more rational design of its body having optimum parameters, decreasing the resistance of the share-mouldboard surface and the values of reactions of the supporting surfaces, as well as the application of antifriction materials and better modes of joining with tractors...|$|R

40|$|Summary. The main {{parameters}} of a plough body that determine the ploughing efficiency are the initial and final soil strip lifting angles on the share-mouldboard surface, the angles of its horizon-tal generatrix, the radius of this {{surface and the}} working width of the body. By using analytical correlations derived {{as a result of}} theoretical research, a computer algorithm has been worked out for simulating the functions of the plough body and the forces exerted by soil upon the operating parts, as well as its <b>draft</b> <b>resistance</b> depending on the share inclination angle, determining the initial lifting angle. By increasing it, the <b>draft</b> <b>resistance</b> increases. For economical ploughing its opti-mum vary 28 °… 32 °.

40|$|This paper employs {{social theory}} and {{empirical}} observation, juxtaposing Israel as a 'racial state' (Goldberg, 2002) {{and the concept}} of femina sacra, a female version of Agamben's homo sacer or 'bare life' (Agamben, 1998), to think about some aspects of Israeli feminist peace activism since the onset of the second Intifada. Although Israeli feminist peace activism seems to discursively vacillate between essentialist motherhood narratives and subversive <b>draft</b> <b>resistance</b> practices, reading <b>draft</b> <b>resistance</b> narratives of young Israeli women conscripts, the paper tentatively suggests that where the state positions itself above morality, while evoking morality in its defence, feminist 'peace activism' in Israel/Palestine, though providing a potent counter-narrative to the Zionist narration of nation, does not destabilise the racial state, which is apparently gradually destroying itself while wilfully destroying its Others. I conclude by asking whether morally positioning itself in contrast to the racial state, such resistance can be theorised as gendered.

American Communists also opposed the war until Germany attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941, whereupon they became supporters.|$|R

40|$|The {{movements}} {{against the}} Vietnam and Iraq wars {{gave rise to}} analogous resistance efforts, {{in the form of}} <b>draft</b> <b>resistance</b> and counter-recruitment, respectively. Despite their many similarities, the <b>draft</b> <b>resistance</b> and counter-recruitment movements emerged in distinct historical eras marked by very different ‘state imaginaries’ or assumptions {{about the nature of the}} state and people’s relation to it. Drawing on original archival work, this paper excavates these state imaginaries and examines how they conditioned activists’ subjectivities in each era. More specifically, this paper argues that the 1960 s were marked by an imaginary of the state based on consent, which positioned draft resisters as complicit citizens and engendered a sense of personal responsibility for the war. This state imaginary was displaced in the neoliberal era by an imaginary of the state as an alien and invasive force, which positioned counter-recruitment activists (or their children) as potential prey and impelled efforts at self-defense...|$|R
