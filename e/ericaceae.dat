5|$|A mutualistic {{association}} {{similar to}} ectomycorrhiza {{but with some}} hyphae penetrating into the plant root cells, termed arbutoid mycorrhiza, is formed by Russulaceae with shrubs of the genera Arbutus and Arctostaphylos, both in subfamily Arbutoideae of the <b>Ericaceae.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some Russulaceae are {{associated}} with myco-heterotrophic plants of the <b>Ericaceae</b> subfamily Monotropoideae, forming monotropoid mycorrhiza. This is an epiparasitic relationship, where the heterotrophic plant ultimately derives its carbon from the primary, ectomycorrhizal plant partner of the fungus. The association is often very specific, with the heterotrophic plants only associating with selected fungus partners, including Russulaceae.|$|E
5|$|Coccomyces dentatus is a {{saprobic}} species, {{and grows}} on dead leaves {{of a wide}} variety of angiosperms. It is frequently encountered on members of the heather (family <b>Ericaceae),</b> and the beech family (Fagaceae), such as oak (red, white, and live oak) and chestnut, and also on the exotic Castanea sativa from Chile. Other common substrates include leaves of trees in the genera Rhododendron, Lithocarpus, Berberis, Arbutus, Gaultheria, and Myrica.|$|E
5|$|Ciomadul {{is covered}} by beech and spruce forests. Around St. Ana lake, the {{vegetation}} is mostly formed by Fagus sylvatica (common beech) and Picea abies (Norway spruce) woods. Other trees include Acer platanoides (Norway maple), Betula pendula (silver birch), Carpinus betulus (common hornbeam), Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine), Salix caprea (goat willow) and Salix cinerea (grey willow). A fen contains Carex lasiocarpa (slender sedge), Carex rostrata (bottle sedge), Lysimachia thyrsiflora (tufted loosestrife) and Sphagnum angustifolium (fine bogmoss). At Mohos, vegetation consists of Alnus glutinosa (common alder), Betula pendula and Salix. The peat bog contains trees (Pinus sylvestris and Betula pubescens (downy birch)) and <b>Ericaceae.</b>|$|E
5|$|Thrips setipennis is {{the sole}} {{pollinator}} of Wilkiea huegeliana, a small, unisexual annually flowering tree or shrub in the rainforests of eastern Australia. T. setipennis serves as an obligate pollinator for other Australian rainforest plant species, including Myrsine howittiana and M. variabilis. The genus Cycadothrips is a specialist pollinator of cycads, the flowers of which are adapted for pollination by small insects. Thrips are likewise the primary pollinators of heathers in the family <b>Ericaceae,</b> and {{play a significant role}} in the pollination of pointleaf manzanita. Electron microscopy has shown thrips carrying pollen grains adhering to their backs, and their fringed wings are perfectly capable of allowing them to fly from plant to plant.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary {{molecular}} phylogenetics {{has clearly}} established the Monotropoideae {{as a group}} within the larger <b>Ericaceae,</b> though many {{of the details of}} relationships between the Monotropoideae {{and the rest of the}} <b>Ericaceae</b> are still (as of 2015) a topic of active research, particularly the question of whether or not the Pyroleae and the rest of the Monotropeae form a single monophyletic group.|$|E
25|$|The {{emerging}} shoots may be erect or nodding, with erect or pendulous flowers, {{which may}} become more erect as the plant matures. The flowers themselves, in common {{with other members of}} the <b>Ericaceae,</b> have corollas that are generally bell- or cup-shaped, though the petals themselves may or may not be fused. However, the Monotropoideae lack the poricidal anthers that are characteristic of the majority of the <b>Ericaceae.</b> (The Pyroleae do have poricidal anthers, however.) Pollen grains are released as a monad, in contrast to the majority of the <b>Ericaceae,</b> which release pollen grains in tetrad groups. (The Pyroleae variously release pollen as monads, tetrads, or polyads.) Fruits are dry loculicidal dehiscent (or sometimes indehiscent) capsule or a berry. Seeds are highly reduced dust seeds. The shoot may or may not be persistent after seed dispersal.|$|E
25|$|Other classifications have {{included}} Monotropoideae as a subfamily of Hypopityaceae, by August W. Eichler (1875), {{and as a}} subfamily of Pyrolaceae by Carl Georg Oscar Drude (1889); both classifications united the monotropes with the pyrolids in a single group. Over the next century, authors have variously treated this group as a distinct family or as a subfamily of the <b>Ericaceae,</b> though the trend from Margaret W. Henderson (1919) onward was toward the latter subfamily classification, albeit, the influential Cronquist and Dahlgren systems continued to treat the group as the family Monotropaceae, separate from the <b>Ericaceae.</b>|$|E
25|$|Monotropoideae, {{sometimes}} referred to as monotropes, are a flowering plant subfamily in the family <b>Ericaceae.</b> Members of this subfamily are notable for their mycoheterotrophic and non-photosynthesizing or achlorophyllous characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Stage of pine forests. The {{native species}} have {{practically}} disappeared, {{as has the}} associated vegetation. Together with the pines, heliophilic (preferring dry and sunny habitats) and invasive brush start to appear, almost always based on the families Cistaceae and <b>Ericaceae.</b>|$|E
25|$|This type of {{mycorrhiza}} {{occurs in}} the subfamily Monotropoideae of the <b>Ericaceae,</b> {{as well as several}} genera in the Orchidaceae. These plants are heterotrophic or mixotrophic and derive their carbon from the fungus partner. This is thus a non-mutualistic, parasitic type of mycorrhizal symbiosis.|$|E
25|$|This type of {{mycorrhiza}} involves {{plants of}} the <b>Ericaceae</b> subfamily Arbutoideae. It is however different from ericoid mycorrhiza and resembles ectomycorrhiza, both functionally {{and in terms}} of the fungi involved. The difference to ectomycorrhiza is that some hyphae actually penetrate into the root cells, making this type of mycorrhiza an ectendomycorrhiza.|$|E
25|$|Xerocomus subtomentosus {{occurs in}} autumn in forests {{throughout}} Eurasia, North America and Australia and forming a mycorrhizal {{relationship with a}} wide range of hardwood and conifer trees. It has been recorded from the vicinity of Tangier in Morocco, growing under cork oak (Quercus suber). It is associated with bilberry and other evergreen shrubs of the heath family <b>Ericaceae.</b>|$|E
25|$|Several mite species (mainly in the genera Proctolaelaps, Tropicoseius and Rhinoseius, family Ascidae) {{have evolved}} a phoretic mode of life, {{climbing}} into the nostrils of hummingbirds that visit flowers and hitching a ride to other flowers where they can feed on the nectar. Hummingbird flower mites favour plants in the families of Heliconiaceae, Costaceae, Zingiberaceae, Amaryllidaceae, Rubiaceae, Apocynaceae, Bromeliaceae, Gesneriaceae, Lobeliaceae and <b>Ericaceae,</b> members of which are associated with hummingbirds.|$|E
25|$|Mycoheterotrophic {{plants are}} {{plants that are}} unable to photosynthesize and instead rely on carbon {{transfer}} from mycorrhizal networks as their main source of energy. This group of plants includes about 400 species. Some families that include mycotrophic species are: <b>Ericaceae,</b> Orchidaceae, Monotropaceae, and Gentianaceae. In addition, partially mycoheterotrophic ('mixotrophic') plants also benefit from energy transfer via hyphal networks. These plants have fully developed leaves but usually live in very nutrient and light limited environments that restrict their ability to photosynthesize.|$|E

500|$|Epacris impressa, {{also known}} as common heath, is a plant of the heath family, <b>Ericaceae,</b> that is native to {{southeast}} Australia (the states of Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and New South Wales). French botanist Jacques Labillardière collected the species in 1793 and described it in 1805. Four forms have been identified, but no subspecies are recognised. Growing in heathland, shrubland or open forest, it is generally a small shrub around [...] tall, with small stiff leaves. The red, pink or white tube-like flowers appear from late autumn to early spring. Honeyeaters, particularly the eastern spinebill, feed upon the nectar of the flowers. It regenerates after bushfire by seed or by resprouting.|$|E
500|$|Montane scrub: Above [...] on only 1.5% of {{the surface}} area of the park, the last {{remaining}} mountain scrub in Madagascar can be found.

500|$|Accidental {{intoxication}} {{of humans}} by [...] mad honey {{has been well}} documented by several Classical authors, notably Xenophon, while the deliberate use of such honey as a medicine and intoxicant (even hallucinogen) is still practiced by the Gurung tribe of Nepal, who have a long tradition of hazardous cliff-climbing to wrest the precious commodity from the nests of Apis dorsata laboriosa, the giant Himalayan honeybee. The honey thus collected by the Gurung owes its inebriating properties to the nectar which the giant bees gather from a deep red-flowered species of Rhododendron, which, in turn, owes its toxicity to the compound grayanotoxin, widespread in the plant family <b>Ericaceae,</b> to which the genus Rhododendron belongs.|$|E
500|$|Lactarius deterrimus has {{traditionally}} been considered to have a strict mycorrhizal host specificity with Norway spruce. In 2006, {{it was reported that}} the fungus can also form arbutoid mycorrhiza with bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi). Arbutoid mycorrhizal associations are variants of ectomycorrhiza found in certain plants in the <b>Ericaceae</b> characterised by hyphal coils in epidermal cells. The mycorrhiza formed by L.deterrimus on both bearberry and Norway spruce show typical features such as a hyphal mantle and a Hartig net; the distinguishing characteristic between the mycorrhizal symbioses with the different hosts is that the hyphae penetrate the epidermal cells of bearberry, although there are also some differences {{in the form of the}} Hartig net, branching pattern, and colour. Although bearberry [...] has been shown to form mycorrhiza with a wide range of fungi both in the field and in laboratory experiments, it had never previously been known to form mycorrhiza with fungi thought to be strictly host-specific. Bearberry may function as a nurse plant to help re-establish Norway spruce in deforested areas.|$|E

2500|$|The monotropes {{were first}} {{described}} as a distinct plant family by Thomas Nuttall in 1818, when he united the Linnean genus Monotropa with his newly authored genus and species Pterospora andromedea as the family Monotropeae (changed by later authors to Monotropaceae when modern rules of naming plant taxa were developed). David Don {{was the first to}} recognize this group as a tribe within the <b>Ericaceae,</b> later raised to subfamily status as the Monotropoideae by Asa Gray in 1878. (However, George Arnott Walker-Arnott was the first to validly publish that name, as a subfamily of Monotropaceae, in 1832, hence, Arnott is cited as author of the name.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The overall {{morphology}} {{of these}} plants is highly reduced compared to {{other members of the}} <b>Ericaceae,</b> which are practically all subshrubs, shrubs, or trees. By contrast, the Monotropoideae are all herbaceous perennials, in which an annual shoot reemerges seasonally (in spring or early summer, depending on climate) from a perennial root. The shoot can be characterized as a single inflorescence or cluster of inflorescences, and is generally a raceme with one to many flowers per axis, though occasionally the raceme may be so reduced as to appear similar to a spike, and in Monotropa, the inflorescence can {{take the form of a}} solitary flower. Notably, the shoots are achlorophyllous, in keeping with the mycoheterotrophic and non-photosynthetic nature of the plant, and the plants have a striking and distinctive appearance, with coloration ranging from pure white to pastel tones to very bright yellow or red. (If the Pyroleae are included, many of these species are partially photosythentic, and have green vegetative tissue, though leaves are usually reduced to a basal rosette.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Arctic tundra {{contains}} {{areas of}} stark landscape and is frozen {{for much of}} the year. The soil there is frozen from [...] down, and it is impossible for trees to grow. Instead, bare and sometimes rocky land can only support low growing plants such as moss, heath (<b>Ericaceae</b> varieties such as crowberry and black bearberry), and lichen. There are two main seasons, winter and summer, in the polar tundra areas. During the winter it is very cold and dark, with the average temperature around , sometimes dipping as low as [...] However, extreme cold temperatures on the tundra do not drop as low as those experienced in taiga areas further south (for example, Russia's and Canada's lowest temperatures were recorded in locations south of the tree line). During the summer, temperatures rise somewhat, and the top layer of seasonally-frozen soil melts, leaving the ground very soggy. The tundra is covered in marshes, lakes, bogs and streams during the warm months. Generally daytime temperatures during the summer rise to about [...] but can often drop to [...] or even below freezing. Arctic tundras are sometimes the subject of habitat conservation programs. In Canada and Russia, many of these areas are protected through a national Biodiversity Action Plan.|$|E
6000|$|There is {{no great}} {{difficulty}} in understanding how an anemophilous plant {{might have been}} rendered entomophilous. Pollen is a nutritious substance, and would soon have been discovered and devoured by insects; and if any adhered to their bodies {{it would have been}} carried from the anthers to the stigma of the same flower, or from one flower to another. One of the chief characteristics of the pollen of anemophilous plants is its incoherence; but pollen in this state can adhere to the hairy bodies of insects, as we see with some Leguminosae, <b>Ericaceae,</b> and Melastomaceae. We have, however, better evidence of the possibility of a transition of the above kind in certain plants being now fertilised partly by the wind and partly by insects. The common rhubarb (Rheum rhaponticum) is so far in an intermediate condition, that I have seen many Diptera sucking the flowers, with much pollen adhering to their bodies; and yet the pollen is so incoherent, that clouds of it are emitted if the plant be gently shaken on a sunny day, some of which could hardly fail to fall on the large stigmas of the neighbouring flowers. According to Delpino and Hermann Muller, some species of Plantago are in a similar intermediate condition. (10/44. 'Die Befruchtung' etc. page 342.) ...|$|E
6000|$|Curious Relations of Mascarene Plants.--Among {{the curious}} affinities of Mascarene plants we have culled the {{following}} from Mr. Baker's volume. Trochetia, a genus of Sterculiaceæ, has four species in Mauritius, one in Madagascar, {{and one in}} the remote island of St. Helena. Mathurina, a genus of Turneraceæ, consisting of a single species peculiar to Rodriguez, has its nearest ally in another monotypic genus, Erblichia, confined to Central America. Siegesbeckia, one of the Compositæ, consists of two species, one inhabiting the Mascarene islands, the other Peru. Labourdonasia, a genus of Sapotaceæ, has two species in Mauritius, one in Natal, and one in Cuba. Nesogenes, belonging to the verbena family, has one species in Rodriguez and one in Polynesia. Mespilodaphne, an extensive genus of Lauraceæ, has six species in the Mascarene islands, and all the rest (about fifty species) in South America. Nepenthes, the well-known pitcher plants, are found chiefly in the Malay Islands, South China, and Ceylon, with species in the Seychelles Islands, {443} and in Madagascar. Milla, a large genus of Liliaceæ, is exclusively American, except one species found in Mauritius and Bourbon. Agauria, a genus of <b>Ericaceæ,</b> is found in Madagascar, the Mascarene islands, the plateau of Central Africa, and the Camaroon Mountains in West Africa. An acacia, found in Mauritius and Bourbon (A. heterophylla), can hardly be separated specifically from Acacia koa of the Sandwich Islands. The genus Pandanus, or screw-pine, has sixteen species in the three islands--Mauritius, Rodriguez, and the Seychelles--all being peculiar, and none ranging beyond a single island. Of palms there are fifteen species belonging to ten genera, and all these genera are peculiar to the islands. We have here ample evidence that plants exhibit the same anomalies of distribution in these islands as do the animals, though in a smaller proportion; while they also exhibit some of the transitional stages by which these anomalies have, in all probability, been brought about, rendering quite unnecessary any other changes in the distribution of sea and land than physical and geological evidence warrants.[114] ...|$|E
60|$|Gartner has {{designated}} by this term a peculiar {{condition of the}} anthers in certain plants, {{in which they are}} shrivelled, or become brown and tough, and contain no good pollen. When in this state they exactly resemble the anthers of the most sterile hybrids. Gartner (18/88. 'Beitrage zur Kenntniss' etc. s. 117 et seq.; Kolreuter 'Zweite Fortsetzung' s. 10, 121; 'Dritte Fortsetzung' s. 57. Herbert 'Amaryllidaceae' page 355. Wiegmann 'Ueber die Bastarderzeugung' s. 27.), in his discussion on this subject, has shown that plants of many orders are occasionally thus affected; but the Caryophyllaceae and Liliaceae suffer most, and to these orders, I think, the <b>Ericaceae</b> may be added. Contabescence varies in degree, but on the same plant all the flowers are generally affected to nearly the same extent. The anthers are affected at a very early period in the flower-bud, and remain in the same state (with one recorded exception) during the life of the plant. The affection cannot be cured by any change of treatment, and is propagated by layers, cuttings, etc., and perhaps even by seed. In contabescent plants the female organs are seldom affected, or merely become precocious in their development. The cause of this affection is doubtful, and is different in different cases. Until I read Gartner's discussion I attributed it, as apparently did Herbert, to the unnatural treatment of the plants; but its permanence under changed conditions, and the female organs not being affected, seem incompatible with this view. The fact of several endemic plants becoming contabescent in our gardens seems, at first sight, equally incompatible with this view; but Kolreuter believes that this is the result of their transplantation. The contabescent plants of Dianthus and Verbascum, found wild by Wiegmann, grew on a dry and sterile bank. The fact that exotic plants are eminently liable to this affection also seems to show that it is in some manner caused by their unnatural treatment. In some instances, as with Silene, Gartner's view seems the most probable, namely, that it is caused by an inherent tendency in the species to become dioecious. I can add another cause, namely, the illegitimate unions of heterostyled plants, for I have observed seedlings of three species of Primula and of Lythrum salicaria, which had been raised from plants illegitimately fertilised by their own-form pollen, with some or all their anthers in a contabescent state. There is perhaps an additional cause, namely, self-fertilisation; for many plants of Dianthus and Lobelia, which had been raised from self-fertilised seeds, had their anthers in this state; but these instances are not conclusive, as both genera are liable from other causes to this affection.|$|E
