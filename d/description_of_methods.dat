In some cases existing methods cannot cope {{with the requirements of}} the project situation at hand. There-fore new methods must be developed. Method Engineering (ME) attends to this application field. In this article, we provide a detailed overview of IS method en-gineering approaches in order to describe the concept of method engineering. Based on a literature review we derive a formal <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>methods</b> {{that can be used to}} describe methods in a basic way and transfer them to other fields of appli-cation. With the formal <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>methods</b> this article facilitates the process of understanding method engineering both for method user and its engineer. 1...|$|E
