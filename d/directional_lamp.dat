40|$|In {{order to}} be {{recognized}} as a competent testing and calibration laboratory, metrology laboratories who aim to obtain an accreditation for specific tests need to fulfill a number of general requirements as stipulated in the International Standard ISO/IEC 17025. One way to assure the quality of testing is to participate in proficiency testing programs or to conduct interlaboratory comparisons. In this paper, luminous intensity distribution measurements of three LED lamps, performed in two metrology laboratories according to the CIE and IESNA standard guidelines, are presented and compared. Significant differences are found for LID results of a <b>directional</b> <b>lamp,</b> due to high-dynamic range issues being observed in the near-field goniophotometer. It is also detected that the correlated color temperature influences the illuminance measurement of the photometer in the goniophotometer. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Lighting {{fittings}} {{creates the}} sensations, {{the atmosphere and}} the feelings: an inspired choice can contribute decisively {{to the creation of}} great images in terms of interior design to a room. Either we talk about classic or modern luminaires, lamps or chandeliers, luxury or normal, only our imagination limits us to use ingenious light. Diversity desk lamp market is so big that it's hard to bring something innovative, but a rigorous analysis on the needs of people in terms of lighting, result in the development of products with forms of increasingly strange but that draw the attention of many. The {{purpose of this article is}} to develop a product design type unidiretional lamp equipped with remote this will fulfill the aim of the design, namely ‘product’. The <b>directional</b> <b>lamp</b> proposed is a luminaire with unique design, equipped with the latest characteristics...|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of bulbs for {{recessed}} lighting: directional and diffuse. <b>Directional</b> <b>lamps</b> (R, BR, PAR, MR) contain s that direct and control the light. Diffuse lamps (A, S, PS, G) control light distribution through their omnidirectional light.|$|R
5000|$|Since 2012 [...] A+ and A++ {{classes are}} added and are {{introduced}} different classes for <b>directional</b> <b>lamps</b> and non-directional lamps.Directional lamps {{are defined as}} [...] "having at least 80 % light output within a solid angle of π sr (corresponding to a cone with angle of 120°)".|$|R
50|$|In 1955, the {{separate}} brake lights were discontinued and were combined {{into a new}} larger taillight housing. The traditional VW semaphore turn signals were replaced by conventional flashing <b>directional</b> indicator <b>lamps</b> for North America.|$|R
2500|$|The EU set {{a target}} of 2016 to phase out halogen bulbs with two {{directives}} [...] EC 244/2009 and EC 1194/2012. The phase {{out of the first}} directive EC 244/2009 originally planned for September 2016 was delayed until September 2018. The second directive EC 1194/2012 was upheld, as part of a review of the lighting directive four criteria needed to be assessed before a phase-out could be confirmed. Issues of ‘affordability’ were under scrutiny, as well as performance, equivalence to existing models and compatibility. The EU confirmed that there was absolutely no reason to delay the ban on mains voltage <b>directional</b> halogen <b>lamps,</b> as all four of the criteria had been sufficiently met. [...] The directive EC 1194/2012 relates to mains voltage <b>directional</b> halogen <b>lamps</b> and means many common halogen reflector lamps such as D rated GU10's are affected.|$|R
2500|$|In 1970, fender flares were {{designed}} {{into the body}} contours to reduce wheel-thrown debris damage. New were egg-crate grills with matching front fender side vents and larger squared front <b>directional</b> <b>lamps.</b> The previously round dual exhaust outlets were made larger and rectangular in shape. Interiors were tweaked with redesigned seats and a new deluxe interior option combined wood-grain wood accents and higher-spec carpeting with leather seat surfaces. Positraction rear axle, tinted glass, and a wide-ratio 4-speed manual transmission were now standard. The [...] base engine (ZQ3) remained at [...] and the L46 was again offered as a [...] high performance upgrade. New was the LT-1, a [...] small-block V8 engine delivering a factory rated [...] It was a solid lifter motor featuring a forged steel crankshaft, 4-bolt main block, 11:1 compression ratio, impact extruded pistons, high-lift camshaft, low-restriction exhaust, aluminum intake manifold, 4-barrel carburetor, and finned aluminum rocker covers. The new engine, making up less than 8% of production, could not be ordered with air conditioning but was fitted with a domed hood adorned with “LT-1” decals.|$|R
50|$|The 1960 Cadillacs {{exhibited}} smoother styling, {{more subtle}} {{rendition of the}} styling theme introduced one year earlier. General changes included a full-width grille; the elimination of pointed front bumper guards; increased restraint {{in the application of}} chrome trim; lower tailfins with oval shaped nacelles which encased stacked taillights and back up lamps and front fender mounted <b>directional</b> indicator <b>lamps.</b> The long wheelbase sedan and limousine had auxiliary jump seats, high-headroom formal six-window styling, broad ribbed edge beauty panels and trim generally similar to Series 6200 Cadillacs in other respects. The limousine passenger compartment was trimmed in either bradford cloth or Bedford cloth, both in combinations with wool. Florentine leather upholstery was used in the chauffeur's compartment. Standard equipment was essentially the same as the previous year.|$|R
50|$|The 1960 Cadillacs had smoother, more {{restrained}} styling. General changes {{included a}} full-width grille, {{the elimination of}} pointed front bumper guards, increased restraint {{in the application of}} chrome trim, lower tailfins with oval shaped nacelles and front fender mounted <b>directional</b> indicator <b>lamps.</b> DeVilles were distinguished by special script nameplates on the rear fenders. Four-window and six-window hardtop sedans were offered again. The former featured a one-piece wraparound backlight and flat-top roof, while the latter had a sloping rear window and roofline. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, dual back-up lamps, windshield wipers, two-speed wipers, wheel discs, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror, oil filter, power windows and a two-way power seats. Technical highlights were finned rear drums and an X-frame construction. Interiors were done in Chadwick cloth or optional Cambray cloth and leather combinations.|$|R
40|$|Visual {{perspective}} taking is {{a fundamental}} feature of the human social brain. Previous research has mainly focused on explicit visual perspective taking and contrasted brain activation for other- versus self-perspective judgements. This produced a conceptual gap to theory of mind studies, where researchers mainly compared activation for taking another's mental perspective to non-mental control conditions. We compared brain activation for visual perspective taking to activation for non-mental control conditions where the avatar was replaced by <b>directional</b> (arrow, <b>lamp)</b> or non-directional (brick-wall) objects. We found domain-specific activation linked to the avatar's visual perspective in right TPJ, ventral mPFC and ventral precuneus. Interestingly, we found that these areas are spontaneously processing information linked to the other's perspective during self-perspective judgements. Based on {{a review of the}} visual perspective taking literature, we discuss how these findings can explain some of the inconsistent/negative results found in previous studies comparing other- versus self-perspective judgements...|$|R
50|$|The 1960 Cadillacs had smoother, more {{restrained}} styling. General changes {{included a}} full-width grille, {{the elimination of}} pointed front bumper guards, increased restraint {{in the application of}} chrome trim, lower tailfins with oval shaped nacelles and front fender mounted <b>directional</b> indicator <b>lamps.</b> External variations on the Seville two-door hardtop and Biarritz convertible took the form of bright body sill highlights that extended across the lower edge of fender skirts and Eldorado lettering {{on the sides of the}} front fenders, just behind the headlamps. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, dual back-up lamps, windshield wipers, two-speed wipers, wheel discs, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror, oil filter, power windows, six-way power seats, heater, fog lamps, Eldorado engine, remote control trunk lock, radio with antenna and rear speaker, power vent windows, air suspension, electric door locks, license frames, and five whitewall tires. Technical highlights were finned rear drums and an X-frame construction. Interiors were done in Chadwick cloth or optional Cambray cloth and leather combinations. The last Eldorado Seville was built in 1960.|$|R
50|$|The 1960 Series 62 had smoother, more {{restrained}} styling. General changes {{included a}} full-width grille, {{the elimination of}} pointed front bumper guards, increased restraint {{in the application of}} chrome trim, lower tailfins with oval shaped nacelles and front fender mounted <b>directional</b> indicator <b>lamps.</b> Series 62 models were distinguished by plain fender skirts, thin three-quarter length bodyside spears and Cadillac crests and lettering on short horizontal front fender bars mounted just behind the headlights. Four-window and six-window hardtop sedans were offered again. The former featured a one-piece wraparound backlight and flat-top roof, while the latter had a sloping rear window and roofline. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, dual back-up lamps, windshield wipers, two-speed wipers, wheel discs, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror and oil filter. The convertible model had power windows and a two-way power seat. Technical highlights were finned rear drums and an X-frame construction. Interiors were done in Fawn, Blue or Gray Cortina Cord or Turquoise, Green, Persian Sand, or Black Caspian cloth with Florentine vinyl bolsters. Convertibles were upholstered in Florentine leather single or two-tone combinations or monochromatic Cardiff leather combinations.|$|R
5000|$|While styling for the Jet was conservative, the Italia was {{anything}} but. The Italia was 10 in lower than a Jet. Over the headlights, the front fenders featured [...] "V" [...] shaped scoops, ducting cooling {{air to the}} front brakes, but they really only vent [...] "the underside of the fender {{and the top of}} the tire." [...] The front bumper sported a large inverted [...] "V" [...] (the trademark Hudson triangle, inverted) in the center that angled up and overlapped the grille work. Rear quarter scoops cooled the rear brakes. In the back of the car, the tail, <b>directional,</b> and back-up <b>lamps</b> tipped the ends of three stacked chrome tubes per side, emerging from scalloped cut-outs in the rear quarter panels. The production models did not receive overdrive, the instrument panel was different, and a combination of leather-and-vinyl upholstery was used.|$|R
