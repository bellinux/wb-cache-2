The books were adapted for the 1960 film School for Scoundrels, starring Alastair Sim, Terry-Thomas, Ian Carmichael and Irene <b>Handl.</b> Later they were adapted by Barry Took into a BBC TV comedy series called One-Upmanship (1974–78), starring Richard Briers and Peter Jones.

50|$|Jacob <b>Handl's</b> Ecce quomodo moritur justus motet was sung at Protestant burials in the 16th century. In 1682, Gottfried Vopelius {{published}} <b>Handl's</b> motet with a singable German translation ("Siehe, wie dahin stirbt der Gerechte") on p. 263 of the Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch, {{for performance}} on Good Friday. <b>Handl's</b> motet {{was performed on}} Good Friday in Protestant churches in Wrocław and Leipzig. The music of <b>Handl's</b> setting, by that time perceived as a Protestant funeral motet, is quoted in George Frideric Handel's Funeral Anthem for Queen Caroline, HWV 264.|$|R

5000|$|As a {{physicist}} he conducted {{studies in the}} fields of crystallography, barometry, hydrodensitometry, and also did research involving light absorption, the specific resistance of liquids, and color vision in animals, to name a few. With chemist Richard Pribram (1847-1928), he conducted investigations on the viscosity of different organic compounds, with results of their work being published in the Sitzungsberichte of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and in Wilhelm Ostwald’s Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie. <b>Handl's</b> textbook of physics for middle-school students, [...] "Lehrbuch der Physik für die oberen Classen der Mittelschulen", was published over several editions.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Handl's</b> {{experiment}} {{included the}} acquisition of fissile material from outside the country, a radiator suitable for transmutation, and instruments to measure the reaction, including a Geiger counter. He spent about $6,000 in materials and equipment. Experiments were done with tritium, americium, aluminium, beryllium, thorium, radium, and uranium, most of which he acquired from foreign companies. One step involved cooking americium, radium and beryllium in 96% sulfuric acid on a stove in order to more easily mix the ingredients; this resulted in an explosion. He kept a blog called [...] "Richard's Reactor" [...] in which he documented {{the progress of the}} reactor.|$|R

This {{chapter is}} {{based on the work of}} the Open Graves, Open Minds: Vampires and the Undead in Modern Culture Research Project at the University of Hertfordshire. The project relates the undead in literature, art, and other media to {{questions}} concerning gender, technology, consumption, and social change, and was initiated by a conference in April 2010. The project has generated a series of events, publications, and inspiring discussions. Select papers from the 2010 conference have appeared in a special edition of Gothic Studies (May 2013); other papers and specially commissioned chapters appear in a monograph, Open Graves, Open Minds: Representations of Vampires and the Undead from the Enlightenment to the Present (Manchester: MUP, 2013). Further publications will follow and more conferences are planned, including ???The Company of Wolves': Sociality, Animality, and Subjectivity in Literary and Cultural Narratives-Werewolves, Shapeshifters, and Feral Humans' - a conference to be held at UH in July 2015. OGOM has generated a Gothic Reading Group, and recruited 2 PhD students, one working on vampires and the other on werewolves. The project is clearly unusual in deriving its content directly from popular culture, and in its capacity to network with fans and enthusiasts well beyond the normal limitations of the academy. Graham Holderness's Black and Deep Desires: William Shakespeare Vampire Hunter (Top Hat Books, 2015), draws Shakespeare studies and historical fiction into the environment of the undead. This chapter will explore how the novel was produced by linking academic considerations with popular enthusiasm and exploratory creative writing. It will reference other parallel experiments such as Lori <b>Handl???s</b> Shakespeare Undead and the film Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter. The main objective is to reveal the creative potentiality of a Shakespeare liberated from the academy and thrown wide open to communities of users...|$|R
