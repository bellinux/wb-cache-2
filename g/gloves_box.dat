40|$|International audienceNuclear waste {{disposal}} are being installed in deep excavated rock formations {{in some places}} in Europe to isolate and store radioactive waste. To ensure long term safety and to provide reliable data for future decision making process, {{it is necessary to}} implement long-term monitoring sensors. Thereby, robust, sustainable, reliable and autonomous sensors (no-maintenance required) have to be developed to measure the most important physical and chemical parameters. This study aims at developing and optimizing a multi-parametric device composed of all-solid-state electrodes for the long term monitoring of pH, redox potential (ORP) and ionic conductivity. The multi-parametric device consists of a limited number of inert or/and weakly alterable electrodes, allowing auto-controlled and redundant open circuit potential differences measurements in semi-continuous way. Based upon the reversible interfacial redox processes involving H+, Sb 2 O 3 /Sb system has been regarded among the most promising technologies to be devoted to the monitoring of pH into the underground components of nuclear disposal due to its physical and chemical stability, with regards to temperature, pressure and aggressive environments 1. For redox potential measurements, platinum wires (Pt-Ir alloy; 90 - 10 %) were selected among the “inert” conductive material presenting physical and chemical stability properties. All-Solid-state AgCl/Agcoated/Ag was selected for the development of non-conventional reference electrodes since its potential only depends on Cl- concentration and because the on-site Cl- concentration should remain relatively stable on the long term 2. Performance and reliability were examined by potentiometric measurements in various pH buffer solutions at 25 °C, under atmospheric conditions as well as in an “oxygen free” <b>gloves</b> <b>box</b> (99 % N 2, 1 % CO 2 and [O 2]< 2 ppm). Investigations were limited in pH, ranging from 5. 5 to 13. 5, close to those encountered in the environment of the nuclear repositories. Robustness was then investigated over six months in a synthetic solution whose composition in major elements and pH was representative of the Callovo-Oxfordian (COx) pore water. For conductivity measurements, both platinum wires as well as AgCl/Agcoated-Ag electrodes were used. The Galvanostatic Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (GEIS) was used, which consisted in applying a known alternating current (AC) between the two most distant electrodes and to measure the induced potential between two other electrodes. The Sb-electrode proved to be reliable for pH measurements. In the absence of any redox couple, except O 2 /H 2 O, the platinum electrode showed a linear potentiometric response to pH variations. The all-solid-state AgCl/Agcoated-Ag electrode showed a stable potentiometric response over several months even when subjected to pH variations. According to our results, the long-term monitoring of pH and ORP via the multi-parametric device is feasible. Further investigations are in progress regarding: (i) the influence of redox species such as S(VI) /S(II) or Fe(III) /Fe(II) and (ii) corrosion rates of each electrode materials in order to estimate electrodes lifetime and therefore of the device...|$|E

40|$|In {{a nuclear}} fuel cycle facility, radiotoxic {{materials}} are being handled in freestanding leak tight enclosures called <b>glove</b> <b>boxes</b> (GBs). These <b>glove</b> <b>boxes</b> {{act as a}} primary confinement for the radiotoxic materials. <b>Glove</b> <b>boxes</b> are designed as per codal requirements for class I component. They are designed to withstand extreme level of earthquake loading with a return period of 10, 000 years. To evaluate seismic performance of the <b>glove</b> <b>box,</b> {{there is a need}} to check the stability (sliding and overturning), structural integrity (stresses and strains) and leak tightness under earthquake loading. Extensive shake table experiments were conducted on a single standalone <b>glove</b> <b>box.</b> Actual laboratory conditions were simulated during testing to check the response. After extensive shake table testing, <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> structure was also analyzed using finite element (FE) software. Detailed three-dimensional model of <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> structure was developed and analyzed using nonlinear time history method. It was observed that finite element methods could be utilized to accurately predict dynamic response of <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> structure. This paper discusses the details and results of shake table testing and methodology used for modelling and analysing freestanding <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> structure under seismic loading. In addition, simplified numerical procedure, developed using energy conservation principle is applied to estimate approximate sliding displacement of the <b>glove</b> <b>box.</b> (C) 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|We have {{developed}} {{a new approach to}} <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> monitoring that involves drawing air out of one glove port through a detection grid that collects ions created in the air inside the <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> by ionizing radiation, especially alpha radiation. The charge deposited on the detection grid by the ions is measured with a sensitive electrometer. The air can be circulated back to the <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> through the other glove port, preventing contamination from leaving the <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> and detector system. Initial experiments using a mock-up constructed of sheet metal indicate that this technology provides the measurement technique needed to perform a defensible, non-invasive measurement of alpha contamination inside <b>glove</b> <b>boxes</b> destined for waste disposal. This can result in an enormous cost savings if a given <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> can be shown to fall into the catagory of Low-Level Waste rather than Trans-Uranic Waste. Considering that hundreds of <b>glove</b> <b>boxes</b> contaminated with plutonium will be taken out of service at various nuclear facilities over the next few years, the potential cost savings associated with disposal as LLW rather than TRU waste are substantial...|$|R

40|$|A small, lightweight, {{collapsible}} <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> enables its user {{to perform}} small experiments and other tasks. Originally {{intended for use}} aboard a space shuttle or the International Space Station (ISS), this <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> could also be attractive for use on Earth in settings in which work space or storage space is severely limited and, possibly, {{in which it is}} desirable to minimize weight. The development of this <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> was prompted by the findings that in the original space-shuttle or ISS setting, (1) it was necessary to perform small experiments in a large general-purpose work station, so that, in effect, they occupied excessive space; and it took excessive amounts of time to set up small experiments. The design of the <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> reflects the need to minimize the space occupied by experiments and the time needed to set up experiments, plus the requirement to limit the launch weight of the box and the space needed to store the box during transport into orbit. To prepare the <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> for use, the astronaut or other user has merely to insert hands through the two fabric glove ports in the side walls of the box and move two hinges to a locking vertical position (see figure). The user could do this while seated with the <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> on the user fs lap. When stowed, the <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> is flat and has approximately the thickness of two pieces of 8 -in.

40|$|The Los Alamos LSDDP {{demonstrated}} a Mega-Tech hydraulic cutting shear to remove legs from plutonium <b>glove</b> <b>boxes.</b> The baseline technology used at LANL for removal of <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> legs is a reciprocating saw. Legs on <b>glove</b> <b>boxes</b> are typically either 3 -inch diameter pipe or unistrut. During the demonstration, the Mega-Tech hydraulic cutting shear cut eight pipe legs in 15 minutes, while the reciprocating saw took 45 - 60 minutes {{to cut through}} eight legs, including a rest break to alleviate worker fatigue. Despite its lower production rate, the reciprocating saw may be favored in confined spaces, {{because it does not}} require as much access room as the hydraulic shears. Based on the faster production rate of the hydraulic shear, LANL and Rocky Flats are expected to begin using the hydraulic shear as their new baseline technology to remove legs from over 1, 500 plutonium <b>glove</b> <b>boxes</b> at the two sites...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to provide {{radiological}} engineering services for the design of special contamination containments. These containments were to be used during the replacement of leaking and damaged gaskets on the <b>glove</b> <b>boxes</b> in Technical Area- 55 (TA- 55). The damaged gaskets involved 18 windows and 5 interconnecting spool pieces in fuel processing <b>glove</b> <b>boxes.</b> The work scope included the design and manufacture of special contamination containment enclosures (containments), the preparation of procedures and tool lists to support gasket replacement while using the containments, and the training of appropriate TA- 55 personnel in the proper installation, operation and removal of the containments. It was originally anticipated that two basic containment designs would be required, one for the windows and one for spool pieces. Upon examination of the <b>glove</b> <b>boxes</b> it was evident that the individual space envelopes and interferences associated with each <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> would require uniquely designed containments for effective gasket replacement. This resulted in 13 individual containment designs that accommodated the interferences and allowed gasket replacement within the containment. Successful use of the containments for <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> gasket replacement was a significant accomplishment. The operation has proven that a properly managed containment program can enhance routine maintenance of the <b>glove</b> <b>boxes</b> while preventing a contamination release. The ability to perform these operations in containments reduces costs by preventing a contaminant release and eliminating the associated cleanup expenses, reduced radioactive waste and fuel processing down time...|$|R
