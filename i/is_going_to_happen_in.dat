NESARA supporters often tell their readers that the NESARA announcement <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> a matter of days. These claims have been made too many times to enumerate, without ever coming to fruition. According to the documentary Waiting For NESARA, the claim was also made prior to March 2003 that George Bush was planning the war with Iraq only to further delay the NESARA announcement. It was prophesied that spiritual beings and UFOs would intervene with Bush's plans and prevent the war.|$|E
