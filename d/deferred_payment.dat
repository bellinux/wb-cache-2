In 2014 after negotiations between the city and the police officers union reached an agreement on police officer pay that would give pay increases to nearly 1,000 officers who joined the department since the salaries for incoming officers were cut. The agreement also raised starting salaries for officers to $57,420 with an additional increase to $60,552 after 6 months which would become effective in the beginning of 2015. The agreement would also change the current overtime payment system from a <b>deferred</b> <b>payment</b> system, which was implemented to cut costs, to a pay-as-you-go overtime system as well as increasing the overtime budget from $30 million to $70 million.|$|E

The positive wealth effect of the choice of initial payment method in earnout deals is more prominent in cross-border deals than in domestic deals.

Roman peasants who needed money to pay their taxes would use an inverted form of this process by selling the right to a portion of their harvest in the future in exchange for cash in the present. The Sulpicii arose as professional bankers in the first century AD, and among other forms of financial intermediation, they offered financing for speculators in grain markets.|$|R

Abbess ran out of time to film this scene using conventional techniques, so positioned the camera {{at the end of the}} hallway and used [...] "crash zooms… in and out of the action" [...] to highlight the key moments. Abbess studied other low-budget films like Requiem for a Dream and Donnie Darko to identify ways the filmmakers worked around their small budgets.|$|E
