5|$|The inaugural Palestine League {{title was}} won by British Police, who {{finished}} the season unbeaten and {{also won the}} People's Cup to complete the country's first double. Except for Jerusalem-based British Police's initial victory, only clubs <b>from</b> <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv</b> won the title during the Mandate period; Hapoel and Maccabi Tel Aviv won five and four championships respectively. Because of violent conflicts involving the Yishuv, the competition's scheduling was inconsistent and in some seasons no national championship was held.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1948 war the Arab {{orchards}} to {{the east}} of Tel Aviv were opened for development, and the military started using the Sde Dov airport on a regular basis. The airport regained its commercial operations, initially serving domestic flights, mostly to single customers, on Piper Cub aircraft. It later expanded operations to scheduled service on larger aircraft to various parts of Israel. As a result of the land availability, an additional, northsouth, runway was built with no opposition. By 1960, land in Tel Aviv became scarce, and the municipality demanded that the airport be relocated northward, so as to allow residential development in its place. However, a committee that investigated in 1961 the options for such a relocation found no feasible site in proximity to Tel Aviv and suggested that flights be moved to Lod airport (now known as Ben Gurion Airport), and that road access <b>from</b> <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv</b> to Lod be improved. This option, however, was blocked by the Israel Defense Forces.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, {{the mayor}} of Tel Aviv Israel Rokach asked the British mandate {{authorities}} for permission to create an airport in Palestine, promising to solve the transportation problem of Jews during the Arab revolt of 193639 when travelling <b>from</b> <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv</b> through Arab territory to the main airport at Lydda, to catch Palestine Airways flights to Haifa, was difficult and dangerous. Works began on a plot of land north of the Yarkon River, Tel Aviv and when completed in October 1938, the airport served regular flights to Haifa, with the option of flights to Beirut. In 1940, the airport's name was changed to Sde Dov, in memory of Dov Hoz, {{one of the pioneers}} of Jewish aviation. Sde Dov was abandoned after Palestine Airways ceased operations in August 1940 and the site was used as a British Army base until December 1947 when with British permission the runway was reopened by Haganah.|$|E

5|$|In June 1976, Amin {{allowed an}} Air France {{airliner}} <b>from</b> <b>Tel</b> <b>Aviv</b> to Paris hijacked by {{two members of}} the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – External Operations (PFLP-EO) and {{two members of the}} German Revolutionäre Zellen to land at Entebbe Airport. The hijackers were joined there by three more. Soon after, 156 non-Jewish hostages who did not hold Israeli passports were released and flown to safety, while 83 Jews and Israeli citizens, as well as 20 others who refused to abandon them (among whom were the captain and crew of the hijacked Air France jet), continued to be held hostage. In the subsequent Israeli rescue operation, codenamed Operation Thunderbolt (popularly known as Operation Entebbe), on the night of 3–4 July 1976, a group of Israeli commandos were flown in from Israel and seized control of Entebbe Airport, freeing nearly all the hostages. Three hostages died during the operation and 10 were wounded; 7 hijackers, about 45 Ugandan soldiers, and 1 Israeli soldier, Yoni Netanyahu, were killed. A fourth hostage, 75-year-old Dora Bloch, an elderly Jewish Englishwoman who had been taken to Mulago Hospital in Kampala before the rescue operation, was subsequently murdered in reprisal. The incident further soured Uganda's international relations, leading the United Kingdom to close its High Commission in Uganda.|$|E
