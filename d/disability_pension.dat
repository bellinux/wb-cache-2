Incidence rates of <b>disability</b> <b>pensions</b> for cement workers, painters and plumbers {{were compared with}} 2 control groups. A total of 623 <b>disability</b> <b>pensions</b> were granted during 4 decades of follow-up. The main diagnoses were eczema (36 %) and psoriasis (49 %). Pensions were mostly granted in the age range 55 - 64 years. Among painters, cement workers and plumbers the incidence rates for <b>disability</b> <b>pensions</b> were 33. 3, 24. 5 and 20. 4 cases/ 100, 000 person-years, respectively, compared with 13. 7 and 9. 2 cases/ 100, 000 person-years in control groups. Relative risks were highest for eczema, and were notable for psoriasis. Attributable fractions for eczema were 90 % in cement workers and painters and 75 % in plumbers compared with control groups. Attributable fractions for psoriasis in the occupational groups studied were in the range 54 - 67 %. In conclusion, eczema and psoriasis have a high impact on loss of work ability, as reflected by <b>disability</b> <b>pensions...</b>|$|R

5|$|Harrison quickly saw the {{enactment}} of the Dependent and <b>Disability</b> <b>Pension</b> Act in 1890, a cause he had championed while in Congress. In addition to providing pensions to disabled Civil War veterans (regardless of the cause of their disability), the Act depleted some of the troublesome federal budget surplus. Pension expenditures reached $135million under Harrison, the largest expenditure of its kind to that point in American history, a problem exacerbated by Pension Bureau commissioner James R. Tanner's expansive interpretation of the pension laws. An investigation into the Pension Bureau by Harrison's Secretary of Interior John W. Noble found evidence of lavish and illegal handouts under Tanner. Harrison, who privately believed that appointing Tanner had been a mistake, due to his apparent loose management style and tongue, asked Tanner to resign and replaced him with Green B. Raum. Raum was also accused of accepting loan payments in return for expediting pension cases. Harrison, having accepted a dissenting Congressional Republican investigation report that exonerated Raum, kept him in office {{for the rest of his}} administration.|$|E
5|$|Mills's and Cleveland's defeat on the tariff {{bill could}} be {{considered}} a victory for Randall, but the vote showed how isolated the former Speaker's protectionist ideas now made him in his party: only four Democrats voted against the tariff reductions. The state party likewise turned against Randall and toward free trade, adopting a pro-tariff revision platform at the 1888 state Democratic convention. At the same time, Randall seemingly reversed his long-standing commitment to fiscal economy by voting with the Republicans to override Cleveland's veto of the Dependent and <b>Disability</b> <b>Pension</b> Act. The Act would have given a pension to every Union veteran (or their widows) who claimed he could no longer perform physical labor, regardless of whether his disability was war-related. Cleveland's veto was in line with his record of small-government cost-cutting, with which Randall would normally have sympathized. Randall, perhaps in an effort to gain favor with veterans in his district, joined the Republicans in an unsuccessful attempt to override Cleveland's veto. Another possibility proposed by biographer House is that Randall saw the federal budget surplus as reason to cut tariffs; by increasing federal spending, he hoped to decrease the surplus and maintain the need for high tariffs. Whatever the reason, the attempt failed and left Randall further alienated from his fellow Democrats.|$|E

25|$|Under Olof Palme's premiership tenure, matters {{concerned}} with child care centers, social security, {{protection of the}} elderly, accident safety, and housing problems received special attention. Under Palme the public health system in Sweden became efficient, with the infant mortality rate standing at 12 per 1,000 live births. An ambitious redistributive programme was carried out, with special help provided to the disabled, immigrants, the low paid, single-parent families, and the old. The Swedish welfare state was significantly expanded from a position already {{one of the most}} far-reaching in the world during his time in office. As noted by Isabela Mares, {{during the first half of}} the Seventies “the level of benefits provided by every subsystem of the welfare state improved significantly.” Various policy changes increased the basic old-age pension replacement rate from 42% of the average wage in 1969 to 57%, while a health care reform carried out in 1974 integrated all health services and increased the minimum replacement rate from 64% to 90% of earnings. In 1974, supplementary unemployment assistance was established, providing benefits to those workers ineligible for existing benefits. In 1971, eligibility for invalidity pensions was extended with greater opportunities for employees over the age of 60. In 1974, universal dental insurance was introduced, and former maternity benefits were replaced by a parental allowance. In 1974, housing allowances for families with children were raised and these allowances were extended to other low-income groups. Childcare centres were also expanded under Palme, and separate taxation of husband and wife introduced. Access to pensions for older workers in poor health was liberalised in 1970, and a <b>disability</b> <b>pension</b> was introduced for older unemployed workers in 1972.|$|E

40|$|Germany's {{pension system}} was {{originally}} {{designed as a}} scaled premium system. It formally became a pay-as-you-go system in 1957. Participation in the system is mandatory for all dependent employees and only some groups of self-employed. The system is greatly fragmented in terms of institutions, coverage, contributions, and benefit levels. A discrepancy has emerged between the system dependency ratio and the demographic old-age dependency ratio. This has been caused {{by the use of}} early retirement and <b>disability</b> <b>pensions</b> as a means of tackling high unemployment, especially in Germany's 5 new states. Except for the high incidence of early retirement and <b>disability</b> <b>pensions</b> the system does not suffer from the problems that have afflicted other pension systems (e. g. evasion). The expected demographic aging poses major challenge. The contribution rate cannot be increased so benefits will have to be cut, most likely through an increase in the normal retirement age and tighter rules for <b>disability</b> <b>pensions</b> and early retirement. Germany's system is not overly generous, compared with other OECD countries. Intragenerational redistribution in the pension system is quite limited. Germany does not have a tilted benefit formula to redistribute income from higher to lower income groups. Means-tested social assistance is used to support the old poor.
