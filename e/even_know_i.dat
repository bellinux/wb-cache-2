2500|$|Niittymäki was the Philadelphia Flyers' 6th round pick (168th overall) in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft. [...] "I didn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> got drafted. I {{found out}} the next morning. I was really surprised," [...] {{he said in an}} {{interview}} in November 2003. Even if he had opted to go immediately to the United States to play hockey, compulsory military service kept Niittymäki in Finland until January 2001. He would return to TPS in 2012 for his final season, playing 14 games.|$|E
2500|$|In 1992 he {{established}} a relationship with Anselmo Feleppa, a Brazilian dress designer, whom he had met at the 1991 concert Rock in Rio. Six months into their relationship, Feleppa discovered that he was HIV positive. Michael later said: [...] "It was terrifying news. I thought I could have the disease too. I couldn't go through it with my family because I didn't know how {{to share it with}} them – they didn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> was gay." [...] In 1993, Feleppa died of an AIDS-related brain haemorrhage. Michael's single, [...] "Jesus to a Child", is a tribute to Feleppa (Michael consistently dedicated it to him before performing it live), as is his album Older (1996). In 2008, speaking about the loss of his partner Feleppa, Michael said: [...] "It was a terribly depressing time. It took about three years to grieve, then after that I lost my mother. I felt almost like I was cursed." ...|$|E

60|$|CONJURER. I did {{not tell}} you that because <b>I</b> do not <b>even</b> <b>know</b> it. <b>I</b> do not <b>know</b> whether <b>I</b> am only the Conjurer....|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have been}} reading the [...] "Memoir of Mr. Keble," [...] of course with extreme interest. It is all about events and chiefly about persons that one has heard about or <b>even</b> <b>known.</b> <b>I</b> think we get a little {{autobiography}} of our dear Uncle John in it too, for which I don't like it the less.|$|R
6000|$|... "Whoever he was, he {{knew the}} road and the men who {{travelled}} on it. Like ez not, he went over the line beside the driver on the box on the down trip, and took stock of everything. He <b>even</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> had those greenbacks; though they were handed to me in the bank at Sacramento. He must have been hanging 'round there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Simply {{that she}} may be THERE--just there before us. It's as if she may have a value--as if {{something}} may come of her. I don't in the least know what, and she rather irritates me meanwhile. I don't <b>even</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> admit, why--but if we see her often enough I may find out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My mind is much occupied," [...] he said. [...] "And {{you want}} to know why! Well, sir, I can assure you that not only do I not know why I do these things, but I did not <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> did them. Come to think, it is just as you say; I never have been beyond that field.... And these things annoy you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You won't believe me; you cannot believe me! for I do not <b>even</b> <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> {{have taken}} and {{exchanged}} letters--whose contents I never saw--between the Confederates and a spy {{who comes to}} this house, but who is far away by this time. I did it because I thought you hated and despised me because I thought it was my duty to help my cause--because {{you said it was}} 'war' between us--but I never spied on you. I swear it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} have been {{unconscious}} that you were avoiding me," [...] Mr. Brand replied. [...] "You have not <b>even</b> <b>known</b> that <b>I</b> was there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it's simply atrocious," [...] said Annie. [...] "I've {{nothing at}} all to do with either. <b>I</b> don't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> that <b>I</b> approve of their object." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of all the {{impulsive}} kids!" [...] she gurgled. [...] "I {{never met}} anyone like you, dadda! You don't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> that <b>I</b> can use a typewriter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He can't get me. I know he can't get me. I'm {{perfectly}} safe. I'm just {{as safe as}} if he were miles away. There's {{nothing to}} be afraid of. It is silly to be afraid. Probably Hooty doesn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> am inside here. Even if he does, it doesn't really matter." [...] Whitefoot said these things to himself over and over again. Then Hooty would send out that fierce, terrible hunting call and Whitefoot would jump and shake just as before.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} on the stage, Paul; you must have heard the saying often: 'Ah, well, the curtain must come down, however badly things are going.' It is only a play, Paul. We do not choose our parts. I did not <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> was the villain, till I heard the booing of the gallery. I even thought I was the hero, full of noble sentiment, sacrificing myself for the {{happiness}} of the heroine. She would have married me in the beginning had I plagued her sufficiently." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you must}} not quarrel with me, Hugh. Give me a kiss. I don't have you often with me; and yet {{you are the only}} man in the world that I ever speak to, or <b>even</b> <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> {{sometimes}} half think that the bread is so hard and the water so bitter, that life will become impossible. I try to get over it; but if you were to go away from me in anger, I should be so beaten {{for a week or two}} that I could do nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{are very}} conceited, Monsieur,' she mocked. 'How {{do you know}} what my womanly {{feelings}} are, or my thoughts or my ideas? You don't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> what <b>I</b> think of you now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As to that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> nothing, since <b>I</b> did not <b>even</b> <b>know</b> where <b>I</b> was {{bestowed}} until ye informed me. I {{was knocked}} senseless in the fight, after I had put my bilbo through your comely brother. That {{is the sum}} of my knowledge." ...|$|R
3000|$|Interviewee 3 : “The daughters! They give me much {{strength}} to move on, to continue life, right? If {{it were not}} for them, <b>I</b> don’t <b>even</b> <b>know</b> if <b>I</b> would be here today.” [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. I am much wiser {{now than}} I was once, Joyce. I have learned wisdom beyond the hills. One learns there--in time--but {{sometimes}} {{the lesson is}} learned too late. Shall I tell you what I have learned, Joyce? The gist of the lesson is that I left happiness behind me in the old valley, when I went away from it, happiness and peace and the joy of living. I did not miss these things for a long while; I did not <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> had lost them. But I have discovered my loss." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't only that," [...] {{explained}} Joey; [...] "she has ambitions, social ambitions. She {{thinks that}} if {{we begin with the}} wrong set, we'll never get into the right. We have three friends at present, and, so far as I can see, are never likely to have any more. My dear boy, you'd never believe there could exist such bores. There's a man and his wife named Holyoake. They dine with us on Thursdays, and we dine with them on Tuesdays. Their only title to existence consists in their having a cousin in the House of Lords; they claim no other right themselves. He is a widower, getting on for eighty. Apparently he's the only relative they have, and when he dies, they talk of retiring into the country. There's a fellow named Cutler, who visited once at Marlborough House in connection with a charity. You'd think to listen to him that he had designs upon the throne. The most tiresome of them all is a noisy woman who, as far as I can make out, hasn't any name at all. 'Miss Montgomery' is on her cards, but that is only what she calls herself. Who she really is! It would shake the foundations of European society if known. We sit and talk about the aristocracy; we don't seem to know anybody else. I tried on one occasion a little sarcasm as a corrective--recounted conversations between myself and the Prince of Wales, in which I invariably addressed him as 'Teddy.' It sounds tall, I know, but those people took it in. I was too astonished to undeceive them at the time, the consequence is I am a sort of little god to them. They come round me and ask for more. What am I to do? I am helpless among them. I've never had anything to do before with the really first-prize idiot; the usual type, of course, one knows, but these, if you haven't met them, are inconceivable. I try insulting them; they don't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> am insulting them. Short of dragging them out of their chairs and kicking them round the room, I don't see how to make them understand it." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Chris Azzopardi of Pride Source she said [...] "I didn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> was (gay) until later in life. I mean, I realized I was bisexual at about 18 but I didn't even realize I was gay until into my 20s." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't understand," [...] he said. [...] "There is {{only one}} reason {{in the world that}} I would admit--I don't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> that <b>I</b> would accept that. The other things don't count. They don't exist." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "You Don't <b>Even</b> <b>Know</b> Who <b>I</b> Am" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American country music artist Patty Loveless. It was released in March 1995 as the third single from her album When Fallen Angels Fly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{sure she}} doesn't {{know who you}} are," [...] {{answered}} the detective, positively. [...] "She doesn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> herself. <b>I</b> have <b>known</b> instances where every recollection of the past was wiped out of the patient's mind." ...|$|R
5000|$|My Baby's Gone is {{an album}} by American country music duo The Louvin Brothers, {{released}} in 1960. The lead-off single [...] "My Baby Came Back" [...] b/w [...] "She Didn't <b>Even</b> <b>Know</b> <b>I</b> Was Gone" [...] did not chart although the follow-up single [...] "My Baby's Gone" [...] b/w [...] "Lorene" [...] reached number 9 on the Billboard Country Singles chart.|$|E
5000|$|Pfeuffer's Afghan {{clients are}} Ahsanallah Pirzai and Abdul Ahmad.In October 2005 a US District Court judge in Washington, D.C. {{received}} hand handwritten notes from Pirzai and Ahmad, asserting their innocence. He then assigned {{the two men}} to Pfeuffer.But, as of May 30, 2007, Pfeuffer {{had not been able}} to visit the men, phone them, or write to them.Pfeuffer told The Columbus Dispatch: [...] "I don't know if they <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> exist," ...|$|E
5000|$|... "What's the problem? Is it {{that simple}} that an artist's work is {{determined}} 'an album' or not by someone whom you don't <b>even</b> <b>know?</b> <b>I</b> can unveil {{only a few}} songs after long thoughts and deliberation. Whether it is an LP, tape, CD or USB file is not the point. The {{most important thing is}} not the external packaging, but the fact that my music and songs containing my voice can be played by anyone, anywhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{what makes}} it so strange. We have hardly met for years. Why, he didn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> where <b>I</b> was. The cable was sent to the bank and {{forwarded}} on. And <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> where he is!" ...|$|R
60|$|Then I went foreboding evil, and Guatemoc {{also looked}} downcast. Bitterly did I curse the hour when I {{had said that}} I was of the Spanish blood and yet no Spaniard. Had <b>I</b> <b>known</b> <b>even</b> what <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that day, torture would not have wrung those words from me. But now it was too late.|$|R
6000|$|Owen stared. [...] "To Waterbath? She was to {{have spent}} the night in town, don't you know? But when she left me, after our talk, I said to myself that she would take an <b>evening</b> train. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> made her want to get home." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{typically}} delayed fashion, {{the song}} garnered two nominations for the Grammy Awards of 2009, Best Rock Song and Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance. [...] It won the first, but lost {{the second to}} John Mayer's [...] "Gravity". Springsteen subsequently confessed {{that he had not}} been tracking this closely: [...] "I didn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> was up for a Grammy! I opened the newspaper on Monday and saw that I had won, and thought, 'Well, that's great!'" ...|$|E

5000|$|In 2010 Vachs {{returned}} to performing with {{a starring role}} in Harder by skinworXXX. On her return to performing she commented, [...] "Porn {{is so much more}} widely accepted now than it was 2002. The hardest part of doing porn was how society viewed you. It made it tough sometimes, but now it’s different. My mom didn’t <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> did porn until I stopped performing, but now she knows, in fact I called her today and spoke to her freely about what I was doing." [...] In 2011 she was the co-host for the 2011 XRCO Awards with Tom Byron.|$|E
5000|$|Giuliani's schools chancellor, Rudy Crew, an African-American, later said, [...] "I {{find his}} {{policies}} {{to be so}} racist and class-biased. <b>I</b> don't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> how <b>I</b> lasted three years.... He was barren, completely emotionally barren, {{on the issue of}} race." ...|$|R

5000|$|Up to Arcesilaus, the Platonic Academy {{accepted}} {{the principle of}} finding a general unity in all things, by the aid of which a principle of certainty might be found. Arcesilaus, however, broke new ground by attacking the very possibility of certainty. Socrates had said, [...] "This alone <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> nothing." [...] But Arcesilaus went farther and denied the possibility of even the Socratic minimum of certainty: [...] "I cannot <b>know</b> <b>even</b> whether <b>I</b> <b>know</b> or not." ...|$|R
