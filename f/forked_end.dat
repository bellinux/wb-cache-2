60|$|The real {{object of}} these {{preliminary}} feats, however performed, is, probably, to inspire faith, which Dr. Charcot {{might have done}} by swallowing a cradle. The Indians explain that the barrel staves apparently swallowed are merely dematerialised by 'spirits,' leaving only the <b>forked</b> <b>end</b> {{sticking out of the}} conjurer's mouth.

5000|$|Some {{rear track}} <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> have {{threaded}} devices ("chaintugs") {{to aid in}} setting the proper chain tension. These may be integral to the <b>fork</b> <b>end</b> or separate items. They work by holding the rear axle in an eye {{at the end of}} a threaded bolt. The bolt passes through a cap which fits over the open <b>fork</b> <b>end.</b> Tightening the bolts on each side causes the axle to be pulled backwards towards the open <b>fork</b> <b>end,</b> tensing the chain. Chaintugs can also solve the problem of [...] "axle creep" [...] on hard-ridden fixed-gear bicycles, especially those with hard chromed <b>fork</b> <b>ends,</b> which may not offer adequate grip for the serrated track nuts.|$|R
25|$|The rear {{triangle}} {{connects to}} the rear <b>fork</b> <b>ends,</b> where the rear wheel is attached. It consists of the seat tube and paired chain stays and seat stays.

5000|$|A <b>fork</b> <b>end,</b> [...] fork-end, or forkend is a slot in {{a bicycle}} frame or bicycle fork where the axle of a bicycle wheel is attached. A dropout {{is a type}} of <b>fork</b> <b>end</b> that allows the rear wheel to be removed without first derailing the chain.|$|R
6000|$|In truth, the German was now got to {{a little}} copse-thicket at some {{distance}} from the ruins, where he affected busily to search for such a wand as would suit the purpose of his mystery: and after cutting and examining, and rejecting several, he at length provided himself with a small twig of hazel terminating in a <b>forked</b> <b>end,</b> which he pronounced to possess the virtue proper for the experiment {{that he was about to}} exhibit. Holding the forked ends of the wand, each between a finger and thumb, and thus keeping the rod upright, he proceeded to pace the ruined aisles and cloisters, followed by the rest of the company in admiring procession. [...] "I believe dere was no waters here," [...] said the adept, when he had made the round of several of the buildings, without perceiving any of those indications which he pretended to expect--"I believe those Scotch monksh did find de water too cool for de climate, and alwaysh drank de goot comfortable, Rhinewine. But, aha!--see there!" [...] Accordingly, the assistants observed the rod to turn in his fingers, although he pretended to hold it very tight.--"Dere is water here about, sure enough," [...] and, turning this way and that way, as the agitation of the divining-rod seemed to increase or diminish, he at length advanced into the midst of a vacant and roofless enclosure which had been the kitchen of the priory, when the rod twisted itself so as to point almost straight downwards. [...] "Here is de place," [...] said the adept, [...] "and if you do not find de water here, I will give you all leave to call me an impudent knave." ...|$|E

50|$|In the {{traditional}} form, the hollow {{body of the}} instrument is carved from {{a single piece of}} wood (fir or cedar) around 100 cm long. One end is pointed and the other is forked into two arms which carry a crossbar to hold the tuning mechanism. The soundboard is around 0.5 cm in thickness and covers the whole of the body except the <b>forked</b> <b>end.</b> A bridge is fitted, towards the pointed end of the body. A soundpost is fitted inside the instrument, between the back of the body and the soundboard, to provide support at the position of the bridge. There are typically five strings of tendon or gut. Wood or bone tuning levers are used to tension the strings by pulling them around the crossbar. The strings are tuned diatonically, to a major or minor pentachord. These lyres are also distinguished by the placing of pebbles within the resonating body, causing a rattle. Modern examples may have metal strings, an increased number of strings, tuning pegs or pins, and a body which lacks the <b>forked</b> <b>end.</b>|$|E
50|$|The ripe fruits are {{harvested}} by climbing {{the tree and}} plucking by hand, alternatively a long stick with a <b>forked</b> <b>end</b> {{may be used to}} twist the fruits off.

Some soft cheese knives also include a ridge, which runs vertically {{near the top of the}} blade. This helps separate the cheese as it is being sliced. Some cheese knives have a <b>forked</b> <b>end</b> and is used for serving slices of cheese.|$|E

50|$|The {{use of a}} furca by {{soldiers}} was established by Marius. The furca is a stick with a <b>forked</b> <b>end</b> that allowed the soldier to more easily carry around his equipment. Within a pack tied {{at the end of}} the furca, the soldier would most likely carry his sagum, a cloak that acted as a blanket, a kettle or pot, replacement straps, shaving items, and rations. Once packed, the furca was slung over the shield and fastened to their back, inspiring the nickname “Marius’ Mules”. The result of implementing this method of individually carrying weight allowed Marius to reduce the amount of wagons, animals, and slaves that must be brought on army trains.|$|E

50|$|Bicycle forks {{usually have}} an offset, or rake (not to be {{confused}} with a different use of the word rake in the motorcycle world), that places the <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> forward of the steering axis. This is achieved by curving the blades forward, angling straight blades forward, or by placing the <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> forward of the centerline of the blades. The latter is used in suspension forks that must have straight blades in order for the suspension mechanism to work. Curved fork blades can also provide some shock absorption.|$|R

50|$|The {{overall size}} varies between species from 30 cm tall up to 2 m tall. The leaves are entire, {{opposite}} and decussate (each leaf pair {{at right angles}} to the next) and rugose or reticulate veined. The bracts (floral leaves) are similar or different from the lower leaves. All parts are frequently covered with hairs. The bracteoles are ovate, lanceolate or linear. The flowers are arranged in whorls called verticillasters which encircle the stems. The stems are usually square in section with rounded corners, although tomentum on the stems can make them appear circular. The colour of the flowers varies from yellow to pink, purple and white. The calyx is tubular or campanulate with five or ten veins visible. Five teeth, either all equal or with the outer two longer than the others. The upper lip is hood shaped and laterally compressed (P. tuberosa, however, has an uncompressed lip with a dense bearded edge). The lower lip is trifid, the central lobe being larger than the lateral ones. There are four stamens ascending under the upper lip. Anther with <b>forked</b> <b>end,</b> the upper fork being shorter than the lower. The fruits are four three-sided, nutlets, and sometimes topped with hair, sometimes glabrous. The root system can be very extensive; roots of 6-week-old seedlings have been measured at 0.7 m.|$|E
40|$|Phage T 5 {{exonuclease}} is a 5 ' [...] > 3 'exodeoxyribonuclease {{that also}} exhibits endonucleolytic activity on flap structures (branched duplex DNA containing a free single-stranded 5 '-end). Oligonucleotides {{were used to}} construct duplexes with either blunt ends, 5 '-overhangs, 3 '-overhangs, a flap or a <b>forked</b> <b>end</b> (pseudo-Y). The binding of T 5 exonuclease to various structures was investigated using native electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) {{in the absence of}} the essential divalent metal cofactor. Binding of T 5 exonuclease to either blunt-ended duplexes or single-stranded oligonucleotides could not be detected by EMSA. However, duplexes with 5 '-overhangs, flaps and pseudo-Y structures showed decreased mobility with added T 5 exonuclease. On binding to DNA the wild-type enzyme was rendered partially resistant to proteolysis, yielding a biologically active 31. 5 kDa fragment. However, the protein-DNA complex remained susceptible to inactivation by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate (PHMB, a cysteine-specific modifying agent), suggesting that neither cysteine is intimately associated with substrate binding. Replacement of both cysteine residues of the molecule with serine did not greatly alter the catalytic or binding characteristics of the protein but did render it highly resistant to inhibition by PHMB...|$|E

40|$|RecD 2 from Deinococcus radiodurans is a {{superfamily}} 1 DNA helicase that is homologous to the Escherichia coli RecD protein but functions {{outside the}} context of RecBCD enzyme. We report here on the kinetics of DNA unwinding by RecD 2 under single and multiple turnover conditions. There is little unwinding of 20 -bp substrates by preformed RecD 2 -dsDNA complexes when excess ssDNA is present to trap enzyme molecules not bound to the substrate. A shorter 12 -bp substrate is unwound rapidly under single turnover conditions. The 12 -bp unwinding reaction could be simulated with a mechanism in which the DNA is unwound in two kinetic steps with rate constant of kunw = 5. 5 s− 1 and a dissociation step from partially unwound DNA of koff = 1. 9 s− 1. These results indicate a kinetic step size of about 3 – 4 bp, unwinding rate of about 15 – 20 bp/s, and low processivity (p = 0. 74). The reaction time courses with 20 -bp substrates, determined under multiple turnover conditions, could be simulated with a four-step mechanism and rate constant values {{very similar to those}} for the 12 -bp substrate. The results indicate that the faster unwinding of a DNA substrate with a <b>forked</b> <b>end</b> versus only a 5 ′-terminal single-stranded extension can be accounted for by a difference in the rate of enzyme binding to the DNA substrates. Analysis of reactions done with different RecD 2 concentrations indicates that the enzyme forms an inactive dimer or other oligomer at high enzyme concentrations. RecD 2 oligomers can be detected by glutaraldehyde cross-linking but not by size exclusion chromatography...|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the dangers}} {{inherent}} in slingshots is the high probability that the bands will fail. Most bands are made from latex, which degrades with time and use, causing the bands to eventually fail under load. [...] Failures at the pouch end are safest, as they result in the band rebounding away from the user. Failures at the <b>fork</b> <b>end,</b> however, send the band back towards the shooter's face, which can cause eye and facial injuries. [...] One method to minimize {{the chance of a}} <b>fork</b> <b>end</b> failure is to utilize a tapered band, thinner at the pouch end, and thicker and stronger at the <b>fork</b> <b>end.</b> [...] Designs that use loose parts at the fork are the most dangerous, as they can result in those parts being propelled back towards the shooter's face, such as the ball attachment used in the recalled Daisy [...] "Natural" [...] line of slingshots (see image). The band could slip out of the slot in which it rested, and the hard ball in the tube resulted in cases of blindness and broken teeth. Daisy models using plain tubular bands were not covered in the recall, because the elastic tubing does not cause severe injuries upon failure.|$|R
