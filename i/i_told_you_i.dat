25|$|In 1975 Milligan fathered a son, James (born June 1976), in {{an affair}} with Margaret Maughan. Another child, a {{daughter}} Romany, is suspected {{to have been born}} at the same time, to a Canadian journalist named Roberta Watt. His last wife was Shelagh Sinclair, to whom he was married from 1983 to his death on 27 February 2002. Four of his children collaborated with documentary makers on a multi-platform programme called <b>I</b> <b>Told</b> <b>You</b> <b>I</b> Was Ill: The Life and Legacy of Spike Milligan (2005), which then included an accompanying website (www.spikemilliganlegacy.com).|$|E

60|$|Don Felix. When thou didst reject my suit, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>thee</b> <b>I</b> {{would be}} revenged; I said a day would come when thou, so cold and haughty then, would kneel to me imploring mercy and <b>I</b> would deny <b>thee.</b> That time hath come, and I am deaf to all thy prayers.|$|R
500|$|... "The New Cup" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics, with many noting {{that both the}} episode's plot and songs were particularly strong. According to Nielsen Media Research, on its initial broadcast, [...] "The New Cup" [...] was watched by over 500,000 people. Two songs from the episode, [...] "Sugalumps" [...] and [...] "You Don't Have to be a Prostitute", received positive critical acclaim and were later included on the band's second album <b>I</b> <b>Told</b> <b>You</b> <b>I</b> Was Freaky.|$|E
2500|$|It was reputedly {{invented by}} the Australian leg-spinner Clarrie Grimmett. Grimmet became so enamoured with the {{delivery}} {{that at times}} he bowled it almost as frequently as his stock leg break. The great Don Bradman once remarked to Grimmett {{that he must have}} forgotten how to bowl a leg break, as he bowled so many flippers. Ironically, Bradman was bowled shortly thereafter at a memorial match by Grimmett who produced a perfectly pitched stock ball that turned just enough to remove Bradman's off bail. [...] "There y'are Don, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> could bowl a leg break" [...] was Grimmett's alleged response.|$|E
2500|$|Mauer {{finished}} the 2006 regular {{season with a}} [...]347 batting average, edging the New York Yankees' Derek Jeter and Robinson Canó to win the American League batting title and become the first-ever American League catcher to win the crown and the first catcher to claim the title since Ernie Lombardi in 1942 with the Boston Braves. [...] His [...]347 average was {{the highest in the}} Major Leagues, a feat not achieved by the previous three catchers to win NL batting titles. He was the youngest player to win a batting title since Alex Rodriguez in 1996. After going 2-for-4 in the last game of the 2006 regular season, Mauer confessed to reporters, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> wasn’t thinking about the batting title? [...] I was lying. [...] I’ve never been that nervous in my life. [...] I haven’t felt anything like that since Opening Day as a rookie." [...] Mauer won his first Silver Slugger Award in 2006, along with teammate Justin Morneau.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Alack, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>thee</b> <b>I</b> am no priest,' {{said the}} hermit; 'but for such as I am, <b>I</b> bless <b>thee</b> {{with all my}} soul, thou fatherless lad,' and he laid {{his hand on the}} young lad's {{wondering}} brow, then bade him begone, since Simon and himself had much to say to one another.|$|R

2500|$|... "First, I {{want to let}} {{you know}} that I came to join the revolution, not to kill the Cambodian people. Look at me now. Do you think ... am I a violent person? No. So, as far as my {{conscience}} and my mission were concerned, there was no problem. This needs to be clarified...My experience was the same as that of my movement. We were new and inexperienced and events kept occurring one after the other which we had to deal with. In doing that, we made mistakes as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> admit it now and I admitted it in the notes I have written. Whoever wishes to blame or attack me is entitled to do so. I regret I didn't have enough experience to totally control the movement. On the other hand, with our constant struggle, this had to be done together with others in the communist world to stop Kampuchea becoming Vietnamese. For the love of the nation and the people it was the right thing to do but in the course of our actions we made mistakes." ...|$|E

Sleep well, and recover {{in spite of the}} leeches. I cannot afford to lose both of you." ...|$|R
