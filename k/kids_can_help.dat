50|$|The kids of South Park, Colorado {{argue about}} a new game for them to play. Cartman dressed as a Sheriff decides the kids should play Cowboys and Indians. The kids {{initially}} seem reluctant until Cartman suggests the New <b>Kid</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> the Cowboys win the game. Using FaceTime to contact the New Kid, he invites them to come and play by means of using their smartphone which he dubs as a powerful weapon, that can assure their victory.|$|R
50|$|Rewards don't {{have to be}} very elaborate, but can be simple. It's best if {{rewards are}} given right away as {{stickers}} should be given right away, so that the child knows what the reward is for exactly. The goal of the reward is to keep the child continuing this behavior or skill. Dr. Virginia Shiller, a psychologist and instructor at the Yale Child Study Center and coauthor of the book Rewards for <b>Kids,</b> rewards <b>can</b> <b>help</b> parents teach their children new habits. Shiller says the key is in how the incentives are given; in setting appropriate, realistic goals; and in figuring out a strategy to achieve them.|$|R

500|$|<b>Kids</b> <b>Can</b> Say No! resurfaced in 2014, when Harris was {{prosecuted for}} twelve counts of indecently assaulting young girls. The {{prosecutors}} found <b>Kids</b> <b>Can</b> Say No! on YouTube {{and wanted to}} show it at trial to illustrate its unintentional irony, but the film was not admitted as evidence. Harris {{was found guilty of}} all counts. During the trial, it was learned that, while Harris was filming <b>Kids</b> <b>Can</b> Say No!, he {{was in the midst of}} a casual sexual relationship with his daughter Bindi's best friend and, by its release, he had committed nine of the twelve assaults. According to Richard Guilliatt and Jacquelin Magnay in an article in The Australian, Harris' campaign against paedophilia in <b>Kids</b> <b>Can</b> Say No! can [...] "be seen in retrospect as either monumental self-delusion or a sign of deep, self-lacerating guilt".|$|R

Jealousy ensues, and the dog decides to pretend to be a cat in order to enter and win the contest. Reviewer Cindy Donnelly writes, [...] "Any parent of a budding 'star' knows that <b>kids</b> <b>can</b> get excited about winning, and sometimes they get frustrated if they are not the best singer, dancer, speller etc. This book <b>can</b> <b>help</b> them cope with the possibility of not being first place and being happy with who they are and the talents they possess." ...|$|R
