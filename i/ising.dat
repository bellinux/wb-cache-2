5|$|In 1950, Ward's DSIR {{fellowship}} {{was coming}} to an end. Pryce had become a visiting professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and Ward's colleagues P. T. Matthews and Abdus Salam were visiting members there in the 1950–1951 academic year. Through them, he was able to secure a $3,000 membership for the 1951–1952 academic year. It was at Princeton that he was introduced to the <b>Ising</b> Model, and met Mark Kac from Cornell University, with whom he would collaborate on an exact solution of the <b>Ising</b> model using a combinatorial method. His joint work with Kac on the <b>Ising</b> Model gave rise to what is now being called the Kac-Ward operator. When his membership ended he worked for the Bell Laboratories in 1952 and 1953. He then accepted an offer of a lectureship at the University of Adelaide from Bert Green, where he worked for a year before taking up another membership at the Institute for Advanced Study.|$|E
5|$|Magnetism as a {{property}} of matter {{has been known}} in China since 4000 BC. However, the first modern studies of magnetism only started {{with the development of}} electrodynamics by Faraday, Maxwell and others in the nineteenth century, which included classifying materials as ferromagnetic, paramagnetic and diamagnetic based on their response to magnetization. Pierre Curie studied the dependence of magnetization on temperature and discovered the Curie point phase transition in ferromagnetic materials. In 1906, Pierre Weiss introduced the concept of magnetic domains to explain the main properties of ferromagnets. The first attempt at a microscopic description of magnetism was by Wilhelm Lenz and Ernst <b>Ising</b> through the <b>Ising</b> model that described magnetic materials as consisting of a periodic lattice of spins that collectively acquired magnetization. The <b>Ising</b> model was solved exactly to show that spontaneous magnetization cannot occur in one dimension but is possible in higher-dimensional lattices. Further research such as by Bloch on spin waves and Néel on antiferromagnetism led to developing new magnetic materials with applications to magnetic storage devices.|$|E
5|$|The {{contributions}} of Salam and Ward to the Standard Model {{were used in}} the development of the theoretical structure of the Higgs boson.

5|$|After {{dropping}} out of college, Hanna worked briefly as a construction engineer and helped build the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood. He lost that job during the Great Depression and found another at a car wash. His sister's boyfriend encouraged him {{to apply for a}} job at Pacific Title and Art, which produced title cards for motion pictures. While working there, Hanna's talent for drawing became evident, and in 1930 he joined the Harman and <b>Ising</b> animation studio, which had created the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series. Despite a lack of formal training, Hanna soon became head of their ink and paint department. Besides inking and painting, Hanna also wrote songs and lyrics. For the first several years of Hanna's employment, the studio partnered with Pacific Title and Art's Leon Schlesinger, who released the Harman-Ising output through Warner Bros. When Hugh Harman and Rudolph <b>Ising</b> chose to break with Schlesinger and begin producing cartoons independently for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1933, Hanna was one of the employees who followed them.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, Hanna and Barbera jointly {{directed}} Puss Gets the Boot, {{which was}} nominated for an Academy Award for Best (Cartoon) Short Subject. The studio wanted a diversified cartoon portfolio, so despite the success of Puss Gets the Boot, Barbera and Hanna's supervisor, Fred Quimby, {{did not want to}} produce more cat and mouse cartoons believing that there were already enough cartoons of those in existence. Surprised by the success of Puss Gets the Boot, Barbera and Hanna ignored Quimby's resistance and continued developing the cat-and-mouse theme. By this time, however, Hanna wanted to return to working for <b>Ising,</b> to whom he felt very loyal. Barbera and Hanna met with Quimby, who discovered that although <b>Ising</b> had taken sole credit for producing Puss Gets the Boot, he never actually worked on it. Quimby then gave Hanna and Barbera permission to pursue their cat-and-mouse idea. The result was their most famous creation, Tom and Jerry.|$|E

40|$|The {{combined}} {{effect of}} green tea ingestion and interval sprinting exercise on body and abdominal fat of overweight males was investigated. Participants {{were randomly assigned}} into control (C), green tea (GT), interval sprinting exercise (<b>ISE),</b> and green tea and <b>ISE</b> (GT + <b>ISE)</b> groups. The GT, GT + <b>ISE,</b> and C groups consumed three GT capsules daily. The <b>ISE</b> and GT + <b>ISE</b> groups completed 36 <b>ISE</b> sessions over 12 weeks. Forty eight overweight males with a mean BMI of 28. 5 ± 0. 92 kg/m 2 and age of 26 ± 0. 7 years acted as participants. There was {{a significant reduction in}} total and abdominal fat mass for the <b>ISE</b> and GT + <b>ISE</b> groups, p < 0. 05, however, total and abdominal fat mass did not significantly change in the GT and C groups. There was a significant increase in total lean mass, p < 0. 05, after the intervention for the <b>ISE</b> and GT + <b>ISE</b> groups only. There was a significant increase in fat oxidation during submaximal aerobic exercise, p < 0. 05, after the intervention for the <b>ISE,</b> GT + <b>ISE,</b> and GT groups with no change for the C group. Following the 12 -week intervention the <b>ISE</b> and GT + <b>ISE</b> groups, compared to C, recorded a significantly greater decrease in body and abdominal fat, and a significant increase in total lean mass. Ingestion of green tea by itself, however, did not result in a significant decrease in body or abdominal fat, but increased fat utilization during submaximal exercise. The combination of 12 weeks of GT ingestion and <b>ISE</b> did not result in greater total and abdominal fat reduction compared to 12 weeks of <b>ISE</b> alone...|$|R

Quantum cellular automata, one way of performing computations using the principles of quantum mechanics, are often required to be reversible.

5|$|In February 1928, Disney {{hoped to}} {{negotiate}} a larger fee for producing the Oswald series, but found Mintz wanting to reduce the payments. Mintz had also persuaded many of the artists involved to work directly for him, including Harman, <b>Ising,</b> Carman Maxwell and Friz Freleng. Disney also found out that Universal owned the intellectual property rights to Oswald. Mintz threatened {{to start his own}} studio and produce the series himself if Disney refused to accept the reductions. Disney declined Mintz's ultimatum and lost most of his animation staff, except Iwerks, who chose to remain with him.|$|E

40|$|SummaryPlasmodesmata (PD) {{transport}} developmentally important {{nucleic acids}} and proteins between plant cells [1 – 3]. Primary PD form during cell division and are simple, linear channels [4, 5]. Secondary PD form in existing cell walls after cell division and are simple, twinned, or branched [4]. PD function undergoes a marked reduction at the mid-torpedo stage of Arabidopsis embryogenesis [6]. Two mutants, increased size exclusion limit (<b>ise)</b> 1 and <b>ise</b> 2, fail to undergo this transition, and their null mutations are embryonically lethal [7,  8]. We investigated the ultrastructure of PD in early-, mid-, and late-torpedo-stage embryos and in young leaves. Wild-type (WT) embryos contain twinned and branched (T/B) PD at all stages, but <b>ise</b> 1 and <b>ise</b> 2 embryos contain significantly higher proportions of T/B PD than WT embryos. WT T/B PD formation {{occurs in a}} stage- and tissue-specific pattern that is reversed in <b>ise</b> 1 embryos. Silencing <b>ISE</b> 1 in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves increases the frequency of secondary PD in existing cell walls. Silencing <b>ISE</b> 2 increases the proportion of T/B secondary PD formed. Silenced tissues exhibit increased PD-mediated movement of green fluorescent protein tracers. Thus, silencing of <b>ISE</b> 1 and <b>ISE</b> 2 phenocopies <b>ise</b> 1 and <b>ise</b> 2 mutant embryos: when wild-type <b>ISE</b> 1 and <b>ISE</b> 2 functions are lost, de novo production of PD occurs, leading to increased intercellular transport...|$|R
5|$|Quimby {{accepted}} each Academy Award for Tom and Jerry's without inviting Hanna and Barbera onstage. The cartoons {{were also}} released with Quimby {{listed as the}} sole producer, following the same practice {{for which he had}} condemned <b>Ising.</b> When Quimby retired in late 1955, Hanna and Barbera were placed in charge of MGM's animation division. As the studio began to lose more revenue due to television, MGM soon realized that re-releasing old cartoons was far more profitable than producing new ones. In 1957, MGM ordered Hanna and Barbera's business manager to close the cartoon division and lay off everyone by a phone call. Hanna and Barbera found the no-notice closing puzzling because Tom and Jerry had been so successful.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Ising</b> {{model is}} used to model the {{behavior}} of magnetic systems. It consists of an array of cells, the state of each of which represents a spin, either up or down. The energy {{of the system is}} measured by a function that depends on the number of neighboring pairs of cells that have the same spin as each other. Therefore, if a cell has equal numbers of neighbors in the two states, it may flip its own state without changing the total energy. However, such a flip is energy-conserving only if no two adjacent cells flip at the same time.|$|E
5|$|After working {{odd jobs}} in {{the first months of}} the Great Depression, Hanna joined the Harman and <b>Ising</b> {{animation}} studio in 1930. During the 1930s, Hanna steadily gained skill and prominence while working on cartoons such as Captain and the Kids. In 1937, while working at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Hanna met Joseph Barbera. The two men began a collaboration that was at first best known for producing Tom and Jerry and live action/animated hybrid films. In 1957, they co-founded Hanna-Barbera, which became the most successful television animation studio in the business, producing programs such as The Flintstones, The Huckleberry Hound Show, The Jetsons, Scooby-Doo, The Smurfs, and Yogi Bear. In 1967, Hanna-Barbera was sold to Taft Broadcasting for $12million, but Hanna and Barbera remained heads of the company until 1991. At that time, the studio was sold to Turner Broadcasting System, which in turn was merged with Time Warner in 1996; Hanna and Barbera stayed on as advisors.|$|E
