25|$|Sweet soon {{learns that}} Big Smoke is <b>holed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{fortified}} crack den in the city, {{and he and}} CJ go there to confront him. CJ enters the building alone, fighting {{his way to the}} top floor and confronting Smoke. CJ attempts to reason with Big Smoke, but the latter engages CJ in a gunfight. CJ defeats him and Big Smoke confesses that he betrayed the GSF in order to gain more power and money, and dies shortly after from his injuries. Just then, Tenpenny appears, holds CJ at gunpoint and steals Big Smoke's money, intending to use it to leave the city. Tenpenny escapes and CJ and Sweet pursue him. During the pursuit, Tenpenny loses control of a fire truck that he was using as a getaway vehicle, driving off the bridge over the Grove Street cul-de-sac and crashing at the entrance to it. CJ and his friends watch as a fatally wounded Tenpenny crawls from the wreckage and dies.|$|E
25|$|Casaubon escapes {{the museum}} through the Paris sewers, {{eventually}} fleeing {{to the countryside}} villa where Belbo had grown up. It is unclear by this point how reliable a narrator Casaubon has been, {{and to what extent}} he has been inventing, or deceived by, conspiracy theories. Casaubon soon learns that Diotallevi succumbed to his cancer at midnight on St. John's Eve, coincidentally the same time Belbo died. The novel ends with Casaubon meditating on the events of the book, apparently resigned to the (possibly delusional) idea that the Tres will capture him soon. And when they do, he will follow Belbo's lead, refusing to give them any clues, refusing to create a lie. While waiting, <b>holed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> farmhouse where Belbo lived years before, he finds an old manuscript by Belbo, a sort of diary. He discovers that Belbo had a mystical experience at the age of twelve, in which he perceived ultimate meaning beyond signs and semiotics. He realizes that much of Belbo's behavior and possibly his creation of the Plan and even his death was inspired by Belbo's desire to recapture that lost meaning.|$|E

25|$|The Journal {{claims to}} have sent the first news report, on the Dow Jones wire, of a plane {{crashing}} into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Its headquarters, at One World Financial Center, was severely damaged {{by the collapse of}} the World Trade Center just across the street. Top editors worried that they might miss publishing the first issue {{for the first time in}} the paper's 112-year history. They relocated to a makeshift office at an editor's home, while sending most of the staff to Dow Jones's South Brunswick, N.J., corporate campus, where the paper had established emergency editorial facilities soon after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The paper was on the stands the next day, albeit in scaled-down form. Perhaps the most compelling story in that day's edition was a first-hand account of the Twin Towers' collapse written by then-Foreign Editor (and current Washington bureau chief) John Bussey, who <b>holed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ninth-floor Journal office, literally in the shadow of the towers, from where he phoned in live reports to CNBC as the towers burned. He narrowly escaped serious injury when the first tower collapsed, shattering all the windows in the Journal offices and filling them with dust and debris. The Journal won a 2002 Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News Reporting for that day's stories.|$|E

500|$|Despite not {{charting}} {{in mainland}} Europe, and not selling very well initially, The Holy Bible received significant critical acclaim {{when it was}} released in August 1994, and in the years following. Simon Williams of NME saw The Holy Bible as primarily the work of James Dean Bradfield, saying [...] "The Holy Bible isn't elegant, but it is bloody effective". Melody Maker, seeing it as primarily the work of Richey Edwards, described it as [...] "the sound of a group in extremis [...] hurtling towards a private armageddon". Observed Roy Wilkinson in Select: [...] "Amid all the references to coma, carcasses, 'walking abortions' and dying in the summer sits the spectre of Richey, <b>holed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> private clinic, having drunk too much, eaten too little and cut himself for reasons varying between dramatic gesture, a surrogate for screaming out loud and something 'sexual' [...] Let's hope that, {{with a record of}} such unsettling, morbid resonance as The Holy Bible, no further gestures are required." ...|$|E

2500|$|As Bob Bows observes in {{his review}} of the 2008 Germinal Stage Denver production, whereas at first [...] "'The Birthday Party' {{appears to be a}} {{straightforward}} story of a former working pianist now <b>holed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> decrepit boarding house," [...] in this play as in his other plays, [...] "behind the surface symbolism ... in the silence between the characters and their words, Pinter opens the door to another world, cogent and familiar: the part we hide from ourselves"; ultimately, [...] "Whether we take Goldberg and McCann to be the devil and his agent or simply their earthly emissaries, the puppeteers of the church-state apparatus, or some variation thereof, Pinter's metaphor of a bizarre party bookended by birth and death is a compelling take on this blink-of-an-eye we call life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Critics have {{objected to}} the show's usage of {{violence}} by dressing it with pretty photography. Others complained that the show relied more on visual aspects and music than on coherent stories and fully drawn characters. Civic leaders in Miami have also {{objected to the}} show's airing of the city's crime problems all across America. Most civic leaders, however, have been placated due to the show's estimated contribution of $1 million per episode to the city's economy and boosting tourism to Miami. Gerald S. Arenberg of the National Association of Chiefs of Police criticized the show's glamorous depiction of vice squads, saying [...] "no real vice cops chase drug dealers in a Ferrari while wearing $600 suits. More often than not, they're <b>holed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> crummy room somewhere, wearing jeans with holes in them, watching some beat-up warehouse in a godforsaken part of town through a pair of dented binoculars".|$|E
