5|$|A {{habitat is}} an {{ecological}} or environmental {{area that is}} inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{frequently}} secrete chemicals {{into their}} <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> order to modify it favourably. The secretions are often proteins and may act as enzymes that digest {{some form of}} food in the environment.|$|E

5|$|Caldwell {{is perhaps}} best {{known as one of}} the {{principal}} architects of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the first act of its kind in the world, signed into law on January 1, 1970. In drafting A National Policy on the <b>Environment</b> <b>in</b> 1968 as consultant to Senator Henry Jackson, the head of the powerful Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Committee, Caldwell realized that more was needed than a mere a policy statement: an “action-forcing mechanism” would be necessary to secure federal agency compliance with the Act’s requirements. The origin of the requirement for preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) has been attributed to Caldwell, whose testimony at the Senate hearing in April 1969 laid the groundwork for inclusion of provisions requiring an evaluation of the effects of all major federal projects significantly affecting the quality of the human <b>environment.</b> <b>In</b> these “detailed statements,” as they were termed in the Act, all reasonably foreseeable social, economic, and environmental effects of a proposed action and any possible alternatives to it must be identified and assessed before any federal action takes place.|$|E
5|$|Experiments into behavior, to {{understand}} how organisms detect and {{interact with each other}} and their <b>environment,</b> <b>in</b> which fruit flies, worms, mice, and rats are all widely used. Studies of brain function, such as memory and social behavior, often use rats and birds. For some species, behavioral research is combined with enrichment strategies for animals in captivity because it allows them to engage in a wider range of activities.|$|E

5|$|From 1978, {{the rate}} of {{exchange}} depreciation was fixed with a tablita, an active crawling peg {{that was based on}} a timetable to announce a gradually-declining rate of depreciation. The announcements were repeated on a rolling basis to create an <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> which economic agents could discern a government commitment to deflation. Inflation gradually fell throughout 1980 to below 100%.|$|E
5|$|ILM created 527 {{shots for}} the film, using {{programs}} such as Maya. Perception worked on over 125 shots for the film. They crafted gadgets, such as Tony Stark's transparent LG smartphone, and created the backdrops for the Stark Expo {{as well as the}} computer screen interfaces on the touch-screen coffee table and the holographic lab <b>environment.</b> <b>In</b> total, 11 visual effect studios worked on the film.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, {{graduates}} of state-run Shinto schools, such as Kokugakuin University and Kougakkan University, were implicitly allowed to become public school teachers. A {{greater number of}} better-trained priests with educations at state-supported schools, combined with a rising patriotic fervor, is believed by some to have seeded an <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> which grassroots Emperor worship was possible, even without financial support for local shrines.|$|E

5|$|In 1998 {{the festival}} {{was once again}} struck with severe floods and storms, and again some festival goers {{departed}} early – but those who stayed were treated to performances from acts such as Pulp, Robbie Williams and Blur.

5|$|In 2001, a team {{continued}} {{the study of}} the gas phase chemistry of seaborgium by reacting the element with O2 in a H2O <b>environment.</b> <b>In</b> a manner similar to the formation of the oxychloride, the results of the experiment indicated the formation of seaborgium oxide hydroxide, a reaction well known among the lighter group 6 homologues as well as the pseudohomologue uranium.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 the Land Transport Authority began {{exploring}} {{the potential of}} Global Navigation Satellite System as a technological option for a second generation ERP.
