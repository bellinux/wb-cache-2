2500|$|Rachel Coleman as Rachel, {{the host}} of the Signing Time! series. She has spent much of her adult life in the {{entertainment}} industry. While performing with her band We the Living, Rachel’s 14-month-old daughter Leah, was diagnosed as having a profound hearing impairment. [...] “When <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>my</b> daughter was deaf, I could not find a way to rationalize spending hours working on my music. My priorities changed. I put down my guitar and picked up sign language.” ...|$|E
2500|$|However, Ellis, {{releasing}} a letter Monday evening {{that he sent}} Saturday to county Chief Operating Officer Robert W. Graf, denies violating the agreement. The letter, in part, states: [...] "As for Ms. Bradley and myself, that case was amicably closed April 1 and never violated by either party. As I told Ms. Jackson, I did mistakenly dial Ms. Bradley on her cell when trying to call someone with a very close number and I dialed too quickly...after four years, {{it was an old}} habit. Nothing was said and I immediately hung up when <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>my</b> mistake. That happened one time in a month. I have said nothing to Ms. Bradley nor seen her in or out of the county workplace." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eggleston's early {{photographic}} {{efforts were}} inspired {{by the work of}} Swiss-born photographer Robert Frank, and by French photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson's book, The Decisive Moment. Eggleston later recalled that the book was [...] "the first serious book I found, from many awful books...I didn't understand it a bit, and then it sank in, and <b>I</b> <b>realized,</b> <b>my</b> God, this is a great one.” First photographing in black-and-white, Eggleston began experimenting with color in 1965 and 1966 after being introduced to the medium by William Christenberry. [...] Color transparency film became his dominant medium in the later 1960s. Eggleston's development as a photographer seems to have taken place in relative isolation from other artists. In an interview with Director of Photography at New York's Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) John Szarkowski describes his first encounter with the young Eggleston in 1969 as being [...] "absolutely out of the blue". After reviewing Eggleston's work (which he recalled as a suitcase full of [...] "drugstore" [...] color prints) Szarkowski prevailed upon the Photography Committee of MoMA to buy one of Eggleston's photographs.|$|E

6000|$|... "Instead {{of which}} I laid myself bare," [...] I cried bitterly, [...] "and {{at the same}} time was {{suspicious}} of that lad, Seth Jepson. Not until he admitted getting information concerning Archie from Amos Nelson, did <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>my</b> mistake." ...|$|R
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that <b>my</b> pursuers {{had closed}} in on me. I was {{surrounded}} on all sides.|$|R
60|$|These {{were growing}} days! I had moments of {{tremendous}} expansion, hours when my mind went {{out over the}} earth like a freed eagle, but these flights were always succeeded by fits of depression as <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>my</b> weakness and my poverty. Nevertheless I persisted in my studies.|$|E
60|$|Even now I fail to {{understand}} why my wits had so completely deserted me. I had no thought {{of what might be}} the result if we two made off into the forest in the darkness; but before we met Simon Kenton again <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>my</b> folly most keenly.|$|E
60|$|M. de la Feste came slowly back; as {{he stepped}} in beside me <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>my</b> {{position}} so vividly that my heart might almost have been heard to beat. The third condition had arisen--the least expected by either of us. She had refused him; {{he was free to}} claim me.|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>my</b> entire {{youth and}} early {{writings}} {{had all been}} nurtured in hatred, violence and arrogance, or lies, cynicism and sarcasm. I knew {{at that time that}} Mao-style thinking and Cultural Revolution-style language had become ingrained in me, and my goal had been to transform myself .... It may take me a lifetime {{to get rid of the}} poison.|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on summer {{programmes}} for field trips for primary school pupils. The theoretical part of the thesis contains important information about the organisation of the field trips and ideas for activities for this stay. In the practical part, I find out whether schools in the Czech Republic organize the field trips and {{the way of the}} realization. Then, in the practical part, <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>my</b> own one-week project...|$|R
60|$|I {{staggered}} {{to my feet}} again, more amused than {{alarmed by}} my adventure. The candle had fallen from my hand, and {{was lost in the}} stream, but I had two others in my pocket, so that it was of no importance. I got one of them ready, and drew out my box of matches to light it. Only then did <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>my</b> position. The box had been soaked in my fall into the river. It was impossible to strike the matches.|$|R
6000|$|... "They went up together, {{leaving me}} below. To my {{surprise}} and consternation, {{as they reached}} the top of the cellar stairs, I saw the General swing the door shut and heard a key turn in the lock. I rushed to the top of the stairs and tried in vain to open the door. I was trapped. In a moment <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>my</b> folly in trusting myself in the hands of these people.|$|E
60|$|Gratefully {{sinking into}} a chair by the window, I fell into study of the people {{streaming}} by, and a chilling sense of helplessness fell upon me. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>my</b> ignorance, my feebleness. As a minute bubble in this torrent of human life, with no friend in whom I could put trust, and with {{only a handful of}} silver between myself and the gray wolf, I lost confidence. The Boston trip seemed a foolish tempting of Providence and yet, scared as I was, I had no real intention of giving it up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sometimes I think I {{might have}} tried harder," [...] she said. [...] "At least I might have {{understood}} better. I was stupid. But everything went wrong. And I saw you growing {{away from me}} all the time, Hugh, growing away from the friends who were fond of you, as though you were fading in the distance. It wasn't wholly because--because of Nancy that I left you. That gave me an excuse--an excuse for myself. Long before that <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>my</b> helplessness, I knew that whatever I might have done was past doing." ...|$|E
60|$|With a sigh <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that <b>my</b> journey thither was {{a useless}} one. Nothing {{remained}} {{but to go}} back to the road, and I was about to leave again when the rays of the lantern fell upon a white object lying on the floor.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{looks into}} the complex issue of CRM implementation. The thesis is divided into a {{theoretical}} and practical part. The {{first part of the}} thesis aims at analyzing CRM system, defining it's essential features and also investigating influence of the system implementation. The main goal of {{the second part of the}} thesis is to analyze two Russian companies, which have implemented the CRM system or a part of them. In this part I have performed own research and on the basis of investigation <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>my</b> own measurements of effectiveness of implementation. In the conclusion, I have summarized main results of the implementation and suggest some own ideas for company business development...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course <b>I</b> now <b>realize</b> <b>my</b> mistake; and <b>I</b> have apologized-- apologized humbly--dash it! But at {{the moment}} I was firmly under the {{impression}} that our friend here had an attack of some kind and was about to inflict injuries on Miss Peters. If I've seen it happen once in India, I've seen it happen a dozen times.|$|R
60|$|A cold hand {{seemed to}} close round my heart as <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>my</b> position. The {{darkness}} was opaque and horrible. It was so utter one put one's {{hand up to}} one's face as if to press off something solid. I stood still, and by an effort I steadied myself. I tried to reconstruct in my mind {{a map of the}} floor of the cavern as I had last seen it. Alas! the bearings which had impressed themselves upon my mind were high on the wall, and not to be found by touch. Still, I remembered in a general way how the sides were situated, and I hoped that by groping my way along them I should at last come to the opening of the Roman tunnel. Moving very slowly, and continually striking against the rocks, I set out on this desperate quest.|$|E
6000|$|The {{following}} day he watched while the carpenter and I worked at putting my study into shape. Ever since the fire {{two years before}} its ceiling had needed repair, and even now I was but half-hearted in its restoration. As I looked around the square, bare, ugly room and thought of the spacious libraries of Longfellow, Lowell and Holmes, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>my</b> almost hopeless situation. I was only a literary camper after all. My life was not here--it couldn't be here so far from all that makes a writer's life worth while. [...] "Soon {{for the sake of}} the children I must take them from this pleasant rut," [...] I said to Zulime. [...] "It is true an author can make himself felt from any place, but why do it at a disadvantage? If it were not for Father, I would establish our winter home in New York, which has the effect of increasing my power as well as my happiness." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{daylight}} we {{were all}} up, cramped, stiff, half frozen, mostly silent. The water left in the buckets was solid ice. Suddenly some one discovered that Nielsen was missing. The fact filled me with consternation and alarm. He might have walked in his sleep and fallen over the rim. What had become of him? All his outfit lay scattered round in his bed. In my bewilderment I imagined many things, even to the extreme {{that he might have}} left us in the lurch. But when I got to that sad pass of mind I suddenly awakened as if out of an evil dream. My worry, my hurry had obsessed me. High time indeed was it for me to meet this situation as I had met other difficult ones. To this end I went out away from camp, and forgot myself, my imagined possibilities, and thought of my present responsibility, and the issue at hand. That instant <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>my</b> injustice toward Nielsen, and reproached myself.|$|E
30|$|The idea of {{self-assessment}} {{was totally}} {{new to me}} and I was suspicious if it works effectively because I did not trust in students’ ability to justly assess themselves. Now I think differently because it did work successfully. I was happy when <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that <b>my</b> grading sense became {{a little closer to}} teachers each time.|$|R
5000|$|... "You have to {{also get}} out of {{thinking}} that your life is {{the most interesting thing}} you have to write about. I had to write about myself when I started out, it was therapy. But the older I got the more <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that <b>my</b> life isn't that interesting, so I started to write about other stuff." ...|$|R
5000|$|Zachary Wyatt {{developed}} {{an interest in}} politics as a teen, an interest that was further enhanced {{when he had the}} opportunity to serve as a legislative intern for Missouri United States Senator Christopher [...] "Kit" [...] Bond in 2007. According to Wyatt: [...] "It was at this time <b>I</b> first <b>realized</b> <b>my</b> call in life was to serve Missouri through politics." ...|$|R

Despite facing another obstacle after the Persian Gulf War, al-Othman remained positive. She {{said in an}} interview that “I am living a new childhood with my grandchildren.

500|$|After leaving Hollywood in the mid-1960s, Baker {{travelled}} with Bob Hope's Christmas USO troupe entertaining {{soldiers in}} Vietnam and Southeast Asia, an experience which she described as reformative: [...] "In the hospitals I held {{the hands of}} damaged young men, and <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that <b>my</b> pain was not exclusive: that in this world there was suffering much more terrible than mine." ...|$|R

I began to ask myself if I was as willing to die for my convictions as Vietnamese and American soldiers all around me were being asked to do. I {{was looking for a}} way to say yes to life instead of operating by static lines drawn by our church over the centuries. Later when I returned to theological studies, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>my</b> question was not a new question. During the most dynamic periods of creativity our churches had tried many ways to point to a different path. In fact many had died for their choices. I was coming to see myself as operating in that stream." ...|$|E

50|$|Raised in Sacramento, California {{until the}} age of 24, Hot Rod worked as {{mortgage}} broker until spotted by the G-Unit boss 50 Cent, who signed him to his label in 2006. Hot Rod would send his homemade demo CD to 50 Cent's G-Unit office's in hope the record label would sign him. After 50 Cent heard the CD he thought that Hot Rod's easy flow reminded him of his own. It was December 2005 when the 24-year-old rapper received a call at his day job as a mortgage broker, and it wasn't from any random G-Unit associate but 50 Cent himself.Hot Rod started in hip-hop as a teenager in the mid ‘90s, making beats. “When my pops made me his assistant music engineer at the church. That's when <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>my</b> passion for music,” he reflects, “I've always had it in my blood so there was no stopping me from that point on”.|$|E

That's too bad, but it's true. Everywhere they talk war--war---war and its hardships.
