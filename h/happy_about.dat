5|$|In the episode, Jack's (Sean Hayes) {{talk show}} Jack Talk is {{completely}} revamped, after right-wing conservatives {{take over the}} gay network, OutTV. The new owners hire the ultra-conservative Amber-Louise (Spears) as Jack Talks new co-host, infuriating Jack. While Jack is deciding {{whether or not he}} will stand up to his new bosses, Karen (Megan Mullally) desires a baby of her own. After seeing Grace (Debra Messing) so <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> her pregnancy, Karen decides she wants a baby and offers to pay a surrogate (Sykes) to carry one for her.|$|E
5|$|Maben was {{concerned}} {{that one of the}} problems with the film was that it was too short. In early 1973, Maben was fly fishing with Waters, and suggested the possibility of improving the film by watching them at work in a recording studio. Subsequently, Maben was invited with a small crew using a single 35mm camera to Abbey Road Studios to film supposed recording sessions of The Dark Side of the Moon, as well as interviews conducted off-camera by Maben, and footage of the band eating and talking at the studio cafeteria. Maben was particularly <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> this footage, feeling it captured the spontaneous humour of the band. This version premiered on 21 August 1974, and ran for 80 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The OKL was not <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> {{supporting}} Cerberus. Jeschonnek {{remarked to}} Galland that if Cerberus failed then the Luftwaffe {{would be made}} a scapegoat. Jeschnonnek was to be proved right. During the 12 January 1942 meeting, the Navy demanded maximum fighter cover be given and won Hitler's support. Should anything go wrong, the Navy would most likely blame the Luftwaffe for damage sustained by enemy air forces. During the meeting Jeschonnek stood his ground and refused to give any guarantees or to reinforce the Western Fighter Forces from other theatres. Galland was given executive power for the air operation which was given the code name Unternehmen Donnerkeil (Operation Thunderbolt). The existence of the operation was so secret that both Jeschonnek and Galland had to sign secrecy pledges as they left Hitler's Headquarters in East Prussia.|$|E

5|$|In 1952, Hornsby {{was again}} hired {{to manage the}} St. Louis Browns, his first major league job in 16 years. The Browns' owner, Bill Veeck, {{was the son of}} former Cubs {{president}} and general manager William Veeck, Sr. Hornsby was not well received by the players, however. On June9, he was fired due to a disagreement with Veeck over an incident against the Yankees the day before. During the game, a fan prevented Gil McDougald of the Yankees from catching a fly ball, and the umpire ruled that it was fan interference. Hornsby did not initially argue the call, and a few minutes later Veeck forced him to do it (when {{it was already too late}} to do anything about it). This led to Hornsby and the Browns parting ways. The Browns players were so <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> Hornsby's firing that they gave Veeck an engraved trophy to thank him.|$|E
5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} a really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E
25|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} with Broken Records Magazine, Sandoval {{said that the}} band had to get their lives back in order {{and take care of}} personal needs before getting back into music, but was extremely <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> the response the band was getting from fans.|$|E
6000|$|Her husband answered: [...] "She's the {{potentiality}} {{of several}} kinds of fanatic. She's very unhappy, and I don't see how she's to be <b>happier</b> <b>about</b> that poor fellow. I shouldn't be surprised if she did inspire him to attempt something of that kind." ...|$|R

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Kennedy assassination while Rather was a Dallas reporter, he interviewed a minister who said some local schoolchildren had cheered upon learning of the President's shooting. The Associated Press later confirmed the story. A teacher at the school backed up the Rather story, confirming that some students at the school had cheered at the principal's news about Kennedy. Eddie Barker, local Dallas-area news director for CBS, said that Rather had in fact been aware that the children were merely <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> being sent home early and they had not been given a reason for early school closure (Barker's children attended the school, as he informed Rather). He stated that Rather had deliberately misrepresented the facts by indicating that the children were <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> the shooting. Barker attempted to fire Rather, but was overruled by the national CBS News management.|$|E
25|$|In interviews, {{he likes}} to tell, he would have decided the age of eight, to be a clown. His father had not been very <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> it, he had wished that his son is a trapeze artist like him. But {{eventually}} he would agree {{and would have been}} the son equally funded as requested.|$|E
25|$|When she did so, the king, Gustav III, {{was highly}} amused by her story. He {{allowed her to}} marry a {{librarian}} at the royal court, Erik Johan Paulin. They were both described as very <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> this. Paulin had a priest-education, and the king gave him the post of vicar in Kungsbacka parish. Carin was related to Charlotte Du Rietz, to whom the monarch had a strong attachment.|$|E

6000|$|The Major {{answered}} with a groan, but added, [...] "And yet, even now, stained as {{he tells me he}} is, and cut off in the flower of his age, I thank my God and his Saviour, and after Him, you and yours, that I am <b>happier</b> <b>about</b> him than I have been these eight and twenty years." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>happier</b> <b>about</b> {{him than}} I ever thought to be. I {{do not say}} that his faith is like John's or Armine's, but he is striving back through the mists, and wishing to believe, rather than being proud of disbelieving, and Primrose knows what she is doing, and is aiding him with all her power." ...|$|R
25|$|There {{was much}} debate about {{possible}} routes that a canal could take. Coal merchants in Liverpool felt threatened about a canal {{that could bring}} coal in from Cheshire. The owners of the River Weaver Navigation were also not <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> the proposals, because the route would almost parallel that of the river. Yet another route was published which, much to the shock of Wedgwood, did not at all include the potteries.|$|E
25|$|In {{the days}} {{before the start of the}} new franchise, the IBA made it clear that they were <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> the service changes, and were {{particularly}} impressed with TVS in connection with new programming for the ITV network, in areas in which the IBA wished for improvements, mainly children's and the sciences. TVS' aims were for a different line of programming in the early evening slots, to win back the 50,000 viewers they claimed were switching over to rivals, due to the poor service provided by Southern.|$|E
25|$|The English at Saybrook {{were not}} <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> the raid, but agreed {{that some of}} them would {{accompany}} Endecott as guides. Endecott sailed along the coast to a Pequot village, where he repeated the previous year's demand for those {{responsible for the death of}} Stone, and now also for those who murdered Oldham. After some discussion, Endecott concluded that the Pequots were stalling and attacked, but most escaped into the woods. Endecott had his forces burn down the village and crops before sailing home.|$|E

Previously Dietzen had a recurring role on NCIS, starting in late season 1. [...] "After eight years of being with the show, I got a contract with CBS, and I couldn’t be <b>happier</b> <b>about</b> it," [...] Dietzen said to Entertainment Weekly.|$|R
25|$|Williams {{likely would}} have {{approached}} or exceeded Babe Ruth's home run record {{if he had not}} served in the military, and might have set the record for career RBIs as well, exceeding Hank Aaron's total. While the absences in the Marine Corps took almost five years out of his baseball career, he never publicly complained about the time devoted to service in the Marine Corps. His biographer, Leigh Montville, argued that Williams was not <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> being pressed into service in South Korea, but he did what he thought was his patriotic duty.|$|E
25|$|On 14 August, it was {{reported}} that Fernandes had flown to the Merseyside to complete the deal after being left out of the squad in Benfica's game, and he attended Everton's match against Blackburn 11 days later. Adding to the fact the player's rights were partly owned by an agency, the Premier League did not agree to the transfer as Everton would only half-own the player's contract – the English were not too <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> this as the league had previously let Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano move to other clubs under the same agreements.|$|E
25|$|After the all-night session wraps up, {{they walk}} home. Before they part ways, Girl reveals that {{she spoke to}} her husband and he is coming to live with her in Dublin. Guy persuades her to spend his last night in Dublin with him, but she stands him up and he cannot find her to say goodbye before his flight. He plays the demo for his father, who gives him money to help him get settled in London. Before leaving for the airport, Guy buys Girl a piano and makes {{arrangements}} for its delivery, then calls his ex-girlfriend, who is <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> his imminent arrival. Girl reunites with her husband in Dublin and plays the piano in their home.|$|E

500|$|She and I {{sat down}} and wrote this song about some serious insecurities that we had {{when we first started}} down this road with each other, and we both had trust issues. We were getting over it, but we wrote this song about it. And it's perfect. I couldn't be <b>happier</b> <b>about</b> that song and the way it came about and the honest way ... It is like people getting a look at {{something}} personal for the first time.|$|R
25|$|In 1846 {{the potato}} crop failed {{and there was}} a bad harvest, {{resulting}} in the price of bread going up steeply and causing 'a great distress among the poor', especially in Ireland where famine followed. But while affluent Torquinians collected over £4,000 for the relief of the Irish, many Devonians were less than <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> their own situation and decided to do something about it. Rumours of disturbances had spread around the town but no heed had been taken, so when at 7.30 p.m. on 17 May a crowd assembled in Lower Union Street the authorities were caught off guard as attacks were made on bakers' shops and women carried off the spoils in their aprons. As night drew on the rioters took advantage of the dark.|$|E
25|$|Coll's ruthlessness {{made him}} a valued {{enforcer}} to Schultz at first. As Schultz's criminal empire grew in power during the 1920s, he employed Coll as an assassin. At age 19 Coll was charged {{with the murder of}} Anthony Borello, the owner of a speakeasy, and Mary Smith, a dance hall hostess. Coll allegedly murdered Borello because he refused to sell Schultz's bootleg alcohol. The charges were eventually dismissed, and many suspect this to have been from Schultz's influence. Schultz was not <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> Coll's actions. In 1929, without Schultz's permission, Coll robbed a dairy in the Bronx of $17,000. He and his gang posed as armed guards {{to gain access to the}} cashier's room. Schultz later confronted Coll about the robbery, but rather than being apologetic, Coll demanded to be an equal partner; Schultz declined.|$|E
25|$|Conze {{immediately}} contacted Humann, who at {{the time}} was in Turkey working for a road construction company. Things then moved quickly. The German government arranged for a license to dig in Turkey and in September 1878 excavations began, headed by Humann and Conze. By 1886, large parts of the acropolis had been investigated and in the following years also scientifically appraised and published. Based on an agreement between the Ottoman Empire and the German government, starting in 1879 the relief panels from the Pergamon Altar along with some other fragments came to Berlin and into the possession of the Collection of Antiquities. The German side was well aware that by doing this a work of art was being removed from its original location and was not completely <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> this situation.|$|E
