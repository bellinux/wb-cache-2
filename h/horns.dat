5|$|Excepting some domesticated forms, {{all male}} bovids have <b>horns,</b> {{and in many}} species, females, too, possess <b>horns.</b> The {{size and shape of}} the <b>horns</b> vary greatly, but the basic {{structure}} is a pair of simple bony protrusions without branches, often having a spiral, twisted, or fluted form, each covered in a permanent sheath of keratin. Although <b>horns</b> occur in a single pair on almost all bovid species, there are exceptions such as the four-horned antelope and the Jacob sheep. The unique horn structure is the only unambiguous morphological feature of bovids that distinguishes them from other pecorans. A high correlation exists between horn morphology and fighting behaviour of the individual. For instance, long <b>horns</b> are intended for wrestling and fencing, whereas curved <b>horns</b> are used in ramming. Males with <b>horns</b> directed inwards are monogamous and solitary, while those with <b>horns</b> directed outwards tend to be polygynous. These results were independent of body size.|$|E
5|$|Gerardo Mazzetta {{and colleagues}} (1998) {{propose that the}} <b>horns</b> might also {{have been used to}} injure or kill small prey. Though horn cores are blunt, they may have had a similar form to modern bovid <b>horns</b> if there was a keratinous covering. However, this would be the only {{reported}} example of <b>horns</b> being used as hunting weapons in animals.|$|E
5|$|Male horn {{development}} {{has been linked to}} sexual selection, <b>Horns</b> are small spikes in the monogamous duikers and other small antelopes, whereas in the polygynous, they are large and elaborately formed (for example in a spiral structure, as in the giant eland). Thus, to some extent, <b>horns</b> depict the degree of competition among males in a species. However, the presence of <b>horns</b> in females is likely due to natural selection. The <b>horns</b> of females are usually smaller than those of males, and are sometimes of a different shape. The <b>horns</b> of female bovids are believed to have evolved for defence against predators or to express territoriality, as nonterritorial females, which are able to use crypsis for predator defence, often do not have <b>horns.</b> Females possess <b>horns</b> only in half of the bovid genera, and females in these genera are heavier than those in the rest. Females use <b>horns</b> mainly for stabbing.|$|E

5|$|Carnotaurus is {{the only}} known {{carnivorous}} bipedal animal {{with a pair of}} <b>horns</b> on the frontal bone. The use of these <b>horns</b> is not entirely clear; several interpretations have revolved around use in fighting conspecifics, in display, or in killing prey.|$|E
5|$|Domestic sheep are {{relatively}} small ruminants, usually with a crimped hair called wool and often with <b>horns</b> forming a lateral spiral. Domestic sheep differ from their wild relatives and ancestors in several respects, having become uniquely neotenic {{as a result of}} selective breeding by humans. A few primitive breeds of sheep retain some of the characteristics of their wild cousins, such as short tails. Depending on breed, domestic sheep may have no <b>horns</b> at all (i.e. polled), or <b>horns</b> in both sexes, or in males only. Most horned breeds have a single pair, but a few breeds may have several.|$|E
5|$|In Tibetan Buddhism, sharabha is {{represented}} as a beast with a goat's head and <b>horns,</b> a lion's mane and horse's body and legs. It symbolizes determination, strength and speed. Sometimes, it {{is represented}} additionally with <b>horns</b> of an antelope and claws of an eagle. Sometimes, the goat head {{is replaced by a}} lion's, horse's feet by a lion's and <b>horns</b> can be of a ram. A common feature of all representations is the horse's body. It is often depicted as mounts of young Devas or dwarfs in a Torana – a six-level archway behind an enlightenment throne of a Buddha or Boddhisattva. Together with the devas, they symbolize the perfection of effort (virya).|$|E

5|$|The Dorset is {{an ancient}} breed that was most likely {{developed}} from horned sheep that lived in the valleys and pastures of southwestern England. Dorset Horn sheep were imported into the United States in 1860, and the first U.S. national flock book was formed in 1891. Today, the Dorset is found in two varieties globally, Horned and Polled. In the Horn variety, both ewes and rams have <b>horns,</b> while the polled variety have no <b>horns</b> at all. Polled Dorsets are ideal for commercial settings {{because they do not}} have <b>horns</b> that can get caught in fencing or cause damage when they butt.|$|E

5|$|The skull {{had a pair}} of <b>horns</b> {{above and}} in front of the eyes. These <b>horns</b> were {{composed}} of extensions of the lacrimal bones, and varied in shape and size. There were also lower paired ridges running along the top edges of the nasal bones that led into the <b>horns.</b> The <b>horns</b> were probably covered in a keratin sheath and may have had a variety of functions, including acting as sunshades for the eye, being used for display, and being used in combat against other members of the same species (although they were fragile). There was a ridge along the back of the skull roof for muscle attachment, as is also seen in tyrannosaurids.|$|E
5|$|The thin {{long legs}} of the {{hartebeest}} provide for a quick escape in an open habitat; if attacked, the formidable <b>horns</b> are used {{to ward off the}} predator. The elevated position of the eyes enables the hartebeest to inspect its surroundings continuously even as it is grazing. The muzzle has evolved so as to derive maximum nutrition from even a frugal diet. The <b>horns</b> are also used during fights among males for dominance in the breeding season; the clash of the <b>horns</b> is loud enough that it can be heard from hundreds of metres away. The beginning of a fight is marked with a series of head movements and stances, as well as depositing droppings on dung piles. The opponents drop onto their knees and, after giving a hammer-like blow, begin wrestling, their <b>horns</b> interlocking. One attempts to fling the head of the other to one side to stab the neck and shoulders with his <b>horns.</b> Fights are rarely serious, but can be fatal if they are.|$|E

The problems are investigated for two dierent representations of <b>Horn</b> theories, namely for <b>Horn</b> CNFs and characteristic models. While the problems are shown to be intractable in general, {{in the case of}} bounded disjunctions, we present polynomial time algorithms for testing the <b>Horn</b> property in both representations, and for computing a <b>Horn</b> core in the CNF representation. Even in the case of bounded disjunction, no polynomial algorithm exists (unless P=NP) for computing a <b>Horn</b> core in the characteristic model representation.

40|$|<b>Horn</b> {{formulas}} make up {{an important}} subclass of Boolean formulas that exhibits interesting and useful computational properties. They {{have been widely}} studied {{due to the fact}} that the satisfiability problem for <b>Horn</b> formulas is solvable in linear time. Also resulting from this, <b>Horn</b> formulas play an important role in the field of artificial intelligence. The minimization problem of <b>Horn</b> formulas is to reduce the size of a given <b>Horn</b> formula to find a shortest equivalent representation. Many knowledge bases in propositional expert systems are represented as <b>Horn</b> formulas. Therefore the minimization of <b>Horn</b> formulas can be used to reduce the size of these knowledge bases, thereby increasing the efficiency of queries. The goal of this project is to study the properties of <b>Horn</b> formulas and the minimization of <b>Horn</b> formulas. Topics discussed include The satisfiability problem for <b>Horn</b> formulas.

5|$|Apart {{from its}} long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back {{differentiate}} the hartebeest from other antelopes. The hartebeest shares several physical traits with the sassabies (genus Damaliscus), {{such as an}} elongated and narrow face, {{the shape of the}} <b>horns,</b> the pelage texture and colour, and the terminal tuft of the tail. The wildebeest have more specialised skull and horn features than the hartebeest. The hartebeest exhibits sexual dimorphism, but only slightly, as both sexes bear <b>horns</b> and have similar body masses. The degree of sexual dimorphism varies by subspecies. Males are 8% heavier than females in Swayne's and Lichtenstein's hartebeest, and 23% heavier in the red hartebeest. In one study, the highest dimorphism was found in skull weight. Another study concluded that the length of the breeding season is a good predictor of dimorphism in pedicle (the bony structures from which the <b>horns</b> grow) height and skull weight, and the best predictor of the horn circumference.|$|E
