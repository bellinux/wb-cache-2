She returned on February 27 at No Way Out and cost the Hardy Boyz a match. She then became the manager of <b>Edge</b> <b>and</b> Christian, and the storyline originally called for her to come between the duo, resulting in them becoming singles wrestlers with Runnels managing Christian. The storyline, however, was rewritten, and on an episode of SmackDown!, <b>Edge</b> <b>and</b> Christian—who would now continue wrestling as a tag team—revealed they no longer wanted Runnels's services. She, therefore, slapped Edge, who responded by spearing her.|$|E
