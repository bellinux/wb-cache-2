40|$|Airborne {{coal dust}} {{generated}} during mining can deposit and accumulate on mine surfaces, presenting a dust explosion hazard. When assessing dust hazard mitigation strategies for airborne dust reduction, sampling {{is done in}} high-velocity ventilation air, {{which is used to}} purge the mining face and gallery tunnel. In this environment, the sampler inlet velocity should be matched to the air stream velocity (<b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampling)</b> to prevent oversampling of coarse dust at low sampler-to-air velocity ratios. Low velocity ratios are often encountered when using low flow rate, personal sampling pumps commonly used in underground mines. In this study, with a goal of employing mine-ready equipment, a personal sampler was adapted for area sampling of coarse coal dust in high-velocity ventilation air. This was done by adapting an isokinetic nozzle to the inlet of an Institute of Occupational Medicine (Edinburgh, Scotland) sampling cassette (IOM). Collected dust masses were compared for the modified IOM <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampler</b> (IOM-MOD), the IOM without the isokinetic nozzle, and a conventional dust sampling cassette without the cyclone on the inlet. All samplers were operated at a flow rate typical of personal sampling pumps: 2 L/min. To ensure differences between collected masses that could be attributed to sampler design and were not influenced by artifacts from dust concentration gradients, relatively uniform and repeatable dust concentrations were demonstrated in the sampling zone of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health experimental mine gallery. Consistent with isokinetic theory, greater differences between <b>isokinetic</b> and non-isokinetic <b>sampled</b> masses were found for larger dust volume-size distributions and higher ventilation air velocities. Since <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampling</b> is conventionally used to determine total dust concentration, and <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampling</b> made a difference in collected masses, the results suggest when sampling for coarse coal dust the IOM-MOD may improve airborne coarse dust assessments over "off-the-shelf" sampling cassettes.

A method of <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampling</b> was established for this device for use in the exhaust system of a plasma hearth vitrification furnace.

40|$|Particulate matter (PM) {{concentrations}} in ambient air can be monitored by gravimetric sampling near a source using Federal Reference Method (FRM) samplers. PM is regulated by size, with PM 10, which {{is comprised of}} particles with aerodynamic equivalent diameters {{less than or equal}} to 10 ?m, being the main focus of this research. FRM PM 10 samplers exhibit sampling errors when sampling dusts with mass median diameters (MMDs) that are larger than the 10 ?m sampler cutpoint. For industries to be regulated equitably, these sampler errors must be quantified and understood. This research evaluates the performance of FRM PM 10 and low volume total suspended particulate (TSP) samplers under the controlled conditions of a wind tunnel. The performance evaluation was conducted by observing the sampler cutpoints, slopes, and measured concentrations. These measured values were compared to values obtained using a collocated <b>isokinetic</b> reference <b>sampler.</b> The results of this research indicate that PM 10 samplers do not operate as intended under all conditions. The cutpoint of the PM 10 inlets was significantly higher than the maximum FRM limit of 10. 5 ?m when sampling dust with MMDs larger than the cutpoint of the sampler. The slope values for the PM 10 inlets were significantly higher than the maximum FRM limit of 1. 6.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that EPA approved federal reference method (FRM) samplers can substantially misrepresent the fractions of particles being emitted from agricultural operations due to the relationship between the performance characteristics of these samplers and existing ambient conditions. Controlled testing in a wind tunnel is needed to obtain a clearer understanding and quantification of the performance shifts of these samplers under varying aerosol concentrations, wind speeds and dust types. In this study, sampler performance was tested in a controlled environment wind tunnel meeting EPA requirements for particulate matter (PM) sampler evaluation. The samplers evaluated included two low-volume PM 10 and Total Suspended Particulate (TSP) pre-separators. The masses and particle size distributions (PSDs) obtained from the filters of tested samplers were compared to those of a collocated <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampler.</b> Sampler performance was documented using two parameters: cut-point (d_ 50) and slope. The cut-point is the particle diameter corresponding to 50 % collection efficiency of the pre-separator while the slope is the ratio of particle sizes corresponding to cumulative collection efficiencies of 84. 1 % and 50 % (d_ 84. 1 /d_ 50) or 50 % and 15. 9 % (d_ 50 /d_ 15. 9) or the square root of 84. 1 % and 15. 9 % (d_ 84. 1 /d_ 15. 9). The test variables included three levels of wind speeds (2 -, 8 -, and 24 -km/h), five aerosol concentrations varying from 150 to 1, 500 mu g/m 3 and three aerosols with different PSDs (ultrafine Arizona Road Dust (ARD), fine ARD and cornstarch). No differences were detected between the performance of the flat and louvered FRM PM 10 samplers (a = 0. 05). The mean cut-point of both the PM 10 samplers was 12. 23 mu m while the mean slope was 2. 46. The mean cut-point and slope values were statistically different from the upper limit of EPA-specified performance criteria of 10. 5 mu m for the cut-point and 1. 6 for the slope. The PM 10 samplers over-sampled cornstarch but under-sampled ultrafine and fine ARD. The performance of the dome-top TSP sampler was close to the <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampler,</b> and thus it {{can be used as a}} reference sampler in field sampling campaigns to determine true PM concentrations. There were large variations in the performance of the cone-top TSP samplers as compared to the <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampler.</b> Dust type and wind speed along with their interaction had an impact on sampler performance.

40|$|The HALO Submicrometer Aerosol Inlet (HASI) was {{specifically}} designed for HALO with the aim to provide up to 30 l/min sample air flow (divided over four forward facing sample lines) to aerosol instruments mounted inside the aircraft cabin. HASI samples the air {{on the top of}} the fuselage outside of the aircraft boundary layer. The air stream is aligned in the inlet and deaccelerated in three stages by roughly a factor of 40 using a front shroud, a main diffusor and smaller diffusers at the tips of four sample tubes which protrude into the deaccelerated air stream. In addition, there is a backward-facing sample tube installed for optional use. The design concept is to allow regulating the sample air flow in each of the four forward-facing sample lines to achieve <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampling</b> conditions according to the actual speed of the aircraft. Pumps and bypass lines for regulation of the air flow are part of the Aerosol Measurement System (AMETYST) cabin rack on HALO operated by DLR. The geometric design of the inlet should prevent large cloud droplets and ice crystals from entering the sample lines directly. Judging from the first measurements of different instruments using HASI during the ML-CIRRUS and ACRIDICON-CHUVA missions with HALO, it appears that condensation particle counter (CPC) measurements of interstitial aerosol in liquid clouds are affected by artefacts while in ice clouds there is no indication of any measurement problem. Selected examples of other measurement results for initial experimental characterization of the inlet will be discussed.

In addition to passive sampling, active <b>sampling</b> using an <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampler</b> was also performed at an industrial waste incinerator. The PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs found was 268 pg TEQ m(- 3). This paper presents the first measurements of PCDD/Fs, dl-PCBs and pesticides in rural, urban and industrial areas of northern Algeria.

40|$|T {{emissions}} {{the first}} step is to identify the objectionable pollutant. This must be done before suitable abatement procedures can be taken. Abatement procedures may consist of changes in plant processes or chemical formulations or installation of pollution abatement equipment. The potential for pollutant emissions from finishing processes in the textile industry can be seen in the fact that more than ten billion pounds of fibers are processed per year, requiring 200 million pounds of resins and 200 million pounds of rpin finishing and coning oils. If only 5 % of these resins and oils are discharged in the stack Stack and duct analyses have been conducted on textile finishing ranges processing cottrn and synthetic fibers. Analytical methods used include gas chromatography, infrared spectroscopy and gravimetric analysis. Synthetic fiber spin finish, knitting lubricanis and cotton resin finishes were identitied in stack samples. When particulate loading was of interest, <b>isokinetic</b> <b>samples</b> of the stack gases were also taken. A brief summary of the sampling methods which were used and the conclusions drawn are presented...|$|R
40|$|The NASA Glenn Research Center has {{developed}} and tested a Total Water Content <b>Isokinetic</b> <b>Sampling</b> Probe. Since, by its nature, {{it is not}} sensitive to cloud water particle phase nor size, it is particularly attractive to support super-cooled large droplet and high ice water content aircraft icing studies. The instrument comprises the Sampling Probe, Sample Flow Control, and Water Vapor Measurement subsystems. Results and conclusions are presented from probe tests in the NASA Glenn Icing Research Tunnel (IRT) during January and February 2009. The use of reference probe heat and the control of air pressure in the water vapor measurement subsystem are discussed. Several run-time error sources were found to produce identifiable signatures that are presented and discussed. Some {{of the differences between}} measured Isokinetic Total Water Content Probe and IRT calibration seems to be caused by tunnel humidification and moisture/ice crystal blow around. Droplet size, airspeed, and liquid water content effects also appear to be present in the IRT calibration. Based upon test results, the authors provide recommendations for future Isokinetic Total Water Content Probe development...|$|R
40|$|The {{flame and}} soot structure, {{including}} soot primary particle nucleation, surface growth and oxidation properties, of 6 premixed and 20 diffusion flames were studied experimentally for various fuels, at temperatures of 1400 - 2350 K and at pressures of 13 - 811 kPa (0. 1 - 8. 0 atm). Measurements were made along the axes of flames with the reactants at normal temperature (300 K). The following properties were measured {{as a function}} of distance from the burner exit: soot concentrations by deconvoluted laser extinction, soot temperatures by deconvoluted multiline emission, soot structure by thermophoretic sampling and analysis using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), concentrations of major stable gas species by <b>isokinetic</b> <b>sampling</b> and gas chromatography, concentrations of radial species (H, OH, O) by deconvoluted Li/LiOH atomic absorption, and flow velocities by laser velocimetry. The measurements were analyzed to determine local soot surface growth, oxidation and nucleation rates, as well as local flame properties that are thought to affect these rates. The measurements of soot surface growth rates (corrected for soot surface oxidation) were consistent with the measurements in laminar premixed and diffusion flames involving a variety of hydrocarbons at variable pressure. In addition, the growth rates fro...|$|R
