Bedford left after making <b>formative</b> <b>contributions</b> to the band and did not feature again, although Woodgate stayed {{for most of the}} band's career. The band took their name from the Greek meaning of the name Melissa, meaning bee's honey.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{conversation}} between work in labour history and labour geography, in part centring on the <b>formative</b> <b>contribution</b> of E. P. Thompson. We contend that the commitment to multiple and political forms of agency and working-class experience and the positioning of class as process, which are lasting contributions of The Making of the English Working Class, offer resources for re-invigorating debates on agency within labour geography and beyond. The paper scrutinizes the spatial politics at work in Thompson’s account of agency and experience through drawing on critiques of Thompson by feminist and post-colonial scholars. The paper explores the significance of Thompson’s work for asserting a spatial politics of labour and argues for attention to the diverse agentic spatial practices shaped through labour organizing and struggles. The paper concludes by setting out some key aspects of the terms of a conversation between labour geographies and labour histories...|$|R
40|$|The {{new edition}} {{is a useful}} {{overview}} of six major directors, a densely descriptive homage to the genre, and a touchstone {{in the history of}} film genre criticism. Critics familiar with the 1969 edition will appreciate the way Kitses has updated and elaborated on his initial premises. Readers new to Western genre criticism should see the work as an important strand in a broad range of critical discourses that now includes, among others, studies of gender in Westerns by Lee Clark Mitchell and Jane Tompkins, materialist, industry-based analyses by Peter Stanfield, Peter Lehman 2 ̆ 7 s extensive readings and re-readings of John Ford 2 ̆ 7 s The Searchers, deconstructive approaches to representations of Native Americans by Armando Jose Prats, and archival work on silent Westerns by Scott Simmons.

40|$|Meer and Modood {{identify}} {{a variety of}} reasons why the notion that Muslim minorities could be subject to racism by virtue of their real or perceived ‘Muslimness’ is met with much less sympathy than the widely accepted notion that other religious minorities in Europe, particularly Jewish groups, can be the victims of racism. They begin by elaborating the relationships between Islamophobia, anti- Muslim sentiment and cultural racism, before turning to the results of interviews with journalists who make allegedly <b>formative</b> <b>contributions</b> to our understanding of anti-Muslim sentiment. Meer and Modood delineate and discuss four tendencies. The first is the conceptualization of racism that assumes that the protections afforded to racial minorities conventionally conceived as involuntarily constituted should not be extended to Muslims because theirs is a religious identity that is voluntarily chosen; one salient, discursive, trope germane to this view takes Muslim minorities to task for the adoption of a ‘victim mentality’. The second is that the way that religion per se is frowned upon by the contemporary intelligentsia invites the ridiculing of Muslims as being salutary for intellectual debate and not, therefore, an issue of discrimination. Third, while ethnic identities are welcomed in the public space, there is much more unease about religious minorities. This means that some commentators, who may otherwise sympathize with Muslim communities, argue {{that it is difficult to}} view Muslims as victims when they may themselves be potential oppressors. Finally, some find it difficult to sympathize with a minority that is perceived to be disloyal or associated with terrorism, a view that leads to a perception of Muslims as a threat rather than as a disadvantaged minority, subject to increasingly pernicious discourses of racialization. Each of these tendencies could benefit from further study, underscoring the need for a greater exploration of anti-Muslim discourse...|$|E

The research {{was carried out in}} Biology Education Departement to students who took Botany Phanerogamae instruction on 2009 / 2010. Many of formative assessment strategies were applied on theory and practical study, such as group presentation task, concept diagram, to observe practical and presentation activity, drawing book task and practical report. And some of the instrument used on this study were habits of mind tracing questionnaire, work observation sheet on the theoty and practical study, concept diagram, task and rubric for drawing book task, practical report and student questionnaire. The result of the research shows that there is an <b>contribution</b> of <b>formative</b> assessment to the habits of mind, with medium classified with the R value of 0, 654.

2500|$|As {{a culture}} critic and artistic doctrinaire, he found affinities with the Western European Futurists, Cubists, and {{especially}} Simultaneists, whose non-static art, he believed, {{was a more}} accurate representation of the human experience. Like the Futurists, young Vinea cheered for industrialization and Westernization, giving enthusiastic coverage to the Young Turk Revolution. He was thus also an advocate of social realism, praising Maxim Gorky and, in later years, Dem. Theodorescu, Vasile Demetrius, Ion Călugăru, and Panait Istrati. Vinea's hobbyhorse was defending cosmopolitanism against traditionalist nationalism: he publicized the <b>formative</b> <b>contribution</b> of Greeks, Jews and Slavs to old and new Romanian literature, and ridiculed the conservative antisemitism of critics such as Ilarie Chendi, Mihail Dragomirescu, and Nicolae Iorga. Other noted targets were moderate [...] "academic" [...] Symbolists, including Anna de Noailles, Dimitrie Anghel, and especially Ovid Densusianu; and modernists of uncertain convictions, among them Eugen Lovinescu—to whom Vinea reserved some of his more bitter sarcasm. In a 1916 piece, he imagined Lovinescu as [...] "a youth, already a bourgeois, already bloated and probably soft".|$|R
40|$|Unpredictably {{and without}} benefit of a {{university}} education or the professional training of a scholar, the English writer Gerald Brenan (1894 - 1987) became the first serious historian of the Spanish Civil War (1936 - 1939). His most important work, The Spanish Labyrinth (1943), was fundamental {{to the development of}} British and American historiography of that conflict. While British writers and intellectuals expressed passionate views about the Civil War, Gerald Brenan was unique in objectively depicting the deeper causes of the war. His attempt to unravel the forces that had led Spain into this disastrous conflict resulted in The Spanish Labyrinth and other studies of Spanish culture. This thesis explores Brenan’s <b>formative</b> <b>contribution</b> to Spanish historiography, placing his work against the background of the polarized and ideologically driven writing about Spain that dominated the late 1930 s. It examines Brenan’s analysis of the background of a civil war deeply rooted in the complexity of the nation’s social structures and institutions. It considers his ongoing absorption in Spanish culture in the years after and his analysis {{of the impact of the}} war on life in Franco’s Spain. Finally, it attempts to measure Brenan’s influence on several generations of historians, particularly those who wrote major studies of the Spanish Civil War in English at a time when critical historical work in Spain was limited by restrictions on scholarly research and the expression of critical opinions...|$|R
40|$|I {{was on a}} {{panel with}} two presenters who {{addressed}} the RCSW’s recommendations on childcare. The commentator, Alexandra Dobrowolsky used my paper to contextualize the other papers. Members of the audience remarked that my paper presented information that was not familiar to them {{and that they would}} like to be able to refer students to this material. The implication of these comments and the activity poses a challenge to present my research in a form that makes it accessible to a new generation of students and other readers, including younger instructors, who do not have ready access to readily digestible information about the RCSW. In revising the book mss from which the material has been drawn, I will keep this prospective audience in the front of my mind. The Report of the RCSW has been a landmark public document, ‘the public face of liberal feminism,’ a foundational document in the inception of Women’s Studies and the progenitor for the emergence of Women and Politics as a subfield in the study of Canadian politics. Scholarship about the RCSW has relied heavily over the past 40 years on the reflections of two participants, the Chairman and the Executive Secretary, for accounts of what happened and why. This excessively narrow interpretive frame has entirely disregards all but 10 % of the submissions, the Minutes of the meetings of the Commission that were supposed to have been destroyed, audiotapes of the public hearings available since 1995, surveillance by the Security Intelligence branch of the RCMP of some organizations that prepared briefs, and almost all of the materials deposited by the Commission with the Library and Archives of Canada. This paper draws on these primary sources, elaborated in “Primed and Ticking, the Royal Commission on the Status of Women, 1970 ” (University of Toronto Press, forthcoming 2010) to provide a more complete and nuanced account of this <b>formative</b> <b>contribution</b> to the development of women’s equality in Canada. Based on those findings the paper looks ahead to areas requiring further work in order to realize more of the explosive power of gender analysis in the next half century...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation {{is the key}} to {{effective}} interface design. It becomes even more important when the interfaces are for cutting edge technology, in application areas that are new and with little prior design knowledge. Knowing how to evaluate new interfaces can decrease development effort and increase the returns on resources spent on formative evaluation. The problem is that there are few, if any, readily available evaluation tools for these new interfaces. This work focuses on the creation and testing of a new set of heuristics that are tailored to the large screen information exhibit (LSIE) system class. This new set is created through a structured process that relies upon critical parameters associated with the notification systems design space. By inspecting example systems, performing claims analysis, categorizing claims, extracting design knowledge, and finally synthesizing heuristics; we have created a usable set of heuristics that is better equipped for supporting <b>formative</b> evaluation. <b>Contributions</b> of this work include: a structured heuristic creation process based on critical parameters, a new set of heuristics tailored to the LSIE system class, reusable design knowledge in the form of claims and high level design issues, and a new usability evaluation method compariso...|$|R
40|$|Assessment for Learning (AfL) {{remains a}} {{controversial}} {{and a significant}} aspect of education across the world, with both opportunities and dangers being presented as this strategy moves from being a radical new initiative to becoming routine. Investigating children’s experiences of AfL {{with a group of}} higher achieving pupils in a junior school in England, consideration is given to their cognitive responses to AfL, their personal psychological responses and their experiences of AfL in interaction with their teachers. Theoretical positioning is primarily drawn from the psychoanalytic concepts of Donald Winnicott – creativity and compliance, True and False Selves and the potential space. Lesson aims, success criteria, feedback, self-assessment and peer assessment are viewed {{through the eyes of the}} children with results which both support and challenge underlying <b>formative</b> assessment theory. <b>Contributions</b> to knowledge include the effects of the routinization of AfL; the necessity of taking into account the impact of the educational context in any study of AfL; the selective use that pupils make of AfL strategies; and the importance of taking the age, maturity and experience of pupils into account when examining the effectiveness and impact of AfL strategies in the classroom. These assessment strategies are being developed within a context of ‘assessment as measurement’ where ‘learning’, ‘progress’ and ‘improvement’ are regarded by pupils and staff alike as taking place when increasingly higher national curriculum levels in maths and English are being achieved by the children. The danger of routinization is apparent as pupils employ the assessment strategies they have been taught and have experienced throughout their school careers in a mechanical and instrumentalist way. As one pupil said, ‘It’s a bit like cleaning your teeth in the morning. It’s something you just do. ...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, the {{education}} and training systems in Italian universities have undergone strong changes to adapt to European standards and to improve the educational and training quality by personalization of the courses (Isfol, 2003). Of essential importance {{is the role of}} the tutor, as system mediator, a communication facilitator and moderator of the work group atmosphere. Especially in the academic world, tutors are of increasing importance and Italian universities accompany and support their actions, in favour of the students and in order to prevent and combat the dispersion phenomenon. These actions are carried out also for disabled students who enrol in university. The number of disabled students registered at Italian universities over the last 20 years has grow: from academic year 2000 - 2001 to 2007 - 2008 the number of registered disabled students increased from 4 813 to 12 403 (Miur-Cineca, 2008). If in the 70 ’s academic education was a privilege for the lucky few, the social, political and economic evolution of the 80 ’s produced also a new generation who felt the right and duty to study. Italian law 17 of 1999 is an important result as it formally allows disabled students the benefit of the special tutorial supports that promote the realization of autonomy and integration strategies. The term Specialized Tutorial Services includes all activities and services that aim to integrate the disabled student in the university life, and that create the necessary conditions and situations needed to offer disabled students the same study opportunities and treatments. These study services are set up in several Italian universities. The so-called peer tutor is a student who is enrolled in the same university course as the disabled students. Peer tutors offer their time and expertise in exchange for a fee and a <b>formative</b> experience. The <b>contribution</b> we are presenting analyses peer tutoring in favour of the registered disabled students at Italian universities, and is part of a two-years research (still in progress) funded by the University of Padova (STPD 08 HANE_ 005) in support of students with learning difficulties. The main research goals are: 1) accumulating knowledge and studying of the phenomenon and specified literature analysis, 2) description and mapping of peer tutoring services offered to disabled students registered at the eleven Italian "Mega" universities (Censis, 2011), 3) the comparison of the main activities and duties of the peer tutors in the eleven examined universities. The study has been realized through an analysis and comparison of the data collected through the eleven Italian universities' web sites, and by setting up of comparison grids for the peer tutor activities. The peer tutor role as disability support will be used to describe the strategies and activities planned and carried out in Italian universities. Also, we will present the significant experiences of peer tutoring support for the disabled at the University of Padova...|$|R
