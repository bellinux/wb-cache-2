2500|$|LulzSec drew {{its name}} from the {{neologism}} [...] "lulz", (from lol), [...] "laughing out loud", which represents laughter, and [...] "Sec", short for [...] "Security". The Wall Street Journal characterized its attacks as closer to Internet pranks than serious cyber-warfare, while the group itself claimed to possess the capability of stronger attacks. It gained attention in part due to its brazen claims of responsibility and lighthearted taunting of corporations that were hacked. It frequently referred to Internet memes when defacing websites. The group emerged in May 2011, and successfully attacked websites of several major corporations. It specialized in finding websites with poor security, stealing and posting information from them online. It used well-known straightforward methods, such as SQL injection, to attack its target websites. Several media sources have described their tactics as <b>grey</b> <b>hat</b> hacking. Members of the group may have been involved in a previous attack against the security firm HBGary.|$|E
