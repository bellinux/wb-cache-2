40|$|In {{the search}} for {{efficiency}} {{as one of the}} main means to be an important player in the current globalized markets, a procedure is developed in this research trying to identify potential benefits of including <b>intermediate</b> <b>facilities</b> for the delivery stage of a distribution system. The specific purpose is to improve the efficiency of a vehicle which has to serve several clients in a region and for this a heuristic is developed. This procedure has as base a heuristic to solve the p-median problem and another one for the construction of routes. Then, a stage to improve the solution is added. This heuristic is used to evaluate different instances generated for the vehicle routing problem with <b>intermediate</b> <b>facilities.</b> From the results generated it may be seen that the density, the local distances, the radial distances, and other characteristics have a very important impact in the savings that can be obtained with the inclusion of <b>intermediate</b> <b>facilities...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{location}} of <b>intermediate</b> <b>facilities</b> in a two-tiered collaborative distribution network. We consider horizontal collaboration in a geographical cluster of suppliers, with thousands of customers spread over the whole country. The distribution system includes one consolidation facility in the production area {{and a set of}} <b>intermediate</b> <b>facilities</b> called regional distribution centers (RDCs). It combines full truckload (FTL) routes between the production area and the RDCs and less-than-truckload (LTL) shipments from the RDCs to each customer. We propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation for the optimal location of RDCs. This model integrates the two transportation rate structures and enables direct deliveries from the production area to customers when FTL routes are not profitable...|$|E

The main trend has been towards increased outsourcing, and larger modules and more complex components are being delivered to the final-assembly plants, often in sequence. Sequencing, kitting and subassembly are frequently done at the supplier location or at an additional, <b>intermediate</b> <b>facility.</b> The need for materials handling is related to the design of materials flow systems in relation to process localisation. Five cases, having different numbers of process localisations and types of activities, are compared based on actual efficiency and potential of the system design. The results indicate that there is a large difference in the efficiency of the materials handling function depending on the existence of an <b>intermediate</b> <b>facility,</b> primarily connected to the handling of transport packages.

To study how IFs change the result of the problem, we firstly present a simple model based on clustering algorithm along with finding the shortest route between clusters, implementing Clarke and Wright’s algorithm within each cluster. Then we determine a set of design of experiments which allows us to study different characteristics of the problem. Generating graphs and tables from the results, we analyse them by considering two concepts; radial routing and local routing distances. The outcomes show the more important role of radial routing distance which has often significantly higher impact compared to the local routing distance...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} two {{optimisation}} problems arising {{in the context}} of city logistics and two-level transportation systems. The two-echelon vehicle routing problem and the two-echelon location routing problem seek to produce vehicle itineraries to deliver goods to customers, with transits through <b>intermediate</b> <b>facilities.</b> To efficiently solve these problems, we propose a hybrid metaheuristic which combines enumerative local searches with destroy-and-repair principles, as well as some tailored operators to optimise the selections of <b>intermediate</b> <b>facilities.</b> We conduct extensive computational experiments to investigate the contribution of these operators to the search performance, and measure the performance of the method on both problem classes. The proposed algorithm finds the current best known solutions, or better ones, for 95 % of the two-echelon vehicle routing problem benchmark instances. Overall, for both problems, it achieves high-quality solutions within short computing times. Finally, for future reference, we resolve inconsistencies between different versions of benchmark instances, document their differences, and provide them all online in a unified format...|$|E
40|$|Keywords:Distribution network design, network configuration, {{supply chain}} management, {{inventory}} control, facility location. Abstract. One significant decision in {{supply chain management}} {{is to determine the}} configuration of the supply chain network. However, studies that analyze different configurations are rare in the literature. This paper considers a supply chain network consisting of one supplier and a number of retailers. Two different configurations were proposed and were compared in terms of total cost for the network. In the first configuration, retailers directly order to the supplier and hold the inventory to meet the demand of customers. However, in the second configuration, a number of <b>intermediate</b> <b>facilities</b> were established to order products from the supplier and satisfy the demands of retailers. The inventory of retailers in the latter configuration is stored in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>facilities.</b> These two configurations were compared in terms of total cost. Numerical calculations indicate that the latter configuration was preferred in most cases...|$|E

The importance of waste management is underlined in the introduction, together with justi cations on using Operations Research to optimise waste manage- ment. The waste management system is described and the importance of <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Facilities</b> is highlighted. The unique scenario of the problem is explained and how the problem will be solved in colabotration with the CSIR. In the literature review the problem is considered from the grass routes up and shown to be a Location Arc Routing Problem (LARP). The methods for solving the problem through heuristics are then discussed. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) heursitic is selected to solve the LARP and is lastly tested and taylored towards benchmark problems. The GA proved to be competent in solving the LARP, but had much randomness present in the model. Thesis (B Eng. (Industrial and Systems Engineering)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010...|$|E

They may include both upper and lower limits on the used capacity of each facility and may also consider the situation where there is no flow conservation in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>facilities.</b> Primal-dual heuristics were developed to solve efficiently the proposed models.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a real world waste collection problem in which glass, metal, plastics, or paper {{is brought to}} certain waste collection points by the citizens of a certain region. The collection of this waste from the collection points is therefore a node routing problem. The waste is delivered to special sites, so called <b>intermediate</b> <b>facilities</b> (IF), that are typically not identical with the vehicle depot. Since most waste collection points need not be visited every day, a planning period of several days has to be considered. In this context three related planning problems are considered. First, the periodic vehicle routing problem with <b>intermediate</b> <b>facilities</b> (PVRP-IF) is considered and an exact problem formulation is proposed. A set of benchmark instances is developed and an efficient hybrid solution method based on variable neighborhood search and dynamic programming is presented. Second, in a real world application the PVRP-IF is modified by permitting the return of partly loaded vehicles to the depots and by considering capacity limits at the IF. An average improvement of 25 % in the routing cost is obtained compared to the current solution. Finally, a different but related problem, the so called multi-depot vehicle routing problem with inter-depot routes (MDVRPI) is considered. In this problem class just a single day is considered and the depots can act as an intermediate facility {{only at the end}} of a tour. For this problem several instances and benchmark solutions are available. It is shown that the algorithm outperforms all previously published metaheuristics for this problem class and finds the best solutions for all available benchmark instances...|$|E
40|$|Warehouse Location is a nonconvex {{programming}} problem {{involving the}} geographic placing and sizing of <b>intermediate</b> <b>facilities</b> in distribution studies. The nonconvexities {{are caused by}} economies of scale associated {{with the cost of}} building and operating the facilities. A heuristic program has been developed for solving warehouse location problems when these economies are representable by continuous concave functions. The paper discusses the heuristics used and computational experience with the program on "practical" problems. On the basis of two numerical examples for which an optimal solution was obtained through a special purpose experimental mixed integer programming code, it is conjectured (1) that near optimal solutions can be achieved using the heuristic program and (2) that optimal sizing and locating of facilities are very sensitive to the shapes of the warehousing cost functions. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Cross-docking is a {{distribution}} system where products transported from warehouses to destinations are unloaded temporarily at <b>intermediate</b> <b>facilities,</b> and loaded onto outbound trucks {{to be shipped}} to their final destination. The complexity of cross-docking operations has been considered a problem {{of great interest to}} researchers and practitioners in the areas of Scheduling, Optimization, Supply Chain Management, and Operations Research. In this paper, a cross-docking simulation model is proposed to study the cross-docking problem. This problem has been addressed in the literature previously, but was considered in a deterministic fashion and with several strong assumptions. The contribution of our study is to present a stochastic discrete-event simulation for the problem where several scenarios will be studied aiming at relaxing some of the assumptions set by previous work. Finally, the study reveals {{some of the most important}} parameters that must be investigated in a crossdocking problem, and analyzes their significance on the final results...|$|E
