Reaction times for identifying a vernier offset to one side among verniers offset to the opposite side increase with the number of distractors, indicating serial processing. Even deviations below a photoreceptor diameter can be detected at once. The visual system thus attains positional accuracy below the photoreceptor diameter simultaneously at different positions.

We {{calculate}} {{the distribution of}} the stress intensity factor for a semi-infinite tensile crack with a slightly curved front embedded in some infinite medium, up to second order in the <b>deviation</b> <b>from</b> <b>straightness.</b> From there, we determine the equilibrium shape of the front of the crack when it propagates along a heterogeneous fracture plane, up to second order in the toughness fluctuations. As a first application, we show that the “apparent fracture toughness ” experienced by a crack propagating in a randomly heterogenous material is slightly less than the rigorous average value of the local toughness. As a second application, we determine the equilibrium shape of a crack front penetrating into an infinitely elongated harder obstacle...|$|E

In this paper we investigate the shape of a confining relativistic string for a general motion of its end. We determine analytically the shape of the curved string to leading order in <b>deviation</b> <b>from</b> <b>straightness,</b> and show that it reduces to an expected non-relativistic result. We also demonstrate numerically that in realistic meson models this deviation is always small. We further find that the angular momentum and energy are the same as for the straight string, but that the curved string has a small radial momentum not present in a straight string. Our results justify the common assumption of straight strings usually made in hadron models. ...|$|E

2500|$|The term versine is also {{sometimes}} {{used to describe}} <b>deviations</b> <b>from</b> <b>straightness</b> in an arbitrary planar curve, of which the above circle is a special case. Given a chord between two points in a curve, the perpendicular distance v from the chord to the curve (usually at the chord midpoint) is called a versine measurement. For a straight line, the versine of any chord is zero, so this measurement characterizes the straightness of the curve. In the limit as the chord length L goes to zero, the ratio [...] goes to the instantaneous curvature. This usage is especially common in rail transport, where it describes measurements of the straightness of the rail tracks {{and it is the}} basis of the Hallade method for rail surveying.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis work {{presents}} {{a solution for}} the elastic T-stress {{at the tip of}} a slightly curved or kinked crack based on a perturbation approach. Compared to other exact or numerical solutions the present solution is accurate for considerable <b>deviations</b> <b>from</b> <b>straightness.</b> The T-stress variation as crack extends along a curved trajectory is subsequently examined. It is predicted that T-stress always keeps negative during crack extension when the crack has an initial negative T-stress. In the case of a positive T-stress and non-zero first and second stress intensity factors initially accompanying the crack, the T-stress is not positive with increasing the extension length until a threshold is exceeded. Based on directional stability criterion with respect to the sign of the T-stress, this result implies that for a straight crack with a positive T-stress, the crack extension path will not turn immediately and instead keep a stable growth until a critical length is reached. This prediction is consistent with experimental observations...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic weight {{functions}} are discussed, for arbitrary time-dependent loading {{of a plane}} semi-infinite crack extending at constant speed in an infinite isotropic elastic body. Then, the weight function appropriate {{to the case of}} general normal (or Mode I) loading is constructed explicitly, employing Fourier transforms to develop and solve a Wiener-Hopf problem. Transforms are inverted by a variant of Cagniard's technique. The weight function is then employed to develop a relationship, in the framework of first-order perturbation theory, between the Mode I stress intensity factor and a small but otherwise arbitrary time-varying <b>deviation</b> <b>from</b> <b>straightness</b> of the edge of the crack. 1. INTRODUCTION Weight functions were introduced into elastostatics by Bueckner (1970).

40|$|Point-to-point {{movements}} constrained to {{the horizontal}} plane are generally straight, although they exhibit slight <b>deviations</b> <b>from</b> <b>straightness.</b> Unconstrained horizontal movements (i. e., movements where the hand is lifted) are more curved in their projection onto the horizontal plane than constrained movements. It {{has been argued}} that this difference in horizontal curvature is due to differences in the space in which the movements were planned (joint space versus work space, respectively). The current study challenged this explanation. We found that horizontal curvature of constrained movements increased when moving over a round surface compared to moving over a flat surface and when friction was low compared to when friction was high. Because all these movements were constrained movements this suggests that the earlier reported differences in horizontal curvature between constrained and unconstrained movements may not originate from a difference in the movements' planning space. The discussion addresses how factors related to planning and factors related to biomechanics may contribute to the magnitude of horizontal curvature in unconstrained and constrained movements.

5|$|Phase Shifting Interferometry {{addresses}} {{several issues}} associated with the classical analysis of static interferograms. Classically, one measures {{the positions of the}} fringe centers. As seen in Fig.13, fringe <b>deviations</b> <b>from</b> <b>straightness</b> and equal spacing provide a measure of the aberration. Errors in determining the location of the fringe centers provide the inherent limit to precision of the classical analysis, and any intensity variations across the interferogram will also introduce error. There is a trade-off between precision and number of data points: closely spaced fringes provide many data points of low precision, while widely spaced fringes provide a low number of high precision data points. Since fringe center data is all that one uses in the classical analysis, all of the other information that might theoretically be obtained by detailed analysis of the intensity variations in an interferogram is thrown away. Finally, with static interferograms, additional information is needed to determine the polarity of the wavefront: In Fig.13, one can see that the tested surface on the right deviates from flatness, but one cannot tell from this single image whether this <b>deviation</b> <b>from</b> flatness is concave or convex. Traditionally, this information would be obtained using non-automated means, such as by observing the direction that the fringes move when the reference surface is pushed.|$|R

At age 9 years (post-thinning), stem straightness was measured using both image analysis and a six-point subjective scale. Diameter at breast height (DBH; 1. 3 m) was measured at both age 5 (pre-thinning) and age 9 years. & Results Significant additive genetic variation was observed. Strong, positive and significant additive genetic correlations were observed between the stem straightness assessment methods and between DBH at ages 5 and 9 years. Significant positive genetic correlations were shown between subjectively scored stem straightness and DBH at both ages 5 and 9 years. & Conclusion The six-point subjective scoring method is a cost-effective selection criterion for stem straightness in E. globulus. The image measurement technique may be applied where objective estimates of stem straightness are required, for training purposes and to verify subjective scores. Keywords Eucalyptus globulus.

40|$|The {{third most}} common conifer in Sweden is Pinus contorta (lodgepole pine). It {{originates}} {{from the western}} part of North America and was brought here in the end of the 1920 s. The lodgepole pine is today allowed for commercial plantations in central and northern Sweden, excluding high altitude locations. Since 1979 only plantations with scientific purpose are allowed in south-central and south Sweden. This document is focused on how lodgepole pine manage perform compared with Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine) in the southernmost part of Sweden, Götaland. The idea came {{from the fact that the}} Swedish government is evaluating a notification from the National Forest Agency that suggests lodgepole pine to be allowed for commercial plantation even in southern Sweden. Two experimental sites have been visited, one in Östergötland and one in Småland. At the sites measurements were taken in two provenances of lodgepole pine and in one of Scots pine. Based on the measurements calculations were made with five functions created by Elfving & Norgren (1993). The calculations showed that lodgepole pine grows better than Scots pine on both locations but the differences are greater on locations with harsh climate conditions. Of the two provenances of lodgepole pine, the southernmost had the largest basal area and the largest standing volume on both sites. The Scots pine had suffered damage from various agents on the site in Småland and the comparisons between the species were not reliable at that location. Besides the measurements, seven different quality indicators were classified subjectively. <b>Deviations</b> <b>from</b> <b>straightness</b> were higher for Scots pine than lodgepole pine on both locations. Based on this study, lodgepole pine seems to be well adapted to be used as a complement to the native Scots pine on poor soil and locations with harsher climate conditions even in Götaland.

40|$|Sixty-three {{straight}} pruned radiata pine butt logs 4. 9 m {{long were}} sawn exclusively to 25 mm boards under a standard pattern in three timber grade studies. Produce was graded by the National Timber Grading Rules (NZS 3631 : 1978) and timber prices from the Waipa Wholesale Price List 1978 were applied. No price {{was available for}} clears so a range of three was used. Variation in the price for clears {{was found to have}} a very significant effect on log values. Because the random occurrence of resin pockets can confound results, basic data used in this paper are from grades produced when resin pockets were ignored. Results showed the production of clearwood and values and grades realised from pruned butt logs are determined by three major factors: log size, defect core size, and log conversion percentage. A Grade Index has been derived in which the relationship of these factors is expressed as: dbh x log conversion Grade Index =. defect core Data from the 3 studies were combined in a Grade Index Model which defines a pruned log value gradient, the expected outturn in clears, and gives an approximation of the proportions in other grades. Results from an independent fourth sample of 12 logs were used to validate the Grade Index Model. Because the Grade Index is an expression of the quality of pruned butt logs which may be used either predictively or reflectively, applications to stand planning, evaluations of silvicultural regimes, and evaluations of existing pruned stands are proposed. Future application of Grade Index to real stands would be facilitated by more detailed forest records on the timing, implementation, and result of pruning operations. Further research into the classification and effect of <b>deviations</b> <b>from</b> <b>straightness</b> in pruned butt logs is also necessary because at present the index is confined to straight logs.

40|$|Compressed {{flexures}} have a downwards-tunable stiffness {{in their}} compliant directions; their stiffness can theoretically {{be reduced by}} up to four orders of magnitude. The compression-stiffiness relation is linear {{for most of the}} loading, and this behavior can be taken advantage of to use the flexure as a tunable spring, opening up new design possibilities. Compressed flexures present the possibility of developing more sensitive flexure-based instruments such as accelerometers. The purpose of this research was to characterize the behavior of compressed flexures and develop guidelines for their design. Tradeoffs were assessed when substituting compressed flexures for conventional flexures and their suitability for use in a precision system. An experimental setup was designed and built to test a stage guided by four compressed flexure bearings. Compression was applied to the test flexures via a displacement input that was deamplified by a wedge pair to increase preload resolution. The motion in each of the stage's six degrees of freedom in response to flexure compression and in response to a voice coil actuator acting in the flexure's compliant direction was measured by seven capacitance probes arranged around the test stage, and a seventh capacitance probe measured the input displacement. With the experimental setup it was found that a stiffness reduction of a factor of 7 was possible. The magnitude of parasitic motions in the test stage were found to increase linearly with flexure compression. When being actuated in the compliant direction, parasitic motions were evident with magnitudes of the same order of magnitude as the sensor noise. Compressed flexures are highly sensitive to thermal variations; a 0. 5 C temperature increase resulted in an 11 % increase in stiffness. A model developed in this thesis predicts that <b>deviations</b> <b>from</b> column <b>straightness</b> of 2 % of the flexure thickness limit the stiffness reduction to a factor of 1. 2, while a deviation of 0. 2 % allows for a stiffness reduction of 10, 000. by Aaron E.
