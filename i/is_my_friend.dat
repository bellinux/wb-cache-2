[...] Later, Rendell said, [...] "Though Norman <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend</b> and remains so, his failure to appear casts a new light on his assertions regarding the original [...] case. As a result I will follow other elected officials and donate the money he contributed to me to charity." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon afterwards, Gore {{also had}} to contend with the Lewinsky scandal, {{involving}} an affair between President Clinton and an intern, Monica Lewinsky. Gore initially defended Clinton, whom he believed to be innocent, stating, [...] "He {{is the president of the}} country! He <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend</b> [...] I want to ask you now, every single one of you, to join me in supporting him." [...] After Clinton was impeached, Gore continued to defend him stating, [...] "I've defined my job in exactly the same way for six years now [...] to do everything I can to help him be the best president possible." ...|$|E

500|$|Vickers, {{who would}} leave Hendrick Motorsports in 2007 for Red Bull Racing Team, said: [...] "I would {{expect them to}} be a little upset. Jimmie <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend,</b> my teammate, and he is running for a championship. But he knows just as well as I do that if I wasn't bump-drafting, he never would have had a shot to pass Junior." [...] Additionally, he denied that he drove more aggressively because he was leaving. Third-place {{finisher}} Kurt Busch argued Vickers was in a [...] "Catch-22" [...] situation: [...] "He was trying to help his teammate. It just didn't turn out that way. Vickers was doing the best he could to help the 48. He just didn't anticipate the 8 car blocking as long as he did." [...] Vickers would later receive additional security during the next race weekend.|$|E
500|$|Xhinovci {{is unable}} to return to Germany because of his appearance, as the country has a series of laws which {{prohibit}} Nazi symbols, uniforms, slogans and forms of greeting. He has expressed a great dislike of Serbs, and says {{that he would have}} to carry a concealed handgun every time he wished to visit the Serb-held section of Mitrovica. Xhinovci says that he is greatly disappointed with post-war Kosovo, as he believed that reconciliation between Albanians and Serbs would have occurred after the conflict. When asked if it was difficult to portray Hitler, Xhinovci responded: [...] "It is easy. I find myself in Hitler's character because he fought against my enemy. The enemy of my enemy <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend.</b> Yes, Serbs are my enemies." [...] About his physical similarity to Hitler, he says: [...] "I am not a dictator like him, but it is of great financial benefit that I resemble him." ...|$|E
500|$|Well, let’s see… the {{guy with}} the poodle on his head would be me. The very {{pregnant}} woman with the sunglasses is my wife Suzanne.

The woman in the foreground with her legs crossed is my first-cousin-once-removed Tammy (who also played Queen Amidala in my video for [...] "The Saga Begins"). Uh Jeff, the guy that screens my fan mail, is the guy wearing the NY Yankees cap way in the back. Steve Jay's son Ian is the really tall blond bicycle messenger. Tracy Berna, one of the writers for The Weird Al Show, is the waitress with the beehive hair-do. The Boy Scout is Dylan Bostick, the oldest son of one of Suzanne's oldest friends. Bermuda's wife Leslie is in there too. Plus there’s my mother-in-law, my father-in-law, my electrician, a couple from my church, the owner of my favorite ice cream shop, my aunt's boyfriend… I think we got maybe 2 or 3 people from the casting office, but the overwhelming majority were friends and family members that just wanted to come to the shoot.|$|E

2500|$|Lowe's first {{assignment}} {{was with the}} Topographical Engineers, where his balloon was used for aerial observations and map making. Eventually he worked with Major General Irvin McDowell, who rode along with Lowe making preliminary observations over the battlefield at Bull Run. McDowell became impressed with Lowe and his balloon, and a good word reached the President, who personally introduced Lowe to Union General-in-Chief Winfield Scott. [...] "General, this <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend</b> Professor Lowe who is organizing an aeronautics corps and who is to be its chief. I wish you would facilitate his work in every way." [...] This introduction fairly well settled the selection of Lowe as Chief Aeronaut. The details of establishing the corps and its method of operation were left up to Lowe. The misunderstanding that the Balloon Corps would remain a civilian contract lasted its duration, and neither Lowe nor any of his men ever received commissions.|$|E
5000|$|A simple copula {{predicate}} {{consists of}} sé am/is/are only. The negative marker pa and the TMA (tense-mood-aspect) markers can co-occur with the copula-type predicate, subject to certain rules (TMA markers: té past or anterior, kay prospective or irrealis, ka nonpunctual, sa abilitative). One such {{rule is that}} té + sé → sété (or just té without sé). The combinations permitted in an equative clause are limited in natural speech: a maximum number of two tense, mood, aspect and copula morphemes can co-occur in a given clause. Here are some examples of the equative clause type in Haitian Creole (predicates are in bold): (7) Ou sé jan mwen. You <b>are</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend.</b> Ou té jan mwen. You <b>were</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend.</b> Ou kay jan mwen. You will <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend.</b> Ou pa té kay jan mwen. You wouldnt <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend.</b> Ou sa jan mwen. You can <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend.</b> Ou pa sa jan mwen. You cannot <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend.</b> Non mwen sé Tjals. <b>My</b> name <b>is</b> Charles. Tjals sété an Endyen. Charles was an Indian.Escure & Schwegler claim that sé is a copula verb. DeGraff [...] argues that sé in Haitian Creole is a resumptive pronominal that spells out the trace produced by subject-raising to Spec (CP) from within a small clause headed by the nominal predicate. The subject is first merged within the (extended) projection of the nominal predicate - i [...]e., in the subject position of the small clause - but it must move to Spec (CP) in order to check its Case and satisfy the Extended Projection Principle.|$|R

2500|$|In 1966 Hunter {{moved to}} London, where he joined The Scenery with guitarist Miller Anderson, drummer Dave Dufort and {{keyboard}} player Dante Smith. There Hunter met Mick Ronson, then guitarist of bands the Voice and The Rats, at the Flamingo Club in London. According to Anderson, [...] "Mick {{was coming down}} the stairs ... {{and we were going}} up and I said, `Mick, this <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend,</b> Ian [...] Patterson.'" [...] The Scenery, now with John Vernon Smith on drums, recorded tracks with Bill Farley at Regent Sound that were licensed for international release without their knowledge. Hunter and Anderson recall writing and recording [...] "To Make a Man Cry," [...] but not the B-side, [...] "Thread of Time." [...] John Vernon Smith appears on the picture sleeve, but Johnny Banks, of The Merseybeats, played on the record. Johnny Gustafson was also included in the session work. The songs were released on the Impact label, and it is unclear whether they originated from France or Belgium.|$|E
2500|$|Republican candidates, running {{concurrently}} {{with the}} 1964 federal election, were {{undermined by the}} unpopularity of Barry Goldwater, the Republican challenger for the US Presidency, {{and the leader of}} their political ticket. Not long before election day, Goldwater scheduled a visit to Las Vegas. Laxalt's advisors told him he should [...] "duck" [...] Goldwater as they feared any association with the Arizona Senator would spell trouble. Laxalt, who often described Goldwater as his [...] "political Godfather", reportedly told his aides, [...] "Listen, Barry Goldwater <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend.</b> If I snubbed him now, I could never look him in the face again. I would rather lose." [...] The Laxalt-Goldwater meeting on the tarmac was splashed on the front pages of local newspapers. (Goldwater lost Nevada by 28,000 votes.) [...] Still, the Laxalt-Cannon race remained far closer than expected. As he watched the returns come in from his home in Carson City, Laxalt was stunned when one of the television networks actually declared him the winner. The next morning he flew to Las Vegas where he was told that certain precincts reported late and that Cannon had won by 48 votes. [...] The race was the subject of intense controversy for years.|$|E
