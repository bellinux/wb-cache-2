40|$|Abstract- First {{generation}} <b>gas</b> <b>insulated</b> <b>switchgears</b> were con-structed {{with large}} safety margin. Today’s trend {{is to reduce}} the size of the switchgears to save material and costs. With increased field strength due to reduced dimensions as well as increased pressure in the compartments, the influence of surface rough-ness, surface damages and conducting particles is increasing. Therefore the knowledge of the exact inception level of partial discharges due to those imperfections is of interest. The goal of the present contribution is to measure the discharge inception voltage in SF 6 in a homogeneous field configuration with a small protrusion with unprecedented high accuracy. With a short pulse X-ray source first electrons are provided within the critical volume. The experimental results show for a 0. 2 MPa SF 6 insula-tion a threshold voltage of roughly 80 kV for positive and nega-tive polarity at the protrusion, respectively. These inception voltages match the calculated theoretical inception level. The proposed method allows determining the inception voltage in a more efficient way as the experiment time is reduced...|$|R

40|$|Almost all {{of modern}} <b>gas</b> <b>insulated</b> <b>switchgears</b> (GIS) use sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) as {{insulation}} material. Therefore, GIS quality much or less depends on {{quality of its}} SF 6. Failure however can arise within operation of SF 6 GIS due to quality decline of SF 6. Quality decline of SF 6 in GIS can be recognized by existence of decomposition product of SF 6, which may appear due to partial discharge, arc during switching, etc. Therefore quality control of SF 6 insulation in GIS is {{necessary in order to}} prevent failure occurred due to SF 6 quality decline.

Fluoronitriles chemical gas compound based on 3 M™ NOVEC 4710 have a high dielectric strength, more than 2 times that of SF 6 and a low Global Warming Potential (GWP).

The same experiments are reproduced for pure SF 6 for the comparison.

40|$|For partial {{discharge}} (PD) diagnostics in <b>gas</b> <b>insulated</b> <b>switchgears</b> (GISs) {{based on the}} ultra-high-frequency (UHF) method, {{it is essential to}} study the attenuation characteristics of UHF signals so as to improve the application of the UHF technique. Currently, the performance of UHF has not been adequately considered in most experimental research, while the constructive conclusions about the installation and position of UHF sensors are relatively rare. In this research, by using a previously-designed broadband sensor, the output signal is detected and analyzed experimentally in a 252 kV GIS with L-shaped structure and disconnecting switch. Since the relative position of the sensor and the defect is usually fixed by prior research, three circumferential angle positions of the defect in cross section are performed. The results are studied by time, statistics and frequency analyses. This identifies that the discontinuity conductor of DS will lead to a rise of both the peak to peak value (Vpp) and the transmission rate of the UHF signal. Then, the frequency analysis indicates that the reason for the distinction of signal amplitude and transmission rate is that the mode components of the PD signal are distinctively affected by the special structure of GIS. Finally, the optimal circumferential angle position of the UHF Sensor is given based on the comparison of transmission rates...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} insulation {{diagnosis of}} SF 6 <b>gas</b> <b>insulated</b> <b>switchgears</b> (GIS) by detecting partial discharge (PD) -induced electromagnetic (EM) waves using UHF method. Sensitively detecting PD signals is effective to prevent breakdown in GIS because PD is a pre-breakdown phenomenon. Breakdown in SF 6 gas under nonuniform field takes place when PD type proceeds from streamer to leader discharge. Therefore, breakdown prediction becomes possible by discriminating PD type, that is, by detecting generation of leader discharge. An amplitude of PD-induced EM wave {{depends on the}} time derivative of PD current. Experimental results revealed that the time derivative in rising part of PD current for streamer discharge is almost same as that for leader one while that in the falling part is quite different. Thus, one can recognize the generation of leader discharge by noting {{the ratio of the}} EM wave magnitude of the positive peak value to the negative one of the first incoming EM wave. In this study, an attempt was made to discriminate leader and streamer-type discharges {{on the basis of the}} amplitude ratio of first incoming EM wave measured with UHF sensors. Furthermore, we investigated effects of trigger level of a digital oscilloscope in the measurement of the EM wave and UHF sensor position on detection sensitivity and discrimination probability of PD type while changing the SF 6 gas pressure and the applied ac voltage. As a result, it was found that leader discharge can be discriminated from streamer one with a probability as high as 70 % using a criterion of amplitude ratio of first incoming EM wave VP+/VP-= 0. 7. When VP-= 0. 8 is used as criterion, the discrimination probability increases as high as 80 %...|$|R

40|$|Fault arcs in {{electrical}} installations occur extremely seldom. However, {{they can not}} be avoided totally. Insulation failure, flashover, malfunction or maloperation by service personnel can lead to powerful fault arcs. As a result switchgear installations and even substation buildings may be endangered by thermal and mechanical stress. Metal enclosed switchgears can withstand some hundred mbar overpressure, substation buildings e. g. constructed of bricks may be damaged by overpressures exceeding 3 mbar. The goal of this work is the investigation of possibilities to reduce overpressure due to internal arcs especially in switchgear rooms or substation buildings. The following measures are analysed:- pressure relief openings,- intermediate volumes and relief ducts,- fault arc energy absorbers. Encapsulated (<b>gas</b> <b>insulated)</b> <b>switchgears</b> are provided with overpressure relief devices which lead to the switchgear room. After fault arc ignition pressure rises in the compartment where the arc burns (arc room), the relief devices open and the overpressure in the switchgear room rises. The level of overpressure depends significantly on fault arc duration and power, which can be about some 10 MW in distribution systems. The overpressure reduction in the switchgear room can be achieved e. g. by sufficiently dimensioned pressure relief openings. Another possibility is the use of intermediate rooms as buffer volumes or pressure relief ducts, which can be installed on switchgears draining hot gases. Fault arc energy absorbers are cooling grids, which withdraw energy from hot gases generated by the fault arc with the result of overpressure reduction. The overpressure development is analysed by using two available program packages. The first one leads to pressure results, which are averaged values in the volume under consideration. The second one is a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tool with three dimensional results. To quantify the effect of fault arc energy absorbers, experiments with a high-current test set-up are performed. The results of these investigations shall contribute to a safe design of measures for overpressure reduction in the case of fault arcs {{in electrical}} installations...|$|R
40|$|A Holonic Manufacturing System (HMS) is a {{manufacturing}} system where key elements, such as machines, cells, factories, parts, products, persons, teams, etc., have autonomous and cooperative properties. These elements are called 2 ̆ 2 holons. 2 ̆ 2 In an HMS, each holon 2 ̆ 7 s activities are determined through cooperation with other holons, {{as opposed to}} being determined by a centralized mechanism. An HMS could therefore enjoy high agility, which is critical for today 2 ̆ 7 s manufacturing systems. How to define holons for a given problem context, what should be the appropriate holonic architecture, how to design effective cooperation mechanism among holons for overall system performance, however, are critical issues to be investigated before HMS can be realized in practice. ^ Scheduling is a key factor for manufacturing productivity. In this dissertation, holonic scheduling is developed for a factory consisting of multiple cells. The co-operation mechanisms among holons are established based on the 2 ̆ 2 Lagrangian relaxation technique 2 ̆ 2 of mathematical optimization. The method thus provides a theoretical foundation for guiding the cooperation among holons, leading to globally near-optimal performance. Through a novel modeling of the interactions among cells and a decomposition-coordination solution method, cooperation across cells is performed without accessing the private information and intruding the decision authority of individual cells. The embedded route selection mechanism also balances the load among candidate cells. Schedules generated have comparable computational requirements and solution quality as compared to those generated through a centralized method, and speedup can be obtained by better initialization and distributed processing. In addition, the clear delineation of information, responsibilities, and interfaces of individual holons and the object-oriented implementation make the system extendible to more complicated manufacturing settings. ^ As one of the test case, the scheduling system is extended for the manufacturing of Toshiba 2 ̆ 7 s <b>gas</b> <b>insulated</b> <b>switchgears.</b> The manufacturing is characterized by significant machine setup times, strict local buffer capacities, the option of choosing a few alternative processing routes, and long horizon as compared to the time resolution required.

The treating of finite capacity buffers as machines, the embedded routing selection mechanism, and the time-step reduction technique also contribute to the state-of-the-art and practice of scheduling methodology. ...|$|R
