2500|$|The market {{expanded}} slowly. That changed around 1978 as Panasonic marketed its [...] "Goldcaps" [...] brand. This product {{became a}} successful energy source for memory backup applications. Competition started only years later. In 1987 ELNA [...] "Dynacap"s entered the market.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to these marketing strategies, Google Chrome has created several [...] "Chromebook minis" [...] that demonstrate the ease of use and simplicity of the devices in a comical manner.

[...] A request by the State Department for additional emails led to negotiations with her lawyers and advisors. In October, the State Department sent letters to Clinton and all previous Secretaries of State back to Madeleine Albright requesting emails and documents related to their work while in office. On December 5, 2014, Clinton lawyers delivered 12 file boxes filled with printed paper containing more than 30,000 emails. Clinton withheld almost 32,000 emails deemed to be of a personal nature.

50|$|A data {{synchronization}} {{point is}} a point in time.

A data synchronization {{point is a}} point in time when a set of backups exist which if restored from can be synchronized to the same point in time. Often this point in time is some hours before the last backup is completed, i.e., some hours before the <b>data</b> synchronization point. <b>Backups</b> that have no synchronization points are generally useless.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Cloud {{storage is}} an {{emerging}} service model that enables individuals and enterprises to outsource {{the storage of}} <b>data</b> <b>backups</b> to remote cloud providers at a low cost. However, cloud clients must enforce security guarantees of their outsourced <b>data</b> <b>backups.</b> We present FadeVersion, a secure cloud backup system {{that serves as a}} security layer on top of today’s cloud storage services. FadeVersion follows the standard version-controlled backup design, which eliminates the storage of redundant data across different versions of backups. On top of this, FadeVersion applies cryptographic protection to <b>data</b> <b>backups.</b> Specifically, it enables fine-grained assured deletion, that is, cloud clients can assuredly delete particular backup versions or files on the cloud and make them permanently inaccessible to anyone, while other versions that share the common data of the deleted versions or files will remain unaffected. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype of FadeVersion and conduct empirical evaluation atop Amazon S 3. We show that FadeVersion only adds minimal performance overhead over a traditional cloud backup service that does not support assured deletion. I...|$|R
