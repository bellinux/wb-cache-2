5|$|The {{alignment}} of NY167 follows the Paine's <b>Hollow</b> <b>Road,</b> constructed between Little Falls and Paines Hollow. This new road would shorten {{time between the}} two communities through Herkimer County. The Paine's <b>Hollow</b> <b>Road</b> opened on October 4, 1921, opening a new road through the dairy country of the Mohawk Valley. The new road had branch alignments toward Oneonta, Cooperstown and Richfield Springs. At 1 p.m. (1800 UTC) that day, a convoy of vehicles drove the route south from Little Falls, with a band on a large truck and a coach with six horses. When the group reached Paines Hollow, a ceremony was held, led {{by the president of}} the Little Falls Chamber of Commerce and H.P. Snyder, the local legislator for Herkimer County. The new section between Paines Hollow and Jordanville cost $123,136.25 (1921 USD) and was designated as State Highway1363.|$|E

The overlap with NY287 was eliminated in the early 1950s after NY28B was truncated to begin in Prospect.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Pekin, Route98 {{passes through}} {{farmland}} in unincorporated Groveland Township. The highway meets Cole <b>Hollow</b> <b>Road</b> and California Road at successive intersections {{in a residential}} area. Past a creek, the road heads into a rural area with sections of farmland and forest. As it enters Groveland, the highway intersects County Route1, which runs south through the community.

It remained unchanged until April1, 1997, when ownership and maintenance of the route was transferred from the state of New York to Steuben County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. In the switch, NY333 and nearby NY432, both maintained by the state, were given to Steuben County in exchange for maintenance of NY415 from Meads Creek Road in Coopers Plains (northwest of Painted Post) to Babcock <b>Hollow</b> <b>Road</b> in Bath as well as for maintenance of Hamilton Street (the original routing of NY17) between US15 and Gang Mills.

60|$|The nine English {{guns were}} {{altogether}} overmatched {{by those of}} Soult's heavy battery. Moore, seeing that the half-column advancing by Baird's flank made no movement to penetrate beyond his right, directed him to throw back one regiment and take the French in flank.
