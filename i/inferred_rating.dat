40|$|User-based {{collaborative}} filtering {{is one of}} the most widelyused recommender methods. It recommends items to a user according to her similar users ’ opinions. The key point of user-based {{collaborative filtering}} is to compute users ’ similarities. In traditional user-based collaborative filtering, the similarity between two users is determined by their ratings to co-rated items. In some cases, two users rate few common items, such that the similarity between them may be inaccurate and it results in misleading recommendations. With the rapid development of social tagging systems, social tagging data poses new opportunities for recommender systems. Many researchers have proposed different methods to exploit tagging data to improve the performance of recommender systems. In this paper, we propose a new approach to compute users ’ similarities using the inferred tag ratings. A user’s preference for a tag t can be inferred based on her ratings of items tagged with t. A user rates too few such items, then her <b>inferred</b> <b>rating</b> to t may be inaccurate. Hence the relationships among tags are used to infer her preference for t based on all her item ratings, such that the preference of user could be accurate. Experiments were done on the MovieLens data set to evaluate the performance of our approach. The results show that our approach outperform traditional user-based collaborative filtering...|$|E

Data from this location exist in paper {{record for the}} 1957 - 1967 period, and in two distinct electronic records for the 1967 - 2005 and 2005 - 2015 period. In this study, we digitize the early record, and established {{a link between the}} two electronic records to create a unique, nearly 60 year-long instrumental sea-level record. This work creates one of the longest instrumental sea-level records in the Pacific Islands. These data are critical for the study of regional and interannual variations of sea level.

40|$|Current {{sequencing}} methods produce {{large amounts}} of data, but genome assemblies constructed from these data are often fragmented and incomplete. Incomplete and error-filled assemblies result in many annotation errors, especially {{in the number of}} genes present in a genome. This means that methods attempting to estimate rates of gene duplication and loss often will be misled by such errors and that rates of gene family evolution will be consistently overestimated. Here, we present a method that takes these errors into account, allowing one to accurately <b>infer</b> <b>rates</b> of gene gain and loss among genomes even with low assembly and annotation quality. The method is implemented in the newest version of the software package CAFE, along with several other novel features. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method with extensive simulations and reanalyze several previously published data sets. Our results show that errors in genome annotation do lead to higher <b>inferred</b> <b>rates</b> of gene gain and loss but that CAFE 3 sufficiently accounts for these errors to provide accurate estimates of important evolutionary parameters.

The above method, while having potential for <b>inferring</b> arrival <b>rate</b> statistics of various kinds of flows without the need to identify the flow to which each packet belongs, originally has limited practical applicability. In this paper, therefore, to extend the range of application of the method, the following improvements are proposed:i) finding the minimum effective rate of each flow and inferring a statistic {{of the difference between}} the minimum effective rate and the flow rate itself; ii) quantizing rate values into bins with an appropriate bin size; and iii) <b>inferring</b> <b>rate</b> statistics of some flows indirectly from those of some other “well inferable ” flows.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this grant was to develop new methods for {{inference}} of, in particular, recombination rates from population genetic data. <b>Inferring</b> recombination <b>rates,</b> and how they vary over small scales, is important for both the design and analysis of association studies for disease genes, and to gain a deeper understanding about the biology and evolution of recombination rates. It is only methods that <b>infer</b> recombination <b>rates</b> from population data that {{have been able to}} describe the fine-scale variation of recombination rates across genome-wide scales. The impact of such methods can be seen by a number of high profile papers that first demonstrated that recombination hotspots are common across the whole human genome (Crawford et al., 2004; McVean et al., 2004; Fearnhead and Smith, 2005), produced the first fine-scale recombination map for the human genome (Myers et al., 2005), and have started to find relationships between recombination hotspots and DNA sequence motifs (Myers et al., 2005). The methodological focus of the project was motivated by the ever-increasing amount of population genetic data that is being collected for various populations and organisms; and the lack of full-likelihood methods for <b>inferring</b> recombination <b>rates</b> that can scale to analyse large data sets.

As molecular dating depends upon accuracy of <b>rate</b> modelling, <b>inferred</b> <b>rate</b> variation within long branches has been hy-pothesized to contribute to dating error, e. g. in the crown node of angiosperms [4].

40|$|Introduction Not {{all sites}} in protein {{sequences}} evolve {{at the same}} rate during the course of evolution. The working hypothesis assumes that evolutionary conserved sites in a protein sequence point to functionally important regions. Thus, identifying conserved regions in a protein impacts such areas as functional annotation studies, drug design, quaternary structure prediction, and protein biochemistry [1]. Conservation levels are typically inferred from multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of homologous proteins. Recently, `Rate 4 Site' [2] was developed as a tool for the identification of functional regions in proteins using the maximum likelihood (ML) criteria. However, Bayesian rate inference techniques are also plausible. When considering a Bayesian rate inference a few alternatives exist: (1) the <b>inferred</b> <b>rate</b> is the expectation of the rate over the posterior rate distribution (BAYES-EXP), and (2) the rate yielding the highest posterior probability is chosen (BAYES-MAP).

Using our measurements, we have calculated the Fe XVIII and Fe XIX Dn= 0 DR DR rate coefficients. Significant discrepancies exist between our <b>inferred</b> <b>rates</b> {{and those of}} published calculations. These calculations overestimate the DR rates by factors of ~ 2 or underestimate it by factors of ~ 2 to orders of magnitude, but none are in good agreement with our results. Almost all published DR rates for modeling cosmic plasmas are computed using the same theoretical techniques as the above-mentioned calculations. Hence, our measurements call into question all theoretical Dn= 0 DR rates used for ionization balance calculations of cosmic plasmas. At temperatures where the Fe XVIII and Fe XIX fractional abundances are predicted to peak in photoionized gases of cosmic abundances, the theoretical rates underestimate the Fe XVIII DR rate {{by a factor of}} ~ 2 and overestimate the Fe XIX DR rate by a factor of ~ 1. 6. We have carried out new multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock and multiconfiguration Breit-Pauli calculations which agree with our measured resonance strengths and rate coefficients to within typically better than <~ 30 %.

These short time-scales indicate that Siple Dome responds quickly to forcing at its boundaries.
