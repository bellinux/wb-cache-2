About 11:00 on 19 November, Cyrus Vance and Herbert S. Okun toured Vukovar on a United Nations fact-finding mission.

Predators hunt smaller animals such as the rabbits, voles, mice, and shrews found in the park's grasslands and sagebrush-covered hills. Bushy-tailed woodrats inhabit caves and crevices in the monument's rock formations. Bighorn sheep, wiped out in this region in the early 20thcentury, were reintroduced in the Foree Area of the Sheep Rock Unit in 2010.|$|E

5|$|American {{alligators}} are apex {{predators and}} consume fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Hatchlings feed mostly on invertebrates. They {{play an important}} role as ecosystem engineers in wetland ecosystems through the creation of alligator holes, which provide both wet and dry habitats for other organisms. Throughout the year, but particularly during the breeding season, American alligators bellow to declare territory and locate suitable mates. Male American alligators use infrasound to attract females. Eggs are laid in a nest of vegetation, sticks, leaves, and mud in a sheltered spot <b>in</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> water. Young are born with yellow bands around their bodies and are protected by their mother for up to one year.|$|E

5|$|Erosion-resistant basalt {{underlies}} much of the watershed, {{and streams}} passing over it are relatively free of sediments. However, turbidity increases when unstable soils sandwiched between layers of basalt and other volcanic rocks are disturbed and wash into the river during rainstorms. Despite legal protections, about 22percent of the protected zone was logged {{during the second half}} of the 20thcentury, and erosion increased. For a time in 1996, Portland had to shut down the Bull Run supply because of turbidity and switch to water from wells. A law passed later that year prohibited most logging <b>in</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> watershed, and since then the Portland Water Bureau and the United States Forest Service have closed many of the logging roads and removed culverts and other infrastructure contributing to erosion.|$|E
5|$|Huh had {{difficulty}} {{in designing the}} Pig Girl's mask and attempted several different designs which were rejected before arriving at the chosen mask, but cannot imagine Mu-Yeon wearing any other mask now. Yen Press licensed Pig Bride for an English-language release in North America and began serializing it in the manga anthology Yen Plus. The final issue of Yen Plus in July 2010 contained the conclusion to Pig Bride. The English localization process included Korean onomatopoeia and sound effects with the anglicized word followed by the English translations. Signage and text is commonly written with English translations <b>in</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> panel it appears instead of replacing the original text.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} 20 {{years of the}} BAA/NBA, the league {{was still trying to}} gain the support of fans who lived <b>in</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> teams' home markets. To achieve this, the league {{introduced}} the territorial pick rule to help teams acquire popular players from colleges in their area who would presumably have strong local support. Before the draft, a team could forfeit its first-round draft pick and then select any player from within a 50-mile radius of its home arena. Although the territorial picks were selected before the draft, these picks were not factored into the overall selection count of the draft; therefore, the first non-territorial pick of the draft was considered the first overall pick.|$|E

5|$|Most early {{theories}} of gamma-ray bursts posited nearby sources within the Milky Way Galaxy. From 1991, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) and its Burst and Transient Source Explorer (BATSE) instrument, an extremely sensitive gamma-ray detector, provided data {{that showed the}} distribution of GRBs is isotropic—not biased towards any particular direction in space. If the sources were from within our own galaxy they would be strongly concentrated <b>in</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> galactic plane. The absence of any such pattern {{in the case of}} GRBs provided strong evidence that gamma-ray bursts must come from beyond the Milky Way. However, some Milky Way models are still consistent with an isotropic distribution.|$|E
5|$|On 8 November, Davorin Rudolf {{representing}} Croatian authorities, and Lieutenant Colonel General Marijan ČadJNA {{commanding officer}} of the 13th (Rijeka) Corpsagreed to evacuate the corps personnel and equipment from Croatia. The agreement, made after negotiations supervised {{and supported by the}} European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM) would later {{serve as a model for}} similar agreements elsewhere in Croatia. Čad made the agreement at his own initiative, with the support of the JNA Fifth Military District, after receiving an order from the JNA Chief of Staff Colonel General Blagoje Adžić to destroy the JNA facilities in Rijeka and to attack industrial plants and infrastructure <b>in</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> city. The agreement was not affected by the HV capture of the Draga barracks and weapons stored there on 9 November.

5|$|Operation Winter '94 was {{the first}} in a series of {{successful}} advances made by the HV and the HVO <b>in</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> Livanjsko field, an elongated flat-bottomed valley surrounded by hills. The region was formally controlled by the HVO, but the HV contributed a substantial force, including commanding officers. The attacks were primarily designed to draw the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) away from the besieged city of Bihać. The secondary objective was threatening the single direct supply route between Drvar in the Bosnian Serb Republika Srpska and Knin, the capital of the Croatian Serb Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK).|$|E
