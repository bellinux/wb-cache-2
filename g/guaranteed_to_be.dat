5|$|Progressive {{alignments}} are not <b>guaranteed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> globally optimal. The primary {{problem is}} that when errors are made at any stage in growing the MSA, these errors are then propagated through to the final result. Performance is also particularly bad {{when all of the}} sequences in the set are rather distantly related. Most modern progressive methods modify their scoring function with a secondary weighting function that assigns scaling factors to individual members of the query set in a nonlinear fashion based on their phylogenetic distance from their nearest neighbors. This corrects for non-random selection of the sequences given to the alignment program.|$|E

This task is eased somewhat by an indicating icon before the stimulus – either an arrow that points to the box the stimulus is most likely (but not <b>guaranteed)</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in, or a cross to indicate that the stimulus could appear in any box. Following thirty hour-long sessions, patients demonstrated a significant decrease in both extinction and hemispatial neglect.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, bullet or slug {{structures}} return the principal to investors {{in a single}} payment. The most common bullet structure is called the soft bullet, meaning that the final bullet payment is not <b>guaranteed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> paid on the scheduled maturity date; however, {{the majority of these}} securitizations are paid on time. The second type of bullet structure is the hard bullet, which guarantees that the principal will be paid on the scheduled maturity date. Hard bullet structures are less common for two reasons: investors are comfortable with soft bullet structures, and they are reluctant to accept the lower yields of hard bullet securities in exchange for a guarantee.|$|E
25|$|A {{recognized}} {{skill is}} tolerance for ambiguity {{and being able}} to handle open-ended problems. For instance, a knowledge-based engineering system can enhance its operational aspect and thereby its stability through more involvement by the subject matter expert, thereby opening up issues of limits that are related to being human. As in, many times, computational results have to be taken at face value due to several factors (hence the duck test's necessity arises) that even an expert cannot overcome. The end proof may be the final results (reasonable facsimile by simulation or artifact, working design, etc.) that are not <b>guaranteed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> repeatable, may have been costly to attain (time and money), and so forth.|$|E
25|$|In the {{mathematical}} formulation of quantum mechanics, pure quantum states correspond to vectors in a Hilbert space, while each observable quantity (such as the energy or momentum of a particle) {{is associated with}} a mathematical operator. The operator serves as a linear function which acts on the states of the system. The eigenvalues of the operator correspond to the possible values of the observable, i.e. it is possible to observe a particle with a momentum of 1kgm/s if and only if one of the eigenvalues of the momentum operator is 1kgm/s. The corresponding eigenvector (which physicists call an eigenstate) with eigenvalue 1kgm/s would be a quantum state with a definite, well-defined value of momentum of 1kgm/s, with no quantum uncertainty. If its momentum were measured, the result is <b>guaranteed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 1kgm/s.|$|E
