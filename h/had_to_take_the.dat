He believed it was necessary to educate children in a variety of ways. He also disagreed with the way information was being presented to students. It was being presented in a way that encouraged students to take the information that was taught to them as absolute truth. Students were denied the chance to question the information. Therefore, students could not truly learn. Montaigne believed that to truly learn, a student <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> information and make it their own.|$|E

25|$|Jouett {{suspected}} that the cavalry was marching to Charlottesville to capture the members of Virginia's government. Jouett knew that the legislature was completely undefended. Very little fighting had taken place on Virginia soil from 1776 to 1780, so most of Virginia's forces were deployed elsewhere. The British had only recently begun significant campaigns in Virginia, so few forces were in the state except a small group led by the Marquis de Lafayette, who was far from Charlottesville. With no possibility of defense, the only hope for Jefferson and the legislators was advance warning and escape. Jouett quickly mounted his horse and, at about 10 P.M., began the 40-mile ride from Louisa to Charlottesville. With the British cavalry on the main highway, Jouett <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> rough backwoods trails to the overgrown Old Mountain Road, likely traveling only with {{the light of the}} full moon. He needed to ride fast enough to outrun the British.|$|E
