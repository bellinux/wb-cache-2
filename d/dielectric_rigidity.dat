Moreover, such microsystems are definitely more sensitive to evaporation and do not allow microfluidic operations like drop scission. Another solution consists to reduce {{the thickness of the}} dielectric layer or to increase the permittivity of this one. However, a reduction in the dielectric layer involves an increase in the electric field. Under a certain thickness, the electric field is higher than the <b>dielectric</b> <b>rigidity</b> and involves a breakdown of the layer. There is thus a limit in the reduction of tension. The increase in the permittivity of the dielectric layer is limited by the weak permittivity of the hydrophobic layer. Thus, there is a breakdown even when a voltage of only few volts was applied [63].|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the results of a high voltage test in liquid argon in order to measure its <b>dielectric</b> <b>rigidity.</b> Under stable {{conditions}} and below the boiling point, liquid argon was found to sustain a uniform electric field of 100 kV/cm, applied in a region of 20 cm$^ 2 $ area across 1 cm thick gap. When the liquid is boiling, breakdowns may occur at electric fields as low as 40 kV/cm. This test is one of the R&D efforts towards the Giant Liquid Argon Charge Imaging ExpeRiment (GLACIER) as proposed Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr TPC) for the LBNO observatory for neutrino physics, astrophysics and nucleon decay searches.

40|$|During my 5 th year INSA {{internship}} I {{worked in}} ‘Bitron Industrie España SA’. This business forms part of Bitron multinational, which has over 5000 employees {{and more than}} 13 manufacturing plants. Its market sectors include appliance, automotive, hvac and energy. Bitron Industrie España is located in Sant Adria del Besos and produces mainly automotive parts. Its clients include the major car constructors of Europe like FIAT, PSA, Volkswagen group or Ford. I worked mainly in the oil group of the R&D department; this meant I dealt with problems and subjects related to electro-valves that worked with oil. The work consisted in studying the behavior of products. Analyzing their response when submitted to different tests that were asked by the client. Study improvements in the design, {{things that could be}} done to make the product cheaper to produce, more resistant to time, etc. As it {{can be seen in the}} following report tests such as Vibrations, Salted Spray Test, Endurance tests, Switch off Energy, Insulation Resistance Test, <b>Dielectric</b> <b>Rigidity</b> Test, Cleaning tests and others were performed. Samples returned by the client were also studied. Sometimes they were being used in clients’ own tests, other times they were samples that had been used in real vehicles that had stopped working, then the reason of failure had to be studied. Production problems such as really high rejection percentages, calibrating machines or checking the functionality of handmade prototypes for the costumer to use in their tests was every day work. The following pages give an example of why those tests were done, the procedure and results. Also they show day to day work, despite not everything could be put in those pages due to time and the extension of the work, the general idea of the job can be extracted from it...|$|E
40|$|Right now, {{there is}} real {{excitement}} across the broad area of materials science research, as {{the quality of the}} work improves and the potential for new levels of impact becomes more tangible. Furthermore, access to more powerful characterisation tools enables new materials to be more fully and rapidly profiled. Enhanced characterisation coupled with improved ability to control and manipulate material structure from the atomic/molecular level presents unparalleled opportunities for researchers. New modelling techniques can establish correlations between theory and practice, while innovative approaches to molecular self-assembly and 3 D printing allows full control over the spatial arrangement of materials from the molecular to the macro scale. A clearer understanding of surface and interfacial behaviour will be essential to underpin fundamental breakthroughs that in turn produce truly disruptive technologies. Stimuli-responsive materials that exhibit changes in optical (colour, absorbance, fluorescence, reflectivity), electrical/electrochemical (resistance, redox behaviour), chemical (binding-release) or physical (<b>dielectric</b> constant, viscosity, <b>rigidity,</b> volume) characteristics are opening up new concepts in so-called 4 D-materials science, in which the 4 th dimension is the ability to change materials characteristics over time in a controlled manner using external stimuli. These tremendous advances in materials science will provide the foundations for entirely new concepts in sensing – concepts that draw inspiration from biological sources and models, enabling the creation of autonomous devices that are able to monitor and manage their own condition, {{as well as that of}} their surrounding environment. New capabilities such as programmed motility, switchable selective uptake and release of molecular agents, self-maintenance/repair, and remote reporting will be commonplace, and ultimately, the ability to self-assemble, replicate, and disassemble will enable these devices to manifest many of the features of biological entities. Assembling these capabilities into new platforms based on bioinspired concepts could open the way to devices with performance specifications well beyond the current state of the art. For example, smart implantable devices capable of sensing, reporting and responding to changes in an individual’s health status, and that can function reliably within the body for many years, could dramatically improve the quality of life for many millions of people suffering from chronic conditions. Achieving this goal is arguably one of the most important global challenges for modern science. In this lecture I will explore how some of these features, albeit still at a relatively primitive stage of development, are already beginning to move from concept to demonstration. In particular, I will focus on the important role of light as a means to enable and control stimuli-responsive materials, and discuss how these might provide initial building blocks for creating these futuristic devices and platforms. ...|$|R
