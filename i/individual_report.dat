40|$|Background: During {{childhood}} emotional maltreatment (CEM) {{negative attitudes}} are {{provided to the}} child (e. g., ‘‘you are worthless’’). These negative attitudes may result in emotion inhibition strategies {{in order to avoid}} thinking of memories of CEM, such as thought suppression. However, thought suppression may paradoxically enhance occurrences (i. e., intrusions) of these memories, which may occur immediately or sometime after active suppression of these memories. Objective: Until now, studies that examined suppressive coping styles in <b>individuals</b> <b>reporting</b> CEM have utilized self-report questionnaires. Therefore, it is unclear what the consequences will be of emotion inhibition styles on the intrusion of autobiographical memories in <b>individuals</b> <b>reporting</b> CEM. Method: Using a thought suppression task, this study aimed to investigate the experience of intrusions during suppression of, and when no longer instructed to actively suppress, positive and negative autobiographical memories in <b>individuals</b> <b>reporting</b> Low, Moderate, and Severe CEM compared to No Abuse (total N= 83). Results: We found no group differences during active suppression of negative and positive autobiographical memories. However, when <b>individuals</b> <b>reporting</b> Severe CEM were no longer instructed to suppress thinking about the memory, <b>individuals</b> <b>reporting</b> No Abuse, Low CEM, or Moderate CEM reported fewer intrusions of both positive and negative autobiographical memories than <b>individuals</b> <b>reporting</b> Severe CEM.

Unqualified practitioners not only fail to provide relief to patients but also contributes to spread of diseases e. g. Hepatitis C because {{of the use of}} infected syringes and delay in reaching appropriate diagnosis and generating misconceptions in public regarding health issues. There is need to create public awareness about health risks incurred when people visits unqualified dental practitioners. Methods: We reported the awareness level in people of Jamshoro/Hyderabad, regarding qualified and unqualified dental practitioner and what difference does it makes in treatment outcome. A descriptive type of study survey done on the sample comprising of 3087 individuals visited dental OPDs at LUMHS Jamshoro/Hyderabad during month of Oct, 2012. An assessment questionnaire comprising twelve items related to the objective was developed and administered to survey. Data is analyzed using MS Excel application software. Findings: The questionnaire was responded by 3059 individuals. Response rate was 99. 09 %, among respondents 53 % males and 47 % females. Only 68. 7 % patients reported that they were aware of difference in qualified and unqualified dental practitioners, 56 % <b>individuals</b> <b>reported</b> that they ask about qualification of dental of practitioner before treatment whether he is qualified or unqualified, 43 % <b>individuals</b> <b>reported</b> that qualified dental practitioner’s treatment is better outcome, 29 % <b>individuals</b> <b>reported</b> treatment outcome more or less similar whether it qualified or unqualified, 24 % <b>individuals</b> <b>reported</b> that unqualified dental practitioner’s treatment is better outcome. 66 % <b>individuals</b> <b>reported</b> that they like to visit unqualified dental practitioner because of socio-economic reasons, 23. 6 % <b>individuals</b> <b>reported</b> that they like to visit unqualified dental practitioner because they feel more comfortable, 10. 4 % <b>individuals</b> <b>reported</b> that they like to visit unqualified dental practitioner because of unavailability of qualified dental practitioners in their areas.
