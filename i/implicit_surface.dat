Introduction The most common methods of modelling the surface of an object are to explicitly represent it as a set of polygons or parametric patches. Many Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and computer graphics systems utilise these modelling techniques.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a general approach for designing and animating complex deformable models with <b>implicit</b> <b>surfaces.</b> <b>Implicit</b> <b>surfaces</b> are introduced {{as an extra}} layer coating any kind of structure that moves and deforms over time. Offering a compact definition of a smooth surface around an object, they provide an efficient collision detection mechanism. The implicit layer deforms in order to generate exact contact surfaces between colliding bodies. A simple physically based model approximating elastic behavior is then used for computing collision response. The implicit formulation also eases {{the control of the}} object’s volume with a new method based on local controllers. We present two different applications that illustrate the benefits of these techniques. First, the animation of simple characters made of articulated skeletons coated with implicit flesh exploits the compactness and enhanced control of the model. The second builds on the specific properties of <b>implicit</b> <b>surfaces</b> for modeling soft inelastic substances capable of separation and fusion that maintain a constant volume when animated.
