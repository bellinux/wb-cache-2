5|$|In July 2009, a Jerusalem District Court {{approved}} the state’s request to <b>extradite</b> the Abergils, Sasson Barashy, Moshe Malul and Israel Ozifa to the US. In December 2010, the Supreme Court rejected an appeal {{by the three}} associates of the Abergil brothers.|$|E
5|$|In November 2014, Spanish police refused an Argentinian {{request to}} Interpol, made {{under the terms}} of a 1987 treaty, to <b>extradite</b> 20 Francoists, among them those {{involved}} in the executions, for crimes against humanity.|$|E
5|$|Taylor {{was indicted}} as an {{accessory}} in {{the assassination of}} Goebel. He fled to Indianapolis, where the governor refused to <b>extradite</b> him. At least one attempt to abduct him by force failed in 1901. Despite being pardoned in 1909 by Republican Governor Augustus E. Willson, Taylor seldom returned to Kentucky.|$|E
50|$|French Government <b>extradited</b> Martin to Madrid. She is {{the first}} French citizen <b>extradited</b> to another state, to be judged there.|$|R
50|$|From January 2004 {{to the end}} of December 2011, 7 known US {{citizens}} were <b>extradited</b> from the US to the UK. No US citizen was <b>extradited</b> for an alleged crime while the person was based in the US. The U.S. embassy in London reports that, as of April 2013, 38 individuals have been <b>extradited</b> from the US to the UK.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, Nelson Vargas Rueda was <b>extradited</b> to the United States for {{prosecution}} in the case. He {{was the first}} FARC member ever <b>extradited</b> to the USA. However, the case was dismissed when two witnesses failed to appear.|$|R
5|$|During {{the ensuing}} {{assassination}} investigation, suspicion naturally focused on deposed governor Taylor, who fled to Indianapolis, Indiana under the looming threat of indictment. The governor of Indiana refused to <b>extradite</b> Taylor, {{and he was}} thus never questioned about {{his knowledge of the}} plot to kill Goebel. Taylor became a successful lawyer in Indiana, and was pardoned in 1909 by Beckham's successor, Republican Augustus E. Willson.|$|E
5|$|In August 2007, a U.S. {{federal judge}} {{approved}} the French government's request to <b>extradite</b> Noriega to France after his release. Noriega appealed his extradition because he claimed France would not honor his legal {{status as a}} prisoner of war. In 1999, the Panamanian government sought the extradition of Noriega to face murder charges in Panama {{because he had been}} found guilty in absentia in 1995 and sentenced to 20 years in prison.|$|E
5|$|The first {{openly gay}} British footballer Justin Fashanu (1961–1998) spent his {{last night in}} Chariots Roman Spa. His suicide was due to press reports that the US {{authorities}} were planning to <b>extradite</b> him and charge him with sexual assault (there was in fact no warrant). His suicide note claimed that the sexual encounter had been consensual and that the youth contacted police only after Fashanu refused to pay him blackmail.|$|E
50|$|On 4 April 1946 Angelis was <b>extradited</b> to Yugoslavia {{and sentenced}} to 20 years for war crimes. He was then <b>extradited</b> to the Soviet Union {{and sentenced to}} two times 25 years. He was {{released}} in 1955 and repatriated to Germany.|$|R
50|$|After {{exhausting}} {{his legal}} options in Israel, a precedent-setting {{decision by the}} Supreme Court of Israel, Rosenstein was <b>extradited</b> to the U.S. on 6 March 2006, making him one of very few Israelis to ever be <b>extradited</b> for prosecution in another country.|$|R
50|$|Double criminality, or dual criminality, is a {{requirement}} in the extradition law of many countries. It states that a suspect can be <b>extradited</b> {{from one country to}} stand trial for breaking a second country's laws only if a similar law exists in the <b>extraditing</b> country.|$|R
5|$|The {{so-called}} NatWest Three — Giles Darby, David Bermingham and Gary Mulgrew — were extradited to the United States in 2006 {{on charges}} relating to a transaction with Enron Corporation in 2000 {{while they were}} working for Greenwich NatWest. It {{has been argued that}} the alleged crime was committed by British citizens living in the UK against a British company based in London and therefore, any resulting criminal case falls {{under the jurisdiction of the}} English courts. However, the Serious Fraud Office decided not to prosecute due to lack of evidence. There has been criticism that the Americans do not have to produce a prima facie case, or even a reasonable one, to <b>extradite</b> British citizens, whereas no such facility exists to <b>extradite</b> US citizens to the UK. On 28 November 2007 the three admitted one charge of wire fraud after a plea bargain. On 22 February 2008 they were each sentenced to 37 months in prison.|$|E
5|$|Panama asked France to <b>extradite</b> Noriega so {{he could}} face trial for human rights {{violations}} in Panama. The French government had previously stated that extradition would not happen before the case in France had run its course. On September 23, 2011, a French court ordered a conditional release for Noriega to be extradited to Panama on October 1, 2011. Noriega was extradited to Panama on December 11, 2011, and incarcerated at El Renacer prison to serve time for crimes committed during his rule.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} to Baghdad, Bahá'u'lláh tried to revive the Bábí community, mostly through correspondence, writing {{extensively}} to give the Bábís {{a new understanding of}} the Bábí religion, while keeping his perceived station as the one promised by the Báb and a Manifestation of God hidden. He was soon recognized by the Bábís, as well as government authorities, as the foremost Bábí leader, and there was {{a growing number of people}} joining the Bábí movement. He also gained sympathy from government officials and Sunni clerics. Bahá'u'lláh's rising influence in the city, and the revival of the Persian Bábí community, gained the attention of his enemies in Islamic clergy and the Persian government. The Persian government asked the Ottoman government to <b>extradite</b> Bahá'u'lláh to Persia, but the Ottoman government refused and instead chose to move Bahá'u'lláh from the sensitive border region to Constantinople.|$|E
50|$|In December 2005 the KNB <b>extradited</b> Rustam Chagilov, a {{suspected}} terrorist, to Russia. KNB officials detained an ethnic Uzbek and alleged member of HuT in Taraz, South Kazakhstan in April 2006. The KNB {{accused him of}} organizing an HuT cell Qoqon, Uzbekistan and <b>extradited</b> him to Uzbekistan.|$|R
50|$|Meziche was <b>extradited</b> to France in October 2013.|$|R
50|$|In {{matters such}} as Extradition of British nationals, courts must first consent and the Home Secretary must agree and sign an Extradition Order or the {{individual}} cannot be <b>extradited.</b> A recent {{example of this is}} computer-hacker and Aspergers syndrome sufferer Gary McKinnon being <b>extradited</b> to the United States. The courts decreed that he could be <b>extradited</b> and that it would not harm him. However the Home Secretary announced that she refused to sign the order as she believed it would harm his life rights and could lead to him committing suicide.|$|R
5|$|Although the German–Hungarian {{relations}} remained tense, {{no major}} confrontations {{occurred when the}} German crusaders marched through Hungary in June 1147. Two months later, Louis VII of France and his crusaders arrived, along with Boris Kalamanos who attempted {{to take advantage of}} the crusade to return to Hungary. Louis VII refused to <b>extradite</b> Boris to Géza, but prevented the pretender from coming into contacts with his supporters in Hungary and took him to Constantinople. Géza joined the coalition that Louis VII and Roger II of Sicily formed against Conrad III of Germany and the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos. The ancestors of the Transylvanian Saxons came to Hungary during Géza's reign. Western European knights and Muslim warriors from the Pontic steppes also settled in Hungary in this period. Géza even allowed his Muslim soldiers to take concubines.|$|E
5|$|Archbishop Lucas {{fell out}} of favor with Béla, and was ignored by {{him in the first}} years of his reign. Instead of Lucas, the Archbishop of Kalocsa baptized Béla's first-born son, Emeric, in 1174. However, {{administering}} sacraments to members of the royal family had always been the Archbishops of Esztergom's job. According to a Bohemian chronicle (Continuatio Gerlaci abbatis Milovicensis), Béla imprisoned his younger brother, Géza, but Géza escaped from prison and fled to Austria in 1174 or 1175. Stephen III's judge royal, Lawrence, accompanied Géza. When Henry Jasomirgott, Duke of Austria, refused to <b>extradite</b> Géza, Béla launched plundering raids into Austria, together with Soběslav II, Duke of Bohemia. Meanwhile, Béla sent reinforcements to Emperor Manuel to help him fight against the Seljuks, but their united forces suffered defeat in the Battle of Myriokephalon on 17 September 1176.|$|E
5|$|Mansoor Ijaz was {{involved}} in unofficial negotiations between the U.S. and Sudanese governments in 1996 and 1997 to obtain access to Sudan's intelligence files on Osama bin Laden and the early remnants of Al-Qaeda's network there after efforts to <b>extradite</b> bin Laden to the U.S. failed in early 1996. In the same year, the United States Congress imposed sanctions against Khartoum over allegations of harboring and abetting terrorist cells on its soil. In early 1996, CIA and State Department officials held secret meetings near Washington D.C. with Sudan's then-defense minister, El Fatih Erwa. In May 1996, bin Laden left Sudan for Afghanistan {{under pressure from the}} United States when the meetings failed to reconcile U.S. demands made of Khartoum about its record in aiding, abetting and harboring known terrorist groups and individuals.|$|E
50|$|One {{suspect in}} a June 2007 Ginza heist, a Montenegrin-national named Rifat Hadžiahmetović, {{travelling}} on a forged Bulgarian passport, {{was arrested in}} March 2009 by Cypriot police at Larnaca International Airport. Hadžiahmetović was due to serve a sentence in Cyprus for travelling on a forged passport before being <b>extradited</b> to Spain. He was <b>extradited</b> from Spain to Japan and, in September 2011, was sentenced to 10 years in prison. His accomplice, Radovan Jelušić, was arrested in Italy in 2010 over a separate crime, then was <b>extradited</b> to Montenegro to stand trial on 18 May 2012.|$|R

5|$|Sixteen indictments were {{returned}} {{in connection with}} Goebel's assassination, including one against deposed governor Taylor. In May 1900, Taylor fled to Indianapolis, Indiana, and the governor, James A. Mount refused to <b>extradite</b> him for trial. Three others charged in the assassination turned state's evidence. Only five of the sixteen went to trial; two of those were acquitted. Three men were eventually convicted for playing roles in Goebel's assassination. Kentucky's Secretary of State, Caleb Powers, was accused of being the mastermind behind the assassination. Henry Youtsey, the State Auditor of Kentucky, {{was said to have}} aided the assassin. James B. Howard, a participant in a bloody feud in Clay County was charged with being the actual assassin.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch {{were very}} keen {{to resume the}} lucrative trade with Japan which had been choked off {{in the wake of}} the dispute between Nuyts and Hamada at the behest of the Japanese {{authorities}} in Edo. All their overtures to the Japanese court failed, until they decided to <b>extradite</b> Pieter Nuyts to Japan for the shogun to punish him as he saw fit. This was an unprecedented step, and was representative of both the extreme official displeasure with Nuyts in the Dutch hierarchy and the strong desire to recommence Japanese trade. It also demonstrates the relative weakness of the Dutch when confronted by powerful East Asian states such as Japan, and recent historiography has suggested that the Dutch relied on the mercy of these states to maintain their position.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1842, {{popular opinion}} had {{turned against the}} Mormons. After an unknown assailant shot and wounded Missouri {{governor}} Lilburn Boggs in May 1842, anti-Mormons circulated rumors that Smith's bodyguard, Porter Rockwell, was the shooter. Though the evidence was circumstantial, Boggs ordered Smith's extradition. Certain he would be killed if he ever returned to Missouri, Smith went into hiding twice during the next five months, before the U.S. district attorney for Illinois argued that Smith's extradition to Missouri would be unconstitutional. (Rockwell was later tried and acquitted.) In June 1843, enemies of Smith convinced a reluctant Illinois Governor Thomas Ford to <b>extradite</b> Smith to Missouri on an old charge of treason. Two law officers arrested Smith, but were intercepted by a party of Mormons before they could reach Missouri. Smith was then released on a writ of habeas corpus from the Nauvoo municipal court. While this ended the Missourians' attempts at extradition, it caused significant political fallout in Illinois.|$|E
5000|$|Brian O'Rourke (1540?-1591), {{first man}} to be <b>extradited</b> within Britain ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{left the}} country after {{retiring}} from the Navy. After living for decades in Mexico, Cavallo was arrested and <b>extradited</b> to Spain in 2003, indicted under the principle of universal jurisdiction by judge Baltasar Garzon on charges of genocide and terrorism. It {{was the first time}} that a person had been <b>extradited</b> from one country to another for human rights crimes committed in a third. After changes in Argentina and renewal of prosecution of his case there, in early 2008 Cavallo was <b>extradited</b> to his homeland. He was convicted at trial of numerous crimes and in 2011 was sentenced to life in prison.|$|R
25|$|On July 20, 2001, Einhorn was <b>extradited</b> to the United States.|$|R
5|$|Capturing bin Laden {{had been}} an {{objective}} of the U.S. government from the presidency of Bill Clinton {{until his death in}} 2011. Ijaz asserted that in 1996, prior to bin Laden's expulsion from Sudan, the Sudanese government allegedly offered to arrest and <b>extradite</b> him to the United States. Khartoum's offer included detailed intelligence about the growing militancy of Hezbollah, Hamas, Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood and Iran's Revolutionary Guard, among other groups operating in the region. Ijaz further asserted that U.S. authorities allegedly rejected each offer despite knowing of bin Laden's involvement in training terrorists in Somalia, some of whom were allegedly involved in supporting militia members that downed U.S. Black Hawk helicopters in Mogadishu in October 1993. Any evidence of bin Laden's involvement in criminal activity against U.S. interests, such as training militia members who attacked U.S. troops in 1993, could have been grounds for indicting him far before Sudan expelled the Saudi fugitive in May 1996.|$|E
5|$|Josef Mengele was {{a medical}} officer {{assigned}} to Auschwitz concentration camp from 1943 {{until the end}} of the war. As well as making most of the selections of inmates as they arrived by train from all over Europe, he performed unscientific and usually deadly experiments on the inmates. He left the camp in January 1945 as the Red Army approached and was briefly in American custody in Weiden in der Oberpfalz, but was released. He took work as a farm hand in rural Germany, remaining until 1949, when he decided to flee the country; he acquired a Red Cross passport and left for Argentina; he set up a business in Buenos Aires in 1951. Acting on information received from Wiesenthal, West German authorities tried to <b>extradite</b> Mengele in 1960, but he could not be found; he had in fact moved to Paraguay in 1958. He moved to Brazil in 1961 and lived there until his death in 1979.|$|E
5|$|On 2 June 2003 U.S. {{authorities}} {{requested the}} Mexican government to <b>extradite</b> Francisco Rafael. A Mexican federal judge approved the request the following year, but the drug lord was extradited to the United States on 16 September 2006. He was flown from Matamoros, Tamaulipas, via helicopter {{and handed over}} to U.S. authorities in a prison in Brownsville, Texas, after a 10-year sentence in Mexico. He was then transferred {{to the state of}} California pending federal charges on drug trafficking. On 18 June 2007, he pleaded guilty to the possession and distribution of cocaine before U.S. District Judge Irma E. Gonzalez in a San Diego federal court. In his testimony, he admitted to selling about 250 grams of cocaine to a supplier who negotiated with an undercover Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent in an unnamed motel in San Diego in 1980. In October 2007, Francisco Rafael was sentenced to six years in prison and with possibility to parole in four months given the time he had already served in prison.|$|E
