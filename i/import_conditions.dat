Extraintestinal (muscular) {{sarcocystosis}} and intestinal sarcocystosis are the two known manifestations of disease in humans. In this series of six cases and review, we focus on the invasive extraintestinal ("muscular") form of sarcocystosis in humans. This disease, which until recently was rarely described, has become relevant particularly as an <b>imported</b> <b>condition</b> in travelers due to a recent series of outbreaks reported from Malaysia. Human intestinal sarcocystosis is ubiquitous across the globe. However, absolute numbers of probable and particularly confirmed cases are few, with only several hundred described to date. Characteristically, patients exhibit signs and symptoms either 1 - 2 weeks after exposure, or after 4 - 8 weeks. Whether people remain asymptomatic or develop disease apparently depends on the infecting species, host factors, and the inoculum size. The definitive host(s) remain uncertain, and identification of the animal reservoir(s) requires further research. A better understanding of the epidemiology of the disease, as well as its immunological determinants, is hampered by the lack of reliable serological diagnostic methods. Additionally, DNA seems to be contained very effectively within the encysted parasite, thereby rendering PCR detection unreliable. Physicians should suspect the condition in patients with suggestive symptoms and a possible history of exposure.

Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to analyze factors that determine export flows between Ethiopia and its trading partners using a gravity model approach. The research had used secondary data collected from different sources and covers periods from 1995 - 2010 for 14 importing countries, which implies that the data were panel. There was consideration of the importing capacity of the countries and successiveness of their <b>importing</b> <b>condition</b> for considering the countries as a sample. Different tests were applied in order to select the appropriate model to regress the gravity model. As of those tests, the research had adopted the random effects gravity model.

Coefficients of per capita GDPs of importer and exporter countries, population size of trading partners, and the distance between nations are significant and as to the expected sign. However, the coefficients of population sizes of Ethiopia and bilateral exchange rate between nations are significant and against the hypotheses. Based on the result, successive enlargement of the foreign per capita GDP directly result into increment in the export revenue of Ethiopia. In addition, the more populous the trading partners of Ethiopia, the higher its export volumes as they imports much to satisfy large domestic demands.

40|$|Translocation and folding of {{proteins}} imported into mitochondria are mediated by two matrix-localized chaperones, mhsp 70 and hsp 60. In order {{to investigate whether}} these chaperones act sequentially or in parallel, we studied their interaction with newly imported precursor proteins in isolated yeast mitochondria by coimmunoprecipitation. All precursors bound transiently to mhsp 70. Release from mhsp 70 required hydrolysis of ATP and did not immediately generate a tightly folded protein. For example, after imported mouse dihydrofolate reductase (a soluble monomeric enzyme) had been released from mhsp 70, folding to a protease resistant conformation occurred only after a lag and was much slower than the release. Under standard <b>import</b> <b>conditions,</b> no significant association of DHFR with hsp 60 could be detected. Similarly, newly imported hsp 60 subunit was released from mhsp 70 as an incompletely folded, unassembled intermediate which accumulated at low temperature and assembled to hsp 60 14 -mer at higher temperature in an ATP-dependent manner. Mas 2 p (the larger subunit of the MAS-encoded processing protease) first bound to mhsp 70, then to hsp 60, and only then assembled with its partner subunit, Mas 1 p. We propose that ATP-dependent release from mhsp 70 is insufficient to cause folding of imported proteins and that assembly of hsp 60 and Mas 2 p requires sequential, ATP-dependent interactions with mhsp 70 and hsp 60...|$|E

Most ACT presentations have high efficacy against P. vivax parasites; artemisinin-based combinations have shorter parasite and fever clearance times compared to chloroquine. ACT is as effective as chloroquine in preventing recurrent parasitaemia before day 28. Artemisinin-based combinations with long half-lives show significantly fewer recurrent parasitaemia up to day 63. The limited evidence available supports both the use of chloroquine and an ACT for P. ovale and P. malariae. ACT seems to be preferable for optimal treatment of P. knowlesi. ACT is at least equivalent to chloroquine in effectively treating non-falciparum malaria. These findings may facilitate development of simplified protocols for treating all forms of malaria with ACT, including returning travellers.

40|$|Although the {{majority}} of known vacuolar proteins transit through the secretory pathway, two vacuole-resident proteins have been identified that reach this organelle by an alternate pathway. These polypeptides are targeted to the vacuole directly from the cytoplasm by a novel import mechanism. The best characterized protein that uses this pathway is aminopeptidase I (API). API is synthesized as a cytoplasmic precursor containing an amino-terminal propeptide that is cleaved off when the protein reaches the vacuole. To dissect the biochemistry of this pathway, we have reconstituted the targeting of API in vitro in a permeabilized cell system. Based on several criteria, the in vitro import assay faithfully reconstitutes the in vivo reaction. After incubation under <b>import</b> <b>conditions,</b> API is processed by a vacuolar- resident protease, copurifies with a vacuole-enriched fraction, and becomes inaccessible to the cytoplasm. These observations demonstrate that API has passed from the cytoplasm to the vacuole. The reconstituted import process is dependent on time, temperature, and energy. ATP gamma S inhibits this reaction, indicating that API transport is ATP driven. API import is also inhibited by GTP gamma S, suggesting that this process may be mediated by a GTP-binding protein. In addition, in vitro import requires a functional vacuolar ATPase; import is inhibited both {{in the presence of}} the specific V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A 1, and in a yeast strain in which one of the genes encoding a V-ATPase subunit has been disrupted...|$|E

To identify intermediate steps during active import, we used sucrose density gradient centrifugation and blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) to identify complexes of translocon components associated with precursor proteins under active <b>import</b> <b>conditions</b> instead of arrested binding conditions. Importing precursor proteins in solubilized chloroplast membranes formed a two-peak distribution in the sucrose density gradient. The heavier peak was in a similar position as the previously reported Tic/Toc supercomplex and was too large to be analyzed by BN-PAGE. The BN-PAGE analyses of the lighter peak revealed that precursors accumulated {{in at least two}} complexes. The first complex migrated at a position close to the ferritin dimer (approximately 880 kDa) and contained only the Toc components. Kinetic analyses suggested that this Toc complex represented an earlier step in the import process than the Tic/Toc supercomplex. The second complex in the lighter peak migrated at the position of the ferritin trimer (approximately 1320 kDa). It contained, in addition to the Toc components, Tic 110, Hsp 93, and an hsp 70 homolog, but not Tic 40. Two different precursor proteins were shown to associate with the same complexes.

Biol. Chem. 277, 45704 – 45714]. To understand further the import strategy of Mtf 1 p, we investigated {{the import of}} the wild-type and N-terminal-truncated Mtf 1 p mutants synthesized in two different in vitro translation systems. These Mtf 1 p derivatives were generated either in the RRL (rabbit reticulocyte lysate) or in the WGE (wheat germ extract) translation system. Under the in vitro <b>import</b> <b>conditions,</b> the RRL-synthesized full-length Mtf 1 p but not the N-terminal-truncated Mtf 1 p product was efficiently imported into mitochondria, suggesting that the N-terminal sequence is important for its import. On the other hand, when these Mtf 1 p products were generated in the WGE system, surprisingly, the N-terminal-truncated products, but not the full-length protein, were effectively translocated into mitochondria. Despite these differences between the translation systems, in both cases, import occurs at a low temperature and has no requirement for a trypsin-sensitive mt receptor, mt membrane potential or ATP hydrolysis. Together, these observations suggest that, {{in the presence of}} certain cytoplasmic factors (derived from either RRL or WGE), Mtf 1 p is capable of using alternative import signals present in different regions of the protein. This appears to be the first example of usage of different targeting sequences for the transport of a single mt protein into the mt matrix...|$|E

We are concerned with respect to Sweden, in the analysis, especially because though it is already defined by EU for Europeans, it still varies in some countries, within Europe itself. In this research and experiment, we have brought useful revelations about its features in terms of power, comfort and cost. Likewise, our efforts have been to test its reliability on technical grounds, geographical conditions, people’s awareness and interests. Similarly, on effective grounds, ratio of bike users, <b>import</b> <b>conditions,</b> its growth and declines trends, and other influencing factors have been analyzed to understand e-bike’s possibilities in Sweden. To highlights e-bike’s features and importance, {{we have done a}} thorough investigation, taking comparative analysis with ordinary bicycles and normal vehicles, by using common elements like cost effectiveness, power efficiency, leisure service, easy accessibility, environment effects and so on. The findings have proven e-bikes to be the most effective solution on various grounds than any other transport alternatives especially in short distance and inner city traveling. In theoretical details on e-bikes, we have introduced details about the components applicable in e-bike, how they operate, their importance in terms of effectiveness with respect to power consumption and energy dispatching (motor capacity), quality of performance (types of components and features) and other comparative technical aspects. To understand the ground reality better, a short survey have been conducted to give some understanding about the awareness people are having regarding e-bike, their remarks towards this product, and based on their conclusions, our predictions report on its development and popularity chances in Sweden. While analyzing facts in general, we discovered that pedelecs for US may not be pedelecs for Sweden, because of standard varies from country to country. According to European classification standard, a pedelec must have the motor capacity up to 250 W, and must stop the motor when the speed is above 25 km/h. Speaking about the popularity of e-bike, In China the number of e-bikes sold reached up to 200 million, Germany is leading the way in Europe, therefore by the favorable situations available in Sweden, we can predict high potential in Sweden. The statistics data proved that Sweden is a bicycle country, where the amount of bicycles sold in 2012 was around 525, 000, among which 6, 500 were e-bikes imported the same year, suggesting its potential of growth being real. While analyzing mathematically e-bike’s functions, the four different calculations have been analyzed, keeping the weight of the person constant, but varying other common parameters that in use, in order to personify the drag in equation. By doing so taking the average power we have observed that it requires around 157 watts going up the hill when gradient is 4 %, at the speed around 10 Km/h. This result have been again tried to be verified in the experimental works as well. Based on these relevant information, in the experiment we have tested to find how much energy is dissipated in 2 minutes, taking six samples to authenticate our result. After not being successful taking angle measurements by riding outside or inside lab, it is achieved to some degree after applying it on running machine in gym with some complications. The result that have been achieved signifying that the voltage of the battery dropped to 37. 8 V, which {{in the beginning of the}} experiment have been recorded 40. 8 V when current applied have been around 4. 8 A. Angle measurement here precisely indicating the behavior of e-bike on various degrees of hillsides, because there comes the angle, which is formed in relation to the plane surface. When e-bike goes uphill it creates a positive angle, that is where we have our main concern, because then the difference in power consumption suddenly increases. The angle is also form when e-bike moves downhill but that is a negative angle, and cost no difference on power consumption, therefore we are giving emphasis on angle measurements to positive ones only. The battery that has been used in the experiment rated 36 V/ 9 Ah (i. e., 0. 324 kWh). Using this battery we have got the reading that it can hold (when completely charged) up to 32 Km distance (or 10 Wh/km), which is inversely proportional** to rider’s weight and drag. To sum up the experiment, the results have revealed that battery performance directly depends upon whether condition, weight of the rider and area where the cycle is ridden. These are among the discovered facts found in the experiment. When e-bike is used in hilly areas the speed slows down considerably to 13 km/hour, because of the disequilibrium force, and that is when excessive power is consumed. This part has been difficult to test correctly in the lab because to simulate the disequilibrium drag or pull could not be realized accurately, besides when it has been tried outdoor, we could not get stable running motor because of the pedal dependent motor system, it has also not been so fruitful for precise readings. Afterwards when it has been tried in the gym, the outcome is that at every angle the power consumed by the battery or the energy dissipated is around 3. 7 watt. Even then it is still not possible to calculate measurements that must be available in real like situations, because the other affected parameters like wind, friction, tire size, weather, rider’s weight is not possible to take into considerations. ___________ *Pedelec is the abbreviation form of "Pedal Electric Bicycle". The characteristics of Pedelec is to assist human input power rather than replacing it completely. **It is obvious that when the weight of the rider is heavy then it takes more power to draw him ahead, which directly indicates that the consumption of power rises, which again means that e-bike’s total covering distance is simultaneously reduced. This is also true when there is a drag, which stops e-bike’s natural flow on normal conditions. That again means it needs additional power to run, therefore when these factors rise, the efficiency of power subsequently declines, accordingly the total coverage distance of an e-bike.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we examine}} the impact of China’s growth on {{developing}} countries that specialize in manufacturing. Over 2000 - 2005, manufacturing accounted for 32 % of China’s GDP and 89 % of its merchandise exports, making it more specialized in the sector than any other large developing economy. Using the gravity model of trade, we decompose bilateral trade into components associated with demand <b>conditions</b> in <b>importing</b> countries, supply <b>conditions</b> in exporting countries, and bilateral trade costs. We identify 10 developing economies for which manufacturing represents more than 75 % of merchandise exports (Hungary, Malaysia, Mexico...|$|R
5000|$|By 1915 the British naval {{blockade}} had cut-off food <b>imports</b> and <b>conditions</b> deteriorated rapidly on {{the home}} front, with severe food shortages reported in all urban areas. The causes included the transfer of so many farmers and food workers into the military, combined with the overburdened railroad system, a shortage of coal, and the British blockade that cut off imports from abroad. The winter of 1916-1917 {{was known as the}} [...] "turnip winter" [...] (:de:Steckrübenwinter), because that vegetable, which was usually fed to livestock, was used by people as a substitute for potatoes and meat, which were increasingly scarce. Thousands of soup kitchens were opened to feed the hungry people, who grumbled that the farmers were keeping the food for themselves. Even the army had to cut the rations for soldiers. Compared to peacetime, about 474,000 additional civilians died, chiefly because malnutrition had weakened the body.Morale of both civilians and soldiers continued to sink, but using the slogan of [...] "sharing scarcity", the German bureaucracy ran an efficient rationing system nevertheless.|$|R

50|$|Problems were {{encountered}} {{opening the}} restaurant due to strict import laws at the time, which limited importing of overseas products {{that could be}} produced in New Zealand. The kitchen for the Porirua restaurant was <b>imported</b> on the <b>condition</b> that it was to allow local companies to reproduce it, and {{it was to be}} sent back after 12 months. However, the kitchen had been cemented into the floor and removing parts of it while still maintaining the restaurant operation meant it was impossible. The New Zealand affiliate eventually negotiated with the Corporation to import more kitchens in exchange for a large surplus of cheese the New Zealand Dairy Board (now Fonterra) had.|$|R
