40|$|This paper {{considers}} the changes between the Incoterms 2000 and the Incoterms 2010 from a risk management perspective, and highlights {{the challenges that}} traders may encounter when dealing {{with some of these}} terms. For example, the problematic FOB term and its use in containerisation is not likely to have been totally resolved, although the Incoterms 2010 have attempted to ameliorate the situation. The new terms DAT (<b>Delivered</b> <b>at</b> <b>Terminal)</b> and DAP (Delivered at Place) should be useful for cross border transactions within Customs Union blocs, such as the European Union. The paper concludes that the new Incoterms 2010 provide improved definitions, and more effectively contextualise the use of old terms that are out of synch with today’s modern practices. However, if traders continue to cling to their old habits and fail to update their delivery terms and arrangements to reflect contemporary practices, much of the work and progress that the ICC has put into this change process will be lost...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{military}} design project, further research was requested into an optimum method for delivering water from high altitude to a civilian population on the ground. This thesis explores current airdrop technology as well as three proposed methods of <b>delivering</b> potable water <b>at</b> <b>terminal</b> velocity in a safe manner. Both mathematical and empirical tests were performed on all three devices. Out of the three delivery methods discussed, an auto-rotating wing design was chosen as both the safest and most reliable means for <b>delivering</b> water <b>at</b> high altitudes. by Thomas Lipoma.
