40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: A high {{prevalence}} of osteoporosis is observed in Crohn's disease. Recent data {{have shown that}} <b>homocysteinaemia</b> is an important risk factor in low-bone mineralization and fracture. AIM: To look for an association between <b>homocysteinaemia</b> and low-bone mineralization in Crohn's disease patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-two consecutive patients (sex ratio M/F 0. 87; mean age: 36. 6 +/- 13. 2 years) were recruited between 2003 and 2005. Bone densitometry was performed on inclusion. The following parameters were analysed: age, sex, Crohn's Disease Activity Index, duration and extent of Crohn's disease, smoking status, corticosteroid treatment, immunosuppressive drugs, plasma homocysteine, folate and vitamin B 12 concentration. RESULTS: The {{prevalence of}} a high homocysteine level (> 15 micromol/L) was 60 %. Osteoporosis and low-bone mineralization observed in 26 (28 %), and 60 (65 %) patients, respectively. On a multivariate analysis, associated factors for osteoporosis and low-bone mineralization were respectively: hyperhomocysteinaemia (OR: 61. 4; CI: 95 : 23 - 250; P < 0. 001), and ileal Crohn's disease [OR: 13. 8; CI: 95 : 2. 5 - 150; P = 0. 036] for osteoporosis and hyperhomocysteinaemia [OR: 63. 7; CI: 95 : 8. 5 - 250; P < 0. 001] and disease duration of at least 5 years [OR: 11. 4; CI: 95 : 1. 31 - 99; P = 0. 039] for low-bone mineralization. Results were similar whichever site osteoporosis was detected. CONCLUSION: Hyperhomocysteinaemia was observed in 60 % of our Crohn's disease patients and was strongly associated with low-bone mineralization and osteoporosis (OR: 61. 4) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{a recent}} {{hypothesis}} [Selhub and Miller (1992) Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 55, 131 - 138], we proposed that <b>homocysteinaemia</b> arises from an interruption in S-adenosylmethionine's (AdoMet) coordinate regulation of homocysteine metabolism. The {{present study was}} undertaken to test a prediction of this hypothesis, that <b>homocysteinaemia</b> due to folate deficiency results from impaired homocysteine remethylation due to the deficiency and impaired synthesis of AdoMet, with the consequent inability of this metabolite to function as an activator of homocysteine catabolism through cystathionine synthesis. Rats were made folate-deficient by feeding them with a folate-free amino-acid-defined diet supplemented with succinylsulphathiazole. After 4 weeks, the deficient rats exhibited a 9. 8 -fold higher mean plasma homocysteine concentration and a 3. 2 -fold lower mean hepatic AdoMet concentration compared with folate-replete controls. Subsequent supplementation for 3 weeks of the folate-deficient rats with increasing levels of folate in the diet resulted in graded decreases in plasma homocysteine levels, accompanied by graded increases in hepatic AdoMet levels. Thus plasma homocysteine and hepatic AdoMet concentrations were inversely correlated as folate status was modified. In a second experiment, the elevation of plasma homocysteine in the deficient rats {{was found to be}} reversible within 3 days by intraperitoneal injections of ethionine. This effect of ethionine is thought to be exerted through S-adenosylethionine, which is formed in the liver of these rats. Like AdoMet, S-adenosylethionine is an activator of cystathionine beta-synthase and will effectively promote the catabolism of homocysteine through cystathionine synthesis. In crude liver homogenates of the rats treated with ethionine, cystathionine beta-synthase activity was 3 -fold higher than that measured in homogenates from vehicle-treated controls...|$|E

However, especially in young adults, there is possibility of significantly increased IS risk due to increased normal <b>homocysteinaemia,</b> i. e., hidden (pathologically dormant) prevalence within a healthy, normally-defined range. We performed a post-hoc modelling investigation on plasma total <b>homocysteinaemia</b> (THCY) in gender- and age-matched young patients in the acute IS phase. We evaluated relationships between THCY and prevalence of other potential risk factors in 41 patients vs. 41 healthy controls. METHOD: We used clinical methods, instrumental and neuroimmaging procedures, risk factors examination, total plasma homocysteine measurements and other laboratory and statistical modelling techniques. RESULTS: IS patients and healthy controls were similar not only for matching variables, but also for smoking, main vitamin status, serum creatinine and lipid profile. Patients with IS, however, had lower vitamin B 6 levels and higher THCY, fibrinogen and triglycerides (TGL). At multivariate stepwise logistic regression only increased THCY and TGL were significantly and independently associated with the risk for stroke (72 % model accuracy, p model= 0. 001). An increase of THCY with 1. 0 µmol/L was associated with 22 % higher risk of ischaemic stroke [adjusted OR= 1. 22 (95 %CI 1. 03 ? 1. 44) ]. In this way, novel lower cut-off value for HCY of 11. 58 µmol/L in younger patients has been revealed (ROC AUC= 0. 67, 95 CI% 0. 55 - 0. 78, p= 0. 009). CONCLUSION: The new THCY cut-off clearly discriminated between absence and presence of IS (sensitivity> 63 %, specificity> 68 %) irrespectively of age and gender and may be applied to better evaluate and more precisely define, as earlier as possible, the young patients at increased IS risk...|$|E
40|$|Mammalian {{methionine}} synthase (5 -methyl-homocysteine methyltransferase; EC 2. 1. 1. 13) is a cobalamin dependent {{enzyme that}} catalyzes {{the transfer of}} a methyl group from methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine, and generates methionine and tetrahydrofolate. Methionine synthase activity, in two classes of patients with defects in cobalamin metabolism, cblG and cblE, is compromised.

40|$|Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is {{the leading}} cause of death worldwide. CVD is causally related to "classical" risk factors such as {{elevated}} blood pressure, cholesterol, or glucose level and smoking. A causal role in the development of CVD is also suggested for numerous other factors, including an elevated plasma homocysteine concentration. Variation of <b>homocysteinaemia</b> is mainly due to genetic mutations and/or vitamin deficiency. The homocysteine concentration can be lowered with folate. Vitamin supplementation has thus been proposed in individuals with hyperhomocysteinaemia in order to reduce their CVD risk. On the other hand, population-based studies show little or no association between moderate hyperhomocysteinaemia and CVD risk. Nor has any randomised clinical trial clearly proven the efficacy of lowering the homocysteine concentration as a means of lowering the incidence of CVD. Hence at present it is inappropriate to recommend screening and treatment of hyperhomocysteinaemia in asymptomatic persons with or without other CVD risk. Until new evidence is available, clinicians should focus on better control of the "classical" risk factors for CVD...|$|E
40|$|Background In {{addition}} to the well established cardiovascular risk factors, evidence suggests a possible role of genetic and non-classical risk factors {{in the development and}} progression of atherothrombosis. We aimed to determine the relationship of classical and non-classical cardiovascular risk factors with candidate gene polymorphisms potentially involved in cardiovascular risk in the general Mediterranean population. Design Cross-sectional study. Methods We have determined the prevalence of classical (lipid profile, blood pressure, glycaemia, diabetes, smoking, body mass index, menopause and family history of coronary heart disease) and non-classical cardiovascular risk factors (infectious processes, <b>homocysteinaemia,</b> oxidative status, C-reactive protein, lipoprotein (a) and fibrinogen) in a population-based study. We analysed the relationship of these risk factors with the following five gene polymorphisms potentially involved in cardiovascular risk: ATP-binding cassette transporter A 1 -R 219 K, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) -a-L 162 V, Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) –HindIII, Paraoxonase (PON) 1 -Q 192 R, and Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -a-G- 308 A. Results We found PPAR-a-V and LPL-H+ alleles to be associated with decreased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c) concentration and with increased total cholesterol: HDL-c and triglyceride: HDL-c ratios.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Cobalamin C {{disease is}} the most common inborn error of {{cobalamin}} metabolism with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance and mutations within the MMACHC gene. Clinical features, including systemic, haematological and neurological abnormalities, usually occur {{in the first year of}} life. Adolescent and adult onset presentations are rare. METHODS: We report on the clinical, molecular and imaging features in three patients aged 40, 42 and 42 years at the last follow-up. We examine these cases together with eight previously described cases to determine the clinical and molecular features of the disease in adults. RESULTS: Mean age at onset of clinical symptoms was 26 years; clinical features included predominant neurological disturbances and thromboembolic complications. White matter abnormalities on brain MRI were sometimes observed. Most patients (eight of nine patients investigated) were compound heterozygotes for the 271 dupA mutation and a missense mutation. Intramuscular or intravenous hydroxycobalamin therapy stopped the progression of the disease and resulted in a better clinical outcome and favourable biological status in 7 / 9 treated cases, while the two untreated patients died quickly. CONCLUSIONS: As cobalamin C disease and related disorders of homocysteine metabolism are treatable conditions, <b>homocysteinaemia</b> should be included in the investigations of patients with progressive neurological deterioration, unexplained psychiatric disturbances or recurrent thromboembolic events...|$|E
40|$|Vitamin B 12 {{deficiency}} {{interferes with}} the normal pathway for homocysteine metabolism, even {{in the presence of}} adequate serum folate and pyridoxine. <b>Homocysteinaemia,</b> is an elevated level of homocysteine in plasma which has been established as a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disorders. However, there has been conflicting report from various research works on the role of Vitamin B 12 in the occurrence of major cardiovascular disorders. The study was set to determine the mean values of homocysteine, and correlate same with mean plasma levels of vitamin B 12 in the subjects, and to estimate the prevalence of anaemia in the stroke patients, using Haemoglobin concentration (Hb) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) as indices. One hundred (100) participants were recruited, comprising 40 clinically diagnosed stroke patients (hemorrhagic or thrombo-embolic), and 60 normal adults as control group.

We investigated folate status and homocysteine (Hcy) concentration in patients under 60 years on oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) for previous venous or arterial thrombosis and in healthy blood donors. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Thirty-nine patients (mean age 35. 2 years) on OAT for longer than 6 months and forty 44 healthy blood donors (mean age 36. 0 years) were evaluated. Diet, serum folate (SF), red blood cell folate (RCF), <b>homocysteinaemia,</b> vitamin B 12 levels and the mutation C 677 T of methylenetetrahydrofolate-reductase (MTHFR) gene were determined. RESULTS: The mean SF and Hcy concentrations were significantly higher in patients compared with blood donors (SF = 17. 7 versus 10. 5 nmol/L, P < 0. 0001; Hcy = 11. 7 versus 8. 9 micromol/L, P = 0. 009). Twelve out of 39 patients and 7 out of 44 blood donors were homozygous for the mutation C 677 T of MTHFR gene.

40|$|Background. Hyperhomocysteinaemia is an indepen-dent {{risk factor}} for the {{development}} of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, homocysteine induces endothelial dys-function by an increased inactivation of nitric oxide. In patients with chronic renal failure, the administration of folic acid or its metabolites reduces but does not normalize plasma homocysteine concentrations. Methods. We examined the effect of oral treatment with 15 mg/daily of 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate (5 -MTHF) for 12 weeks, on <b>homocysteinaemia</b> and endothelial function in 19 patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis and compared them, for the same period of time, to a control group of patients on peritoneal dialysis. Endothelial function was evaluated by B-mode ultra-sonography on the brachial artery. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was recorded during reactive hyper-aemia produced by the inflation of a pneumatic tourniquet. Nitroglycerine-mediated dilation (NMD) was recorded after sublingual administration of glyceryl trinitrate. Finally, oxidative stress was assessed by evaluating the conjugated dienes plasma levels. Results. Plasma homocysteine concentrations fell by 30 % after oral treatment with 5 -MTHF. Endothelial function improved significantly after oral 5 -MTHF treatment (13. 8 1. 2 % vs 11. 4 1. 4 %; P< 0. 02) while in the control group we observed a worsening of basal values from 12. 1 2. 66 % to 8. 7 2. 90 % (P< 0. 02). The conjugated dienes plasma levels did not change either. Conclusions. Our study demonstrated that 5 -MTHF administration improves endothelial dysfunction in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis.

40|$|BACKGROUND Stroke is a clinically-defined {{syndrome}} {{of rapidly}} developing symptoms or signs of focal loss of cerebral function {{with no apparent}} cause other than that of vascular origin. A previously unrecognised risk factor for stroke, which is prevalent and modifiable and may be causal, is elevated plasma homocysteine. To establish a correlation whether <b>homocysteinaemia</b> has any effect on incidence of young with stroke on our wards, we decided to undertake a cross-sectional observational study of patients admitted in the medical wards with first ever-ischaemic stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS The {{study was conducted in}} the Department of Biochemistry, Government Medical College, Calicut. 50 patients of age group 20 - 60 years, admitted to General Medicine Department with diagnosis of ischaemic stroke either clinically or proven by investigations were selected for the study. 50 age matched normal individuals also included. The period of study was one year. Homocysteine enzyme immunoassay was done by ELISA. The results were analysed statistically using Pearson chi-square test. RESULTS Serum homocysteine showed significant increase in patients than in the normal individuals. Mean fasting plasma homocysteine also showed statistically significant difference in both groups. Statistically significant positive correlation was present between plasma Homocysteine and MCV values collected from the subjects. CONCLUSIONS Our study supports that elevated levels of homocysteine might be an independent and modifiable risk factor for stroke in young in our country. Young patients presenting with ischaemic stroke need to be investigated for homocysteine level and treatment modalities to reduce homocysteine levels may help in preventing recurrence of ischaemic stroke...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the prevalence of hyperhomocysteinaemia in cardiac transplant recipients. Three groups of subjects were studied: 27 heart transplant recipients, 14 to 63 months (mean= 36 - 5) after transplantation; 10 patients with moderate chronic renal insufficiency without clinical evidence of vascular disease; 17 apparently healthy individuals. Twenty-five out of 27 transplanted patients had a coronaroangiography within 6 months of homocysteine measurement. Plasma homocysteine was measured both while the subject was fasting (tO) and 6 h after administration of 01 g. kg~ ' of methionine (t 6). Hyperhomocysteinaemia was present in 14127 fasting transplanted patients and after methionine loading. Mean plasma levels of homocysteine at tO were higher (P= 003) in transplanted heart recipients (15 - 4 ± 7 fimol. l~') than in the renal patients (9 - 9 ± 5 /xmol. l~') despite similar mean plasma creatinin. In eight transplanted patients with angiographic coronary abnormalities of the cardiac graft, <b>homocysteinaemia</b> was at tO 171 ± 9 jimol. l~ ' and at t 6 47 - 8 ± 25 /imol. l~'. In 17 transplanted patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries, plasma homocysteine levels were at tO, 13 - 2 ± 4 fimol. l~ ' and at t 6, 46 - 8 ± 25 fxmol. r'. We conclude that hyperhomocysteinaemia is common in transplanted heart recipients, and partly related to renal insufficiency.

OBJETIVO: Hiperhomocisteinemia tem sido postulada como um dos fatores de risco na patogênese do acidente vascular cerebral isquêmico (AVCI). Todavia, em adultos jovens existe a possibilidade de aumento significativo de risco de AVCI devido a aumento "normal" da homocisteinemia, "oculta" (patologicamente adormecida) dentro de uma variação definida como normal. Neste trabalho foi investigado um modelo post-hoc de dosagem de homocisteina no plasma (HC) em pacientes jovens com AVCI agudo pareados por gênero e idade. Foi avaliado também relações entre HC e prevalência de outros fatores de risco para AVCI em 41 pacientes e 41 controles normais. MÉTODO: Foi utilizado exame clínico, procedimentos instrumentais e de neuroimagem, exame de fatores de risco, dosagem da homocisteína no plasma, outros exames laboratoriais e análise estatística. RESULTADOS: Não foram encontradas diferenças quanto a presença de fumantes, dosagem de vitaminas, creatinina sérica e perfil lipídico entre os pacientes com AVCI e os controles normais. Todavia os pacientes com AVCI apresentaram diminuição de níveis de vitamina B 6 e aumento de homocisteína, fibrinogênio e trigliceridios. A análise multivariada de regressão logística mostrou diferenças significativas apenas para HC e trigliceridios independentemente associadas para fatores de risco para AVCI (72 % acuracia, p= 0, 001). Um aumento de homocisteína de 1, 0 µmol/L estava associado com aumento de 22 % de risco de AVCI [OR= 1, 22 (95 %IC 1, 03 - 1, 44) ].

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the range of}} plasma homocysteine values in a cohort of type 1 diabetic subjects and to analyse the relationship between homocysteine levels and chronic degenerative complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 71 type 1 diabetic inpatients admitted for poor glycaemic control and/or treatment of complications, especially macroangiopathic, were included in this study. Chronic diabetic complications, smoking prevalence, as well as current use of drugs were recorded, alongside fasting plasma homocysteine. RESULTS: Age and diabetes duration were 51 (34 - 63) and 23 (13 - 32) years respectively (median [percentile 25 - 75]). HbA(1) c was 9. 3 % (8. 2 - 10. 5). Homocysteine was 9. 2 (7. 1 - 13. 6) micromol/l, and 17 % of patients had elevated <b>homocysteinaemia</b> {{on the basis of}} a laboratory cutoff value of 15 micromol/l. Folic acid and vitamin B(12) levels were within the normal range. Univariate statistical analysis showed a significant positive association between homocysteine and age (P< 0. 001), diabetes duration (P< 0. 001), systolic blood pressure (P< 0. 001), plasma creatinine (P< 0. 001), cholesterol/HDL-C (P= 0. 021) as well as with retinopathy (P= 0. 016) and all complications (P< 0. 001), and a negative correlation with folic acid (P= 0. 004) and creatinine clearance (P< 0. 001).

40|$|Epidemiological and {{experimental}} data {{have shown that}} homocysteine may provoke vascular lesions and that moderate <b>homocysteinaemia</b> may constitute an independent risk factor for vascular disease. It is now documented that homocysteine damages human endothelial cells in culture, possibly by producing hydrogen peroxide in an oxygen-dependent reaction. In this study, we have examined the direct effect of this sulphur amino acid on pancreatic vascular resistance. Experiments were performed on the vascular bed of the rat isolated pancreas perfused at constant pressure; thus, any change in pancreatic vascular resistance resulted in {{a change in the}} flow rate. D,L-Homocysteine perfused for one hour at three different concentrations (200 [*]μM, 2 [*]mM, 20 [*]mM) did not induce any significant change in the flow rate per se. Homocysteine infusion for 30 [*]min at a concentration of 200 [*]μM or 2 [*]mM abolished the endothelium-dependent vasodilatation induced by acetylcholine (0. 05 [*]μM), but did not modify adenosine (1. 5 [*]μM) -induced vasodilatation. The effect of D,L-homocysteine (200 [*]μM or 2 [*]mM) cannot be ascribed to a direct antimuscarinic effect since 30 [*]min pretreatment of rat ileum with these concentrations did not significantly change the contractile effect of increasing concentrations of acetylcholine (0. 015 – 15 [*]μM). Preincubation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with D,L-homocysteine (0. 2 – 5. 0 [*]mM) had no significant effect on overall cell number or viability during 18 [*]h of incubation; the endothelial cells exposed to concentrations up to 5 [*]mM exhibited a spindle-shaped, whirled pattern.

40|$|<b>Homocysteinaemia</b> is an {{independent}} risk factor for atherosclerosis. The development of atherosclerosis involves monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP- 1) -mediated monocyte recruitment to the lesion site. The action of MCP- 1 is mostly via its interaction with MCP- 1 receptor (CCR 2), which is the major receptor for MCP- 1 {{on the surface of}} monocytes. The objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effect of homocysteine on CCR 2 expression in human THP- 1 monocytes. Cells were incubated with various concentrations of homocysteine for 6, 12, 24 and 48 h. The expression of CCR 2 mRNA was determined by nuclease protection assay and the CCR 2 protein was measured by Western immunoblotting analysis. The binding of MCP- 1 to CCR 2 as a functional receptor on the monocyte surface was determined by flow cytometry. Homocysteine (0. 05 - 0. 2 mM) significantly enhanced the expression of CCR 2 mRNA (129 - 209 % of the control) and CCR 2 protein (up to 183 % of control) in these cells after 24 h of incubation. Stimulation of CCR 2 expression was associated with a parallel increase in the binding activity of CCR 2 (129 - 191 % of control) as well as an enhanced chemotactic response of homocysteine-treated monocytes. Further investigation revealed that the levels of superoxide were significantly elevated in cells incubated with homocysteine for 12 - 48 h. The addition of superoxide dismutase, a scavenger of superoxide, to the culture medium abolished the stimulatory effect of homocysteine on CCR 2 expression as well as the binding activity of the receptor. The stimulatory effect of homocysteine on the expression of CCR 2 mRNA and the levels of CCR 2 protein was also observed in human peripheral blood monocytes. In conclusion, the present study has clearly demonstrated that homocysteine stimulates CCR 2 expression in monocytes, leading to an enhanced binding activity and chemotatic response. Homocysteine-induced superoxide formation might serve as one of the underlying mechanisms for this effect...|$|E
