50|$|Argyrodes flavescens, {{commonly}} called {{the red and}} silver <b>dewdrop</b> <b>spider</b> is a species of spider belonging to the family Theridiidae. It is widely distributed in Southeast Asia and {{is also found in}} Sri Lanka. Like other members of this genus, this species is a kleptoparasite, living on the web of a larger spider and feeding off its prey. A. flavescens most commonly inhabits the webs of araneids.|$|E
50|$|Spiders of {{the genus}} Argyrodes (Theridiidae), also called dewdrop spiders, occur worldwide. They are best known as kleptoparasites: they steal other spiders' prey. They invade and reside in their host's web even though they can spin their own webs. However, the {{relationship}} can sometimes be commensal or even mutual since the <b>dewdrop</b> <b>spider</b> can feed on small trapped insects that are not eaten by the host. Some species can even prey upon the host. Many species are black with silvery markings. Most species are relatively small. For example, A. incursus has a body length of 3-4.5 mm while A. fissifrons has a body length of about 12 mm.|$|E
50|$|Silver argiopes' webs {{are often}} {{also home to}} <b>dewdrop</b> <b>spiders</b> (Argyrodes). These are small kleptoparasitic or {{commensal}} spiders which feed on insects trapped by their host's web.|$|R
50|$|Most Argyrodes {{are found}} in the tropics {{although}} 15 species {{are found in}} the United States. <b>Dewdrop</b> <b>spiders</b> prefer large webs and clustered webs compared to small and isolated ones. Large webs tend to have more kleptoparasites than smaller ones. Isolated webs tend to have lesser number of kleptoparasites compared to clustered webs of the same size.|$|R
25|$|Like other arachnids, spiders {{are unable}} to chew their food, {{so they have a}} mouth part shaped like a short {{drinking}} straw that they use to suck up the liquefied insides of their prey. However, they are able to eat their own silk to recycle proteins needed in the production of new spider webs. Some spiders, such as the <b>dewdrop</b> <b>spiders</b> (Argyrodes), even eat the silk of other spider species.|$|R
25|$|Because of the {{relatively}} large size of web, they are often infested with kleptoparasitic split-faced silver spiders (Argyrodes fissifrons). While able to build webs of their own, <b>dewdrop</b> <b>spiders</b> (genus Argyrodes) prefer to live and even reproduce in the webs of other spiders, stealing prey in the process. They can be permanently associated with one web or move around between several other tent webs in the immediate vicinity. The size of the web is directly proportional {{to the number of}} A. fissifrons inhabiting them. The relationships can sometimes be commensal or even mutual, as A. fissifrons eat prey entangled in the webs that are too small for the larger double-tailed tent spiders. However, they often help themselves to food stores or even food {{in the process of being}} consumed by the hosts as well. Larger individuals are more audacious, but they usually stay on the tangle webs and out of the way of their hosts. Double-tailed tent spiders seem to tolerate their presence though they sometimes have to shove them away when they catch larger prey.|$|R
40|$|Plateau-Rayleigh Instability (PRI) is {{the well}} known {{phenomena}} of {{the breakup of}} a liquid column or cylinder. Such a process is integral to the operation {{of a range of}} natural and anthropogenic systems, such as gas-liquid and liquid-liquid separators, fuel cells, the accumulation of <b>dewdrops</b> on <b>spider</b> webs, and many more. Volume Of Fluid (VOF) methods, such as available in OpenFOAM, should be able to accurately resolve PRI in such systems. One such system, in which PRI is integral, is the filtration of oil or water aerosol mists using fibrous filters. In many cases, entrainment (or carryover) of liquid from fibers occurs. The mechanisms behind such entrainment are poorly understood. This work will validate the OpenFOAM VOF against classical PRI theory, both with and without a secondary fluid phase flowing through the system (e. g. air). Furthermore, the work will utilise the validated two-phase VOF solver to examine the phenomena of liquid reentrainment from mist filters...|$|R
