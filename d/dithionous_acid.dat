5000|$|The {{dithionite}} anion (S2O42−), is an oxoanion {{of sulfur}} [...] formally derived from <b>dithionous</b> <b>acid,</b> H2S2O4.|$|E
50|$|The {{sodium salt}} of <b>dithionous</b> <b>acid,</b> sodium dithionite, finds {{widespread}} use in industry as a reducing agent.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dithionous</b> <b>acid</b> is a sulfur oxoacid {{with the}} {{chemical}} formula H2S2O4. It is unstable in pure form, but its salts, known as dithionites, are stable.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dithionous</b> <b>acid</b> has {{not been}} {{detected}} either as a pure compound or in solution.Dithionite ions undergo both acid and alkaline hydrolysis to thiosulfate and bisulfite, and sulfite and sulfide, respectively ...|$|E
5000|$|It was {{initially}} {{assumed that the}} C2 symmetric structure HOS(=O)-S(=O)OH is the most stable among molecules with the formula [...] using ab initio calculations. The {{reason for this is}} the existence of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. It is now known that <b>dithionous</b> <b>acid</b> spontaneously decomposes to SO2 and S(OH)2.|$|E
5000|$|Sodium {{dithionite}} (also {{known as}} sodium hydrosulfite) {{is a white}} crystalline powder with a weak sulfurous odor. It is the sodium salt of <b>dithionous</b> <b>acid.</b> Although it is stable under most conditions, it will decompose in hot water and in acid solutions. It {{can be obtained from}} sodium bisulfite by the following reaction: ...|$|E
50|$|Sulfoxylic acid (H2SO2) (also {{known as}} hyposulfurous acid or sulfur dihydroxide)) is an {{unstable}} oxoacid of sulfur in an intermediate oxidation state between hydrogen sulfide and <b>dithionous</b> <b>acid.</b> It {{consists of two}} hydroxy groups attached to a sulfur atom. Sulfoxylic acid contains sulfur in an oxidation state of +2. Sulfur monoxide (SO) {{can be considered as}} a theoretical anhydride for sulfoxylic acid, but it is not actually known to react with water.|$|E
40|$|Most of the disulfuric acids like thiosulfuric acid (H 2 S 2 O 3), <b>dithionous</b> <b>acid</b> (H 2 S 2 O 4), disulfurous acid, (H 2 S 2 O 5), {{dithionic acid}} (H 2 S 2 O 6), disulfuric acid (H 2 S 2 O 7) and peroxydisulfuric acid (H 2 S 2 O 8) {{have never been}} {{obtained}} as pure compounds, {{because they are not}} stable at ambient temperatures. Therefore no experimental evidences are known for their structures. In this thesis, the synthesis and spectroscopical characterization of the disulfuric acids H 2 S 2 Ox (x = 3, 4, 6, 8) is presented. The compounds were obtained by the reaction of dry Na 2 S 2 Ox or K 2 S 2 Ox with anhydrous HF at − 60 °C. The protonated species H 3 S 2 Oy+MF 6 − (y = 3 - 8) were synthesized and characterized using the superacidic systems HF/MF 5 (M = As, Sb). The protonation of sulfuric acid, (H 3 SO 4 +) n(GeF 5 −) n, with the new superacidic system HF/GeF 4 is presented and gives evidence for the acid strength of this system. Moreover, the first single crystal structure of protonated dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), [(CH 3) 2 SOH+] 4 [Ge 3 F 16] 4 − is discussed. The protonated forms of the aminosulfonic acids NH 3 SO 3, NH 3 CH 2 SO 3, NH 3 C 2 H 4 SO 3 and methanesulfonamide (CH 3 SO 2 NH 2) are described. In this context, the first crystal structure of protonated taurine, NH 3 C 2 H 4 SO 3 H+SbF 6 − is discussed...|$|E
