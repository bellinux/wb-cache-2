Fenzl) is {{a species}} of Sagina, native to Europe, from Iceland south to Spain, and east to southern Sweden and Romania. It occurs on dry sandy or gravelly soils.|$|E
50|$|<b>Heath</b> <b>pearlwort</b> is a low-growing {{prostrate}} perennial plant {{forming a}} thick, dense mat with stems less than 10 cm long, and slender subulate (awl-shaped) leaves up to 1 cm long. The flowers are 4-5 mm diameter, with five white petals {{the same length}} as the green sepals; they are produced singly on erect stems 2-4 cm long. The seeds are smooth, brown, triangular shaped, 0.4-0.5 mm, produced in a capsule 2.5-3 mm long.|$|E
50|$|Brada Hill's {{escarpment}} has flourishing {{populations of}} plants {{suited to a}} thin dry soil, including maiden pink (Dianthus deltoides) and wild onion (Allium vineale) amidst red fescue (Festuca rubra), crested hair-grass (Koeleria macrantha) and early hair-grass (Aira praecox). Annual flora at the site include hare’s-foot clover (Trifolium arvense), knotted trefoil (T. striatum), forget-me-not (Myosotis spp.) and dove’s-tail cranesbill (Geranium molle) Perennial flora include common rock-rose (Helianthemum nummularium), biting stonecrop (Sedum acre) and meadow oat-grass (Avenula pratensis). A number of coarse grasses including false oat-grass (Arrhenatherum elatius), and herbs including red campion (Silene dioica), hogweed (Heracleum sphondylium) and common nettle (Urtica dioica), grow in isolated areas of deeper soil. <b>Heath</b> <b>pearlwort</b> (Sagina subulata), as well as grasses, wild onion and maiden pink grow amidst slab rocks which form the hill top. Despite proximity with the sea, maritime flora is not found at the site.|$|E
5000|$|A stunted {{woodland}} {{grows on}} a landslip {{from the top}} of the cliff (...) down to sea-level. Exposure to salt-laden winds has resulted in a tight wind-pruned canopy with trees from 1 to 8 metre high. Sessile oak (Quercus petraea) is the dominant species with pedunculate oak (Q. robur), birch (Betula spp), rowan (Sorbus aucuparia) and a few wild-service trees (Sorbus torminalis). Many of the trees are swathed in lichens and moss with 131 species of lichen recorded and there are a number of species that are largely confined to a few north Cornwall and Devon sites. One hundred and twenty flowering plants have been found including, bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), <b>heath</b> <b>pearlwort</b> (Sagina subulata), primrose (Primula vulgaris), sanicle (Sanicula europaea), sheep's sorrel (Rumex acetosella), small bristle club rush (Isolepis setacea), wild strawberry (Fragaria vesca), wood garlic (Allium ursinum) and wood vetch (Vicia sylvatica). Damp areas are dominated by bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), cow-wheat (Melampyrum pratense), tufted hair-grass (Deschampsia cespitosa) and the ferns broad buckler fern (Dryopteris dilatata) and royal fern (Osmunda regalis) are abundant. The hay-scented buckler-fern (Dryopteris aemula) is of interest. There was a heronry here in the first decades of the 20th-century.|$|E
