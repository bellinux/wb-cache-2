5|$|During Watts's lifetime, European culture {{had begun}} to {{question}} the concept of hope.

The Long <b>Depression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1870s wrecked both the economy and confidence of Britain, and Watts felt that the encroaching mechanisation of daily life, {{and the importance of}} material prosperity to Britain's increasingly dominant middle class, were making modern life increasingly soulless.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Depression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1930s exposed glaring {{weaknesses}} in federal-provincial financial arrangements.

By 1937, conditions had become so desperate that the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan faced bankruptcy. Finally, in August 1937, Prime Minister King appointed the Royal Commission on Dominion-Provincial Relations, popularly known as the Rowell-Sirois Commission. According to biographer Stephen Henderson, Macdonald {{played an important role in}} shaping the Commission's final recommendations.|$|E

Tropical Depression Four peaked at 35mph (55km/h) and dissipated on August 15.|$|E
5|$|The global {{economic}} <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early 1930s affected Ireland less {{because of the}} partial recovery following {{the civil war and}} because industry was protected behind tariff barriers established in the Anglo-Irish Trade War (1932–1938). The need for extra sea capacity was readily met by British and other foreign ships. Foreign ships were used, rather than preserving the home fleet. Banks were reluctant to lend to Irish industry, preferring British government gilts.|$|E

5|$|A low {{pressure}} area that developed over the southern Andaman Sea late in April moved north into the Bay of Bengal becoming the first <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year on May 2. The depression intensified {{under the influence of}} a high-level anticyclone and became a cyclonic storm the next day. The storm then turned to the northeast and strengthened into a severe cyclonic storm on May 4. Soon after this, it peaked with winds of 150km/h (90mph) and a well-defined eye formed. The storm made its landfall near Cox's Bazar in easternmost East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) early in the morning of May 7 and dissipated over western Burma that evening.|$|E
5|$|An area of {{disturbed}} weather {{within a}} persistent, broad trough across the southwestern Caribbean organized into the nineteenth tropical <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season by 06:00UTC on October20 about 195mi (315km) north of Cabo Gracias a Dios. The depression {{was slow to}} organize at first, affected by dry air and moderate shear from a trough over the Southeast United States and western Atlantic, but eventually strengthened into Tropical Storm Richard by 12:00UTC on October21 as it curved south and then west. Upper-level winds slackened over subsequent days, allowing the cyclone to attain hurricane intensity early on October24 and reach peak winds of 100mph (160km/h) by 00:00UTC the next day. Richard moved ashore near Gales Point, Belize, thirty minutes later. The system weakened rapidly once inland, degenerating into a remnant low by 00:00UTC on October26. Despite emerging over the Bay of Campeche, high wind shear prevented redevelopment and instead caused the feature to dissipate eighteen hours later.|$|E
5|$|Arlington was {{established}} in the 1880s by settlers and the area was platted as two towns, Arlington and Haller City. Haller City was absorbed by the larger Arlington, which was incorporated as a city in 1903.

5|$|Bute died in 1900 and his widow, the Marchioness, {{was given}} a life {{interest}} in Castell Coch; during her mourning, she and her daughter, Lady Margaret Crichton-Stuart, occupied the castle and made occasional visits thereafter. Production in the castle vineyards ceased during the First World War due to the shortages of the sugar needed for the fermentation process, and in 1920 the vineyards were uprooted. John, the 4th Marquess, acquired the castle in 1932 but made little use of it. He also began to reduce the family's investments in South Wales. The coal trade had declined after 1918 and industry had suffered during the <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1920s; by 1938, {{the great majority of}} the family interests, including the coal mines and docks, had been sold off or nationalised.|$|E
5|$|Cloth {{manufactured}} in England increasingly dominated European markets during the 15th and early 16th centuries.

Trade fell slightly during the serious <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mid-15th century, but picked up again and reached 130,000 cloths a year by the 1540s.

5|$|During the Great <b>Depression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1930s, Keynes spearheaded a {{revolution}} in economic thinking, challenging the ideas of neoclassical economics that held that free markets would, in the short to medium term, automatically provide full employment, as long as workers were flexible in their wage demands. He instead argued that aggregate demand determined the overall level of economic activity and that inadequate aggregate demand could lead to prolonged periods of high unemployment. Keynes advocated the use of fiscal and monetary policies to mitigate the adverse effects of economic recessions and depressions. Keynes' magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, was published in 1936.|$|E
