She became SNLs first female head writer.|$|E

500|$|During the January 7 debate, Huntsman was {{attacked}} by Romney for serving as President Barack Obama's Ambassador to China. In response, at the debate the following day, Huntsman responded: [...] "I was criticized last night by Governor Romney for putting my country first, I just want to remind the people <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire and throughout the United States that he criticized me while he was out raising money for serving my country in China, yes under a Democrat, like my two sons {{who are in the}} United States Navy.

500|$|On August 20, 2009, Lamoriello {{announced}} that the Devils would wear their classic red, white and green jerseys on their Saint Patrick's Day 2010 game against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Lamoriello stated, [...] "The original red, green and white jerseys {{are a part of}} our history <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Jersey. We have always been an organization that takes great pride in its tradition. This is something we believe our fans will enjoy for that one special night." [...] Martin Brodeur wore a special replica helmet of the one from his first NHL game, as the Devils defeated the Penguins, 5–2. The throwback jerseys were used seven more times, three of which took place on St. Patrick's Day. In 2014, they were used twice: January 26 against the Rangers in the 2014 NHL Stadium Series, and March 18 against the Bruins.|$|E
500|$|The {{election}} of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) in 1932 quelled the public affection for dictators. As the country became increasingly enthralled with FDR, who {{was featured in}} countless newsreels, it exhibited less desire for alternative forms of government. Many Hollywood films reflected this new optimism. Heroes for Sale, despite being a tremendously bleak and at times anti-American film, ends {{on a positive note}} as the New Deal appears as a sign of optimism. When Wild Boys of the Road (1933), directed by William Wellman, reaches its conclusion, a dispossessed juvenile delinquent is in court expecting a jail sentence. However the judge lets the boy go free, revealing to him the symbol of the New Deal behind his desk, and tells him [...] "hings are going to be better here now, not only <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York, but all over the country." [...] A box-office casualty of this hopefulness was Gabriel Over the White House, which entered production during the Hoover era malaise and sought to capitalize on it. By the time the film was released on March 31, 1933, FDR's election had produced a level of hopefulness in America that rendered the film's message obsolete.*Black, pg. 144.|$|E

500|$|Before All My Children {{offered him}} {{the role of}} Dimitri Marick, Nader already planned on working in both Los Angeles and New York.

[...] "She had an apartment here and I had been seeking out some theater <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York {{and would have been}} spending time both here and in L.A. So after we made the decision to go ahead with that game plan, this offer (Dimitri) came on the table and when we worked out all the figures moneywise it was a great opportunity." [...] Despite Nader's prime time success as Dynasty's Dex Dexter, he did not look down on daytime television. [...] "The {{fact of the matter is}} we're in a different era," [...] he said. [...] "And if you look at the cutbacks in Hollywood, being on a soap is not of any less or more value than being in any other medium at this time." [...] Another factor that contributed to his decision to join All My Children was the actors strike. He intended to stay on All My Children for a year. That year turned into more because the actor fell in love with New York.|$|E

The union's constitution required the convention to be held in May, but AFL leaders (including the influential Executive Council member, Matthew Woll) demanded that Shachtman delay the meeting until such time as he could guarantee that a large majority of delegates would be pro-AFL. [...] "As you well know, your International Union is today being financed to a great part by the reorganizing activities going on <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York City," [...] Woll and two others wrote Shachtman, [...] "and that without this income your organization would be practically bankrupt."

2500|$|In 1990, DeVille made Victory Mixture, {{a tribute}} album of classic New Orleans soul and R which he {{recorded}} {{with some of}} the songs' original composers. The album was recorded without the use of overdubbing or sound editing with the goal of capturing the spirit of the original recordings.I got all the original guys to come back in, like Earl King, Dr. John and Eddie Bo. Allen Toussaint played side piano. I brought in the rhythm section of The Meters on a couple of cuts. We call it the [...] "little" [...] record. It's funny, because I was just trying to get them money, the writers of the songs, 'cause they all got ripped off in the 1950s and 1960s. They were all fascinated, and Dr. John (who had played on DeVille's 1978 album Return to Magenta and who DeVille knew from his association with Doc Pomus) convinced them that they wouldn't get ripped off by this northern white boy. That's when I crossed over to being a local <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Orleans. We were all pleased with it. It's recorded the way it was originally done back then. It's live with no overdubs anywhere, no digital, no editing. We played the song several times and just picked the best take, the one that was the most natural. It's on Fnac/Orleans Records. I'm really proud of that one. Victory Mixture was recorded for a small independent label, Orleans Records, which licensed it to Sky Ranch (Fnac Music) in France. [...] "It sold over 100,000 units in Europe very quicklyour first gold disc," [...] said Carlo Ditta, founder of Orleans Records and the producer of Victory Mixture.|$|E
