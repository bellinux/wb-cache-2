5000|$|The above equation, when plotted with {{quantity}} <b>demanded</b> (...) on the ''''-axis {{and price}} (...) on the -axis, gives the <b>demand</b> curve, {{which is also}} known as the <b>demand</b> schedule. The downward sloping nature of a typical <b>demand</b> curve illustrates the inverse relationship between quantity <b>demanded</b> and price. Therefore, a downward sloping <b>demand</b> curve embeds the law of <b>demand.</b>|$|R

For example, if the <b>demand</b> for a good such as wheat increases, then this leads to an increase in the <b>demand</b> for labour. For another example, <b>demand</b> for steel leads to derived <b>demand</b> for steel workers, as steel workers are necessary for the production of steel. As the <b>demand</b> for steel increases, so does its price. The increase in price means manufacturers of steel can gain more in revenue if they produce more steel, thus leading to a higher <b>demand</b> for the resources involved in producing steel.|$|R

40|$|Background and Objectives: Simultaneous {{exposure}} to time, cognitive, and emotional <b>demands</b> is {{a feature of}} the work environment for healthcare workers, yet effects of these common stressors in combination are not well established. Design: Survey data were collected from 125 hospital employees (Sample 1, Study 1), 93 ambulance service employees (Sample 2, Study 1), and 380 aged care/disability workers (Study 2). Methods: Hierarchical multiple regressions were conducted. Results: In Sample 1, high cognitive <b>demand</b> exacerbated high emotional <b>demand</b> on psychological strain and job burnout, whereas the negative effect of high emotional <b>demand</b> was not present at low cognitive <b>demand.</b> In Sample 2, a similar pattern between emotional <b>demand</b> and time <b>demand</b> on stress-remedial intentions was observed. In Study 2, emotional demand[*]×[*]time <b>demand</b> and time demand[*]×[*]cognitive <b>demand</b> interactions again revealed that high levels of two <b>demands</b> were stress-exacerbating and low levels of one <b>demand</b> neutralized the other. A three-way interaction on job satisfaction showed the negative impact of emotional <b>demand</b> was exacerbated when both time and cognitive <b>demands</b> were high, creating a “triple disadvantage” of job <b>demands.</b> Conclusions: The results demonstrate that reducing some job <b>demands</b> helps attenuate the stressful effects of other job <b>demands</b> on different employee outcomes...|$|R
