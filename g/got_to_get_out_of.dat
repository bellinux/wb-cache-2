5|$|What's So Amazing About Grace? sold well at {{secular and}} Christian stores. Its {{popularity}} in the United Kingdom grew in 2003, when the impending Iraq War boosted sales of religious literature in the country. That March, it was the seventh-bestselling religious book in the UK, behind Rick Warren's The Purpose Driven Life, John Ortberg's If You Want to Walk on Water, You've <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> the Boat and Eugene H. Peterson's The Message. What's So Amazing About Grace? is Yancey's best-known book, having sold more than 15million copies by 2006. Initially, the book was especially popular among baby boomers. Its popularity helped increase sales of Yancey's 2000 book Reaching for the Invisible God, which appeared on religion bestseller lists immediately after publication. What's So Amazing About Grace? {{is one of several}} books by Yancey that have become international bestsellers.|$|E
500|$|According to Experience bassist Noel Redding, Hendrix {{told him}} it was about Hendrix's girlfriend in high school, Betty Jean Morgan. [...] Jimi's brother, Leon Hendrix, also felt that it was about Betty Jean, but also {{included}} her sister Maddy, although their house was brown. Shadwick suggests that the song was inspired by Linda Keith, Keith Richards' then-girlfriend and early Hendrix supporter. [...] Keith referred to her friend's Manhattan apartment, with its red velvet walls and decor, as the [...] "red house", and the two frequently stayed there during the summer of 1966. In London in 1970, Hendrix met up with Keith and when he performed [...] "Red House" [...] at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival, he dedicated the song to her and added [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> here, because my Linda don't live here no more" [...] to the lyrics. However, Billy Cox, longtime friend and bassist for Hendrix's post-Experience groups, explained, [...] "As far as I know, 'Red House' didn't have any significance in reference to a particular person, place or thing. [...] It was just a blues number that Jimi put together".|$|E
2500|$|Two acquaintances of Markhasev, Sara Peters and Michael Chang, {{testified against}} {{him at the}} grand jury. Peters and her boyfriend, Eli Zakaria (who refused to testify, invoking his Fifth Amendment right to not {{incriminate}} himself), were with Markhasev {{on the night of}} the murder and were high on cocaine and heroin. She testified they had stopped to use the pay phone at a park-and-ride lot about [...] from where Cosby had pulled over to fix his flat tire. Peters testified that while Zakaria was on the phone, Markhasev walked off without saying where he was going. Within a few minutes, Peters heard a loud noise like a car backfiring, and Markhasev ran back to the car, saying, [...] "Let's go. We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> here. Let's go." [...] Markhasev refused to tell them what had happened, but they stopped at a wooded area that matched the description of where the murder weapon was later discovered.|$|E

6000|$|... "We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> somehow," [...] Sir Henry declared. [...] "Mills, my {{oilskins}} and flask at once. I sha'n't {{change a}} thing, {{but you might}} bring a cardigan jacket and the whisky and soda." ...|$|R

2500|$|I became {{terrified that}} I {{was going to}} be a full-time, bomb-throwing {{terrorist}} if I stayed [...] because it was the beginning of really bad times in America. It was '66–'67, it was the first police riot in Los Angeles.... In college my major was political science, so my brain worked that way.... And I drove around this little English Hillman Minx—top down—and every night I'd be hauled over by the cops. Up against the wall, and all this stuff. They had this monologue with me; it was never a dialogue. It was that I was a long-haired drug addict living off some rich guy's foolish daughter. And I said, [...] "No, I work in advertising. I make twice as much as you do." [...] Which is a stupid thing to say to a cop....And it was like an epiphany. I suddenly felt what it was like to be a black or Mexican kid living in L.A. Before that, I thought I knew what the world was like, I thought I knew what poor people were, and then suddenly it all changed because of that simple thing of being brutalized by cops. And I got more and more angry and I just felt, I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> here—I'm a better cartoonist than I am a bomb maker. That's why so much of the U.S. is still standing.|$|E

6000|$|... "We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> here," [...] was Sam's comment. Already {{they were}} {{standing}} in water up to their ankles. [...] "We've got to find higher ground." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out!</b> I've <b>got</b> to!" [...] he told himself, {{over and}} over again. [...] "I can't stay here!" [...] And then he tried to climb the rocks {{in front of him}} once more.|$|R

6000|$|... "She's {{done more}} than that, Jack. She's waked me up. She's shown me that I can't afford to ride trail and camp and cook and fight fire any more. I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> {{into the world and}} rustle a home that a girl like her can be happy in. I'm started at last. I want to do something.

6000|$|Above the darky's head, {{elevated}} trains roared on the Fifty-third Street trestle, and up Broadway streaked a stripped motor-car, {{all steel chassis}} and grease-mottled board {{seat and}} lurid odor of gasoline. But sparrows splashed in the pools of sunshine; in a lull the darky's voice came again, chanting passionately, [...] "In de spring, spring, spring!" [...] and Carl clamored: [...] "I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> to-day. Terrible glad it's a half-holiday. Wonder if I dare telephone to Ruth?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now listen. We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{this joint}} {{as quiet as}} mice. It would spoil the {{surprise}} if they was to hear us and come out and ask what we were doing. Get that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He hasn't done anything, and I'm {{going to}} stop it. He's {{got to get a}} ship, and he's <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this. And Zerrilla needn't come back to work till he does. I'm done with you all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this," [...] he said. His {{voice sounded}} like a man's whose throat has been {{scorched}} by many and long potations. It frightened him, but he limply lifted a shaking paddle and shoved off.|$|E
6000|$|... "That doesn't {{make any}} difference. I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> him <b>out</b> {{and send him}} away. Head him for Arizona where we're going.... Is it a real jail?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He can't aid himself, that is sure," [...] murmured Dave. [...] "Roger, we have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> him <b>out</b> of that--before {{that water}} pouring over his {{shoulder}} carries him down!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know; but we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> him <b>out</b> of town by the {{shortest}} cut, an' I reckon that'll be Thirty-fourth Street Ferry. How {{much money you}} fellers got?" ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{stricken}} {{youth was}} not listening. [...] "Just think, Gil, she's {{been doing all}} this for me! I knew she claimed to have messages, but I didn't know that I was living on money earned in that way. You see, we own some houses in La Crescent, and I just {{took it for granted}} that our living came from them." [...] He was white with pain now. [...] "This ends my career here.

6000|$|... "Settin' a {{fine example}} to the children," [...] Mr. Higginbotham snorted, suddenly, in the silence for which his wife was {{responsible}} and which he resented.

5000|$|Ryan O'Neal {{had made}} two {{pictures}} previously with Bogdanovich but said Nickelodeon was a [...] "terrible experience" [...] and that Bogdanovich [...] "began no longer using writers... Orson Welles quit {{one week before}} he was {{to appear in the}} film... Bogdanovich rewrote what originally was a tough little script about Hollywood into a farcical series of precious little jokes. I tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the picture.

6000|$|... "Excuse my calling so early," [...] he began, with {{tranquil}} drawl, [...] "but I'm {{going back}} to the West to-night.
