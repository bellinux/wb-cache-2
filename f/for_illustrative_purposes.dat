2500|$|Unheard of in {{the modern}} era, but common during the early 20th Century in North America, a [...] "newspaper {{decision}} (NWS)" [...] might be made after a no decision bout had ended. A [...] "no decision" [...] bout occurred when, by law or by pre-arrangement of the fighters, if both boxers were still standing at the fight's conclusion {{and there was no}} knockout, no official decision was rendered and neither boxer was declared the winner. But this did not prevent the pool of ringside newspaper reporters from declaring a consensus result among themselves and printing a newspaper decision in their publications. Officially, however, a [...] "no decision" [...] bout resulted in neither boxer winning or losing. Boxing historians sometimes use these unofficial newspaper decisions in compiling fight records <b>for</b> <b>illustrative</b> <b>purposes</b> only.
