50|$|At Augsburg in 1573, a German {{military}} engineer by {{the name}} of Samuel Zimmermann invented an extremely effective mine known as the Fladdermine. It consisted of a fougasse (or later, sometimes a shell fougasse, that is, a fougasse loaded not with stones but with early black powder mortar shells, similar to large black powder hand grenades) activated by a snaphance or flintlock mechanism connected to a tripwire on the surface. Combining the effects of a tripwire activated bounding <b>fragmentation</b> <b>mine</b> with a cluster bomb, it was devastating to massed attackers but required high maintenance due to the susceptibility of black powder to dampness. Consequently, it was mainly employed in the defenses of major fortifications, in which role it continued to be used until the 1870s.|$|E
5000|$|The normal {{method of}} firing {{was to use}} a burning torch or slow match to ignite a saucisson (French for [...] "big sausage", a cloth or leather tube waterproofed with pitch and filled with black powder) leading to the main charge. This had {{numerous}} disadvantages; the firer was obvious to the attacking enemy, and had to race to get clear after lighting the fuse. The black powder was also very susceptible to moisture, and might not work at all. In 1573 Samuel Zimmermann devised an improved method which incorporated a snaphance (or later, flintlock mechanism) into the charge and connected its trigger to the surface with a wire. This was more resistant to moisture, better concealed, and enabled the firer to be further away. It also enabled the fougasse to be tripwire activated, turning it into an anti-personnel <b>fragmentation</b> <b>mine.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{shrapnel}} {{from these}} mines can even disable some armoured vehicles, by puncturing their tires and—in {{the case of}} soft-skinned vehicles—also penetrating the skin and damaging internal components or injuring personnel. Because <b>fragmentation</b> <b>mines</b> generally contain a much larger charge than blast mines, they can cause severe damage to an unarmoured vehicle which runs directly over one.|$|R

50|$|During the Liberation War of the 1970s Rhodesian forces laid an {{extensive}} series of minefields along the borders between Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia) and Zambia and Mozambique {{in an attempt}} to prevent insurgents from moving {{in and out of the}} country for training and re-supplies. Initially anti-personnel mines were laid in very dense belts (reportedly 5,500 mines per kilometer of frontage) to form a “cordon sanitaire”. Over time the cordon sanitaire was breached or was subject to erosion and so, in many sections, a second belt of directional <b>fragmentation</b> <b>mines</b> guarded by anti-personnel mines were laid “inland” of the cordon sanitaire. Anti-tank mines were used extensively by the insurgents but the majority were either detonated by vehicles or were cleared in the years immediately after the war.|$|R

50|$|The MON-90 is a claymore shaped, plastic bodied, {{directional}} type of {{anti-personnel mine}} designed and {{manufactured in the}} Soviet Union.

2500|$|Deminers may {{be issued}} {{personal}} protective equipment (PPE) such as helmets, visors, armoured gloves, vests and boots, {{in an attempt to}} protect them if a mine is set off by accident. IMAS specifies standards for such equipment but draws attention to its limitations and states that at close quarters, antipersonnel <b>fragmentation</b> <b>mines</b> and antitank mines overmatch PPE currently available. PPE can afford significant protection against antipersonnel blast mines, and these are more common. Related technologies that have been developed to improve safety include large, pillow-like pads strapped to the bottoms of shoes that distribute weight and dull the impact of footsteps, as very slight disturbances of the ground can tip off old, unstable, or intentionally sensitive mine triggers. [...] First developed in 1954 by the British as overshoes that are first inflated by the combat soldier, this specialized footwear has become a needed item for some demining operations.|$|R
