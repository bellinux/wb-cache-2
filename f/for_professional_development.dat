40|$|ABSTRACT There {{are very}} few {{credible}} frameworks for evaluation of teacher education programmes. The authors advocate {{the application of a}} paradigm originally designed for educational software assessment as a framework <b>for</b> reviewing teacher <b>professional</b> <b>development.</b> The framework is based on a situated view of cognition and this ensures an authentic approach. Five commonly observed foci <b>for</b> teacher <b>professional</b> <b>development</b> are considered in terms of the paradigm, leading to consideration of the comprehensiveness of <b>professional</b> <b>development</b> programmes. The analysis is illustrated by discussion of the <b>professional</b> <b>development</b> programme in place in a school. The analysis strongly suggests that a school-focused approach is appropriate <b>for</b> teacher <b>professional</b> <b>development</b> in the information technology area...|$|R

Prior to the 2000–01 basketball season, the center completed an expansion project which began in October of 1998 in which 34 luxury suites and 468 club seats at mid-level in the arena were added. In addition, the upper level seating was configured to offer better viewing and additional concession stands and restrooms were added. The Spotlight Grill, a 450-seat arena-view restaurant includes an outdoor patio and ledge seating for viewing arena events. The multi-purpose facility, which opened its doors in 1981, covers over 22 acres in the heart of Tallahassee's downtown district.

40|$|In this paper, {{the author}} argues <b>for</b> the <b>professional</b> <b>development</b> of {{teachers}} to be based upon systematic action research undertaken as a collegial activity within {{the culture of the}} school.

SNSs like LinkedIn, a social networking website geared towards companies and industry professionals looking to make new business contacts or {{keep in touch with}} previous co-workers, affiliates, and clients.

Much of the early research on online communities assume that individuals using these systems would be connecting with others outside their preexisting social group or location, liberating them to form communities around shared interests, as opposed to shared geography. Other researchers have suggested that the professional use of network sites produce [...] "social capital". For individuals, social capital allows a person to draw on resources from other members of the networks to which he or she belongs. These resources can take the form of useful information, personal relationships, or the capacity to organize groups. As well, networks within these services also can be established or built by joining special interest groups that others have made, or creating one and asking others to join.|$|E
