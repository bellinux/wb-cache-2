40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the US Consumer Product Safety Commission’s (CPSC) Safety Standard for Cigarette Lighters, which requires that disposable cigarette lighters be resistant to operation by children younger than age 5. Methods: Fire data on children playing with lighters were solicited from selected US fire departments for incidents occurring from 1997 – 99, to identify the proportion of such fires caused by children younger than age 5 playing with cigarette lighters. These data were compared with similar data from 1985 – 87. An odds ratio was used to determine if there was a significant decrease in cigarette lighter fires caused by children younger than age 5 compared to children ages 5 and older. To estimate fires that would have occurred without the standard, the odds ratio, adjusted for population, was applied to 1998 national estimates of fires occurring. National estimates of 1998 <b>fire</b> <b>losses</b> were based on data from the National Fire Incident Reporting System and the National Fire Protection Association to which the 1997 – 99 age and lighter type distributions were applied. The difference between the <b>fire</b> <b>losses</b> that would have occurred and those that did occur represented <b>fire</b> <b>losses</b> prevented. Results: In the post-standard study, 48 % of the cigarette lighter fires were started by children younger than age 5, compared with 71 % in the pre-standard study.

50|$|America Burning is a 1973 report {{written by}} the National Commission on Fire Prevention and Control to {{evaluate}} <b>fire</b> <b>loss</b> in the United States and to make recommendation to reduce loss and increase safety of citizens and firefighting personnel. The report concluded that fire prevention and fire safety education for the public were critical to reducing the losses associated with fires, and that firefighters also needed to be better educated for their jobs in fighting fires. As {{a result of the}} report, in 1974 the United States Congress passed the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 leading to the formation of the U.S. Fire Administration, the National Fire Academy, the National Fire Incident Reporting System and the Center for Fire Research within the National Bureau of Standards. One of the most critical findings of the report was that the high death rate among American firefighters should be addressed. As a result of this report, fire fighting agencies planned life and property loss-reduction strategies for handling incidents before they occurred.|$|E
50|$|Bound Brook's {{downtown}} flooding led {{to several}} out-of-control fires over its history, including {{the fires of}} 1881 and 1887 {{which led to the}} formation of the Bound Brook Fire Department, and another major fire in 1896. During Hurricane Floyd in 1999, a fire began in Otto Williams Harley Davidson on Main Street. With the building cut off by flood water, the fire spread quickly to two other structures before the Bound Brook Fire Department could contain it, then under the command of Chief Richard S. Colombaroni. Using fire boats from the New York City Fire Department as well as extensive help from mutual aid companies, the fire was stopped before two other buildings on Main Street and others nearby on Mountain Avenue, could be affected. During the April 2007 Nor'easter, the Bound Brook Fire Department stopped another fire from spreading through an area of close residential construction. Under the command of Chief James Knight, and again with the assistance of mutual aid companies including the Finderne Fire Department, <b>fire</b> <b>loss</b> was restricted to three residential buildings.|$|E
50|$|On December 2, 2012, the {{original}} lodge was entirely {{destroyed by a}} fire while it was under renovation. At {{the time of the}} fire, there were five workers staying in the building, all of whom escaped safely. After a delay of 15 minutes during which the lodge's occupants attempted to suppress the fire themselves, the fire was reported at 4:27 am as it quickly spread through the building. The first fire truck arrived on the scene at 4:37 am; in total, 40 vehicles were involved in battling the blaze, including two aerial trucks and 15 tanker trucks, until <b>fire</b> <b>loss</b> was reported as stopped at 7:30 am. With no fire hydrants in the area, firefighters had to use the surrounding lakes as sources of water instead. Furthermore, winds blowing in from Lake Michigan at 35 mph fueled the flames and further increased the difficulty of the firefighting operation. In all, 77 firefighters and equipment from 15 different fire departments participated in the response. While they were not able to prevent the destruction of the 110-year-old main lodge, they were able to successfully protect the other buildings in the immediate vicinity.|$|E
