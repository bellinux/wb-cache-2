2500|$|Lola Williamson, who {{practiced the}} TM-Sidhi program until 1981, {{wrote a book}} called Transcendent in America: Hindu-Inspired Meditation Movements as New Religion. In the book, she cites two former professors who in the late 1980s [...] "testified against the {{research}} practices conducted at the university". In the book, she writes that former MUM professor of economics and business law Anthony DeNaro alleged in 1986 that there was [...] "a very serious and deliberate pattern of fraud ... designed to misrepresent the TM movement as a science (not a cult), and fraudulently claim and obtain tax exempt status with the IRS". Williamson writes in her book that Dennis Roark, former <b>dean</b> <b>of</b> <b>faculty</b> and chair of the physics department in the 1970s, was a [...] "witness to routine suppression of negative data" [...] and that Roark wrote in a 1987 letter that it was his [...] "belief that the many scientific claims both to the factual evidence of unique, beneficial effects of T.M. and physics are not only without any reasonable basis, but in fact in many ways fraudulent". Roark said [...] "he had questioned" [...] MIU faculty member Michael Dillbeck regarding his studies of brain wave coherence using EEG measurements during practice of the TM-Sidhi program, and that Dilbeck confirmed {{that it was impossible to}} make EEG measurements while the subjects are moving. Williamson writes in her book that Roark questioned other investigators [...] "regarding the alleged reduction in crime if enough people practice TM or the TM-Sidhi program" [...] and they [...] "confirmed that they had suppressed negative evidence". The EEG research referred to by Roark, which required researchers to make EEG measurements during the TM-Sidhi program, was subsequently published in two separate studies in the International Journal of Neuroscience. The editor-in-chief, Sydney Weinstein, said that the studies published in his journal are reviewed by [...] "a distinguished group of scientists from leading universities," [...] and added, [...] "Not once have these scientists ever questioned the integrity or scientific validity of the papers on Transcendental Meditation." ...|$|E
