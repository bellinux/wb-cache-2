5|$|A {{dedicated}} two-way {{bicycle path}} <b>exists</b> <b>on</b> the northern {{side of the}} roadway between Santo Road and Mast Boulevard, with access possible from both terminii. East of the Mast Boulevard interchange, SR52 crosses and begins to parallel the San Diego River. The freeway enters the city of Santee, where SR52 was built alongside Mission Gorge Road. SR52 intersects {{the northern end of}} SR125, where SR52 traffic can exit south onto SR125. The freeway continues east through Santee, with interchanges at Fanita Drive, Cuyamaca Street, and Magnolia Avenue, before it comes to an end at SR67.|$|E

5|$|Although Fuegians from Patagonia {{may have}} visited the Falkland Islands in prehistoric times, the islands were {{uninhabited}} {{at the time}} of their discovery by Europeans. Claims of discovery date back to the 16th century, but no consensus <b>exists</b> <b>on</b> whether early explorers discovered the Falklands or other islands in the South Atlantic. The first recorded landing on the islands is attributed to English captain John Strong, who, en route to Peru's and Chile's littoral in 1690, discovered the Falkland Sound and noted the islands' water and game.|$|E

5|$|Although {{many species}} of Psittacosaurus have been named, their {{relationships}} to each other {{have not yet been}} fully explored and no scientific consensus <b>exists</b> <b>on</b> the subject. Several phylogenetic analyses have been published, with the most detailed being those by Alexander Averianov and colleagues in 2006, Hai-Lu You and colleagues in 2008, and Paul Sereno in 2010. The middle one is shown below.|$|E
5|$|It {{took the}} school {{over five years}} to fully recover {{from the effects of}} the war. Many Old Citizens had lost their lives {{fighting}} in the war. Today, a memorial <b>exists</b> <b>on</b> the school's current grounds to remember those Old Citizens who had lost their lives in both World Wars. An annual remembrance service, involving members of the Combined Cadet Force, is held in November.|$|E
5|$|M. rugustus, M. yaotunensis, and M. lashuyuanensis are {{all known}} from the Nanxiong Basin in Guangdong. This {{formation}} was deposited primary from streams, rivers, and lakes in that region. It spans across the K/T boundary, at which point most of the dinosaur eggs disappear, but Macroolithus apparently <b>exists</b> <b>on</b> {{both sides of the}} boundary (which would imply that some species of dinosaurs survived into the early Tertiary). However, sedimentological evidence suggests that these fossils were actually reworked by debris flows into the Tertiary rocks.|$|E

5|$|Not {{only does}} SCI present {{children}} and adolescents {{with many of the}} same difficulties adults face, it affects the development of their sexuality. Although substantial research <b>exists</b> <b>on</b> SCI and sexuality in adults, very little <b>exists</b> <b>on</b> the ways in which it affects development of sexuality in young people. Injured {{children and adolescents}} need ongoing, age-appropriate sex education that addresses questions of SCI as it relates to sexuality and sexual function. Very young children become aware of their disabilities before their sexuality, but as they age they become curious just as able-bodied children do, and it is appropriate to provide them with increasing amounts of information. Caregivers help the child and family prepare for transition into adulthood, including in sexuality and social interaction, beginning early and intensifying during adolescence. Parents need education about the effects of SCI on sexual function so that they can answer their children's questions.|$|E
5|$|On July 14, 1861, Company E of the 21st New York Volunteer Infantry was {{assigned}} to garrison Fort Jackson. On August 31, the 21st New York was ordered to Fort Cass, Virginia, and was later involved in the Second Battle of Bull Run. No information <b>exists</b> <b>on</b> the unit that replaced it in garrisoning Fort Jackson.|$|E
5|$|Recent evidence,shows that bloomeries {{were used}} in China, {{migrating}} in from the west as early as 800 BC, before being supplanted by the locally developed blast furnace. Supporting this theory was the discovery of 'more than ten' iron digging implements found in the tomb of Duke Jing of Qin (d. 537 BCE), whose tomb is located in Fengxiang County, Shaanxi (a museum <b>exists</b> <b>on</b> the site today).|$|E

5|$|Regarding the {{relations}} of early Philippine polities with the various state-level polities of Indonesia and Malaysia, legendary accounts often mention the interaction of early Philippine polities with the Srivijaya empire, {{but there is not}} much archeological evidence to definitively support such a relationship.

5|$|The {{architecture}} of the original building is attributed to Nicholas Hawksmoor, with some alterations from around 1900 and the subsequent modern 1960s extensions. The original mansion is in the Queen Anne style. The house itself has three storeys constructed of red brick. The ground floor level has a rubbed brick band at nine courses, and another rubbed brick band <b>exists</b> <b>on</b> the second floor, along with a moulded stone cornice level with the sills.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of the neptunium that currently <b>exists</b> <b>on</b> Earth was produced in artificial nuclear reactions. Neptunium-237 is the most commonly synthesized isotope due to it being the only one that both can be created via neutron capture and also has a half-lifelong enough to allow weighable quantities to be easily isolated. As such, it {{is by far the most}} common isotope to be utilized in chemical studies of the element.|$|E

5|$|Titanium is {{non-toxic}} even {{in large}} doses {{and does not}} play any natural role inside the human body. Zirconium powder can cause irritation, but only contact with the eyes requires medical attention. OSHA recommendations for zirconium are 5mg/m3 time weighted average limit and a 10mg/m3 short-term exposure limit. Only limited data <b>exists</b> <b>on</b> the toxicology of hafnium.|$|E
5|$|Waste {{management}} is co-ordinated {{by the local}} authority via the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority. Milnrow's Distribution Network Operator for electricity is United Utilities; there are no power stations in the area, but a Wind farm <b>exists</b> <b>on</b> Scout Moor which consists of 26 turbines on the high moors between Rawtenstall and Rochdale, generating 65MW of electricity. United Utilities also manages Milnrow's drinking and waste water; water supplies are sourced from several local reservoirs, including Kitcliffe, Piethorne and Rooden in Milnrow's outlying moorland between Newhey and Denshaw.|$|E
