5|$|The ACLU lost an {{important}} press censorship case when, in 1957, the Supreme Court upheld the obscenity conviction of publisher Samuel Roth for distributing adult magazines. As late as 1953, {{books such as}} Tropic of Cancer and From Here to Eternity were still banned. But public standards rapidly became more liberal though the 1960s, and obscenity was notoriously <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>define,</b> so by 1971 prosecutions for obscenity had halted.|$|E
5|$|The urban {{expansion}} of Gateshead makes exact overall boundaries <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>define.</b> Although administratively considered one area, official documentation has split Felling into three distinct neighbourhoods: North, Central and High Felling. Felling North is roughly {{comparable to the}} old settlement at Felling Shore, bounded to the north by the River Tyne and the south by Sunderland Road. The other neighbourhoods also broadly follow their historical boundaries; the central area includes Felling town centre and the surrounding streets, while High Felling incorporates Coldwell Lane and the adjoining streets moving south towards Windy Nook.|$|E

5|$|As John Wilson {{and others}} have noted, it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>define</b> leisure. Its {{definitions}} are numerous and often mutually contradictory, for example as a discrete portion of one's time or as a quality of experience irrespective of time. Joffre Dumazedier distinguished four distinct definitions of leisure, which begin broadly and gradually narrow in scope. The first and broadest defines leisure as a style of behavior that may occur even at work, the second defines it as any non-work activity; the third further excludes family and household obligations; and, finally, the narrowest defines leisure as activities dedicated to self-fulfillment. Dumazedier's four definitions are not exhaustive. Incompatible definitions and measures {{are seen as a}} major factor accounting for occasionally contradictory research findings.|$|E
5|$|In fact, process {{theology}} is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>define</b> because process theologians are so diverse and transdisciplinary in their views and interests. John B. Cobb, Jr. {{is a process}} theologian who has also written books on biology and economics. Roland Faber and Catherine Keller integrate Whitehead with poststructuralist, postcolonialist, and feminist theory. Charles Birch was both a theologian and a geneticist. Franklin I. Gamwell writes on theology and political theory. In Syntheism - Creating God in The Internet Age, futurologists Alexander Bard and Jan Söderqvist repeatedly credit Whitehead for the process theology they see {{rising out of the}} participatory culture expected to dominate the digital era.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 7th century, the West Saxons {{occupied}} {{an area in}} the west of southern England, though the exact boundaries are <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>define.</b> To their west was the native British kingdom of Dumnonia, {{in what is now}} Devon and Cornwall. To the north were the Mercians, whose king, Wulfhere, had dominated southern England during his reign. In 674 he was succeeded by his brother, Æthelred, who was less militarily active than Wulfhere had been along the frontier with Wessex, though the West Saxons did not recover the territorial gains Wulfhere had made. To the southeast was the kingdom of the South Saxons, in what is now Sussex; and to the east were the East Saxons, who controlled London.|$|E

5|$|The nuthatches {{are all in}} {{the genus}} Sitta Linnaeus, 1758, a name derived from , Ancient Greek for this bird. Nuthatch refers to the {{propensity}} of some species to wedge a large insect or seed in a crack and hack at it with their strong bills. Species boundaries in the nuthatches are <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>define.</b> The red-breasted nuthatch, Corsican nuthatch and Chinese nuthatch have breeding ranges separated by thousands of kilometres, but are similar in habitat preference, appearance and song. They were formerly considered to be one species, but are now normally split into three and comprise a superspecies along with the Krüper's and Algerian nuthatch. Unusually for nuthatches, all five species excavate their own nests.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of the}} Universe is {{somewhat}} <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>define.</b> According to a restrictive definition, the Universe is everything within our connected spacetime that could {{have a chance to}} interact with us and vice versa. According to the general theory of relativity, some regions of space may never interact with ours even in the lifetime of the Universe due to the finite speed of light and the ongoing expansion of space. For example, radio messages sent from Earth may never reach some regions of space, even if the Universe were to exist forever: space may expand faster than light can traverse it.|$|E
5|$|A precise search {{area was}} <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>define,</b> as even small {{differences}} in {{estimates of the}} aircraft's speed, or the environmental conditions along the flight path (which varied significantly by location and altitude), changed Cooper's projected landing point considerably. An important variable was {{the length of time}} he remained in free fall before pulling his rip cord—if indeed he succeeded in opening a parachute at all. Neither of the Air Force fighter pilots saw anything exit the airliner, either visually or on radar, nor did they see a parachute open; but at night, with extremely limited visibility and cloud cover obscuring any ground lighting below, an airborne human figure clad entirely in black clothing could easily have gone undetected. The T-33 pilots never made visual contact with the 727 at all.|$|E

5|$|In {{the urban}} {{expansion}} of Gateshead, Deckham was enveloped {{so that its}} exact boundaries are <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>define.</b> The estate had boundaries at Split Crow Road, Old Durham Road, Hendon Road and Carr Hill Road but documents indicate that Deckham stretches to Durham Road {{in the west and}} the streets adjoining Hendon Road as far north as the Bankies open space at Mount Pleasant. In1974 Deckham was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead by the Local Government Act 1972. Until its implementation, Deckham was part of County Durham. It is now bordered by settlements which are part of the metropolitan borough. These are Sheriff Hill to the south, Low Fell and Shipcote to the west, Gateshead to the north and Felling and Carr Hill to the east.|$|E

25|$|The Augustan era is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>define</b> {{chronologically}} in {{prose and}} poetry, {{but it is}} very easy to date its end in drama. The Augustan era's drama ended definitively in 1737, with the Licensing Act.

25|$|The {{information}} from Pythagoras (6th century BC) is more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>define.</b> The Comedic authors such as Aristophanes and Alexis described Pythagoreans as strictly vegetarian, {{with some of}} them living on bread and water alone.

25|$|Though it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>define</b> {{what can}} {{properly}} {{be called a}} 'Cubist sculpture', Picasso's 1909-10 Head bares the hallmarks of early Cubism in that the various surfaces constituting the face and hair are broken down into irregular fragments that meet at sharp angles, rendering practically unreadable the basic volume of the head beneath. These facets are obviously a translation from two to three dimensions of the broken planes of Picasso's 1909-10 paintings.|$|E

25|$|Indianapolis' {{neighborhoods are}} often <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>define</b> {{because the city}} lacks {{historical}} ethnic divisions, as in Chicago, or physical boundaries, seen in Pittsburgh and Cincinnati. Instead, most neighborhoods are subtle in their distinctions.

Expansion of the interurban system {{at the turn of}} the 20th century facilitated growth of several streetcar suburbs, including Broad Ripple, Irvington, University Heights, and Woodruff Place.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the concept}} of circles and spheres can be {{extended}} to hyperbolic space, finding the densest packing becomes much more difficult.

The concept of average density also becomes much more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>define</b> accurately. The densest packings in any hyperbolic space are almost always irregular.|$|E
