25|$|The Hongwu Emperor of the Ming dynasty {{emulated}} the Yuan dynasty {{rules on}} the use of the dragon motif and decreed that the dragon would be his emblem and that it would have five claws. The four-clawed dragon would become typically for imperial nobility and certain high-ranking officials. The three clawed dragon was used by lower ranks and the general public (widely seen on various Chinese goods in the Ming dynasty). The dragon, however, was only for select royalty closely associated with the imperial family, usually in various symbolic colors, while it was a capital offense for anyone—other than the emperor himself—to <b>ever</b> <b>use</b> the completely gold-colored, five-clawed Long dragon motif. Improper use of claw number or colors was considered treason, punishable by execution of the offender's entire clan. The convention was carried into the Qing dynasty, and portraits of the Qing emperors were usually depicted with five-clawed dragons.|$|E
25|$|In Redemption Ark, Skade and Clavain {{independently}} encounter technology {{captured by}} the Mademoiselle, that permits the alteration of a ship's inertial mass in order to permit high-g acceleration for interstellar travel. It works by suppressing fluctuations and turmoil in quantum foam that supposedly causes momentum and inertia (similar {{to the concept of}} Higgs Bosons). It is also mentioned in that the technology may have been linked to the alien tower (in Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days). Skade tries to modify the technology with the help of Exordium to allow faster than light travel, via a state transition from tardyonic to tachyonic, but her efforts are spectacularly unsuccessful, and the technology itself has the side effect of removing individuals caught in the transition bubbles from all recent history, as well as crippling her ship. Only those very close to the area of effect remember a person who is erased or unravelled backwards in time and recorded history indicates a much earlier death of that person. Because the victims (the deleted and nearby observers) are the only thing that remain from the time line where the victims began, people suddenly panicking and searching for a 'colleague' who died years before (in the new timeframe) can be the only sign of an accident. This happens at least twice in the novels. The Inhibitors make reference to a similar effect erasing entire species from history. As such, neither they nor any other species in the galaxy with the technology to build inertia suppressing drives <b>ever</b> <b>use</b> them to travel faster than light.|$|E
25|$|Launched on 14 September 1969 with 60 tanks, 26 PAVN and 10 Pathet Lao battalions, plus {{supporting}} units, Campaign 139 {{drove from}} the Lao/DRV border into the strategic Plain of Jars in Military Region 2 of the Kingdom of Laos. The 16,000 plus invaders were opposed by {{a force of}} Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) sponsored hill tribes guerrillas some 5,500 to 6,000 strong. Hmong general Vang Pao's L'Armee Clandestine had just overrun the Plain during Kou Kiet, and the general elected to hold on. However, despite {{the best efforts of}} the guerrillas in a series of defensive clashes on and around the Plain, backed by massive air power, on 11 February 1970 the communists forced entrance to the Plain by capturing the crucial intersection of Routes 7/74. Having forced their way onto the Plain, the communists pushed their way across it to besiege the crucial main guerrilla base at Long Tieng. They overran the nearby refugee center at Sam Thong on 18 March 1970, and temporarily occupied the high ground overlooking the Lima Site 20A airstrip at Long Tieng used for resupplying the guerrillas. United States support of the irregulars was escalated, with the first B-52 Stratofortress Arc Light in northern Laos on 17 February, and the first <b>ever</b> <b>use</b> of the BLU-82 super-bomb on 22 March. On 18 March, irregular reinforcements were flown in from other military regions of Laos; so was a Royal Thai artillery battalion of mercenaries. Though the newly arrived guerrilla units were generally poor quality, they sufficed to fend off the exhausted PAVN. By 25 April 1970, the communists had fallen back onto their home ground near Dien Bien Phu, North Vietnam.|$|E

40|$|Among {{women of}} {{reproductive}} {{age in the}} United States, at least 15 percent will report <b>ever</b> <b>using</b> infertility services. Using data from the 2006 – 2010 National Survey of Family Growth, this study considers the relationship between use of infertility services and a woman’s self-rated health. This study employs a logistic regression to predict the probability of reporting {{a certain level of}} self-rated health or lower when a woman reports seeking medical assistance for infertility. An additional measure considers the interaction between a woman <b>ever</b> <b>using</b> infertility services and the attitude toward having children on the probability of a lower level of self-rated health. Results indicate that <b>ever</b> <b>using</b> infertility services does increase the risk of women reporting worse self-rated health outcomes compared to women who have never used infertility services. The analysis of the interaction between the attitudes toward having children and <b>ever</b> <b>using</b> infertility services suggest that women who believe the reward of having children is worth the cost and who have <b>ever</b> <b>used</b> infertility services {{are also more likely to}} report worse self-rated health outcomes compared to women who have not used infertility services. This study provides further insight into the unique relationship between the infertility experience and overall health outcomes for women...|$|R

It has unique exterior design cues which makes it different from other Zondas produced with the most distinguishable features being the barchetta body style and rear wheel covers inspired by group C race cars, making it the first Pagani to <b>ever</b> <b>use</b> this styling. It also has a rear spoiler, air intakes and rear lights taken from the 760 series cars. Power comes courtesy of the [...] Mercedes-Benz V12 engine engine producing [...] and [...] of torque making it the most powerful road legal Zonda ever produced. It borrows its seats and suspension from the Huayra BC along with its power output being identical to the BC with the only difference being that the BC has a Bi-turbo engine while the HP Barchetta is naturally aspirated. The wheels of the car also have different colour inlays with the wheels at the left having gold and the wheels at the right having blue inlays. Production is limited to just 3 units. The Zonda HP Barchetta marks an end to the Zonda's production run. The 760 series cars and other special edition Zondas can still be commissioned upon customer request.|$|E
