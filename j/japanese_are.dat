5|$|Even {{though most}} {{consumer}} items {{are in short}} supply in North Korea, there is a considerable variety of cigarettes available. In general, strong tobacco is preferred, and filters are rare. Western brands, particularly American, but also Chinese, Russian and <b>Japanese</b> <b>are</b> popular with the elite and preferred over domestic cigarettes. Foreign cigarettes and the domestic 727 brand, whose name stands for 27 July, the date of the Korean Armistice Agreement, are veritable status symbols. Menthol cigarettes are virtually non-existent, but there is competition among tobacco companies to introduce other attractive products, such as fruit-flavoured balls inside the filter to give the cigarette flavour.|$|E
5|$|The {{changes in}} {{demographic}} structure {{have created a}} number of social issues, particularly a potential decline in workforce population and increase {{in the cost of}} social security benefits like the public pension plan. A growing number of younger <b>Japanese</b> <b>are</b> not marrying or remain childless. In 2011, Japan's population dropped for a fifth year, falling by 204,000 people to 126.24 million people. This was the greatest decline since at least 1947, when comparable figures were first compiled. This decline was made worse by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, which killed nearly 16,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Casualties {{during the}} {{fighting}} around Isurava have been variously reported. In the immediate post war era, Australian sources tended {{to report a}} ratio of around five Japanese killed for every one Australian, with the Australians estimating that they had killed around 700 Japanese; however, in recent times this has been revised. The Japanese also initially over-estimated the casualties they inflicted on the Australians, claiming 1,000 killed, before reducing this to 300. It is now thought that the casualties were more even, although still favouring the Australians. For the Australians, casualties are now reported as 99 killed and 111 wounded while the <b>Japanese</b> <b>are</b> thought to have lost 140 killed and 231 wounded.|$|E

25|$|Most of the Japanese {{officers}} who stayed served as military instructors for the Viet Minh forces, most notably at the Quang Ngai Army Academy. There were necessary conventional military knowledge {{such as how}} to conduct assaults, night attacks, company/battalion level exercises, commanding, tactics, navigation, communications and movements. A few, however, actively led Vietnamese forces into combat. The French also identified eleven Japanese nurses and two doctors working for the Viet Minh in northern Vietnam in 1951.

In parts of the Koshikijima Islands, the latter may be pronounced as -gan or -ran. In other parts, namely the Southern Satsuma Peninsula, these forms are replaced by compounding the determiner suffix -n with the noun yu followed by the directional suffix -n if used before a verb, thus creating the forms konyu(n), sonyu(n), anyu(n) and donyu(n). The preceding compound is equivalent {{to that of the}} standard form -noyou(ni), as in konoyou(ni), sonoyou(ni), etc.|$|E

About 27,000 people joined the uprising, but it was crushed by the shogunate after a sustained campaign. They are not considered martyrs by the Catholic Church since they took up arms for materialistic reasons. Many <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> deported to Macau or to the Spanish Philippines.

25|$|The Unicode hiragana block {{contains}} precomposed characters for all hiragana in {{the modern}} set, including small vowels and yōon kana for compound syllables, plus the archaic ゐ wi and ゑ we and the rare ゔ vu; the archaic 𛀁 ye is included in plane 1 at U+1B001 (see below). All combinations of hiragana with dakuten and handakuten used in modern <b>Japanese</b> <b>are</b> available as precomposed characters, and can also be produced by using a base hiragana followed by the combining dakuten and handakuten characters (U+3099 and U+309A, respectively). This method is used to add the diacritics to kana that are not normally used with them, for example applying the dakuten to a pure vowel or the handakuten to a kana not in the h-group.|$|E
25|$|As both Korea and Taiwan {{had been}} under the {{domination}} of Japan for an indefinite amount of time, many citizens of both territories were forced to work under the Japanese military and experienced violence for a long time.

In addition to their lack of knowledge and training for the treatment of POWs, many of them are involved in brutalising the POWs where the treatment of POWs are much worsened after the replacement of Japanese guards in Elopura by the Taiwanese in April 1943.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese {{had major}} {{prisoner}} of war (POW) camps at Kuching, Ranau, and Sandakan, plus smaller ones at Dahan and other locations.

Sandakan camp was also closed by the Japanese prior to the Allied invasion; with most of its occupants {{died as a result of}} forced marches from Sandakan to Ranau. In total, the <b>Japanese</b> <b>are</b> believed to have held an estimated 4,660 prisoners and internees at all camps in northern Borneo, with only 1,387 managed to survived in Batu Lintang camp and only six in the forced marches until the end of the war.|$|E

As a result of the action, the US forces established themselves in a position to further harass the Japanese forces that were withdrawing east to Cape Hoskins. The commander of the 5th Marines, Smith, also recommended that a forward naval base be established at Talasea for PT boats to operate from in order to interdict the barges that the Japanese were sending between Cape Hoskins and Rabaul.|$|E
