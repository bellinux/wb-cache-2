2500|$|After the war, {{inflation}} {{began to}} devalue the Krone, {{which was still}} Austria's currency. In autumn 1922, Austria was granted an <b>international</b> <b>loan</b> supervised by the League of Nations. The purpose of the loan was to avert bankruptcy, stabilise the currency, and improve Austria's general economic condition. The loan meant that Austria passed from an independent state to the control exercised by the League of Nations. In 1925, the Schilling [...] was introduced, replacing the Krone {{at a rate of}} 10,000:1. Later, it was nicknamed the [...] "Alpine dollar" [...] due to its stability. From 1925 to 1929, the economy enjoyed a short high before nearly crashing after Black Tuesday.|$|E
2500|$|On January 24, 1992, J. Carter Brown {{announced}} that he was retiring as director of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. After a nationwide search, Earl A. Powell III was named director of the National Gallery of Art. He was only the fourth director in the museum's history. He assumed the directorship on September 1, 1992. When he was appointed, Powell said that he believed the era of [...] "blockbuster" [...] exhibitions was ending, and that his focus would be to utilize the NGA's permanent collection. [...] "I don't see the future for these massive <b>international</b> <b>loan</b> exhibitions," [...] he said. [...] "I would prefer to use the gallery's permanent collections in new and innovative ways." ...|$|E

In 1921, U.S. museums began to acquire his work and did so {{increasingly}} thereafter. His first solo museum show in the US was at the Detroit Institute of Arts in 1937. In 1969, a major retrospective of paintings, drawings,and prints traveled to the Seattle Art Museum, the Pasadena Art Museum, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. In 1992, the National Gallery of Art, [...] Washington, held a monographic show, using its existing collection; a major <b>international</b> <b>loan</b> exhibition took place in 2003. In November 2006 at Christie's, Kirchner's Street Scene, Berlin (1913) fetched $38 million, a record for the artist. From 3 August to 10 November 2008, the Museum of Modern Art in New York held a major exhibition that [...] "probably comprises the very best of his oeuvre." ...|$|E

2500|$|The BIS was {{originally}} intended to facilitate reparations imposed on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles after World War I, and to act as the trustee for the German Government <b>International</b> <b>Loan</b> (Young Loan) that was floated in 1930. The need to establish a dedicated institution for this purpose was suggested in 1929 by the Young Committee, and was agreed to in August of that year at a conference at The Hague. [...] A charter for the bank was drafted at the International Bankers Conference at Baden-Baden in November, and its charter was adopted at a second Hague Conference on January 20, 1930. According to the charter, shares in the bank could be held by individuals and non-governmental entities. [...] However, the rights of voting and representation at the Bank’s General Meeting were to be exercised exclusively by the central banks {{of the countries in}} which the shares had been initially subscribed. The BIS was constituted as having corporate existence in Switzerland on the basis of an agreement with Switzerland acting as headquarters state for the bank. It also enjoyed certain immunities in the contracting states (Brussels Protocol 1936).|$|E
60|$|I pass to {{a second}} {{financial}} proposal. The requirements of Europe are immediate. The prospect of being relieved of oppressive interest payments to England and America over the whole life {{of the next two}} generations (and of receiving from Germany some assistance year by year to the costs of restoration) would free the future from excessive anxiety. But it would not meet the ills of the immediate present,--the excess of Europe's imports over her exports, the adverse exchange, and the disorder of the currency. It will be very difficult for European production to get started again without a temporary measure of external assistance. I am therefore a supporter of an <b>international</b> <b>loan</b> in some shape or form, such as has been advocated in many quarters in France, Germany, and England, and also in the United States. In whatever way the ultimate responsibility for repayment is distributed, the burden of finding the immediate resources must inevitably fall in major part upon the United States.|$|E
60|$|I do not {{propose to}} enter on details. But the main {{outlines}} of all schemes for an <b>international</b> <b>loan</b> are much the same, The countries {{in a position}} to lend assistance, the neutrals, the United Kingdom, and, for the greater portion of the sum required, the United States, must provide foreign purchasing credits for all the belligerent countries of continental Europe, allied and ex-enemy alike. The aggregate sum required might not be so large as is sometimes supposed. Much might be done, perhaps, with a fund of $1,000,000,000 in the first instance. This sum, even if a precedent of a different kind had been established by the cancellation of Inter-Ally War Debt, should be lent and should be borrowed with the unequivocal intention of its being repaid in full. With this object in view, the security for the loan should be the best obtainable, and the arrangements for its ultimate repayment as complete as possible. In particular, it should rank, both for payment of interest and discharge of capital, in front of all Reparation claims, all Inter-Ally War Debt, all internal war loans, and all other Government indebtedness of any other kind. Those borrowing countries who will be entitled to Reparation payments should be required to pledge all such receipts to repayment of the new loan. And all the borrowing countries should be required to place their customs duties on a gold basis and to pledge such receipts to its service.|$|E

2500|$|The {{susceptibility}} of Shevardnadze's {{government and}} his plummeting popularity between 2000-2003 can partially {{be traced to}} economic problems and mismanagement. Beginning in 1998, actual national budget revenues began to fall far short of projections. In 1999, the Georgian state collected only 70% of its projected revenue, a state of affairs that would continue through 2003. To address this problem, the government began to use deceptive accounting techniques to mask budget deficiencies. [...] Shevardnadze's government found itself both starved of funds and unable to meet IMF standards for <b>international</b> <b>loans.</b> The IMF finally suspended its own funding for Georgia in 2002. Without access to <b>international</b> <b>loans,</b> Georgia {{would not be able}} to restructure or repay its significant debts.|$|R

50|$|The {{economic}} crisis in Colombia {{during the period of}} 1928 through 1933 was a devastating result of the previous years of prosperity based on high amounts of <b>international</b> <b>loans</b> and credits, high prices in the exporting coffee and a confident country that generated investment and cash flow. The same way that Colombia prospered thanks to the U.S.A., it went down parallel to it in their time of crisis. The New York stock market collapsed and the confidence within the country was low and protective, the investment stopped, as well as the loans and Colombia was directly affected by that situation. There was a constant decrease in the exporting potential product of Colombia; coffee, as well as a cut in the <b>international</b> <b>loans</b> and investment. Eventually the crisis in the U.S.A. generated within Colombia a cut in urban employment, diminished internal market and among other problematic social and economic situations.|$|R
