To date, comets are only known to be ejected by interacting with another object in the Solar System, such as Jupiter.

25|$|Mars Pathfinder {{directly}} entered Mars {{atmosphere in}} a retrograde direction from a <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>trajectory</b> at 6.1km/s using an atmospheric entry aeroshell (capsule) that {{was derived from}} the original Viking Mars lander design. The aeroshell consisted of a back shell and a specially designed ablative heatshield to slow to 370m/s (830mph) where a supersonic disk-gap-band parachute was inflated to slow its descent through the thin Martian atmosphere to 68m/s (about 160mph). The lander's on-board computer used redundant on-board accelerometers to determine the timing of the parachute inflation. Twenty seconds later the heatshield was pyrotechnically released. Another twenty seconds later the lander was separated and lowered from the backshell on a 20m bridle (tether). When the lander reached 1.6km above the surface, a radar was used by the on-board computer to determine altitude and descent velocity. This information was used by the computer to determine the precise timing of the landing events that followed.|$|E

40|$|Flow visualization; Lagrangian {{coherent}} structures; <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>trajectories</b> Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS), apparent as ridges in the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) field, {{represent a}} time-dependent {{alternative to the}} concept of separatrices in vector field topology. Traditionally, LCS are analyzed and visualized in terms of their geometric shape only, neglecting stretching and compression in tangent directions. These effects are, however, of particular interest in mixing phenomena and turbulence. Hyperbolicity {{plays an important role in}} these processes and gives rise to <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>trajectories</b> originating at the intersections of forward and reverse LCS. Since integration of <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>trajectories</b> is difficult, we propose to visualize the corresponding space-time intersection curves of LCS instead. By stacking the traditional 2 D FTLE video frames of time-dependent vector fields, a space-time FTLE field is obtained. In this field, ridge lines turn into ridge surfaces representing LCS, and their intersection forms curves that are a robust alternative to <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>trajectories.</b> Additionally, we use a space-time representation of the time-dependent vector field, leading to a steady 3 D space-time vector field. In this field, the LCS become stream surfaces given that their advection property is sufficiently met. This makes visualization of the dynamics within LCS amenable to line integral convolution (LIC), conveying in particular the dynamics around <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>trajectories.</b> To avoid occlusion, the LCS can be constrained to space-time bands around the intersection curves, resembling visualization by saddle connectors. We evaluate our approach using synthetic, simulated, and measured vector fields...|$|R
