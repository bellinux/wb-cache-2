40|$|Until {{the late}} 1980 s, {{gastroenterology}} (GE) {{was considered a}} subspecialty of Internal Medicine. Today, GE also incorporates Hepatology. However, Digestive Oncology training is poorly defined in the <b>Hepatogastroenterology</b> (HGE) -curriculum. Therefore, a Digestive Oncology curriculum should be developed and this document might be {{a starting point for}} such a curriculum. HGE-specialists are increasingly resisting the paradigm in which they play only a diagnostic and technical role in the management of digestive tumors. We suggest minimum end-points in the standard HGE-curriculum for oncology, and recommend a focus year in the Netherlands for Digestive Oncology in the HGE-curriculum. To produce well-trained digestive oncologists, an advanced Digestive Oncology training program with specific qualifications in Digestive Oncology (2 years) has been developed. The schedule in Belgium includes a period of at least 6 mo to be spent in a medical oncology department. The goal of these programs remains the production of well-trained digestive oncologists. HGE specialists are part of the multidisciplinary oncological teams, and some have been administering chemotherapy in their countries for years.

It {{can be defined as}} a neuropsychiatric syndrome caused by portosystemic venous shunting, ranging from minimal to overt hepatic encephalopathy or coma. Its pathophysiology is still unclear, although increased levels of ammonia play a key role. Diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy is currently based on specific tests evaluating the neuropsychiatric state of patients and their quality of life; the severity of hepatic encephalopathy is measured by the West Haven criteria. Treatment of hepatic encephalopathy consists of pharmacological and corrective measures, as well as nutritional interventions. Rifaximin received approval for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in 2010 because of its few side effects and pharmacological benefits. The aim of this work is to review the use and efficacy of rifaximin both in acute and long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy. Treatment of overt hepatic encephalopathy involves management of the acute episode as well as maintenance of remission in those patients who have previously experienced an episode, in order to improve their quality of life.

The aim of this multicenter cross-sectional study was to evaluate the prevalence of, and risk factors for, hepatitis C infection in consecutive hospitalized patients with diabetes and to assess the nosocomial risk and magnitude of HCV infection in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive hospitalized patients with diabetes seen in 11 French <b>hepatogastroenterology</b> and diabetology departments were studied. The prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies was compared with that observed in healthy blood donors and individuals seen during routine medical checkup. Diabetic patients with anti-HCV antibodies were compared with patients without anti-HCV antibodies for assessment of risk factors. RESULTS: In total 1561 patients were studied. Independent risk factors for HCV infection were assessed through multivariate analysis. Thirty-three patients (2. 11 %) had anti-HCV antibodies and 21 (63. 70 %) had HCV identified risk factors. The prevalence of HCV infection was higher in patients with diabetes than in blood donors (0. 08 %) or healthy controls (0. 20 %) (P 2) of previous admissions since the onset of diabetes (OR= 2. 52, P= 0. 039).

Sorafenib is approved for Child-Pugh class A patients with unresectable and advanced HCC. We report here a rare {{case of a}} patient with advanced HCC with right portal vein thrombosis (PVT) who achieved a complete response after treatment with sorafenib. This 74 -year-old man {{was a case of}} non-hepatitis B and C virus-related cirrhosis. Multiphase liver computed tomography showed an 8 cm tumor with early enhance, early wash out, and right PVT at segment 8 of the right lobe. A liver tumor biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of poorly differentiated HCC. Blood tests showed Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis and an alpha-fetoprotein level of 33, 058 ng/mL. Sorafenib was initiated at 800 mg/day but was eventually reduced to 400 mg every other day because of a grade 3 hand-foot skin reaction. The alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level decreased rapidly with a linear trend after treatment. After log transformation, the calculated half-life of AFP was 6. 84 days. There was no more tumor arterial enhancement, and tumor size was decreased to 3. 7 cm on day 42. PVT shrank gradually and localized to the right anterior branch at month 9. There was no recurrence of tumor at the end of follow-up in month 19. Typical serial changes of clinical parameters were demonstrated in this patient.

Methods: Eight hundred and sixty-six patients on maintenance HD were recruited. Clinical parameters were recorded and subjected {{to the analysis of}} predictors of predialysis hypotension and mortality. Results: Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated that DM (odds ratio [OR]: 0. 439, P= 0. 002), hypertension history (OR: 0. 634, P= 0. 022), Kt/V Daugirdas (OR: 2. 545, P= 0. 001), anuria (OR: 2. 313, P= 0. 002), serum phosphate (OR: 0. 833, P= 0. 010), and serum triglyceride (OR: 1. 002, P= 0. 012) were associated with predialysis hypotension. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that age (P< 0. 001), male sex (P= 0. 029), anuria (P= 0. 004), and DM (P= 0. 011) were associated with higher probability of 24 - and 36 -month mortality.

In a developing country, these advanced gadgets may not be always available. We performed LS using conventional and reusable instruments in a public teaching the hospital {{without the use of}} the advanced technology. The technique of LS and the outcome in these patients is reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS : Patients undergoing LS for various hematological disorders from 1998 to 2004 were included. Electrocoagulation, clips, and intracorporeal knotting were the techniques used for tackling short-gastric vessels and splenic pedicle. Specimen was delivered through a Pfannensteil incision. RESULTS : A total of 26 patients underwent LS. Twenty-two (85 &#x 0025;) of patients had spleen size more than 500 g (average weight being 942. 55 g). Mean operative time was 214 min (45 - 390 min). The conversion rate was 11. 5 &#x 0025; (n = 3). Average duration of stay was 5. 65 days (3 - 30 days). Accessory spleen was detected and successfully removed in two patients. One patient developed subphrenic abscess. There was no mortality. There was no recurrence of hematological disease. CONCLUSION : Laparoscopic splenectomy using conventional equipment and instruments is safe and effective.

Air pollution has been confirmed as being associated with increased incidence of human morbidity and mortality. To our knowledge, investigating air pollution as a dialysis-unrelated factor for SHPT in patients undergoing dialysis is limited. We developed this study to assess the effect of air pollution and other important risk factors on SHPT in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). Materials and methods: We recruited a total of 141 patients {{who did not have}} diabetes mellitus, were nonsmokers, and were undergoing PD in this cross-sectional study. We analyzed the difference in air quality based on the patients’ living areas. We estimated demographic, hematological, nutritional, inflammatory, biochemical, air pollutant, and dialysis-related data based on this cross-sectional study. Subgroup analysis of the relationship between air pollutants and the clinical variables and having or not having hyperparathyroidism (HPT) (intact parathyroid hormone level ≥ 180 pg/dL) was also performed. Results: A total of 141 patients undergoing PD (30 men and 111 women) were enrolled in the study. Sixty-eight patients had SHPT. In a binary logistic regression, high environmental CO exposure (odds ratio [OR] 3. 22, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 42 – 7. 28; P= 0. 005), serum phosphate levels (OR 1. 66, 95 % CI 1. 17 – 2. 37; P= 0. 005), hypoalbuminemia (OR 3. 76, 95 % CI 1. 29 – 10. 94; P= 0. 015), and use of calcitriol (OR 8. 25, 95 % CI 3. 43 – 19. 85; P< 0. 001) were positively associated with SHPT. Conclusion: The findings of this cross-sectional study indicated the presence of an association between environmental CO exposure and SHPT in patients undergoing PD who did not have diabetes mellitus. Therefore, poor environmental air quality may be a risk factor for deterioration of SHPT in patients undergoing PD.

HCV should be treated in hemodialyzed patients before their enlistment for kidney transplantation {{in order to avoid the}} reactivation of virus after transplantation. Direct-acting antivirals represent the current standard of care in hemodialyzed patients with HCV genotypes 1 and 4; in patients with genotypes 2 or 3, the optimal regimen is yet to be established. Sofosbuvir (SOF) and daclatasvir (DCV) represent an antiviral pangenotypic regimen with favorable pharmacokinetics in hemodialyzed patients. We retrospectively evaluated safety and efficacy of the combination of SOF and DCV in the treatment of genotype 3 a chronic HCV in six male patients (mean age of 39 years, range 25 – 53 years) with end-stage renal disease on maintenance hemodialysis; these patients were treated with a reduced dose of SOF (one half of a 400 mg tablet) and 60 mg of DCV once daily. The anticipated treatment duration was 12 weeks. Initial HCV RNA ranged from 120, 000 to 11, 000, 000 IU/mL. Two of the six patients had compensated liver cirrhosis based on shear-wave elastography result. All of the patients completed a 12 -week treatment. Viremia became negative on treatment and remained negative 12 weeks after the end of therapy in all the patients. All of them (6 / 6, 100 %) achieved sustained virological response, including two with cirrhosis and two with HCV RNA > 6, 000, 000 IU/mL. The treatment was well tolerated: none of the patients presented with a serious adverse event requiring hospital admission and none had anemia or any significant changes in blood count. One patient had a short period of diarrhea, which was resolved with antibiotic treatment. The combination of reduced-dose SOF and full-dose DCV, daily, was a safe and effective treatment in our group of hemodialyzed patients infected with HCV genotype 3.

Therefore, only patients with a high chance of cure should be treated with interferon-based treatment. Patients and methods: Expression of IFNG, IFNLR 1, and interferon-sensitive genes CXCL 9, IFI 16, IFI 27, ISG 15, and USP 18 in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} was assessed before and during the initial 12 weeks of treatment. The studied group consisted of 26 treatment-experienced patients of average age of 50 years {{with advanced}} liver fibrosis compared to seven healthy volunteers. Fourteen patients were treated with pegylated interferon alpha 2 b, ribavirin, and boceprevir and 12 patients with telaprevir. The overall sustained virological response (SVR) rate was 69 % (18 / 26). Results: A significant difference in the initial expression (median, interquartile range [IQR]) of CXCL 9 2. 9 ×, IQR: 1. 7 – 12. 4 vs 1. 2 ×, IQR: 0. 5 – 1. 8; (P= 0. 01) IFNG 7. 3 ×, IQR: 1. 7 – 32. 6 vs 0. 7 ×, IQR: 0. 4 – 1. 3; P= 0. 002 and USP 18 3. 7 ×, IQR: 2. 1 – 7. 7 vs 1. 4 ×, IQR: 0. 9 – 1. 6; (P= 0. 03) was found between the SVR and non-SVR groups. Expression of all analyzed genes was progressively increasing during the first 12 weeks of therapy, but a significant difference between SVR and non-SVR group was found only in USP 18 expression at week 12 (P= 0. 001). Initial expression of four genes predicted SVR in univariate analysis (CXCL 9 [OR: 12. 00, 95 % CI:  1. 21 – 118. 89], IFI 27 [OR: 12. 00, 95 % CI: 1. 21 – 118. 89], IFNG [OR: 10. 50, 95 % CI: 1. 50 – 73. 67], USP 18 [OR: 21. 00, 95 % CI: 2. 05 – 215. 18]). In multivariate analysis, only the initial expression of USP 18 was identified as a predictor of SVR (P= 0. 047). Conclusion: Initial expression of USP 18 and the course of its activation could be a reliable predictor of SVR achievement.
