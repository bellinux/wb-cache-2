40|$|We {{describe}} a system demonstrator based on vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers, metal–semiconductor–metal detectors, {{printed circuit board}} (PCB) level optoelectronic device packaging, a compact bulk optical relay, and novel barrel/PCB optomechanics. The entire system was constructed in a standard VME <b>electrical</b> backplane <b>chassis</b> and was capable of operating at 3 ̆e 1. 7 Gbit/s of aggregate data capacity. In addition to the component technologies developed, we describe operational testing and characterization of the demonstrator...|$|R
5000|$|After {{purchasing}} the car, Jay Leno made numerous enhancements to the roadworthiness of the vehicle, including new six-speed Allison automatic gearbox, new rear brakes, new <b>electrical</b> system, and <b>chassis</b> work. [...] The engine was later upgraded with fuel injection and twin turbochargers from Gale Banks and his company, Gale Banks Engineering, estimated to produce [...] and [...] of torque.|$|R
50|$|The 918 Spyder offers five {{different}} running modes: E-Drive allows {{the car to}} run under battery power alone, using the rear electric motor and front motor, giving a range of 18 mi for the concept model. The official U.S. EPA all-electric range is 12 mi. The total range with a full tank of gasoline and a fully charged battery is 420 mi according to EPA tests. Under the E-Drive mode the car can reach 93 mph. Two hybrid modes (Hybrid, and Race) use both the engine and electric motors to provide the desired levels of economy and performance. In Race mode a push-to-pass button initiates the Hot Lap setting, which delivers additional <b>electrical</b> power.The <b>chassis</b> is a carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic monocoque. The 918 has electromechanical brakes.|$|R
25|$|In February 2002, Ford ended car {{production}} in the UK. It {{was the first time}} in 90 years that Ford cars had not been made in Britain, although production of the Transit van continued at the company's Southampton facility until mid-2013, engines at Bridgend and Dagenham, and transmissions at Halewood. Development of European Ford is broadly split between Dunton in Essex (powertrain, Fiesta/Ka, and commercial vehicles) and Cologne (body, <b>chassis,</b> <b>electrical,</b> Focus, Mondeo) in Germany. Ford also produced the Thames range of commercial vehicles, although the use of this brand name was discontinued circa 1965.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{acrylonitrile}} butadiene styrene “ABS” resin is used {{in a variety of}} exterior and <b>chassis</b> <b>electrical</b> products, it have been contained brominated flame retardants to prevent fire accidients. If the resin (ABS) was thermally decomposed, the bromine compound was mixed in the pyrolysis oil. In this work, the fraction of {{acrylonitrile butadiene}} styrene “ABS” containing brominated flame retardants was pyrolyzed by using a reflux-condenser apparatus installation at 450 °C. And we used additives of sodium hydroxide “NaOH”, calcium hydroxide “Ca(OH) 2 ” and scallop shell. The total bromine compounds in product oil could be reduced from 296 mg/L to 27 mg/L by NaOH...|$|R

40|$|A report {{describes}} an improved high-voltage isolator for preventing electrical discharge along the flow {{path of a}} propellant gas being fed from a supply at a spacecraft <b>chassis</b> <b>electrical</b> potential to an ion thruster at a potential as high as multiple kilovolts. The isolator must survive launch vibration and must remain electrically nonconductive for thousands of hours under conditions that, {{in the absence of}} proper design, would cause formation of electrically conductive sputtered metal, carbon, and/or decomposed hydrocarbons on its surfaces. The isolator includes an alumina cylinder containing a spiral channel filled with a porous medium made from alumina microbeads fired together with an alumina slurry. Connections to gas-transport tubes are made {{at both ends of the}} alumina cylinder by means of metal caps containing fine-mesh screens to prevent passage of loose alumina particles. The outer surface of the alumina cylinder is convoluted to lengthen the electrical path between the metal caps and to afford shadow shielding to minimize the probability of formation of a continuous deposit that would electrically connect the ends. A flanged cylindrical metal cap that surrounds the alumina cylinder without touching one of the ends provides additional shadow shielding...|$|R
40|$|Clean diesel {{technology}} {{can help to}} improve Tehran's environmental and air quality. Reducing emissions from existing diesel engines with the existing technologies provides {{one of the most}} cost-effective solutions to achieve real and immediate air quality benefits. Diesel engines are significant contributors to air pollution. In order to reduce air pollution, diesel engines can be retrofitted with after-treatment pollution control devices to achieve sufficient reductions. Many retrofit technologies have shown significant emission reductions, on both stationary and mobile diesel engines. Installing retrofit technologies is beneficial to the environment and human health. In order to obtain diesel engine technologies in Iran, a project of installing of QD 32 (diesel engine) on Nissan Z 24 (gasoline engine) was complimented by Mega Motors company. The project was carried out in three phases: Phase I- The Feasibility Study: Study of advantages & disadvantages of diesel engines with comparison to gasoline engines and selection of proper engine. Phase II- Modeling & Adaptation of Engine on the Vehicle: Investigating necessary changes about inlet-outlet System, fuelling, exhaust, cooling, <b>electrical,</b> transmission and <b>chassis</b> systems. Phase III- the Performance, fuel consumption & emissions tests, Air to Boil, Durability, handling and validation. After the installation of diesel engin...|$|R
