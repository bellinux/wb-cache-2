40|$|Economists often praise entrepreneurs' merits {{since they}} {{challenge}} market routine and give life to capitalism. But, paradoxically (?), the entrepreneur holds a marginal place in economic progress historical approaches. Is he a deus ex machina who intervenes when economists {{do not know}} how (or do not want) to reveal the origins of social change dynamics. The fact remains that the <b>enterprise</b> <b>creator</b> benefits from opportunities deriving from market imperfections and that he gets richer while slipping in activities left by the immense mechanism of the economy merchant socialisation. The margin which lets this social agent emerge is made of large enterprise deconcentration process and also the flexible employment and public service privatisation State policies. ...|$|E

40|$|If {{you want}} to sell what the client buys, {{you should see the}} world through the client’s eyes! [...] . » To what extend this evident Marketing and Value Management rule is true for the Non-for-Profit Organisations of Enterprise Development Support {{subjected}} to the inter-cultural contact, whether it would be an accompanying agency for the immigrant entrepreneurs in France or an international enterprise development mission in a transitional economy country? To bring some elements of reply to this question, the authors are basing on the ethno-methodological observations, {{as well as on the}} action-research, realised in frame and for the account of such organisations. As a result, they suggest that these organisations and their staff members are to realise a simultaneous double appropriation effort. Indeed, the appropriation endeavour is necessary in regards with both, the classical management tools usage but also the intercultural variable. It is shown that, in the case of the Accompanying to the immigrant <b>enterprise</b> <b>creators</b> in France, their interaction with the Accompanying structure appears to be complicated by a supplementary intercultural psychological arbitration. This process, in turn, influences the accompanying agent. Subsequently, the relation between the Entrepreneur and the Support Provider could be described as a co-appropriation relation: the support provider has to appropriate the entrepreneur’s project, his cultural identity and his Acculturation strategy, while the entrepreneur is to appropriate the corresponding management tools of enterprise creation. Such co-appropriation constitutes a necessary condition for the true efficacy of the above Provider-Entrepreneur relation. Thus, this intercultural support relationship is modelled in terms of a dynamic matrix that is presently used as a management tool at one of the French entrepreneurial support devices (Boutiques de Gestion). The authors then discuss its possible transposition on the international aid programs for Enterprise (SME) Development Support in the transitional countries and the consequences of such transpositio...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{companies}} {{need to focus}} on efficiency problems, assuring, at the same time, products to be compliant with quality standards, providing a full product support and managing suppliers' and customers’ relationships. According to these needs, product is reassuming a central role as <b>enterprise</b> value <b>creator.</b> In literature, many authors agree that a correct and effective management of the product lifecycle could reduce costs by gaining, meanwhile, a higher customer satisfaction and brand loyalty. This kind of approach needs an integrated management of all product-related information and calls for a wide standardisation activity. Today, a data model, capable of collecting all the information regarding the product along its lifecycle, is still missing. This article aims at providing a concrete answer to this urgent industrial need, presenting the steps taken towards {{the creation of a new}} product lifecycle management standard, named life cycle data management. The development of this new standard is an effort to provide an effective and reliable information model to manage all product lifecycle data and information...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the business creation process (BCP) and successful practices reasoning effectuation (effectual logic) combined or {{not with the}} reasoning by causation - causal logic {{of the theory of}} "cause and effect" among entrepreneurs. From our research question: how do you create a successful business and how it solves-critical incidents related to business creation, we study the steps that entrepreneurs have used in 10 th arrondissement of Paris to identify socioeconomic data and unpublished resources and territorial characteristics such as contingencies to succeed in business creation process (BCP). Our research problem leads actually in a logical continuum seeking to understand the processes that followed the activity creating successful projects and the methods of resolution of critical incidents related to business creation. By incident means a difficulty (by extension a problem, an obstacle) that occurs during the project creation and whose consequences can be critical or severe if it is not resolved by the creators of activities. The critical nature (or severe) here refers to what is not in their routine. This means that such an incident can result in the abandonment of the creative process in progress or slow down or lead to its cessation. Therefore, we can assume that their occurrence {{may be related to the}} context of the territory (eg, institutional factors or structural conditions of the installation place), type of resources mobilized in question or to the tools and methods used. To answer this research question we selected three research hypothesis, namely: The H 1 hypothesis that matches causation (described as dominant approach in <b>enterprise</b> environments <b>creators)</b> where it assumes that the entrepreneur succeeds its business creation process (BCP) it is well trained in the business schools with the right tools (business model) and the right methods (value analysis) that simply replicate or duplicate in any context regardless of situations or contingencies favorable or not. Otherwise if it is sufficiently trained and qualifed in academic circles. Next comes the H 2 hypothesis effectuation that weakens or caricature H 1 should we consider this time that the entrepreneur succeeds his (BCP) if he can build a situation of unusual or unexpected opportunity of made specific qualities of its own such as charisma, personality and rival individual capacities (that is to say almost unequal individual capacities in nature). These two hypotheses H 1 and H 2 are based on the work of Sarasvathy (publication 2001 c, a, b and following year). Finally comes the hypothesis 3 which is involved in this tension between H 1 and H 2 for their questioning. For hypothesis 3 (Territory) the entrepreneur succeeds his (BCP) when it can integrate into its business plan to create the role of territory with facilitative resources (not binding). In other words, an institutional framework enabling or facilitating of devices such as policy development and promotion of entrepreneurship on the territory or in the place of installation of these activities. And in this case for H 3, training and entrepreneur's qualifications (H 1), charisma and personality (H 2) is irrelevant...|$|R
