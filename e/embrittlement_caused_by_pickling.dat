40|$|This work {{highlights}} the solder joints reliability issues {{emerged during the}} development of a novel compliant contacting technology. The peculiar process in this technology is a mechanical lifting procedure in which a pulling force is exerted onto 63 Sn- 37 Pb (eutectic) solder joints (realized by a flux-less thermo compression process), releasing metal traces from the substrate, to form free standing vertical structures. Since joints mechanical characteristics are critical for the successful fabrication of contacts, different bonding conditions (inert or forming atmosphere, temperature rates) and surface finishing (electroplated gold and preformed solder) have been tested. SEM and EDX analyses have been performed on failing joints to investigate failure causes and classify defect typologies. A constantly higher failure rate (percent number of failing joints) has been observed on gold finished surfaces. Analyses proved that such unusual rate was due to contamination of gold surface left by additives in the plating bath and to the <b>embrittlement</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> gold diffusion into molten solder.

40|$|Duplex {{stainless}} steels (DSS) are used widely in chemical plants, {{oil and gas}} production and transportation, offshore drilling, and pipeline applications because of their superior performance in comparison to traditional SS. 1 - 3 The alloy content and microstructure determine their good corrosion resistance and mechanical properties. If the percentage of ferrite is increased, the strength is increased. Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) resistance in chloride environments also is increased in comparison to that of conventional austenitic SS, while increases in the austenite amount improves toughness. The balance between ferrite and austenite depends upon composition of the alloy and the thermal history. During heat treatments of DSS, some transformations involving the precipitation of sigma (), chi (), and R intermetallic phases, body-centered cubic (bcc) ferrite, various carbides, and chromium nitrides can take place. 4 - 10 These transformations induce marked changes in mechanical properties of these alloys, such as <b>embrittlement</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> the presence of and the decrease in toughness <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> the phase.

40|$|International audienceThe Finite Element (FE) {{computations}} {{of complete}} aircraft structures subjected to impact loads requires {{the use of}} ``super-elements'' for the modelling of the riveted assemblies. Macro-elements for the fastener have been developed and validated, but, the structural <b>embrittlement</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> holes in the sheets is not taken into account in this modelling.

The new perforated super-element is first validated by considering no loads applied on the nodes of the hole boundary. It is shown that the results obtained with the new super-element are very accurate whatever the test-case considered (e. g., tension, shear) and that the super-element is cost-efficient.

In this paper, our nanostructured W materials development performed so far to solve the key issue is reviewed, including new original data. Firstly, the basic concept of mitigation of the embrittlement is shown. The approach to the concept has yielded ultra-fine grained, recrystallized (UFGR) W–(0. 25 – 1. 5) mass%TiC compacts containing fine TiC dispersoids (precipitates). The UFGR W–(0. 25 – 1. 5) %TiC exhibits favorable as well as unfavorable features from the viewpoints of microstructures and various thermo-mechanical properties including the response to neutron and ion irradiations. Most of the unfavorable features stem from insufficient strengthening of weak random grain boundaries (GBs) in the recrystallized state. The focal point on this study is, therefore, to develop a new microstructural modification method to significantly strengthen the random GBs. The method is designated as GSMM (GB Sliding-based Microstructural Modification) and has lead to the birth of toughened, fine-grained W– 1. 1 %TiC in the recrystallized state (TFGR W– 1. 1 TiC).

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Duplex {{stainless}} steels (DSS) are an attractive potential material in nuclear power generation systems {{due to an}} excellent combination of corrosion resistance, strength, toughness, and affordability. Thermal <b>embrittlement</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> phase instability in the temperature range of ~ 300 - 550 °C severely limits the service temperature of DSS. The rate of embrittlement varies markedly among commercial alloys. Specifically, alloys with high concentrations of Cr, Ni, and Mo are thought to demonstrate an enhanced rate of thermal embrittlement. The present study investigates a set of standard and lean grade wrought (2003, 2101, and 2205) and weld (2209 -w and 2101 -w) alloys {{in order to better}} understand how alloying elements affect thermal embrittlement. Samples were aged at 427 °C for up to 10, 000 hours, and the embrittlement was assessed via nanoindentation testing. Furthermore, the phase transformations were characterized with atom probe tomography. The results show that there are apparent compositional factors that greatly influence both the phase instability and the resulting embrittlement. The lean grade alloys demonstrated less hardening and embrittlement compared to the standard grade alloys. The reduced concentration of Mo and Ni in the lean grade alloys was found to be the most likely explanation for the reduced mechanical degradation...|$|R

At low stress intensities near-threshold [delta]K₀ ([delta]K = Kmax - Kmin), water vapor in the environment was found to produce a pronounced effect on the fatigue resistance for partial pressures as low as 10 torr. In 2 1 / 4 Cr- 1 %Mo SA 378 - 2 - 22 steel the crack propagation rates at high load ratio (R = Kmin-Kmax) are increased {{in the presence of}} water vapor and the opposite effect is observed at low load ratio. It is proposed that water vapor-containing environments give rise to two mechanisms affecting crack growth rates: <b>embrittlement</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> hydrogen produced in the water-metal reaction; and crack closure, enhanced by the increased surface roughness and the wedging action of the oxidation product.

The goal of this investigation was to find solutions to nondestructively assess both embrittlement and fatigue in this material and to better understand their mutual interaction. In order to simulate the practical load situation in an accelerated manner, samples of different initial state were exposed to low cycle fatigue (LCF) at temperatures between RT and 350 °C.

30|$|The present {{manuscript}} {{is focused}} on the genesis of intermediate-depth intraslab earthquakes. The transformational faulting model applies only for events that occur at the great depths of the mantle transition zone; therefore, it is not applicable to intermediate-depth events. Dehydration-related embrittlement is thought to be a promising hypothesis as a mechanism of lowering frictional strength sufficiently to generate intermediate-depth intraslab events (Nishiyama, 1992; Kirby, 1995; Seno and Yamanaka, 1996). According to this hypothesis, temperature and pressure increase within the slab with subduction, and as a result, hydrous minerals that have been fixed in the slab are decomposed. H 2 O is liberated by this process then lowers the effective normal stress. This effect would allow brittle faulting or dynamic slip along a fault even at depths with high lithostatic pressure. The traditional dehydration embrittlement hypothesis refers only to the embrittlement of rock that occurs during dehydration reactions. In a broader sense, however, dehydration-related embrittlement may also include the <b>embrittlement</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> fluid released through dehydration reactions at any distance from the fault and at any time (e.g., Barcheck et al. 2012). We use the term in the latter, broader sense. The thermal shear instability model is another plausible mechanism for causing not only deep-focus earthquakes but also intermediate-depth intraslab seismicity. In some recent studies, the results of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations have supported this hypothesis (e.g., Kelemen and Hirth, 2007; Chernak and Hirth, 2011; Proctor and Hirth 2015).|$|R

The major obstacle to their use is <b>embrittlement</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> neutron irradiation. Observations on this irradiation embrittlement will be reviewed. Below 425 - 450 {degrees}C, neutron irradiation hardens the steels. Hardening reduces ductility, but the major effect {{is an increase in}} the ductile-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) and a decrease in the upper-shelf energy, as measured by a Charpy impact test. After irradiation, DBTT values can increase to well above room temperature, thus increasing the chances of brittle rather than ductile fracture. In addition to irradiation hardening, neutrons from the fusion reaction will produce large amounts of helium in the steels used to construct fusion power plant components. Tests to simulate the fusion environment indicate that helium can also affect the toughness. Steels are being developed for fusion applications that have a low DBTT prior to irradiation and then show only a small shift after irradiation.

Temperature interaction testing was performed by cycling between 316 °C and 649 °C in blocks of 1, 10 and 100 cycles. Load interaction testing {{in the form of}} single overloads was performed at 316 °C and 649 °C. After compiling a database of constant temperature, constant amplitude FCGR data for IN 100, fatigue crack growth predictions assuming no load or temperature interactions were made. Experimental fatigue crack propagation data was then compared and contrasted with these predictions. Through the aid of scanning electron microscopy the fracture mechanisms observed during interaction testing were compared with the mechanisms present during constant temperature, constant amplitude testing. One block alternating temperature interaction testing grew significantly faster than the non-interaction prediction, while ten block alternating temperature interaction testing also grew faster but not to the same extent. One hundred block alternating testing grew slower than non-interaction predictions. It was found that as the number of alternating temperature cycles increased, changes in the gamma prime morphology (and hence deformation mode) caused changes in the environmental interactions thus demonstrating the sensitivity of the environmental interaction on the details of the deformation mode. SEM fractography was used to show that at low alternating cycles, 316 °C crack growth was accelerated due to crack tip <b>embrittlement</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> 649 °C cycling. At higher alternating cycles the 316 °C cycling quickly grew through the embrittled crack tip but then grew slower than expected due to the possible formation of Kear-Wilsdorf locks at 649 °C. Overload interaction testing led to full crack retardation at 2. 0 x overloads for both 316 °C and 649 °C testing. 1. 6 x overloading at both temperatures led to retarded crack growth whereas 1. 3 x overloads at 649 °C created accelerated crack growth and at 316 °C the crack growth was retarded.

Our recent studies have shown that an important factor of main pipelines serviceability loss under their long-term service is the in-bulk metal degradation of the pipe wall. This leads to the loss of the initial mechanical properties, primarily, resistance to brittle fracture, which were set in engineering calculations at the pipeline design stage. At the same time stress corrosion cracking has been identified as one of the predominant failures in pipeline steels in humid environments, which causes rupture of high-pressure gas transmission pipes as well as serious economic losses and disasters. In the present work the low-carbon pipeline steels with different strength levels {{from the point of view}} of their susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking in the as-received state and after in-laboratory accelerated degradation under environmental conditions similar to those of an acidic soil were investigated.

The procedure of accelerated degradation of pipeline steels was developed and introduced in laboratory under the combined action of axial loading and hydrogen charging. It proved to be reliable and useful to performed laboratory simulation of in-service degradation of pipeline steels with different strength.

We define a ratcheting ratio to quantify the interaction of creep and cyclic plasticity on the accumulated inelastic strain per cycle. The second part of the dissertation focuses on solving the asymptotic stress and strain field near the tip of a plane strain Mode I stationary crack in a viscoplastic material. For small scale creep where the region of inelasticity is small in comparison with typical specimen dimensions, our asymptotic and finite element analysis show that the near tip stress field has the same singularity as elastic power law creeping materials with a time dependent amplitude. This amplitude is found to vanish at long times and the elastic K field dominates. For the case of cyclic loading, we study the effect of stress ratio on inelastic strain and find that the strain accumulated per cycle decreases with stress ratio. iii The third part of the dissertation carries out finite element simulations on the planar deformation of random sized power law creeping grains with sliding and cavitating boundaries. Grain boundary sliding and grain boundary separation due to cavity nucleation and growth are incorporated into a cohesive zone model. Finite element simulation of a relaxation test shows that more grain boundary separation occurs in a microstructure with sliding resistant grain boundaries than in a microstructure with more freely sliding grain boundaries. The overall inelastic strain rate of the microstructure in uniaxial tension test is found to be greatly enhanced by grain boundary sliding and grain boundary cavitation. Finally, we extend the cohesive zone model in the third part of the dissertation to account for interface <b>embrittlement</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> grain boundary impurities. Finite element simulation of an uniaxial creep test using a two dimensional random grain structure shows that grain boundary cavitation and interface embrittlement are two competing mechanisms for grain boundary separation. The occurrence of one grain boundary separation mode would slow down or even inhibit the other. iv 2018 - 01 - 2...|$|R
40|$|Plastic {{deformation}} of tungsten wire {{is an effective}} source of toughening tungsten fibre-reinforced tungsten composites (Wf/W) and other tungsten fibre-reinforced composites. To provide a reference for optimization of those composites, unconstrained pure tungsten wire is studied after various heat treatments in terms of microstructure, mechanical behaviour and fracture mode. Recrystallization is already observed at a relatively low temperature of 1273 K due to the large driving force <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> a high dislocation density. Annealing for 30 min at 1900 K also leads to recrystallization, but causes a rather different microstructure. As-fabricated wire and wire recrystallized at 1273 K for 3 h show fine grains with a high aspect ratio and a substantial plastic deformability: a clearly defined tensile strength, high plastic work, similar necking shape, and the characteristic knife-edge-necking of individual grains on the fracture surface. While the wire recrystallized at 1900 K displays large, almost equiaxed grains with low aspect ratios as well as distinct brittle properties. Therefore, {{it is suggested that}} a high aspect ratio of the grains is important for the ductile behaviour of tungsten wire and that <b>embrittlement</b> is <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> the loss of the preferable elongated grain structure rather than by recrystallization. In addition, a detailed evaluation of the plastic deformation behaviour during tensile test gives guidance to the design and optimization of tungsten fibre-reinforced composites...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{smoothness}} {{is one of}} {{the properties}} determining the performance of stents. Therefore, surface polishing shows its importance in the exploitation and production of stents. The present study explores electrochemical polishing of 316 L stainless steel slotted tube coronary stents produced by laser cutting. Acid pickling was also studied as a pre-treatment of electrochemical polishing of the stents to remove the slag (oxides) formed in the production of the stents. Meanwhile, removal of the material was measured as well, <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> both acid <b>pickling</b> and electrochemical polishing processes. It is found that the slag formed on the surface of stents due to the laser cutting production process could be removed by means of acid pickling. Electrochemical polishing results in a smooth stent surface. Meanwhile, both acid pickling and electrochemical polishing applied in the present study have a proper removal of the stent material.

Failed anchor rods made of AIS 309 SS were analyzed for chemical composition, hardness, tensile strength and microstructural condition. Sigma (s) phase induced <b>embrittlement</b> <b>caused</b> failure of anchor at the non-welded end. At the anchor-MS plate weld, poor quality of the weld was noted. Overheating from flue gas entry in the gaps <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> inadequate expansion joints resulted in damage to the backup insulation layers. At such high temperatures, the SS anchor-MS weld will have a lesser strength and weld failure occurred. Loss of anchor reinforcement resulted in falling of refractories...|$|R
