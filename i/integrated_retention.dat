40|$|The {{frequency}} of peripheral blood erythrocyte variants exhibiting allelic loss of glycophorin A (N/M antigen) {{has been used}} previously as a biological dosimeter to assess somatic mutations in bone marrow cells from external whole-body irradiation. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine whether this marker could be used as a measure of bone marrow genotoxicity induced by 131 I in the treatment of thyroid cancer. Flow cytometry of immunolabeled erythrocytes was performed to enumerate glycophorin A variants before and after eight therapy doses of 131 I administered to five patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Bone marrow radiation exposure from each dose was calculated from the <b>integrated</b> <b>retention</b> of 131 I in the whole body and in the blood. In addition, the accumulated dose to the bone marrow received from earlier 131 I therapy was calculated for each patient. Regression analysis was performed on the {{frequency of}} two glycophorin A variant cell types (N/O and N/N) as a function of accumulated dose to the bone marrow. Frequency of N/O variant cells showed a significant dose-related increase with a slope of 10. 9 x 10 (- 6) per sievert. This dose effect is about one-half that previously observed after whole-body external irradiation at high dose rate. This decreased response could be explained by the low dose rate of the radiation to the bone marrow from 131 I...|$|E
40|$|MBA thesis - WBSNotwithstanding {{numerous}} {{legislative and}} transformation interventions embarked {{upon by the}} South African government to eradicate institutional discrimination and transform the upper echelons of corporate structures, the progress made thus far has been very slow and remains dismal. This study endeavoured to assess the success factors pertaining to the retention of senior African managers in the South African financial services sector context. Specifically, the research identified the success factors enunciated in the literature and then assessed {{whether or not the}} application of those success factors contributed to the retention of African managers. The researcher made use of qualitative methods {{in the form of an}} in–depth descriptive case analysis and semi-structured in-depth interviews. This study sanctions the findings of national and international research that assert that the absence of strategically aligned, consistent and <b>integrated</b> <b>retention</b> strategies, the lack of awareness creation and insufficient communication around retention management initiatives, the absence of visible implementation, execution and evaluation of retention management initiatives, inconsistent recruitment and selection processes and lack of accountability and responsibility for non-compliance of retention initiatives congruent with employment equity legislation, the absence of sufficient inclusionary networking opportunities, the lack of black mentors; and the internal dilution of the external employment value proposition are some of the major factors which could and do inhibit the retention of African managers. The results suggest that intention and commitment of the top leadership to make retention of African managers a core business imperative will fail if that intention is not supported by visible action and effective employee management practice...|$|E

We used data of a large opioid substitution treatment case register to (1) identify associated factors and (2) <b>integrate</b> <b>retention</b> and readmission into a model of overall participation over subsequent treatment episodes of various groups. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Data of all 9, 407 patients undergoing 26, 545 methadone or buprenorphine substitution treatment episodes between 1992 and 2012 in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland, were analyzed. We used extended survival analysis to estimate the duration of, and time between, treatment episodes, with the number of episodes, gender, nationality, administration route, age at onset of first regular heroin use, and provider type as independent variables. A similar analysis was applied to estimate overall participation (the probability of being in treatment at a given day after first entry independent of current number of treatment episode) and to test for group differences. RESULTS: The time between treatment episodes shortened with the increasing number of episodes. Retention slightly increased after the first episode and then shortened for later treatment episodes. Effect sizes were generally rather weak (odds ratio ≤ 1. 47). Effects were usually equal for all episodes, and if changing, weakened for later episodes. CONCLUSION: The complex process of leaving and entering treatment as well as the daily probability of being in treatment independent of treatment episode can be predicted by comprehensible statistical models applied to patient-period data sets...|$|R

40|$|This review {{discusses}} {{the retention of}} organometallic catalysts in continuous flow processes utilizing supercritical carbon dioxide. Due to its innovative properties, supercritical carbon dioxide offers interesting possibilities for process intensification. As a result of safety and cost considerations, processes that use supercritical carbon dioxide are preferably done in continuous flow, as they require a pressure upwards of 74 bar. Many of the reactions that benefit from the application of supercritical carbon dioxide also involve {{the use of a}} homogeneous catalyst however, requiring efforts to recycle the catalyst when these are applied in continuous flow. Alternatively, the catalyst may be retained in the reactor by modifying the process or catalyst, such as by catalyst immobilization, membrane separation, or biphasic processing exploiting the properties of supercritical carbon dioxide.

40|$|Biomolecular assays are {{continually}} being developed that use progressively smaller amounts of material, often precluding {{the use of}} conventional cuvette-based instruments for nucleic acid quantitation for those that can perform microvolume quantitation. The NanoDrop microvolume sample retention system (Thermo Scientific NanoDrop Products) functions by combining fiber optic technology and natural surface tension properties to capture and retain minute amounts of sample independent of traditional containment apparatus such as cuvettes or capillaries. Furthermore, the system employs shorter path lengths, which result in {{a broad range of}} nucleic acid concentration measurements, essentially eliminating the need to perform dilutions. Reducing the volume of sample required for spectroscopic analysis also facilitates the inclusion of additional quality control steps throughout many molecular workflows, increasing efficiency and ultimately leading to greater confidence in downstream results. The need for high-sensitivity fluorescent analysis of limited mass has also emerged with recent experimental advances. Using the same microvolume sample retention technology, fluorescent measurements may be performed with 2 μL of material, allowing fluorescent assays volume requirements to be significantly reduced. Such microreactions of 10 μL or less are now possible using a dedicated microvolume fluorospectrometer.

40|$|Background: Workforce {{development}} is a critical factor allowing delivery on government health priorities. Against a backdrop of increasing demand for dental therapists being {{significantly higher than the}} levels of recruitment, it is widely acknowledged that rural and remote areas (having greater recruitment and retention issues) will face a significant shortfall in therapist numbers as the workforce shortages take hold in dentistry. This study analysed the reasons for dental therapists leaving the profession, and factors that would promote the recruitment and retention of dental therapists, especially in rural and remote areas. Methods: A postal survey was undertaken amongst all registered dental therapists in Western Australia between the years 1999 – 2003. Results: Of all respondents, 28 per cent indicated that they do not work as dental therapists anymore. A number of reasons for leaving the profession were highlighted, including family reasons, career change, poor salaries, relocation, illness and injury, and stress. To increase retention and recruitment of dental therapists to rural areas, a number of opportunities were highlighted by respondents, including increased salaries, living support, travel assistance, access to continuing education, recruitment of more rural students and more flexibility (including job sharing). Conclusion: This survey has highlighted various opportunities to recruit and retain dental therapists in their profession and to increase the numbers of rural dental therapists.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} a conceptual classification model for Sustainable Flood Retention Basins (SFRB) used to control runoff in temperate climates. The author has defined a SFRB as an aesthetically pleasing (from the general publics' point of view) retention basin, predominantly used for flood protection and adhering to sustainable drainage and best management practices. The classification model concept was developed on the basis of an example database of 147 SFRB in Baden-Württemberg (Germany). The data were of high quality because the researchers had detailed local knowledge of the case study area. The model quality was improved on the basis of a more detailed case study of The Kaiserstuhl, a region (no clearly defined boundaries) with a very high density of flood retention basins (one SFRB per 2 km 2; 51 sites in total). The model is based on an agglomerative cluster analysis and is intended to be used by landscape planners, environmental engineers, and environmental scientists to adequately classify the following different types of SFRB with the purpose of improving communication among stakeholders: Hydraulic Flood Retention Basin, Traditional Flood Retention Basin, Sustainable Flood Retention Wetland, Aesthetic Flood <b>Retention</b> Wetland, <b>Integrated</b> Flood <b>Retention</b> Wetland, and Natural Flood Retention Wetland.

40|$|PhD (Development and Management), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Skilled labour {{retention}} {{continues to}} receive attention from researchers {{as a critical}} challenge faced by organisations globally. The loss of skilled labour in an organisation contributes to the high labour replacement costs, which may result in an organisation‟s failure to achieve its mandate since it is deprived of its high performance, experienced and knowledgeable labour. Organisations must, therefore, be able to diagnose the {{factors that contribute to}} the loss of skilled labour and implement strategies that could assist in the mitigation of such losses. Consequently, an integrated model for skilled labour retention in the Botswana Police Service was developed. The literature study which explored the phenomenon of skilled labour retention, revealed a deficiency of a universal implementation strategy that guides organisations in managing skilled labour retention. However, human resources management literature unanimously concur that in order to implement an effective skilled labour retention strategy, it is necessary for organisations to devise a unique human resources management strategy aimed at addressing their individual causes of skilled labour turnover. This study utilised human resource management best practices, theories and frameworks to develop an <b>integrated</b> skilled labour <b>retention</b> model for the Botswana Police Service. The study followed both the qualitative and quantitative research design. Skilled labour retention factors that should be included in a skilled labour retention model were identified through an analysis of a scholarly literature review, a closed-ended questionnaire and an analysis of official documentation. The identified skilled labour retention factors were included in the proposed retention model. The study also proposed an implementation strategy that should be followed when implementing the proposed skilled labour retention model. The empirical study investigated the validity of the identified retention factors that {{should be included in the}} <b>integrated</b> skilled labour <b>retention</b> model for the Botswana Police Service. The retention factors entail: job satisfaction, organisational commitment, work-life balance, remuneration, career development, development opportunities (learning, training and development), work environment, decisionmaking and management style. Before the retention factors could be included in the new retention model, the researcher determined the current arrangements in the organisation to establish the status quo. Interviews were held with senior management in the Botswana Police Service to ascertain the aforementioned. It was established that the current retention arrangements impeded the retention of skilled labour in the organisation, which contextualised the significance to develop the new skilled labour retention model.

40|$|Effective spatial {{navigation}} is enabled by reliable reference cues {{that derive from}} sensory information from the external environment, {{as well as from}} internal sources such as the vestibular system. The integration of information from these sources enables dead reckoning in the form of path integration. Navigation in the dark is associated with the accumulation of errors in terms of perception of allocentric position and this may relate to error accumulation in path integration. We assessed this by recording from place cells in the dark under circumstances where spatial sensory cues were suppressed. Spatial information content, spatial coherence, place field size, and peak and infield firing rates decreased whereas sparsity increased following exploration in the dark compared to the light. Nonetheless it was observed that place field stability in darkness was sustained by border information in a subset of place cells. To examine the impact of encountering the environment’s border on navigation, we analyzed the trajectory and spiking data gathered during navigation in the dark.

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{examine the impact of}} housing child welfare ongoing teams in the community, near client neighborhoods, and in a setting that also co-locates other service {{providers}} that serve the same clients. The focus was the impact of location and service integration on perceptions of worker stress and actual worker turnover. Thirty four workers from this type of setting and from a more traditional setting in two urban cities in a Southern state were interviewed. In addition turnover rates were calculated and compared. It was found that those located near clients and with staff from other agencies had better morale, lower stress levels, more positive attitudes toward clients and client contexts, knew more about the communities the clients lived in and had more chances to collaborate to solve client problems than those in a more traditional setting with co-location only with family support staff. The turnover rate was lower in the integrated service delivery setting than in either the traditional setting or the state overall. Thus, integration of service delivery benefits not only the child welfare workforce participants, but also the clients who have greater access to other service providers and to the bottom line of the agency through the retention of workers.

40|$|The oldest {{members of}} the post-World War 2 baby boomer {{generation}} — born between 1945 and 1963 — are soon nearing retirement, reducing or reviewing {{the extent of their}} participation in the workforce in the future. This has significant implications, especially for organisations relying on knowledge workers‘ expertise and experience, as within this cohort resides knowledge that is valuable to organisations. In New Zealand, the problem is twofold. First, Generation X — born between 1964 and 1981 — is numerically only 75 % {{of the size of the}} baby boomer cohort. The workforce as a whole is predicted to grow at a slower rate after 2016 than it has between 1991 and 2006. Second, organisations will lose valuable knowledge if they do not act to remedy the potential impacts of this demographic phenomenon. The research topic is relevant at a time when few organisations have given serious consideration to the loss of expertise. There is extensive literature on the baby boomer generation, and on the information and communications technologies that exist to support knowledge-related activities such as capture and storage, facilitating access, and sharing and dissemination. However, less specific information was found on the infrastructure or processes for successfully retaining the knowledge of older experts. Do organisations know who the experts are and how their expertise may be retained? This action research study using qualitative methods explores how two organisations define the types of knowledge they will lose when experts leave. An in-depth study of one organisation‘s infrastructure and processes for retaining the knowledge of a specific expert in a key business setting, reveals that his expertise was valued but less understood. The study identified similarities between some characteristics of the expert‘s expertise and elements of wisdom. The findings are presented with reference to an existing research framework pertaining to wisdom as a type of expert knowledge. The framework was adaptable as a representation of the older expert‘s knowledge, and could also be related to the organisation‘s knowledge retention process. The study‘s contribution is a model that <b>integrates</b> knowledge <b>retention</b> with the knowledge framework of an older expert.

40|$|MBA thesisSustained {{distributor}} {{growth that}} consistently achieves product sales and stated revenue objectives is {{the lifeblood of}} Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) organisations (Legara, Monterola, Juanico, Linton-Palima & Saloma, 2008). This {{is due to the}} various roles and functions that MLM distributors perform within MLM organisations (Alturas, 2003) such as, sales generation, recruiting of more distributors; new distributor training, distributor motivation, and order control (Msweli-Mbanga & Sargeant, 2001). MLM distributor attraction and retention are therefore of fundamental importance to MLM organisations. In light of this, {{the purpose of this study}} is to provide insight into the factors influencing the attraction, participation and retention of these MLM distributors in South Africa. A research questionnaire was constructed based on the available literature and was primarily distributed electronically. Of the 238 responses obtained, 183 were accepted as valid and the collected data was then subjected to various quantitative analyses with exploratory factor analysis being the technique selected for identifying factors influencing distributor attraction and participation. T tests and effect size analyses were then employed over and above factor analysis as secondary techniques in order to identify the factors influencing distributor retention. The results showed that factors pertaining to career and personal development, industry attractiveness and time flexibility, and income generation opportunities were the factors influencing distributor attraction into the MLM industry. Once engaged with the industry as a whole, potential distributors decided to participate in specific MLM organisations due to the factors pertaining to company image and success, the product affiliation of the potential distributors, and the outcomes of the distributors’ own investigations. Once successfully recruited, the study revealed the factors influencing distributor retention to be the distributors’ views of the marketing mix, distributor development and company performance, the network and sales growth ii achieved, satisfaction with income, product usage and entrepreneurship, valuing of relationships, and the organisational support received. The underlying key findings for this research being that MLM organisations must be collective custodians of the industry as a whole. They must seek out and address any negative sentiments regarding the industry and positioning the industry favourably in the eyes of the broader public in order to ensure the MLM industry is attractive to potential distributors. In addition, MLM organisations must individually look internally to ensure they are configured for success. This implies developing and acting on approaches to attracting high numbers of quality distributors to their organisations through the understanding of the factors that these potential distributors consider to be important. This should be supplemented by <b>integrated</b> distributor <b>retention</b> strategies to allow the MLM organisations to consistently achieve their desired product sales and revenue objective...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Organisation knowledge attrition continues to gain attention due to the increasing mobility of organisational employees. Employees leave organisations due to retirement, resignation in search for better employment opportunities, termination of employment contracts, indisposition, unofficially leaving employment, and death. When they leave organisations, they take with them tacit knowledge. Attrition of tacit knowledge leads to loss of intellectual assets and erosion of organisational memory which negatively affect learning and innovation. The knowledge can be subject matter expertise, organisational memory of why certain decisions were made, experience of past research and development projects and the social network in terms of from whom they sought out for answers or collaborated with in executing their tasks. Knowledge attrition is common in many organisations in different sectors. The literature does not show any framework that addresses knowledge attrition right from the time an employee is recruited into an organisation to {{when he or she}} leaves it. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop an <b>integrated</b> knowledge <b>retention</b> framework for minimising organisational knowledge attrition. This was achieved by investigating how loss of organisational tacit knowledge can be minimised. The research adopted a single case study design with a concurrent parallel mixed methods research strategy informed by pragmatic philosophical assumptions. It was conducted in Uganda in a large national agricultural research organisation. Data was collected from 36 focus group discussions involving 161 participants, review of organisational documents, 35 interviews, 205 online surveys and a validation workshop by 16 top managers. The main contribution of this research is the novel framework for knowledge retention that comprehensively addresses knowledge attrition from an organisation. The framework comprises two categories of components. The first is the organisational behavioural components comprising knowledge sharing, capturing and documenting knowledge, and knowledge exploitation. This category constitutes the core components of the knowledge retention strategy. The second category is the organisational environmental components. It comprises creating organisational learning environment, having knowledge-oriented governance and leadership, providing necessary capacities and conditions, and providing strategic guidance - planning for knowledge retention. Environmental components have moderating effects on the behavioural components. In addition, it has contributed to the theoretical existing body of knowledge from the framework that was developed. This complements the reviewed literature which uncovered three conceptual categorisations of the knowledge retention strategies based on the timing of capturing knowledge from an individual. The three categories are: Reactive (short-term), Containment (medium-term) and Preventive (long-term) knowledge retention strategies. Although the concept of knowledge retention is not new, this research has contributed to the existing body of literature. Additionally, the study provides a deeper understanding of knowledge retention and opens new research areas. Perhaps this is the first study of its kind in the agricultural sector specifically focussing on agricultural research...|$|R
40|$|Moving beyond ITER {{toward a}} {{demonstration}} power reactor (Demo) {{will require the}} integration of stable high fusion gain in steady-state, advanced methods for dissipating very high divertor heat-fluxes, and adherence to strict limits on in-vessel tritium retention. While ITER will clearly {{address the issue of}} high fusion gain, and new and planned long-pulse experiments (EAST, JT 60 -SA, KSTAR, SST- 1) will collectively address stable steady-state high-performance operation, none of these devices will adequately address the <b>integrated</b> heat-flux, tritium <b>retention,</b> and plasma performance requirements needed for extrapolation to Demo. Expressing power exhaust requirements in terms of P{sub heat}/R, future ARIES reactors are projected to operate with 60 - 200 MW/m, a Component Test Facility (CTF) or Fusion Development Facility (FDF) for nuclear component testing (NCT) with 40 - 50 MW/m, and ITER 20 - 25 MW/m. However, new and planned long-pulse experiments are currently projected to operate at values of P{sub heat}/R no more than 16 MW/m. Furthermore, none of the existing or planned experiments are capable of operating with very high temperature first-wall (T{sub wall} = 600 - 1000 C) which may be critical for understanding and ultimately minimizing tritium retention with a reactor-relevant metallic first-wall. The considerable gap between present and near-term experiments and the performance needed for NCT and Demo motivates the development of the concept for a new experiment [...] the National High-power advanced-Torus eXperiment (NHTX) [...] whose mission is to study the integration of a fusion-relevant plasma-material interface with stable steady-state high-performance plasma operation. Such a device would not have a high-fluence NCT mission, but would advance the science and technology necessary to accelerate the NCT mission at reduced risk in a separate nuclear facility. For the NHTX mission, flexibility to test multiple divertor configurations and first-wall components is critical, and flexibility in plasma exhaust configuration and boundary shape is important for understanding the plasma-wall interaction. Sufficient profile control must be available to generate high-performance fully non-inductive plasmas with high P{sub heat}/R {le} 50 MW/m and long pulses= 200 - 1000 s. Incorporation of hot walls, trace-tritium, liquid metals, and ELM and disruption control are additional design goals...|$|R
