40|$|Optimum <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> in a {{wireless}} power transfer (WPT) system usually occurs only at a specific load value while the load such as a battery is normally not constant. A major challenge in WPT is therefore to achieve <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> over a wide load range. Previously, impedance transformation methods such as DC-DC converters and use of a relay coil, {{have been used to}} transform the practical load resistance to the optimum (or near optimum) value. In this paper, a new approach based on re-configurable magnetic resonant structures is proposed to achieve <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> and low volt-amp ratings. This basic principle is to create more than one efficiency-load curve. The WPT system is controlled to be operated within the top regions of the <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> curves of the reconfigurable circuits so that <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> can be achieved over a very wide load range.
