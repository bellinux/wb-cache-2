Elsewhere, major fisheries, such the northern hemisphere cod fisheries, were collapsing. Fishing companies in New Zealand were able to buy or lease the redundant trawlers cheaply. At the same time, the collapse of northern fisheries resulted in an unmet need in the world market for quality whitefish. Hoki and orange roughy from New Zealand were in demand.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{potential}} of cantabrian anchovy (Engraulis encrarischolus) viscera {{as a source}} of bioactive compounds is of interest for both, pharmaceutical and food industries. Cantabrian anchovy <b>guts</b> <b>and</b> <b>heads</b> were freeze-dried, extracted with methanol and subjected to fractionation by solvent partitioning using hexane, ethyl acetate, and butanol. Fractions were tested for antimutagenic, antioxidant, antifungal, and antibacterial activity using the Ames test; DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP assays; the radial grown inhibition assay; and the microbroth dilution method, respectively. Five fractions were obtained from the anchovy gut methanolic extract, in addition to the hexane- (HF), ethyl acetate- (EAF), and butanol-soluble (BF) fractions, an aqueous-soluble fraction (ALF) and precipitated crystals (ACF) in this were also obtained. HF and EAF resulted to be antimutagenic, HF and ALF showed antifungal activity, BF and ACF showed the highest antioxidant potential, and HF and BF were antibacterial against several strains. Anchovy gut, which to the present study had not been reported for any bioactivity, has antimutagenic, antifungal, antioxidant, and antibacterial compounds, which need to be isolated for full characterization and study...|$|R
5000|$|His {{pharmacological}} {{work was}} a materia medica written in Greek and, according to Erotianus, had the title περὶ ὕλης ("On material", [...] "On medical substances"). Dioscorides calls him a disciple of Asclepiades of Bithynia and speaks slightingly {{of him and}} others of the same school {{for a lack of}} care in investigating the remedies they recommend. Despite this disrespect, it seems clear that Niger was a major source for Dioscorides as he was for Pliny. Many of Pliny's books contain long stretches with close similarities to Dioscorides; and all these books are ones for which Pliny names Niger as one of his sources. Against the old view that Pliny was using Dioscorides, Wellmann notes that sometimes Pliny, sometimes Dioscorides provides a more detailed treatment and that the two were near contemporaries. [...] Unlike Dioscorides, Pliny writes of Niger with great respect as [...] "diligentissimus medicinae" [...] ("a very diligent medical writer"); and Galen also regarded him highly. [...] The work discussed medical effects of both plants and animals; its relation to folk beliefs can be seen in his comments on the salamander:Sextius venerem accendi cibo earum, si detractis interaneis et pedibus et capite in melle serventur, tradit negatque restingui ignem ab iis. Sextius says that sexual desire is increased by eating them, if they are preserved in honey with the <b>guts</b> <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> feet removed, but denies that fire can be put out by them.From an examination of the parallel passages in Dioscorides and Pliny, Wellmann believes that his sources will have included the botanist Theophrastus and the writer on snakes Apollodorus.|$|R

50|$|Once the eel {{has been}} <b>gutted</b> <b>and</b> its <b>head</b> <b>and</b> skin removed, two inch long {{cuttings}} are simmered {{with a mix}} of finely chopped fresh herbs. These may typically be a selection of sage, ginger mint, oregano, sorrel, lemon balm (citronella), chervil, thyme, citrus thyme, savory, parsley, stinging nettle, spearmint, burnet, watercress, dragon's-wort, chives, and basil. Finely chopped shallot, cornflour, a little butter and salt are added. The stew is done as soon as the white flesh could easily be separated from the bone but still stays on when stirred gently; the amount of starch should allow the sauce on a plate after a minute to be a thickly flowing liquid. According to personal preference, a brighter green colour can be achieved by including spinach, though other aficionados reject this. Variations with beer or wine, lemon juice, egg yolk, or even with chicken broth do occur.|$|R

5000|$|Although sympathy is a {{well-known}} term, the implications of sympathy found {{in the study of}} human behavior are often less clear. Decision-making, an integral part of human behavior, involves the weighing of costs with potential outcomes. Research on decision-making has been divided into two mechanisms, often labeled [...] "System 1" [...] and [...] "System 2." [...] These two systems, representing the <b>gut</b> <b>and</b> the <b>head</b> respectively, influence decisions based on context and the individual characteristics of the people involved. Sympathy is an agent working in System 1, a system that uses affective cues to dictate decisions whereas System 2 is based in logic and reason. For example, deciding on where to live based on how the new home feels would be a System 1 decision, whereas deciding on a home based on the property value and personal savings would be a System 2 decision. Sympathy acts in a way that provides a means of understanding another person's experience or situation, good or bad, with a focus on their individual well-being. It is often easier to make decisions based on emotional information, because all humans have general understanding of emotions. It is this understanding of emotions that allows people to use sympathy to make their decisions.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation of whole or gutted meagre stored at 4 ± 1 oC. Whole ungutted (Group A), eviscerated (Group B), beheaded-eviscerated fish (Group C) and fillets (Group D) groups were created for this study. According to fatty acid analysis, it was determined that meagre is rich in PUFA content and the n 3 /n 6 ratio is within the ideal limits. In all 4 groups, obtained from fillets values were the highest in general, quality parameters were found within acceptable limits. Psychrophilic and mesophilic aerobic bacteria counts exceeded the standards for fillet groups on 7 th days of storage. According to microbiological analysis, ungutted, beheaded, eviscerated samples were not exceeded limit values on 9 th day. In conclusion, whole or <b>gutted</b> (<b>headed</b> <b>and</b> eviscerated) storage of meagre is found to be more advantageous compared to fillets for storage at 4 ± 1 oC...|$|R

30|$|At {{the end of}} the {{digestibility}} trial, all experimental {{animals were}} slaughtered after an overnight fasting. Slaughter weight was recorded and animals were killed by severing the jugular vein using a knife. Blood was collected and weighed. The esophagus was tied to prevent the back flow of rumen content while suspending the animals for skinning. The skin was flayed carefully to avoid adherence of fat and muscle tissue to the skin, and was weighed along with legs below the fetlock joints. The weights of the kidney and omental fat, lungs, trachea, esophagus, heart, kidneys, liver with gall bladder, spleen, testis and penis, the entire alimentary canal (esophagus, reticulo-rumen, omasum and abomasum, small intestine and large intestine), full gut, empty <b>gut,</b> tail, tongue <b>and</b> <b>head</b> were recorded separately. Empty body weight was determined by subtracting the gut fill from slaughter body weight. Hot carcass weight was determined by excluding contents of the thoracic, abdominal <b>and</b> pelvic cavities, <b>head,</b> skin, feet <b>and</b> tail of the animal. Dressing percentage was calculated on the bases of slaughter weight and empty body weight as ratio of hot carcass weight to slaughter weight and empty body weight, respectively multiplied by 100.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} of this work was to produce protein hydrolysates from by-products of the Nile tilapia fileting process, and to assess the effects of different hydrolysis times on the antioxidant activity of the hydrolysed animal-based protein, in free form and incorporated into a food matrix. <b>Gutted</b> tilapia <b>heads</b> <b>and</b> carcasses were hydrolysed by Alcalase® for different hydrolysis times producing six hydrolysates. The protein content, degree of hydrolysis, reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, and antioxidant activity by the ORAC, FRAP and TEAC methods were analysed. Three mini-hamburger formulations were produced and the lipidic oxidation of mini-hamburger was determined by TBARS. The protein contained in the residue was completely recovered in the process. The hydrolysates varied in their degree of hydrolysis, but presented similar levels of antioxidant activity. In the mini-hamburgers the hydrolysate was capable of delaying oxidation after 7 days of storage.

40|$|CAMSAP 1 is a spectrin associated, Calmodulin {{regulated}} {{protein that}} {{is a member of}} a large ubiquitous family of cytoskeletal proteins, defined by a novel C-terminal domain, the CKK domain. The CAMSAP family member in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogastor is encoded by the gene short spindles 4 (ssp 4). Little is known about this gene but a role in microtubule dynamics has been shown in cultured cells. I have interrogated bioinformatics databases and compared Ssp 4 with Human CAMSAP proteins and found many similarities, and some differences, between them. Using in situ hybridisation I show that ssp 4 transcripts are expressed in the <b>gut,</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> central nervous system during embryogenesis. An antibody that recognises the Ssp 4 C-terminus reveals expression throughout the embryonic development of the <b>gut</b> <b>and</b> nervous system, and in a discrete population of cells in the head. I have investigated the effects of two independent P-element induced mutant alleles of ssp 4 and show that mutant flies die in late embryonic or early larval stages. Disruptions to the locus do not seem to affect the nervous system but mutants were found to have aberrant head involution. I present preliminary evidence that suggests this defect {{may be the result of}} reduced apoptosis in the embryo. Head involution is a complex process, dependent upon co-ordinated changes to cell shape and the movement of groups of cells from different origins. As Ssp 4 is a multi-domain cytoskeletal protein that is required for embryonic development, it may play a role in processes that are common to these morphogenetic events.
