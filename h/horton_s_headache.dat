These dealt mainly with migraine and included the criteria established by Vahlquist (1955), Deubner (1977) and Prensky and Sommer (1979). During the last 15 years, several studies (Seshia and Wolstein 1994; Metsahonkala and Sillanpaa 1994; Mortimer et al. 1992 a; Wober Bingol et al. 1996; Francis 2002) have proposed revisions to the I H S criteria for children and adolescents with migraine. The major suggestions were to shorten {{the duration of the}} migraine attack to one hour and to remove hemicrania as a criterion since many children have headaches that are bi temporal or bi frontal. An additional suggestion was to require either photophobia or phonophobia instead of both (Winner et al. 1995).|$|R

RAE 2008 Aims and objectives: This project was commissioned by the Yorkshire Museums Libraries & Archives Council (YMLAC) in order to ?increase YMLAC?s and the Archive domain?s knowledge and understanding of the methodologies / approaches available to undertake economic and social impact assessment. ? The objectives were to: - Systematically review the published evidence on economic and social impact assessments adopted in the archives domain, both within the UK and internationally - Develop a taxonomy of usage, based on the need to differentiate primary and secondary users, economic and social impacts - Assess the transferability of other schemes developed for the valuation of information or information services to the archives sector - Develop an impact taxonomy that addresses economic / social impacts over time - Produce a mapping of impact type against methods, noting any particular problems or opportunities in deploying these methodologies. Conclusions and recommendations: Impact assessment for the archives sector has been very limited but the existing evidence at least indicates the type and range of impacts to be expected; there is however insufficient research data of the rigour and scope required for generalisation across the domain. Methodologies that could be applied to the archives domain include SP techniques, which might address some of the difficulties of assessing the impact of secondary usage and the ?non-user?; however, more detailed case studies are necessary to establish the parameters of value, before these could be applied in practice. An approach adapted from the health sector concept of QALYs could offer a way forward. Thought should also be given to whether the level of investment required in developing complex methodologies can be justified by their eventual end-use. Such techniques are dependent on the perceived ?public value? of archives, which highlights the need for further work to raise awareness of the domain and what it does...|$|R

Gooding, L. W. Elmore, A. E. Tollefson, H. A. Brady, and W. S. M. Wold, Cell 53 : 341 - 346, 1988). We have also observed that the E 1 B 19 K protein protects adenovirus-infected human but not mouse cells against TNF lysis (L. R. Gooding, L. Aquino, P. J. Duerksen-Hughes, D. Day, T.

We now report that, {{in the absence of}} E 3 14. 7 K, the E 3 10. 4 K and E 3 14. 5 K proteins are both required to protect C 127 as well as several other mouse cell lines against TNF lysis. The 14. 7 K protein can also protect these cells from TNF {{in the absence of the}} 10. 4 K and 14. 5 K proteins. This protection by the 10. 4 K and 14. 5 K proteins was not observed in the C 3 HA cell line. These conclusions are based on 51 Cr release assays of cells infected with virus E 3 mutants that express the 14. 7 K protein alone, that express both the 10. 4 K and 14. 5 K proteins, and that delete the 14. 7 K in combination with either the 10. 4 K or 14. 5 K protein. The 10. 4 K protein was efficiently coimmunoprecipitated together with the 14. 5 K protein by using an antiserum to the 14. 5 K protein, suggesting that the 10. 4 K and 14. 5 K proteins exist as a complex in the infected mouse cells and consistent with the notion that they function in concert. Considering that three sets of proteins (E 3 14. 7 K, E 1 B 19 K, and E 3 10. 4 K/ 14. 5 K proteins) exist in adenovirus to prevent TNF cytolysis of different cell types, it would appear that TNF is a major antiadenovirus defense of the host...|$|R

40|$|Mood {{disorders}} cause much {{suffering and}} are the single greatest cause of lost productivity worldwide. Although multiple medications, along with behavioral therapies, have proven effective for some individuals, millions of people lack an effective therapeutic option. A common serotonin (5 -HT) transporter (5 -HTT/SERT, SLC 6 A 4) polymorphism is believed to confer lower 5 -HTT expression in vivo and elevates risk for multiple mood disorders including anxiety, alcoholism, and major depression. Importantly, this variant is also associated with reduced responsiveness to selective 5 -HT reuptake inhibitor antidepressants. We hypothesized that a reduced antidepressant response in individuals with a constitutive reduction in 5 -HTT expression could arise because of the compensatory expression of other genes that inactivate 5 -HT in the brain. A functionally upregulated alternate transporter for 5 -HT may prevent extracellular 5 -HT from rising to levels sufficiently high enough to trigger the adaptive neurochemical events necessary for therapeutic benefit. Here we demonstrate that expression of the organic cation transporter type 3 (OCT 3, SLC 22 A 3), which also transports 5 -HT, is upregulated in the brains of mice with constitutively reduced 5 -HTT expression. Moreover, the OCT blocker decynium- 22 diminishes 5 -HT clearance and exerts antidepressant-like effects in these mice but not in WT animals. OCT 3 {{may be an important}} transporter mediating serotonergic signaling when 5 -HTT expression or function is compromised. Nicole L.

It is a severe facial pain typically featured by paroxysmal onset, short persistence, sharp, stabbing or electric shock like in the regions innervated by certain branches of the trigeminal nerve (Headache Classification Committee of the International <b>Headache</b> <b>S</b> 2013). Attacks can be triggered by washing face, speaking, brushing, eating and any contact with certain part of face. Clinically, frontal areas, infraorbital or paranasal areas, mandibular areas and teeth are the mostly affected areas in TN. Here we report a rare case of drug-resistant TN affecting only the upper eyelid. Percutaneous radiofrequency trigeminal neurolysis is an effective, safe, and minimal-invasive treatment for those refractory to drug therapy. However, the sensory innervation of the upper eyelid is complex. After review of the anatomic data and the diagnostic nerve block, we applied neurolysis to infratrochlear, supratrochlear and lacrimal nerves respectively in this case.|$|R

For cluster headache completely refractory to all treatments, surgical modalities and newer interventions such as the implantation of stereotactic electrodes may be useful. Patients should be encouraged to avoid possible triggers such as smoking or alcohol consumption, especially during the cluster period. The intensity of cluster headache pain leads to ethical concerns among researchers over the use of placebo, making randomized controlled trials difficult. As new technology and genetic studies clarify the etiology of cluster headache, it is possible that more specific therapies will emerge. (Am Fam Physician 2005; 71 : 717 - 24, 728.

It {{should be noted that the}} end user of VR and AR (augmented reality) is human. In other words, efforts to make end users as easy, comfortable, mentally and physically burdens as possible should be studied as VR and AR pursue users’ needs (fun, immersion, etc.). For example, a system that poses a threat to safety, as infants and toddlers who have seen Pokémon videos in the 1990 <b>s,</b> which caused <b>headaches,</b> vomiting, and seizures in Japan, are not likely to be socially acceptable. Recently, there have been actively developed products that incorporate images in indoor fitness equipment (bicycles, running machines, etc.) [3]. In many cases, 2 D, 3 D, or HMD (head mounted display)-based VRs are applied to existing mechanical fitness device to increase exercise immersion and eliminate boredom. In this case, due to the image fatigue caused by the VR image, a physical imbalance may be induced after the end of the exercise. Smaller products are more likely to experience image fatigue because they give a stereoscopic effect on a smaller screen than a regular monitor, and image fatigue remains in the body for a certain period of time even after VR stimulation is removed [4]. Most of the related studies have used quantitative image qualities such as flicker fusion frequency tester (EEG) to measure the degree of image fatigue depending on the types of image stimuli (2 D, 3 D, HMD-based VR). Also, research is also being conducted on how visual fatigue, one of image fatigue that is generated by image, is affected by personality. However, research on the effect of VR-applied sports device on physical exercise ones other than mental influences has not been actively conducted yet. Physical education classes using ICT are becoming an alternative to overcome weak physical education facilities and environments. ICT education methods such as internet, various software, and simulation program utilization can provide opportunities for various experiences by overcoming the limit of time and space. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of sports VR training (4 -week aerobic/anaerobic exercise) for body composition, which thus provides theoretically the exercise program for effective health care.|$|R
40|$|Human group C adenoviruses {{cause an}} acute {{infection}} in respiratory epithelia {{and establish a}} long-term or persistent infection, possibly in lymphocytes. The mechanism by which this persistence is maintained is unknown; however, it would require that persistently infected lymphocytes not be deleted. The adenovirus genome encodes proteins that prevent the immune system from eliminating the virus-infected cell, including the E 3 receptor internalization and degradation (RID) complex. The RID complex prevents death of infected cells by blocking apoptosis initiated through death domain-containing receptors of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily, including TNFR 1 (L. R. Gooding, T. S. Ranheim, A. E. Tollefson, L. Aquino, P. Duerksen-Hughes, T. M. <b>Horton,</b> and W. <b>S.</b> Wold, J.

Martinon, J. Tschopp, L. R. Gooding, and C. F. Ware, J. Biol. Chem. 276 : 3270 - 3278, 2001; A. E. Tollefson, K. Toth, K. Doronin, M. Kuppuswamy, O. A. Doronina, D. L. Lichtenstein, T. W.

Here, we test the ability of RID to protect human lymphocytes from apoptosis induced by ligation of Fas, a mechanism important for regulating lymphocyte populations. Using a retrovirus expressing RID to infect six human lymphocyte cell lines, we found that RID functions {{in the absence of}} other viral proteins to downregulate surface Fas on some, but not all, cell lines. Total cellular levels of Fas decrease as measured by Western blotting, and this loss of Fas correlates with protection from apoptosis induced by ligation of Fas in every cell line tested. Although in some cases, RID causes loss of only a fraction of surface Fas, the presence of RID completely blocks the immediate events downstream of Fas ligation (i. e., Fas-FADD association and caspase- 8 cleavage) in susceptible cell lines. Nonetheless, the ability of RID to block Fas signaling is independent of the Fas signaling pathway used (type I or type II). Interestingly, among the four T-cell lines tested, RID caused loss of Fas in the two T-cell lines bearing a relatively immature phenotype, while having no activity in T cells with mature phenotypes. Collectively, these data suggest that RID functions to prevent apoptosis of some human lymphocytes by internalizing surface Fas receptors. It is possible that the expression of RID facilitates long-term infection by preventing Fas-mediated deletion of persistently infected lymphocytes...|$|R
