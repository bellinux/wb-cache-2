5|$|After {{voting in}} favor of the {{resolution}} of independence, Congress turned <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> to the committee's draft of the declaration. Over several days of debate, they made a few changes in wording and deleted nearly a fourth of the text and, on July 4, 1776, the wording of the Declaration of Independence was approved and sent to the printer for publication.|$|E
50|$|Edgar G. Ulmer's Strange Illusion was {{the first}} post-war film to adapt the Hamlet story, {{and was one of}} the {{earliest}} films to focus <b>its</b> <b>attentions</b> on a young character's psychology.|$|R
50|$|After {{their failure}} to break into federal {{parliament}} in 2001, Unity largely shifted <b>its</b> <b>attentions</b> to local government, running a number of candidates for local councils in largely non-white areas, primarily in suburban Sydney. It did not run any candidates in the 2004 federal election.|$|R
50|$|From 1989 to 1993 a {{companion}} series, Screen One, was broadcast {{on the more}} mainstream BBC1. After almost a decade Screen Two {{came to an end}} as the BBC moved <b>its</b> <b>attentions</b> away from expensive single dramas and concentrated production on series and serials instead.|$|R
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the raid, Hitler postponed Operation Sea Lion. Having been defeated in daylight, the Luftwaffe turned <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> to The Blitz night campaign which lasted until May 1941.|$|E
5|$|With an {{increasing}} Third World presence {{and the failure}} of UN mediation in conflicts in the Middle East, Vietnam, and Kashmir, the UN increasingly shifted <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> to its ostensibly secondary goals of economic development and cultural exchange. By the 1970s, the UN budget for social and economic development was far greater than its peacekeeping budget.|$|E
5|$|A new {{publication}} called Classic Rock, featuring Barton {{and many}} of the writers from Kerrang!s first run, championed the NWOBHM revival and continues to focus much of <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> on rock acts from the 1980s. Starting in the 2000s, many reunited bands recorded new albums and revisited their original styles, abandoned {{in the second half of}} the 1980s. Their presence, at metal festivals and on the international rock club circuit, has been constant ever since.|$|E
50|$|During {{the century}} Paris {{was the second}} most {{important}} center of book publishing centers of Europe, after Venice. The University of Paris devoted <b>its</b> <b>attentions</b> largely to fighting the Protestant heresy, the King founded the College of France as a new center of learning independent of the university.|$|R
5000|$|It {{received}} publicity {{from the}} [...] "Get Hasselhoff to Number 1" [...] campaign, which originally campaigned to get [...] "Looking for Freedom" [...] released but later switched <b>its</b> <b>attentions</b> to [...] "Jump in My Car". The song also received backing from BBC Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills and The Sun newspaper.|$|R
50|$|The Germanic tribes, by contrast, {{remained}} {{more isolated}} and fractious. Germany lay {{farther from the}} Roman domain and was well-protected by the strong natural barriers of the Alps, the Rhine and Danube rivers, and the dense forests. Therefore, the expanding Roman Empire turned <b>its</b> <b>attentions</b> to Gaul first, culminating in Julius Caesar's conquest of Gaul in 50 BC.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of the 1973 oil crisis, {{combined}} with the growing influence of Third World alignments such as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the Non-Aligned Movement, less-powerful countries had more room to assert their independence and often showed themselves resistant to pressure from either superpower. Meanwhile, Moscow was forced to turn <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> inward to deal with the Soviet Union's deep-seated domestic economic problems. During this period, Soviet leaders such as Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin embraced the notion of détente.|$|E
5|$|As the {{reactors}} at Hanford came online, the Metallurgical Laboratory turned <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> back to theoretical designs. The discovery of spontaneous fission in reactor-bred plutonium due to contamination by plutonium-240 led Wigner to propose switching to breeding uranium-233 from thorium, but {{the challenge was}} met by the Los Alamos Laboratory developing an implosion-type nuclear weapon design. Wigner was also intrigued {{by the possibility of}} doing away with much of the complexities of a reactor by having the uranium in solution or a slurry in heavy water. The Metallurgical Laboratory attempted to find a way of doing this.|$|E
5|$|Before {{developing}} the route west of Aspen, the state turned <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> the other way. In 1927 it rebuilt the old stage road over Independence Pass to Twin Lakes and designated {{it part of}} Highway 82, closing it in winters to avoid the maintenance costs. Most of it followed the original route; however in some places it deviated. The largest section of the original remains three miles (5km) below the pass on the east approach. The foundation of the gatekeeper's house remains, {{as well as some}} of the original toll gate.|$|E

2500|$|The club {{continued}} {{as a junior}} team during the 13-year-long [...] "flim flam years", playing in the local Saturday morning league, and sought re-admission to the Irish League. Each time, the club nominated the Brandywell as its chosen home ground but the Irish League refused re-admission. Suspecting refusal was driven by sectarianism, and believing it would never gain re-admission, Derry turned <b>its</b> <b>attentions</b> elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} 1860s, Henry Richard became a leading {{figure in the}} Liberation Society, whose main aim was the disestablishment of the Anglican Church. The Society {{increasingly}} focused <b>its</b> <b>attentions</b> on Richard's native Wales and sought to contest parliamentary elections. At the 1865 General Election 1865, Richard announced his intention to contest Cardiganshire but withdrew {{in view of the}} opposition of the Liberal elite in the county.|$|R
5|$|Frustrated {{by their}} defeats in the judiciary, the Relief Party turned <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> to the gubernatorial {{election}} of 1824, where they backed General Joseph Desha. Desha's election by the overwhelming vote of 38,37822,499 {{was seen by}} the party as a mandate to pursue the relief agenda. An early proposal to reduce the salaries of the Court of Appeals justices to 25 cents per year was discarded without a vote, but the House of Representatives mustered the votes to remove the offending justices. The justices were spared removal when the Senate failed to pass the measure with a two-thirds majority. The vote was 2312.|$|E
5|$|In early May, the HV {{launched}} a successful offensive, codenamed Operation Flash, against a RSK-held part of western Slavonia in Croatia. The move caused the VRS to reorient <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> to the Orašje pocket, the only territory outside its control between the Derventa–Brčko {{road and the}} Sava River. The shift of VRS focus to Orašje {{may have been the}} result of a desire to retaliate for the defeat suffered by the RSK in western Slavonia, or meant as a quick land-grab before a peace settlement was accepted.|$|E
5|$|Just as Julie and Keys {{celebrate}} their victory, the dog, without warning, turns <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> to Carruthers and brutally attacks him. The dog {{had not previously}} shown any aggression towards him--no explanation for this is given, but implications go that the dog's programming has somehow been reversed, though that was never Keys's intention, or that Carruthers has a similarity to the dog's original owner whom the dog hates now. To save his employer's life, Keys is forced to shoot and kill the dog, and the film ends {{with the image of}} the dog's body lying {{in the center of the}} training enclosure while Julie weeps over his dead body.|$|E

50|$|The {{paper was}} noted for <b>its</b> <b>attentions</b> to the {{activities}} of the powerful and wealthy, its interest in foreign affairs, and in literary and artistic events. It began regular printing of notices of plays, concerts, and operas in the early 20th century, and {{is said to have been}} the first daily paper in London to do this. Arthur Hervey (1855-1922) was the paper's music critic between 1892 and 1908.|$|R
5|$|Later {{that year}} he was {{assigned}} to the Manhattan Project, and moved with his family to Los Alamos, New Mexico. There he joined the Los Alamos Laboratory's Ordnance (O) Division, which was under the command of another Naval officer, Captain William S. Parsons. Initially the goal of the O Division was to design a gun-type nuclear weapon known as Thin Man. This proved to be impractical due to contamination of the reactor-bred plutonium with plutonium-240, and in February 1944, the Division switched <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> {{to the development of the}} Little Boy, a smaller device using uranium-235. Birch used unenriched uranium to create scale models and later full-scale mock-ups of the device.|$|E
5|$|Many readers {{praised the}} series for <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> to detail and realism {{in the area}} of {{military}} tactics and procedures. Much of this was due to Hama's military experience (he was drafted into the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during the Vietnam war), but he also did a large amount of research in order to be as up-to-date as possible. He frequented Sky Books, a military-oriented bookstore in New York, and read many U.S. Army field manuals and technical manuals, and also credits his friend Lee Russel, a military historian, for helping him with research.|$|E
5|$|Once air-to-air combat began over North Vietnam, the Air Force {{was again}} found lacking. The {{mainstay}} missiles {{of the air}} war {{turned out to be}} the Navy-developed AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow, not its own AIM-4 Falcon. The Air Force continuously opposed adapting to the war in Southeast Asia, since its leadership believed that it was an aberration that would be quickly resolved. It could then turn <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> (and its more modern weapons) against the greater threat posed by the Soviet Union. None in the Air Force high command foresaw that the war would drag on for nearly a decade.|$|E
5000|$|The Clipper {{nameplate}} {{was dropped}} for 1948 as Packard issued its Twenty-Second Series automobiles, which, while proclaimed {{by the company}} as [...] "all-new," [...] were actually restyled Clippers. Only the 1941-47 Clipper's roof and trunk lid survived. At this time, Packard's president, George Christopher, insisted upon concentrating on sales of the company's lower-priced cars, while longtime competitor Cadillac focused <b>its</b> <b>attentions</b> on {{the upper end of}} the market.|$|R
50|$|After the Third War, the Legion {{tried to}} destroy the Frozen Throne and kill Ner'zhul to {{eliminate}} the Scourge threat due to the Lich King's defection from the Legion. After the failure of Illidan Stormrage to defeat the Lich King in The Frozen Throne, Illidan returned to Outland and no longer serves the Legion. The Legion then turned <b>its</b> <b>attentions</b> to Kael'thas Sunstrider, who attempted to summon Kil'jaeden into Azeroth through the Sunwell but failed.|$|R
50|$|In 2000 {{the company}} {{changed its name}} to Circadence and turned <b>its</b> <b>attentions</b> to {{software}} that could speed up website performance, though it maintained an entertainment division that kept the name VR-1. Circadence sold off the division to Pacific Century CyberWorks Japan Co in February 2001 for a 5.3% stake in Pacific Century CyberWorks. Circadence also received an investment from a pool of investors to transition the company to alter its focus to WAN Optimization.|$|R
5|$|The Battle of Dinwiddie Court House {{occurred}} on March 31, {{and is considered}} a Confederate victory. The same Union force that was driven back earlier was again sent toward Five Forks. The remaining portion of Crook's 2nd Division met the Confederates further west at Chamberlain's Creek. During this time, infantry {{under the command of}} Union General Gouverneur Kemble Warren, located east of Sheridan's army, was driven back. The attacking Confederate force then turned <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> to Sheridan—Sheridan's cavalry had to face two enemy infantry divisions and a cavalry.|$|E
5|$|The Hammond organ {{has also}} been {{emulated}} in software. The most prominent emulator in this field has been the Native Instruments B4 series, which has been praised for <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> to detail and choice of features. Emagic (now part of Apple) has also produced a software emulation, the EVB3. This {{has led to a}} Hammond organ module with all controls and features of the original instrument in the Logic Pro audio production suite.|$|E
5|$|The Whitestone Branch {{would have}} had to be rebuilt if it were leased to the subway, with {{railroad}} crossings removed and the single track doubled. The PSC located 14 places where crossings needed to be eliminated. However, by early 1917, there was barely enough money to build the subway to Flushing, let alone a link to Whitestone and Bayside. A lease agreement was announced on October 16, 1917, but the IRT withdrew from the agreement a month later, citing that it was inappropriate to enter such an agreement at that time. Thereafter, the PSC instead turned <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> back to the Main Street subway extension.|$|E
