5|$|To {{some extent}} {{this is due}} to {{geography}} and driver training, but more rigorous impaired driving enforcement and severe penalties in Sweden for driving under the influence may also explain the difference. While it might be argued that highways and vehicles in Sweden are different from those in the United States, the U.S. fatality rate is also about double the rate in the Canadian province of Ontario, which experienced 3.6 road fatalities per 1 billion vehicle-km according to preliminary 2014 data. Ontario, which is a vast province of more than 1 million square kilometers, has a similar mix of highway types including congested urban and rural highways. Ontario also has a similar mix of large transport trucks essentially identical to U.S. transport trucks, full-sized pickup trucks, SUVs and passenger cars, although there may be more small cars driven in Ontario compared to the United States. This suggests that differences in fatality rates are due to non-physical factors such as <b>driver</b> <b>behavior.</b>|$|E

Insufficient data may lead to inaccurate models while excessive data waste resources. For projects that cost millions of dollars, {{it is critical to}} determine the right amount of data needed.

A general assessment method is proposed using a Gaussian kernel density estimation to catch the underlying characteristics of <b>driver</b> <b>behaviors.</b> We then apply the Kullback-Liebler divergence method to measure the similarity between density functions with differing amounts of NDD. A max-minimum approach is used to compute the appropriate amount of NDD. To validate our proposed method, we investigated the car-following case using NDD collected from the University of Michigan Safety Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD) program. We demonstrate that from a statistical perspective, the proposed approach can provide an appropriate amount of NDD capable of capturing most features of the normal car-following behavior, which is consistent with the experiment settings in many literatures...|$|R

The method is successfully validated using the collected data from the experiments that are conducted on a driving simulator. Furthermore, two simple methods based on the static parameters such as the Time-To-Collision and the Required Deceleration Parameter are also applied to our problem and are compared to the proposed method.
