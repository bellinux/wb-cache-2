60|$|But {{that is only}} a {{preliminary}} statement; it still leaves untouched all the considerations advanced in the former part of this discussion to show how easily the complications and difficulties of voting lead to a falsification of the popular will and understanding. But here we enter a region where a really scientific investigation has been made, and where established results are available. A method of election was worked out by Hare {{in the middle of}} the last century that really does seem to avoid or mitigate nearly every falsifying or debilitating possibility in elections; it was enthusiastically supported by J.S. Mill; it is now advocated by a special society--the Proportional Representation Society--to which belong men of the most <b>diverse</b> <b>type</b> of distinction, united only by the common desire to see representative government a reality and not a disastrous sham. It is a method which does render impossible nearly every way of forcing candidates upon constituencies, and nearly every trick for rigging results that now distorts and cripples the political life of the modern world. It exacts only one condition, a difficult but not an impossible condition, and that is the honest scrutiny and counting of the votes.|$|E

50|$|The {{development}} of facile chemical glycosylation protocols {{is essential to}} synthesizing complex oligosaccharides. Among many <b>diverse</b> <b>type</b> of glycosidic linkages, the 1,2-cis-β-glycoside, which exists in many biologically relevant glycoconjugates and oligosaccharides, is arguably {{one of the most}} difficult to synthesize. The challenges in constructing β-mannose linkage have been well documented in several reviews. To date, a few laboratories have devised efficient methodologies to overcome these synthetic hurdles, and achieved varying degrees of success. Of those elegant approaches, a highly stereoselective β-mannosylation protocol developed by Crich and co-workers was realized as a breakthrough in β-mannoside synthesis. This strategy is based on the initial activation of α-mannosyl sulfoxides 1 with triflic anhydride (Tf2O) using DTBMP (2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyridine) as a base, followed by nucleophilic substitution of glycosyl acceptors (HOR3) to provide the 1,2-cis-β-glycoside 2 in good yield and selectivity (Scheme 1).|$|E

40|$|This review {{covers the}} {{functionally}} <b>diverse</b> <b>type</b> III polyketide synthase (PKS) superfamily {{of plant and}} bacterial biosynthetic enzymes, from the discovery of chalcone synthase (CHS) in the 1970 s {{through the end of}} 2001. A broader perspective is achieved by a comparison of these CHS-like enzymes to mechanistically and evolutionarily related families of enzymes, including the type I and type II PKSs, as well as the thiolases and β-ketoacyl synthases of fatty acid metabolism. As CHS is both the most frequently occurring and best studied type III PKS, this enzyme’s structure and mechanism is examined in detail. The in vivo functions and biological activities of several classes of plant natural products derived from chalcones are also discussed. Evolutionary mechanisms of type III PKS divergence are considered, as are the biological functions and activities of each of the known and functionally divergent type III PKS enzyme families (currently twelve in plants and three in bacteria). A major focus of this review is the integration of information from genetic and biochemical studies with the unique insights gained from protein X-ray crystallography and homology modeling. This structural approach has generated a number of new predictions regarding both the importance and mechanistic role of various amino acid substitutions observed among functionally <b>diverse</b> <b>type</b> III PKS enzymes. 1 Introduction an...|$|E

With the results obtained, it has been possible to shed light on important aspects of the catalytic cycle of VHPO. Furthermore, a number of synthetic aspects of the reactivity of the various vanadium peroxocomplexes is reviewed...|$|E
