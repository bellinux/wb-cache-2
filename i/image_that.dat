Each frame had been taken using a different color filter: blue, green and violet, with exposure times of 0.72, 0.48 and 0.72 seconds respectively. The three frames were then recombined to produce the <b>image</b> <b>that</b> became Pale Blue Dot.|$|E

5|$|After {{finishing}} last in 1966–67, the Bruins {{qualified for}} the 1968 playoffs, their first appearance in the playoffs since the 1958–59 season. In the pre-season, the Bruins added Phil Esposito, Fred Stanfield and Ken Hodge from the Chicago Black Hawks {{in one of the}} most famous deals ever. The Bruins also added rookies Glen Sather and Derek Sanderson, developing a more aggressive <b>image</b> <b>that</b> led to the nickname of the 'Big Bad Bruins.' The Bruins, happy to make the playoffs, were swept by eventual champion Montreal in the first round.|$|E
5|$|Caracalla is {{presented}} in ancient sources as a tyrant and cruel leader, an <b>image</b> <b>that</b> has survived into modernity. Dio Cassius and Herodian present Caracalla as a soldier first and emperor second. In the 12th century, Geoffrey of Monmouth started the legend of Caracalla's role as the king of Britain. Later, in the 18th century, Caracalla's memory was revived {{in the works of}} French artists due to the parallels between Caracalla's apparent tyranny and that of King Louis XVI. Modern works continue to portray Caracalla as a psychopathic and evil ruler. His rule is remembered as being one of the most tyrannical of all Roman emperors.|$|E
5|$|Enlightenment {{philosophy}} {{had developed}} Western Europeans’ interest in Greece, or rather in an idealised Ancient Greece, {{the linchpin of}} Antiquity, as it was perceived and taught. The Enlightenment philosophers, for whom the notions of Nature and Reason were so important, believed that these had been the fundamental values of Classical Athens. The Ancient Greek democracies, and above all Athens, became models to emulate. There they searched for answers to the political and philosophical problems of their time. Works {{such as those of}} Abbé Barthélemy, Voyage du Jeune Anacharsis (1788), served to fix definitively the <b>image</b> <b>that</b> Europe had of the Aegean.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, the 25 {{personnel}} of the Comité {{joined the}} CIA officers in sorting and processing the seized documents. The CIA officers had a separate side {{entrance to the}} building in which the operations took place, {{in order to maintain}} the <b>image</b> <b>that</b> the operation was a Guatemalan internal affair. The task of sorting through the papers proved to be daunting: by September, the main index of the material contained 15,800 cards. All hand-written material was preserved, and multiple copies of printed material were kept. Every document had to be reproduced, because the original copies of every document was to remain in Guatemala. Approximately half of the paper that had been gathered was incinerated. The CIA gave the highest priority to the documents seized from the PGT.|$|E
5|$|Lochner's {{major works}} include three large polyptychs: the Dombild Altarpiece; the Last Judgement, which is broken apart {{and in several}} collections; and Nuremberg's Crucifixion. Only two {{attributed}} paintings are dated; the 1445 Nativity now in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich, and the Presentation in the Temple from 1447, now in Darmstadt. There is a smaller, earlier version of the presentation scene at the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Lisbon, dated 1445. As secular works grew in demand and religious works became unfashionable in later centuries, 15th-century polyptychs were often broken up and sold as individual works, especially if a panel or section contained an <b>image</b> <b>that</b> could pass as a secular portrait.|$|E
5|$|Tennyson is not {{the only}} one that uses the image; John Everett Millais's {{painting}} Mariana is based on Tennyson's version of Mariana, and lines 9 through 12 of Tennyson's poem were used for the catalogue description of the painting. Similarly, Millais's version served as the inspiration for Elizabeth Gaskell's novel, Mariana. Tennyson's Mariana and Gaskell's main character, Ruth, are sensitive to the sounds around them and are constantly looking out of their window in <b>image</b> <b>that</b> represents their imprisonment within their homes. The image of Mariana used by Tennyson and the later works are equally of a woman who is weary.|$|E

50|$|Deleuze’s {{cinematic}} taxonomy {{emerges from}} the philosophy of Henri Bergson in Matter and Memory (1896). Bergson’s thesis is that of an enmeshed human body {{in the world of}} matter where perceptions cause affections and where affections cause actions. Deleuze sees a correspondence between Bergson’s tripartite formulation and the cinematic medium. There are thus three types of cinematic movement-images: perception <b>images</b> (<b>that</b> focus on what is seen), affection <b>images</b> (<b>that</b> focus on expressions of feeling) and action <b>images</b> (<b>that</b> focus on the duration of action). These three images are associated, respectively, with long shots, close-ups and medium shots.|$|R
5|$|Throughout the poems, the end {{becomes the}} {{beginning}} and things constantly repeat. This use of circular time {{is similar to the}} way Dante uses time in his Divine Comedy – Little Gidding ends with a rose garden <b>image</b> <b>that</b> {{is the same as the}} garden beginning Burnt Norton. The repetition of time affects memory and how one can travel through their own past to find permanency and the divine. Memory within the poem is similar to how St. Augustine discussed it, in that memory allows one to understand words and life. The only way to discover eternity is through memory, understanding the past, and transcending beyond time. Likewise, in the Augustinian view that Eliot shares, timeless words are connected to Christ as the Logos and how Christ calls upon mankind to join him in salvation.|$|E
5|$|At the 2009 TGS event, it was {{revealed}} that Hope's silver hair was meant for Lightning, but when her hair color was decided as pink, Hope received the silver hair coloring instead. Hope's Academy uniform for XIII-2 was designed by Hideo Minaba. While he was portrayed as sensitive and vulnerable in XIII, for XIII-2, the game's director wished to portray Hope as a more mature, authoritative person. According to Toriyama, how Hope matured, as seen through Lightning's eyes, formed one of the main story themes for Lightning Returns. He was originally going to have a third unique design for the game, but the team eventually decided to settle on his original teenage appearance. In a later interview, he said that while the character was much liked by the team, he felt that Hope lacked the heroic <b>image</b> <b>that</b> could make him a leading character. Watanabe later said that he felt Hope helped complete Lightning's character and enable her to grow as a person. Hope is voiced by Vincent Martella in English and Yūki Kaji in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Gumball is a 1983 {{video game}} by Robert Cook and Broderbund {{in which the}} player {{controls}} the valves of a maze-like machine to sort gumballs by their color. The player meets the quota of each level to earn their character—a factory worker—a promotion, resulting in a raise in difficulty with more color choices and defective gumballs to exclude. Broderbund co-founder Doug Carlston conceived of the game's machine-sorting concept, and Cook, the designer, added the gumball conceit and built the core gameplay within a week. He later returned to add sound, decorative features, and a secret <b>image</b> <b>that</b> was only found three decades after the game's release. Gumball debuted at the June 1983 Consumer Electronics Show and released for the Apple II, Atari 8-bit family, and Commodore 64. Reviewers separately noted {{the difficulty of the}} game's later stages, praised its comical elements, and commented on the social role of simulating mundane work. The game did not become popular and its copies became rare.|$|E

5|$|Heavy metal is {{characterized}} by aggressive, driving rhythms, amplified and distorted guitars, grandiose lyrics, and virtuosic instrumentation. Heavy metal's origins lie in the hard rock bands who took blues and rock and created a heavy sound built on guitar and drums. Most of the pioneers in the field were British; the first major American bands came in the early 1970s, like Blue Öyster Cult, KISS, and Aerosmith. Heavy metal remained, however, a largely underground phenomenon. During the 1980s the first major pop-metal style arose and dominated the charts for several years kicked off by metal act Quiet Riot and dominated by bands such as Mötley Crüe and Ratt; this was glam metal, a hard rock and pop fusion with a raucous spirit and a glam-influenced visual aesthetic. Some of these bands, like Bon Jovi, became international stars. The band Guns N' Roses rose to fame {{near the end of}} the decade with an <b>image</b> <b>that</b> was a reaction against the glam metal aesthetic.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} renewal, Eliot {{believed}} that suffering {{was needed for}} all of society before new life could begin. The original Little Gidding community was built for living on monastic lines, but the community was damaged and dispersed by Puritan forces during the English Civil War in 1646. The church, {{the centre of the}} community, was restored in 1714 and again in 1853. The image of religious renewal is combined with the image of the London air-raids and the constant fighting and destruction within the world. This compound image is used to discuss the connection of holy places with the Holy Spirit, Pentecost, communion with the dead, and the repetition of history. The theme is also internal to Eliot's own poems; the image of the rose garden at the end Little Gidding is the <b>image</b> <b>that</b> begins Burnt Norton and the journey is made circular. Also, the depiction of time within the poem is similar to the way time operates within The Family Reunion.|$|E
5|$|Johansson {{has criticized}} {{the media for}} {{promoting}} an <b>image</b> <b>that</b> causes unhealthy diets and eating disorders among women, believing that being skinny is not attractive. In one article she wrote for HuffPost, Johansson encouraged the reader to maintain a healthy body. She appeared nude {{on the cover of}} the March 2006 issue of Vanity Fair alongside actress Keira Knightley and fully clothed fashion designer Tom Ford. This caused some controversy as it was believed the photo demonstrated that women are forced to flaunt their sexuality more often than men. In September 2011, nude photographs of Johansson hacked from her cell phone were published online. Following an FBI investigation, the perpetrator was arrested, pled guilty, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Johansson said the photos had been sent to her then-husband, Reynolds, three years before the incident. In 2014, Johansson won a lawsuit against French publisher, JC Lattès, for using her name and featuring a look-alike model of her in the novel The First Thing We Look At by Gregoire Delacourt. Johansson was awarded $3,400, a fraction of the $68,000 she had claimed.|$|E

5|$|On October 17, 2010, Kanye West {{revealed}} through Twitter that My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy {{had been}} rejected by certain stores because of the cover art. The artwork (a portrait by George Condo) shows West being straddled by an armless winged female (a phoenix). Both characters are depicted nude, and one nipple of the phoenix's breasts and her buttocks are visible. The artist later said that Kanye wanted a cover <b>image</b> <b>that</b> would be banned. The painting is centered with a thin yellow border on a red background. The artwork follows along the apparent theme of the album, as well as West's music film Runaway. This {{is one of five}} covers; all of them were included with its purchase. A second cover, with a painting of a ballerina by Condo, was posted on the Amazon.com pre-order page. It was intended to be the original artwork for Runaway, but West used a photograph of a ballerina instead.|$|E
5|$|Pastoral care is {{provided}} {{through the house}} system. Each pupil is assigned to a house. Each house has its own accommodation {{in the school and}} its own set of tutors to look after members of the house. There are eight vertically integrated houses in total, each with its own colour and heraldic-like shield: The two boys' boarding houses are York (red) and Northumberland (pale blue). The three day boys' houses are Tees (dark green) and Dale (burgundy), both formed by splitting Teesdale House, the first day boys' house, and finally Durham (gold), which was converted from boarding to day when the school expanded in the 1990s. The boarding girls belong to the original Sixth Form girls' house, Longfield (dark pink), and the new houses formed for day girls when the school became co-educational are Marwood (purple) and more recently Bowes (pale green). The school considered abolishing its boarding facilities when, like many boarding schools, it suffered a significant drop in numbers during the 1990s. However, numbers unexpectedly improved {{around the turn of the}} millennium, and this turnaround has often been attributed to the positive <b>image</b> <b>that</b> boarding received from the Harry Potter series. The school is interdenominational, whilst maintaining its foundation in Christian principles and values.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, {{the agents}} again meet with Dr. Theresa Shannon, and she further {{discusses}} the spree of murders that occurred ten years ago. According to Shannon, five {{people were killed}} at the clinic: four patients and a cosmetic doctor named Clifford Cox, who ostensibly died of a drug overdose. Following his intuition, Mulder discovers that the birthdays of the four patients also match up with the dates of the Witches' Sabbath but that Dr. Clifford Cox's birthday does not. Mulder then uses the hospital's computer program to determine what Franklin would look like had he undergone heavy plastic surgery. The computer produces an <b>image</b> <b>that</b> looks like Franklin, suggesting that he is actually Dr. Clifford Cox in disguise. When Dr. Shannon discovers Cox alone in a blood-spattered operating room, he uses uses witchcraft to magically teleport surgical tools into her intestines, which causes her to bleed internally. Luckily, Dr. Shannon is rushed into surgery and survives. Cox, however, escapes; he is later seen removing {{the skin of his}} face and performing a ritual to make him appear younger. It is revealed that Cox murders in a quest to gain eternal youth. The episode ends with a now-young Cox successfully applying for a position at another medical hospital.|$|E
