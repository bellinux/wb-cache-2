40|$|OBJECTIVE: There is no {{information}} on the duration of absence of depressed Dutch workers. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the duration of sickness absence due to depressive symptoms in the working population. METHODS: In this observational study of 15 % of the Dutch working population, all absence episodes (n = 9, 910) starting between April 2002 and November 2005 diagnosed as depression were selected. For these episodes, Kaplan-Meier survival curves were computed. RESULTS: The mean (and median) duration of sickness absence due to depressive symptoms was 200 (179) <b>days</b> <b>in</b> men <b>and</b> 213 (201) <b>days</b> <b>in</b> women. In both sexes, older employees had longer absence durations. Depressive symptoms had an estimated rate of chronicity (1 year of absence) of 24 %. Employees <b>in</b> educational <b>and</b> public services (232 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> men <b>and</b> 242 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> women), commercial services (213 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> men <b>and</b> 219 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> women) <b>and</b> health care (212 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> men <b>and</b> 214 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> women) had the longest mean duration of absence with depressive symptoms. Men in the industrial sector (189 days) had the shortest absence periods. Employees in large sized companies (188 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> men <b>and</b> 208 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> women) had shorter absence episodes as compared to companies with less than 75 employees (214 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> men <b>and</b> 226 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> women). CONCLUSIONS: Workers with depressive symptoms were absent for a long time. Explanations for the long duration are discussed.

40|$|Background: Early {{diagnosis}} of tuberculosis (TB) {{is a major}} key for effective TB program. Evaluation of delay in {{diagnosis of}} smear positive TB is needed to evaluation of TB program situation in each country. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate of diagnosis delay in smear positive tuberculosis patients in Islamic Republic of Iran. Materials <b>And</b> Methods: <b>In</b> this cross sectional study, all smear positive TB registered patients from 20 March 2009 to 20 March 2010 in Iran were assessed. Diagnosis delay is defined as the time interval between the first presentations of TB symptoms to the TB confirmation. Mann-Whitney test, chi-square and logistic regression was used to analysis. Results: Diagnosis delay was 58 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> female <b>and</b> 53 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> male (P= 0. 004), 61 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> non-Iranian <b>and</b> 54 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> Iranian (P< 0. 001), 59 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> urban <b>and</b> 50 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> rural (P< 0. 001), 57 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> non-prisoner <b>and</b> 37 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> prisoner (P< 0. 001), 61 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> patients who chose private outpatients system <b>and</b> 52 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> patients who chose Public health outpatients system (P< 0. 001). 193 (9. 4 %) had 1 - 9 bacilli and 2132 (37. 4 %) were 3 + in sputum smear examination.
