5|$|After Hardorff's death, {{the main}} proponent of Classicism was Christian Frederik Hansen who {{developed}} a more severe style with clean, simple forms and large, unbroken surfaces. From 1800, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of all major building projects in Copenhagen where he designed the Copenhagen City Hall & Courthouse (1805–15) on Nytorv.

During his time there, Verville {{served in the}} {{following}} roles: aeronautical engineer; chief of the Manufacturing, Engineering, and Inspections Service; and finally assistant chief of the Aeronautic Development Section. In his role as chief of the Manufacturing, Engineering, and Inspections Service, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of the reviews for issuing type certificates for all manufactured airplanes.|$|E
5|$|After Indonesia's {{independence}} on 17 August 1945, Rijadi led Indonesian {{forces in}} the Surakarta area during the revolution against the returning Dutch. Starting with a guerrilla campaign, by 1947, when he fought against Dutch offensives in Ambarawa and Semarang, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of the 26th Regiment. During a second Dutch offensive, Rijadi {{lost control of the}} city but soon retook it, later leading counter-offensives in West Java. In 1950, {{after the end of the}} revolution, Rijadi was sent to the Moluccas to put down a rebellion. After several months of planning and a month crossing Ambon Island, Rijadi was killed near the end of the operation by a rebounding bullet.|$|E

5|$|After the Japanese surrender, the Dutch {{attempted}} to re-occupy the newly declared Republic of Indonesia; unwilling to be colonised, the Indonesians fought back. Rijadi began a guerrilla campaign against Dutch posts and quickly {{rose through the}} ranks. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of the 26th Regiment in Surakarta. During Operation Product, a general offensive by Dutch forces in mid-1947, Rijadi led Indonesian forces in several parts of Central Java, including Ambarawa and Semarang; he also led a cleansing force between mounts Merapi and Merbabu.|$|E
5|$|He {{began writing}} several {{documents}} that strongly criticized the colonial government {{and wrote a}} report listing the elements that he felt were {{being used by the}} administration that were affecting the island's social and economic aspects. In January 1867, Baldorioty de Castro received a communication from Puerto Rico's Superior Instruction Juncture, notifying him that he was selected {{as a member of the}} Test Commission, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of monitoring tests being issued in physics and the natural sciences.|$|E
5|$|In 1291, he {{came under}} Tatar {{suzerainty}} and in 1292 <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of an unsuccessful campaign against neighbouring Serbia. Even though the Serbs captured Vidin in their counter-offensive, perhaps thanks to Tatar influence Shishman was placed once {{more as the}} ruler of the region, this time as a Serbian vassal. However, he continued to rule his lands largely independently. As his son and successor as despot of Vidin Michael Shishman acceded to the Bulgarian throne in 1323, Shishman was the progenitor of the last medieval Bulgarian royal dynasty, the Shishman dynasty.|$|E

5|$|In July 2000, McCall {{accepted}} his first coaching role, {{when he was}} appointed assistant manager to Chris Hutchings at Bradford City, after Hutchings was promoted from the role to replace Paul Jewell as City manager. Just four months later, Hutchings was sacked, and McCall was appointed as caretaker-player manager. His first game in the role was against his former team Everton, who were led by his former manager Walter Smith, but ended with a 1–0 defeat. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> for one more game, which also ended in defeat, until Jim Jefferies was appointed the new manager. Jefferies brought with him his own assistant Billy Brown, and McCall was appointed first-team coach.|$|E
5|$|Ivan the Russian {{rose to a}} high rank in the Bulgarian {{military}} {{in the wake of}} the accession of Michael Shishman to the throne. In 1323, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of the Bulgarian defence of Plovdiv during the prolonged and ultimately successful Byzantine siege of the city. In 1328, he was involved in a failed Bulgarian attempt to capture the Byzantine capital Constantinople from within. Probably taking part in the turbulent events that surrounded and followed Michael Shishman's death, Ivan the Russian was last mentioned as a representative of Ivan Alexander in 1332.|$|E

In June 1920, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of ten fellow Victoria Cross recipients when they {{were introduced to the}} Prince of Wales at Government House, during the latter's visit to Australia. Wark became a respected member of Australian society, holding several honorary public positions, including director of the Royal North Shore Hospital, life governor of the New South Wales Benevolent Society, and a councillor of the National Roads and Motorists' Association of New South Wales.

5|$|Oskar Gröning (sometimes transliterated as Oscar Groening in English; born 10 June 1921) is a German former SS junior squad {{leader who}} was {{stationed}} at Auschwitz concentration camp. His responsibilities included counting and sorting the money taken from prisoners, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> {{of the personal}} property prisoners had arrived with. On a few occasions he witnessed the procedures of mass-killing in the camp. After being transferred from Auschwitz to a combat unit in October 1944, Gröning was captured by the British on 10 June 1945 when his unit surrendered. He was eventually transferred to Britain as {{a prisoner of war}} and worked as a forced labourer.|$|E
5|$|Uanna {{also looked}} after {{security}} at other bases {{that might be}} used by the 509th in an emergency, such as Iwo Jima. He supervised the loading of the Little Boy bomb into the Enola Gay, and during the bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of a communications center on Iwo Jima that relayed messages back to Tinian. He was therefore {{one of the first people}} to know that Hiroshima was the target, and that it had been attacked. After the subsequent unconditional surrender of Japan, he accompanied the Manhattan Project team sent to survey the damage, spending four weeks in Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, in 1808, he {{was offered}} the {{position}} of First Squire of the Emperor in Napoleon's Military Household, a dignity that offered an annual revenue of 30,000 Francs and which gained importance when the Grand Squire, General Armand Augustin Louis de Caulaincourt, was sent to Saint-Petersburg as ambassador. Napoleon allegedly chose Nansouty for his elegant manners and education, aristocratic posture and talent for administration. In his capacity as First Squire, Nansouty thus had to accompany the Emperor during the latter's short campaign in Spain (from November 1808 to early January 1809). There, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of several administrative tasks linked with managing the Emperor's stable services and suite and commanding his orderly officers. The Emperor's aides-de-camp had their own aides-de-camp, who were also placed {{under the command of}} the First Squire. Although never very far away from the Emperor in a campaign that included many battles, Nansouty himself never exercised a field command during this campaign, and in January 1809, he accompanied his master back to France, as the outbreak of the War of the Fifth Coalition was imminent.|$|E

5|$|At {{the urging}} of Butler's father, in 1924, the newly elected mayor of Philadelphia W. Freeland Kendrick asked {{him to leave the}} Marines to become the Director of Public Safety, the {{official}} in charge of running the city's police and fire departments. Philadelphia's municipal government was notoriously corrupt and Butler initially refused. Kendrick asked President Calvin Coolidge to intervene. Coolidge contacted Butler and authorized him to take the necessary leave from the Corps. At the request of the president, Butler served in the post from January 1924 until December 1925. He began his new job by assembling all 4,000 of the city police into the Metropolitan Opera House in shifts to introduce himself and inform them that things would change while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge.</b> He replaced corrupt police officers and, in some cases, switched entire units from one part of the city to another, undermining local protection rackets and profiteering.|$|E
5|$|Billy Bonds is {{the only}} manager to have managed both clubs. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of West Ham from February 1990 to August 1994, {{managing}} the club for 227 games as the team yo-yoed between the First and Second divisions. He guided them to two promotions and one relegation. He resigned in August 1994. He was appointed as Millwall manager in May 1997 by chairman Theo Paphitis— an unpopular decision with many Lions fans due to his West Ham allegiance. Bonds, from south London, had several family members who were Millwall fans; a fact which meant some supporters felt he {{should be given a}} chance. After a good start, the team narrowly avoided relegation, finishing 18th in the Second Division. Bonds was sacked in May 1998, having been in charge of the side for only 53 games.|$|E
5|$|Cresswell {{returned}} to York as a commercial, academy {{and community development}} consultant in April 2014, having previously intended {{to pursue a career}} in coaching. He took on the position of Head of Football Operations, before being appointed as first-team coach to manager Russ Wilcox in March 2015. In May 2015, Cresswell resumed his role as Head of Football Operations, while continuing to coach the first team. He took over as caretaker manager on 26 October 2015 after Wilcox's sacking, and was assisted by youth team coach Jonathan Greening and goalkeeping coach Andy Leaning. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> for the 1–0 away defeat to Crawley Town on 31 October 2015, before ceasing his caretaker duties upon the appointment of Jackie McNamara as manager on 4 November. Cresswell left York by mutual consent on 16 December 2015.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the First World War, Jeffries was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Citizens Military Force on 22 August 1914. By this time <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of the survey department at the Abermain Collieries, but was mobilised for home defence duties and the instruction of volunteers for the newly raised Australian Imperial Force at Newcastle and Liverpool camps. Promoted lieutenant in the Citizens Military Force in July 1915, he transferred to the Australian Imperial Force on 1 February 1916 with the substantive rank of second lieutenant, and was placed in command of C Company of the 34th Battalion. In May, the battalion embarked from Sydney for the United Kingdom, with Jeffries aboard HMAT Hororata. Arriving in late June, the battalion spent the next five months training in England, during which time Jeffries was promoted to lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|For {{the open}} office of {{district}} attorney, vacated by Dilworth {{when he ran}} for mayor, the Democrats nominated city councilman Victor H. Blanc against the Republicans' Wilhelm F. Knauer. Blanc, a veteran of both World Wars and former assistant district attorney, had been elected to city council in an at-large seat in 1951. During his time on the council, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of an investigation into corruption in construction at Philadelphia International Airport. Knauer, a state deputy attorney general, was a long-time Republican party leader. His wife, Virginia Knauer, would later be elected to city council. As in the mayor's race, the Democrats were victorious, and Blanc was elected. His vote totals led the Democratic ticket, exceeding even Dilworth's numbers.|$|E
5|$|Henry D. Smyth was a {{professor}} of physics {{and chairman of the}} physics department of Princeton University from 1935 to 1949. During World War II, he was involved in the Manhattan Project from early 1941, initially {{as a member of the}} National Defense Research Committee’s Committee on Uranium, and later as an associate director of the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. In late 1943, the President of Princeton University, Harold W. Dodds, began insisting that Smyth work part-time at Princeton, where there was a shortage of physicists because so many of them were engaged in war work. Princeton had commitments to teach army and navy personnel, and he needed physicists like Smyth to meet those commitments. Smyth therefore became a consultant at Chicago, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of designing a nuclear reactor that used heavy water as a neutron moderator, and commuted from Princeton, working in Chicago on alternate weeks.|$|E
