2500|$|According to the {{etiquette}} <b>guide,</b> Debrett's, <b>holders</b> of doctoral degrees and medical doctors (but not surgeons) {{should be addressed}} as [...] "Doctor". It {{should be noted that}} for medical doctors, [...] "Doctor" [...] is a professional title rather than an academic one: it is due to their being a medical practitioner rather than their having gained a doctoral degree. The Quality Assurance Agency states that [...] "The use of the title 'Dr' by medical doctors is a historical abbreviation for the profession; it does not indicate a qualification at doctoral level". On guest lists and seating plans for formal events, holders of academic doctorates (but not medical doctors or other people using the title as a courtesy title) are listed either as [...] "Dr John Smith" [...] or [...] "John Smith, Esq, PhD", while untitled men (other than those holding doctorates) are shown as either [...] "Mr John Smith" [...] or [...] "John Smith, Esq" [...] (as appropriate to ensure the styling remains consistent).

5000|$|Telescoping holders {{fall into}} two subcategories. The earlier of the {{telescoping}} variety were column-guided variations and were built from 1824. To guide the telescoping walls, or [...] "lifts", they have an external fixed frame, visible at a fixed height at all times. A refinement was the <b>guide</b> frame gas <b>holder,</b> where the heavy columns were replaced a lighter and more extensive framework. Vertical girders (standards) were intersected by horizontal girders and cross-braced. This could be bolted onto an underground or aboveground tank. The Cutler patented guide frame dispensed with the horizontal girders using diagonal triangulated framing instead[...] Cable-guided gas holders, invented by Pease in 1880, had a limited use, but were useful on unstable ground where the rigid systems could buckle and jam the lift.|$|R
40|$|A {{project with}} an {{objective}} of improving livelihoods of smallholder paddy producers by strengthening their capacities in packaging and marketing was implemented in Matufa village in Babati district from June 2013 to December 2013. The project was initiated following a participatory community needs assessment {{carried out in}} the village by the researcher, host CBO and Matufa village community. The needs assessment was guided by the following specific objectives; to obtain information which will help to improve livelihoods of small holder paddy farmers in Matufa village by increasing marketability of their farm products, to <b>guide</b> small <b>holder</b> paddy farmers in Matufa village in creating a good packaging system for their products in order to improve marketing, to develop participatory intervention strategies aimed at solving issues aroused during community needs assessment. The findings revealed among other things that, the Matufa village community was faced with an absence of village health centre, poor irrigation infrastructures, lack of reliable saving and credit services, poor market for produced crops, absence of a secondary school in the village and unavailability of agricultural implements. Among all the identified problems poor markets for produced crops was ranked as a major problem which required immediate intervention. Following the findings a participatory strategy for improving marketability of produced crops was developed and implemented by training farmers in marketing skills and packaging techniques. Farmers were also enabled to participate in various exhibitions to market their packed products...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: We have {{conducted}} experiments with an innovatively designed robot endoscope holder for laparoscopic surgery that {{is small and}} low cost. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A compact light endoscope robot (LER) that {{is placed on the}} patient's skin and can be used with the patient in the lateral or dorsal supine position was tested on cadavers and laboratory pigs in order to allow successive modifications. The current control system is based on voice recognition. The range of vision is 360 degrees with an angle of 160 degrees. Twenty-three procedures were performed. RESULTS: The tests made it possible to advance the prototype on a variety of aspects, including reliability, steadiness, ergonomics, and dimensions. The ease of installation of the robot, which takes only 5 minutes, and the easy handling made it possible for 21 of the 23 procedures to be performed without an assistant. CONCLUSION: The LER is a camera <b>holder</b> <b>guided</b> by the surgeon's voice that can eliminate the need for an assistant during laparoscopic surgery. The ease of installation and manufacture should make it an effective and inexpensive system for use on patients in the lateral and dorsal supine positions. Randomized clinical trials will soon validate a new version of this robot prior to marketing...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} use of {{expansive}} fiscal instruments {{in order to encourage}} the growth has produced in the past as it does today, a significant division among economists. This division is reflected in the doctrinal and practical aspects. Doctrinal aspect touches different approaches to state interventionism. While its supporters within Keynesian teachings believe that the recession could become a permanent condition if the state does not reach for anti-cyclical policies, the supporters of the infallibility of the market believe that it would result in inflation without affecting growth. This paper presents, with inevitable reference to the genesis of bipolar thinking, the results of empirical studies and our own research on the value of the relevant fiscal multipliers as realistic measures of effectualization of fiscal stimulus to economic growth. Conferring a direct connection between appropriate fiscal stimulus packages with the growth of economic activity will give an answer to the issue about the effectiveness of cyclic measures. It turned out that the results are different for developed countries compared to those who belong to the group of developing countries. It has been proved that for developing countries it is much more useful to rely on public investment in relation to the growth of public spending. It should serve as a <b>guide</b> to the <b>holders</b> of economic power in composing the measures that will form the anti-cyclical economic policies during the current crisis...|$|R
40|$|An {{in depth}} {{evaluation}} of safety {{is an essential}} component of the successful operation of nuclear facilities. The Safety Assessment Methodology is the tool applied to perform the safety evaluations of a facility in order to demonstrate satisfactory safety of such a facility to the operator, the National Nuclear Regulator (NNR) in South Africa, and to the public. A Safety Assessment is performed and documented to demonstrate the compliance with safety objectives, principles and criteria as stipulated by national and international standards. In South Africa the Department of Mineral and Energy publishes the National Nuclear Regulatory Requirements for demonstrating safety of a Nuclear Facility. As such, this Safety Assessment provides a formal structured procedure for defining the logic of systems and assessing the consequences if failure in the control logic occurs. This Safety Assessment demonstrates that the radioactive effluent generated at a typical nuclear facility the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation (Necsa) is managed according to national and internationally acceptable proven technology and standards. Those standards are documented in the National Nuclear Regulatory Act. Licensing documents have been issued by the Regulator to <b>guide</b> the <b>holder</b> of a nuclear installation licence to compile a Safety Assessment. International standards are provided by the International Atomic Energy Association (IAEA) through a number of technical documents and the Safety Standards Series. This Safety Assessment aims to show that the Radioactive Effluent Treatment Facility at Necsa can be operated without endangering the lives of the operators and the public and without having adverse effects on the environment. The hazards of operating a Radioactive Effluent Treatment Facility include radiological, chemical and conventional hazards. However, this Safety Assessment only focuses on the radiological (radiation and contamination) hazards and, in particular on the radiological hazards associated with the accidental exposure of an operator to Medium Activity Effluent. This report demonstrates the safety condition of the Radioactive Effluent Treatment Facility at Necsa by providing: 1. a systematic evaluation of consequences in the case of accidental exposure and 2. a documented demonstration of the controls in place to ensure that the workers, members of the public and environment are protected sufficiently, with the main focus being on worker exposure. The justification of the discharge of treated radioactive effluent into the environment is a globally accepted practice. This Safety Assessment briefly discusses environmental discharge practices but the main focus is on the analysis of the protection of the workers of the Radioactive Effluent Treatment Facility. The radioactive effluent is only discharged into the nearby Crocodile River if it is in compliance with discharge criteria as set by the National Nuclear Regulator and the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry...|$|R
40|$|This Bachelor's thesis deals attends to the {{lifestyle}} and competence of guide dog owners. Guide dogs belong amongst those compensation tools {{for people with}} more serious forms of sight disadvantage. The legislative definition for the compensation tool of the guide dog is specified in regulation No. 388 / 2011 Ed. about executing some regulation about providing subsidies or benefits to persons with this handicap as amended. This compensation tool is provided by Law No. 329 / 2011 Ed. on providing subsidies or benefits to persons with a handicap and about the change to laws as amended. The theory part of the Bachelor's thesis comprises four main chapters. The first chapter of the theory part attends to defining sight handicap and its influence or impact on a person's character. The second part defines the compensation tool of the guide dog {{as well as its}} definition in regulation No. 388 / 2011 Ed. about carrying out certain regulations about providing subsidies or benefits to persons with a handicap as amended. Its sub-chapters attend to breeds suitable for training as guide dogs, choice of a suitable puppy, training the guide dog, which includes pre-training, the training alone and subsequently handing over the guide dog to its new owner. It also includes organisations that deal with training guide dogs and last but not least it summarises briefly the history of training guide dogs in the Czech Republic. The third chapter familiarises readers with guide dog owners' competences, his/her rights and obligations, it also outlines legislation and other documentation associated with this issue. The last chapter attends to defining lifestyle as well as one's influence on his/her lifestyle. The practical part records the process and results of qualitative research on the topic of Lifestyle and Guide Dog Owners' Competence. The method used here was the method of questioning and a semi-standardised interview was chosen for the gathering data technique. The aim of the Bachelor's thesis was to find out how newly acquired rights and obligations influence the <b>guide</b> dog <b>holder's</b> lifestyle. The aim was also partially in the creating of a general idea about breeding standards and the attitudes of guide dog users. The following research questions were set for the Bachelor's thesis: 1. What influence do client's breeding obligations have on his/her life and how does he/she see it within the context of advantages brought by the guide dog? 2. How does a guide dog owner cope with the fact that puts an equal sign between the terms tool - living creature? Results of the research are characteristic for their sameness with the differences being basically slight. Results of the research by the respondent who does not currently attend Tyflokabinet České Budějovice, o. p. s., do not differ from those by other respondents. Research by all respondents clearly confirmed a positive relationship between the guide dog user and his/her guide dog. The quality of a guide dog owners' life increased as was assumed. Obligations associated with having a guide dog such as taking care of him/her, taking him/her for a walk and/or vaccination are not an obstacle for the users and their knowledge of the respondents' rights and advantages is of a high level. The research experience brought the author to discovering that the respondents that had participated in the research see the line between the terms of a guide dog - a tool or living creature in a very abstract way. The role of a guide dog changes in different situations. In some, the guide dog takes the role of a friend and companion whilst in some is a helper. This Bachelor's thesis can be used for studying purposes for students of associated specialisation. It can assist as an inspiration for concluding other scientific work...|$|R
40|$|Silicon {{is widely}} used in {{optoelectronic}} devices, including solar cells. In recent years new forms of silicon have become available, including amorphous, microcrystalline and nano-crystalline material. These new forms have great promise for low cost, thin film solar cells {{and the purpose of}} this work is to investigate their preparation and properties with a view to their future use in solar cells. A Hot Wire-Deposition Chemical Vapour Deposition CVD (HW-CVD) system was constructed to create a multi-chamber high vacuum system in combination with an existing Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition (PECVD) system; to study the amorphous to crystalline transition in silicon thin films. As the two chambers were linked by a common airlock, it was essential to construct a transfer mechanism to allow the transfer of the sample holder between the two systems. This was accomplished by the incorporation of two gate valves between the two chambers and the common airlock as well as a rail system and a magnetic drive that were designed to support the weight of, and to <b>guide</b> the sample <b>holder</b> through the system. The effect of different deposition conditions on the properties and structure of the material deposited in the combined HW-CVD:PECVD system were investigated. The conditions needed to obtain a range of materials, including amorphous, nano- and microcrystalline silicon films were determined and then successfully replicated. The structure of each material was analysed using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The presence of crystallites in the material was confirmed and the structure of the material detected by TEM was compared to the results obtained by Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectrum of each sample was decoupled into three components representing the amorphous, intermediate and crystalline phases. The Raman analysis revealed that the amorphous silicon thin film had a dominant amorphous phase with smaller contribution from the intermediate and crystalline phase. This result supported the findings of the TEM studies which showed some medium range order. Analysis of the Raman spectrum for samples deposited at increasing filament temperatures showed that the degree of order within the samples increased, with the evolution of the crystalline phase and decline of the amorphous phase. The Selected Area Diffraction (SAD) patterns obtained from the TEM were analysed to gain qualitative information regarding the change in crystallite size. These findings have been confirmed by the TEM micrograph measurements. The deposition regime where the transition from amorphous to microcrystalline silicon took place was examined by varying the deposition parameters of filament temperature, total pressure in the chamber, gas flow rate, deposition time and substrate temperature. The IR absorption spectrum for [mu]c-Si showed the typical peaks at 2100 cm- 1 and 626 cm- 1, of the stretching and wagging modes, respectively. The increase in the crystallinity of the thin films was consistent with the evolution of the 2100 cm- 1 band in IR, and the decreasing hydrogen content, as well as the shift of the wagging mode to lower wavenumber. IR spectroscopy {{has proven to be a}} sensitive technique for detecting the crystalline phase in the deposited material. Several devices were also constructed by depositing the [mu]c-Si thin films as the intrinsic layer in a solar cell, to obtain information on their characteristics. The p- layer (amorphous silicon) was deposited in the PECVD chamber, and the sample was then transferred under vacuum using the transport system to the HW-CVD chamber where the i-layer (microcrystalline silicon) was deposited. The sample holder was transferred back to the PECVD chamber where the n-layer (amorphous silicon) was deposited. The research presented in this thesis represents a preliminary investigation of the properties of [mu]c-Si thin films. Once the properties and optimum deposition characteristics for thin films are established, this research can form the basis for the optimization of a solar cell consisting of the most efficient combination of amorphous, nano- and microcrystalline materials...|$|R
