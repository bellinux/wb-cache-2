40|$|During burrow digging by {{the mole}} cricket Scapteriscus acletus Rehn and Hubbard, the burrow is {{enlarged}} and shaped {{in a series}} of digging cycles, each lasting 1 — 2 min, and song chirps are produced after every cycle. The song becomes up to 18 dB louder and acoustically purer during burrow building. The shape of the song pulse envelope changes so that its average power density becomes greater and its build-up and decay become more gradual. The forewings show a single resonance of the harp (Cu 1 cell) regions at 2 - 5 — 3 0 kHz: the normal song carrier frequency is 2 - 5 — 2 - 7 kHz. Removal of the outer parts of the forewings does not affect the radiated sound power. The singing burrow has an exponential <b>horn</b> <b>opening</b> at the soil surface and an internal bulb. The calculated cut-off frequency of the horn is 1 - 34 kHz and that of the first resonance is 2 - 5 - 2 - 7 kHz. The volume of the bulb is close to that required to tune the throat: obliteration of the burrow bulb causes a substantial decrease in the radiated sound pressure levels before singing ceases. The horn mouth acts as a finite sound source, with large acoustic reactance. The acoustics of the burrow were measured with a small doublet source inserted at the position at which the cricket sings. At this position, the burrow resonates at 2 - 75 - 3 kHz, with a quality factor (Q), measured both by the — 3 dB bandwidth and by the build-up and decay of tone bursts, of 2 - 5 - 2 - 7. The sound pressure produced by the doublet source is up to 24 dB louder when it is in the burrow than when it is in free air. Further in or out from the insect's singing position, the effective gain of the burrow is reduced and other resonances and anti-resonances are observed. Obliteration of the burrow bulb reduces the effective gain of the burrow by 6 — 10 dB and the burrow ceases to resonate at 2 - 75 kHz. It is proposed that the tuned burrow acts as a resistive load on the vibrating harps, so allowing good coupling between the small wings and the surrounding medium while allowing a pure carrier frequency to be radiated...|$|E

40|$|Voltage gated calcium {{channels}} (VGCCs) {{are well}} established mediators of pain signals in primary afferent neurons. N-type calcium channels are localized to synaptic nerve terminals in laminae 1 and 2 of the dorsal <b>horn</b> where their <b>opening</b> {{results in the}} release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate and substance P. The contribution of N-type channels to the processing of pain signals is regulated by alternate splicing of the N-type channel gene, with unique N-type channel splice variants being expressed in small nociceptive neurons. In contrast, T-type VGCCs of the Cav 3. 2 subtype are likely localized to nerve endings where they regulate cellular excitability. Consequently, inhibition of N-type and Cav 3. 2 T-type VGCCs has the propensity to mediate analgesia. T-type channel activity is regulated by redox modulation, and can be inhibited by a novel class of small organic blockers. N-type VGCC activity can be potently inhibited by highly selective peptide toxins that are delivered intrathecally, {{and the search for}} small organic blockers with clinical efficacy is ongoing.

Cartoon music historian Daniel Goldmark notes that Popeye is one of few cartoon characters of the time to have a theme: Disney/Warner Bros. composer Carl Stalling and MGM's Scott Bradley disliked themes and phased them out quickly. For the first few cartoons, the opening-credits music consisted of an instrumental of [...] "The Sailor's Hornpipe," [...] followed by a vocal variation on [...] "Strike Up the Band (Here Comes a Sailor)," [...] substituting the words [...] "for Popeye the Sailor" [...] in the latter phrase. [...] "I Yam What I Yam" [...] {{was used as the}} theme song for further cartoons. Goldmark divides the Popeye theme into two parts: the sailor horn pipe and the lyrical portion. The <b>opening</b> <b>horn</b> pipe can be dated back to the 1700s and further as a traditional sea shanty. Winston Sharples and Sammy Timberg composed most of the music for Popeye shorts.

40|$|Illegal {{wildlife}} trade {{presents a}} serious threat to the long-term survival of certain species, which can have serious ecological and socio-economic consequences. Officials attempting to enforce wildlife trade legislation are often hampered by difficulties associated with the accurate identification of such items. In response, this thesis describes the development and application of molecular tools for the analysis of animal parts and derivatives, with reference to two main contemporary issues; namely, the illegal trade in bear (Ursid) parts and derivatives, and the illegal trade in rhinoceros parts and derivatives. A qualitative lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) dipstick was developed for bear serum albumin detection. The visual detection limit was 10 ppm of bear serum with a reaction time of 5 min. The LFIA was validated on serum, blood, skin and liquid bile, and was able to detect bear albumin in all these sample types. Items confiscated during enforcement activities were also tested and the results confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. PCR primers were designed such that DNA from ursine species could be amplified from samples containing mixed-species DNA. The VIA accurately identified genuine bear bile crystals and bear bile capsules, although it was unable to consistently identify bear bone and some of the more complex traditional Asian medicines (TAM). The test can be performed by persons with little or no scientific training and may provide a novel method for customs and law enforcement officials to screen purported bear bile samples and gallbladders in the field. The feasibility of using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA for individual identification in the white rhinoceros, Ceratotherium simum, was assessed. A molecular method for sexing rhinoceros samples was developed and incorporated into a short tandem repeat (STR) profiling assay. which was then partially-validated for forensic use and used to screen various rhinoceros sample types (horn, blood, tissue) from wild and captive white rhinoceros. The recovery of nuclear DNA (microsatellites) from rhinoceros <b>horn</b> is demonstrated, <b>opening</b> up the possibility of being able to match confiscated horn samples to a particular rhino carcass.

5000|$|The showpiece can {{be divided}} into three main sections, loosely {{following}} an ABA format. Légende Op. 17 is in G minor, but the middle section is in the major mode. It is in 3/4 time. The mood is set from the start with a low melody in the horns, accompanied by delicate pizzicato (plucking) in the string sections. After the brief orchestral introduction, the solo violin part enters, with a soft, simple melodic line. As the piece progresses, Wieniawski intensifies the music by having the orchestral strings switch from pizzicato to arco (bowed) and by adding embellishments and turns to the solo violin part. Wieniawski further intensifies the solo violin part through usage of double stops. Within the first section, the main theme repeats itself, with the same orchestral music of the beginning of the piece serving as an interlude-like return to the repeat of the violin theme. In the repeat of the theme, the orchestral texture is varied slightly, with much more usage of pizzicato in the strings. At {{the end of the first}} section, the violin part imitates the opening melody of the horn section. [...] A significant cadence is reached on the tonic G, and the second section begins, this time in the major mode. The overall mood of the piece changes here, as the meter changes to duple and the tempo increases. The orchestra plays a march-like motif underneath the solo violin part, which has a swift, moving part full of double stops and chords. The playful mood is further enhanced by the violinist's usage of slides. Throughout this section, Wieniawski includes brief passages in the minor mode to foreshadow the eventual return to it in the last section. The orchestral and solo violin parts both create a long crescendo as the musical line ascends and intensifies. At the climax, the violin plays a rapid descending chromatic scale, and upon reaching the bottom, the music transitions back into the opening minor theme, again in 3/4 time. [...] At the start of the third section, the <b>opening</b> <b>horn</b> melody returns. After another brief orchestral interlude, the violin theme of the beginning returns. The violin part recapitulates the melody, and then executes scalar and arpeggio passages all the while making a decrescendo, ending softly on a high G (three octaves above middle C).|$|R
