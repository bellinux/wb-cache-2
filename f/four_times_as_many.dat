5|$|In general, {{the latest}} {{aggregated}} {{research has found}} {{no difference in the}} prevalence of self-harm between men and women. This is in contrast to past research which indicated that up to <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> females as males have direct experience of self-harm. However, caution is needed in seeing self-harm as a greater problem for females, since males may engage in different forms of self-harm (e.g., hitting themselves) which could be easier to hide or explained as the result of different circumstances. Hence, there remain widely opposing views as to whether the gender paradox is a real phenomenon, or merely the artifact of bias in data collection.|$|E

40|$|Quantitative {{electron}} microscopic autoradiography {{was used}} for comparing the binding of labeled somatostatin- 14 (S- 14) and somatostatin- 28 (S- 28 section) to islet cells.

Autoradiographic grains (ARG) associated with individual islet cells were identified and expressed as the mean number per B, A, and D cells. Specific ARG associated with S- 14 were found over B and A cells. S- 28 section-related specific ARG were concentrated over B, A, as well as D cells. The highest density of S- 14 section labeling occurred over A cells, which under conditions of maximum labeling (37 degrees C for 60 min) contained five <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> ARG <b>as</b> did B cells. By contrast, under the same incubation conditions, the labeling density with S- 28 section was maximal over B cells, which contained <b>four</b> and five <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> grains <b>as</b> A and D cells, respectively. These observations show preferential association of S- 14 section with the A cell and S- 28 section with the B cel provide strong evidence for the existence of separate binding sites for S- 14 section and S- 28 section on A and B cells, respectively, which presumably mediate the previously reported glucagon selective inhibitory effect of S- 14 and the insulin-selective action of S- 28...|$|R

40|$|Pregnancy {{registries}} are {{the most}} commonly used data resource for the post-marketing surveillance of drug teratogenicity. However, the limited sample size and potential selection bias in these registries has led us to investigate the potential of the UK General Practice Research Database (GPRD) as an alternative data source for monitoring drug safety during pregnancy. In addition, a literature review identified further observational data sources that monitor pregnancy outcomes for future evaluation. Initial feasibility studies focused on the ability of the GPRD to capture pregnancy outcomes for a range of drug class exposures, all of which are currently under investigation in pregnancy registries, during pregnancy. The comparator pregnancy registries were identified via a MEDLINE search, whilst eligible pregnancies, in which women received one or more prescriptions for the drug of interest during pregnancy, were identified in the GPRD using the mother-baby link. The number of pregnancy outcomes following exposure to medication for a range of conditions with varying prevalence, including depression, migraine, epilepsy, herpes simplex and HIV, captured by the two data sources were compared. For depression, a relatively prevalent condition, the GPRD recorded the same number of mean annual intrauterine exposures to fluoxetine as the pregnancy registry (118 exposures/year). Ascertainment of intrauterine exposure to drug treatments for less prevalent conditions was found to be higher for the pregnancy registries than the GPRD; for the older antiepileptic drugs (valproate and carbamazepine), the pregnancy registry recorded between <b>four</b> and five <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> mean annual exposures as the GPRD. Virtually no antiretroviral exposures (three) were identified during the time period of interest on the GPRD, compared with 3946 in the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry. Data from the GPRD meet established criteria for evaluating outcomes of pregnancy. For prevalent conditions, {{it has the potential to}} replace or work alongside standard pregnancy registries and the alternative data sources identified. Further studies are now needed to assess its ability to replicate known teratogenic associations...|$|R

6000|$|The duty enjoined {{in these}} {{decisions}} was commenced without delay. Heaton and Unus were {{left at the}} Peak, as usual, to look after things in that quarter, {{and to keep the}} mill from being idle, while {{all the rest of the}} men returned to the Reef, and set about the work on the ship. The first step taken was to send down all the spars and rigging that remained aloft; after which everything was got up out of the hold, and rolled, or dragged ashore. Of cargo, strictly speaking, the Rancocus had very little in weight, but she had a great many water-casks, <b>four</b> or five <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> would have been put into her in an ordinary voyage. These casks had all been filled with fresh water, to answer the double purpose of a supply for the people, and as ballast for the ship. When these casks were all got on deck, and the water was started, it was found that the vessel floated several inches lighter than before. The sending ashore of the spars, sails, rigging, lumber, provisions, &c., produced a still further effect, and, after carefully comparing the soundings, and the present draught of the vessel, the governor found it would be necessary to lift the last only eight inches, to get her out of her natural dock. This result greatly encouraged the labourers, who proceeded with renewed spirit. As it would be altogether useless to overhaul the rigging, caulk decks, &c., unless the ship could be got out of her berth, everybody worked with that end in view at first. In the course of a week, the water-casks were under her bottom, and it was thought that the vessel would have about an inch to spare. A gale having blown in the water, and a high tide coming at the same time, the governor determined to try the experiment of crossing the barrier. The order came upon the men suddenly, for no one thought the attempt would be made, until the ship was lifted an inch or two higher. But Mark saw what the wind had been doing for them, and he lost not a moment. The vessel was moved, brought head to her course, and the lines were hauled upon. Away went the Rancocus, which was now moved for the first time since the eruption! ...|$|R

40|$|Agricultural straw {{mulching}} is {{a commonly}} used post-fire hillslope erosion control treatment that is aerially applied by helicopter. While widely used and reasonably effective at reducing erosion, agricultural straw is not {{native to the}} forest environment. There is a growing consensus among Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) teams that mulch made from native forest material would be preferable to agricultural straw. Wood shred mulch made from post-fire road hazard trees is an alternative to agricultural straw. An optimized blend of sizes of wood shreds was effective in reducing sediment yields in both indoor rainfall simulation and outdoor field experiments. Several post-wildfire field experiments showed that wood shreds and agricultural straw were effective in reducing sediment yields {{as compared to the}} controls but neither treatment had an effect on runoff. Erosion reductions from wood shred treatments ranged from 50 - 96 % in these experiments, and the presence and effectiveness of wood shreds appears to outlast both agricultural straw and hydromulch. Wood shreds are denser than agricultural straw and, as a consequence, about 4 times more wood shreds (by weight) than straw are needed to provide the same ground cover in a designated area. As a result, a helicopter with cargo nets required about <b>four</b> to five <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> round trips to treat an acre with wood shreds as with agricultural straw. This made wood shred application take longer and cost more than agricultural straw ($ 1, 500 to $ 2, 000 per acre [$ 3, 750 to $ 5, 000 per ha] and $ 500 per acre [$ 1, 250 per ha], respectively). Field tests using a Heli-Claw, an alternative to a cargo net for heli-mulching, suggest that the Heli-Claw is a viable option for the aerial application of wood shreds. Results from these studies were disseminated through publications and a wide range of presentations, such as webinars, national meetings, and regional specialists meetings; thus, research findings have been directly conveyed to BAER teams and land managers.
