500|$|Over {{the course}} of several years, Grant's {{political}} opinions shifted from libertarian socialism to free market based philosophies. Grant later speculated that this transformation would be detectable within stories he'd written. By 1997, Grant's philosophy settled on Neo-Tech, which was developed by Frank R. Wallace, and when given the opportunity to write an Anarky miniseries, he decided to redesign the character accordingly. Grant laid out his reasoning in an interview just before the first issue's publication. [...] "I felt he was the perfect character" [...] to express Neo-Tech philosophy, Grant explained, [...] "because he's human, he has no special powers, the only power he's <b>got</b> <b>is</b> the power of his own rational consciousness". This new characterization was continued in the 1999 Anarky ongoing series.|$|E
40|$|The {{first case}} of {{macromolecular}} <b>GOT</b> <b>was</b> reported by lida et al. in 1973, {{and since then}} only 11 cases have been reported. In the present paper, we report two cases of abnormally elevated serum <b>GOT,</b> which <b>was</b> difficult to explain by organic disorders. Using various biochemical and immunological methods, the <b>GOT</b> <b>was</b> concluded to <b>be</b> macromolecular <b>GOT.</b> Sephadex G- 100 column chromatography was carried out to estimate the molecular size. After dividing the GOT into isoenzymes by Cellogel membrane electrophoresis, the <b>GOTs</b> <b>were</b> dyed using the GLDH method developed by Lippe. The immunofixation method {{was used to examine}} what kind of immunogloblin combined with <b>GOT.</b> Case 1 <b>was</b> a 69 -year-old woman with angina pectoris and hypertension. Her serum <b>GOT</b> level <b>was</b> 279 IU/l. Her serum <b>GOT</b> <b>was</b> found to be combined with IgG-x. Case 2 was an 8 -year-old boy who suffered from bronchial asthma. His serum <b>GOT</b> levels <b>were</b> highly elevated (192 IU/L). The <b>GOT</b> <b>was</b> combined with IgG-λ. In both cases, we estimated the GOT molecular weight to be 14, 0000 Daltons...|$|R

This fragile, malleable, devastated child, basically, is sitting there without anybody to comfort him, and if she had been there, he wouldn't have gone out that window. She failed him, and she alone failed him here." [...] Benioff continued about portraying the mindset of Cersei Lannister, saying [...] "I think the idea of Cersei without her children is a pretty terrifying prospect. It was the one thing that really humanized her, you know, her love for her kids. And as much of a monster as she could sometimes be, she was a mother who truly really did love her children, and now those children are gone, and all she's <b>got</b> <b>is</b> power." [...] In a subsequent interview after the episode airing, Weiss stated that Cersei's mindset following the ramifications of this episode will {{play an important role in}} the story for the next season.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of several years, Grant's {{political}} opinions shifted from libertarian socialism to free market-based philosophies. Alan Grant commented on the philosophical pattern the character's transformation took for a 1997 interview: [...] "Although I haven’t read them in chronological order I would think it would be quite easy to see the parallel between Anarky’s thought processes and my own thought processes." [...] By 1997 he had settled on the philosophy of Neo-Tech, a philosophy developed by Frank R. Wallace. At approximately the same time he was when given the opportunity to write an Anarky mini-series, and so decided to revamp the character accordingly. Grant laid out his reasoning in an interview just before the first issue's publication. [...] "I felt he was the perfect character" [...] to express Neo-Tech philosophy, Grant explained, [...] "because he's human, he has no special powers, the only power he's <b>got</b> <b>is</b> the power of his own rational consciousness". This new characterization was later carried on in the 1999 Anarky ongoing series.|$|E
500|$|... "Boston-style" [...] songwriting {{refers to}} the introspective and literate breed of singer-songwriter so {{prevalent}} in the modern folk music landscape. According to Paul, Boston-style songwriting grew out of Boston's thriving folk scene with its dense collection of colleges, college radio stations and listening rooms. [...] Boston radio includes the University of Massachusetts' WUMB, the country's foremost radio station for folk and acoustic music 24-hours a day. [...] Paul said the Boston songwriters {{tend to be more}} thoughtful and soft because in an intimate listening room, [...] "all you've <b>got</b> <b>is</b> you and your words." [...] Boston-style songwriting tends to be more about lyric than melody, is intimate and thoughtful but also relevant, often addressing social issues. [...] Boston-style songwriting does not only refer to Boston musicians, but includes national artists such as Shawn Colvin, John Gorka, Susan Werner, Bill Morrissey, and Dar Williams. [...] In an interview with Paul Freeman for the East Bay Daily News, Paul commented on how he hopes audience members relate to his songs, [...] "Each song is supposed to be like a little three-dimensional world. I'm hoping to invite them in, have them make out the details and the reasons for being there, and apply them to their own lives. But I'm also hoping to entertain them." ...|$|E

500|$|He {{signed for}} Crawley for an {{undisclosed}} fee on 31 August 2010, the transfer being completed three minutes before the transfer deadline. The fee was reported by The Press to be around £300,000, although Crawley co-owner Bruce Winfield dismissed this figure, saying [...] "it was nowhere near that". The Non-League Paper reported the fee to be £275,500; if true, this meant a new record had been set for the highest transfer fee between two non-League clubs. After signing, Brodie said [...] "What they're trying to plan here and the aims this club have <b>got</b> <b>is</b> to be a Football League club. They've got as good a chance as anybody." [...] He made his debut as a 55th-minute substitute in a 1–1 home draw with Fleetwood Town on 4 September 2010. On his first start, Brodie scored his first goal for Crawley with the second goal in a 2–0 victory away to Histon on 11 September 2010. Crawley rejected an offer for him from an unnamed League Two club in January 2011. Brodie struggled to force {{his way into the}} Crawley starting line-up on a regular basis, and finished the season with 13 goals in 45 appearances for Crawley as the club won the Conference Premier title and therefore promotion into League Two.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Mercury had a {{long-term}} relationship with Mary Austin, whom he met through guitarist Brian May. He lived with Austin for several years in West Kensington, London. By the mid-1970s, the singer had begun {{an affair with a}} male American record executive at Elektra Records and, in December 1976, Mercury told Austin of his sexuality, which ended their romantic relationship. Mercury moved out of the flat they shared, into 12 Stafford Terrace in Kensington and bought Austin a place of her own nearby. They remained close friends through the years, with Mercury often referring to her as his only true friend. In a 1985 interview, Mercury said of Austin, [...] "All my lovers asked me why they couldn't replace Mary , but it's simply impossible. The only friend I've <b>got</b> <b>is</b> Mary and I don't want anybody else. To me, she was my common-law wife. To me, it was a marriage. We believe in each other, that's enough for me." [...] He also wrote several songs about Austin, the most notable of which is [...] "Love of My Life". Mercury's final home, Garden Lodge, 1 Logan Place, a twenty-eight room Georgian mansion in Kensington set in a quarter-acre manicured garden surrounded by a high brick wall, had been picked out by Austin. In his will, Mercury left his London home to Austin, rather than his partner Jim Hutton, saying to her, [...] "You would have been my wife {{and it would have been}} yours anyway." [...] Mercury was also the godfather of Austin's oldest son, Richard.|$|E

2500|$|Gartside's {{change in}} beliefs {{directly}} affected {{the music and}} particularly the lyrics of Songs to Remember. In one interview with NME in October 1981 he told the paper, [...] "The politics have moved from an essentialist and reductionist position in which we believed in a history of science which could {{make sense of the}} future to one that realized that what you've <b>got</b> <b>is</b> needs, demands, and desires, and you go out and you fight for them. Which means that your music will at points be indexed fairly clearly to Politics with a big 'P' and at other points will cut across it completely." [...] In another interview with The Face the following year Gartside said, [...] "My loss has been political conviction, the idea of a correct understanding of the past, present and future (Marxism). I've always been obsessively concerned that my understanding of political truth should be scientifically grounded. Many songs [...] are about what happens when the anchor points of political, moral or religious understanding fall away." [...] For example, he stated that the track [...] "Faithless" [...] was about [...] "how living without faith brings you both happiness and sadness. I've never had any religion, except maybe politics, although I am interested in having some means of achieving social order and progress." ...|$|E
