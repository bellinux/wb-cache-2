5|$|Many {{theories}} have been advanced {{in way of}} explanation for decline of the Roman Empire, and many dates given for its fall, from the onset of its decline in the 3rd century to the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Militarily, however, the Empire finally fell after first being overrun by various non-Roman peoples and then <b>having</b> <b>its</b> heart in Italy seized by Germanic troops in a revolt. The historicity and exact dates are uncertain, and some historians do not consider that the Empire fell at this point.|$|E

5|$|Before AD 273, Palmyra enjoyed {{autonomy}} and {{was attached to}} the Roman province of Syria, <b>having</b> <b>its</b> political organization influenced by the Greek city-state model during the first two centuries AD. The city became a Roman colonia during the third century, leading to the incorporation of Roman governing institutions, before becoming a monarchy in 260. Following its destruction in 273, Palmyra became a minor center under the Byzantines and later empires. Its destruction by the Timurids in 1400 reduced it to a small village. Under French Mandatory rule in 1932, the inhabitants were moved into the new village of Tadmur, and the ancient site became available for excavations.|$|E
5|$|Florestan died in 1856 and his son, Charles, who {{had already}} been ruling what {{remained}} of Monaco, succeeded him as Charles III (Illustration 15). Menton and Roquebrune officially became part of France in 1861, reducing Monaco's size at a stroke by 80%.

He rebuilt St Mary's Tower (Illustration 14) and completely restored the chapel, adding a new altar, and <b>having</b> <b>its</b> vaulted ceiling painted with frescoes, while outside the façade was painted by Jacob Froëschle and Deschler with murals illustrating various heroic deeds performed by the Grimaldi.

5|$|Further {{denominations}} {{ranging from}} $5000 to $500 million were issued {{in the period}} between August 2006 and May 2008 as cent cheques quickly became outmoded.

Since the functions were similar to Bearer cheques, it was in regular use as prices continue to rise. These cheques also carried time limits and limited security features. In the final months of the second dollar, the $200000 cheque was the lowest legal tender denomination by decree, despite <b>having</b> <b>its</b> expiry date extended twice. The $100000000 Bearer Cheque would have been the lowest legal tender denomination in circulation had the expiry dates of currency cheques been enforced without extension, with the $100 billion Agro Cheque being the highest whether or not the $200000 note was legal tender.|$|E

5|$|Mansaf is a {{traditional}} meal in the central West Bank and Naqab region in the southern West Bank, <b>having</b> <b>its</b> roots from the Bedouin population of ancient Arabia. It is mostly cooked on occasions such as, during holidays, weddings or a large gathering. Mansaf is cooked as a lamb leg or large pieces of lamb {{on top of a}} taboon bread that has usually been smothered with yellow rice. A type of thick and dried cheesecloth yogurt from goat's milk, called jameed, is poured on top of the lamb and rice to give it its distinct flavor and taste. The dish is also garnished with cooked pine nuts and almonds. The classic form of eating mansaf is using the right hand as a utensil. For politeness, participants in the feast tear pieces of meat to hand to the person next to them.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota has a {{continental}} climate, with hot summers and cold winters.

The areas near Lake Superior in the Minnesota Arrowhead region experience weather unique {{from the rest of the}} state. The moderating effect of Lake Superior keeps the surrounding area relatively cooler in the summer and relatively warmer in the winter, giving that region a smaller yearly temperature range. On the Köppen climate classification, much of the southern third of Minnesota—roughly from the Twin Cities region southward—falls in the hot summer humid continental climate zone (Dfa), and the northern two-thirds of Minnesota falls in the warm summer great continental climate zone (Dfb).|$|E

The Colorado Plateaus were uplifted 16million years ago and were segmented into different plateaus, each separated from its neighbors by faults and each <b>having</b> <b>its</b> own uplift rate.

The music, composed by Revo of Sound Horizon, was intended to evoke the feelings of classic series such as Dragon Quest and SaGa.|$|E
5|$|The {{long jump}} {{is one of}} the oldest track and field events, <b>having</b> <b>its</b> roots as one of the events within the ancient Greek pentathlon contest. The athletes would take a short run up and jump into an area of dug up earth, with the winner being the one who jumped farthest. Small weights (Halteres) were held in each hand during the jump then swung back and dropped near the end to gain extra {{momentum}} and distance. The modern long jump, standardised in England and the United States around 1860, bears resemblance to the ancient event although no weights are used. Athletes sprint along a length of track that leads to a jumping board and a sandpit. The athletes must jump before a marked line and their achieved distance is measured from the nearest point of sand disturbed by the athlete's body.|$|E
