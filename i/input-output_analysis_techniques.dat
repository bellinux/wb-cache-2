40|$|Environmental protection, {{economic}} development and social development {{are known to be}} three pillars of sustainability that should exist together for sustainable development. Sustainability assessment can be carried out for products, technologies, policies and processes. In this master thesis project, three pillars of sustainability are deeply studied with regards to electricity production technologies in Turkey for year 2020, in which futuristic projections are based on one chosen renewable energy scenario. In the context of this work, sustainability assessment of electricity production technologies is carried out in a way to cover greenhouse emissions, economical activity contribution and employment generation stemming from each type of technology with regards to environmental, social and economic aspects, respectively. The methods followed to realize this work comprise life cycle assessment and extended <b>input-output</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>techniques.</b> As extended input-output analysis enables to evaluate all three pillars of sustainability, a separate life cycle assessment is carried out for all electricity producing technologies to obtain a more peculiar environmental evaluation in the end. As all technologies are identified with respect to their impacts concerning environmental, social and economical concerns, the types of technologies to promote or eliminate are recommended finally...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in detailed multiregional input-output databases offers new opportunities {{to use these}} environmental accounting tools to explore the interrelationships between energy, water and food–the energy-water-food nexus. This paper takes the UK {{as a case study}} and calculates energy, water and food consumption-based accounts for 1997 - 2013. Policies, designed to reduce the environmental impact of consumption of products, can intervene at many stages in a product’s whole life-time from ‘cradle to gate’. We use <b>input-output</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>techniques</b> to investigate the interaction between the energy, water and food impacts of products at different points along their supply chains, from the extraction of material and burning of energy, to the point of final consumption. We identify the twenty most important final products whose large energy, water and food impacts could be captured by various demand-side strategies such as reducing food waste or dietary changes. We then use structural-path analysis to calculate the twenty most important supply chains whose impact could be captured by resource efficiency policies which act at the point of extraction and during the manufacturing process. Finally, we recognise that strategies that aim to reduce environmental impacts should not harm the socioeconomic well-being of the UK and her trade partners and suggest that pathways should be targeted where the employment and value added dependencies are relatively low...|$|E
40|$|Ireland is {{committed}} to limiting its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to 113 % of 1990 levels over the period 2008 - 12 and to 84 % of 2005 levels by 2020 under the Kyoto Agreement and the EU’s ’ 20 20 ’ by 2020 respectively. National policies have targeted many industry sectors but have failed to directly tackle GHG emissions associated with construction activity. This paper estimates energy and GHG emissions intensities of the Irish construction sector and subsectors and estimates its contribution to Irish national emissions. This information is used to identify and assess the impacts of policy measures which {{would result in a}} reduction in emissions from the sector in a cost-effective manner. Energy and emissions intensities are estimated using <b>input-output</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>techniques</b> applied to Irish construction sector. In 2005 the Irish construction sector was responsible for the emission of 13. 81 mtCO 2 eq, comprising 2. 37 mt (17 %) of direct on-site emissions, 5. 69 mt (41 %) upstream indirect domestic emissions and 5. 75 mt (42 %) upstream indirect emissions outside the state. Domestically arising direct and indirect emissions accounted for 3. 44 % and 8. 26 % of national emissions respectively. Approximately three-quarters of construction sector emissions were the result of activities relating to NACE 45. 2 ‘civil and structural construction works, etc’. Given the potential importance of the construction sector to national emissions, there is scope for the implementation of policies which specifically target it. Two such policies are proposed: direct emissions mitigation through a construction EcoDriving initiative; and the provision of information to allow the design and specification of low-emissions materials...|$|E

40|$|Numerous public {{policies}} have been promulgated {{on the assumption that}} telecommunications will be a useful trip reduction instrument. However, many scholars have suggested that the predominant effect of telecommunications may be complementarity – increasing travel. Although short-term, disaggregate studies of single applications such as telecommuting have tended to find a substitution effect, more comprehensive studies, on the aggregate scale, are needed. One of the few such studies used <b>input-output</b> <b>analysis</b> to examine relationships between transportation and communication input intensities across 44 industry classes in Europe for 1980, and found strong evidence of complementarity. The present study has applied a similar methodology to the input-output accounts for the US across multiple points in time. Specifically, this study applied the <b>input-output</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>technique</b> developed by Leontief in 1936 to analyze the relationship between transportation and communications as industrial inputs in the U. S. Generally, <b>input-output</b> <b>analysis</b> offers a static view of the structural relationships, expressed purely in monetary terms, among the different sectors of an economy for a certain period of time. We analyzed correlations between transportation and communications using the input coefficients of transportation and communications in the input-output table (direct coefficients matrix). Positive correlation coefficients indicate complementarity: industries that require a lot of transportation inputs also tend to require a lot of communications inputs, and conversely. Negative correlation coefficients imply substitution. Ten benchmark I-O accounts (between 1947 and 1997, inclusive) were collected, which are prepared using the most detailed data sources available, generally the economic censuses. Trying to find the best balance between highly disaggregated industry classifications (which may exhibit a lot of random noise that would obscure the pattern of interest) and highly aggregated ones (which contain such a small number of cases that it may also be hard to identify underlying relationships), we created four scenarios reflecting different levels of aggregation across sub-industries. Scenario 1 is the most disaggregate level (containing 79 - 131 categories, depending on year), while Scenario 4 is the most aggregate categorization, containing just the nine top-level industries. We analyzed correlations for five selected pairs of transportation and communications industry categories: the manufacturing pair (i. e., transportation manufacturing correlated with communications manufacturing), the utilities pair, the two manufacturing-utilities pairs, and the overall pair (all transportation manufacturing and utilities correlated with all communications manufacturing and utilities). In this study the Spearman correlation is used, which is a nonparametric correlation measure. Since the input-output coefficients are not normally distributed, the Pearson correlation coefficients are not strictly appropriate. Using Spearman correlations, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis for each time period, and compared results across time based on the five sets of correlations between transportation and communications. Thus, 200 correlation coefficients in all are computed in this study (five sets for each of four scenarios for each of 10 benchmark years) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{the paper}} an {{innovative}} method {{is applied to}} generate a forecast of regional em-ployment. In common extrapolation problems the entries of a base matrix are used to estimate the elements of an unknown matrix. In the present problem of forecasting the base matrix is given for a time period {{in the past and}} the matrix to be estimated is related to a future period. In this paper a generalisation of this approach is used since the data about the past is given for a number of points in time and not only for a single period. The Generalized Extrapolation Method (GEM) developed to take this information into account is related to well-known methods of panel analysis based on models with fixed ef-fects. Additionally, it is similar to the techniques of entropy optimization. The objective func-tion to compare {{the past and the future}} is a modified chi-squared statistic, which is approxi-mately equal to the relative entropy function often used in gravity models and in <b>input-output</b> <b>analysis.</b> The <b>technique</b> is demonstrated with respect to the example of employment in all 327 (western) German districts for a time span of two years.

40|$|The role, {{played by}} {{globalization}} and the “just in time” supplying logic in present world economic scenario, {{implies that the}} opportunity of frequent, quick, safe and low-priced freight deliveries {{can be considered a}} key element for competitiveness. For these reasons, transportation systems, in the last years, have been characterized by the diffusion of intermodality and the “hub and spoke” distribution pattern. The phenomenon of organizing freight transport services according to a network and modal integration logic, has involved also the air transport field: to meet the new requirements of freight transportation market, in many cases, airline companies have become “global players”, expanding their network, in order to develop links among the main economic centres in the world. The goods moving by air can be defined as “top range products”; which means that only high value products (“market value” and “need value”) and the perishable ones (from a physical and economic point of view) demand air transport. The research described in this abstract aims at determining the contribution that can derive from air logistics to face a challenging problem: overcoming the peripheral role, in international trade, played by Sicily, which can boast high quality outputs in the agroindustrial sector and in the high technology one. The research consists of the following stages: 1. Analysing the sicilian freight transport system, with regard to the demand-supply relationship, paying particular attention to the commodity typologies mentioned above. 2. Identifying key actions for the air cargo services, in order to make Sicily improve in competitiveness, also taking into account the possibility of connecting Sicily with hub airports. 3. Determining the economic and social impact of the proposed solutions, considering different evolutionary scenarios and using also <b>input-output</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>techniques.</b> ...|$|E

Under the globalised economy, each economy’s industry is heavily interdependent across borders.

40|$|Abstract: Forecasts of {{regional}} employment serve a double purpose. On {{the one hand}} they include a strict test of the identification of causal processes, which generate differing rates of employment in regions. On the other hand they are useful for the planning of the measures of active labour market policy. In the paper an innovative method is applied to generate this forecast.

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{continuation}} of an earlier one which was initiated to establish quantitative relationships among agricultural and nonagricultural sectors of the economy. These relationships are of interest because of increased interdependence of sectors as the economic structure of our society becomes more complex. Agriculture is becoming more dependent upon {{the rest of the economy}} for its inputs. In the earlier study, Peterson and Heady (34) estimated that input purchases by farmers from industry increased from 28 cents per dollar of crop output in 1929, to nearly 50 cents per dollar of crop output in 1949. Future data are likely to reflect even greater interdependence between agriculture and industry. The national government has assumed, and is likely to maintain, an increased role in consciously affecting the nature and the intensity of economic activity. If this task is to be carried out intelligently, prior knowledge of the structure of the economy is essential. Historically, the source of such knowledge has been research considering small segments of the economy alone. <b>Input-output</b> <b>analysis</b> (27), the <b>technique</b> used in this study, allows a general equilibrium analysis of the relationships among all economic sectors.
