5|$|The new Memorial Gardens {{incorporate}} the war memorial which was moved from Victoria Square {{as part of}} the project. The planting employs a naturalistic style with broad drifts of <b>herbaceous</b> <b>perennials</b> and grasses providing colour through a long season, extending through the winter with dry stems and seed heads.|$|E
5|$|Variety in texture, {{height and}} timing of floral display were equally {{important}} horticultural considerations. The beds around each headstone are planted {{with a mixture of}} floribunda roses and <b>herbaceous</b> <b>perennials.</b> Low-growing plants are chosen for areas immediately in front of headstones, ensuring that inscriptions are not obscured and preventing soil from splashing back during rain. In cemeteries where there are pedestal grave markers, dwarf varieties of plants are used instead.|$|E
5|$|Member {{species are}} usually annuals or <b>herbaceous</b> <b>perennials.</b> Flowers are red, pink, or yellow, often in various combinations. A {{large number of}} the Erythranthe species grow in moist to wet soils with some growing even in shallow water. They are not very drought resistant, {{but many of the}} species now {{classified}} as Diplacus are. Species are found at elevations from oceanside to high mountains as well as a wide variety of climates, though most prefer wet areas such as riverbanks.|$|E

5|$|Plants are {{classified}} as trees, shrubs, <b>herbaceous</b> <b>perennials,</b> and annual herbs (poai); these divisions are acknowledged to be rough and ready, as is the division into wild or cultivated, whereas the aquatic/terrestrial division appeared to be natural. Theophrastus notes that some plants are irregular, while the silver fir has branches always opposite each other and other plants have branches equally spaced or in rows. Figs have the longest roots, while the banyan sends roots down from the shoots, forming a circle of roots at a distance all round the trunk.|$|E
5|$|Thousands {{of plant}} species are {{cultivated}} for aesthetic purposes {{as well as}} to provide shade, modify temperatures, reduce wind, abate noise, provide privacy, and prevent soil erosion. Plants are the basis of a multibillion-dollar per year tourism industry, which includes travel to historic gardens, national parks, rainforests, forests with colorful autumn leaves, and festivals such as Japan's and America's cherry blossom festivals. While some gardens are planted with food crops, many are planted for aesthetic, ornamental, or conservation purposes. Arboretums and botanical gardens are public collections of living plants. In private outdoor gardens, lawn grasses, shade trees, ornamental trees, shrubs, vines, <b>herbaceous</b> <b>perennials</b> and bedding plants are used. Gardeners may cultivate the plants in a naturalistic state, or may sculpture their growth, as with topiary or espalier. Gardening is the most popular leisure activity in the U.S., and working with plants or horticulture therapy is beneficial for rehabilitating people with disabilities. Plants may also be grown or kept indoors as houseplants, or in specialized buildings such as greenhouses that are designed for the care and cultivation of living plants. Venus Flytrap, sensitive plant and resurrection plant are examples of plants sold as novelties. There are also art forms specializing in the arrangement of cut or living plant, such as bonsai, ikebana, and the arrangement of cut or dried flowers. Ornamental plants have sometimes changed the course of history, as in tulipomania.|$|E
25|$|Many trees, shrubs, vines, {{ferns and}} other <b>herbaceous</b> <b>perennials</b> form clonal colonies naturally. Parts of an {{individual}} plant may become detached by fragmentation and grow on to become separate clonal individuals. A common example is in the vegetative reproduction of moss and liverwort gametophyte clones by means of gemmae. Some vascular plants e.g. dandelion and certain viviparous grasses also form seeds asexually, termed apomixis, resulting in clonal populations of genetically identical individuals.|$|E

25|$|Chamaenerion is a genus of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} family Onagraceae (the willowherb family). It is sometimes included in the genus Epilobium. Members of the genus may be called willowherbs (along with Epilobium), or fireweeds, based on a common name used for C.angustifolium. They are upright <b>herbaceous</b> <b>perennials,</b> growing from a woody base or from rhizomes, with racemes of usually purple to pink flowers. All species {{are found in the}} northern hemisphere. Most occur in moist habitats; C.angustifolium is the exception, favouring disturbed ground.|$|E
25|$|Chamaenerion {{species are}} upright <b>herbaceous</b> <b>perennials</b> with either {{unbranched}} stems or, much less often, slightly branched stems. They either have a woody base or grow from rhizomes. The leaves are generally spirally arranged on the stems {{and are usually}} narrow, rarely ovate. The inflorescence is a simple or slightly branched raceme. Individual flowers have four petals that are rose-purple to pink, rarely white. The petals are free at the base rather than united in a floral tube, as in Epilobium. The lower petals are narrower than the upper ones, making the flower radially unsymmetric (zygomorphic). There are eight more-or-less equally sized stamens, and a long, four-lobed style. The fruit is a long, thin, four-chambered (loculicidal) capsule that splits to reveal the many seeds. The seeds have a tuft of hairs at one end.|$|E
25|$|The {{order is}} clearly {{circumscribed}} {{on the basis}} of molecular phylogenetics, but is difficult to define morphologically, since its members are structurally diverse. Most species of Asparagales are <b>herbaceous</b> <b>perennials,</b> although some are climbers and some are tree-like. The order also contains many geophytes (bulbs, corms and various kinds of tuber). According to telomere sequence, at least two evolutionary switch-points happened within the order. Basal sequence is formed by TTTAGGG like in majority of higher plants. Basal motif was changed to vertebrate-like TTAGGG and finally the most divergent motif CTCGGTTATGGG appears in Allium. One of the defining characteristics (synapomorphies) of the order is the presence of phytomelanin, a black pigment present in the seed coat, creating a dark crust. Phytomelanin is found in most families of the Asparagales (although not in Orchidaceae, thought to be a sister {{to the rest of the}} group).|$|E

500|$|Stebbins's review, [...] "The {{significance}} of polyploidy in plant evolution", published in American Naturalist in 1940, demonstrated how work done on artificial polyploids and natural polyploid complexes {{had shown that}} polyploidy was important in developing large, complex, and widespread genera. However, {{by looking at the}} history of polyploidy in plant families, he argued that polyploidy was only common in <b>herbaceous</b> <b>perennials</b> and infrequent in woody plants and annuals. As such, polyploids played a conservative role in evolution since problems with fertility prevented the acquisition and replication of new genetic material that might lead to a new line of evolution. This work continued with the 1947 paper [...] "Types of polyploids: their classification and significance", which detailed a system for the classification of polyploids and described Stebbins' ideas about the role of paleopolyploidy in angiosperm evolution, where he argued that chromosome number may be a useful tool for the construction of phylogenies. These reviews were highly influential and provided a basis for others to study the role of polyploidy in evolution.|$|E
2500|$|Potato {{plants are}} <b>herbaceous</b> <b>perennials</b> that grow about [...] high, {{depending}} on variety, with the leaves dying back after flowering, fruiting and tuber formation. They bear white, pink, red, blue, or purple flowers with yellow stamens. In general, the tubers of varieties with white flowers have white skins, while those of varieties with colored flowers {{tend to have}} pinkish skins. Potatoes are mostly cross-pollinated by insects such as bumblebees, which carry pollen from other potato plants, though {{a substantial amount of}} self-fertilizing occurs as well. Tubers form in response to decreasing day length, although this tendency has been minimized in commercial varieties.|$|E
2500|$|The {{boundary}} between the two species Mandragora autumnalis and Mandragora officinarum varies among authors, with some regarding them as the same species (see § Taxonomy below). Whatever distinction is used, plants of M.autumnalis are <b>herbaceous</b> <b>perennials,</b> with a large upright tap-root, often branched and sometimes shaped somewhat like a person. There {{is little or no}} stem, the leaves being borne in a basal rosette up to [...] across. The flowers are clustered at the centre of the rosette, each with five sepals, five petals and five stamens. Both the sepals and petals are fused at the base forming two five-lobed bell-shaped cups. The ovary has two chambers (locules) and a long style. The fruit is a fleshy berry with many seeds.|$|E

2500|$|The {{reserve is}} part of the Western Sudetes {{mountains}} stretching from south-central Poland along the northern border of the Czech Republic to eastern Germany. The mountains are located at the watershed dividing the Baltic Sea and North Sea basins. The area is known for its high biodiversity in four altitudinal vegetation belts, from submontane to alpine. The river valleys and lower layers form the sub-montane zone made up of forests of European beech (Fagus sylvatica), silver fir (Abies alba) and Carpathian spruce (Picea Abies). The higher parts form the montane vegetation zone characterized by forested areas of Carpathian spruce (Picea Abies). Above [...] is the subalpine zone, which is marked by dwarf mountain pine (Pinus mugo), mat-grass meadows and subarctic highmoors. There are three subapline bogs that support an extensive algal community important for migratory birds and raptors. The alpine vegetation zone, is characterized by large rocky deserts with <b>herbaceous</b> <b>perennials</b> such as Carici (rigidae)-Nardetum and Festucetum supinae.|$|E
2500|$|The overall {{morphology}} {{of these}} plants is highly reduced compared to {{other members of the}} Ericaceae, which are practically all subshrubs, shrubs, or trees. By contrast, the Monotropoideae are all <b>herbaceous</b> <b>perennials,</b> in which an annual shoot reemerges seasonally (in spring or early summer, depending on climate) from a perennial root. The shoot can be characterized as a single inflorescence or cluster of inflorescences, and is generally a raceme with one to many flowers per axis, though occasionally the raceme may be so reduced as to appear similar to a spike, and in Monotropa, the inflorescence can {{take the form of a}} solitary flower. Notably, the shoots are achlorophyllous, in keeping with the mycoheterotrophic and non-photosynthetic nature of the plant, and the plants have a striking and distinctive appearance, with coloration ranging from pure white to pastel tones to very bright yellow or red. (If the Pyroleae are included, many of these species are partially photosythentic, and have green vegetative tissue, though leaves are usually reduced to a basal rosette.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Seeds {{are very}} diverse in size. The dust-like orchid seeds are the smallest, with about one million seeds per gram; {{they are often}} {{embryonic}} seeds with immature embryos and no significant energy reserves. Orchids {{and a few other}} groups of plants are mycoheterotrophs which depend on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrition during germination and the early growth of the seedling. [...] Some terrestrial orchid seedlings, in fact, spend {{the first few years of}} their lives deriving energy from the fungi and do not produce green leaves. At over 20kg, the largest seed is the coco de mer. [...] Plants that produce smaller seeds can generate many more seeds per flower, while plants with larger seeds invest more resources into those seeds and normally produce fewer seeds. Small seeds are quicker to ripen and can be dispersed sooner, so fall blooming plants often have small seeds. Many annual plants produce great quantities of smaller seeds; this helps to ensure at least a few will end in a favorable place for growth. [...] <b>Herbaceous</b> <b>perennials</b> and woody plants often have larger seeds; they can produce seeds over many years, and larger seeds have more energy reserves for germination and seedling growth and produce larger, more established seedlings after germination.|$|E

60|$|The {{garden was}} full of things that people dream about doing in their gardens and mostly never do. There was a rose garden all {{blooming}} in chorus, and with pillar-roses and arches that were not so much growths as overflowing cornucopias of roses, and a neat orchard with shapely trees white-painted to their exact middles, a stone wall bearing clematis and a clothes-line so gay with Mr. Brumley's blue and white flannel shirts that it seemed {{an essential part of}} the design. And then there was a great border of <b>herbaceous</b> <b>perennials</b> backed by delphiniums and monkshood already in flower and budding hollyhocks rising to their duty; a border that reared its blaze of colour against a hill-slope dark with pines. There was no hedge whatever to this delightful garden. It seemed to go straight into the pine-woods; only an invisible netting marked its limits and fended off the industrious curiosity of the rabbits.|$|E
60|$|And {{at length}} her {{penultimate}} day in Morningside Park dawned for her. She got up early, and walked about {{the garden in}} the dewy June sunshine and revived her childhood. She was saying good-bye to childhood and home, and her making; she was going out into the great, multitudinous world; this time {{there would be no}} returning. She {{was at the end of}} girlhood and on the eve of a woman's crowning experience. She visited the corner that had been her own little garden--her forget-me-nots and candytuft had long since been elbowed into insignificance by weeds; she visited the raspberry-canes that had sheltered that first love affair with the little boy in velvet, and the greenhouse where she had been wont to read her secret letters. Here was the place behind the shed where she had used to hide from Roddy's persecutions, and here the border of <b>herbaceous</b> <b>perennials</b> under whose stems was fairyland. The back of the house had been the Alps for climbing, and the shrubs in front of it a Terai. The knots and broken pale that made the garden-fence scalable, and gave access to the fields behind, were still to be traced. And here against a wall were the plum-trees. In spite of God and wasps and her father, she had stolen plums; and once because of discovered misdeeds, and once because she had realized that her mother was dead, she had lain on her face in the unmown grass, beneath the elm-trees that came beyond the vegetables, and poured out her soul in weeping.|$|E
