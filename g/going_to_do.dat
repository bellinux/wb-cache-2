5|$|Maybe mid-year; {{safe to say}} {{towards the}} end {{but not at the}} end, maybe like eight months or {{something}} like that. Best thing about it is we’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it whenever we want to do it. There is no deadline right now, we don’t have any dates set, we don’t have the studio, we’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the record ourselves. So we will literally go in and record it and it will be probably be done before we sign a contract.|$|E
5|$|I {{spend my}} time out in the open, on the shingle beach {{when the weather is}} bad or the fishing boats go out, or I go into the {{countryside}} which is very beautiful here, that I find perhaps still more charming in winter than in summer and, naturally I work all the time, and I believe that this year I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> some serious things.|$|E
5|$|Men, I know you’ve {{all been}} waiting to learn what this cruise is about, and why we’re still headed southeast. Now, at last, I {{can tell you that}} we are going on the voyage which all submariners have dreamed of ever since they possessed the means of doing so. We have the ship and we have the crew. We’re going around the world, nonstop. And we’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it entirely submerged.|$|E

5|$|Taking a {{page out}} of Chazz Palminteri's A Bronx Tale, Rosenbaum ignored the script during his final scene with Kristin Kreuk {{for the season}} six finale. Here, as Lana is informing Lex that {{she is going to}} leave, Lex walks around her and closes the door to her exit. Rosenbaum was trying to invoke a moment of fright for the {{audience}}. To the actor, he wanted the audience to wonder what Lex was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to Lana; it was a moment meant to show just how unpredictable Lex can be.|$|E
5|$|The book {{identifies}} {{a corporate}} underpinning influencing public opinion {{by way of}} companies which derive profit from the fossil fuel industry. Washington and Cook write that politicians often use weasel words {{as a form of}} spin and propaganda, in order to act as if they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something about climate change, while in actuality remaining passive on the issue. The authors go on to identify a greater level of denial— within the wider public itself. They argue that society enables denial of climate science through inaction and resistance to the scientific consensus. The authors conclude that if the public stopped denying climate change, the problem itself could realistically be significantly addressed.|$|E
5|$|When Echo & the Bunnymen {{entered the}} studio to record What Are You <b>Going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> with Your Life?, bassist Les Pattinson {{received}} news {{that his mother was}} unwell. That, coupled with Pattinson's perception that McCulloch wanted everything his way, led to Pattinson announcing his retirement from the band. McCulloch and guitarist Will Sergeant were determined to continue as Echo & the Bunnymen and recruited session musicians so they could record the album. The album was produced by Alan Douglas and Echo & the Bunnymen and was recorded at Doghouse Studios in Henley-on-Thames, Parr Street Studios in Liverpool, and Olympic Studios, Maida Vale Studios and CTS in London.|$|E

5|$|Andy assembles three applicants: a {{bodybuilder}} from Oscar Martinez's (Oscar Nunez) gym, Dwight's building handyman Nate (Mark Proksch), and a PhD {{candidate who}} can only work {{two days a}} week. Darryl demands anew to be fired, then switches gears: he tells Andy {{to give him the}} manager job, saying he deserves it and wants that or a pink slip. Andy then steps up and bluntly tells Darryl he not only is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that, but Darryl was not even the runner-up to Andy in the selection process. As he brings up Darryl's short temper, his hiring of the unqualified Glenn, and his loss of interest in taking business education courses, Darryl finally snaps out of his funk and listens to him. Andy tells Darryl that Jo Bennett loved him and saw something in him, and he simply stopped striving after that. He convinces Darryl to stay on board, and Darryl says he will assemble a new warehouse staff using a combination of his picks and one or two of Andy's applicants.|$|E
5|$|The marshall's moans of pain get worse, {{disturbing}} the other survivors. Eventually he asks to see Kate alone, {{and when she}} enters the tent, the marshal asks what Kate {{wanted to ask him}} before he was knocked unconscious during the crash. Kate tells him she wants to make sure Ray gets his reward. The marshal laughs, telling Kate that she is one of a kind, and then asks if he is going to die. Kate nods, and he asks if she is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. As Kate leaves, Sawyer enters with the gun, and a gunshot is heard. Jack becomes angry but Sawyer claims that the marshal asked to be killed. Muffled coughs are then heard, and it is revealed that Sawyer's shot missed the marshal's heart and pierced his lung, causing him more pain. Jack then euthanizes the marshal, presumably by suffocating him.|$|E
5|$|While {{sharing a}} bottle of wine with Gail, Lewis tries to kiss her. He later {{introduces}} her to his friend, Patrick (Simon Rouse), and pretends to turn down a job opportunity in Italy because he loves her. Lewis pays Patrick for his help and tells him that Gail ruined his life, so he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the same to her. Lewis and Gail grow closer and begin dating in secret, although Lewis resists taking things further because of his feelings for Audrey. Lewis attempts to drive a wedge between Gail and her family, before telling her that he has been offered a new life in Italy, running a small hotel. Lewis asks Gail to come with him and she agrees. Audrey is devastated when she learns about their relationship, after catching them together. Gail takes out a £40,000 loan against her house to fund her trip to Italy, which Lewis plans on taking. He overhears Kylie speaking about a one-night stand she had with Nick and blackmails her into getting Gail's bank account password for him. Gail gathers her family together to tell them about Italy, but Lewis does not turn up. He instructs them by text message to watch a DVD he has made detailing his revenge plan. He reveals that he has taken Gail's money and that he deeply loved Audrey. The police later inform Gail that Lewis fled to Belize.|$|E

25|$|Daniel Isenberg's 1984 {{study of}} senior {{managers}} {{found that their}} decisions were highly intuitive.

25|$|The {{inevitable}} {{combat and}} chase sequences in the James Bond theme are handled by Action Rounds, representing 3–5 seconds of time.

Speed also affects how many attacks a character may make in a round.|$|E
