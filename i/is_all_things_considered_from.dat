40|$|Recent work {{shows an}} {{important}} asymmetry in lay intuitions about moral dilemmas. Most {{people think it}} is permissible to divert a train {{so that it will}} kill one innocent person instead of five, but most people think that it is not permissible to push a stranger in front of a train to save five innocents. We argue that recent emotion-based explanations of this asymmetry have neglected the contribution that rules make to reasoning about moral dilemmas. In two experiments, we find that participants show a parallel asymmetry about versions of the dilemmas that have minimized emotional force. In a third experiment, we find that people distinguish between whether an action violates a moral rule and whether it <b>is,</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>considered,</b> wrong. We propose that judgments of whether an action <b>is</b> wrong, <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>considered,</b> implicate a complex set of psychological processes, including representations of rules, emotional responses, and assessments of costs and benefits. q 2005 Published by Elsevier B.

40|$|Looking at I Am Love [Io sonno l’amore] (2009), a film by Luca Guadagnino, {{in light}} of three {{possible}} genre categories: the family melodrama, the “melodrama of the unknown woman” (Cavell 1996) and the contemporary melodrama, I verify in what ways it deviates from the Italian film tradition to represent a new social paradigm (contemporary and capitalist), {{at the same time}} as it pertains to a cinematic matrix that <b>is,</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>considered,</b> that of North American classical melodrama. Exploring the identity-questioning device provided in the title through a (self-) metonymic effect (“I am love”), my major topics for analysis and cornerstones in the representation of the film’s protagonist — Emma, an “unknown woman” — are the dilution and refinement of individual boundaries, the problems of recognition and non-recognition, or of self-affirmation and repression among society, and the process of naming in its ontological, literary and cinematic repercussions. These will also function as references to the melodramatic mode itself in cinema, from a classical Hollywood paradigm to a contemporary and international — critically independent — appropriation and recycling of the genre. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|ArticleIt {{has been}} claimed, most emphatically by transhumanists, that {{individual}} {{death is the}} greatest evil and that we therefore need {{to do everything we}} can to defeat the disease of human senescence and mortality. In other words, we need to kill death. I have argued elsewhere that we actually benefit from death and that death <b>is,</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>considered,</b> not an evil at all. However, in this paper, I am not disputing the claim that death is an evil. Instead, I suggest that it can only be an evil for us if we understand our existence as separate from all other existence, which is by no means inevitable. The independent, autonomous self whose annihilation we fear is the product of a particular self–conception, a particular way of seeing ourselves in relation to others. There is an alternative. If we understand our own lives as prolonged and extended in the life that surrounds us, then our own individual death loses its significance. When life is shared and being understood as shared, then there is no need to kill death...|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} report, I question the moral justification of bureaucracy. After pointing out some arguments {{in favour of}} bureaucracy and some teleological, or result-based, arguments against bureaucracy, I {{pay particular attention to}} deontological, or process-based, moral arguments against bureaucracy. The two main arguments against bureaucracy that I address are (1) that bureaucracies constitute unfair decision making procedures in democratic societies, and (2) that bureaucracies treat their participants (both clients and workers) disrespectfully. I then give some suggestions of what a promising alternative to bureaucracy might look like, based on the two main arguments against bureaucracy that I consider. Ultimately, I conclude that it is still an open question whether bureaucracy is morally justified, but that my research brings to the fore some serious moral problems with bureaucracy that are worth taking note of. Even {{if it turns out that}} the results of bureaucratic organisation are so beneficial that bureaucracy <b>is,</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>considered,</b> justified, the moral problems that I point out in {{this research}} are worth serious consideration...|$|R

40|$|Democratic local {{community}} <b>is,</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>considered,</b> something good of which England, in particular, should have more. This {{is not a}} proposition that has been given much attention in academic 'Political Theory'; nor has it played very much part in informing the practice of twentieth century English governance. Nevertheless, there is academic work (theoretical and empirical) across a number of disciplines, some of it less well known, which is supportive of the claim, and which can be brought together into a comprehensive argument which can rebut most commonly-voiced objections. That argument, set out in this thesis, concludes {{that a number of}} factors aid the healthy development of democratic {{local community}}, but that the most significant involve the structure of local government. A central element of that structure is scale: it is argued that while all community-based local government is valuable, small "human scale" communities of 5, 000 - 10, 000 adults are particularly important for expressing values relating to local community and democracy. The conclusions of the thesis are contrasted with the policies of recent UK governments - including David Cameron's "Big Society" - which have typically been inimical to the role of democratic local community in English government and society.
