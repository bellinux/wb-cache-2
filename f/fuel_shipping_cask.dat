50|$|When {{a nuclear}} fuel {{assembly}} {{is prepared for}} onsite storage, it is dried {{and moved to a}} spent nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>shipping</b> <b>cask</b> with scores of other assemblies. Then it sits on a concrete pad {{for a number of years}} waiting for an intermediate storage facility or reprocessing. The transportation of radiation-damaged cladding is tricky, because it is so fragile. After being removed from the reactor and cooling down in the spent fuel pool, the hydrides within the cladding of an assembly reorient themselves so that they radially point out from the fuel, rather than circularly in the direction of the hoop stress. This puts the fuel in a situation so that when it is moved to its final resting place, if the cask were to fall, the cladding would be so weak it could break and release the spent fuel pellets inside the cask.|$|E

40|$|The Nuclear Regulatory Commission {{is seeking}} public comment {{on a study}} of how a truck cask for {{transporting}} spent nuclear fuel might perform in a severe tunnel fire. The report models {{the performance of the}} NAC International Model LWT (NAC) spent fuel cask under the conditions of the April 1982 fire in the Caldecott highway tunnel near Oakland, Calif., when a gasoline tanker carrying 8, 800 gallons of gasoline overturned and caught fire. Severe, intense fires such as the Caldecott fire are extremely rare. However, they provide an opportunity to study how transportation packages might perform under very severe accident conditions. The results of this study strongly indicate that any radioactive release from the NAC model or a similar spent <b>fuel</b> <b>shipping</b> <b>cask</b> involved in a severe tunnel fire such as that of the Caldecott highway tunnel accident would be within regulatory limits. The peak internal temperatures predicted for the NAC cask in the analysis of the Caldecott fire scenario were not high enough to result in rupture of the fuel cladding (protective metal tubing around the fuel). Therefore, it would not be expected that any radioactive material (including spent nuclear fuel particles or fission products) would be released from the fuel rods.

CALCULATION METHOD I ASSUMPTIONS Method: The calculation will utilize typical radiant heat transfer formulas to determine the radiant heat flux of the burning tires. Assumptions: 1. From Ref. 1 (a typical heavy haul trailer), use trailer tire size 255 / 70 R x 22. 5 16 PR Radials. These tires are 10 in. wide x 36. 5 in. high. Therefore, a double axle set of dual tires will be approximately 1 m high x 1 m wide x 3 m long. 2. Use heat release rate of 1500 kW/m 2 for burning tires. This is conservative based on similar fuels listed in Table 5 - 5. 2 (a) of Reference 3. 3. Assume closest set of axles on trailer to shipping cask bum to calculate part 2.

40|$|A crush pad {{has been}} {{designed}} and analyzed to absorb the kinetic energy of a hypothetically dropped spent nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>shipping</b> <b>cask</b> into a 44 -ft. deep cask unloading pool at the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant. The 110 -ton Large Cell Cask {{was assumed to be}} accidentally dropped onto the parapet of the unloading pool, causing the cask to tumble through the pool water and impact the floor mounted crush pad with the cask`s top corner. The crush pad contains rigid polyurethane foam, which was modeled in a separate computer analysis to simulate the manufacturer`s testing of the foam and to determine the foam`s stress and strain characteristics. This computer analysis verified that the foam was accurately represented in the analysis to follow. A detailed non-linear, dynamic finite element analysis was then performed on the crush pad and adjacent pool structure to assure that a drop of this massive cask does not result in unacceptable damage to the storage facility. Additionally, verification was made that the crush pad adequately protects the cask from severe impact loading. At impact, the cask has significant vertical, horizontal and rotational velocities. The crush pad absorbs much of the energy of the cask through plastic deformation during primary and secondary impacts. After the primary impact with the crush pad, the cask still has sufficient energy to rebound and rotate until it impacts the pool wall. An assessment is made of the damage to the crush pad and pool wall and of the impact loading on the cask...|$|E
40|$|A crush pad {{has been}} {{designed}} and analyzed to absorb the kinetic energy of an accidentally dropped spent nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>shipping</b> <b>cask</b> into a 44 ft. deep cask unloading pool. Conventional analysis techniques available for evaluating a cask for tipping due to lateral seismic forces assume that the cask rests on a rigid surface. In this analysis, the cask (110 tons) sits on a stainless steel encased (0. 25 in. top plate), polyurethane foam (4 ft. thick) crush pad. As the cask tends to rock due to horizontal seismic forces, the contact area between the cask and the crush pad is reduced, increasing the bearing stress, and causing the pivoting corner of the cask to depress into the crush pad. As the crush pad depresses under the cask corner, the pivot point shifts from the corner toward the cask center, which facilitates rocking and potential tipping of the cask. Subsequent rocking of the cask may deepen the depression, further contributing to the likelihood of cask tip over. However, as the depression is created, the crush pad is absorbing energy from the rocking cask. Potential tip over of the cask was evaluated by performing a non-linear, dynamic, finite element analysis with acceleration time history input. This time history analysis captured {{the effect of a}} deforming crush pad, and also eliminated conservatisms of the conventional approaches. For comparison purposes, this analysis was also performed with the cask sitting on a solid stainless steel crush pad. Results indicate that the conventional methods are quite conservative relative to the more exacting time history analysis. They also indicate that the rocking motion is less on the foam crush pad than on the solid stainless steel pad...|$|E
