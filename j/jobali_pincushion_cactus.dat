5000|$|The first {{species was}} {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus as Cactus mammillaris in 1753, deriving its name from Latin mammilla, [...] "nipple", referring to the tubercles that are among the distinctive features of the genus. In 1812, the cactus specialist Adrian Haworth described the genus Mammillaria to contain this and related species. Numerous species {{are commonly known as}} globe cactus, nipple cactus, fishhook <b>cactus</b> or <b>pincushion</b> <b>cactus</b> though such terms may also be used for related taxa, particularly Escobaria.|$|R
50|$|Pediocactus bradyi is a {{rare species}} of cactus known by the common names Brady's <b>pincushion</b> <b>cactus,</b> Brady's {{hedgehog}} cactus, and Marble Canyon cactus. It is endemic to Arizona in the USA, where it is restricted to Marble Canyon in Coconino County.

This has been a federally listed endangered species of the United States since 1979.|$|R
50|$|Pediocactus sileri is a {{rare species}} of cactus known by the common names Siler's <b>pincushion</b> <b>cactus</b> and gypsum cactus (or gypsum plains cactus).

This is a federally listed threatened species of the United States.|$|R
50|$|Mammillaria spinosissima, {{also known}} as spiny <b>pincushion</b> <b>cactus,</b> are {{cylindrical}} plants that grow up to 30 cm tall and 10 cm wide. They reach full height after five to ten years. The spines are red-brown or white, with cream-colored radials and pink, funnel-shaped flowers that grow in a ring around {{the apex of the}} stem to approximately 2 cm long. The relatively small cacti are globular or elongated, and the flowers produce generally bright red berries that are club-shaped, smooth, and juicy.|$|R
50|$|Escobaria robbinsiorum (syn. Coryphantha robbinsiorum) is a {{rare species}} of cactus known by the common names Cochise <b>pincushion</b> <b>cactus</b> and Cochise foxtail cactus. It is native to {{southern}} Arizona in the United States, where it is known only from Cochise County, and northern Sonora in Mexico. There are scattered small occurrences {{on the north side}} of the border, and one known population to the south. Because of its rarity and a number of threats to remaining plants, the species was federally listed with a threatened status in 1986.|$|R
50|$|This plant {{grows on}} exposed {{stretches}} of gravelly clay, including alluvial benches above floodplains and on mesa slopes. Nearby rivers include the Green, Colorado and Gunnison Rivers. It {{is part of}} saltbush and sagebrush-dominated desert shrub plant communities, or pinyon-juniper woodlands. Other plants in the habitat include shadscale (Atriplex confertifolia), galleta (Hilaria jamesii), black sagebrush (Artemisia nova), Indian rice grass (Stipa hymenoides), strawberry hedgehog cactus (Echinocereus triglochidiatus var. melanacanthus), Simpson's <b>pincushion</b> <b>cactus</b> (Pediocactus simpsonii), prickly pear cactus (Opuntia polyacantha), winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata), yucca (Yucca harrimaniae), snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), low rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus), sand dropseed (Sporobolus cryptandrus), and Salina wildrye (Leymus salinus).|$|R
50|$|Escobaria sneedii (syn. Coryphantha sneedii) is a {{rare species}} of cactus known by the common names Sneed's <b>pincushion</b> <b>cactus</b> and carpet foxtail cactus. It is native to the Chihuahuan Desert, where it occurs in {{scattered}} locations in New Mexico, Texas, and Chihuahua. Some plants occurring in Arizona may be included within this species. Botanical authors do not necessarily agree on the circumscription of this species. Most will agree {{at this point in}} the research, however, that there are two varieties of Escobaria sneedii, and that both are rare and endangered. The plant is popular with cactus enthusiasts and dealers because of its often petite size and tolerance for moderately cold climates. They have been overharvested from their natural habitat, the main reason why the two varieties, var. sneedii and var. leei, have been federally listed as endangered and threatened, respectively.|$|R
50|$|The {{plant was}} {{discovered}} in 1966 near Last Chance Creek south of the Fremont Junction in Utah. Today there are 15 known occurrences in Sevier, Wayne, and Emery Counties {{for a total of}} about 6000 plants. Some occurrences are in the San Rafael Swell and there is one in Capitol Reef National Park. The plants occur in sparsely vegetated openings in pinyon-juniper woodland habitat. They are generally restricted to pockets of shale lens soils surrounded by less hospitable soil types. The shale soil is derived from the Mancos Formation and is silty and alkaline. Other plants in the habitat include blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), black sagebrush (Artemisia nova), shadscale (Atriplex confertifolia), and snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae). Other rare plants in the area include Despain's <b>pincushion</b> <b>cactus</b> (Pediocactus despainii), Wright's fishhook cactus (Sclerocactus wrightiae), and Barneby reed-mustard (Schoenocrambe barnebyi).|$|R

50|$|Mammillaria morganiana, {{common name}} Owl’s eyes or Owl-eye <b>pincushion,</b> is a <b>cactus</b> in the genus Mammillaria {{belonging}} to the family Cactaceae. The epithet morganiana honors the U.S. optometrists Meredith WalterMorgan (1887-1957) of Richmond.|$|R
40|$|Pediocactus simpsonii var. robustior {{is a small}} {{single or}} {{clustered}} cactus with globe-like stems that may be flattened on the top. The stems are 2 to 4 in. (7 - 12 cm) thick with tubercles (fleshy nodules) 1 / 2 to 1 in. (1. 5 - 2. 5 cm) long in 8 - 13 spiral rows. The 8 - 12 straight, central spines are yellowish to reddish-brown and 1 / 2 to 1 1 / 8 in. (1. 5 - 2. 8 cm) long, while the 10 - 30 marginal spines are smaller and whitish. The yellowish-green to purple flowers are 1 / 2 to in. (1. 5 - 2 cm) long, and the rounded fruits are to 1 / 3 in. (6 - 8 mm) long. The seeds are black and about 1 / 8 in. (3 mm) long. Identification Tips: This variety of Pediocactus simpsonii is the only <b>pincushion</b> <b>cactus</b> that is found in Washington. The only other cacti that are found in Washington are in the genus Opuntia (prickly-pear) and are not easily confused with Pediocactus. Opuntia have distinctly flattened stems, while species of Pediocactus are quite globular. Phenology: This taxon blooms from May through July in Washington. Range: Pedicactus simpsonii var. robustior ranges from eastern Washington to Nevada, and {{has been found in}} Yakima, Kittitas...|$|R
50|$|Mammillaria parkinsonii, {{also known}} as owl-eye <b>pincushion</b> or owl-eye <b>cactus,</b> is a species of {{flowering}} plant in the Cactaceae family. It is endemic to Queretaro, Mexico. Mammillaria parkinsonii is listed as Endangered due to a limited distribution (extent of occurrence ca 2,500 km2), severe fragmentation, a continuing decline due to illegal collection, and degradation of its habitat across its range. Clarification of the taxonomic status of this species is a research priority.|$|R
