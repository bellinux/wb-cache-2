Bentley's response was tentative, but after being assured that the setlist consisted mostly of tracks from How Could Hell Be Any Worse?, he agreed to return for one show, and ended up staying on because he <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun.</b> A freshly rehabilitated Gurewitz was eventually convinced to come back aboard, and with Pete Finestone returning on drums and Greg Hetson on second guitar; Bad Religion was back.

When re-recording songs for Irreemplazable, Beyoncé's vocal coach provided the Spanish lyrics phonetically, and each line was recorded up to four times for the EP. Beyoncé has stated that she intends to take up Spanish lessons in the future. She said of the EP's recording, [...] "This is such an honor {{for me to be}} able to connect with all my fans.

It gives me the freedom to sing as powerfully as I want and to rewrite the songs specifically for the genre." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, who was critical of the song's original version, praised the [...] "Vintage Throwback Remix". He felt {{it was more of}} what the original [...] "should have been" [...] and concluded: [...] "a rousing vocal arrangement at the song's climax sells Mariah's inspirational message of perseverance and harks back to her '90s heyday." [...] Idolator's Becky Bain called the remix far more [...] "captivating" [...] than the original, and felt its re-recorded vocals showcased the singer's [...] "one-of-a-kind range." ...|$|E

[...] She also revealed that the video is supposed to reflect her simplistic childhood, adding: [...] "Growing up, I had really amazing parents and I had a great childhood. We went from nicer homes to being in apartments with our lights cutting off.

Guggenheim said: I've never <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> writing a script before ... It was such a blast to work on... I keep telling everyone that we should try for Avengers. It's these two heroes together with a big production value. ... There's the opportunity for inside jokes, and seeing all of the characters together. What happens when Cisco gets his eyes on Thea? There are moments like that, that you just can’t do in a normal episode....It's just so much fun. In October 2014, the title of The Flash episode was announced as [...] "Flash vs. Arrow".

500|$|In early May 1967, Taylor {{announced}} that Smile had been scrapped, but the Beach Boys were still under pressure and {{a contractual obligation}} to record and present an album to Capitol. On June 2, Brian declared to his bandmates {{that most of the}} material recorded for Smile was now off-limits. According to Carl, [...] "Brian just said, 'I can't do this. We're going to make a homespun version of it instead. We're just going to take it easy. I'll get in the pool and sing. Or let's go in the gym and do our parts.' That was Smiley Smile." [...] In interviews conducted over the next year, Brian intimated that he had run out of ideas [...] "in a conventional sense", and that he was [...] "about ready to die". He says: [...] "I decided not to try any more, and not try and do such great things ... And we <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun.</b> The Smiley Smile era was so great, it was unbelievable. Personally, spiritually, everything, it was great. I didn't have any paranoia feelings." [...] Carl described the end product as [...] "a bunt instead of a grand slam".|$|E
500|$|The {{series was}} {{originally}} {{designed as a}} star vehicle for Doherty, who portrayed Denise Johnson in the unaired pilot. Denise was Doherty's first role in a television sitcom. Doherty said that she loved the script for the pilot immediately, describing it as [...] "hysterical", but felt intimidated by the role given her inexperience with comedy. The series was marketed initially as featuring Doherty and Peete, before UPN {{announced that it would}} pick up the show on the condition that Doherty was removed and the character was recast. According to TV Guide, Doherty was poorly received by preview audiences. When queried by an interviewer about Doherty's removal from the show, executive producer Warren Littlefield said the actress was [...] "fabulous" [...] in the role. According to him, Doherty wanted to change her negative reputation after leaving Beverly Hills, 90210 and Charmed by acting on the show. Peete praised her performance saying [...] "we <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> and such a great vibe". UPN Entertainment's president cited the rationale behind Doherty's departure using the [...] "standard going-in-a-different-direction reason".

50|$|Barcelona {{was formed}} in 1998 by Korzen and Carr. The pair {{recruited}} Ramiscal and Scanniello and began writing and performing original songs that year. Later that year, the group met producer/engineer Trevor Kampmann (also known as Trevor Holland) and began work on its first LP, Simon Basic, which included the single Why Do You <b>Have</b> <b>So</b> <b>Much</b> <b>Fun</b> Without Me?.|$|R
500|$|The band began {{recording}} {{without much}} material {{and needed to}} compose songs on the spot, either by jamming or talking through ideas. Morrison enjoyed not having multiple takes, as on The Soft Parade, and showed up to the sessions on time and sober, unlike sessions for that album. The absence of Rothchild helped as he was a perfectionist who insisted on many takes. In 1994, guitarist Robby Krieger stated, [...] "Rothchild was gone, {{which is one reason}} why we <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun.</b> The warden was gone." [...] Despite its troubled beginnings, L.A. Woman contains some of the Doors' most critically acclaimed songs, {{as well as some of}} their most blues-oriented. Lyrically, it deals with contemporary topics such as love, life in Los Angeles, and complex aspects of the human experience. Manzarek explained the band did not [...] "approach the album with one vision, but after we started working on the songs, we realized that they're talking about L.A. They're about men, women, boys, girls, love, loss, lovers-lost, and lovers-found in Los Angeles". The album, as a whole, demonstrated Morrison's songwriting abilities, combined with his poetic phrasing and enthusiasm for Los Angeles, and a desire to leave the city with his partner, Pamela Courson. Artistically, L.A. Woman saw the band mixing blues, psychedelia, and jazz, often within a single song. For the first time since [...] "The End" [...] and [...] "When the Music's Over", the group incorporated longer songs, including [...] "L.A. Woman" [...] and [...] "Riders on the Storm".|$|E
500|$|When {{the band}} {{completed}} writing and recording demos for the songs, the three headed to Los Angeles to record drum tracks at Chick Corea's Mad Hatter Studios in January 1999. Barker recorded {{the majority of}} his drum tracks in eight hours. The recording process for the album was completed over a period of four months, and production was handled at several production facilities in southern California, including Signature Sound and Studio West in San Diego, Big Fish Studios in Encinitas, and Conway Recording Studios and The Bomb Factory in Los Angeles. For Barker, the album was [...] "fueled by black coffee and Marlboro Lights"; he was hopeful for the album as the band were well-rehearsed and no time would be wasted. To record Enema of the State, Blink-182 turned to punk rock producer Jerry Finn, who previously worked on Green Day's breakthrough album, Dookie (1994). Hoppus and DeLonge were impressed with his work when they recorded [...] "Mutt" [...] for its placement on the American Pie soundtrack. Finn was harder on the trio to record better takes, and Hoppus credited Finn with knowing a great deal about punk rock music, but also helping the band establish a more pop-inspired sound. Finn came with an array of amps, effects and equipments; previously the band were forced to rent such equipment. Barker kept attempting to irritate Finn by sneaking in vibraslaps, which Finn hated. In addition, the band <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> with Finn that there were days when very little work was accomplished: [...] "Recording can get pretty monotonous, but at least we could laugh with Jerry," [...] recalled Hoppus. [...] "A pretty typical day would involve multiple takes for one part of one song, and then everyone would get naked and jump on Jerry." [...] The band chose [...] "never to work with anyone else again," [...] and Finn would produce their next three releases.|$|E
500|$|Rebecca Mader's {{audition}} {{scene was}} a fake flashback {{and she was}} disappointed {{that it was not}} used for the show. [...] The character's name was spoiled months in advance of broadcast. [...] Charlotte was originally envisioned as an American; however, the writers preferred Mader's natural English accent to her fake American accent and they changed Charlotte accordingly. [...] Losts writer-producers compared Mader to [...] "a young Nicole Kidman". [...] During the casting process, Charlotte was described as a [...] "successful academic". [...] It was falsely rumored that Kristen Bell was offered the role of Charlotte; Bell had actually spoken to the producers about having a part; however, no role was offered to her. [...] Despite never having seen Lost, Mader decided that she [...] "was not going to leave [...] room until [...] made [...] fall in love with [...] ". [...] Mader subsequently began to watch the first three seasons of Lost and was watching the fourth episode when she received the news that she had been chosen for the role. [...] In the next two to three weeks, Mader– who was then signed on as a recurring guest star– watched the rest of the first three seasons, watching the third season finale a matter of hours before she began shooting her first [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] scene, in which Charlotte meets Locke and his group. [...] Mader was told little about her character by the writer-producers, except that [...] "she was sort of like a female Indiana Jones type". [...] Mader has found it challenging but fun to play a character with an unknown backstory and motives. [...] Charlotte's full name is Charlotte Staples Lewis, which is an homage to the author C.S. Lewis, best known for The Chronicles of Narnia and various books about Christianity. [...] Lewis was one of Mader's favorite authors as a child and found it [...] "wicked" [...] and [...] "cool" [...] for her character to be named after him. [...] Mader also enjoyed that she only requires a small amount of hair and makeup done, saying that [...] "I just wanted to rough it. [...] I wanted to roll around in the mud with a gun." [...] Mader claims that she has [...] "never <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> in [...] life" [...] as when she is shooting Lost. In the episode, Charlotte's birthday is said to be July 2, 1979. This led to a minor continuity error in the fifth season episode [...] "LaFleur", when Charlotte is depicted as being a little girl in 1974. Executive producers Cuse and Lindelof claimed in a podcast that the original script for [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] listed Charlotte's birthday as being in 1970 and that Mader had it changed because she did not want people to think she was significantly older than she actually is. This caused a controversy when Mader later stated on her blog that Gregg Nations, the script coordinator, was the one who suggested the change. Cuse and Lindelof later conceded that she was right.|$|E
