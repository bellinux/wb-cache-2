60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shivered</b> a little. I {{could not}} help feeling the cold {{repression}} of the place. A vision of thin, grey-gowned figures, with pallid faces and weary, discontented eyes, haunted me. I tried to fancy Isobel amongst them. It was preposterous.|$|E

60|$|Contemplating him <b>I</b> <b>shivered</b> {{a little}} and felt thankful that he was dead.
