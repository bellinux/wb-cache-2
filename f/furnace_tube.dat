50|$|The {{difficulties}} of the Cornish boiler were that a boiler of any particular power would require a known area of <b>furnace</b> <b>tube</b> as the heating area. Longer tubes required a longer and more expensive boiler shell. They also reduced the ratio of grate area relative to the heating area, {{making it difficult to}} maintain an adequate fire. Increasing the tube diameter reduced the depth of water covering the <b>furnace</b> <b>tube</b> and so increased the need for accurate control of water level by the fireman, or else the risk of boiler explosion. Fairbairn's studies of hoop stress in cylinders also showed that smaller tubes were stronger than larger tubes. His solution was simple: to replace one large <b>furnace</b> <b>tube</b> with two smaller ones.|$|E
50|$|Typical {{applications}} include: High temperature press platens used in {{superplastic forming}} of titanium, high temperature industrial furnace hardware and petrochemical <b>furnace</b> <b>tube</b> supports.|$|E
50|$|Temperature is {{important}} for several reasons. High temperature (in excess of 1100 °C) introduces greater safety issues. It also risks uneven heating in the chamber {{that can lead to}} problems with uniformity. If water vapor is generated at very high temperatures, it must be cooled before coming in contact with the furnace and wafers. Variation in temperature across the <b>furnace</b> <b>tube</b> can cause problems in uniformity.|$|E

5000|$|An {{example of}} a {{material}} prepared using a <b>tube</b> <b>furnace</b> is the superconductor YBa2Cu3O7. A mixture of finely powdered CuO, BaO, and Y2O3, in the appropriate molar ratio, contained in a platinum or alumina [...] "boat," [...] is heated in a <b>tube</b> <b>furnace</b> at several hundred degrees under flowing oxygen. Similarly tantalum disulfide is prepared in a <b>tube</b> <b>furnace</b> followed by purification, also in a <b>tube</b> <b>furnace</b> using the technique of chemical vapor transport. Because {{of the availability of}} <b>tube</b> <b>furnaces,</b> chemical vapor transport has become a popular technique not only in industry (see van Arkel process) but also in the research laboratory.|$|R
30|$|Currently, {{the manual}} method using {{hand-held}} infrared temperature measurement instruments for measuring temperatures on the external surfaces of ethylene cracking <b>furnace</b> <b>tubes</b> is highly subjective and {{is affected by}} a number of prominent issues, such as the high temperature working environments, which leads to low efficiency and poor measurement accuracy. Hence, an automatic temperature measurement system based on infrared light is designed and realized. In the system, a dual-phase drive synchronization method is proposed to rotate the thermodetector during horizontal movements, thus realizing automatic batch temperature measurements of the <b>furnace</b> <b>tubes.</b> Moreover, a temperature processing algorithm is developed to automatically identify <b>furnace</b> wall and <b>tube</b> surface temperatures, filter out abnormal temperatures and select only high-quality temperature measurements prior to calculating the final result. Real temperature measurement experiments demonstrated that the dual-phase drive temperature measurement system and temperature processing method are effective and efficient. Compared with the traditional manual way, temperatures obtained using the proposed system are more stable and accurate.|$|R
5000|$|These were not, however, return-flue boilers in {{the sense}} used here, but rather return-tube boilers. They had a single large {{cylindrical}} <b>furnace</b> <b>tube,</b> a combustion chamber external to the boiler's pressure shell, then multiple, narrow fire-tubes returning to a horseshoe-shaped smokebox above and around the firedoor. The proximity of this smokebox to the fireman led to their nickname of [...] "belly burners". Their design thus has {{more in common with}} the horizontal launch-type boilers (as used by Sir Arthur Heywood) or the Scotch marine boiler than they do with the simple single-flue boiler.|$|E
50|$|Package boilers are {{commonly}} called water or fire tube Boilers. Water tube boilers use convection heating, which draws {{the heat from}} the fire source, and passes against the generating tubes of the boiler, causing water inside those tubes to boil off into steam. The fire tube boiler arrangement utilizes conduction heating which transfers heat from physical contact. Fire tube boilers are not commonly used due to their method of conduction heating because pipes in direct contact with fire and cold water could damage the pipes. The package boiler is usually a two or three-pass fire-tube boiler with an internal <b>furnace</b> <b>tube.</b> This is similar to the much earlier Scotch boiler.|$|E
50|$|The firebox is {{of limited}} size though, {{and unlike the}} {{locomotive}} boiler cannot expand beyond {{the size of the}} boiler shell. This limits the sustained output that is possible. The grate and ashpan are also limited in size, the grate being a set of bars part-way across the <b>furnace</b> <b>tube</b> and the ashpan the restricted space beneath this. These features limit the boiler's ability to burn hard bituminous coal and they require a supply of Welsh steam coal, or similar, instead. Firebox capacity is further restricted by the space used for the ashpan and also by the dry-back furnace. The small ashpan also restricts their ability to steam for long periods.|$|E
5000|$|The term coil (or furnace) {{visbreaking}} {{is applied}} to units where the cracking process occurs in the <b>furnace</b> <b>tubes</b> (or [...] "coils"). Material exiting the furnace is quenched to halt the cracking reactions: frequently this is achieved by heat exchange with the virgin material being fed to the furnace, {{which in turn is}} a good energy efficiency step, but sometimes a stream of cold oil (usually gas oil) is used to the same effect. The gas oil is recovered and re-used. The extent of the cracking reaction is controlled by regulation of the speed of flow of the oil through the <b>furnace</b> <b>tubes.</b> The quenched oil then passes to a fractionator where the products of the cracking (gas, LPG, gasoline, gas oil and tar) are separated and recovered.|$|R
30|$|The {{temperature}} measurement system proposed {{in this paper}} was applied to an ethylene plant cracking furnace of a large petrochemical company. The ethylene plant has several cracking furnaces, {{each of which has}} eight watching-fire holes and 96 <b>furnace</b> <b>tubes,</b> therefore, 12 tubes can be observed through each hole. To test the effectiveness of the proposed method, two aspects of real measurement experiments were carried out and the results were analyzed.|$|R
25|$|Fused quartz, {{also called}} fused-silica glass, vitreous-silica glass: silica (SiO2) in vitreous, or glass, form (i.e., its {{molecules}} are disordered and random, without crystalline structure). It has very low thermal expansion, is very hard, and resists high temperatures (1000–1500°C). It {{is also the}} most resistant against weathering (caused in other glasses by alkali ions leaching out of the glass, while staining it). Fused quartz is used for high-temperature applications such as <b>furnace</b> <b>tubes,</b> lighting tubes, melting crucibles, etc.|$|R
50|$|A {{limitation}} of this design for steam locomotives was the need to fit fire, grate and ashpan all within the confined circular <b>furnace</b> <b>tube.</b> This limited the radiative heating surface of the furnace, and thus the immediate steam-raising power of the boiler. They were noted as being slower to light from cold than conventional. As the ashpan space beneath the grate was small, locomotives could only operate {{for a short time}} before needing to rake out this ashpan. On a main line railway this would have required a return to the engine shed. On small narrow gauge contractor lines, the ash would simply be dumped wherever convenient and so this was much less of a drawback.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{recorded}} boiler of comparable form {{was used in}} a railway locomotive, Hackworth's [...] 'Wilberforce' [...] class of 1830. This had a long cylindrical boiler shell similar to his earlier return-flued [...] 'Royal George' , but with the return flue replaced {{by a number of}} small firetubes, as had been demonstrated so effectively by Stephenson with his [...] 'Rocket' [...] a year earlier. The novel feature of an entirely internal combustion chamber was used. Unlike the later Scotch boiler though, this was self-supported by its own stays, rather than using stays through the walls of the boiler shell. This allowed the entire assembly of outer tubeplate, <b>furnace</b> <b>tube,</b> combustion chamber and firetubes to all be removed from the boiler shell as one unit, simplifying manufacture and maintenance. Although a valuable feature, this became impractical for larger diameter chambers that would require the support of the shell.|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the technical progress achieved {{during the first}} quarter of the ERIP project entitled, ``Laser Ultrasonic <b>Furnace</b> <b>Tube</b> Coke Monitor. `` The focus of work during this reporting period was the testing of a novel device for introducing a broad bandwidth ultrasonic pulse at the surface of a simulated <b>furnace</b> <b>tube.</b> The device employs a sacrificial stand-off composed of a fusible alloy that conforms to hot <b>furnace</b> <b>tube</b> surface upon contact. Conventional high-temperature couplants have a maximum operating temperature of about 550 {degrees}C, which limits their use for contact against ethylene cracker <b>furnace</b> <b>tube</b> surfaces that typically operate at about 1000 {degrees}C. In the absence of a couplant, insufficient ultrasonic energy can be transmitted from the transducer to the tube surface. By using a fusible alloy, the device efficiently couples the transducer to the hot <b>furnace</b> <b>tube</b> surface, even for rough and convex tube surfaces operating at temperatures of 1800 {degrees}F and above.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to use {{numerical}} analysis and fine element method-FEM to investigate the influence of <b>furnace</b> <b>tube</b> shape on the thermal strain of fire-tube boilers. Thermal stresses in corrugated furnace tubes of different shape, i. e. with different corrugation pitch and depth, were analysed first. It was demonstrated that the thermal stresses in corrugated <b>furnace</b> <b>tube</b> are significantly reduced with the increase of corrugation depth. Than deformations and stresses in the structure of a fire-tube boiler were analysed in a real operating condition, for the cases of installed plain <b>furnace</b> <b>tube</b> and corrugated furnace tubes with different shapes. It was concluded that in this fire-tube boiler, which is of larger steam capacity, the corrugated <b>furnace</b> <b>tube</b> must be installed, as well as that the maximal stress in the construction is reduced by the installation of the <b>furnace</b> <b>tube</b> with greater corrugation depth. The analysis of stresses due to pressure and thermal loads pointed out that thermal stresses are not lower-order stresses in comparison to stresses due to pressure loads, so they must be taken into consideration for boiler strength analysis.

40|$|Abstract 25 Cr 35 NiNb+MA alloy {{is widely}} used in {{ethylene}} pyrolysis <b>furnace</b> <b>tube,</b> the highest service temperature can be 1100 °C, and has high resistance to creep and carburization. Ethylene pyrolysis <b>furnace</b> <b>tube</b> will suffer carburizing during service, which lead to phase transformation. Phase transformation of 25 Cr 35 NiNb+MA heat-resistant ethylene pyrolysis <b>furnace</b> <b>tube</b> was investigated after service and the Nb transition during service was discussed. The phase transformation of ethylene pyrolysis <b>furnace</b> <b>tube</b> was characterized with field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectrum (EDS). Results reveal that the microstructure of as-cast 25 Cr 35 NiNb+MA alloy contains NbC carbides on the dendrite boundaries. During service at high temperature, the NbC carbides transform to blocky G-phase (Ni 16 Nb 6 Si 7) between M 23 C 6 and matrix. As the carburizing process occurs, the blocky G-phase (Ni 16 Nb 6 Si 7) gradually transforms to granular NbC, and distribute {{at the center of}} chromium carbide.

50|$|Residual {{oil from}} the vacuum {{distillation}} unit (sometimes including high-boiling oils from other sources within the refinery) is pumped {{into the bottom of}} the distillation column called the main fractionator. From there, it is pumped, along with some injected steam, into the fuel-fired furnace and heated to its thermal cracking temperature of about 480 °C. Thermal cracking begins in the pipe between the furnace and the coke drums, and finishes in the coke drum that is on-stream.

40|$|A ceramic {{cylinder}} {{has been}} developed as an accessory to a standard DuPont 951 Thermogravimetric Analyzer to study weight changes of solid samples in corrosive atmospheres. This device has two purposes to be fulfilled at higher temperatures (G 9 OOOC) and higher gas flow rates (G 14 cm s-l) : (1) preventing mixing of reactant and purge gases {{at the location of}} the sample; and (2) keeping the corrosive reactant gas from the balance sections. EXPERIMENTAL For corrosive atmospheres such as nitrogen mixtures with sulphur dioxide etc., the instruction manual of the DuPont 951 Thermogravimetric Analyzer [l] advises the installation of a gas inlet tube on the <b>furnace</b> <b>tube</b> between the furnace and the balance housing. A stopcock is sealed to the, Pyrex bell jar to purge the back end of the balance assembly. The normal gas inlet, located on the balance housing, is also flushed with the inert gas. The reactive gas is admitted through the side arm of the <b>furnace</b> <b>tube</b> so that it will flow to the sample along with the purge gas. The main disadvantage of this system is that the purge gas mixes with the reactant gas around the sample making it difficult to establish a constant and reproducible concentration of the latter. To avoid this, we worked with a different modification. This does not require a complicated double <b>furnace</b> <b>tube,</b> as described by Ruth et al. [2] and Ulerich et al. [3].
