Tan, who had made his directorial debut in 1940, based Srigala <b>Item</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stories surrounding Johnston McCulley's fictional bandit Zorro; as with the American bandit, the Black Wolf used a whip and wore all black. The black-and-white film was shot by The Teng Chun's brother Teng Gan, with Hajopan Bajo Angin as artistic designer.|$|E

He kept serving as Governor and left Wisconsin's U.S. Senate seat unfilled until January 1, 1906, when he resigned to join the U.S. Senate. He publicly proclaimed this unusual action was done to ensure that his 1904 platform was enacted in Wisconsin.|$|E
25|$|Behind the scenes, China's {{media was}} ordered to tone down {{coverage}} of the unfolding scandal to prevent unrest. News editors were ordered {{to adhere to the}} official copy of Xinhua. Traditionally, media knows to avoid negative news coverage, and CCTV shifted reporting emphasis on the forthcoming launch of Shenzhou VII. The announcement of the AQSIQ test results was relegated to the final <b>item</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> CCTV evening news.|$|E
25|$|Copepods {{are usually}} the {{dominant}} zooplankton. Some scientists say they form the largest animal biomass on the planet. The other contender is the Antarctic krill. But copepods are smaller than krill, with faster growth rates, and they are more evenly distributed throughout the oceans. This means copepods almost certainly contribute more secondary production to the world's oceans than krill, and perhaps more than all other groups of marine organisms together. They are a major <b>item</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forage fish menu.|$|E

25|$|Placement of the Chemistry Building {{generated}} {{much controversy}} from student groups because it displaced {{a large portion}} of greenery in the center of West Campus. A temporary outdoor plaza was constructed outside of Sangren Hall in 2007 to replace the greenery. However, this also generated controversy and protests among students and faculty because of its aesthetic characteristics and costs. One such protest by a student group involved requesting the financial records of the construction and using chalk to depict the costs of each <b>item</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> plaza.|$|E
25|$|Snow Patrol {{undertook}} a short UK & Ireland Tour {{to coincide with}} the release of Eyes Open on 1 May. The tour began at Dublin Castle (at the Heineken Green Energy Festival) and was to finish with two nights at The Forum, London. But due to tickets selling out quickly and the success of SG#3, an additional date was added at the Ulster Hall. Later, support acts were confirmed. A news <b>item</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> official website said that the band intended to include different acts on different dates.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundation}} of state's school system—the first state-funded {{system in the}} nation—also began to be laid during Hendricks's administration. During his tenure as governor each township was granted land on which a public school could be established. The value of these improvements totaled over $1.25 million, making it the highest dollar <b>item</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> budget to that date. Construction of the State Seminary, later to become Indiana University, also began during his term. Hendricks also contributed personally to Hanover College. As the state's finances would not allow the large-scale improvements Hendricks envisioned, he focused efforts on creating critical routes and approved legislation that required state residents to spend allotted amounts of time helping to build the state roads. Existing roads and rivers were improved by clearing obstacles.|$|E

25|$|Cues act {{as guides}} {{to what the}} person is {{supposed}} to remember. A cue can be virtually anything that may act as a reminder, e.g. a smell, song, color, place etc. In contrast to free recall, the subject is prompted to remember a certain <b>item</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> list or remember the list in a certain order. Cued recall also plays into free recall because when cues are provided to a subject, they will remember items on the list {{that they did not}} originally recall without a cue. Tulving explained this phenomenon in his research. When he gave participants associative cues to items that they did not originally recall and that were thought to be lost to memory, the participants were able to recall the item.|$|E
25|$|Copepods, {{the primary}} zooplankton, {{are a major}} <b>item</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forage fish menu. They are a group of small {{crustaceans}} found in ocean and freshwater habitats. Copepods are typically one millimetre (0.04in) to two millimetres (0.08in) long, with a teardrop shaped body. Some scientists say they form the largest animal biomass on the planet. Copepods are very alert and evasive. They have large antennae (see photo below left). When they spread their antennae they can sense the pressure wave from an approaching fish and jump with great speed over a few centimeters. If copepod concentrations reach high levels, schooling herrings adopt a method called ram feeding. In the photo below, herring ram feed on a school of copepods. They swim with their mouth wide open and their opercula fully expanded.|$|E
25|$|On {{the shield}} version, the AATTV unit {{name on the}} boomerang was in block higher case text and the motto on the scroll was in heraldic higher case. On unit correspondence, all text was {{displayed}} in block higher case. As the boomerang is a ready-to-use weapon, the crossbow was presented loaded so that both symbolised the AATTV and the Army of the Republic of Vietnam as being ready for action. Each <b>item</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> badge, each colour, each item of text and {{the shape of the}} shield, in combination, are symbolic of Australia's military traditions, the individual Australian soldier's reputation in combat and, in particular, the AATTV's record of valour. Ironically the crossbow was not a symbol of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, but a weapon used by the Montagnard and banned by President Ngo Dinh Diem in 1955.|$|E

25|$|Governor William Guy {{called in}} 500 {{troops from the}} North Dakota National Guard to quell the riot. Over 1,000 partiers were still in Zap when the guard {{arrived on the scene}} at 6:30 am, {{although}} just 200 of them were still awake. The guardsmen with fixed bayonets roused the hungover students. There was little resistance to the dispersal. This all took place in front of national media outlets that had gathered at Zap to document the occasion. In fact, the Zip to Zap was the lead <b>item</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> CBS Evening News that day. It was also covered by Pravda, the news outlet of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the Stars and Stripes of the United State Armed Forces. Damage from the riot was estimated to be greater than $25,000. These bills were ultimately paid by the student governments of North Dakota State University and the University of North Dakota.|$|E
25|$|On 20 January 1966, a Force 8 gale blew up and Mi Amigos anchors {{broke and}} the ship started to drift. This went unnoticed by the crew, who were {{watching}} a programme about the singer-songwriter Donovan, broadcasting having ended. The final song played that night had been Eve of Destruction by Barry McGuire. Dave Lee Travis went aloft to adjust the TV aerial and noticed that the ship was close to shore. He was also unable to see the Radio London ship Galaxy. Walton-on-the-Naze Coastguards were unable to raise the crew, and the tender Offshore One was sent to her aid. One of the methods of alerting the crew tried was an <b>item</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> television news. This was missed by the crew as they had turned the television off as they had lost the signal due to the ship moving from its normal position. Mi Amigo was driven ashore at Frinton-on-Sea, Essex and the crew were rescued by Breeches buoy.|$|E
25|$|Result: Platinum {{got out to}} {{an early}} start, getting some {{relatively}} good discounts on their first few items, but things were marred by infighting among the sub-team of David, Amy and Lucy. The team also struggled to find {{some of the more}} expensive items on the list, and were late back to the Coliseum. None of the Odyssey members started buying anything until three hours in, with the sub-team of Patrick, Maria and Navdeep spending a further three hours doing research. Their research did pay off however, as they got some significant discounts on the items that they did buy. Ultimately the teams both bought only five of the ten items each. However, Platinum were cost dearly by being late and not buying a second-hand car, the most expensive <b>item</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> list and correspondingly the one with the biggest fine. Platinum's total spend was £2,204, and Odyssey's total spend was £2,033.|$|E
