40|$|Your {{committee}} set {{the scene}} for this paper by asking me to address the following questions: 1. What does a <b>high</b> <b>producing</b> <b>cow</b> really need? 2. Realistic costs of minerals. 3. Are chelated products really necessary? 4. Testing regime. How often and how much should we spend? 5. Do young stock require anything different? I’m going to start by answering questions 1 + 5 together, and simply. Of course, {{the needs of the}} high yielding cow, in terms of g or mg of mineral/day, are much greater than those of the calf, but the dietary concentrations needed in their diet are essentially the very similar. This is because the much greater requirement for energy and protein of the high yielding dairy cow means that it has a much larger DM intake which carries in more mineral. Remember, mineral intake is dry matter (DM) intake x mineral concentration in DM, so that the higher mineral demands of the <b>high</b> <b>producing</b> <b>cow</b> are provided by the greater DM intake, provided she is well fed. Calculations from nutritional principles of the minimum dietary requirements for a range of minerals are given in Table 1 for a 200 kg calf growing at 1 kg/d and for a 500 kg dairy cow producing either 10 or 30 litres milk/d together with the range of concentrations observed in herbages in New Zealand. The data are taken directly from Grace, Knowles & Sykes (2010) and show remarkably consistent mineral requirement when expressed as dietary concentration. So neither the rapidly growing calf nor the very high yielding cow have particular dietary requirements when fully fed...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of seasonal changes in thermal environment and pregnancy on the physiological responses of crossbred dairy cows (Butana x Friesian). Also, it was intended to examine the nycthermal changes in physiological parameters in highand low <b>producing</b> <b>cows</b> under local tropical conditions. In experiment 1, crossbred multiparous dairy cows were divided into four groups according to reproductive state (empty, early, mid and late pregnancy). The cows were exposed to a normal grazing programme under natural summer and winter conditions. The rectal temperature (Tr) and respiratory rate (RR) were significantlyhigher during summer than during at different stages of pregnancy; there was an increase in Tr and RR with the advance of pregnancy. The packedcell volume (PCV) and haemoglobin concentration (Hb) were significantly higher in summer; however, both parameters decreased in late pregnancy. The cows had higher total leukocyte count (TLC) in winter only during early pregnancy. The TLC was significantly higher in winter comparedto the respective summer value in early pregnancy. For all experimentalgroups serum levels of glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides and urea were significantly higher during summer than winter. Plasma glucose levels decreased with the advance of pregnancy. There was a tendency for decrease in triglyceride level with the advance of pregnancy. The urea level tended to behigher during early pregnancy in both seasons. The activity of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was higher, while alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was lower in empty group and late pregnancy during summer than during winter. The ALT activity increased significantly with the advance of pregnancy and the AST level was iv significantly higher during late pregnancy in both seasons. Serum calcium (Ca) level was higher in the empty group and mid pregnancy and serum phosphorus (P) level was lower in all experimental groups during summer. There was a decrease in Ca level and an increase in P level with advance of pregnancy. Serum magnesium (Mg) level was significantly higher during winter in empty and early pregnancy. Serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was elevated in summer than in winter. Serum triiodothyronine (T 3) was higher in summer, and there was slight decrease with the advance of pregnancy in both seasons. Serum thyroxine (T 4) was lower in summer in all groups. Serum cortisol increased in response to summer heat load, and was higher during late pregnancy in both seasons. In experiment 2, twelve crossbred (Butana x Friesian) empty multiparous dairy cows were selected and divided into two groups (<b>high</b> and low <b>producing</b> dairy <b>cows).</b> The nycthermal changes in physiological parameters were monitored for 48 hours. Rectal temperature (Tr) increased in the afternoon (12 : 00 p. m.) in both groups. The <b>high</b> <b>producing</b> <b>cows</b> maintained <b>higher</b> Trvalues during the course ofthe study. Respiratory rate (RR) was increased the afternoon in both groups of cows; the <b>high</b> <b>producing</b> <b>cows</b> maintained <b>higher</b> RR values than low <b>producing</b> <b>cows.</b> Heamatocrit and Hb concentration were slightly <b>higher</b> in <b>high</b> <b>producing</b> <b>cows</b> than in low <b>producing</b> <b>cows.</b> Serum levels of glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides showed no significant diurnal variation in both groups of cows. Serum urea concentration showed relative instability in both experimental groups. Serum levels of glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides and urea were lower in <b>high</b> <b>producing</b> <b>cows</b> than inthe low <b>producing</b> <b>cows.</b> AST and ALT showed irregular diurnal variation in the both <b>high</b> and low <b>producing</b> <b>cows.</b> The <b>high</b> v <b>producing</b> <b>cows</b> maintained slightly <b>higher</b> aminotransferase enzymes activity. Serum cortisol level was higher at 12 : 00 p. m and 6 : 00 p. m. compared to values monitored in the morning (6 : 00 a. m.) and night (12 : 00 p. m). The cortisol level was <b>higher</b> in <b>high</b> <b>producing</b> <b>cows</b> than in low <b>producing</b> <b>cows.</b> Serum insulin level did not reveal significant diurnal variation in both groups of cows. Highproducing cows maintained higher serum insulin level than in the low <b>producing</b> <b>cows.</b> The results indicated that under local tropical conditions when the temperature humidity index (THI) exceeds 75 during summer, dairy cows were exposed to heat stress conditions which affect thermoregulatory response, serum metabolite level and endocrine responses that could impact negatively productivity and reporoductivity performance. The stage of pregnancy had significant influence onthermoregulation, erythrocytic parameters, serum levels of Ca, P and cortisol. The nycthermal effect did not influence most of the parameters, because there was no critical change in climatic conditions during the course of the study. High milk yield influenced thermoregulation, blood constituents and endocrine responses...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{is to examine the}} correlation of milk fat percent with the amount of trans- 10 C 18 : 1 in milk, as well as to identify the relationship between trans- 10 C 18 : 1 in milk to the dietary nutrient parameters. A trend of decreased milk fat percent with a corresponding increase of trans- 10 C 18 : 1 in the milk was exhibited. However, no significant correlation was determined between milk fat percent and milk trans- 10 C 18 : 1. The dietary nutrient fractions, ether extract, starch digestibility, and acid detergent fiber were not found to have a significant relationship to the amount of trans- 10 C 18 : 1 measured in milk. The total dietary fatty acids were found to have a positive relationship with trans- 10 C 18 : 1 level in milk (R 2 =. 33, P=. 02). Fractions of the total dietary fatty acids, unsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids each also exhibited a positive relationship to milk levels of trans- 10 C 18 : 1 (R 2 =. 24, P=. 004 and R 2 =. 3711, P=. 0001, respectively). Thus, these data support the theory of increasing dietary fatty acids, both unsaturated and saturated, resulting in an increase in trans- 10 C 18 : 1 level in milk.

Embryo transfers using in vitro produced embryos (IVP) might certainly have an advantage over conventional breeding methods since ovulation, fertilization and early embryonic stages would be bypassed thereby enhancing the likelihood of embryo implantation and hence improved conception rates. However, there are several challenges to producing good quality embryos in vitro due to difficulties in emulating the natural oviduct microenvironments that the preimplantation embryo is experiencing several physiological changes en route to the uterus. The objectives of this work were to review current literature in regard to mammalian preimplantation embryo production in vitro with emphasis in bovine species and to study the effect of metabolic regulators (MR) on embryo development as well as using new methods to recover better quality sperm especially when using sex-sorted semen. Chapter Two is an extensive review of the IVP process in mammalian species with emphasis on the bovine embryo. Metabolic processes during oocyte in vitro maturation, sperm interactions during fertilization and in vitro cultures of different preimplantation embryo stages are reviewed. Special attention was devoted to the metabolic switch from low to high glucose uptake and metabolism occurring at the morula stage. Chapter Three is a systematic study of the effects of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomers on embryos produced in vitro. Inclusion of 100 [mu]M CLA- cis 9, trans 11 during embryo culture 36 hrs before cryopreservation resulted in embryos with higher survival and better developmental rates post-thaw when compared to other groups. Chapter Four presents a study about the effect of phenazine ethosulfate (PES) and 2, 4 -dinitrophenol (DNP) on embryo development at the morula stage to enhance glucose uptake and metabolism to improve embryo developmental rates. Combination of 0. 3 [mu]M PES and 10 [mu]M DNP resulted not only in higher embryo development and better quality but also embryos more resistant to cryopreservation procedures. Chapter Five describes a study of the effect of four colloidal-based sperm washes (Percoll, Old Bovipure, New Bovipure and Androcoll-B) on embryo development and quality. The International Embryo Transfer Society regulations strictly indicate that bovine embryos produced in vitro should be originated from sperm that has been recovered by silane-coated silica particles colloids when fractionation methods are used due to the debatable toxic effects of Percoll. Results from these experiments showed that embryos derived from sperm recovered by New Bovipure and Androcoll-B achieved higher blastocyst rates than Percoll and Old Bovipure groups. In addition, as a followup the effects of MR were evaluated on embryos originated from X-sorted semen. Interestingly, PES and DNP supplementation resulted in delayed development and poorer morphology in this embryos compared with untreated counterparts. Glucose uptake threshold may be lower in female embryos and/or they may have a different substrate preference as compared to male embryos. Our contribution to science may provide information for a better understanding of IVP and help shape the direction of future research. More importantly, it may provide the basis for production of better quality embryos originated from genderselected semen with more chance of survival to term, thereby improving conception rates in dairy cattle...|$|E
40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsJeffery R. WilliamsEconomically {{optimized}} ration formulations {{were used}} to test whether California dairy producers who implemented price risk management strategies on both the input and output sides achieved significantly higher net returns as measured by milk income minus feed costs compared to producers who bought feed and sold milk on the spot market. Two ration formulation models were developed, a least cost and a profit-maximization. The least cost method formulates a ration that meets the nutritional requirements of a lactating cow at the lowest possible cost for a given level of milk production. The profit maximization model incorporates into its algorithm a production function between net energy intake and milk production that increases at a decreasing rate. For today's high producing cows, after being supplied with enough energy to meet maintenance requirements, all additional energy is partitioned for milk production. Up to a certain point, depending {{on the price of}} milk and the price of feed, the cost of providing additional feed units is more than offset by the revenues derived by the extra milk produced from the larger quantities of feed consumed. The profit-maximization model used formulates a ration using both feed and milk prices where the cost of the last unit of feed provided is equal to the revenues of the last unit of milk produced. 	To compare returns, a ration program was designed that could either use spot or forward values for feed costs and milk price to economically optimize the ration on a weekly basis in the cow’s milk production cycle. To better gauge the impact of price volatility on both the input and output sides and to account for the extended nature of the forward contracts, the 305 -day lactation cycle of a <b>high</b> <b>producing</b> <b>cow</b> over six successive cycles was used. The federal order Class III milk price was used for milk values and it was assumed that unless the producer engaged in some sort of forward contract, the milk price received was the monthly Class III value. To account for forward sales, the Class III futures contract traded at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange was used. For the feed prices, the ration model had a library of 16 different ingredients, 11 of which had forward and spot values. Similar to the output side, it was assumed that unless the producer engaged in some sort of forward contract the feed price used was the spot value averaged for each month. 	Most California dairy operators use some version of the least-cost method when formulating their rations. A large number also forward contract a significant portion of their feed as the concept of forward contracting feed is much more common in the western U. S. as compared to other regions in the country. Conversely, there has been little interest in locking in future milk prices as the tools for forward contracting are relatively new and many producers are not familiar with the mechanics. This helps explain the limited use of the profit-maximization model since milk prices {{are an integral part of}} this process. Results of this study show that producers who formulate using the profit-maximization model attain higher milk production and derive higher milk revenues, albeit with higher feed costs. Nonetheless, across every situation, that is whether one forward contracts feed, milk, or some combination thereof the profit-maximization model returned anywhere from $ 0. 14 to $ 0. 19 of milk revenues in excess of feed costs per hundredweight of milk as opposed to the least-cost method. For a producer milking 1, 000 cows this represents another $ 50, 000 to $ 70, 000 of income per year. The results also show that whether least-cost or the profit-maximization method is employed, feed costs were lower when producers forward contract at least a portion of their needs. Milk prices, on the other hand, were lower relying on the spot market as opposed to either of the two forward milk contracting models that were developed. Finally, the variability of returns as measured by the coefficient of variability show less volatility in revenues when producers forward contract milk and less variability with input costs when producers forward contract feed...|$|E

To enhance the possible differences in host resistance between <b>high</b> and low <b>producing</b> <b>cows,</b> the animals in both groups were metabolically stressed by overfeeding during the dry period or were fed according to requirements, resulting in four groups of nine cows. The metabolic status was monitored from two weeks pre-partum until 2. 5 - 4. 5 weeks post-partum. Host resistance was assessed by measuring the severity of experimentally induced Escherichia coli mastitis. Pre-partum blood glucose levels tended to be higher in overfed cows than in cows fed according to requirements. The post-partum energy balance was significantly more negative in <b>high</b> <b>producing</b> <b>cows</b> than in low producers, and {{tended to be more}} negative in overfed cows compared to cows fed according to the requirements.

Measures of energy intake, energy balance and efficiency of energy utilisation were calculated using metabolisable energy (ME) prediction equations derived from individual animal measurements of milk production, condition score and liveweight. There was considerable variation in the energy balance measures, with 2. 5 % of cows having less than 15 days in negative energy balance out of 100 days and 1 % of cows being in negative energy balance for all 100 days. <b>Higher</b> <b>producing</b> <b>cows</b> had <b>higher</b> levels of GH and lower levels of IGF- 1 and a greater amount of body tissue depletion compared to lower <b>producing</b> <b>cows.</b> <b>Cows</b> with <b>higher</b> ratios of milk ME over maintenance ME had lower circulating levels of IGF- 1 and higher GH as well as greater body tissue depletion in the first 100 days of lactation. The relationship between energy balance, efficiency and IGF- 1 with fertility and the impact of these relationships on economic efficiency require further investigation...|$|R

ISSN 1401 - 6249, ISBN 91 - 576 - 6426 - 9 The general {{aim of the}} present work {{was to investigate the}} opportunities for a planned extended {{calving interval}} (CI) in dairy cattle, and how it would effect production and animal welfare. Furthermore, the effects of combining an extended calving interval with an increased milking frequency (MF) was evaluated. The milk production per cow has increased dramatically during recent decades. In thirty years average milk production per cow has increased by more than 3000 kg energy corrected milk (ECM), and the development towards still higher milk yields {{does not appear to be}} stopping. High milk yields in combination with a minimised CI results in high yields when drying off, problems at the onset of the lactation and bad utilisation of the milk production capacity of the cow. The current management methods for <b>high</b> <b>producing</b> <b>cows</b> also results in a short length of life and must b...|$|R
40|$|The {{dairy cow}} is {{particularly}} well adapted for consuming and utilizing {{large quantities of}} roughages, though she responds well to grain feeding. The relative quantities of roughage and grain that should be fed are usually determined by the physiologic effects and economic efficiencies of such rations when fed to dairy cattle. One would hardly expect <b>high.</b> <b>producing</b> <b>cows</b> to maintain a high yield when consuming roughage alone, because such a ration is so bulky that it prevents the intake of sufficient nutrients for maximum production. And yet, very good results have been obtained in certain areas by such a system of feeding. Then, too, the nutrients of roughage crops are usually produced at considerably less cost than those of grain crops (17) (3). Furthermore, rough. ages are more plentiful on most farms than grain crops, especially in recent years when {{there has been a}} marked increase in the production of hay and pasture crops at some sacrifice of grain production. Under these conditions the advisability of supplementing roughage rations with grain becomes a question of interest to dairy farmers...|$|R
40|$|Introduction <b>High</b> <b>producing</b> dairy <b>cows</b> {{are often}} fed large {{quantities}} of high quality proteins, and because ruminal protein degradation is not directly coupled to microbial protein synthesis, ruminal NH 3 -N production is always excessive and ultimately lost by urinary N excretion. Increasing the supply of ruminally fermentable carbohydrates can reduce ruminal ammonia-N concentration and increase milk protein yield (Sannes et al., 2002). The addition of sugar has increased ruminal and whole animal N efficiency in sheep and steers, reportedly {{to a greater extent}} than starc...|$|R
40|$|The {{goals of}} <b>high</b> <b>producing</b> dairy <b>cow</b> {{nutrition}} are to provide {{good health and}} condition of animals, normal 300 -day long lactation, more lactation cycle during exploitation, maximal amount of milk yield with optimal chemical contents, as well as bringing healthy and vital veal once a year. Nutrients metabolism disturbances in dairy cows mostly expressed in periparturient period due to higher demands needed for fetus growth and development, {{as well as for}} requirements for lactation. Energy metabolism disorder in dairy cows mostly appeared as kethosis complicated with liver fatty acid accumulation that firstly caused fatty infiltration and later fatty degeneration of hepatocytes. Besides energy, in this period changes of mineral status are very common as consequences of higher mineral deposition in skeleton of fetus, and secretion via milk by beginning of the lactation. Mineral metabolism disorder in dairy cows, firstly calcium, mostly appeared as paresis and paralysis. Dairy cows peripartal metabolic disturbances are very dependent and caused among themselves commonly leading to mutual appearance. That’s why the meal for <b>high</b> <b>producing</b> dairy <b>cow</b> in periparturient period have to be optimal balanced not only according to amount of some nutrients, but their relationship, as well as their influences on metabolic pathways and homeostasis...|$|R
40|$|This study {{determined}} colostrum {{production of}} lactating primiparous and multiparous Holstein dairy cows, {{as well as}} the predictability of full lactation milk yield based upon this colostrum production. Holstein cows that calved between December 18, 2006 and December 24, 2007 (n = 134) had their first two post-partum milkings weighed and assayed for density. Cows then entered normal production groups and were assessed for milk yield and milk components every 4 or 5 weeks for the duration of their lactation. Primiparous <b>cows</b> <b>produced</b> less colostrum (10. 6 versus 13. 6 kg; P = 0. 02) and density adjusted (DA) colostrum (5. 2 versus 8. 5 kg; P < 0. 01), but there were no differences in estimated 305 day mature equivalent (305 ME) milk production (mean = 13, 654 kg) or lactation lengths (mean = 301 days) between parities. Colostrum and DA colostrum were poor estimators of subsequent 305 ME milk production within primiparous cows (r 2 = 0. 20 and 0. 01 respectively) and multiparous cows (r 2 = 0. 18 and 0. 12 respectively). Colostrum production of these <b>high</b> <b>producing</b> <b>cows</b> was somewhat lower than expected, highly variable among cows within parity, higher for multiparous versus primiparous cows, and was not a good estimator of subsequent 305 ME milk production...|$|R
40|$|Test day (TD) {{records of}} milk, fat and protein yields and somatic cell scores (SCS) were studied in Holstein cows in Tunisia. There were 43114, 32923 and 24633 {{lactation}} records collected on first, {{second and third}} parity cows between 1992 and 2004 in 182 herds. Records were of cows born in Tunisia (22000 cows) and those imported from Europe (10830 cows) and North America (850 cows). Variation of total days in milk (DIM) per lactation was studied in function of the herd, calving year x calving season interaction and {{the origin of the}} cow. Test-day records were analyzed using a linear model that included calving year x calving season and herd x test-day date interactions, calving season, calving year and origin of the cow. The effective length of lactation was affected by all factors included in the model (p 0. 05). Cows born in Tunisia seemed to perform better than imported cows in the first lactation while imported cows showed clearly better performances in later lactations. North American <b>cows</b> <b>produced</b> the <b>highest</b> yields and had the lowest SCS among all cows {{in the second and third}} lactations.
