40|$|Technicians {{no longer}} exposed to {{hazardous}} cleaning materials. Proposed computer-controlled facility cleans bellow-type expansion joints and large flex hoses. Major portions of automated cleaning facility contained in clean room. One {{piece of equipment}} in clean room tower in which <b>hose</b> or expansion <b>joint</b> to be cleaned hoisted by hydraulic machinery and hung vertically. Once <b>hose</b> or expansion <b>joint</b> hung in required position, technician initiates programmed cleaning procedure from console on computer monitoring system. Procedure includes degreasing, cleaning with detergents, rinsing, pickling, and passivating operations. After cleaning completed, technician removes <b>hose</b> or expansion <b>joint</b> from tower and wraps open ends to prevent recontamination of interior...|$|R
25|$|Because of its extreme non-reactivity {{and high}} {{temperature}} rating, PTFE {{is often used}} as the liner in <b>hose</b> assemblies, expansion <b>joints,</b> and in industrial pipe lines, particularly in applications using acids, alkalis, or other chemicals. Its frictionless qualities allow improved flow of highly viscous liquids, and for uses in applications such as brake hoses.|$|R

The cruiser played 10 streams {{of water on the}} persistent fires, while 40 men, trapped astern in Bunker Hill scrambled to safety. The destroyers , , and [...] also added their fire <b>hoses</b> to the <b>joint</b> effort to save the stricken carrier.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the cost-effectiveness of conventional parabolic trough (PT) fields {{it is essential to}} reduce Capital Expenditure (Capex) as well as Operations and Maintenance (O&M) costs, in particular the need for flexible <b>hosing</b> or rotating <b>joints,</b> which are used because the tubular receiver also tracks in a solidary way with the trough. One possible alternative is to design a different type of optic with the center of mass on the center of the tubular receiver, generating the possibility of it being fixed, thereby dispensing with flexible <b>hosing</b> or rotating <b>joints,</b> without penalizing its overall efficiency or even concentration. In this work, two possible optical solutions, combining parabolic-type primaries with second-stage non-imaging optics concentrators for fixed receivers, are presented. These concentrators are designed using the Simultaneous Multiple Surface (SMS) design method and the infinitesimal etendue limit. A performance comparison with a conventional PT in terms of optical efficiency, CAP (Concentration-Acceptance Product) and other performance data are also presented, including an estimate of the total amount of yearly collected energy (kW h/m 2 of entrance aperture) for one particular location – Faro (Portugal) ...|$|R
50|$|Non-dyed {{silicone}} rubber tape with an iron-oxide additive (making the tape a red-orange colour) is used extensively in aviation and aerospace wiring applications as a splice or wrapping tape {{due to its}} non-flammable nature. The iron-oxide additive adds high thermal conductivity but {{does not change the}} high electrical insulation property of the {{silicone rubber}}. This type of self-amalgamating tape amalgamates or fuses to itself, so that when stretched and wrapped around cables, electrical <b>joints,</b> <b>hoses</b> and pipes it bonds into a strong seamless rubbery electrically insulating and waterproof layer, although not adhesive.|$|R
5000|$|Self-amalgamating tape is a non-tacky silicone-rubber tape which when {{stretched}} and wrapped around cables, electrical <b>joints,</b> <b>hoses</b> and pipes combines or unites {{itself into a}} strong, seamless, rubbery, waterproof, and electrically insulating layer. Unlike many other polymers and fibers, it is heat-, sunlight-, and weather-resistant. This type of tape is also described, particularly in the United States, as [...] "self-fusing", or [...] "self-vulcanizing". In the US Air Force (and elsewhere) it is called centerline tape due to a colored line running down the center used to assist with even wrapping. It is also called F4, Tommy Tape,http://www.tommytape.com/, rescue, and fix-it tape.|$|R
40|$|The National Solar Thermal Test Facility at Sandia National Laboratories has {{a unique}} test {{capability}} called the Molten Salt Test Loop (MSTL) system. MSTL is a test capability that allows customers and researchers to test components in flowing, molten nitrate salt. The components tested can range from materials samples, to individual components such as flex <b>hoses,</b> ball <b>joints,</b> and valves, up to full solar collecting systems such as central receiver panels, parabolic troughs, or linear Fresnel systems. MSTL provides realistic conditions similar to {{a portion of a}} concentrating solar power facility. The facility currently uses 60 / 40 nitrate %E 2 % 80 % 9 Csolar salt%E 2 % 80 % 9 D and can circulate the salt at pressure up to 40 bar (600 psi), temperature to 585 %C 2 %B 0 C, and flow rate of 44 - 50 kg/s(400 - 600 GPM) depending on temperature. The purpose of this document is to provide a basis for customers to evaluate the applicability to their testing needs, and to provide an outline of expectations for conducting testing on MSTL. The document can {{serve as the basis for}} testing agreements including Work for Others (WFO) and Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA). While this document provides the basis for these agreements and describes some of the requirements for testing using MSTL and on the site at Sandia, the document is not sufficient by itself as a test agreement. The document, however, does provide customers with a uniform set of information to begin the test planning process...|$|R
50|$|L&T - Construction Equipment Limited: {{having its}} {{registered}} office at Mumbai, India {{and focusing on}} construction equipment and mining equipment, L&T-Komatsu Limited was a joint-venture of Larsen and Toubro, and Komatsu Asia Pacific Pte Limited, Singapore, a wholly owned subsidiary of Komatsu Limited, Japan. Komatsu is the world’s second largest manufacturer of hydraulic excavators and has manufacturing and marketing facilities. The plant was started in 1975 by L&T to manufacture hydraulic excavators {{for the first time}} in India. In 1998, it became a joint-venture. The Bengaluru works comprises machinery and hydraulics works, with a manufacturing facility for design, manufacture and servicing of earth moving equipment. The hydraulics works has a precision machine shop, manufacturing high pressure hydraulic components and systems, and designing, developing, manufacturing and servicing hydraulic pumps, motors, cylinders, turning <b>joints,</b> <b>hose</b> assemblies, valve blocks, hydraulic systems and power drives as well as allied gear boxes. In April 2013, L&T bought the 50% stake held by Komatsu Asia & Pacific. The company's name was changed to L&T Construction Equipment Limited.|$|R
40|$|The part-load {{behavior}} of a typical 30 -MWe SEGS (solar electric generating systems) plant was studied using a detailed thermodynamic model. As part of this analysis, a new solar field model was derived, based on measurement results of an LS- 2 Collector and accounting for various conditions of receiver tubes, lost mirrors and measured reflectivity. A comparison {{was made of the}} model results to real plant conditions for a winter and summer day in order to test the accuracy of the model. The effects of bare tubes, different wind speeds, mirror reflectivity and other factors were studied showing, e. g., that heat losses due to wind are predicted to be very low. The comparison also shows that the model still lacks the capability to fully account for actual solar field conditions. The model was also compared to the SOLERGY model, showing differences between the assumptions used in both models. Finally different operating conditions of the plant were studied for a summer, fall, and winter day to provide {{a better understanding of how}} changing solar field outlet temperatures affect gross and net output of the plant. This clearly indicates that the lowest possible superheating temperature maximizes the gross electric output. On a net basis this conclusion is modified due to the high parasitics of the HTF (heat transfer fluid) pumps. It was found that the optimum operating strategy depends on the insolation conditions, e. g., different superheating temperatures should be chosen in summer, fall and winter. If the pressure drop in the solar field is reduced due to replacement of flex <b>hoses</b> with ball <b>joints,</b> increasing the HTF flow is more reasonable, so that at low isolation conditions the lowest possible superheating temperature also leads to the maximum net output...|$|R
