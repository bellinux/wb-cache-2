5|$|The 19th Air Brigade's {{primary mission}} was to defend the {{industrial}} facilities in northern Kyūshū, and particularly the iron works at Yawata. The brigade's plans {{for the defense of}} the Western District called for its interceptor aircraft to be concentrated over Yawata and not move far from the area. While this inflexible deployment was considered unsatisfactory by the 19th Air Brigade, it was deemed necessary as few aircraft were available, the only searchlight units needed to facilitate night operations were stationed near Yawata and northern Kyūshū was regarded by the Army as being the most important region in the Western District. Prior to the raid on Yawata the 19th Air Brigade undertook <b>joint</b> <b>planning</b> with anti-aircraft units and implemented a training program which included practice in responding to alerts and night flying.|$|E
5|$|The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff {{position}} that Bostock occupied at {{the outbreak of}} World War II was a new one that initially augmented, and later supplanted, an existing Assistant Chief of the Air Staff role. Unlike the Assistant Chief, the Deputy {{had the authority to}} act in place of the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) if required. This increased status saw Bostock given a place on Australia's <b>Joint</b> <b>Planning</b> Committee. He was the RAAF's delegate to a defence conference in Singapore in October 1940, where the Australian contingent found the local forces ill-prepared for an attack by the Japanese, and recommended significant increases in air capability, both in Australia and the Pacific Islands, to meet the threat. Bostock rose rapidly in rank during this period, becoming acting air commodore on 1June 1940 and substantive air vice marshal on 1October 1941. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1942 New Year Honours.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{studies the}} problem of multi-agent {{planning}} in the environment where agents may need to cooperate {{in order to achieve}} their individual goals but they do so only if the cooperation is beneficial to each of them. We assume that each agent has a reward function and a cost function that determines the agent’s utility over all possible plans. The agents negotiate to form a <b>joint</b> <b>plan</b> through a procedure of alternating offers of <b>joint</b> <b>plans</b> and side-payments. We propose an algorithm that generates an agreement for any given planning problem and show that this agreement maximizes the gross utility and minimizes the distance to the ideal utility point.

40|$|Cooperation 1 is at {{the core}} of human social life. In this context, two major {{challenges}} face research on humanrobot interaction: the first is to understand the underlying structure of cooperation, and the second is to build, based on this understanding, artificial agents that can successfully and safely interact with humans. Here we take a psychologically grounded and human-centered approach that addresses these two challenges. We test the hypothesis that optimal cooperation between a naïve human and a robot requires that the robot can acquire and execute a <b>joint</b> <b>plan,</b> and that it communicates this <b>joint</b> <b>plan</b> through ecologically valid modalities including spoken language, gesture and gaze. We developed a cognitive system that comprises the human-like control of social actions, the ability to acquire and express shared plans and a spoken language stage. In order to test the psychological validity of our approach we tested 12 naïve subjects in a cooperative task with the robot. We experimentally manipulated the presence of a <b>joint</b> <b>plan</b> (vs. a solo plan), the use of task-oriented gaze and gestures, and the use of language accompanying the unfolding plan. The quality of cooperation was analyzed in terms of proper turn taking, collisions and cognitive errors. Results showed that while successful turn taking could take place in the absence of the explicit use of a <b>joint</b> <b>plan,</b> its presence yielded significantly greater success. One advantage of the solo plan was that the robot would always be ready to generate actions, and could thus adapt if the human intervened at the wrong time, whereas in the <b>joint</b> <b>plan</b> the robot expected the human to take his/her turn. Interestingly, when the robot represented the action as involving a <b>joint</b> <b>plan,</b> gaze provided a highly potent nonverbal cue that facilitated successful collaboration and reduced errors in the absence of verbal communication. These results support the cooperative stance in human social cogn- tion, and suggest that cooperative robots should employ <b>joint</b> <b>plans,</b> fully communicate them in order to sustain effective collaboration while being ready to adapt if the human makes a midstream mistake...|$|R

During this year, the carrier also visited Japan to participate in Expo '70, and was hit by Manly ferry South Steyne while alongside at Garden Island, causing minor damage to both vessels. Melbourne was out of service for most of 1971 while she underwent refits, which concluded in early August. In mid-1971, the Australian military's <b>Joint</b> <b>Planning</b> Committee considered using Melbourne as a transport to help complete {{the withdrawal of the}} Australian Task Force from Vietnam before the end of 1971. While the Army supported this proposal, the Navy successfully argued against its implementation, claiming that transporting troops and cargo would be misusing Australia's only active aircraft carrier, and would prevent Melbourne from participating in several major multi-national exercises. The refit concluded in late 1971, with the carrier participating in the first RIMPAC exercise, RIMPAC 71, {{before the end of the}} year.|$|E

5|$|However, South Vietnamese {{officers}} were often reluctant to absorb heavy casualties. On several occasions, Cao's forces {{were in an}} excellent position to trap and wipe out whole battalions of Viet Cong, but he would fail to close the trap on one pretext or another and allow the enemy to escape. This behavior initially mystified Vann, who was attempting to build Cao into an aggressive commander. Unknown to Vann, Diem would reprimand or demote any officer who lost too many men, no matter how successful the operation. Diem {{was more interested in}} using the military to protect his regime than to take on the Viet Cong. His solution was to fill the ARVN with Catholic political cronies and friends like Cao, Lê Quang Tung, and Tôn Thất Đính, who had little military ability, but were very likely to help stop a coup attempt. After a skirmish on a highway that resulted in a small number of South Vietnamese casualties along with several trucks destroyed, Cao was called to Saigon and reprimanded by Diem. Upon his return, Vann and his group of advisers were forced to end the <b>joint</b> <b>planning</b> sessions that had been so successful earlier, and action essentially wound down in their region. Cao used the excellent military intelligence network they had developed to find areas devoid of the Viet Cong, and planned operations only in those areas. In many other cases, operations were executed on paper only, in order to report an increasing tempo of operations that did not actually exist.|$|E
