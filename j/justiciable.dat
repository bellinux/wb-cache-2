5|$|The {{subject-matter}} of {{a dispute}} must be <b>justiciable</b> before the High Court {{will hear the}} case. A decision by an executive authority will generally be considered non-justiciable if the decision requires the intricate balancing of various competing policy considerations, and judges are ill-equipped to decide the case because of their limited training, experience and access to materials; if a judicial pronouncement could embarrass another branch of government or tie its hands {{in the conduct of}} affairs traditionally falling within its purview; or if the decision involves the exercise of a prerogative power that the democratically elected branches are entrusted to take care of. Nonetheless, a dispute may prima facie involve a non-justiciable area but the courts may decide that there is a <b>justiciable</b> matter within it, or the courts may be able to isolate a pure question of law from what is seemingly a non-justiciable issue. Because of the principle that all powers have legal limits, the Attorney-General's exercise of prosecutorial discretion and the power to pardon or grant clemency to convicted persons exercised by the President on the Cabinet's advice are both <b>justiciable</b> in exceptional cases, for instance, where the powers have been exercised unconstitutionally or in bad faith.|$|E
5|$|Threshold {{issues are}} legal {{requirements}} in Singapore administrative law {{that must be}} satisfied by applicants before their claims for judicial review of acts or decisions of public authorities {{can be dealt with}} by the High Court.

5|$|A {{legal issue}} must be <b>justiciable</b> before the High Court will grant an {{applicant}} leave {{to apply for}} judicial review. Justiciability recognizes the limited capabilities of the courts. It delineates certain issues which fall beyond the purview of judicial review because those matters are unsuited for adjudication, {{due to the nature}} of the litigation process and judicial expertise. The doctrine is based on an understanding of the separation of powers and the need to find the right constitutional balance between the courts and the executive. For example, matters of policy or subjective preference, and polycentric public policy issues, are better left in the hands of an elected body of persons.|$|E

40|$|The {{so-called}} Psychopath Laws {{were introduced}} in The Netherlands {{at the beginning of}} the 20 th century, with the purpose of ensuring the humane care and detention of disturbed criminals, and in so doing to prepare them for reintegration into society. In practice, however (especially in the early period following implementation of the legislation), all kinds of vagabonds, drunks and tramps were detained in order to bring them in line with the social order of the time - in other words, to keep them in custody so that they would no longer constitute a danger to society. These Psychopath Laws became, in fact, an instrument by which nuisance elements could be put behind bars. And once again we meet a similar 'nuisance criteria' in 2002, when the so-called SOV-Regulation came into force. This regulation has been incorporated into legislation governing the Legal Detention of Addicts (known in The Netherlands as the SOV Law), Statute Book 2001, no. 28. There are problems surrounding the question of whether the SOV regulation is actually used solely, or primarily, to put nuisance-element <b>justiciables</b> behind bars. SOV can only be effective if there are enough behaviour-expert arguments to support it. The field of behaviour-expertise is challenged to remain alert whereby <b>justiciables</b> are guaranteed the treatment they need...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This {{research}} {{provides a}} consistent analytical {{work in the}} study of Extrajudicial Conciliator’s obligation contained in Article 44 number 4 of Supreme Decree 014 - 2008 -JUS, the right of access to justice, the goals of the State to reach a Culture of Peace and an analysis of the conflict to understand it as a dynamic phenomenon.

5|$|Furthermore, {{the appeal}} did not engage foreign policy considerations. The treaty was a civil {{convention}} between two countries and {{an agreement to}} render mutual judicial assistance, and {{had nothing to do}} with foreign affairs other than that it was made between state parties. It also did not involve the policing of government conduct in international affairs, because it only implicated the procedures private litigants had to take to serve writs on defendants residing in Hong Kong. When interpreting the treaty, the Court only had to determine the domestic legal obligations of the respondents seeking to serve a writ out of jurisdiction. Thus, the issue of whether the treaty applied to Hong Kong was <b>justiciable,</b> and the Ministry's letter was not decisive on the matter.|$|E
5|$|In R. v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, {{ex parte}} Lain (1967), {{it was held}} that {{the powers of the}} Board were in {{principle}} reviewable, despite it having been established under prerogative powers. This case was cited with approval in the GCHQ case, which reflects the modern position on the reviewability of prerogative powers in the United Kingdom. In this case, their Lordships unanimously held that executive action was not immune from judicial review merely because it was carried out in pursuance of a power derived from the common law (or the prerogative) rather than a statutory source. It was the subject-matter that counted, not the source. In this case, the Government, through an order in council, banned employees of the Government Communications Headquarters from joining a trade union. The House of Lords held that this exercise of the prerogative was judicially reviewable, and the trade unions had a legitimate expectation of prior consultation before the ban was imposed. However, although the failure to consult the unions was unfair, this lapse from proper procedure was overridden by national security considerations and thus not <b>justiciable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rules {{three and}} five of the {{avoidance}} doctrine thus echo concerns addressed by the constitutional and prudential limitations of standing and ripeness. In some cases, the tenets of the avoidance doctrine addressed above— rules 1, 2, 3 and 5— may serve to buttress the conclusion that a case is not <b>justiciable,</b> or that a case is <b>justiciable</b> but the court will voluntarily decline to exercise its jurisdiction for prudential reasons. The avoidance doctrine {{as set out in}} these rules functions primarily as a supplement to established doctrines of standing and ripeness.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{began by}} {{considering}} {{the argument that the}} questions are not <b>justiciable</b> (i.e. the court did not have the authority to answer) based on it being a political question. The Court resolutely dismissed this claim for the reasons it gave in the Quebec Secession Reference.|$|E
25|$|While the Supreme Court's {{holding in}} Luther v.

25|$|When a <b>justiciable</b> issue arises, the {{decision-maker}} {{must give}} the parties a fair opportunity {{to present their}} cases and to correct or contradict any relevant statements prejudicial to them.

25|$|The Gibbs court {{made several}} {{important}} decisions in Australian constitutional law. It allowed the Federal Parliament to make very wide {{use of the}} external affairs power, by holding that this power {{could be used to}} implement treaties into domestic law with very few <b>justiciable</b> limits. In Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen (1982) four judges to three upheld the validity of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, although no single view had majority support. However, in the Tasmanian Dams case (1983), a majority of the court upheld federal environmental legislation under the power.|$|E

By contrast the Leibgarde der Hartschiere by itself was subordinated, concerning civilian and criminal <b>justiciable</b> affairs, to the General Command in Munich {{like the other}} military branches. In addition to the Hartschiere, the kings of Bavaria had a royal house regiment {{from the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars until the fall of the kingdom after World War I, the so-called Infantry Lifeguards Regiment.|$|E
25|$|Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs is {{the name}} of two cases of the Singapore courts, a High Court {{decision}} delivered in 1989 and the 1990 judgment in the appeal from that decision to the Court of Appeal. The cases were concerned with the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore and the Internal Security Act ("ISA") in 1989. The latter statute authorizes detention without trial on security grounds. These amendments had the effect of changing the law on judicial review of executive discretion under the ISA by re-establishing the subjective test enunciated in the 1971 High Court decision Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs which had been overruled in 1988 by Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs, and limiting the right of judicial review to ensuring compliance with procedures specified in the ISA. In other words, the amendments were intended to render the exercise of power by the President and the Minister for Home Affairs under the ISA to detain persons without trial not <b>justiciable</b> by the courts. Both the High Court and Court of Appeal found that these amendments were constitutional because Parliament had done nothing more than enact the rule of law relating to the law applicable to judicial review. Thus, the amendments validly operated to deprive the applicant Teo Soh Lung of the ability to apply to the courts for judicial review.|$|E
25|$|On 4 April 2011, the Court of Appeal {{dismissed}} {{an appeal}} filed by Yong against the judgment. It affirmed the High Court's {{view that the}} President did not possess any personal discretion when exercising the clemency power, and was required to act in accordance with Cabinet's advice on the matter. This conclusion was evident from the wording of Article 22P(1) of the Constitution, the legislative history of the clemency power in Singapore, relevant case law, {{and the nature of}} the President's power in the Constitution. The Court also noted that both Yong and the Attorney-General agreed that the power of clemency was vested exclusively in the executive and was not <b>justiciable</b> on the merits, because of the doctrine of separation of powers and established administrative law principles. Nonetheless, the use of the power could be judicially reviewed if it was exercised in bad faith for an extraneous purpose, or in a way that contravened constitutional protections and rights. In addition, the Court was of the opinion that the clemency process could not be regarded as having been tainted by a reasonable suspicion of bias due to the Law Minister's remarks. The Minister had merely been setting out the Government's policy of taking a tough approach towards serious drug trafficking offences by imposing a mandatory death penalty as a deterrent. In any case, the rule against bias should not be applied to ministers making public statements on government policy in the same way as it applies to judicial or quasi-judicial officers, otherwise no minister would be able to speak on any policy in public or in Parliament without the statement being regarded as a predetermination of any decision relating to the policy that might have to be made subsequently. Even if the Law Minister's statements indicated that he intended not to grant clemency to Yong, this predetermination could not be attributed to other Cabinet ministers. The alternative view was untenable, as it would mean that once any minister spoke about the Government's policy on the death penalty in a way that showed predetermination of the issue, the entire Cabinet would be disentitled from advising the President on how he should exercise the clemency power.|$|E
500|$|Before an {{administrative}} law claim {{can be heard}} on the merits by the High Court, the applicant must satisfy a number of legal requirements which may be called [...] "threshold issues". These include showing {{that he or she}} has standing (locus standi) to bring the case, and that the matter is amenable to judicial review and <b>justiciable</b> by the Court.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} held in Singapore that {{decisions}} by a public authority without any legal effect are not amenable to judicial review. In Tan Eng Chye v. Director of Prisons (2004), a case concerning an application for an order of certiorari to quash the certification by a prison medical officer that the applicant was fit to undergo a caning punishment, the High Court held that not every act of or conduct by a public servant is <b>justiciable</b> {{by way of a}} judicial review. The Court agreed with Lord Diplock in the GCHQ case that: ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{the law on}} {{this issue}} is {{presently}} unclear. In Lee Mau Seng, the High Court said that mala fides was not a <b>justiciable</b> issue {{in relation to the}} ISA. A similar stance was taken in Malaysia in Karam Singh. However, in Teo Soh Lung the Court of Appeal said that it did not need to decide whether Lee Mau Seng has precluded judicial review in mala fides situations until a case with a mala fides factual situation arises. Furthermore, there is an increasing number of Malaysian cases reflecting [...] "a gradual recognition that ... indicate a retreat from the purely subjective approach".|$|E
500|$|Even if the {{subject-matter}} {{of a case}} {{is generally}} non-justiciable, there are exceptions where the courts will still review the case. For instance, a dispute may prima facie involve a non-justiciable area but, on a closer look, the courts may decide {{that there is a}} <b>justiciable</b> matter within it. In such a situation, the courts will intervene and review the case. An example of this was given by Judicial Commissioner Menon in Lee Hsien Loong: [...] "here what appears to raise a question of international law in fact bears on the application of domestic law, that is something the court may well find justiciable." [...] In Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, the court similarly distinguished a pronouncement on the interpretation of a treaty generally, which is impermissible, from the consideration of [...] "the application of an international treaty by reference to the facts of an individual case" [...] which is allowed. Also, in R. v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, ex parte Everett (1988), the Court of Appeal of England and Wales took the view that a decision by the Secretary of State exercised under the royal prerogative to deny a passport to a British citizen residing abroad raised a <b>justiciable</b> issue because it was not a high policy matter involving foreign affairs but [...] "a matter of administrative decision, affecting the rights of individuals and their freedom of travel".|$|E
500|$|Springer then {{appealed to}} the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. [...] By the time that court heard the appeal, the {{reservation}} land had been allotted and excess land sold. [...] The D.C. Circuit ruled that the question was not <b>justiciable,</b> rather it was a political question {{which had to be}} decided by Congress. The Court held that an act of Congress must prevail over any specific article in a treaty with an Indian tribe. [...] The court further held that, in any event, the land did not belong to the tribe. It was controlled by the United States, with Indians as mere occupants. [...] The Circuit Court affirmed the decision of the lower court.|$|E
500|$|In Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs (1971), the High Court {{affirmed that}} {{with respect to}} the President's {{satisfaction}} that a person is acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore, mala fides or bad faith was [...] "not... a <b>justiciable</b> issue {{in the context of the}} Act and the power conferred by the Act on a body such as the President who has to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet to direct the issue of an order of detention if the President is satisfied with a view to preventing a person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore etc". Essentially, this means that the President's satisfaction is subjective, and not objective. The effect of this decision is that [...] "the Constitution left it to the executive, and not the judiciary, to decide what national security required". Subsequently, in Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the Court of Appeal took a different stand, holding that the objective test should apply to the review of the exercise of discretion under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA. (Section 10 empowers the Minister to direct that a detention order be suspended [...] "as the Minister sees fit", as well as to revoke such a direction.) The Court said that [...] "the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion is contrary to the rule of law" [...] because [...] "all power has legal limits", and therefore the exercise of discretionary power warrants examination by the court.|$|E
500|$|In Yong Vui Kong, the Court {{described}} the clemency power in Singapore as vested {{exclusively in the}} executive, and thus not <b>justiciable</b> on the merits. Despite this, {{it is not an}} [...] "extra-legal" [...] power that is beyond any legal constraints. Agreeing with Tan Guat Neo Phyllis, the Court held that the clemency power is subject to judicial review if it can be shown to have been exercised unconstitutionally, in bad faith or for extraneous purposes. In addition, the fact that Article22P(2) of the Constitution stipulates specific procedural safeguards in death penalty cases indicates that the clemency power must be reviewable to ensure that these safeguards have been complied with. Article22P(2) requires documents from the trial judge and the appellate court, and the Attorney-General's opinion on the case, to be sent to the Cabinet for consideration so that it can advise the President on the exercise of the clemency power. These procedural requirements imply that Cabinet has a constitutional duty to consider the documents in good faith before advising the President. If evidence is adduced to show that the Cabinet did not consider the offender's case impartially and in good faith (for example, it never met to discuss the case, or tossed a coin instead of properly considering the materials transmitted to it), Cabinet would have breached Article22P(2). In such a situation, the courts must be able to review the clemency decision. This conclusion is also mandated by the guarantee in Article 9(1) of the Constitution that a person may not be deprived of either life or personal liberty save in accordance with law.|$|E
500|$|R. (Bancoult) v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (2000), {{was a case}} {{concerning}} the forcible removal of the indigenous people of the Chagos Archipelago from Diego Garcia and the prohibition of their return by the Government of the United Kingdom so that the United States could construct a large military base there. This was effected by section 4 of the Immigration Ordinance 1971 of the British Indian Ocean Territory enacted pursuant to section 11(1) of the British Indian Ocean Territory Order, which states: [...] "The Commissioner [...] may make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Territory, and such laws shall be published in such manner as the Commissioner may direct." [...] The High Court held that the 1971 Ordinance was ultra vires the Order, since removing a people from their homeland could not be regarded as within {{the power to make}} laws for the territory's [...] "peace, order and good government". Subsequently, the exclusion of the Chagossians from the land was reimposed by an Order in Council, the British Indian Ocean Territory (Constitution) Order 2004, which was made in the exercise of the royal prerogative. The legality of this Order was upheld by the House of Lords in R. (Bancoult) v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No. 2) (2008), which overruled the earlier decision. The House of Lords took the view that the phrase [...] "peace, order and good government" [...] did not entitle the courts to substitute their own view on what the phrase required for that of the Government. Laws made pursuant to it were therefore not <b>justiciable.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The opinion {{stated that}} the case was <b>justiciable,</b> {{and it did not}} {{constitute}} a political question that pitted one branch of government against another. Rather, it required [...] "no more than an interpretation of the Constitution." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{areas of}} high policy such as {{national}} security do not automatically apply as a [...] "plea in bar". On scrutiny of such cases which are prima facie non-justiciable, the courts {{may be able}} to glean a question of law that is <b>justiciable.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Baker v. Carr, , was a {{landmark}} United States Supreme Court case that decided that redistricting (attempts {{to change the}} way voting districts are delineated) issues present <b>justiciable</b> questions, thus enabling federal courts to intervene in and to decide redistricting cases. The defendants unsuccessfully argued that redistricting of legislative districts is a [...] "political question", and hence not a question that may be resolved by federal courts.|$|E
2500|$|The court {{stressed}} {{that it was}} only calling for the case to go forward, and was not itself judging the cases merits, saying [...] "The sole issue presented by this appeal is whether either plaintiff has presented a <b>justiciable</b> controversy in their complaint. We conclude the complaint is sufficient to entitle both plaintiffs to litigate their claims under the Declaratory Judgment Act, though we are careful to express no opinion on the merits of those claims." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{opinion was}} finally handed down in March 1962, {{nearly a year}} after it was {{initially}} argued.

Brennan, three concurring opinions and two dissenting opinions. Brennan reformulated the political question doctrine, identifying six factors to help in determining which questions were [...] "political" [...] in nature.

2500|$|United States v.

While this decision did not have many broad implications, it did offer a more [...] "common-sense" [...] understanding of determining what constitutes a <b>justiciable</b> controversy.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are three}} levels of the Ohio state judiciary. The lowest level is the court of common pleas: each county {{maintains}} its own constitutionally mandated court of common pleas, which maintain jurisdiction over [...] "all <b>justiciable</b> matters". The intermediate-level court system is the district court system. Twelve courts of appeals exist, each retaining jurisdiction over appeals from common pleas, municipal, and county courts in a set geographical area. A case heard in this system is decided by a three-judge panel, and each judge is elected.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{declared}} redistricting issues <b>justiciable</b> in Baker, {{the court}} {{laid out a}} new test for evaluating such claims. The Court formulated the famous [...] "one person, one vote" [...] standard under American jurisprudence for legislative redistricting, holding that each individual had to be weighted equally in legislative apportionment. This affected numerous state legislatures that had not redistricted congressional districts for decades, despite major population shifts. It also ultimately affected the composition of state legislative districts as well, which in Alabama and numerous other states had overrepresented rural districts and underrepresented urban districts with much greater populations.|$|E

This was also longstanding policy of the former Progressive Party dating back to the report of their Molteno Commission of the early 1960s.

The plaintiff members of Congress asserted that military action without {{a declaration of war}} would be unlawful under U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 11 of the United States Constitution. [...] Dellums is notable in that it is one of only a few cases in which the Federal Courts have considered whether the War Powers Clause of the U.S. Constitution is <b>justiciable</b> in the courts. The Court in Dellums indicated that, in that instance, it was, but because Congress had not yet acted as a majority, the lawsuit was premature.|$|E
2500|$|The {{legislative}} amendments {{were intended}} to revert the law to its position before Chng Suan Tze was decided, thus rendering the exercise of power by the President and the Minister under the ISA not <b>justiciable</b> by the courts. In addition, {{the addition of a}} reference to Articles 11 and 12 of the Constitution to Article 149(1) ensured that the ISA is valid even if it is inconsistent with five out of the eight fundamental liberties enshrined in Part IV of the Constitution. Parliament was able to pass these legislative amendments without difficulty to diminish the effect of Chng Suan Tze because a large majority of the Members of Parliament belong to one political party, the People's Action Party. Further, Singapore has a unicameral legislature, so all legislative power is concentrated in one body. The legislative body is [...] "practically fused with the executive via the Cabinet".|$|E

Upon an application by the detainees for habeas corpus, the High Court held that the President, when acting on Cabinet's advice to detain a person under the ISA, exercises a subjective discretion as to whether the person is a risk to national security, which is not <b>justiciable</b> by the courts. Although the judgment was later disapproved by the Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze v.
