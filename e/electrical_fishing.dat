During its planning and construction, issues arose regarding the unwantedentrainment and transport of nonindigenous fishes and other aquatic biota into, through, and outof the canal. One control strategy was the emplacement of <b>electrical</b> <b>fish</b> barriers on two CAPdistributary canals to prevent fishes from moving upstream into the Gila River drainage. Theoperation, maintenance, and effectiveness of these barriers are described for the period 1988 - 2000. Documented outages totalled more than 100 h, representing less than 0. 001 % downtimesince installation. It is nearly certain that outages allowed immigration by undesired fish(es). Immigrations that occurred when the barriers were operating according to design criteria indicatethat the barriers do not totally block the passage of upstream-migrating fish. The proximatesources of electrical barrier outage included component damage from lightning strikes,component breakdowns, failure to adhere to component maintenance and replacementschedules, failure to incorporate adequate protection and redundancies to certain systemcomponents, inadequate training of personnel, and unknown causes.

40|$|The {{protection}} of fish communities at man-made facilities and barriers {{has a long}} history of significant expenditure of scientific and monetary resources. Beyond creating fishways, considerable investment is made to protect fish by blocking their access to turbines, water intakes, and directing them to less risky areas. Nevertheless, guiding fish to the fish passages, especially in downstream direction still present a big problem. The anticipated success of <b>electrical</b> <b>fish</b> barriers and guidance structures has been limited due to current design limitations. However, a device with a fundamentally new design feature has been successfully deployed in Poland. The device is called 2 ̆ 2 NEPTUN 2 ̆ 2. NEPTUN is an electric-electronic 3 -phase barrier, producing a smooth non-uniform pulsed electric field of low voltage. It uses arrays of positive and negative electrodes and gradually increases the intensity of the electric field between the electrodes from positive to negative. Unlike other devices NEPTUN does not stun fish, but affects their neuromuscular system at the informational level, allowing them to escape from the area of the electric field. The basic field installation consists of steel electrodes attached to the river bottom so that they can move from the vertical to an angle of + / - 90 degrees. A buoy attached at the end of the electrode keeps it in an upright position. Groups of electrodes are powered by remotely controlled generators. Specialized software controls the parameters of the electric field, creates statistically-mastered changes, and controls the switching of each group of electrodes. The system supports sensors for monitoring temperature and conductivity of the water which can be used to automatically adjust the properties of the electric field. With an average power input of 0. 43 to 0. 45 kWh and electricity consumption of 0. 0018 kW/m 2, 2 ̆ 2 NEPTUN 2 ̆ 2 has a low operating cost. Additionally, the system maintenance is minimal...|$|R

Samplings were carried out from July 2007 to June 2008 using <b>electrical</b> <b>fishing.</b> Fish were identified, measured and their stomach contents identified and quantified. Spatial variations (among longitudinal stretches) in the diet were summarized using a principal coordinate analysis (PCoA).

Allochthonous resources had the highest percentage of the A. aff. fasciatus diet in all stretches; however, the increased importance of autochthonous resources in the fish diet in the stream mouths made these stretches to differ significantly from the middle and headwater ones. The ordination analysis separated the fish diet sampled in the stream mouth from the diet of most fish samples in the headwater and middle stretches. The results highlight the importance of allochthonous resources, mainly insects, in the diet of A. aff. fasciatus. However, the diet was affected by longitudinal gradient and followed the pattern described for these ecosystems, where fish depend basically of allochthonous material in the headwaters and the importance of these resources decrease along the longitudinal gradient...|$|E

40|$|The bleak Alburnus alburnus (L.) is a cyprinid species inhabiting mainly lentic environments. Its diet {{is based}} on {{zooplankton}} and land insects and its reproductive period takes place during the seasons of spring and summer. This species, native to most of Europe, {{was introduced in the}} Iberian Peninsula in the 90 ’s, where it has spread becoming invasive. On the one hand, this study expects to examine the biological treats of one native population of bleak from Saône River, located at east of France. On the other hand, the aim is to compare this species biological treats with other native populations from the southeast of France (Chappaz et al., 1987) and introduced populations in the Iberian Peninsula. Specifically, populations from the Catalonia internal basins (Masó, 2012), from the Atlantic slope rivers and from river Ebro (Latorre, 2013). The specimens were captured by <b>electrical</b> <b>fishing,</b> during the spring of 2014. Lately, the specimens were processed in the laboratory so it was possible to analyse the following biological traits: total length (TL), total weight (TW), gonads weight (WG), minimum length at maturity (Lmm) for females, sex ratio, gonadosomatic index (GSI) and Le Cren (LK) and Fulton (K) index condition. Moreover, population size and age structure were determined too and fecundity and mean egg diameter were determined for females. It seems that the ecological conditions of the basin are determinant of the populations’ status. After comparing the populations, it can be deduced that in stable lentic environments, bleak establishes easily and presents a minimum length at maturity similar to the native ones and low values of GSI and gonads weight. However, in changeable environments, the populations are under expansion phase, with a lower minimum length at maturity and a higher reproductive potential. Thus, although the population from Saône River presents high values of GSI and gonads weight, the females’ minimum length of maturation allows for deducing that the population could be well established. Between native populations, the one from Saône River shows lower fecundity values and less growth. The results suggest that these biological treats are determined by various factors, such as bleak’s diet, among others. Additionally, the zone of the river where bleak is found could be another determining factor for growth and fecundity. Moreover, the differences observed in the maximum ages of each population could be explained by the mentioned factors and the environmental conditions of the zon...|$|E

40|$|Electrofishing {{is the use}} of {{electricity}} to capture fish. The response of fish to pulsed direct current (DC) occurs in five phases, as shown in Figure 4. 5.

Each pulse of electrical current in a pulsed DC field causes the fish’s body to flex; it then relaxes between each of the pulses.

Pulsed DC causes tetany and narcosis at a much lower voltage gradient than continuous DC, so this is the preferred current delivery (Brousseau et al. 2005).

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2003 Electrofishing {{has served}} as an {{efficient}} method for scientific sampling of freshwater fishes since the mid- 1900 s, but it has become apparent since the 1990 's that electroshock can cause fish injury. Electroshock-induced fish injury (damage to hard or soft tissues), which is primarily manifested as vertebral fracture or hemorrhage (broken blood vessels) along the backbone, can be a critical determinant of fish survival. The ability to predict factors influencing fish injury rate (the proportion of. injured fish in a sample) would be very useful to biologists. To test the null hypothesis of no effect of electrical waveform (W), voltage gradient (E), and fish size (S) on injury rate, I conducted controlled electroshock experiments on chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, rainbow trout O. mykiss, channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus, largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, and hybrid striped bass Morone saxatalis x M. chrysops. Data collected included <b>electrical</b> stimulus, <b>fish</b> behavioral response (R), length (L) and weight (W), and injury status (present/absent). Vertebral injury was determined using radiography, and hemorrhage by bilateral filleting. My model selection criteria, {{which was based on}} Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), indicated that risks for both types of injury in chinook salmon and channel catfish were best represented by the (W, E, S) model, the (W, S) model for both types of injury in rainbow trout, the (W, E) model for hemorrhage and the (W, E, S) model for vertebral injury in largemouth bass, the (W) model for both injury types in hybrid striped bass, and, that risk for injury in bluegill injury was best described by the null model (no effect of W, E, S). A mechanistic model relating electrical stimulus, the force of contraction, and the resistance to contraction to electroshock-induced injury, using (R) as a surrogate for electrical stimulus, (L) as a surrogate for force of contraction, and vertebral count (V) as a surrogate of resistance to injury, was explored. Application of the mechanistic model (R, L, V) to the pooled data set demonstrated a strong predictive relationship. This model offers guidance for the reduction and prevention of electroshock-induced injury for all species in all situations...|$|R

Since the fish remained conscious after landing and storage, electrical stunning and subsequent killing with a throat cut, may provide an option for improving fish welfare on-board commercial fishing vessels.

40|$|The {{application}} of <b>electrical</b> pulses in <b>fishing</b> gear {{is considered a}} promising option to increase the sustainability of demersal trawl fisheries. In the electrotrawl fishery for brown shrimp Crangon crangon, an electrical field selectively induces a startle response in the shrimp. Other benthic organisms remain mainly on the seafloor and escape underneath a hovering trawl. Previous experiments have indicated that this pulse has no short-term major harmful effects on adult fish and invertebrates. However, the impact on young marine life stages is still unknown. Because brown shrimp are caught in shallow coastal zones and estuaries, which serve as important nurseries or spawning areas {{for a wide range}} of marine species, electrotrawling on these grounds could harm embryos, larvae, and juveniles. We carried out experiments with different developmental stages of Atlantic Cod Gadus morhua, which are considered vulnerable to electrical pulses. Three embryonic stages, four larval stages, and one juvenile stage of Atlantic Cod were exposed to a homogeneous electrical field of 150 V-peak/m for 5 s, mimicking a worst-case scenario. We detected no significant differences in embryo mortality rate between control and exposed groups. However, for the embryonic stage exposed at 18 d postfertilization, the initial hatching rate was lower. Larvae that were exposed at 2 and 26 d posthatch exhibited higher mortality rates than the corresponding nonexposed control groups. In the other larval and juvenile stages, no short-term impact of exposure on survival was observed. Morphometric analysis of larvae and juveniles revealed no differences in measurements or deformations of the yolk, notochord, eye, or head. Although exposure to a worst-case electrical field did not impact survival or development for six of the eight young life stages of Atlantic Cod, the observed delayed hatching rate and decreased survival for larvae might indicate an impact of electric pulses and warrant further research...|$|R

As a result, Smith-Root, Incorporated (SRI; Vancouver, Washington), manufacturers of electrofishing and closely-related equipment, proposed a project to evaluate the potential of an electrical barrier to deter marine mammals and {{reduce the amount of}} predation on adult salmonids (SRI 2007). The objectives of their work were to develop, deploy, and evaluate a passive, integrated sonar and electric barrier that would selectively inhibit the upstream movements of marine mammals and reduce predation, but would not injure pinnipeds or impact anadromous fish migrations. However, before such a device could be deployed in the field, concerns by regional fishery managers about the potential effects of such a device on the migratory behavior of Pacific salmon, steelhead O. mykiss, Pacific lampreys Entoshpenus tridentata, and white sturgeon Acipenser transmontanus, needed to be addressed. In this report, we describe the results of laboratory research designed to evaluate the effects of prototype electric barriers on adult steelhead and Pacific lampreys. The effects of electricity on fish have been widely studied and include injury or death (e. g., Sharber and Carothers 1988; Dwyer et al. 2001; Snyder 2003), physiological dysfunction (e. g., Schreck et al. 1976; Mesa and Schreck 1989), and altered behavior (Mesa and Schreck 1989). Much of this work was done to investigate the effects of electrofishing on fish in the wild. Because electrofishing operations would always use more severe electrical settings than those proposed for the pinniped barrier, results from these studies are probably not relevant to the work proposed by SRI. Field electrofishing operations typically use high voltage and amperage settings and a variety of waveforms, pulse widths (PW), and pulse frequencies (PF), depending on conditions and target species. For example, when backpack electrofishing for trout in a small stream, one might use settings such as 500 V pulsed DC, a PW of 1 ms, and a PF of 60 Hz. In contrast, the electrical barrier proposed by SRI will produce electrical conditions significantly lower than those used in electrofishing, particularly for PW and PF (e. g., PW ranging from 300 - 1, 000 {micro}s and PF from 2 - 3 Hz). Further, voltage gradients (in V/cm) are predicted to be lower in the electric barrier than those produced during typical electrofishing. Although the relatively weak, pulsed DC electric fields to be produced by the barrier may be effective at deterring pinnipeds, little, if anything, is known about the effects of such low intensity <b>electrical</b> fields on <b>fish</b> behavior. For this research, we evaluated the effects of weak, pulsed DC electric currents on the behavior of adult steelhead and Pacific lamprey and the incidence of injury in steelhead only. In a series of laboratory experiments, we: (1) documented the rate of passage of fish over miniature, prototype electric barriers when they were on and off; (2) determined some electric thresholds beyond which fish would not pass over the barrier; and (3) assessed the incidence and severity of injury in steelhead exposed to relatively severe electrical conditions. The results of this study should be useful for making decisions about whether to install electrical barriers in the lower Columbia River, or elsewhere, to reduce predation on upstream migrating salmonids and other fishes by marine pinnipeds...|$|R
