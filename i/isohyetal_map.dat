Analyzing the history of drought events is fundamental to establish potential risks of the occurrence of droughts in the future. One of the many ways to prevent substantial impacts and evaluate a drought risk assessment is through analysis of severity, duration and frequency characteristics of these events. In this context, the current study developed Severity-Duration-Frequency curves and derived an <b>isohyetal</b> <b>map</b> for the area influenced by the semi-arid climate in the state of Minas Gerais, through the analysis of 17 rainfall stations. The drought events identification and the analysis of its conditions were assessed using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for a 12 -month time scale.

It will be help to realize the spatial distribution of soil and water resources and movement of sedimentation for our homeland by studying the spatial variations of typhoon rainfall. Watershed is a unit of topography and an elementary area that applied for the topics of spatial hydrology and sediment movement. This study first used the first law of geography and nonparametric statistics test, and then chose 19 rain gauge stations to analyze the spatial variations of typhoon rainfalls by areal reduction factor curves in the Nam Shih Creek watershed of Northern Taiwan for different durations and return periods. The results of typhoon rainfall spatial distribution from semivariograms analysis of different durations and return periods showed that the range is about 7. 4 km, and the spatial variation increasing by durations and return periods under the range in this site. The semivariogram models built by former analysis used as the input functions for Kriging that making <b>isohyetal</b> <b>maps</b> by integrating GIS. From the <b>isohyetal</b> <b>maps,</b> we can display the spatial distribution of rainfall caused by typhoons in Nan Shih Creek watershed. The spatial distributions of typhoon rainfall lessen gradually from east to west and south to north in this area. Such being the cases, the apparent spatial variations of typhoon rainfall is in the eastern and southern parts of this watershed. For the sake of understanding the relationship between typhoon rainfall degradation and area of distribution, this study applied the <b>isohyetal</b> <b>maps</b> that drawn in the former part to extract areal reduction factors of different durations and return periods, and forming the areal reduction factor curves. As a result of areal reduction factor curves, the areal reduction factors of typhoon rainfalls decayed with accumulative areas of spatial distribution by the power law. The areal reduction factor curves decrease mildly with the rainfall durations on increasing in the fixed return period. In the condition of fixed durations, the areal reduction factor curves also grow less mildly with the return periods extend.

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Shallow, {{translational}} landslides occur naturally and are {{the dominant}} form of erosion in the Pacific Northwest and the Oregon Coast Range. These landslides are triggered during large, infrequent storms. Forest management activities, such as timber harvesting, can exacerbate the occurrence of these landslides. Understanding {{the relationship between the}} occurrence of shallow, translational landslides and the temporal and spatial variability of short duration, high intensity rainfall is an important step to understanding how to manage landslide-prone forested terrain. Rainfall intensity data collected during the last 14 years from a network of 13 tipping bucket rain gauges were analyzed to characterize the rainfall regime of the central Oregon Coast Range. Partial duration analysis was carried out to determine the 2 -, 5 -, 10 -, 25 -, 50 -, and 100 -year return period antecedent precipitation index (API) and rainfall intensities for the 30 -minute, 1 -, 2 -, 6 -, 12 -, and 24 -hour rainfall durations. The Spearman Rank Correlation method was used to determine if patterns existed in the relative rank of rainfall intensities across the study area. <b>Isohyetal</b> <b>maps</b> of rainfall intensity for each unique combination of rainfall duration and return period were also developed. Analysis of the rainfall intensity data showed that rainfall intensity was highly variable across the study area, although the variability across the study area was fairly constant. The coefficient of variation in average rainfall intensity across the study area was approximately 20 percent. The Spearman Rank Correlation method showed that patterns in rainfall occurred across the study area and that these patterns were consistent for all rainfall durations and return periods. In other words, the rain gauge locations that got the most rainfall were the wettest regardless of rainfall duration or return period and {{the same is true for}} the rain gauge locations that received the least amount of rainfall. Examination of the <b>isohyetal</b> <b>maps</b> showed that all of the variability in rainfall intensity occurred within the minimum distances between rain gauge locations, which is 10 to 15 km.

DAD curves exhibit the depth and the area covered by the rainfall with a particular duration. DAD analysis is widely used in characterization of precipitation extremes for specification of so-called design storms. In this study the DAD curves for the Kurdistan province were prepared and investigated. To obtain the rainfall rate for different parts of the region for time durations of 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours, the daily rainfall data from the stations of the Ministry of Energy were studied first and the rainfall data for durations of one to four days were extracted afterward. 19 storms were then selected for the four time durations according to the rule of extensive rainfalls. The rainfall data from the interior meteorology stations and from some of the stations of the neighborhood provinces at the same occurrence time of the last storms were extracted and recorded according to their termination time. In order to determine the average of maximum rainfall depths for different durations for each storm, calculations were performed using isohyetal maps which were prepared by ‘Moving Average ’ method. The initial DAD curves were then prepared using those calculations. Since the maximum rainfall is needed, the initial DAD curves for each duration were combined to obtain a final DAD curve, which is basically the envelope depth-area curve for the corresponding duration. This procedure was performed for all four time durations and ultimately four final DAD curves, one per each time duration, were produced.

30|$|A {{regional}} approach to rainfall frequency analysis attempts {{to supplement the}} limited information available from the relatively short periods of record with regional information from surrounding stations (Smithers and Schulze 2000). The reality is that in nearly all the practical situations a regional method is {{proved to be more}} efficient than the application of an at-site analysis (Potter, 1987).

40|$|A common {{existing}} {{approach to}} modeling rainfall extremes employs a spatial Bayesian hierarchical model, where latent Gaussian processes are specified on distributional parameters {{in order to}} pool spatial information. The data are taken to be conditionally independent given the latent processes, and so spatial dependence arises only through this conditional structure. This methodology can be extended by incorporating an explicit max-stable dependence structure, which therefore produces more realistic spatial surfaces, and removes the assumption of conditional independence. We further extend the max-stable methodology to incorporate the joint modeling of rainfall data at different accumulation durations. We therefore pool information across both space and accumulation duration within a broad framework which includes an explicit specification of spatial dependence.

We create a simplified representation of the spatial layout of extreme events based on a new digital archive of UK rainfall. This simplification allows a Bayesian clustering algorithm to compress these representations down to eight prototypical patterns of extreme falls. These patterns are then verified against a five-class, manual, subjective typing scheme, produced independently using known meteorological mechanisms, <b>isohyetal</b> <b>maps</b> and additional descriptive text from the archive. Compared against the manual scheme, the new objective scheme can reproduce the known meteorological conditions, both in terms of spatial layout and seasonal timing, and is shown to be of hydrological relevance when matched to several notable flooding events in the past century. Furthermore, it is computationally simple and straightforward to apply in classifying future extreme rainfall events. We discuss the practical use of this new typing scheme in flood simulations and climate change applications. Citation: Little, M. A., Rodda, H. J. E. & McSharry, P. E. (2008).

40|$|A {{procedure}} for estimating runoff from convective storms in the semiarid Southwest {{is needed for}} the design of small hydraulic structures. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop and test rainfall and runoff relationships based on the analysis of 12 years of hydrologic data for an 18 -square mile experimental watershed. rhe experimental area is divided into four subwatersheds ranging in size from 0. 5 to 7. 8 square miles, Vegetation and soils are typical of what is encountered in the valley floors of southern Arizona. Rainfall is measured at 29 locations. <b>Isohyetal</b> <b>maps</b> were prepared for all of the storms which lead to the development of a rainfall model that describes the distribution of rainfall in space. An exponential relationship was found to adequately represent the spatial variation of each storm. A single equation for all storms was developed by using a parameter that is related to the storm center depth. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov procedure was used to test the hypothesis that storm center location is governed by chance in areas not influenced by topographic changes. It was found that the assumption which states that convective storm cells are randomly located within valley floors is acceptable. An equation was derived for calculating point rainfall probabilities from raingage network data, The results were based on the random location of storm centers and on an extremal distribution function fitted to storm center depths. The calculated probabilities were found to be significantly higher than the observed probabilities determined from a nearby, long-term U. S. Weather Bureau station. The volume of runoff from small, semiarid watersheds was found to be a function primarily of mean rainfall. In a multiple linear regression model, mean rainfall accounted for 67 to 82 percent of the variance. The use of a time distribution factor which includes the maximum 15 -minute intensity reduced the unexplained variance to 11 to 16 percent. Inserting a space distribution variable into the model indicated that storm center location on the watershed was not a significant factor in predicting runoff. An antecedent rainfall index did not produce any significant correlation with runoff from convective storms. For winter frontal storms, however, a four-day antecedent rainfall index was found to be an important factor in oxplaining runoff. It appears that the commonly used Soil Conservation Service method underestimates convective storm runoff for most storm center depths below about three inches. A direct comparison with the multiple regression equation was not possible as this method does not take into account the variability of convective rainfall in time and space. As a means for estimating runoff volumes for ungaged watersheds, a runoff coefficient was defined as the ratio of runoff to effective rainfall (mean rainfall less initial abstractions). It appears that as a first approximation, the runoff coefficient can be considered as being equal to the coefficient in the well known rational formula. There is some evidence to the belief that the runoff coefficient is affected by a storm's time distribution factor. It was demonstrated that runoff volume recurrence intervals can be determined adequately from the rainfall and runoff relationships developed in this study...|$|R
40|$|Studies of the {{hydrogeology}} of {{the southern}} Great Basin differ widely in their conclusions regarding the origin of major springs at Ash Meadows, in the Amargosa Desert, Nevada, and in the Furnace Creek- Nevares Spring area in Death Valley, California. The diversity of opinion reflects the following. First, ground water commonly moves between intermontane basins of the region via thick, highly fractured, and areally extensive Paleozoic carbonate rocks; the resulting lack of correspondence of topographic and ground-water divides precludes routine utilization of the water-budget method {{in the study of}} these basins. Second, subsurface hydraulic data for the regional carbonate aquifer are sparse and difficult to interpret because of the complex subsurface disposition of and hydraulic barriers within the aquifer. An analysis of hydrologic, geologic, geochemical, and isotopic data permits a first approximation of the subsurface watershed tributary to the cited spring groups. Water temperature, chemistry, isotope content, hydraulic head, and geologic relations indicate that the major springs at Ash Meadows and in the Furnace Creek-Nevares Spring area, though emerging from unconsolidated Quaternary strata, are fed by water moving directly from the underlying carbonate aquifer of Paleozoic age. Joint use of potentiometric, geologic, and <b>isohyetal</b> <b>maps</b> indicates that the subsurface watershed tributary to Ash Meadows is no smaller than 4, 500 square miles. The Ash Meadows ground-water basin is bordered on the south and east by the Spring Mountains and Sheep Range, the principal recharge areas, and on the west by the Belted Range, Eleana Range, and Shoshone Mountain. A northern boundary was not definable, and some underflow from White River ground-water basin, 90 miles northeast of the springs, is probable. The hydrogeologic data do not support the conclusion of earlier studies that underflow from Pahrump Valley is the major source of the spring discharge at Ash Meadows; probably {{no more than a few}} percent of the total comes from that valley. Comparison of the size, climate, and discharge from the Ash Meadows basin with that of the surface watershed tributary to the Furnace Creek-Nevares Spring area indicates that most of the spring discharge in east-central Death Valley originates well beyond its confines. Disposition of the carbonate aquifer favors the movement of ground water into Death Valley from central Amargosa Desert. Water in the carbonate aquifer in the latter area may be derived from the Ash Meadows basin, from the overlying valley fill, or both. Five hydrochemical facies were distinguished by percentage of major cations and anions in ground water from 147 sources. The hydrochemical facies reflect both the mineralogy of strata within recharge areas and downward crossflow from a Tertiary tuff aquitard into the carbonate aquifer. The areal distribution of these facies provides evidence for a northeasterly source of the Ash Meadows discharge, absence of significant underflow from Pahrump Valley to Ash Meadows, and movement of water from the central Amargosa Desert to the Furnace Creek- Nevares Spring area. The data are also compatible with southwestward underflow into the Ash Meadows basin from the White River basin. The deuterium content of 53 water samples from 27 major valleylevel springs and selected wells falls into several areally distinct patterns which suggest that 35 percent of the Ash Meadows discharge is derived from the White River basin, that underflow from Pahrump Valley is unlikely, and that water discharging in the Furnace Creek-Nevares Spring area may be related to water in the carbonate aquifer within the Ash Meadows basin. However, other interpretations are possible indicating that unequivocal interpretations about the regional flow system cannot be made from isotopic data alone...|$|R

Improvements were designed to incorporate spatial variability within recharge areas (rather than recharge as a lumped parameter), develop a more defendable lower limit of recharge, and differentiate local recharge from recharge emanating as interbasin flux. Seventeen springs, located in the Sheep Range, Spring Mountains, and on the Nevada Test Site were sampled during the course of this study and their discharge was measured. The chloride and bromide concentrations of the springs were determined. Discharge and chloride concentrations from these springs were compared to estimates provided by previously published reports. A literature search yielded previously published estimates of chloride flux to the land surface. {sup 36 }Cl/Cl ratios and discharge rates of the three largest springs in the Amargosa Springs discharge area were compiled from various sources. This information was utilized to determine an effective chloride concentration for recharging precipitation and its associated uncertainty via Monte Carlo simulations. Previously developed <b>isohyetal</b> <b>maps</b> were utilized to determine the mean and standard deviation of precipitation within the area. A digital elevation model was obtained to provide elevation information. A geologic model was obtained to provide the spatial distribution of alluvial formations. Both were used to define the lower limit of recharge. In addition, 40 boreholes located in alluvial sediments were drilled and sampled in an attempt to support the argument that the areal distribution of alluvial sediments can be used to define a zone of negligible recharge. The data were compiled in a geographic information system and used in a Monte Carlo analysis to determine recharge occurring within the study area. Results of the analysis yielded estimates of the mean and standard deviation of recharge occurring within the study area (28. 168 x 10 {sup 6 } m{sup 3 } yr{sup - 1 } and 7. 008 x 10 {sup 6 } m{sup 3 } yr{sup - 1 }, and 26. 838 x 10 {sup 6 } m{sup 3 } yr{sup - 1 } and 6. 928 x 10 {sup 6 } m{sup 3 } yr{sup - 1 }) for two sets of simulations using alternate definitions of the lower limit of recharge. A sensitivity analysis determined the recharge estimates were most sensitive to uncertainty associated with the chloride concentration of the spring discharge. The second most sensitive parameter was the uncertainty associated with the mean precipitation within the recharge areas. Comparison of the analysis to previously published estimates of recharge revealed mixed results with the recharge estimates derived during the course of this project generally greater relative to previously published estimates...|$|R
40|$|Almost all runoff-producing {{rainfall}} {{on small}} watersheds (100 square miles and less) in southeastern Arizona results from air-mass thunderstorms. On large watersheds (1, 000 square miles and greater) frontal systems which may include thunderstorm activity or snowmelt produce the major flood peaks {{as well as}} much of the annual runoff. Air-mass thunderstorms are of short duration and limited areal extent, and generally occur in the late afternoons and early evenings in July, August, and September. Runoff-producing rainfall may occur from frontal-convective systems at any time although they are most common in southeastern Arizona in September. Rainfall and runoff records have been collected from the 58 - square-mile Walnut Gulch rangeland watershed near Tombstone in southeastern Arizona by the Agricultural Research Service since 1954. These data represent the best information available on thunderstorm rainfall-runoff relationships in the Southwest. At present there are 95 recording rain gages and 22 permanent runoff-measuring stations on the Walnut Gulch watershed. Runoff-producing thunderstorm rainfall is extremely variable both in time and space, and is therefore difficult to measure accurately and define precisely. <b>Isohyetal</b> <b>mapping</b> for rainfall from individual thunderstorms both for total rainfall and shorter durations within the storm provides good qualitative information, and also provides some quantitative limits on storm movement, intensities and volumes, and areal extent. Runoff records from Walnut Gulch and other Arizona watersheds indicate that peak discharge and runoff volume from individual thunderstorms decrease with increasing watershed size because of the limited areal extent of runoff-producing thunderstorms and because cf the increasing channel abstractions with increasing watershed size. Channel abstractions greatly alter runoff hydrographs as flood surges move through the ephemeral channel system. Five major runoff-producing thunderstorms on Walnut Gulch between 1957 and 1967 were used to develop a model for the maximum expected rainfall in southeastern Arizona. The model was based on maximum 30 -minute point rainfalls within the average 60 -minute runoff-producing thunderstorm. Over 2. 5 inches of rainfall has been recorded in 30 minutes on Walnut Gulch during 3 thunderstorms in 15 years of record (1955 - 1969). A thorough search of U. S. Weather Bureau and other records indicated that no storms of this combined intensity and magnitude have been recorded in Arizona. Therefore, for design purposes, the expected mean 30 -minute rainfall for southeastern Arizona was estimated as 3 inches. Regression analysis was used to estimate peak discharges for major runoff events on Walnut Gulch and to develop a rainfall-runoff model for Walnut Gulch. Peak discharges were correlated with the maximum 30 -minute rainfall, which was considered the core of runoff-producing rainfall for major runoff events. Antecedent channel conditions and distance between watershed outlet and runoff-producing rainfall had little effect on the correlation. The coefficients of determination for the regression equation correlating thunderstorm rainfall and peak runoff were 0. 92 and o. 84 for watershed 5 (8 square miles) and watershed 1 (58 square miles), respectively. With the model for maximum expected rainfall and the rainfall-runoff model for estimating peak discharge from maximum 30 -minute rainfall, maximum discharge for the 58 -square-mile Walnut Gulch watershed was 23, 000 c. f. s. Assuming a normal distribution of errors, within 95 percent confidence limits, the limits were 19, 000 and 27, 000 c. f. s., and assuming the Chebyshev inequality, the limits were 15, 000 and 31, 000 c. f. s. Recurrence intervals for 20 -, 50 -, and 100 -year storms and the maximum peak discharges were developed for small watersheds (100 square miles and less) from Walnut Gulch data. The curves were compared to a family of curves for Arizona watersheds up to several hundred thousand square miles. The family of curves based on Walnut Gulch data were much steeper, strongly suggesting that there are 2 families of curves, one steeper family for the small watersheds (100 square miles and less) which is based on runoff peaks from air-mass thunderstorms, and another flatter family of curves for the large watersheds (1, 000 square miles and greater) which is based on runoff peaks from frontal-convective systems and snowmelt. The 2 families of curves probably intersect between 100 and 1, 000 square miles...|$|R
