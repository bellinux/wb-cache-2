5000|$|On a {{conventional}} loom, the weft thread {{is carried on}} a pirn, in a shuttle that passes through the shed. A handloom weaver could propel the shuttle by throwing it {{from side to side}} {{with the aid of a}} picking stick. The [...] "picking΅ on a power loom is done by rapidly hitting the shuttle from each side using an overpick or underpick mechanism controlled by cams 80-250 times a minute. [...] When a pirn is depleted, it is ejected from the shuttle and replaced with the next pirn held in a battery attached to the loom. Multiple shuttle boxes allow more than one shuttle to be used. Each can carry a different colour which allows banding across the loom.The rapier-type weaving machines do not have shuttles, they propel the weft by means of small grippers or rapiers that pick up the <b>filling</b> <b>thread</b> and carry it halfway across the loom where another rapier picks it up and pulls it the rest of the way. [...] Some carry the filling yarns across the loom at rates in excess of 2,000 metres per minute. Manufacturers such as Picanol have reduced the mechanical adjustments to a minimum, and control all the functions through a computer with a graphical user interface. Other types use compressed air to insert the pick. They are all fast, versatile and quiet.|$|E

BREIN president Tim Kuik alleged in a Dutch newspaper that “Although they FTD are not carrying illegal content on their servers, what FTD does is simply criminal”. FTD is suing for a retraction of this libelous statement and demands a declaration from the courts that its activities are entirely within the law.|$|R

5000|$|Weaving is {{a method}} of textile {{production}} in which two distinct sets of yarns or threads are interlaced {{at right angles to}} form a fabric or cloth. Other methods are knitting, crocheting, felting, and braiding or plaiting. The longitudinal threads are called the warp and the lateral threads are the weft or filling. (Weft or woof is an old English word meaning [...] "that which is woven".) The method in which these threads are inter-woven affects the characteristics of the cloth.Cloth is usually woven on a loom, a device that holds the warp threads in place while <b>filling</b> <b>threads</b> are woven through them. A fabric band which meets this definition of cloth (warp threads with a weft thread winding between) can also be made using other methods, including tablet weaving, back-strap, or other techniques without looms.|$|R

5000|$|Moire is {{produced}} from two distinctly different methods of finishing. Calendering produces the true moire, known as [...] "moire antique" [...] and [...] "moire Anglaise," [...] {{which is a}} purely physical phenomenon. In calendering, the fabric is folded lengthwise in half with the face side inward, and with the two selvedges running together side by side. To produce moire, ribbed rollers are used, and the ribs produce the watermark effect. The rollers polish the surface and make the fabric smoother and more lustrous. High temperatures and pressure are used as well, and the fabric is often damped before being run through the rollers. The end result is a peculiar luster resulting from the divergent reflection of the light rays on the material, a divergence brought about by compressing and flattening the warp and <b>filling</b> <b>threads</b> in places, thereby forming a surface which reflects light differently. The weft threads also are moved slightly.|$|R

40|$|Sinorhizobium meliloti growth inside {{infection}} threads was monitored after inoculation of alfalfa with red- or green-tagged bacteria. Most threads were {{populated with}} single bacterial types. Mixed infections were present but gave mixed nodules {{less often than}} expected. These patterns are explained by a model describing bacterial growth during infection. Sinorhizobium meliloti cells grow as free-living organisms but also as nitrogen-fixing symbionts inside root nodule cells of alfalfa and related species (2, 4, 10 – 13). Bacteria must get from the root surface to inner root tissue, where they will populate nodule cells. Thus, they grow and divide inside a plant-derived tubule, called an infection thread (7 – 9). Infection threads grow down host root hairs, and S. meliloti grows and divides inside the <b>thread,</b> keeping it <b>filled.</b> The <b>thread</b> branches during growth through root tissue, and bacteria eventually exit the resulting network and enter the cytoplasm of nodule cells. Studies of mixed infections during symbiosis can lead t...|$|R
50|$|In some ways, leavened {{bread is}} a foam, as the yeast causes the bread to rise by {{producing}} tiny bubbles of {{gas in the}} dough. The dough has traditionally been understood as a closed-cell foam, in which the pores do not connect with each other. Cutting the dough releases the gas in the bubbles that are cut, but the gas {{in the rest of}} the dough cannot escape. When dough is allowed to rise too far, it becomes an open-cell foam, in which the gas pockets are connected. Now, if the dough is cut or the surface otherwise broken, a large volume of gas can escape, and the dough collapses. The open structure of an over-risen dough is easy to observe: instead of consisting of discrete gas bubbles, the dough consists of a gas space <b>filled</b> with <b>threads</b> of the flour-water paste. Recent research has indicated that the pore structure in bread is 99% interconnected into one large vacuole, thus the closed-cell foam of the moist dough is transformed into an open cell solid foam in the bread.|$|R

40|$|Ring-shank nails {{are used}} {{extensively}} in post-frame construction {{due to their}} superior performance, yet surprisingly little testing {{has been done on}} nail sizes above 12 d. Experience in the post-frame industry suggests that published allowable design values for ring-shank nails may be overly conservative and need revision. The goal of the research reported herein was to characterize the withdrawal strength of ring-shank nails embedded in Southern Pine lumber. Three sizes ofgalvanized and ungalvanized (bright) ring-shank nails from two manufacturers were studied. Ring-shank nails had approximately twice the withdrawal resistance of smooth-shank nails of the same diameter. Galvanizing slightly reduced withdrawal strength (approximately 8 %) due to partial <b>filling</b> of the <b>threads.</b> Nail head pull-through was studied as a possible failure mode. Even allowing for galvanizing and head pull-through, strong evidence is presentedfor increasing withdrawal design valuesfor ring-shank nails...|$|R
50|$|Silicone-based {{lubricants}} {{are often}} used by consumers in applications where other common consumer lubricants, such as petroleum jelly, would damage certain products, such as latex rubber condoms and gaskets on dry-suits. It {{can be used to}} lubricate fountain pen <b>filling</b> mechanisms and <b>threads.</b> It is used to seal and preserve O-rings in flashlights, plumbing, waterproof watches, and air rifles. Silicone grease is widely used to lubricate threads of water submersible flashlights used for diving and spearfishing. This grease improves water resistance of the flashlights and protects threads from wearing out. Silicone grease is used with waterproof devices as it has a very thick body and doesn't dissolve in water, as most spirits and other liquids would. Silicone-based lubricants are also commonly used for remote control hobbies, or for the insulation of CPU sockets when overclocking at very low temperatures.|$|R
40|$|Much of the {{improvement}} in computer performance over {{the last twenty years}} has come from faster transistors and architectural advances that increase parallelism. Historically, parallelism has been exploited either at the instruction level with a grain-sie of a single instruction or by partitioning applications into coarse threads with grain-sies of thousands of instructions. Fine-grain <b>threads</b> <b>fill</b> the parallelism gap between these extremes by enabling tasks with run lengths as small as 20 cycles. As this fine-g rain parallelism is orthogonal to ILP and coarse threads, it complements both methods and provides an opportunity for greater speedup. This paper describes the efficient communication and synchronization mechanisms implemented in the Multi-ALU Processor (MAP) chip, including a thread creation instruction, register communication, and a hardware barrier. These register-based mechanisms provide 10 times faster communication and 60 times faster synchronization than mechanisms that operate via a shared onchip cache. With a three-processor implementation of the MAP, fine-grain speedups of 1. 2 - 2. 1 are demonstrated on a suite of applications...|$|R
40|$|Demand for Grid {{resources}} {{is expected to}} double during LHC Run II as compared to Run I, {{the capacity of the}} Grid, however, will not double. The HEP community must consider how to bridge this computing gap by targeting larger compute resources and using the available compute resources as efficiently as possible. Argonne's Mira, the fifth fastest supercomputer in the world, can run roughly five times the number of parallel processes that the ATLAS experiment typically uses on the Grid. We ported Alpgen, a serial x 86 code, to run as a parallel application under MPI on the Blue Gene/Q architecture. By analysis of the Alpgen code, we reduced the memory footprint to allow running 64 threads per node, utilizing the four hardware threads available per core on the PowerPC A 2 processor. Event generation and unweighting, typically run as independent serial phases, are coupled together in a single job in this scenario, reducing intermediate writes to the filesystem. By these optimizations, we have successfully run LHC proton-proton physics event generation at the scale of a million <b>threads,</b> <b>filling</b> two-thirds of Mira...|$|R
40|$|Local {{release of}} Mg ions from {{titanium}} implant surfaces {{has been shown}} to enhance implant retention and integration. To clarify the biological events that lead to this positive outcome, threaded implants coated with mesoporous TiO 2 thin films were loaded with Mg-ions and placed in the tibia of rabbits for 3 weeks, after surface characterization. Non-loaded mesoporous coated implants were used as controls. Peri-implant gene expression of a set of osteogenic and inflammatory assays was quantified by means of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The expression of three osteogenic markers (OC, RUNX- 2 and IGF- 1) was significantly more pronounced in the test specimens, suggesting that the release of Mg ions directly at the implant sites may stimulate an osteogenic environment. Furthermore, bone healing around implants was evaluated on histological slides and by diffraction-enhanced imaging (DEI), using synchrotron radiation. The histological analysis demonstrated new bone formation around all implants, without negative responses, with {{a significant increase in the}} number of <b>threads</b> <b>filled</b> with new bone for test surfaces.

40|$|The {{experience}} of operating oil wells {{showed that the}} weak point of tubing is a connecting thread. Currently, the pipe thread of the specified class is made using the technology of cutting. The process of cutting a thread leads to waste metal chips and cutting fibers. Therefore the idea arose to make a thread by the method of pressure shaping. The aim was to study the possibility for full <b>filling</b> of the <b>threaded</b> matrix profile. The study was conducted by means of mathematical modeling in the software complex DEFORM. The impact of technological and geometrical factors {{on the process of}} form change was in detail analyzed. Thus, a work-piece material was specified to be continuous, isotropic, homogeneous, viscous-plastic and a tool material was set as a hard one. The friction was speci-fied according to Prandtl-Siebel law with the friction factor of 0. 3. The thread profile has been replaced by the annular grooves of the similar profile. The task was considered to be axisymmetric. Scientific novelty of received results consists in revealed regularities of the plastic de-formation process of the work-piece when forming a profile of the conical thread on the pipe in the process of its expansion with a conical punch. The simulation allowed us to obtain information about the stress-strain state of the work-piece and tool, {{about the nature of the}} metal flow during deformation, and about the strength parameters of the process. In particular, it was found that the work-piece metal is displaced along the pipe axis both in punch movement direction and in the opposite one. Thus, a mechanical end burr is formed. The article shows that to remove a mechanical end burr requires insertion of extra limit stop housing. The article also analyses distribution of stresses arising in the matrix at the final moment of deformation. It was proved that the highest stresses occur in the hollows of the threaded part of matrix. Thus, their absolute value does not exceed 470 MPa that is quite acceptable for the materials used in the production of stamps. Research has been proven a principle possibility to have the external conical pipe thread by expansion with a conical punch. </p...|$|R
