There is a transition from metallic bonding among the metals on the left of the table through to covalent or Van der Waals (<b>electrostatic)</b> <b>bonding</b> among the nonmetals on the right of the table.

Nonmetallic bonding, towards the right of the table, features open-packed directional (or disordered) structures with fewer or zero nearest neighbours. As noted, this steady reduction in the number of nearest neighbours, as metallic character decreases and nonmetallic character increases, is mirrored among the nonmetals, the structures of which gradually change from polyatomic, to diatomic, to monatomic.|$|E

5000|$|Four values, two E and two C were {{assigned}} as references. EA and CA of I2 were chosen as standards. Since I2 has little tendency to undergo <b>electrostatic</b> <b>bonding,</b> the EA parameter {{was assigned a}} small value, 0.5, while the value of CA for the covalent property was set at 2.0. For the two base parameters, EB for CH3C(O)N(CH3)2 ( [...] DMA) was set at 2.35 and CB for (C2H5)2S, diethyl sulfide, was set at 3.92. Fixing the parameters in this way imposed the covalent- electrostatic model on the data set by fixing the EAEB and CACB products of the DMA and (C2H5)2S adducts with iodine, and these four values ensured {{that none of the}} parameters had negative values. Due to increasing enthalpy data that became available since the EC equation was first proposed the parameters have been improved. A select set of the recommended E and C numbers is found in this article and the complete set is available in the literature [...] Mixing E and C numbers from different sets will result in incorrect calculations and is to be avoided.|$|E
