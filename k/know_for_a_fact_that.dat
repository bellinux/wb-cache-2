500|$|The song created {{controversy}} over the writing credits. Steve Wallace, an Indiana songwriter, claimed he wrote [...] "Sometimes" [...] in 1990, but didn't copyright it until 2003, four years after Spears registered the song's copyright. Wallace claimed Spears confessed he wrote the song, by showing to the court a possible e-mail from the singer, which said, [...] "I now <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> you wrote [...] But there's nothing I can do about it. That's all I can say about it." [...] The e-mail was considered fake and the lawsuit was dismissed on October 31, 2005, when Judge John D. Tinder claimed the singer didn't steal the song.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{contains}} masochistic themes {{and tells the}} story of heartbreak caused by a failed relationship: [...] "Gave you all I had / And you tossed it in the trash". The chorus has Mars singing, [...] "I'd catch a grenade for ya," [...] and speaks of unrequited love when the subject girl of his affections [...] "won't do the same". Tim Byron, writer for The Vine, [...] "'Grenade' is about the feeling of [...] ". The critic added, [...] "Mars knows she is bad for him, that's she's preventing him from thinking straight, that he can't actually have her the way he wants, but he still nonetheless has crazy desires for that rush of romantic cocaine that he gets from her." [...] As Mars commented in an interview to Blues & Soul: [...] "'Grenade' represents the OTHER side of love– where you're in love with a woman and you <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> she doesn't love you the way you love HER." ...|$|E

500|$|Certain {{elements}} of the film were considered to bear a resemblance to a 1960s Japanese anime television series, Jungle Emperor (known as Kimba the White Lion in the United States), with characters having similar analogues, and various individual scenes being similar in composition to the show. Matthew Broderick believed initially that he was, in fact, working on an American version of Kimba since he {{was familiar with the}} Japanese original. However, The Lion King director, Roger Allers, claimed he was unfamiliar with the show: [...] Co-director Rob Minkoff also stated that he was unfamiliar with it: [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> [...] has never been discussed as long as I've been on the project... In my experience, if Disney becomes aware of anything like that, they say you will not do it. People are claiming copyright infringement all the time." [...] He also stated that whenever a story is based in Africa, it is [...] "not unusual to have characters like a baboon, a bird or hyenas." [...] Yoshihiro Shimizu, of Tezuka Productions, which created Kimba the White Lion, has refuted rumors that the studio was paid hush money by Disney but explains that they rejected urges from within the industry to sue because, [...] "we're a small, weak company. It wouldn't be worth it anyway... Disney's lawyers are among the top twenty in the world!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Idol {{producer}} Nigel Lythgoe, who was unimpressed {{with the}} evidence presented on the Primetime Live special, called it [...] "shoddy journalism".

Paula's the den mother. ... I don't have a problem with that.

[...] Lythgoe also questioned why it took two years for Clark to reveal his alleged affair with Abdul, fueling speculation that Clark was merely attempting to gain publicity for his upcoming album.|$|E

60|$|The {{six women}} {{and one man}} {{left behind in the}} little drawing-room began talking as easily as might be after such <b>an</b> occurrence, <b>for</b> though each one of them <b>knew</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> that he or she never talked scandal, each one of them also knew that the other six did; all were {{therefore}} angry and at a loss. James only was silent, disturbed, to the bottom of his soul.|$|R
2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{motivation}}s, Ringer responded [...] "Honestly, my number-one motivation is my family". While talking about his attitude and upbringing, Ringer mentioned, [...] "A lot of that just comes from my upbringing. I have a tremendous mother and father, I {{grew up in the}} church, I have a very religious family. I’m not all about myself just because I know if it wasn’t for God, I wouldn’t be able {{to go out there and}} compete anyway. So I never look at it as a selfish thing—I never want all the attention or want it to be about me, because I never want to get in to a situation where God has to humble me. I <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> I am not doing it by myself; it is because of Him that I can compete over and over again. That’s basically how I grew up. I was blessed and fortunate to have a family like I have." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{month before}} Don 2s release Nariman Films, {{producers}} of Don, sent a legal notice to Reliance and Excel Entertainment about the sequel. According to the notice, Nariman {{had given the}} rights to Excel Entertainment in perpetuity for Don alone. The producers replied, [...] "Whatever we have done is legal, so the claim is false {{and so are the}} charges. This is an absolutely new film and there is no question of a delay in releasing Don 2." [...] Khan added in an interview with Mumbai Mirror, [...] "While my producers are best qualified to give a fitting reply to the whole matter, I as a lead actor can say that as for the sequel, the Amitabh Bachchan Don never had a sequel. So where is the question of us copying anything. Farhan and his team have worked on the script, I <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> we haven't copied from anywhere and this is an original script." [...] On 19 December, a week before Don 2s release, the Bombay High Court refused to stay the film's release. The court's ruling considered the film's scheduled release on 21 December overseas and 23 December in India, for which many theatres had been booked.|$|E
2500|$|Inman {{played the}} camp Mr. Wilberforce Claybourne Humphries and his earlier {{career in the}} clothes retail {{business}} was good preparation for this role in a menswear department. Inman developed a characteristic limp-wristed mincing walk, and a high-pitched catchphrase, [...] "I'm free!", which soon entered popular culture. Inman reported that four or {{five members of the}} group Campaign for Homosexual Equality picketed one of his shows in protest as they believed his persona did not help their cause. Inman said that [...] "they thought I was over exaggerating the gay character. But I don't think I do. In fact there are people far more camp than Mr. Humphries walking around this country. Anyway, I <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> an enormous number of viewers like Mr. Humphries and don't really care whether he's camp or not. So far from doing harm to the homosexual image, I feel I might be doing some good". Both Inman and David Croft stated that the character was [...] "just a mother's boy", and that his sexual orientation was never explicitly stated. Inman continued to play in live shows after his success as Mr. Humphries, and began to incorporate camp mannerisms to those performances too, once saying [...] "Even when I'm not playing Mr Humphries, say at a summer season, I camp it up a bit. If I don't the audience are disappointed".|$|E
