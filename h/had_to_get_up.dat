At the 2000 World Championships in Nice, France, a pair skater who had been injured in a lift accident lay on the ice for several minutes and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and leave the ice on his own before being offered medical attention.|$|E
25|$|Ron Lieberman {{returned}} to the couple's apartment after midnight that night and noticed Philip was not there. He believed she had stayed out late or all night, {{as she had been}} doing, and resolved to remind her the next time he saw her to call him under those circumstances. He went to bed as he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> early the next morning for work.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after leaving}} Beamont Secondary Technical School, Clark {{attended}} the Regional College of Art in Manchester at aged 16. Ossie <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> {{very early in}} the morning to make the long trip from home to college each day. Anne Clark would give Ossie prescribed pills to keep him awake and alert. This would be the start of a lifelong addiction to both prescribed and illegal drugs.|$|E

O takes the folder from his case and goes to open it, but there are “two eyelets, well proportioned”; he turns the folder through 90° but he’s disturbed by the parrot’s eye and <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and cover the cage with his coat.

25|$|Before filming started, some of {{the actors}} had to undergo various {{training}} exercises for their roles. Dillahunt, Lindhome, and Aaron Paul—the latter portrays Francis—had {{to take part in}} gun training, while Sara Paxton <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> each morning for swimming lessons so that she looked like an experienced swimmer. Iliadis also spent several weeks with the actors in rehearsal. It was Iliadis's hope that space to rehearse their roles, and then time during filming to develop their characters individually, would help them to trust Iliadis as the director more.|$|E

The only day I really saw him was Sunday...I always wanted to be with him more." ...|$|E
2500|$|Herbert Appel – a stock {{boy at the}} {{hardware}} store, his character is distinguished by his odd speech patterns. By putting non-standard emphasis on syllables and sounds, his sentences can be confusing and/or humorous (what would now be considered mondegreen). For example, [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> at eight o'clock" [...] is heard by Fibber and Molly as [...] "I {{had to get a}} potato clock", [...] "I got up too early" [...] comes out as [...] "I got up twirly", and his own name sounds like [...] "Herber Tapple" [...] (in [...] "Fibber Puts Up Christmas Lights", 12/20/49).|$|E

2500|$|... “After I {{had learned}} to play a little, I was chosen to give all the bugle calls. [...] I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> {{in the morning before}} the others and arouse {{everybody}} by blowing the morning call. [...] Evenings at ten minutes before nine o’clock I blew again. [...] Then all of the boys would run for their rooms. [...] At nine o’clock the second call was given, when all lights were tuned out and {{we were supposed to be}} in bed. [...] Later on I learned the mess call, and eventually could blow all the calls of the regular army.” The Carlisle Indian band of brass instruments performed at football games, world expositions and presidential inaugural parades.

6000|$|... "I rather think not, Peacocke. I rather think not. You'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> earlier {{before you}} {{get the better of}} Robert Lefroy. You don't expect <b>to</b> <b>get</b> this money back again,--do you?" ...|$|R
