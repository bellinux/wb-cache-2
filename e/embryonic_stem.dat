Romney attributed his conversion to an interaction with Harvard University biologist Douglas Melton, an expert on <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> cell biology, although Melton vehemently disputed Romney's recollection of their conversation. Romney subsequently vetoed a bill on pro-life grounds that expanded access to emergency contraception in hospitals and pharmacies (the legislature overrode the veto). He also amended his position on <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> cell research itself.|$|E

5|$|Huntington's disease, {{particularly}} {{the application of}} the genetic test for the disease, has raised several ethical issues. The issues for genetic testing include defining how mature an individual should be before being considered eligible for testing, ensuring the confidentiality of results, and whether companies should be allowed to use test results for decisions on employment, life insurance or other financial matters. There was controversy when Charles Davenport proposed in 1910 that compulsory sterilization and immigration control be used for people with certain diseases, including HD, as part of the eugenics movement. In vitro fertilization has some issues regarding its use of embryos. Some HD research has ethical issues due to its use of animal testing and <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> cells.|$|E

At different times he voted to ban flag-burning and partial-birth abortions, though he reversed his positions on both issues. On education, he expressed support for the public education system, universal pre-kindergarten, and full funding for the No Child Left Behind program. Moran was given a 100% rating by the NARAL and 0% by the National Right to Life Committee, indicating a pro-choice voting record.

5|$|Turning Urine Samples into Brain Cells: This new {{technique}} of reprogramming ordinary cells present in urine into immature brain cells that can form multiple types of functioning neurons and glial cells {{was developed by}} Chinese researchers in China, and {{was published in the}} scientific journal Nature Methods in December 2012. Instead of using retrovirus, they used vectors which the researchers say is a breakthrough This does not involve <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> cells which come with serious drawbacks when transplanted, such as the risk of developing tumours. This technique makes the procedure of generating Induced pluripotent stem cells far easier and non-invasive, as the cells can be obtained from a urine sample instead of a blood sample or biopsy. This research proves human excreta could be a powerful source of cells to study disease, bypassing some of the problems of using stem cells, and could be useful for research studying the cellular mechanisms of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and for testing the effects of new drugs that are being developed to treat them.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of insulin at the University of Toronto in 1921 is {{considered among the}} most significant events {{in the history of}} medicine. The stem cell was discovered at the university in 1963, forming the basis for bone marrow transplantation and all subsequent research on adult and <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> cells. This was the first of many findings at Toronto relating to stem cells, including the identification of pancreatic and retinal stem cells. The cancer stem cell was first identified in 1997 by Toronto researchers, who have since found stem cell associations in leukemia, brain tumors and colorectal cancer. Medical inventions developed at Toronto include the glycaemic index, the infant cereal Pablum, the use of protective hypothermia in open heart surgery and the first artificial cardiac pacemaker. The first successful single-lung transplant was performed at Toronto in 1981, followed by the first nerve transplant in 1988, and the first double-lung transplant in 1989. Researchers identified the maturation promoting factor that regulates cell division, and discovered the T cell receptor, which triggers responses of the immune system. The university is credited with isolating the genes that cause Fanconi anemia, cystic fibrosis and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, among numerous other diseases. Between 1914 and 1972, the university operated the Connaught Medical Research Laboratories, now part of the pharmaceutical corporation Sanofi-Aventis. Among the research conducted at the laboratory was the development of gel electrophoresis.|$|E

50|$|Bivalent {{chromatin}} are {{segments of}} DNA, bound to histone proteins, that have both repressing and activating epigenetic regulators {{in the same}} region. These regulators work to enhance or silence the expression of genes. Since these regulators work in opposition to each other, they normally interact with chromatin at different times. However, in bivalent chromatin, both types of regulators are interacting with the same domain at the same time. Bivalent chromatin domains are normally associated with promoters of transcription factor genes that are expressed at low levels.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Signals between {{stem cells}} and stroma are {{important}} in establishing the stem cell niche. However, very {{little is known about}} the regulation of any mammalian stem cell niche as pure isolates of stem cells and their adjacent mesenchyme are not readily available. The prostate offers a unique model to study signals between stem cells and their adjacent stroma as in the <b>embryonic</b> prostate <b>stem</b> cell niche, the urogenital sinus mesenchyme is easily separated from the epithelial stem cells. Here we investigate the distinctive molecular signals of these two stem cell compartments in a mammalian system. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We isolated fetal murine urogenital sinus epithelium and urogenital sinus mesenchyme and determined their differentially expressed genes. To distinguish transcripts that are shared by other developing epithelial/mesenchymal compartments from those that pertain to the prostate stem cell niche, we also determined the global gene expression of epidermis and dermis of the same embryos. Our analysis indicates that several of the key transcriptional components that are predicted to be active in the <b>embryonic</b> prostate <b>stem</b> cell niche regulate processes such as self-renewal (e. g., E 2 f and Ap 2), lipid metabolism (e. g., Srebp 1) and cell migration (e. g., Areb 6 and Rreb 1). Several of the enriched promoter binding motifs are shared between the prostate epithelial/mesenchymal compartments and their epidermis/dermis counterparts, indicating their likely relevance in epithelial/mesenchymal signaling in primitive cellular compartments. Based on differential gene expression we also defined ligand-receptor interactions that may be part of the molecular interplay of the <b>embryonic</b> prostate <b>stem</b> cell niche. Conclusions/Significance We provide a comprehensive description of the transcriptional program of the major regulators that are likely to control the cellular interactions in the <b>embryonic</b> prostatic <b>stem</b> cell niche, many of which may be common to mammalian niches in general. This study provides a comprehensive source for further studies of mesenchymal/epithelial interactions in the prostate stem cell niche. The elucidation of pathways in the normal primitive niche may provide greater insight into mechanisms subverted during abnormal proliferative and oncogenic processes. Understanding these events may result in the development of specific targeted therapies for prostatic diseases such as benign prostatic hypertrophy and carcinomas...|$|R
