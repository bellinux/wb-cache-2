50|$|The Antarctic {{fur seal}} (Arctocephalus gazella) {{is one of}} eight seals in the genus Arctocephalus, and one of nine fur seals in the {{subfamily}} Arctocephalinae. As its name suggests, the Antarctic fur seal is distributed in Antarctic waters. Around 95% of the world population breeds at the Island of South Georgia. It is named after the German naval vessel, the corvette SMS Gazelle, which collected the first specimen from Kerguelen Island. The species {{is also known as}} the <b>Kerguelen</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal.</b>|$|E

40|$|Australian <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) breed on Bass Strait {{islands in}} Victoria and Tasmania. They have been {{recorded}} in South Australia (SA) for many years as non-breeding visitors and on Kangaroo Island frequently since 1988, mostly in breeding colonies of the New Zealand <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> (A. forsteri) {{which is the most}} numerous pinniped in SA. Australian <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> have displaced New Zealand <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> from sections of the Cape Gantheaume colony on Kangaroo Island. North Casuarina Island produced 29 Australian <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> pups in February 2008. Australian <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> pups were larger than New Zealand <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> pups in the same colony and have been identified genetically using a 263 -bp fragment of the mitochondrial DNA control region. North Casuarina Island has been an important breeding colony of New Zealand <b>fur</b> <b>seals,</b> but pup numbers there decreased since 1992 – 93 (contrary to trends in SA for New Zealand <b>fur</b> <b>seals),</b> while numbers of Australian <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> there have increased. This study confirms that Australian <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> breed in SA. The two <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> species compete for space onshore at several sites. Australian <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> may compete for food with endangered Australian sea lions (Neophoca cinerea) because both are bottom feeders. Peter D. Shaughnessy, Jane McKenzie, Melanie L.

5000|$|Arctocephalus forsteri, the Australasian <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> South Australian <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> New Zealand <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> Antipodean <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> or long-nosed <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> is {{a species}} of <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> found around the south coast of Australia, {{the coast of the}} South Island of New Zealand, and some of the small islands to the south and east of there. While male-only colonies were also located on the Cook Strait coast of the North Island near Wellington [...] there are also {{breeding}} colonies in the North Island. A large accessible breeding colony is located at Cape Palliser, on the south-easternmost tip of the North Island and vagrants are found as far north as New Caledonia. The name New Zealand <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> is used by English speakers in New Zealand (kekeno is used in the Māori language), and southern <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> by speakers in Australia. As of 2014, the common name long-nosed <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> has been proposed for the population of seals inhabiting Australia. [...] Although the Australian and New Zealand populations show some genetic differences, their morphologies are very similar, and thus they remain classed as a single species.|$|R
40|$|Modelling <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> populations {{requires}} the accurate assessment of demographic parameters such as age-specific mortality. Owing to the highly variable mortality rates that pups are subject to, mortality {{of this age}} class {{is perhaps the most}} important factor determining the number of surviving individuals within each cohort. Early pup mortality,sex ratio and median pupping date were determined for sympatric populations of Subantarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> (Arctocephalus tropicalis) and Antarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> (A. gazella) at Marion Island, Southern Ocean. Mortality for this species was density dependent, varying from 0. 8 % at low density sites to 10. 9 % at high density sites. More accurate methods employed at low-density sites showed a substantially higher pup mortality at three weeks of 1. 3 - 3. 4 % for Subantarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seals.</b> The same method yielded a mortality estimate at four weeks of age of 1. 1 - 5. 1 % for Antarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seals.</b> Despite the underestimate inherent in island-wide counts for Subantarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seals,</b> these estimates are still useful for observing temporal and spatial patterns. Sex ratios were at parity for newborns of both species. The sex ratio of eightweek-old Subantarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> pups was also at parity, which is unusual for <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> populations. The median pupping dates determined for Subantarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> and Antarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> did not differ substantially from previous estimates...|$|R
40|$|Two <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> species breed on the {{southern}} coast of Australia: the Australian <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) and the New Zealand <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> (A. forsteri). Two other species are vagrants: the subantarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> (A. tropicalis) and the Antarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> (A. gazella). We document records of vagrant <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> in South Australia from 1982 to 2012 based primarily on records from the South Australian Museum. There were 86 subantarctic fur seals: 49 specimens and 37 sightings. Most (77 %) were recorded from July to October and 83 % of all records were juveniles. All but two specimens were collected between July and November. Sightings were prevalent during the same period, {{but there were also}} nine sightings during summer (December–February), several of healthy-looking adults. Notable concentrations were near Victor Harbor, on Kangaroo Island and Eyre Peninsula. Likely sources of subantarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> seen in South Australia are Macquarie and Amsterdam Islands in the South Indian Ocean, ~ 2700 km south-east and 5200 km west of SA, respectively. There were two sightings of Antarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seals,</b> both of adults, on Kangaroo Island at New Zealand <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> breeding colonies.

50|$|Many <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> {{species were}} heavily {{exploited}} by commercial sealers, {{especially during the}} 19th century when their fur was highly valued. Beginning in the 1790s, the ports of Stonington and New Haven, Connecticut, were leaders of the American <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> trade, which primarily entailed clubbing <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> to death on uninhabited South Pacific islands, skinning them, and selling the hides in China. Many populations, notably the Guadalupe <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> northern <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> and Cape <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> suffered dramatic declines and are still recovering. Currently, most species are protected and hunting is mostly limited to subsistence harvest. Globally, most populations can be considered healthy, mostly because they often prefer remote habitats that are relatively inaccessible to humans. Nonetheless, environmental degradation, competition with fisheries, and climate change potentially pose threats to some populations.|$|R
50|$|The {{sea otter}} and <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> populations {{declined}} {{rapidly in the}} latter half of the 19th century due to over-harvesting, with about 100,000 sea otters and a correspondingly high number of <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> being taken each year. By 1911 only about 2000 sea otters remained in 13 small remnant populations, making hunting unprofitable. Commercial taking of sea otters and <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> were prohibited by the <b>Fur</b> <b>Seal</b> Treaty. The Aleuts were permitted to hunt them for subsistence purposes only.|$|R
50|$|Together {{with the}} <b>fur</b> <b>seals,</b> they {{constitute}} the family Otariidae, collectively known as eared seals. Until recently, sea lions were grouped {{under a single}} subfamily called Otariinae, whereas <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> were grouped in the subfamily Arcocephalinae. This division {{was based on the}} most prominent common feature shared by the <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> and absent in the sea lions, namely the dense underfur characteristic of the former. Recent genetic evidence, however, strongly suggests Callorhinus, the genus of the northern <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> is more closely related to some sea lion species than to the other <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> genus, Arctocephalus. Therefore, the fur seal/sea lion subfamily distinction has been eliminated from many taxonomies.|$|R

40|$|There are ten {{species of}} seals {{recorded}} in Australian waters.

These are the Australian <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) and New Zealand <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> (Arctocephalus forsteri). There are no known breeding colonies of either species in the EMR but there are historical records of Australian <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> breeding at Seal Rocks, near Port Stephens and Montague Island in southern New South Wales (NSW). At present Montague Island is the major haul-out site along the coast of NSW for both species (Shaughnessy 1999).

Foraging effort was hypothesised to be greater in Antarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> than in Subantarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> due to their shorter lactation period. Using satellite telemetry, time-depth recorders and satellite images of sea-surface temperature and chlorophyll a concentration, the foraging grounds, the at-sea activity budgets and the environmental features were determined for both species breeding on the Crozet Archipelago.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the degree to which}} the behavior of a predator in the marine environment can be used to indicate the availability of prey. It examined this in Antarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> (Arctocephalus gazella) feeding on krill, with a view to understanding how behavioral choices could lead to a nonlinear functional response. The study showed how <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> adjusted their time budgets to maximize the mean rate of energy intake in response to varying prey abundance. The behavioral indicator of prey abundance was the amount of time spent by <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> at the bottom of dives after adjustment for dive depth. This indicator was well correlated with independent measures of prey abundance. The indicator was calibrated in terms of net rate of energy intake from information about energy expenditures in Antarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> and was used within the framework of optimal foraging theory to examine how female <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> organized their foraging activity within and between bouts. Foraging in Antarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> conformed to many of the predictions from energy rate-maximizing behavior. For example, the apparent net rate of energy intake by <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> declined with time spent in a patch, and the rate of energy intake on leaving a patch declined as apparent food availability in the environment declined. In addition, the time spent in patches increased as apparent food availability declined. Antarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> were able to adjust their behavior to track highly variable prey distributions and densities. The simple decision about when to leave a patch in relation to current environmental prey availability appears to be responsible for allowing <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> to maintain saturation of the foraging rate as food density declines...|$|R
40|$|A recent rapid {{increase}} in the number of Antarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> on Signy Island has caused extensive changes to terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems.

Seal hairs in lake sediments from Sombre Lake were assessed as indicators of visiting <b>fur</b> <b>seals.</b> Results showed that sediments could be used to detect the presence, absence and possibly broad scale changes in the abundance of <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> and indicated that <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> have visited the island from the beginning of the sedimentary record (6570 ± 60 14 C years B.

50|$|Sea lions {{are related}} to the walrus and the <b>seal.</b> Nonetheless, all <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> have certain {{features}} in common: the fur, generally smaller sizes, farther and longer foraging trips, smaller and more abundant prey items, and greater sexual dimorphism. All sea lions have certain features in common, in particular their coarse, short fur, greater bulk, and larger prey than <b>fur</b> <b>seals.</b> For these reasons, the distinction remains useful. The family Otariidae (Order Carnivora) contains the 14 extant species of <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> and sea lions. Traditional classification of the family into the subfamilies Arctocephalinae (<b>fur</b> <b>seals)</b> and Otariinae (sea lions) is not supported, with the <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> Callorhinus ursinus having a basal relationship relative {{to the rest of the}} family. This is consistent with the fossil record which suggests that this genus diverged from the line leading to the remaining <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> and sea lions about 6 million years ago (mya). Similar genetic divergences between the sea lion clades as well as between the major Arctocephalus <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> clades, suggest that these groups underwent periods of rapid radiation at about the time they diverged from each other. The phylogenetic relationships within the family and the genetic distances among some taxa highlight inconsistencies in the current taxonomic classification of the family.|$|R
50|$|Typically, <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> gather {{during the}} summer in large assemblages at {{specific}} beaches or rocky outcrops to give birth and breed. All species are polygynous, meaning dominant males reproduce {{with more than one}} female. For most species, total gestation lasts about 11.5 months, including a several-month period of delayed implantation of the embryo. While northern <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> males aggressively select and defend the specific females in their harems, males of southern species of <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> tend to protect spatial territories, and females are free to choose or switch their mates according to their own preferences or social hierarchy. After several continuous days of nursing the newborn pups, females go on extended foraging trips that can last as long as a week, returning to the rookery to feed their pups until they are weaned. Males fast during the reproductive season, unwilling to leave their females or territories. The remainder of the year, <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> lead a largely pelagic existence in the open sea, pursuing their prey wherever it is abundant. <b>Fur</b> <b>seals</b> feed on moderately sized fish, squid, and krill. Several species of the southern <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> also have sea birds, especially penguins, as part of their diets. The <b>fur</b> <b>seals,</b> in turn, are preyed upon by sharks, killer whales, and occasionally by larger sea lions.|$|R
50|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} {{the discovery of the}} islands, during the Maritime Fur Trade era, the islands were exploited by seal hunters, first from New England and later from Russia. The Russians maintained a sealing station in the Farallones from 1812 to 1840, taking 1,200 to 1,500 <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> annually, though American ships had already exploited the islands. The Albatross, captained by Nathan Winship, and the O'Cain, captained by his brother Jonathan Winship, were the first American ships sent from Boston in 1809 to establish a settlement on the Columbia River. In 1810, they met up with two other American ships at the Farallon Islands, the Mercury and the Isabella, and at least 30,000 seal skins were taken. By 1818 the seals diminished rapidly until only about 500 could be taken annually and within the next few years, the <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> was extirpated from the islands. It is not known whether the northern <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> or the Guadalupe <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> were the islands' native <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> although the northern <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> is the species that began to recolonize the islands in 1996.|$|R

40|$|The Antarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> (Arctocephalus gazella) {{population}} at South Georgia {{has increased dramatically}} through the 20 th and 21 st centuries following near extinction {{at the beginning of}} the 20 th century. This rapid increase is now causing concern as the seals are damaging the coastal habitats of South Georgia including specially protected areas. To assess whether this population increase is part of a natural fluctuation or due to human induced changes in the marine ecosystem, the <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> population has been reconstructed through the Holocene from seal hair abundance and geochemistry. Results from the <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> hair abundance record show <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> have been present at South Georgia for at least the past 3439 14 C yrs BP and the population today is not unprecedented during the late Holocene. Although previous studies have found a correlation between <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> populations and geochemistry, this study highlights that this is not effective at all study sites due to the complex relationship between climate change, catchment sediment delivery processes and seal population dynamics. At South Georgia, Cu and Zn are found to be indicators of <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> activity once a threshold of 1500 hairs per 1 g of dry weight is reached. The <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> hair abundance results suggest there is a link between <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> populations and climate change. Although the largest increases in for seal population occur during cooler periods, the <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> population is primarily controlled by prey availability (Euphausia superba), which is in turn influenced by climate change. Pre 200 yrs BP, an increase in prey availability is associated with colder periods, which are linked to changes in oceanography and led to a consequent increase in sea-ice extent. Post 200 yrs BP, the whaling industry has resulted in a krill surplus in the South Georgia region elevating krill availability, causing an increase in the <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> population (that has been coincident with warming). Although the population has increased during the 20 th and 21 st century as a result of human induced causes, this increase cannot be sustained once the krill sumlus ceases, As the population has been at similar levels previously and the krill surplus is thought to be ending, it is concluded that the <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> population increase during the 20 th century is not abnormal and management of the <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> {{population at}} South Georgia may not be necessary...|$|R
