40|$|Using a {{large sample}} of {{developing}} and industrialized economies during 1970 - 1999, this paper explores whether {{the choice of}} exchange rate regime affects the sensitivity of local interest <b>rates</b> to <b>international</b> interest <b>rates.</b> In most cases, we cannot reject full transmission of <b>international</b> interest <b>rates</b> in the long run, even for countries with floating regimes. Only a couple of large industrial countries can choose their own interest rates in the long run. However, short-run effects differ across regimes. Dynamic estimates show that interest rates of countries with more flexible regimes adjust more slowly to changes in <b>international</b> <b>rates,</b> implying some capacity for monetary independence...|$|R

40|$|We {{find that}} {{in a sample of}} {{emerging}} economies business cycles are more volatile than in developed ones, real interest rates are countercyclical and lead the cycle, consumption is more volatile than output and net exports are strongly countercyclical. We present a model of a small open economy, where the real interest rate is decomposed in an <b>international</b> <b>rate</b> and a country risk component. Country risk is a. ected by fundamental shocks but, through the presence of working capital, also amplifies the e. ects of those shocks. The model generates business cycles consistent with Argentine data. Eliminating country risk lowers Argentine output volatility by 27 % while stabilizing <b>international</b> <b>rates</b> lowers it by less than 3 %. ...|$|R
40|$|Motivated by the Chinese experience, we analyze a semi-open economy {{where the}} central bank has access to {{international}} capital markets, but the private sector has not. This enables {{the central bank}} to choose an interest rate different from the <b>international</b> <b>rate.</b> We examine the optimal policy of the central bank by modelling it as a Ramsey planner who can choose the level of domestic public debt and of international reserves. The central bank can improve savings opportunities of credit-constrained consumers modelled as in Woodford (1990). We find that in a steady state it is optimal for the central bank to replicate the open economy, i. e., to issue debt financed by the accumulation of reserves so that the domestic interest rate equals the foreign rate. When {{the economy is in}} transition, however, a rapidly growing economy has a higher welfare without capital mobility and the optimal interest rate differs from the <b>international</b> <b>rate.</b> We argue that the domestic interest rate should be temporarily above the <b>international</b> <b>rate.</b> We also find that capital controls can still help reach the first best when the planner has more fiscal instruments...|$|R
