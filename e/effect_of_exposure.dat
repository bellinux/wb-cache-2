25|$|In 1951, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was {{planning}} on stopping funding for the ABCC's work in Japan. However, James V. Neel made an appeal and the AEC decided to fund them $20,000 a year, for three years, to continue research. In 1956, Neel and William J. Schull published their final draft of The <b>Effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>Exposure</b> to the Atomic Bombs on Pregnancy Termination in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This monograph gave {{a detailed description of}} all the data they had collected Despite their efforts, trust in the ABCC was declining, so the ABCC became the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF), and with the new name and administrative organization, funding for the research on survivors was to be provided equally by the United States and Japan. The RERF was established on 1 April 1975. A binational organization run by both the United States and Japan, the RERF is still in operation today.|$|E
500|$|Social science {{research}} gives {{weight to the}} perceptions of those directly affected. In particular, studies {{support the view that}} sports mascots and images are not trivial. Stereotyping directly affects academic performance and self-esteem, which contribute to all of the other issues faced by Native Americans, including suicide, unemployment, and poverty. European Americans exposed to mascots are more likely to believe not only that stereotypes are true, but that Native Americans have no identity beyond these stereotypes. Two studies examining the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to an American Indian sports mascot found a tendency to endorse stereotypes of a different minority group (Asian Americans), which is indicative of a [...] "spreading effect". Exposure to any stereotypes increased the likelihood of stereotypical thinking; demonstrating the harm done to society by stereotyping of any kind. A connection between stereotyping and racism of any group increasing the likelihood of stereotyping others was made by Native Americans opposing the [...] "Indians" [...] mascot in Skowhegan, Maine when fliers promoting the KKK were distributed in that town.|$|E
40|$|The <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to {{ionizing}} radiation on behavior {{may result from}} effects on peripheral or on central systems. For behavioral endpoints that are mediated by peripheral systems (e. g., radiation-induced conditioned taste aversion or vomiting), the behavioral <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to heavy particles (56 Fe, 600 MeV/n) are qualitatively similar to the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to gamma radiation (60 Co) and to fission spectrum neutrons. For these endpoints, the only differences between {{the different types of}} radiation are in terms of relative behavioral effectiveness. For behavioral endpoints that are mediated by central systems (e. g., amphetamine-induced taste aversion learning), the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to 56 Fe particles are not seen following exposure to lower LET gamma rays or fission spectrum neutrons. These results indicate that the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to heavy particles on behavioral endpoints cannot necessarily be extrapolated from studies using gamma rays, but require the use of heavy particles...|$|R

2500|$|Research also {{demonstrates}} the harm done to society by stereotyping of any kind. Two studies examined the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to an American Indian sports mascot on {{the tendency to}} endorse stereotypes of a different minority group. A study was first done at the University of Illinois, and then replicated at The College of New Jersey with the same results. Students were given a paragraph to read about Chief Illiniwek adapted from the University of Illinois' official website; while the control group was given a description of an arts center. In both studies the students exposed to the sports mascot {{were more likely to}} express stereotypical views of Asian-Americans. Although Chief Illiniwek was described only in terms of positive characteristics (as a respectful symbol, not a mascot), the stereotyping of Asian-Americans included negative characteristics, such as being [...] "socially inept". This was indicative of a spreading effect; exposure to any stereotypes increased the likelihood of stereotypical thinking.|$|E

The term is also applicable to the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to contexts in which gang violence and crime are endemic {{as well as to the}} <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> ongoing <b>exposure</b> to life threats in high-risk occupations such as police, fire and emergency services.|$|R

2500|$|Confounding has {{traditionally}} been defined as bias arising from the co-occurrence or mixing of effects of extraneous factors, referred to as confounders, with the main effect(s) of interest. A more recent definition of confounding invokes the notion of counterfactual effects. According to this view, when one observes an outcome of interest, say Y=1 (as opposed to Y=0), in a given population A which is entirely exposed (i.e. exposure X=1 for every unit of the population) the risk of this event will be RA1. The counterfactual or unobserved risk RA0 corresponds to the risk {{which would have been}} observed if these same individuals had been unexposed (i.e. X=0 for every unit of the population). The true <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> therefore is: RA1−RA0 (if one is interested in risk differences) or RA1/RA0 (if one is interested in relative risk). Since the counterfactual risk RA0 is unobservable we approximate it using a second population B and we actually measure the following relations: RA1−RB0 or RA1/RB0. In this situation, confounding occurs when RA0≠RB0. (NB: Example assumes binary outcome and exposure variables.) ...|$|E
2500|$|These {{findings}} were radical {{at the time}} and continue to be debated. In 2002, the anthropologists CoreyS.Sparks and RichardL.Jantz claimed that differences between children born to the same parents in Europe and America were very small and insignificant, {{and that there was no}} detectable <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to the American environment on the cranial index in children. They argued that their results contradicted Boas's original findings and demonstrated that they may no longer be used to support arguments of plasticity in cranial morphology. However, Jonathan Marks—a well-known physical anthropologist and former president of the General Anthropology section of the American Anthropological Association—has remarked that this revisionist study of Boas's work [...] "has the ring of desperation to it (if not obfuscation), and has been quickly rebutted by more mainstream biological anthropology". In 2003 anthropologists Clarence C. Gravlee, H. Russell Bernard, and William R. Leonard reanalyzed Boas's data and concluded that most of Boas's original {{findings were}} correct. Moreover, they applied new statistical, computer-assisted methods to Boas's data and discovered more evidence for cranial plasticity. In a later publication, Gravlee, Bernard and Leonard reviewed Sparks and Jantz's analysis. They argue that Sparks and Jantz misrepresented Boas's claims, and that Sparks's and Jantz's data actually support Boas. For example, they point out that Sparks and Jantz look at changes in cranial size in relation to how long an individual has been in the United States in order to test the influence of the environment. Boas, however, looked at changes in cranial size in relation to how long the mother had been in the United States. They argue that Boas's method is more useful, because the prenatal environment is a crucial developmental factor.|$|E

But there was no outbreak between them and Harold.

Alice wanted nothing but {{to look at her}} son--"her beautiful boy," [...] "her Harry come back to her at last;" [...] and kind and tender to her and loving, as he had never been since his baby days; but he would have moved heaven and earth to obtain comforts and attendance for her.
