However, a statistically significant variation (P ≤  0.01) among the treatments was observed only for Exchangeable Ca and Mg and not for Na and K (Table  7). The highest values for all the <b>exchangeable</b> <b>bases</b> were recorded for those plots treated with vermicompost at a rate of 15 ton ha− 1 (T 8), while plots that did not receive vermicompost at any rate have shown the lowest value. Both exchangeable Ca and Mg responded significantly to the added vermicompost when the vermicompost was applied at a rate of ≥ 7.5 ton ha− 1.

40|$|Compared to conifers, {{broadleaf}} {{forests are}} {{less prone to}} soil and water acidification, because (1) they often have soils with larger <b>exchangeable</b> <b>base</b> cation pools, (2) the pollution scavenging capacity of deciduous trees is lower, and (3) they grow more slowly and are often less intensively managed. Since the 1980 s, atmospheric deposition acidity has strongly decreased in forest ecosystems, so that the present acidification status of broadleaf forests should be improving. We used a 35 year-old beech plot in the Morvan Mountains (Burgundy, France) to question past and present acidification processes in broadleaf ecosystems. Soil exchangeable Mg, Ca and K pools measured from samples collected in 1974 and 2001 were compared and input-output budgets were computed over the 2003 - 2008 period. The objectives were (i) to assess Mg and Ca pool size changes over 1974 - 2008, (ii) to discuss the potential causes of these changes and, (iii) discuss the limits of conventional methods to study nutrient pool size changes (soil data comparison and nutrient budgets). Soil exchangeable Mg pools decreased during the 1974 - 2001 period while Ca and K pools remained constant, and very small. Soil solution monitoring and input-output budgets over the 2003 - 2008 period suggested an ongoing loss of exchangeable Ca and Mg, {{partly due to the}} desorption of sulphate from the soil which induced Mg, Ca and K depletion. Given the very low concentration in <b>exchangeable</b> <b>base</b> cations, and assuming no change in soil spatial variability, we computed that resampling soils at 10 years intervals may not unequivocally demonstrate a gain/loss of <b>exchangeable</b> <b>base</b> cations. Foliar Mg concentrations were continuously below the deficiency level, K and N concentrations decreased but Ca did not. From this, we discuss the validity/limits of the different approaches used, how the ecosystem can cope with such low levels of nutrients, and the fluxes and processes within the ecosystem that should be investigated in this perspective.

The objective of this research was to investigate those rates and mechanisms for a slightly calcareous soil. The field data were based on selected treatments from a long-term (1991 – 2015) N fertilization experiment at a rice-wheat rotation on a slightly calcareous (pH 7. 7), young and hardly weathered clay soil (Regosol), including two plots with urea and NH 4 Cl fertilization and a control plot (no N fertilization). Urea and NH 4 Cl were applied at annual rates of 300 kg (1991 – 1996) and 285 kg (1997 – 2015) N ha − 1.

40|$|The {{greater part}} of younger halogenetic polder soils in the 6 th and the 7 th section of Kojima Polder consist of heavy clay and have sticky, puddled {{structure}} and are quite impervious to water. It {{was found that the}} younger polder soils contain a large amount of the soluble salts, and of the <b>exchangeable</b> <b>bases,</b> the MgO and Na 2 O are more prominent. As is well known, the abnormal composition of <b>exchangeable</b> <b>bases</b> is considered to be the major factor of the poor physical condition of these polder soils. The experimental work reported in this paper deals with the problem of the effects of iron sulfide which has been formed in polder soils under an. anaerobic condition on the solubility of added calcium carbonate and the composition of <b>exchangeable</b> <b>bases</b> after drainage. Kojima heavy clay soil and Fukuda loamy soil were chosen for the test and calcium carbonate and starch were added to each soil sample. All of the soil samples were preliminarily incubated in water-logged condition for about one year and then incubated at 30 ℃ under the condition of the moisture content of field capacity for several weeks. Changes of pH and soluble salts by reduction and oxidation of samples were determined. (Table 1) The comparison of <b>exchangeable</b> <b>bases</b> between original. soils and incubated samples was made. (Table 2 & 3) The incubated samples were leached by carbonate water for five times. Successive and total losses of CaO, MgO and SO 3 in every leachate were determined. (Table 6 & 7) The comparison of <b>exchangeable</b> <b>bases</b> between incubated samples and leached samples was made. (Table 2 & 3) The results obtained may be summarized as follows: (1) The reaction of water-logged standard samples is alkaline, pH ranging from 7. 2 to 10. 3. After incubation, iron sulfide oxidizes and most of these samples show strong acidities, ranging from pH 4. 3 to 6. 1, and water-soluble sulfates and calcium increased greatly. After leaching, the <b>exchangeable</b> <b>bases</b> are replaced by hydrogen and percentage base saturation is decreased to a maked extent in every soil. (2) The reaction of water-logged samples, to which calcium carbonate was added is more alkaline as compared with standard samples. The pH values of these samples decrease to some degree after incubation but they remain neutral to slightly alkaline, ranging from pH 7. 0 to 8. 0. In the incubated samples, there is a marked increase of water-soluble sulfates and calcium and exchange calcium, but exchange Mg, Na and K are decreased. It appears that during incubation most of the iron sulfide oxidizes; the H 2 SO 4 formed reacts with the CaCO 3 and CaSO 4 is formed; the CaSO 4 rapidly changes the sodium clay into calcium clay. During the leaching process, the solution of CaCO 3 and the exchange of Ca for Na and Mg proceeds to a large extent; consequently a considerable part of exchange Na and Mg are replaced by Ca in the final situation. (3) The {{greater part of}} soluble calcium and magnesium are leached in the first leachate from the standard samples but considerable quantities are leached successively in every leachate from the samples to which CaCO 3 is added.

40|$|The dynamic soil {{acidification}} model SAFE {{was applied to}} 44 forested sites in Skåne, southern Sweden, using available Swedish databases on present soil status, vegetation and deposition. Time series of deposition were derived for each site from present deposition in a generalized fashion by dividing deposition into different classes and scaling with deposition trends from the literature. This study connects {{the current status of}} the soil and the soil development with critical load maps calculated with the steady-state model PROFILE. The model was calibrated against measurements of present base saturation from the Swedish Forest Inventory. Model output was compared with available measurements of soil water chemistry. Model output was used to assess the time delay between changes in acidic input and system response in terms of <b>exchangeable</b> <b>base</b> cations and pH. The model was also used for scenario analysis, applying the reductions agreed in the Oslo Protocol to assess the environmental benefits of the agreement...|$|R
40|$|It is {{of global}} concern to adopt {{measures}} to mitigate land degradation caused by agricultural production systems. One {{of the strategies}} proposed is to replace degraded pastures with agrosilvopastoral systems which integrate three different land-use types: crop production, livestock pasture and forestry plantation (denoted iCLF). However, {{little is known about}} the differences between iCLF and other land use types in terms of soil microbial community structure. Distance matrices based on individual soil chemical properties and individual soil microbial variables were correlated by Procrustes analysis and these re-lationships yielded vectors of residuals depicting these correlations (matches). These vectors were used as univariate response variables in an ANOVA framework in order to investigate how the match sizes (the strength of correlation/covariance) between individual soil chemical properties and individual soil mi-crobial variables vary across land use types (levels: iCLF; degradated pasture; improved pasture; and a native cerrado fragment) and also across sample origin within iCLF (levels: soil samples under morein fluence of the exotic tree forest stand; soil samples under influence of the pasture; samples within the transition between the forest stand and the pasture). We were able to obtain insights into the fact that the land use distinction can be driven by more than just individual soil chemical and microbial variables. The integration of crop, livestock and forestry promoted a dominance of fungi in this low fertility and low pH environment. P availability and the composite variable <b>exchangeable</b> <b>base</b> cations (Caþ 2, Mgþ 2, Kþ) were the soil properties whose strengths of correlation (match sizes) with individual microbial variables were the most affected by land use type and sampling origin within iCLF. While the strength of the correlation between soil microbial structure variables and P availability was typically land use type dependent, the response of the microbial structure to <b>exchangeable</b> <b>base</b> cations was mainly affected by the sample origin within iCLF. Finally our results point towards the conclusion that increases in the heterogeneity of vegetation within integrated crop, pasture and forestry systems are an important driver of microbial community response to environmental changes, and may be one means by which to in-crease the sustainability of tropical agroecosystems. 201...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{environmental}} impacts of concentrated animal feeding operations is soil degradation {{in the vicinity of}} the livestock breeding facilities due to substances such as ammonia emitted from the various stages of the process. In this research, the soil degradation effects of an intensive hog farming operation (IHFO) located at a Mediterranean limestone soil coastal area have been investigated. Soil samples of the upper mineral soil were taken in various distances and directions from the IHFO boundaries. Thirteen experimental cycles were carried out in the duration of 1. 5 years starting in March 2009 until October 2010. The soil samples were analysed on total, exchangeable and water-soluble Ca, Mg and K as well as water-soluble ammonium concentrations. Significantly lower concentrations of the <b>exchangeable</b> and water-soluble <b>base</b> cations were observed on soil samples at increasing proximity downwind from the farm (south). Southern soil average concentrations of <b>exchangeable</b> <b>base</b> cations ranged between 78. 6 and 128. 52 mmol Ca 2 + kg- 1 soil, 8. 42 - 21. 39 mmol Mg 2 + kg- 1 soil and 4. 25 - 8. 1 mmol K+ kg- 1 soil, respectively. Southern soil average concentrations of water-soluble base cations ranged between 0. 57 and 2. 17 mmol Ca 2 + kg- 1 soil, 0. 16 - 0. 89 mmol Mg 2 + kg- 1 soil and 0. 48 - 0. 95 mmol K+ kg- 1 soil, respectively. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.
