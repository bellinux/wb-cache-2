40|$|AbstractNel-like protein 1 (NELL- 1) is an osteoinductive {{molecule}} {{associated with}} premature calvarial suture closure. Here we identified apoptosis related protein 3 (APR 3), a membrane protein {{known as a}} proliferation suppressor, as a binding protein of NELL- 1 by biopanning. NELL- 1 and APR 3 colocalized on the nuclear envelope of human osteoblasts. NELL- 1 significantly inhibited proliferation of osteoblasts co-transfected with APR 3 through further down-regulation of Cyclin D 1. The co-expression of NELL- 1 and APR 3 enhanced Ocn and Bsp expression and mineralization. RNAi of APR 3 significantly reduced the differentiation effect of NELL- 1. These {{findings suggest that the}} effects of NELL- 1 on osteoblastic differentiation and proliferation are partly through binding to APR 3.

Such coevolution at the amino acid sequence level is well documented, and {{has been used to}} predict <b>interacting</b> proteins, domains, and amino acids. <b>Interacting</b> proteins are also often precisely coexpressed with one another, presumably to maintain proper stoichiometry among <b>interacting</b> components.

We estimate average expression levels of genes from four closely related fungi of the genus Saccharomyces using the codon adaptation index, and show that expression levels of <b>interacting</b> proteins exhibit coordinated changes in these different species. We find that this coevolution of expression is a more powerful predictor of physical interaction than is coevolution of amino acid sequence. These results demonstrate coevolution of gene expression for the first time, adding a new dimension {{to the study of the}} coevolution of <b>interacting</b> proteins, and underscoring the importance of maintaining coexpression of <b>interacting</b> proteins over evolutionary time.
