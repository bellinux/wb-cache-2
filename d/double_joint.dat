50|$|Action: The <b>double</b> <b>joint</b> {{reduces the}} {{nutcracker}} effect found in single-jointed snaffles. However, the middle link is angled {{relative to the}} side pieces of the bit. As a result, the thin edge of the center link can press into the tongue, creating a very small bearing surface. When a full-cheek Dr. Bristol is used, the bit can be rotated so that the angled middle joint lies flat with its broad side against the tongue; when used this way the bit is relatively mild. This latter method is only possible because bit keepers ensure the bit stays in a fixed position in the horse's mouth, and thus bits that do not use bit keepers (e.g., a D-ring or eggbutt) do not have this milder option.|$|E

In Part 2, an experimental study is conducted regarding how relaxation and creep affects properties of a hybrid joint between carbon fiber vinylester and steel. Failure modes, loss of clamped force and ultimate strength of the joint and how these are affected by elevated temperature and different clamped forces are presented. Test specimens were 184 × 45 × 5 mm CFRP, in double lap joint between two steel plates of same dimensions, with either a single or double M 10 hexagon flange screw. Creep/ relaxation testing was preformed over a 28 day period. Results shows that the amount of initial clamped force does not effect amount of loss of clamped force, but increase in temperature significantly does. Average loss was between 8. 3 an 8. 8 % for single joint specimens, initial torque of 28, 37 and 46 Nm, and 10. 8 % for <b>double</b> <b>joint</b> specimens, 37 Nm. But losses for specimens subjected to heat, 80 °C, was 35. 5 %. Ultimate bearing strength of the lamina was not effected by any circumstances. Slip load was lower for specimens clamped with lower clamped force, the loss over the 28 day period was not enough to produced any clear results regarding the amount of loss. But tendencies point towards a lowered slip load of the same magnitude as the loss of clamped force i. e around 8 - 9 %. Slip load for specimens subjected to 80 °C did not decreased, even though the clamped force had been lowered.

40|$|Welding {{is a major}} 			joining {{technique}} {{employed in}} hi-tech industries like in nuclear, 			aerospace and aeronautical, submarine and shipbuilding and pressure 			vessel applications {{for the production of}} high performing resilient 			structures. The problems of weld induced imperfections like residual 			stresses and shape change behavior evolve almost simultaneously with 			the introduction of welding as a joining method and harmful stresses 			in metals due to welding were reported in 1892 by Slavianov in his 			work. Tremendous efforts were made {{in the last couple of}} decades 			showing remarkable development in new welding technologies for 			defect free resilient structures capable of excellent in-service 			thermal and structural load bearing features. Despite these 			considerable technological innovations in high temperature joining 			technologies, the problems of weld induced imperfections like 			residual stresses and distortions is still a major challenge for the 			welding engineers due to the complex nature of the welding 			phenomenon. 			Thin cylindrical shell structures constitute an important class of 			axis-symmetric structures and are exceptionally utilized in most of 			the high-tech domains. Therefore, the reliability of materials and 			structures in the form of thin-walled cylindrical structures is of 			paramount importance in aerospace, marine, aeronautical structures, 			pressure vessels and nuclear engineering applications. A number of 			longitudinal and circumferential welds are the mandatory integrating 			technique available for hi-tech applications like missile casing, 			nuclear reactors and pressure vessels, where specific strength and 			cost effectiveness are the major design constraints. These welds are 			commonly produced by single or <b>double</b> <b>joint</b> configuration 			penetrations and single or multiple runs arc welding processes. Gas 			Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) and Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) process 			are the obvious selection in this regards due to excellent weld 			joint features. Low alloy steels (may or may not requiring post weld 			strengthening heat treatments depending upon the in-service 			loadings) along with stainless steels are the potential candidate 			materials. 			Transient temperature distributions during Gas Tungsten Arc Welding 			(GTAW) process and subsequent cooling of the weldments have 			significant effect on the microstructures, physical properties, 			residual stress distributions and development of weld solidification 			cracks. The primary driving forces for most of the weld induced 			imperfections are the transient temperature distributions followed 			by transient and residual stress fields. In the present research 			dissertation, transient temperature distributions, 			transient/residual stress fields and distortion patterns for 			circumferentially welded thin-walled cylinders of low carbon steel 			and stainless are investigated in detail. A hybrid numerical 			simulation and experimental based analysis approach is employed. The 			simulations strategy is developed and implemented by using 			commercial available general purpose finite element software ANSYS® 			enhanced with a number of author written subroutines. The moving 			heat sources, material deposition, temperature dependent material 			properties, metal plasticity and elasticity, transient heat transfer 			and mechanical analyses are included. One-way thermo-mechanical 			coupling is assumed i. e. de-coupled thermo-mechanical analysis in 			which the thermal analysis is completed first, followed by a 			separate mechanical analysis based on the thermal history. As part 			of an integrated effort to model and predict GTA welding process, a 			series of single-pass experiments for butt-joint configurations in 			thin-walled cylinders is conducted on robotized tungsten inert gas 			welding equipment. 			This dissertation therefore, presents the development of an 			experimental and numerical approach to the analysis of 			circumferentially arc welded thin-walled cylinders. The 			investigation jointly relies on the finite element analysis and the 			experimentation and shows a good co-relation between the simulation 			and experimental work with close agreement to the previously 			published literature (where applicable and cited) ...|$|E
