5|$|RNAi is an RNA-dependent gene {{silencing}} {{process that is}} controlled by the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and is initiated by short double-stranded RNA molecules in a cell's cytoplasm, where they interact with the catalytic RISC component argonaute. When the dsRNA is exogenous (coming from infection by a virus with an RNA genome or laboratory manipulations), the RNA is imported directly into the cytoplasm and cleaved to short fragments by Dicer. The initiating dsRNA can also be <b>endogenous</b> (originating in the cell), as in pre-microRNAs expressed from RNA-coding genes in the genome. The primary transcripts from such genes are first processed to form the characteristic stem-loop structure of pre-miRNA in the nucleus, then exported to the cytoplasm. Thus, the two dsRNA pathways, exogenous and <b>endogenous,</b> converge at the RISC.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a {{study which}} used <b>endogenous</b> {{retrovirus}} markers {{to investigate the}} history of sheep domestication found the Jacob to be more closely linked to sheep from Africa and South-west Asia than to other British breeds, though all domestic breeds {{can be traced back}} to an origin the Fertile Crescent.|$|E
5|$|Some {{antioxidant}} supplements may promote {{disease and}} increase mortality in humans under certain conditions. Hypothetically, free radicals induce an <b>endogenous</b> response that protects against exogenous radicals (and possibly other toxic compounds). Free radicals may increase life span. This increase may be prevented by antioxidants, providing direct evidence that toxic radicals may mitohormetically exert life extending and health promoting effects.|$|E
5|$|The {{control of}} migration, its timing and {{response}} are genetically controlled {{and appear to}} be a primitive trait that is present even in non-migratory species of birds. The ability to navigate and orient themselves during migration is a much more complex phenomenon that may include both <b>endogenous</b> programs as well as learning.|$|E
25|$|<b>Endogenous</b> {{nitrous oxide}} can {{possibly}} {{play a role}} in modulating <b>endogenous</b> opioid and NMDA systems.|$|E
25|$|The <b>endogenous</b> {{cannabinoid}} system includes cannabinoid receptors, their <b>endogenous</b> ligands (endocannabinoids) and enzymes {{for their}} synthesis and degradation.|$|E
25|$|It {{was shown}} that <b>endogenous</b> sulfur dioxide {{plays a role}} in {{diminishing}} an experimental lung damage caused by oleic acid. <b>Endogenous</b> sulfur dioxide lowered lipid peroxidation, free radical formation, oxidative stress and inflammation during an experimental lung damage. Conversely, a successful lung damage caused a significant lowering of <b>endogenous</b> sulfur dioxide production, and an increase in lipid peroxidation, free radical formation, oxidative stress and inflammation. Moreover, blockade of an enzyme that produces <b>endogenous</b> SO2 significantly increased the amount of lung tissue damage in the experiment. Conversely, adding acetylcysteine or glutathione to the rat diet increased the amount of <b>endogenous</b> SO2 produced and decreased the lung damage, the free radical formation, oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|Addiction {{vulnerability}} <b>Endogenous</b> oxytocin {{can also}} impact on drug effects and susceptibility to develop Substance use disorder. <b>Endogenous</b> oxytocin concentrations can directly impact on drug effects. Additionally, bilateral interactions with numerous systems, including the dopamine system, Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and immune system, can impact on development of dependence. The {{status of the}} <b>endogenous</b> oxytocin system might enhance or reduce susceptibility to addiction through its interaction with these systems. Individual differences in the <b>endogenous</b> oxytocin system based on genetic predisposition, gender and environmental influences, may therefore affect addiction vulnerability. Oxytocin {{may be related to}} the place conditioning behaviors observed in habitual drug abusers.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{most common}} sources of {{neurotoxins}} which are {{acquired by the}} body through ingestion, <b>endogenous</b> neurotoxins both originate from and exert their effects in-vivo. Additionally, though most venoms and exogenous neurotoxins will rarely possess useful in-vivo capabilities, <b>endogenous</b> neurotoxins are commonly used by the body in useful and healthy ways, such as nitric oxide which is used in cell communication. It is often only when these <b>endogenous</b> compounds become highly concentrated that they lead to dangerous effects.|$|E
25|$|Small {{amounts of}} <b>endogenous</b> {{ethylene}} are also produced in mammals, including humans, due to lipid peroxidation. Some of <b>endogenous</b> ethylene is then oxidized to ethylene oxide, which {{is able to}} alkylate DNA and proteins, including hemoglobin (forming a specific adduct with its N-terminal valine, N-hydroxyethyl-valine). <b>Endogenous</b> ethylene oxide, just as like environmental (exogenous) one, can alkylate guanine in DNA, forming an adduct 7-(2-hydroxyethyl)-guanine, and this poses an intrinsic carcinogenic risk. It is also mutagenic.|$|E
25|$|Some {{authors have}} shown that neurons can produce {{hydrogen}} cyanide upon activation of their opioid receptors by <b>endogenous</b> or exogenous opioids. They have also shown that neuronal production of HCN activates NMDA receptors and {{plays a role in}} signal transduction between neuronal cells (neurotransmission). Moreover, increased <b>endogenous</b> neuronal HCN production under opioids was seemingly needed for adequate opioid analgesia, as analgesic action of opioids was attenuated by HCN scavengers. They considered <b>endogenous</b> HCN to be a neuromodulator.|$|E
25|$|Kv12.2 {{channels}} {{were found}} to be inhibited by <b>endogenous</b> KCNE3 (and KCNE1) subunits in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Thus, silencing of <b>endogenous</b> KCNE3 or KCNE1 using siRNA increases the macroscopic current of exogenously expressed Kv12.2. Kv12.2 forms a tripartite complex with KCNE1 and KCNE3 in oocytes, and may do so in mouse brain. Previously, <b>endogenous</b> oocyte KCNE3 and KCNE1 were also found to inhibit exogenous hERG activity and slow the gating of exogenous Kv2.1.|$|E
25|$|CO {{functions}} as an <b>endogenous</b> signaling molecule.|$|E
25|$|Minute {{quantity}} amounts (average 196 ppb) of <b>endogenous</b> ethanol and acetaldehyde {{were found}} in the exhaled breath of healthy volunteers. Auto-brewery syndrome, also known as gut fermentation syndrome, is a rare medical condition in which intoxicating quantities of ethanol are produced through <b>endogenous</b> fermentation within the digestive system.|$|E
25|$|<b>Endogenous</b> opioids include endorphins, enkephalins, dynorphins, {{and even}} {{morphine}} itself. Morphine appears to mimic endorphins. Endorphins, a contraction {{of the term}} <b>endogenous</b> morphines, are responsible for analgesia (reducing pain), causing sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or excitement.|$|E
25|$|The {{handling}} of lipoprotein {{particles in the}} body {{is referred to as}} lipoprotein particle metabolism. It is divided into two pathways, exogenous and <b>endogenous,</b> depending in large part on whether the lipoprotein particles in question are composed chiefly of dietary (exogenous) lipids or whether they originated in the liver (<b>endogenous),</b> through de novo synthesis of triacylglycerols.|$|E
25|$|Dehydroandrosterone (DHA) is the 3α-epimer of DHEA {{and is also}} an <b>endogenous</b> androgen.|$|E
25|$|A {{study found}} that fruit consumption, a source of <b>endogenous</b> {{methanol}} metabolized pectin.|$|E
25|$|THC and its <b>endogenous</b> {{equivalent}} anandamide additionally {{interact with}} glycine receptors.|$|E
25|$|Other <b>endogenous</b> estrogens, the biosyntheses {{of which}} do not involve aromatase, include 27-hydroxycholesterol, {{dehydroepiandrosterone}} (DHEA), 7-oxo-DHEA, 7α-hydroxy-DHEA, 16α-hydroxy-DHEA, 7β-hydroxyepiandrosterone, androstenedione (A4), androstenediol (A5), 3α-androstanediol, and 3β-androstanediol, and may have important <b>endogenous</b> functions as estrogens. Some estrogen metabolites, such as the catechol estrogens 2-hydroxyestradiol, 2-hydroxyestrone, 4-hydroxyestradiol, and 4-hydroxyestrone, as well as 16α-hydroxyestrone, are also estrogens {{with varying degrees of}} activity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Endogenous</b> cannabinoids ("endocannabinoids") were {{discovered}} in cow's milk and soft cheeses.|$|E
25|$|This {{equilibrium}} {{is usually}} known as Cournot equilibrium with <b>endogenous</b> entry, or Marshall equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|Angiogenesis {{inhibitor}} can be <b>endogenous</b> or {{come from}} outside as drug or a dietary component.|$|E
25|$|Genotropin (Growth hormone) {{for growth}} failure {{due to an}} {{inadequate}} secretion of <b>endogenous</b> growth hormone.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, {{there was}} {{discovery}} of <b>endogenous</b> morphine occurring naturally {{in the human}} body. Thirty years of speculation were made on this subject {{because there was a}} receptor that, it appeared, reacted only to morphine: the μ3-opioid receptor in human tissue. Human cells that form in reaction to cancerous neuroblastoma cells have been found to contain trace amounts of <b>endogenous</b> morphine.|$|E
25|$|The {{notion of}} {{complementarity}} between exogenous and <b>endogenous</b> variables is formally captured by single crossing differences.|$|E
25|$|<b>Endogenous</b> antigens are {{produced}} by intracellular bacteria and viruses replicating within a host cell.The host cell uses enzymes to digest virally associated proteins, and displays these pieces on its surface to T-cells by coupling them to MHC. <b>Endogenous</b> antigens are typically displayed on MHC class I molecules, and activate CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells. With the exception of non-nucleated cells (including erythrocytes), MHC class I is expressed by all host cells.|$|E
25|$|Endomorphin acts through μ-opioid receptors, and is {{more potent}} than other <b>endogenous</b> opioids at these receptors.|$|E
25|$|Examples include {{nicotine}} (by definition), acetylcholine (the <b>endogenous</b> agonist of nAChRs), choline, epibatidine, lobeline, varenicline and cytisine.|$|E

25|$|The primary <b>endogenous</b> ligands of {{the human}} TAAR1 (hTAAR1) receptor, by rank order of potency, are:tyramine> β-phenethylamine> dopamine= octopamine.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of CRISPR {{sequences}} revealed coevolution of {{host and}} viral genomes. Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in pathogenic and commensal bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation {{may contribute to}} the regulation of <b>endogenous</b> bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, Francisella novicida uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an <b>endogenous</b> transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein that is critical for F. novicida to dampen host response and promote virulence.|$|E
25|$|Some {{authors have}} shown that <b>endogenous</b> methane is {{produced}} {{not only by the}} intestinal flora and then absorbed into the blood, but also is produced - in small amounts - by eukaryotic cells (during process of lipid peroxidation). And they have also shown that the <b>endogenous</b> methane production rises during an experimental mitochondrial hypoxia, for example, sodium azide intoxication. They thought that methane could be one of intercellular signals of hypoxia and stress.|$|E

25|$|Methanol is {{poisonous}} to {{the central}} nervous system and may cause blindness, coma, and death. However, in small amounts, methanol is a natural <b>endogenous</b> compound found in normal, healthy human individuals, concluded by one study which found a mean of 4.5ppm in the exhaled breath of subjects. The mean <b>endogenous</b> methanol in humans of 0.45 g/d may be metabolized from pectin found in fruit; one kilogram of apple produces up to 1.4 g methanol.|$|E
