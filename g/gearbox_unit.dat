This design was like the full enclosure of a scooter, but unlike a scooter the engine and <b>gearbox</b> <b>unit</b> was not fixed to the rear axle. This had several benefits. It moved the engine down {{and away from the}} seat, detaching the rear swingarm motion from the drivetrain for lower unsprung weight. It also made engine cooling air flow more direct, and made it possible to fit larger wheels. Placing the engine {{in the center of the}} frame, rather than close to the rear wheel, greatly improved front-rear balance. The fuel tank was located under the hinged seat, which opened to reveal the fuel filler inlet. The 17inch wheels, in comparison to the typical 10inch wheels of a scooter, were more stable, particularly on rough roads, and psychologically made the motorcycle more familiar, having an appearance closer to a bicycle than a small-wheel scooter.|$|E
25|$|The AC Ace LM Prototype was {{a single}} piece from the year 1958 with the unusual chassis number LM5000, which John Tojeiro {{designed}} {{on behalf of the}} brothers Hurlock specifically for the AC factory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans and for further long distance racing]. The vehicle was only 737-kilogram and differed fundamentally from the standard model: it had a load-bearing, lightweight, tubular steel frame without the massive ladder structure, a new front axle with single wheel suspension, this time in the form of upper and lower triangular steering with coil spring / shock units, and a newly designed pendulum axle at the rear. The open aluminium body was much flatter, with larger overhangs at the front and rear and aerodynamically rounded with a lowered down front and high tail. It was designed by the body builder Cavendish Morton. The engine/ transmission unit, a tuned production unit, came from the Bristol Type 100D2 / S. After a test ride on the Brooklands circuit, just a few kilometres from the AC factory, the prototype, which was not yet mature, completed two assignments in 1958: in June as a factory car in the Le Mans 24-hour race and in September in the Rudac Racing Team at the RAC Tourist Trophy at the Goodwood Circuit. Due to changes in the regulations, the car was no longer able to compete in the next-class category in the FIA - Sportscar World Championship. The 'Bristol' engine / <b>gearbox</b> <b>unit</b> went back there, the racing car was sold without drive and later rebuilt. It still exists today as a collector's item.|$|E

The carbon fibre monocoque was constructed at Toyota Motorsport's headquarters in Cologne which built 84% of the chassis, and performed aerodynamic development of the design in its wind tunnel. Designers were influenced by findings from outdated Dome chassis and impressions from current Audi and Peugeot monocoques. The suspension setup consisted of an independent double wishbone system with pushrod actuated dampers, and was designed to accommodate wide tyres.

Their whole engine-transmission system was based on that from the main bus manufacturers of the period such as Leyland and AEC. Gear selection was by the train driver with a hand-held lever as the train accelerated. Such trains were formed {{of a number of}} such railcars coupled together and each power car had two engine/automated <b>gearbox</b> <b>units</b> mounted under the floor. Synchronising controls by control cables connected through the train ensured all the gearboxes under all coaches of the train changed gear together.|$|R

50|$|The {{engine and}} <b>gearbox</b> <b>unit</b> had four live rubber {{mountings}} and the silencer and exhaust pipe were similarly insulated. The frame was rigidly cross braced with the deep side members dropped {{in order to}} give a low body mounting.

50|$|IWL's first {{production}} model, {{named the}} Pitty, was launched early in 1955 at a retail price of 2,300 Marks. The Pittys front wheel had leading link suspension, while its rear wheel had hydraulically damped swingarm suspension {{on which the}} engine and <b>gearbox</b> <b>unit</b> was mounted: an arrangement that Vespa had pioneered.

Hydraulic shock absorbers are now fitted at the back. Then The Times commented that their correspondent believed the one-piece screen should open a little wider to give an uninterrupted direct view in bad weather. The springing might be better with hydraulic shock absorbers all round. Driving is simple and not tiring and travel is comfortable on most occasions. Highest comfortable speed was 65 mph and added [...] "It took a little working up".|$|E
5000|$|The Brough Superior Austin Four was a limited-production {{motorcycle}} {{designed and}} manufactured by Brough Superior of Nottingham, UK in 1932.

The machine is unique in its design, being powered by a modified Austin 7 automobile engine and <b>gearbox</b> <b>unit,</b> from which a driveshaft emerges on the center-line of the motor. Rather than design a new gearbox, George Brough had the inspiration to keep the central driveshaft, and use a pair of close-couple rear wheels driven by a central final drive box.

5000|$|The car {{was based}} on BMC Mini {{mechanical}} components with the transverse engine and <b>gearbox</b> <b>unit</b> mounted in a mid-engine configuration. A strong square tubular spaceframe chassis with integral roll-over protection was produced by racing car specialist Arch Motors and was bonded to a fibreglass body made by Specialised Mouldings who supplied many of the top sports, racing and F1 constructors of the day. The end product was a light yet rigid structure, with all-round independent coil spring and wishbone suspension. Combining light weight, a low centre of gravity and low aerodynamic drag from a body that measured just 40.5 in high, the Unipower GT offered very good performance and excellent road holding and handling characteristics. Available with the 998 cc Mini-Cooper or more potent 1275 cc Cooper [...] "S" [...] engine, this later version {{was reported to be}} capable of 0-60 mph in around 8 seconds and to have a maximum speed of almost 120 mi/h km/h.|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the failures of <b>gearbox</b> <b>units</b> after about 10, 000 service hours when the design service life of 45, 000 hours was expected was performed to establish the cause of failure.

The failed gear components were examined visually and metallurgically. Lubrication oil used in the gearboxes was examined for consistency with manufacturer’s standards. The observed failures were due to design and manufacturing errors: for instance, the duty load on the gear teeth exceeded the maximum tooth beam strength, allowable dynamic load and limiting wear load. The out-of-tolerance surface finish also contributed as it resulted in the misalignment of pinions and gears. To prevent these failures required adequate sizing of the gear teeth and face width as well as better choice of materials with higher allowable static stresses to bear the loads imposed. The surface roughness should be within tolerance...|$|R

5000|$|The Super Cub {{has been}} {{compared}} to the Ford Model T, Volkswagen Beetle and the Jeep as an icon of 20th century industry and transport. The C100 used a pressed steel monocoque chassis, with the horizontal engine placed below the central spine, a configuration now called the 'step through' or 'underbone' motorcycle. By some criteria, the type of motorcycle the Super Cub falls into is difficult to classify, landing somewhere between a scooter and a motorcycle, and sometimes it was called a moped, [...] "", or scooterette.

Though some of the many Super Cub variations came with both kick and electric start, the majority sold well without it. Even the latest 2011 model year Japanese domestic market (JDM) Super Cub 50 and Super Cub 110 versions, with modern technology and conveniences like fuel injection and a fuel gauge, were not offered with an electric start option.|$|E

40|$|A portal {{axle unit}} is a <b>gearbox</b> <b>unit</b> {{installed}} on {{a vehicle for}} higher ground clearance and driving in off-road conditions. Shafts must be exceptionally tough and light to improve the overall performance of the portal axle unit. In this paper, a hollow shaft with a rib at both ends was proposed. The torsional stress of the three-dimensional shaft model was determined using finite element analysis (FEA) and validated by experimental testing. The hollow shaft thickness, rib thickness, depth of spokes, rib fillet radius, and number of spokes are the five of parameters considered in the torsional strength analysis of the rib. A Taguchi orthogonal array (L 25) was applied to determine the optimum set of parameters for the proposed shaft. The strength and weight of the optimized model were calculated and compared to the solid shaft, hollow shaft, and proposed model. The optimized model showed improvement in torsional strength with {{a slight increase in}} weight compared to the benchmark model...|$|E
40|$|The topic {{addressed}} in this PhD thesis {{is the development of}} a rotational Lumped Parameter model to analyze the dynamic behavior of planetary gearbox. This model allows the study of the gearbox torsional vibrations. In particular, the study carried out in this thesis has focused on simple planetary trains, with three planets and an the outer fix ring. Therefore the following five rotational degree of freedom have been taken into account: the sun rotation, the rotation of the three planets and the carrier rotation. In {{the first part of the}} work, the attention has been focused on a correct description of the gearbox geometry (especially on the toothed wheels geometry) and on the operating characteristics, such as pressure angles and center to center distance. The definition of the geometry was then used for the development of a complex finite element model that, combined with an analytical formulation, allows to obtain the meshing stiffness, depending on the operating conditions of the gearbox. This meshing stiffness was used in the lumped parameter model to define the meshing forces, formed from an elastic component and from a viscous damping component. In addition to the meshing forces, the lumped parameter model considers the inertial actions and the external actions given by the driving torque and the resistant torque. From the simulation results it is possible to analyze the instantaneous angular velocity, the instantaneous angular acceleration of all wheels in different operating conditions, the variation of the meshing stiffness and the forces variations during the gearbox operations. The model is ready for an extension to the translational degrees of freedom, for which the formulation has already been developed. After having developed the entire model, some experimental tests were carried out in order to acquire the torsional vibratory signals of the <b>gearbox</b> <b>unit</b> studied. The tests were performed at different rotational speeds and with different torques applied. The experimental signals obtained have been used to validate the theoretical model. Overall, the research activity is scientifically relevant because it allows, through the development of a lumped parameter model, the study of torsional vibrations of planetary gear units. The model includes the most relevant dynamic phenomena involved in the gearbox, thus allowing the evaluation of the forces that mainly determine the vibrational signature of the studied gearbox. For this reason, the model can be considered a useful tool to support the design and prototyping, as it allows to identify the causes of undesirable dynamic effects and allows to evaluate the effect of any design changes on the dynamic behavior of the gearbox...|$|E
