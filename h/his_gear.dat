It was unsure if the test would last five days and the Queen was meant to attend on day five. If the match {{finished}} early they planned to play a one-day game; Turner was asked to bring <b>his</b> <b>gear</b> to Melbourne as McCosker's replacement. However the game ended up going for five days.|$|E

The Orcs found Frodo's body and stripped him of <b>his</b> <b>gear,</b> but Sam (thinking his friend dead) had already secured the Ring. Frodo regained consciousness and was freed from the orcs by Sam, and the two started the grueling journey across the plains of Mordor towards Mount Doom.|$|E
25|$|By the 1880s, the {{expansion}} of the cattle industry resulted in a need for additional open range. Thus many ranchers expanded into the northwest, where there were still large tracts of unsettled grassland. Texas cattle were herded north, into the Rocky Mountain west and the Dakotas. The cowboy adapted much of <b>his</b> <b>gear</b> to the colder conditions, and westward movement of the industry also led to intermingling of regional traditions from California to Texas, often with the cowboy taking the most useful elements of each.|$|E

25|$|The {{two were}} quickly {{joined by a}} {{counter-attack}} from Axel Merckx and Sandy Casar; Boogerd and Lefevre sat up and allowed those two to join them. Casar struck a dog on the road when he and Frederick Willems were chasing Boogerd and Lefevre, {{and both of them}} went down. Casar got up quickly, but Willems was slower and wound up being absorbed by the peloton. The crash resulted in Casar tearing <b>his</b> <b>gear</b> and having to ride with a nasty wound on his exposed buttocks, since dropping off to change and have the wound treated would cost him his position. Later, the race doctor's car made it up to the leading group to tend to Casar's hip and right elbow, as well as a bee sting sustained by Boogerd.|$|E
25|$|Young, naive Canadian {{biologist}} Tyler (Charles Martin Smith) {{is assigned}} {{by the government to}} travel to the isolated Canadian arctic wilderness and study why the area's caribou population is declining, believed to be due to wolf-pack attacks; amongst his orders to study them he is also given a gun and required to kill one wolf and examine its stomach contents. Tyler receives a baptism of fire into bush life with a trip by bush plane piloted by Rosie (Brian Dennehy). After landing at the destination, Rosie leaves Tyler {{in the middle of a}} sub-zero frozen Arctic lake.

Pacquiao was expected to feature {{a number of major}} sponsorships on <b>his</b> <b>gear,</b> providing an estimated $2.25 million in additional revenue. Among them were long-time sponsors, such as Air Asia, Cafe Puro, and Motolite. Daily fantasy sports service FanDuel acquired sponsorship rights for Mayweather, including waistband branding, and a block of tickets that were given away through an on-site sweepstakes.

500|$|After {{the crash}} {{between himself and}} Burti on the first lap, Michael Schumacher said that {{although}} he saw Burti in his rear-view mirrors, {{he did not know}} which line he wanted to take and he could not take avoiding action because of <b>his</b> <b>gear</b> selection problem. Burti said that the accident [...] "looked worse on TV" [...] and that he stated his spin on lap 18 was caused because his left arm was aching from the crash. Coulthard questioned the decision to stop the race by saying: [...] "Accidents or injury off the track is not normally a reason to stop the race. There's lots of races that would have benefited from being red-flagged to give people a show." [...] He also said he felt consistency was needed but accepted that the organisers had the final say on stopping a race. Villeneuve also agreed with Coulthard's view. A spokesman for the FIA confirmed and defended the red-flag decision and they said it was shown to prevent a larger accident. Michelin Motorsport Director Pierre Dupasquier agreed with the FIA's view and stated he was concerned about cars hitting the strands of debris and catching a puncture.|$|E

Capital FM described the video as [...] "lots of shots of people having fun in the sun". Melinda Newman from Hitfix praised Rowland's role in the clip saying that [...] Some criticism did follow the video. Capital FM radio station felt that Guetta's appearance in the clip was slightly disappointing. [...] "Guetta looks a bit like a binman pushing <b>his</b> <b>gear</b> round the streets in some of the earlier shots in the video". Newman said that the video's director, Jonas Åkerlund, had removed something from the song.

500|$|Due to {{the limited}} fuel allowance, the cars were towed to the start line by horses. The first car, a Rolls-Royce being driven by Charles Rolls, started at 9am, and the {{following}} 41 cars were released at one minute intervals. Due to the fuel-saving nature of the event most of the drivers began the race by letting their car coast down the initial slope under its own momentum before engaging gear. Early on the first lap of the race Rolls heard a crunching noise from <b>his</b> <b>gear</b> box and the car stopped. He claimed that upon investigation he discovered that small nuts and screws had been dropped into the gearbox, which had smashed a gear. Rolls claimed that this [...] "was a common trick abroad" [...] but voiced surprise at it happening in an English race. There was further speculation of foul play when {{it was discovered that}} Arnott's Minerva had been tampered with; two spark plugs had been smashed and an air valve bent, causing his engine to overheat. Before the race Rolls and Arnott had been two of the favourites, and The Automobile magazine said that [...] "this unfortunate incident has greatly detracted from the success of the race." ...|$|E

A total of approximately 100,000 spectators attended the race. As the drivers were preparing to start the formation lap, both Minardis were in the pit lane due to technical difficulties. Both Alonso and Marques initially started from the pit lane. Both Williams drivers maintained first and second positions going into the first corner. Further back, Michael Schumacher slowed with an issue with <b>his</b> <b>gear</b> selection, which resulted in drivers being forced to swerve to avoid him. Burti was unable to view the Ferrari as Panis was blocking his view and hit the rear of Schumacher's car, launching Burti {{into the air and}} he rolled over the top on Bernoldi's vehicle's and narrowly landed on Verstappen's Arrows. Burti's car lost one of its wheels, landing of Bernoldi's Arrows which resulted in a broken engine cover and rear wing for the Brazilian. Burti's car bounced across the gravel trap and came to a rest on the Nordkurve corner tyre barriers. The race was red-flagged as strands of carbon fibre were scattered across the track and marshals were needed to clear the debris.|$|E

500|$|Xenogears {{centers around}} the protagonist Fei Fong Wong, an adopted young male {{in the village of}} Lahan, brought by a mysterious [...] "masked man" [...] three years ago. The events {{surrounding}} Fei's arrival at the village cause him to have retrograde amnesia. During an attack on Lahan from Gebler, Fei pilots an empty gear and fights the enemy, accidentally destroying the village. As a result, Fei and Citan, the village's doctor, decide to leave with the abandoned gear to get it away from the village. Fei meets Elly, a Gebler officer {{who was a member of}} a squad of gears who had tried to steal the gear Fei would eventually take, before she crashed in Lahan during a chase, starting the fateful fight, and Grahf, who claims to know about Fei's past and admits to spearheading the attack on Lahan to unlock Fei's abilities. Eventually, Fei and Citan are picked up by Bart, a desert pirate and heir to the throne of Aveh. Fei again loses control of himself inside <b>his</b> <b>gear</b> while Bart and Citan are attacked by an unknown red gear. Fei wakes up in a Kislev prison and meets Wiseman, a mysterious masked man, who originally brought Fei to Lahan.

Afterward, Billy, an Ethos worker onboard Thames, allows Fei to use the Ethos' advanced medical technology. Bishop Stone, Ethos' leader, reveals to the party Ethos's true purpose of controlling the land dwellers, or [...] "Lambs", for Solaris. The group follows Stone to Zeboim, an excavation site. They discover a young girl composed of nanomachines, which is what Krelian, a Solarian leader, seeks. Stone takes the girl while the group fights Id, the mysterious red gear's pilot, who wants the girl, but is stopped by Wiseman. The group returns and finds Fei awake and standing at <b>his</b> <b>gear</b> with a case of anterograde amnesia. Fei and his friends decide to ally themselves with the floating city of Shevat, the only remaining city capable of resisting Solaris, joined by Shevat locals Maria and Chu-Chu. During this time, Bart regains his throne and initiates peace {{between the two countries}} and Stone is destroyed. Upon entering Solaris, they encounter Emeralda, the nanomachine colony. She attacks at first, but recognizes Fei, referring to him as [...] "Kim", much to Fei's confusion. In Solaris, Fei learns that Citan has been working for Emperor Cain, though he's actually a double agent on their side, and that Solaris has been producing food and medicine out of recycled humans in the Soylent System facility. The party also learns that the Gazel Ministry seeks to revive God and achieve eternal life, while Krelian seeks to possess Elly. Back at Shevat, Citan informs his friends that Id is actually Fei's split personality, with Fei's gear turning red when he switches to Id due to their connection.|$|E
