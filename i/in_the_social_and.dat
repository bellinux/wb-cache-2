5|$|Nonetheless, the Portuguese {{presence}} on the Angolan coast remained limited {{for much of the}} colonial period. The degree of real colonial settlement was minor, and, with few exceptions, the Portuguese did not interfere by means other than commercial <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> political dynamics of the native peoples. There was no real delimitation of territory; Angola, to all intents and purposes, did not yet exist.|$|E

In 1932 Rossen directed John Wexley's Steel, about labor agitation, and Richard Maibaum's The Tree, about a lynching. A year later Rossen directed Birthright, in which Maibaum attacked Nazism, which had just triumphed in Germany with the dictatorship of Adolf Hitler in 1933.|$|E

5|$|Regardless of the {{political}} relationship between Æthelberht and the Franks, there is abundant evidence of strong connections across the English Channel. There was a luxury trade between Kent and the Franks, and burial artefacts found include clothing, drink, and weapons that reflect Frankish cultural influence. The Kentish burials have a greater range of imported goods {{than those of the}} neighbouring Anglo-Saxon regions, which is not surprising given Kent's easier access to trade across the English Channel. In addition, the grave goods are both richer and more numerous in Kentish graves, implying that material wealth was derived from that trade. Frankish influences also may be detected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> agrarian organization of Kent. Other cultural influences may be seen in the burials as well, so {{it is not necessary to}} presume that there was direct settlement by the Franks in Kent.|$|E

5|$|While the Crusades had causes {{deeply rooted}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> {{political}} situations of 11th-century Europe, the event actually triggering the First Crusade was {{a request for}} assistance from Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos. Alexios {{was worried about the}} advances of the Seljuqs, who had reached as far west as Nicaea, not far from Constantinople. In March 1095, Alexios sent envoys to the Council of Piacenza to ask Pope Urban II for aid against the Turks.|$|E

As an adult, Woodruff was a farmer, horticulturist and stockman by trade and wrote extensively for church periodicals.|$|E

25|$|The vast wealth {{generated}} by oil revenues {{was beginning to}} have an even greater impact on Saudi society. It led to rapid technological (but not cultural) modernisation, urbanization, mass public education {{and the creation of}} new media. This and the presence of increasingly large numbers of foreign workers greatly affected traditional Saudi norms and values. Although there was dramatic change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> economic life of the country, political power continued to be monopolized by the royal family leading to discontent among many Saudis who began to look for wider participation in government.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s Duarte Costa became deeply {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> political {{changes taking place}} in Brazil. Brazil's economy had collapsed in 1929 {{as a result of the}} Great Depression and a populist military regime had taken over the government in 1930. Led by Getúlio Vargas, the new government had an erratic policy record in its early years, sometimes anti-clerical and anti-aristocratic, sometimes swinging the opposite direction. In 1932, Duarte Costa became a leading spokesman for the Catholic Electoral League, which was organized by the church to lobby for Christian principles in the laws and acts of the government.|$|E
25|$|Though it is {{gradually}} increasing, the female literacy rate in India {{is less than}} the male literacy rate. Far fewer girls than boys are enrolled in school, and many girls drop out. In urban India, girls are nearly on a par with boys in terms of education. However, in rural India, girls continue to be less educated than boys. According to the National Sample Survey Data of 1997, only the states of Kerala and Mizoram have approached universal female literacy. According to scholars, the major factor behind improvements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> economic status of women in Kerala is literacy.|$|E

25|$|Rural women, {{although}} poor, are independent, better organised, socially outspoken. According {{to another}} local custom, women {{can choose to}} terminate a marriage relationship through a custom called chudi pahanana, if she desires. Most of the old temples and shrines here are related to 'women power' (e.g., Shabari, Mahamaya, Danteshwari) {{and the existence of}} these temples gives insight into historical and current social fabric of this state. However, a mention of these progressive local customs in no way suggests that the ideology of female subservience does not exist in Chhattisgarh. On the contrary, the male authority and dominance is seen quite clearly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> cultural life.|$|E
