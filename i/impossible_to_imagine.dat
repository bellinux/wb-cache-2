Since Chadwick's Barbican organised retrospective, the full measure of her contribution to the trajectory of contemporary British art is starting to be realised. The Richard Saltoun Gallery in London represents the estate of Helen Chadwick and has continued to show the artists work. Works From The Estate (2013) marked what would have been the artists 60th birthday, showing some of Chadwick's most famous works. The following year Bad Blooms (2014) exhibited Chadwick's Wreaths of Pleasure (1992–93).|$|E
25|$|First Jackson {{argued that}} qualia are epiphenomenal: not causally efficacious {{with respect to}} the {{physical}} world. Jackson does not give a positive justification for this claim—rather, he seems to assert it simply because it defends qualia against the classic problem of dualism. Our natural assumption would be that qualia must be causally efficacious in the physical world, but some would ask how we could argue for their existence if they did not affect our brains. If qualia are to be non-physical properties (which they must be in order to constitute an argument against physicalism), some argue that it is almost <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> how they could have a causal effect on the physical world. By redefining qualia as epiphenomenal, Jackson attempts to protect them from the demand of playing a causal role.|$|E

25|$|Collins's seminal {{recording}} {{is considered}} by many to be Anthems in Eden, released in 1969 (and the first to be credited to Shirley and Dolly Collins). It featured a suite of songs centred on the changes in rural England brought about by the First World War. Dolly Collins created arrangements featuring David Munrow and various other players from his Early Music Consort. The highly unusual combination of ancient instruments included rebecs, sackbuts, viols and crumhorns. Several critics have suggested that it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> that electric accompaniment for traditional song, as successfully purveyed by Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span, could have developed quite as it did without the pioneering Anthems in Eden. All these recordings strove to marry a deep love and understanding of the English folk music heritage with a more contemporary attitude to musical settings. Anthems in Eden was followed by Love, Death and the Lady, also co-credited with Dolly, in 1970.|$|E

500|$|Marquee Moon {{was also}} one of the most {{influential}} records from the 1970s and has been cited by critics as a cornerstone of alternative rock. It heavily influenced the indie rock movement of the 1980s, while post-punk acts appropriated the album's uncluttered production, introspective tone, and meticulously performed instrumentation. Hunter Felt from PopMatters attributed Marquee Moons influence on post-punk and new wave acts to the precisely syncopated rhythm section of Fred Smith and Billy Ficca. He recommended 2003's [...] "definitive" [...] reissue of the album to listeners of garage rock revival bands, who he said had modeled themselves after Verlaine's Romantic poetry-inspired lyrics and the [...] "jaded yet somehow impassioned cynicism" [...] of his vocals. According to Sputnikmusic's Adam Downer, Television introduced an unprecedented style of rock and roll on Marquee Moon that inaugurated post-punk music, while The Guardian said it scaled [...] "amazing new heights of sophistication and intensity" [...] as a [...] "gorgeous, ringing beacon of post-punk" [...] despite being released several months before the Sex Pistols' Never Mind the Bollocks (1977). AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine believed the record was innovative for abandoning previous New York punk albums' swing and groove sensibilities in favor of an intellectually stimulating scope that Television achieved instrumentally rather than lyrically. Erlewine claimed [...] "it's <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> post-punk soundscapes" [...] without Marquee Moon. Fletcher argued that the songs' lack of compression, groove, and unnecessary effects provided [...] "a blueprint for a form of chromatic, rather than rhythmic, music that would later come to be called angular".|$|E

[...] Celebrating the album's twenty-year anniversary, Emily Mackay of NME wrote the album [...] "put the lie to the post-grunge assumption that heartfelt, passionate solo artistry came in the form of acoustic guitar and heartbreak, creating a new breed of singer-songwriter." [...] Dubbing it an [...] "influential masterpiece", she found influences of the album in the work of musicians such as M.I.A., Grimes, These New Puritans and Tune-Yards, writing: [...] "It's in fascinatingly individual artists like those that you'll find [...] influence — not, as many would have you believe, in every pretty-faced girl with a big voice."
