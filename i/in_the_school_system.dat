5|$|In 1937, {{when the}} {{government}} required that Hindi be taught <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>system,</b> E.V. Ramasamy organised opposition to this policy through the Justice Party. After 1937, the Dravidian movement derived considerable support from the student community. In later years, opposition to Hindi played {{a big role in}} the politics of Tamil Nadu. The fear of the Hindi language had its origin in the conflict between Brahmins and non-Brahmins. To the Tamils, acceptance of Hindi <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>system</b> was a form of bondage. When the Justice Party weakened in the absence of mass support, E.V. Ramasamy took over the leadership of the party after being jailed for opposing Hindi in 1939. Under his tutelage the party prospered, but the party's conservative members, most of whom were rich and educated, withdrew from active participation.|$|E

25|$|Behavior {{therapy is}} a rich tradition. It is well {{researched}} with a strong evidence base. Its roots are in behaviorism. In behavior therapy, environmental events predict {{the way we think}} and feel. Our behavior sets up conditions for the environment to feedback back on it. Sometimes the feedback leads the behavior to increase- reinforcement and sometimes the behavior decreases- punishment. Oftentimes behavior therapists are called applied behavior analysis. They have studied many areas from developmental disabilities to depression and anxiety disorders. In the area of mental health and addictions a recent article looked at APA's list for well established and promising practices and found a considerable number of them based on the principles of operant and respondent conditioning. Multiple assessment techniques have come from this approach including functional analysis (psychology), which has found a strong focus <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>system.</b> In addition, multiple intervention programs have come from this tradition including community reinforcement approach for treating addictions, acceptance and commitment therapy, functional analytic psychotherapy, including dialectic behavior therapy and behavioral activation. In addition, specific techniques such as contingency management and exposure therapy have come from this tradition.|$|E

500|$|The first {{nationwide}} government-funded {{school system}} in China {{was established in the}} year 3 AD under Emperor Ping of Han (9 BC–5 AD). During the Northern Song dynasty, the government gradually reestablished an official school system after it was heavily damaged during the preceding Five Dynasties period. Government-established schools soon eclipsed the role of private academies by the mid-11th century. At the apex of higher education <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>system</b> were the central schools located in the capital city, the Guozijian, the Taixue, and several vocational schools. The first major reform effort to rebuild prefectural and county schools was initiated by Chancellor Fan Zhongyan (989–1052) in the 1040s. Before this time, the bulk of funds allotted for the establishment of prefectural and county schools was left up to private financing and minimal amount of government funding; Fan's reform effort started the trend of greater government financing, at least for prefectural schools. Major expansion of educational facilities was initiated by Emperor Huizong, who used funds originally allotted for disaster relief and food-price stabilizing to fund new prefectural and county schools and demoted officials who neglected to repair, rebuild, and maintain these government schools. The historian John W. Chaffe states that by the early 12th century the state school system had [...] of land that could provide for some 200,000 student residents living in dormitories. After the widespread destruction of schools during the Jurchen invasions from the 1120s to 1140s, Emperor Gaozong of Song (r. 1127–1162) issued an edict to restore prefectural schools in 1142 and county schools in 1148, although the county schools by and large were reconstructed by the efforts of local county officials' private fundraising.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{school psychologists}} are {{traditionally}} viewed as “gate-keepers” of special education due to their assessment work with individual students, school psychologists’ roles have expanded as they are assuming leadership positions in schools by taking a more systemic approach to school psychology. [...] School psychologists’ expertise and knowledge in understanding human behavior, collaboration, collecting data and problem-solving are being recognized and called upon by schools {{in order to achieve}} legislative requirements and standards such as those mandated by Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (IDEA 2004) and No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) (Curtis, Castillo, & Cohen, 2009). [...] At a systems-level, school psychologists collect data regarding school-wide practices such as reading programs, disciplinary methods, or social issues and make decisions to promote and affect the well-being of all students <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>system.</b> [...] When change occurs at the systems-level, children receive the best results because issues and problems are typically prevented before the problems have a chance to develop or are intervened early enough before problems get out of hand.

2500|$|In much of China’s recent history, {{liberalism}} and individualism, never {{an integral part}} of Chinese culture, have been under pressure from nationalism and socialism. Emphasis on collectivism rather than individual expression would necessarily prompt differences in the music that is produced. In China, the government encouraged collectivism in order to secure political power and to have more control over the population of well over 1.6 billion in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). As conditions began to change after the 1970s and over the next several decades Chinese popular music came {{to be used as a}} powerful force among the people to challenge government control on self-expression outside the officially tolerated range and to push the boundaries of cultural norms to create change (Matusitz, 2010). Individualism can be expressed or, at least, [...] implied in popular music and can influence youth to seek new ideas dramatically different from those of earlier generations, and young performers use popular music to express their own feelings and articulate those of their peers. [...] However, in Chinese officially sanctioned music schools, teaching popular music usually involves praising China’s national culture through song lyrics that echo the official orientation of the PRC. The way in which popular music is taught <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>system</b> relates to Chinese nationalism, as [...] educational policy is heavily influenced by the government, and the “… Chinese government still uses traditional Chinese culture and values to enhance its legitimacy and consolidate its authority” (Ho, 2012, p1).|$|E
