25|$|At {{the age of}} seventeen, he was {{employed}} in Huliaipole itself as an apprentice painter, then as a worker in a local iron foundry and ultimately as a <b>foundryman</b> in the same organization. During this time he became involved in revolutionary politics. His involvement was based on his experiences of injustice at work and the terrorism of the Tsarist regime during the 1905 revolution. In 1906, Makhno joined the anarchist organization in Huliaipole. He was arrested in 1906, tried, and acquitted. He was again arrested in 1907, but could not be incriminated, and the charges were dropped. The third arrest came in 1908 when an infiltrator was able to testify against Makhno. In 1910 Makhno {{was sentenced to death}} by hanging, but the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and he was sent to Butyrskaya prison in Moscow. In prison he came under the influence of his intellectual cellmate Piotr Arshinov. He was released from prison after the February Revolution in 1917.|$|E

50|$|For {{a number}} of years prior to the {{founding}} of the Society many local bodies of <b>foundrymen</b> met for mutual protection in regards to labor, prices and interchange of technical information. The attendance was usually strong in these organizations in times of prosperity but waned when economic conditions slowed. Early in 1896 the Philadelphia Foundrymen's Society through discussion with its members conceived that a more general, larger benefit might be gained through organizing a wider group of <b>foundrymen.</b> They invited <b>foundrymen</b> from around the country to Philadelphia for a meeting. The response was spontaneous and well received. On May 12, 1896 the American Foundrymen's Association was formed.|$|R

After graduating in 1951 from both the seventh grade and the vocational school (with honours in moldmaking and foundry-work), he was selected for further training at the Saratov Industrial Technical School, where he studied tractors. While in Saratov, Gagarin volunteered for weekend training as a Soviet air cadet at a local flying club, where he learned to fly — at first in a biplane and later in a Yak-18 trainer. He also earned extra money as a part-time dock laborer on the Volga River.|$|E

40|$|This paper starts {{based on}} an {{advanced}} simulation work about casting parts of wind power turbines made in ductile iron of high tenacity. The technical goal was extracted from the a research Project, carried out with Basque Country <b>Foundrymen</b> Association (Spanish <b>Foundrymen</b> Federation), two foundries, TS Fundiciones (Zestoa-Guipúzcoa) and Fundiciones Urbina (Urbina-Álava) as process suppliers and GAMESA Eólica (Huarte-Navarra) as part and geometry supplier. The study shows that nowadays it is already possible to obtain predictions with high accuracy in pouring and solidification simulations using simultaneously microstructure calculations and after these ones good predictions about final microstructures and so the subsequent mechanical properties of the castings. All concerning tasks in simulation have been made using FEM (Finite Elements Method). Referred to metallographic studies and tests, they were made at Inasmet-TECNALIA laboratories...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the validity of}} methanol (MeOH) and formic acid (FA) in urine as biological indicators of methyl formate (MF) exposure in experimental and field situations. METHODS: The subjects were 28 <b>foundrymen</b> and two groups of volunteers (20 control and 20 exposed). Exposure assessment of the workers was performed by personal air and biological monitoring. Methyl formate vapour collected on charcoal tube was analysed by gas chromatography. The concentration of MF in the exposure chamber (volunteer-study) was monitored by two independent methods [flame ionisation detection (FID) and Fourier transformation infra-red detection (FTIR) ]. Urinary metabolites (MeOH and FA) were analysed separately by headspace gas chromatography. RESULTS: The volunteers exposed to 100 ppm MF vapour at rest for 8 h excreted 3. 62 +/- 1. 13 mg MeOH/l (mean +/- SD) {{at the end of}} the exposure. This was statistically different (P &lt; 0. 001) from pre-exposure MeOH excretion (2. 15 +/- 0. 80 mg/ 1), or from that of controls (1. 69 +/- 0. 48 mg/l). The urinary FA excretion was 32. 2 +/- 11. 3 mg/g creatinine after the exposure, which was statistically different (P &lt; 0. 001) from pre-exposure excretion (18. 0 +/- 9. 3 mg/g creatinine) or that of controls (13. 8 +/- 7. 9 mg/g creatinine). In <b>foundrymen,</b> the urinary FA excretion after the 8 h workshift exposure to a time weighted average (TWA) concentration of 2 to 156 ppm MF showed a dose-dependent increase best modelled by a polynomial function. The highest urinary FA concentration was 129 mg/g creatinine. The pre-shift urinary FA of the <b>foundrymen</b> (18. 3 +/- 5. 6 mg/g creatinine) did not differ from that of controls (13. 8 +/- 7. 9 mg/g creatinine). The urinary MeOH excretion of the <b>foundrymen</b> after the shift, varied from &lt; 1 to 15. 4 mg/l, while the correlation with the preceding MF exposure was poor. The <b>foundrymen</b> excreted more (P = 0. 01) FA (2. 12 +/- 3. 56 mg/g creatinine) after the workshift than experimentally, once-exposed volunteers (0. 32 +/- 0. 11 mg/g creatinine) at a similar inhaled MF level of 1 ppm). CONCLUSIONS: In spite of its high background level in non-exposed subjects, urinary FA seems to be a useful biomarker of methyl formate exposure. The question remains as to what is the reason for the differences in chronic and acute exposure respectively...|$|R

2500|$|Exploitation of the Pittsburgh-seam coal began slowly. Initially, blacksmiths and <b>foundrymen</b> made coal into coke to use {{in their}} hearths and small furnaces. During the early nineteenth century, {{entrepreneurs}} in western Pennsylvania adapted British coke-making practices to produce coke for local iron works. To make coke, coal is burned under controlled conditions to drive off volatile matter (gases expelled when coal is burned), leaving carbon and ash from the coal fused together {{in the form of}} coke. They made coke in turf-covered [...] "mounds," [...] in which coal burned slowly and without oxygen to drive off impurities. [...] The adoption of beehive coke ovens in the 1830s spurred the use of Pittsburgh-seam coal in iron furnaces, and these ovens made better-quality coke than mounds.|$|R

Nevertheless, individuals and private investors are heavily involved in producing several thousands of tonnes of castings annually generating revenue for the government through taxation as well as helping with metal waste disposal.

These include quality issues due to lack of technical know-how, access to funding from both government and private financial institutions and foundry waste management.
