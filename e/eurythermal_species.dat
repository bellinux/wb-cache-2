50|$|D. lumholtzi is {{typically}} {{found in the}} warm, shallow regions of bodies of water with larger surface areas. While most species of Daphnia see high mortality at temperatures greater than 25 °C, D. lumholtzi individuals can survive and reproduce at temperatures up to 30 °C, with a thermal optimum occurring at 29 °C. Studies have shown that population density and water surface temperature are positively correlated. Once favorable temperatures are reached, {{such as those in}} the late summer, the previously deposited eggs hatch. The lower temperature range of D. lumholtzi extends to 5 °C, where some individuals are able to survive, with survival increasing significantly at 10 °C and reproduction beginning to occur at 15 °C. This significantly broad temperature range in which D. lumholtzi can survive has led to it being labeled a <b>eurythermal</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Ninespine Stickleback is a {{euryhaline}} and <b>eurythermal</b> <b>species</b> of teleost fish, occupying both freshwater {{and marine}} habitats in higher latitudes of the world. Recently, this species {{has been under}} great examination due to pond populations' adaptations of morphology, life history, and behavior which separates them from their marine conspecifics. Many recently isolated populations (<11,000 years) have been studied to identify ranges of phenotypic plasticity and possible genetic drift between populations. It {{has been found that}} marine populations exhibit metabolic rate reduction when in colder conditions, in addition to having an elevated hepatosomatic index (HSI) at all temperature conditions as compared to freshwater populations in those same conditions. Hepatosomatic index refers to the proportional size of the liver of the fish to its body mass, as in indication of energy reserves. In addition, certain freshwater pond populations have shown to be able to metabolically compensate to survive a wide range of temperatures, six degrees Celsius to nineteen degrees Celsius. Alterations to metabolic rate, such as decrease in standard metabolic rate, allowed pond population individuals to survive less than favorable conditions. Such physiological differences between populations has not been determined to be exclusively due to plasticity or generic changes; however, there {{has been found to be}} significant genetic diversity between marine and freshwater populations.|$|E
40|$|Background: In ectothermal {{animals such as}} fish, -temperature affects {{physiological}} and metabolic processes. This includes sensory organs such as the auditory system. The reported effects of temperature on hearing in eurythermal otophysines are contradictory. We therefore investigated {{the effect on the}} auditory system in species representing two different orders. Methodology/Principal Findings: Hearing sensitivity was determined using the auditory evoked potentials (AEP) recording technique. Auditory sensitivity and latency in response to clicks were measured in the common carp Cyprinus carpio (order Cypriniformes) and the Wels catfish Silurus glanis (order Siluriformes) after acclimating fish for at least three weeks to two different water temperatures (15 °C, 25 °C and again 15 °C). Hearing sensitivity increased with temperature in both species. Best hearing was detected between 0. 3 and 1 kHz at both temperatures. The maximum increase occurred at 0. 8 kHz (7. 8 dB) in C. carpio and at 0. 5 kHz (10. 3 dB) in S. glanis. The improvement differed between species and was in particular more pronounced in the catfish at 4 kHz. The latency in response to single clicks was measured from the onset of the sound stimulus to the most constant positive peak of the AEP. The latency decreased at the higher temperature in both species by 0. 37 ms on average. Conclusions/Significance: The current study shows that higher temperature improves hearing (lower thresholds, shorter latencies) in <b>eurythermal</b> <b>species</b> from different orders of otophysines.

30|$|Most organisms on Earth are ectotherms {{which have}} {{to survive and}} adapt to {{temperature}} fluctuations (Hochachka and Somero [2002]; Guschina and Harwood [2006]; Somero [2010]). Temperature fundamentally affects all aspects of physiology by influencing the reactive rates {{as well as the}} physical properties of biological molecules (Hochachka and Somero [2002]; Crockett and Londraville [2006]). For marine ectotherms including fish, environmental temperature has the pervasive effects on physiological and biochemical functions at all levels of biological organization, from molecule to organism (Jobling [1995]; Hochachka and Somero [2002]; Hofmann et al. [2002]; Donaldson et al. [2008]). According to the tolerance range of temperature, the fishes can be classified into two groups, <b>eurythermal</b> and stenothermal <b>species.</b> <b>Eurythermal</b> fish can maintain metabolic activity at temperatures as low as Antarctic fish can survive and withstand temperature as high as the avian and mammalian body temperature. In contrast, changes in environmental temperature may lead to the poor maintenance of physiological homeostasis in stenothermal species, resulting in temperature stress (Hochachka and Somero [2002]; Somero [2010]; Long et al.

40|$|Fish play a {{key role}} in the trophic {{dynamics}} of lakes. With climate warming, complex changes in fish assemblage structure may be expected owing to direct effects of temperature and indirect effects operating through eutrophication, water level changes, stratification and salinisation.

Along with an annual temperature increase of about 0. 15 – 0. 3 °C per decade profound changes have occurred in either fish assemblage composition, body size and/or age structure during recent decades and a shift towards higher dominance of <b>eurythermal</b> <b>species.</b> These shifts have occurred despite a reduction in nutrient loading in many of the lakes that should have benefited the larger-sized individuals and the fish species typically inhabiting cold-water, low-nutrient lakes. The cold-stenothermic Arctic charr has been particularly affected and its abundance has decreased in the majority of the lakes where its presence was recorded. The harvest of cool-stenothermal brown trout has decreased substantially in two southern lakes. Vendace, whitefish and smelt show a different response depending on lake depth and latitude. Perch has apparently been stimulated in the north, with stronger year classes in warm years, but its abundance has declined in the southern Lake Maggiore, Italy. Where introduced, roach seems to take advantage of the higher temperature after years of low population densities. <b>Eurythermal</b> <b>species</b> such as common bream, pike–perch and/or shad are apparently on the increase in several of the lakes. The response of fish to the warming has been surprisingly strong and fast in recent decades, making them ideal sentinels for detecting and documenting climate-induced modifications of freshwater ecosystems. ...|$|E

40|$|Temperature {{requirements}} for growth, photosynthesis and dark respiration were determined for five Antarctic red algal species. After acclimation, the stenothermal species Gigartina skottsbergii and Ballia callitricha grew at 0 {{or up to}} 5 degrees C, respectively; the <b>eurythermal</b> <b>species</b> Kallymenia antarctica, Gymnogongrus antarcticus and Phyllophora ahnfeltioides grew up to 10 degrees C. The temperature optima of photosynthesis were between 10 and 15 degrees C in the stenothermal species and between 15 and 25 degrees C in the <b>eurythermal</b> <b>species,</b> irrespective of the growth temperature. This shows that the temperature optima for photosynthesis are located well below the optima from species of other biogeographical regions, even from the Arctic. Respiratory rates rose with increasing temperatures. In contrast to photosynthesis, no temperature optimum was evident between 0 and 25 degrees C. Partial acclimation of photosynthetic capacity to growth temperature was found in two species. B. callitricha and Gymnogongrus antarcticus acclimate to 0 degrees C, and 5 and 0 degrees C, respectively. But acclimation did in no case lead to an overall shift in the temperature optimum of photosynthesis. B. callitricha and Gymnogongrus antarcticus showed acclimation of respiration to 5 degrees C, and P. ahnfeltioides to 5 and 10 degrees C, resulting in a temperature independence of respiration when measured at growth temperature. With respect to the acclimation potential of the species, no distinction can be made between the stenothermal versus the eurythermal group. (Net) photosynthetic capacity:respiration (P:R) ratios showed in all species highest values at 0 degrees C and decreased continuously to values lower than 1. 0 at 25 degrees C. In turn, the low P:R ratios at higher temperatures are assumed to determine the upper temperature growth limit of the studied species.

40|$|Heat {{tolerance}} in aquatic ectotherms is {{constrained by}} a mismatch, occurring at high temperatures, between oxygen delivery and demand which compromises {{the maintenance of}} aerobic scope. The present study analyses how the wide thermal tolerance range of an <b>eurythermal</b> model <b>species,</b> the green crab Carcinus maenas is supported and limited by its ability to sustain efficient oxygen transport to tissues. Similar to other eurytherms, C. maenas sustains naturally occurring acute warming events through the integrated response of circulatory and respiratory systems. The response of C. maenas to warming is characterized by two phases. During initial warming, oxygen consumption and heart rate increase while stroke volume and haemolymph oxygen partial pressures decrease. During further warming, dissolved oxygen levels in the venous compartment decrease below the threshold of full haemocyanin oxygen saturation. The progressive release of haemocyanin bound oxygen with further warming follows an exponential pattern, thereby saving energy in oxygen transport and causing an associated leveling off of metabolic rate. According {{to the concept of}} oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance, this indicates that the thermal tolerance window is widened by the increasing contribution of haemocyanin oxygen transport and associated energy savings in cardiocirculation. Haemocyanin bound oxygen sustains cardiac performance to cover the temperature range experienced by C. maenas in the field.

40|$|The body {{temperature}} of most fish species closely parallels {{that of their}} environment. While some species live at a relatively constant temperature, for example those in the deep sea or polar oceans, many experience marked changes in temperature sufficient to produce major changes in their physiological and biochemical rate processes {{as well as in}} their behaviour. Three major time courses of thermal adaptation have been distinguished: immediate, with a time scale of minutes or hours; seasonal, requiring several weeks or months; and evolutionary, involving changes at the level of genetic diversity (Hazel and Prosser, 1974). The changes in phenotype induced by seasonal temperature change have been extensively studied in <b>eurythermal</b> temperate <b>species</b> such as carp Cyprinus carpio and goldfish Carassius auratus. One of the best examples of a trait that changes in an acclimation-temperature-dependent manner {{at the level of the}} whole animal is the maximum cruising speed. Goldfish acclimated to different experimental temperatures show unique temperature/performance curves (Fry and Hart, 1948). In general, swimming speed increases at low temperatures and decreases at high temperatures following cold-acclimation. The opposite responses are observed following acclimation to warm temperatures. The mechanisms underlying such changes in swimming performance have been shown to involve adaptations in the activity and thermostability of myofibrillar ATPase (Johnston et al., 1975) as well as alterations in force production and maximum contraction speed of isolated muscle fibres (Johnston et al., 1985). It has been reported that changes in myofibrillar ATPase activity following temperature transfer are apparent for carp after 1 or 2 weeks (Heap et al., 1985). However, a steady state is achieved after 4 or 5 weeks, but not in starved individuals, suggesting that protein synthesis or the turnover of myofibrillar component(s) is involved in the response...|$|R

Based on the species richness recorded in 109 waterbodies scattered all across Switzerland, a model is presented here relating the local species richness (adult dragonflies) to environmental variables, including the mean annual air temperature. This model predicts a sharp increase in species richness for alpine or subalpine waterbodies, which is expected to double or even treble before the end of this century.

To investigate whether uncoupling proteins are involved in thermal adaptation of ectothermal animals, we isolated and characterised the entire genes of UCP- 2 for two closely related zoarcid fish species from Antarctic (Pachycara brachycephalum) and boreal (Zoarces viviparus) waters. Identical RNA probes were developed for both species to compare UCP- 2 expression levels at different acclimation temperatures as well as between the two fish species.

40|$|The {{degree to}} which {{temperature}} acclimation modifies the acute synthesis of the entire heat-shock protein (Hsp) complement is still unknown, but it may constitute an important mechanism for understanding the differences in acclimation ability among closely related ectothermic species that occupy widely varying thermal environments. In general, <b>eurythermal</b> (heat-tolerant) <b>species</b> modify physiological function {{in response to an}} increase in acclimation temperature {{to a greater extent than}} stenothermal (heat-sensitive) species. In the present work I used 35 S-labelled amino acids and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to test this assumption for how acclimation affects acute Hsp expression (referred to as phenotypic plasticity) in two heat-sensitive, low-intertidal to subtidal zone turban snails, Tegula brunnea and T. montereyi, in comparison to a heat-tolerant, mid- to low-intertidal zone congener, T. funebralis. I was able (i) to detect thesynthesis of over 30 proteins in gill tissue, primarily in the 70 ·kDa range, in response to an increase in temperature (13 °C, 24 °C, 27 °C and 30 °C), (ii) to assess the effect of acclimation (13 °C vs 22 °C) on acute Hsp synthesis, and (iii) to compare this effect among the three Tegula congeners. After increasing acclimation temperature from 13 °C to 22 °C, synthesis of the most highly expressed Hsps decreased more in T. brunnea and T. montereyi than in T. funebralis. Two highly expressed proteins of molecular mass 71 and 74 ·kDa, however, were also synthesized constitutively at 13 °C and changed with increasing acclimation temperature in all three species. Although similar in phenotypic plasticity, T. brunnea and T. montereyi synthesized either a 76 or a 72 kDa cluster of proteins, respectively, and differed in how acclimation affected the acute synthesis of several 77 kDa proteins. Thus, in Tegula, the effect of acclimation on Hsp expression is (i) Hsp-specific, (ii) dependent on a protein’s expression pattern (constitutive and inducible vs only inducible), (iii) and is actually limited in the more eurythermal mid- to low-intertidal congener. These results contradict the general assumption that greater heat tolerance correlates with an increased ability to modify physiological function in response to acclimation...|$|R

This small (about 0. 7 mm), ancient, obligate parthenogenetic species {{appeared to be}} particulary difficult to handle as its long life cycle (up to 3 - 4 years) has made lab experiments over several generations very difficult. D. stevensoni is an <b>eurythermal</b> and euryhaline <b>species</b> with low variability in size and shape (both of the carapace and the soft parts). Its genetic variability has also {{been found to be}} very low. Survival, clutch size, deposition timing and hatching were evaluated in acclimated and non-acclimated females from seven populations: six from Northern Italy and one from Spain. The samples were collected from three different habitats: four lakes, two streams and one spring. A genetic survey using starch gel electrophoresis had previously revealed that only Glucose phosphate isomerase (Gpi) locus was polymorphic. A clone, homozygous at Gpi locus, is the most common in lacustrine and spring habitats in the whole biogeographic range. Surprisingly, two heterozygous clones dominate in Northern Italian lotic environments. Enzymatic activity of heterozygous and homozygous genotypes at Gpi locus was assayed in order to evaluate the relationship between Gpi activity and fitness. Survival and developmental time were not affected by acclimation, while reproductive potential decreased in acclimated females. In females from running waters, reproduction started later and lasted for a shorter time, clutch size was smaller, and hatching percentage lower than females from lakes. These differences are not directly correlated with differences in enzymatic activities at Gpi locus. This does not rule out an overall genetic control of these characteristics since, in a parthenogenetic species, the whole genome is transmitted without recombination. We stress the intriguing case of D. stevensoni in relation to the concept of the "general purpose genotype"...|$|R

According to various assumptions, coastal species are either {{considered to be}} highly tolerant to environmental changes or, conversely, living at the thresholds of their physiological performance. Therefore, these species are either more resistant or more sensitive, respectively, to ocean acidification and warming. Here, we focused on Crepidula fornicata, an invasive gastropod that colonized bays and estuaries on northwestern European coasts during the 20 th century. Small (4. 5 cm in length), sexually mature individuals of C. fornicata were raised for 6 months in three different pCO 2 conditions (390 μatm, 750 μatm, and 1400 μatm) at four successive temperature levels (10 °C, 13 °C, 16 °C, and 19 °C). At each temperature level and in each pCO 2 condition, we assessed the physiological rates of respiration, ammonia excretion, filtration and calcification on small and large individuals. Results show that, in general, temperature positively influenced respiration, excretion and filtration rates in both small and large individuals. Conversely, increasing pCO 2 negatively affected calcification rates, leading to net dissolution in the most drastic pCO 2 condition (1400 μatm) but {{did not affect the}} other physiological rates.

30|$|Finally, in {{agreement}} with De los Ríos Escalante and Gajardo (2010) we consider that an increase in investigations on the zooplankton in South-American saline lakes, such as the Llancanelo-wetlands system, is urgently necessary {{in view of the}} current ongoing global climate change. According to Strecker et al. (2004) and Sommer et al. (2012), warmer temperatures could negatively affect zooplankton structure, especially in unproductive ecosystems, because of the influence of strong synergistic interactions between thermal stress and food limitation on the growth and reproduction of mainly the cladocerans. Within this scenario, <b>eurythermal</b> <b>species</b> such as certain rotifers and copepods could prevail in the absence of competition for food (Wagner and Adrian 2011). In the Llancanelo-wetland system, certain Brachionus species and cyclopoid copepods could possibly expand their predominance spatially and temporally under such conditions. As has been indicated in other aquatic ecosystems in the world (Brucet et al. 2009 a, b), global warming will possibly also effect an increase in the salinity of the springs and the lotic environments within the Llancanelo basin so as to cause losses in zooplankton biodiversity {{as a result of the}} consequent reduction in the viability and longevity of the egg banks of certain freshwater species within the sediments (Nielsen et al. 2003; Nielsen and Brock 2009), thus promoting the replacement of those species by euryhaline and eurythermal biota (Toruan 2012) having preferences for high temperatures and salinity—i.e., certain species of Brachionus or B. poopoensis (De los Ríos and Crespo 2004; De los Ríos 2005).|$|E

The relative proportions of energy allocated to protein and RNA/DNA synthesis, ion regulation and ATP synthesis were quantified between 0 and 15 °C by analysis of inhibitor sensitive cellular respiration. In all investigated species, protein synthesis constituted 25 - 37 %, RNA synthesis 24 - 35 %, Na+/K+-ATPase 40 - 45 % and mitochondrial ATP synthesis 57 - 65 % of total respiration. The sub-Antarctic nototheniid Lepidonotothen larseni displayed lower cellular protein synthesis rates but somewhat higher active ion regulation activities than its high-Antarctic confamilials, as is typical for more <b>eurythermal</b> <b>species.</b> Assumed thermal optima were mirrored in minimized overall cellular energy demand. Onset of thermal stress indicated by elevated energy turnover became visible between 3 and 0 °C as well as beyond 6 °C in the sub-Antarctic L. larseni and P. brachycephalum; whereas the high-Antarctic species displayed progressively rising respiration rates during warming with a cellular energetic minimum at 0 °C. Sub-Antarctic fish showed signs of cold-eurythermy and appear to live close to their lower limit of thermal tolerance, while high-Antarctic notothenioids show high degrees of energetic efficiency at 0 °C.

40|$|Polar marine {{invertebrates}} and fish grow slowly. At present {{there are three}} basic explanations for this slow growth: 1. a direct limitation by temperature, 2. rising costs of maintenance {{at the expense of}} a reduction in growth, 3. seasonal resource limitation. On the cellular level the rate-limiting effect of temperature on growth could be excluded for the cold stenothermal scallop Adamussium colbecki and for the Antarctic eelpout Pachycara brachycephalum. The protein synthesis, measured in vitro, was cold compensated in these species compared to related <b>eurythermal</b> <b>species,</b> the European scallop Aequipecten opercularis and the North Sea eelpout Zoarces viviparus. Within the temperature tolerance of P. brachycephalum the cold adapted protein synthesis apparatus could still be acclimated to various temperatures. Compensated protein synthesis capacities in Antarctic scallops and eelpout have been achieved by low activation energies and high RNA translation capacities and indicate the development of a cost efficient growth apparatus. Unlike Antarctic fish, Antarctic invertebrates exhibit higher RNA contents when compared to related species from warmer waters. These over compensated protein synthesis capacities due to high RNA contents seem specific for Antarctic invertebrates and support high growth efficiencies during the austral summer. A comparison of in vivo and in vitro protein synthesis rates suggests that actual in vivo rates remain far below capacity. Therefore the regulation must occur on a higher level. A sensible regulation factor could be the pHi. Differing energy budgets and trade-offs between lifestyle, exercise and growth performance of cold stenothermal and eurythermal animals are discussed. A basic requirement is that the energetic costs for the protein synthesis are the same as demonstrated for both scallop species.

40|$|Temperature {{acclimation}} {{effects on}} leg muscle plasma membrane composition and biophysical state, neuromuscular function and whole organism thermal tolerance, and {{their dependence on}} the background seasonal acclimatization were investigated in the eurythermal Carcinus maenas and the stenothermal Cancer pagurus. Correlations between the changes observed at each of these levels are discussed. The average winter (5 ºC), annual (8 ºC), and summer (15 ºC) sea-water temperatures and a warmer summer temperature (22 ºC) were chosen as acclimation temperatures for their ecological significance. Warm-acclimation (22 ºC) increased the thermal tolerance (CTMax) of both species and induced partial compensation of the neuromuscular function (assessed from leg nerve axonal conduction velocity and the amplitudes of excitatory junction potentials in dactylopodite closer muscle fibres). The time-course of acclimation showed it was complete after two weeks, but a longer exposure to 22 ºC reduced neuromuscular performance, an effect {{that may not be}} acclimation related. At plasma membrane level, the response to warm-acclimation depended on acclimation temperature. Acclimation to 15 ºC induced {{a significant increase in the}} S/U fatty acids ratio of PC and PE, but no increase in plasma membrane order. Acclimation to 22 ºC induced a significant increase in the Ch/PL molar ratio and in plasma membrane order, but no major changes in overall fatty acid composition of membrane phospholipids, compared to cold-acclimated crabs. A seasonal background, determined by complex factors, underlined these responses to temperature-acclimation. At all acclimation temperatures, crabs acclimated in autumn and winter had lower S/U fatty acid ratios and Ch/PL molar ratios than in spring, and the temperature dependence of plasma membrane fluidity was reduced in summer, compared to spring and autumn. The response to 15 ºC- acclimation was greater in winter than in other seasons. The CTMax and the magnitude or efficacy of the acclimation responses showed that the stenothermal species was more thermally sensitive than the <b>eurythermal</b> <b>species...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: Many Antarctic notothenioid {{fish are}} {{considered}} losers of global change, {{due to their}} low thermal tolerance and lack of regulative mechanisms that enhance physiological plasticity. The Austral nototheniid congener Notothenia angustata provides an alternative model to explore the effects of ocean acidification and warming, as it inhabits cold temperate to subpolar waters. It is a <b>eurythermal</b> <b>species,</b> with greater capacities for thermal acclimation relative to Antarctic congeners, and therefore presents a useful model against which Antarctic notothenioids can be contrasted. Methods: We investigated {{the long-term effects of}} hypercarbic acclimation on whole animal and cardiac mitochondrial function for the Austral nototheniid Notothenia angustata. Fish were acclimated under hypercarbic (0. 2 kPa CO 2, 15 days, n= 6) and normocarbic conditions (control 0. 04 kPa CO 2, n= 10). Routine metabolic rates (RMR) were determined with acute increases in temperature (3 °C/d) under normocarbic and hypercarbic conditions. Mitochondrial function was then tested within permeabilised cardiac muscle fibres, and assays conducted in normocarbic (0. 04 kPa CO 2) and hypercarbic (3. 0 kPa CO 2) media at 9, 15 and 21 °C. Metabolic profiles were determined in red skeletal muscle. Findings: Whole animal critical temperature thresholds occurred below 19 °C for normocarbic exposed fish, while acutely hypercarbic exposed fish maintained routine metabolic rates up to 21 oC. Overall mitochondria mirrored the responses of acutely exposed whole animals, with an increased mitochondrial performance in fish acclimated to chronic hypercarbia. Chronically hypercarbic exposed animals also exhibited altered metabolomes of red muscle, but not liver with apparent increases in metabolites consistent with enhanced anaerobic metabolism and elevated contents of histidine and tryptophan that may contribute to acid-base buffering. Conclusions: Overall enhanced cardiac mitochondrial capacities coincide with increasing hypercarbic and elevated temperature tolerance. This response suggests sufficient metabolic plasticity for Austral nototheniids to acclimate to a warming and acidifying ocean, which has not been observed to that extent in Antarctic notothenioids. ...|$|E

Cladoceran remains including their species, amount richness and ecological features are analyzed {{for the top}} 117 cm sections of the core, upon which 5 cladoceran assemblages are distinguished. CLO is an assemblage without any cladocera in the depth between 117 - 105 cm. CM assemblage (depths between 101 - 77 cm, ca. 1407 - 1533 AD) possesses total 9 cladoceran species that appear in the core, and performs the greatest richness in the whole sequence. This assemblage reflected that {{there was plenty of}} exotic cold water and organic debrises inputing to the sedimentary site under the warmer conditions. The lake was wide and shallow that satisfied the big hydrophyte living. Cladoceran species and richnesses of CL 2 assemblage (depths between 77 - 29 cm, ca. 1533 - 1831 AD) perform much more decreasing than those of CL 1. There was only less Chydorus sphaeticus which was acclimatized to wide environmental ranges. This implied that the sedimentary environment is so execrable that most of cladoceran lost their living abilities. Compared with CM assemblage, CL 3 assemblage (depths between 29 - 10 cm, ca. 1831 - 1941 AD) possesses nearly the same dominant species but lower richnesses. Especially, the cladoceran preferring organic debris also decrease in their amounts. This meant that the surface vegetation in the drainage basin was still poor though the environment turned to be better. Except the 2 zooplankton species, the other 7 species of cladoceran in this core are found in CL 4 assemblage (depths between 100 cm, ca. 1941 - 1998 AD), in which the <b>eurythermal</b> <b>species</b> had not performed their competition ability comparing with narrow-temperatures adapted species. It implied that water temperatures were stable and much more influenced by air temperatures under the shallow-water conditions. The environmental features reflected by cladocera assemblages of CC 2 core are fully supported by the evidences from ostra-coda assemblages, diatom-salinity transfunction, environmental magnetism and relative proxies of the parallel CC 1 core. Cladoceran assemblages in the lake sediments of Tibetan Plateau are sensitive to sedimentary environment and very significant to the studies of environmental changes...|$|E

All groups were sampled at 03 : 00, 09 : 00, 15 : 00 and 21 : 00 hr. Hemoglobin content and packed cell volume, as well as electrolyte and 'water levels were determined for each animal and red cell ion concentrations and ion : hemoglobin ratios estimated. Cycled animals were distinct from those at constant temperatures in several respects. Hematological parameters were elevated above those of animals at constant temperature and were, on a diurnal basis, more stable. Red blood cell electrolyte levels varied in an adaptively appropriate fashion to cycle temperatures. This {{was not the case}} in the constant temperature groups_ Under the cycling regime, plasma ion levels were more diurnally stable than those of constant temperature fish. Although muscle parameters in cycled fish exhibited more fluctuation than was observed in plasma, these also tended to be relatively more stable than was the caseErythrocytic data are discussed in terms of their effects on hemoglobin-oxygen affinity while plasma and muscle observations were considered from the standpoint of overall water-electrolyte balance. In general, cycled fish appeared to be capable of stabilizing overall body fluid composition, while simultaneously effecting adaptively-appropriate modifications in the erythrocytic ionic microenvironment of hemoglobin. The sometimes marked diurnal variability of water-electrolyte status in animals held at constant temperature as opposed to the conservation of cycled fish suggests that this species is, in some fashion, programmed for regulation in a thermally-fluctuating environment. If this interpretation is valid and a phenomenon of general occurrence, some earlier studies involving constant acclimation of <b>eurythermal</b> <b>species</b> normally occupying habitats which vary in temperature on a daily basis may require reconsideration. at constant temperature...|$|E
40|$|Effects {{of global}} warming on animal {{distribution}} and performance become visible in many marine ecosystems. The present {{study was designed to}} develop a concept for a cause and effect understanding with respect to temperature changes and to explain ecological findings based on physiological processes. The concept is based on a wide comparison of invertebrate and fish species with a special focus on recent data obtained in two model species of fish. These fish species are both characterized by northern and southern distribution limits in the North Atlantic: eelpout (Zoarces viviparus), as a typical non-migrating inhabitant of the coastal zone and the cod (Gadus morhua), as a typical inhabitant of the continental shelf with a high importance for fisheries. Mathematical modelling demonstrates a clear significant correlation between climate induced temperature fluctuations and the recruitment of cod stocks. Growth performance in cod is optimal at temperatures close to 10 °C, regardless of the population investigated in a latitudinal cline. However, temperature specific growth rates decrease at higher latitudes. Also, fecundity is less in White Sea than in North and Baltic Sea cod or eelpout populations. These findings suggest that a cold-induced shift in energy budget occurs which is unfavorable for growth performance and fecundity. Thermal tolerance limits shift depending on latitude and are characterized by oxygen limitation at both low or high temperatures. Oxygen supply to tissues is optimized at low temperature by a shift in hemoglobin isoforms and oxygen binding properties to lower affinities and higher unloading potential. Protective stimulation of heat shock protein synthesis was not observed. According to a recent model of thermal tolerance the downward shift of tolerance limits during cold adaptation is associated with rising mitochondrial densities and, thus, aerobic capacity and performance in the cold. especially in <b>eurythermal</b> <b>species.</b> At the same time the costs of mitochondrial maintenance reflected by mitochondrial proton leakage should rise leaving a lower energy fraction for growth and reproduction. The preliminary conclusion can be drawn that warming will cause a northern shift of distribution limits for both species with a rise in growth performance and fecundity larger than expected from the Q 10 effect in the north and lower growth or even extinction of the species in the south. Such a shift may heavily affect fishing activities in the North Sea...|$|E
40|$|Studien belegen den Einfluss der Umgebungstemperatur auf die physiologischen Prozesse im Körper von ektothermen Tieren. In der aktuellen Studie wurde der Einfluss der Außentemperatur auf das Hörvermögen von ektothermen Otophysen untersucht. Hierfür wurden der Karpfen Cyprinus carpio (Familie Cyprinidae) und der Welse Silurus glanis (Familie Siluridae) herangezogen. Die Versuchstiere wurden {{mindestens}} drei Wochen auf die zu testenden Temperaturen akklimatisiert. Zuerst wurden sie auf 15 °C akklimiert, dann auf 25 °C und anschließend wieder auf 15 °C zurückakklimiert. Mittels der Ableitung Auditorisch Evozierter Potentiale (AEP – Methode) wurde die Hörempfindlichkeit bei insgesamt sieben verschiedenen Frequenzen zwischen 100 bis 4000 Hz getestet. Weiters wurden die Latenzen der Antwort als Verzögerungen auf einen Klick-Stimulus gemessen. Die Latenz wurde als die Zeit definiert, welche zwischen dem Einsetzen des Klick-Stimulus und der ersten konstanten und höchsten Spitze des AEP (P 2) registriert wurde. P 2 zeigte sich als eindeutige Antworten auf den Klick-Stimulus in allen Temperaturen. Bei der höheren Temperatur verbesserte sich das Hörvermögen bei den Karpfen zwischen 300 und 2000 Hz und bei den Welsen zwischen 300 und 4000 Hz. Die P 2 -Latenzen der AEPs nahmen bei 25 °C im Vergleich zu 15 °C bei beiden Arten um 0. 37 ms ab. Diese Daten lassen erkennen, dass die Hörempfindlichkeit mit zunehmender Temperatur bei eurythermen Otophysen steigt. : Ectothermic animals, such as fish, {{are affected}} by ambient water temperature. Their body temperature depends on environmental heat sources, which influence the physiological and metabolic processes, including sensory systems such as the auditory system. In this study I investigated how the ambient water temperature affects the auditory system in two eurythermal otophysan fish species representing two different orders. Methodology/Principal Findings: In order to investigate possible effects of temperature on the auditory sensitivity I utilized the auditory evoked potentials (AEP) recording technique. Auditory sensitivity and temporal resolution were measured in the common carp Cyprinus carpio (order Cypriniformes) and the Wels catfish Silurus glanis (order Siluriformes) after acclimating fish {{for at least three}} weeks to two different water temperatures (15 °C, 25 °C and again 15 °C). Hearing sensitivity increased with temperature in both species. In C. carpio best hearing was detected at 1 kHz at both temperatures and the maximum increase was found at 0. 8 kHz (7. 8 dB). S. glanis showed highest sensitivity between 0. 5 – 1 kHz and largest increase at 0. 5 kHz (10. 3 dB). The improvement in hearing abilities differed between species in particular at 4 kHz. The temporal resolution was measured by determining the latency in response to single clicks from the onset of the sound stimulus to the highest positive peak of the AEP. The latency decreased at the higher temperature in both species by 0. 37 ms on average. Conclusions/Significance: The current study showed that an increase in temperature results in an improvement of hearing (lower thresholds, shorter latencies) in <b>eurythermal</b> <b>species</b> representing different orders of otophysines. The increase in sensitivity seems to be more pronounced in eurythermal than stenothermal (tropical) species. ...|$|E
40|$|Evolutionary {{adaptation}} and the connected acclimation capacity of species to changing environmental conditions {{represents one of}} the key factors in the composition and dynamics of any ecosystem. In marine environments temperature {{is one of the major}} factors defining the aquatic fauna. In respect to progressing climate change the question arises how individual species react to higher temperatures and how this affects the entire ecosystem. Species that are highly specialized on stable environmental conditions seem to be especially vulnerable. This thesis characterizes the Antarctic eelpout Pachycara brachycephalum (Pappenheim, 1912) in regards to its adaptation to low habitat temperatures as well as its capacity to acclimate to higher temperatures at the molecular level. A cDNA library was established and subjected to high-throughput sequencing to provide a basis for sequence analyses. To characterize differences between a cold-adapted and a <b>eurythermal</b> <b>species,</b> an already existing cDNA library of the closely related congener Zoarces viviparus (Linnaeus, 1758) was included in large-scale comparisons. The repertoire of functional genes reflected cold-adaptation features of cellular metabolism in P. brachycephalum, e. g. through a higher ratio of ubiquitin–related genes. These genes are of great importance in cold-{{adaptation and}} counter the cold denaturation of proteins. Furthermore, the amino acid sequences of orthologous proteins displayed differences between the eury- and the stenotherm. The observed position-specific interchanges in P. brachycephalum highly conform with the flexibility hypothesis. According to this hypothesis a protein may be destabilized in its three-dimensional structure by minimal changes within the amino acid sequence. This destabilization sustains reaction kinetics in the cold. In addition, differences were noted in the encoding of amino acids at DNA level. Within homologous proteins of P. brachycephalum amino acids are encoded with a preference for AT-richer triplets on the third codon position. This trend promotes less stable transitional states at this level, too, as the base pairing of AT is less stable than that of GC. This may facilitate transcription and translation in the cold and thus constitute an adaptation to the habitat conditions of the Antarctic eelpout. For studying the plasticity of this species in more detail, various acclimation experiments were conducted. At first, the chronology of warm acclimation was established by means of enzyme measurements as well as through expression analyses of various candidate genes. Through this the mechanisms that account for metabolic changes in the warmth could be identified at the protein as well as the transcriptomic level. The observed shift from lipid-based to carbohydrate-based metabolism provided evidence that the Antarctic eelpout prepares for hypoxemic conditions. The shift to carbohydrate-fuels is advantageous under anaerobic conditions, which may be elicited by warmer temperatures, due to elevated oxygen demand insufficiently met by the limited capacity of the circulation/respiration system. Various transcriptomic factors of the PPAR family were identified as important mediators of the metabolic shift. These nuclear–located receptors „measure“ the energy status within a cell and regulate the expression of various genes involved in lipid- and carbohydrate metabolism. The expression profiles of all 26 genes examined, provided an acclimation time course that can be divided into 3 phases: acute, mid-term and long-term. Another experiment was dedicated to the compilation of expression profiles of long-term acclimated specimens held at 6 different temperatures ranging from - 1 to 9 °C over a time period of 2 months. A total of 664 temperature-sensitive transcript sequences could be identified by using a custom microarray design based on the sequence information of the cDNA library. The growth optimum of the Antarctic eelpout was characterized by the smallest transcriptomic changes, i. e. the least regulatory effort. The differently expressed functions revealed specific patterns for the temperature ranges „cold“, „intermediate“ and „warm“, with specific features in energy metabolism. Again, the aforementioned metabolic shift could be observed, with additional indicators for a potential use of amino acids as an energy reserve in the cold. Further differences between acclimation temperatures in processes like transcription, translation, protein degradation or the organization of the cytoskeleton are discussed with respect to their implications for metabolic energy consumption. Furthermore, regulatory mechanisms increasing the proliferation of blood vessels that obviously modify the cardio-vascular system to counter an oxygen limitation have been identified in the warmth. Beyond an acclimation temperature of 6 °C an extreme energy deficit is indicated by a severe weight loss of the specimen. This was accompanied by a classic cellular stress response, signifying an essential threshold temperature of the thermal window of P. brachycephalum. Overall, by combining various experimental approaches covering the entire thermal tolerance window and beyond, the correlation between the molecular and the whole animal level was established. The Antarctic eelpout displays capacities to acclimate to temperatures above the range of habitat temperatures. This thesis highlights the complexity of molecular adaptation at DNA, RNA and protein levels as well as various functional shifts in metabolism enabling life at various acclimation temperatures. The present findings help to substantiate the framework of the oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance at the molecular level. ...|$|E
