5000|$|Occasionally, a {{so-called}} [...] "graft hybrid" [...] or more accurately graft chimera can occur where the tissues {{of the stock}} continue to grow within the scion. Such a plant can produce flowers and foliage typical of both plants as well as shoots intermediate between the two. The best-known example this is probably +Laburnocytisus 'Adamii', a <b>graft</b> <b>hybrid</b> between laburnum and broom, which originated in a nursery near Paris, France in 1825. This small tree bears yellow flowers typical of Laburnum anagyroides, purple flowers typical of Chamaecytisus purpureus and curious coppery-pink flowers that show characteristics of both [...] "parents". Many species of cactus can also produce graft chimeras under the right conditions although they are often created unintentionally and such results are often hard to replicate.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Grafting {{has been}} {{extensively}} used to enhance the performance of horticultural crops. Since Charles Darwin coined the term "graft hybrid" meaning that asexual combination of different plant species may generate products that are genetically distinct, highly discrepant opinions exist supporting or against the concept. Recent studies have documented that grafting enables exchanges of both RNA and DNA molecules between the grafting partners, thus providing a molecular basis for grafting-induced genetic variation. DNA methylation is known as prone to alterations {{as a result of}} perturbation of internal and external conditions. Given characteristics of grafting, it is interesting to test whether the process may cause an alteration of this epigenetic marker in the grafted organismal products. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed relative global DNA methylation levels and locus-specific methylation patterns by the MSAP marker and locus-specific bisulfite-sequencing in the seed plants (wild-type controls), self- and hetero-grafted scions/rootstocks, selfed progenies of scions and their seed-plant controls, involving three Solanaceae species. We quantified expression of putative genes involved in establishing and/or maintaining DNA methylation by q-(RT) -PCR. We found that (1) hetero-grafting caused extensive alteration of DNA methylation patterns in a locus-specific manner, especially in scions, although relative methylation levels remain largely unaltered; (2) the altered methylation patterns in the hetero-grafting-derived scions could be inherited to sexual progenies with some sites showing further alterations or revisions; (3) hetero-grafting caused dynamic changes in steady-state transcript abundance of genes encoding for a set of enzymes functionally relevant to DNA methylation. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate that inter-species grafting in plants could produce extensive and heritable alterations in DNA methylation. We suggest that these readily altered, yet heritable, epigenetic modifications due to interspecies hetero-grafting may shed one facet of insight into the molecular underpinnings for the still contentious concept of <b>graft</b> <b>hybrid...</b>|$|E
40|$|The modern Biotech Age {{possesses}} a very {{particular set of}} characteristics: the use of recombinant DNA technology, a close relationship between academic science and industry and, in Britain, public hostility to genetically modified crops. Yet despite increasingly widespread recognition among historians of science that biotechnology has a long and multi-faceted history, there is no thorough account {{of the history of}} plant biotechnology in British agriculture. Harnessing previously unexamined archival sources at the National Institute of Agricultural Botany (NIAB), John Innes Centre (JIC) and the Science Museum, this thesis uncovers a number of largely unexamined plant biotechnologies and discusses their uptake in British agriculture since the mid-twentieth century. In doing so, it raises several new insights for historians. Chapters One and Two demonstrate how two commercially successful biotechnologies, industrial hybridization and mutation breeding, found agricultural applications by careful integration with existing industrial systems. Chapter Three shows how plant cell fusion became a genuine alternative to recombinant DNA technology during the 1960 s and ‘ 70 s. Chapter Four counters the standard narrative of a move from the morphological to the molecular in biological analysis with a case study of electrophoresis and other classificatory technologies. Chapter Five demonstrates the importance of Cold War ideology on the development of biotechnology with a case study of the <b>graft</b> <b>hybrid</b> in British horticulture. Finally, Chapter Six examines the GM controversy in Britain and considers what broader lessons about public attitudes to biotechnology can be taken from the debate. Taken together, this thesis demonstrates that a unique combination of plant biotechnologies emerged in mid-twentieth-century Britain. These biotechnologies succeeded or failed to influence British agriculture thanks to a combination of technological, economic and ideological factors. The Biotech Age could, at many points since 1950, have emerged in a very different way with very different characteristics...|$|E

VGF and progression of native coronary artery disease limit the long-term efficacy of {{coronary artery bypass graft}} surgery. We reviewed the published literature on the pathophysiology, prevention, and/or treatment of VGF by searching the MEDLINE (January 1, 1966 -January 1, 2012), EMBASE (January 1, 1980 -January 1, 2012), and Cochrane (January 1, 1995 -January 1, 2012) databases. In addition, we reviewed references from the selected articles for studies not identified in the initial search. Basic science and clinical studies were included; non-English language publications were excluded. Acute thrombosis, neointimal hyperplasia, and accelerated atherosclerosis are the 3 mechanisms that lead to VGF. Preventive measures include matching and quality assessment of conduit and target vessel, lipid-lowering drugs, antithrombotic therapy, and cessation of smoking. Treatment of VGF includes medical therapy, percutaneous intervention, and redo coronary artery bypass graft surgery. In patients undergoing graft intervention, the use of drug-eluting stents, antiplatelet agents, and embolic protection devices may improve clinical outcomes.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of grafting on the control of gummy stem blight in four muskmelon hybrids. The hybrids Bonus II, Sunrise, Louis and Prince hakusho were grafted onto the squash hybrid Shelper, which is immune to D. bryoniae. Two experiments were conducted, one in greenhouse with artificial inoculation of the pathogen and the other in protected environment using crop residues and soil infected with the pathogen. Under greenhouse conditions, mycelial discs of the pathogen were inoculated onto the hypocotyl or at the union graft/rootstock region of the grafted plants and onto ungrafted plants of each hybrid. By growing these four melon hybrids in a protected environment, the effect of grafting on the control of gummy stem blight could be studied. When these melons were grown in the greenhouse or in a protected environment, grafting significantly reduced the growth of gummy stem blight in all four melon <b>hybrids.</b> For <b>grafted</b> <b>hybrid</b> plants inoculated at the hypocotyl, the disease severity decreased by 34. 1 %, 33. 8 %, 51. 1 % and 48. 0 % for Sunrise, Bonus II, Louis and Prince hakusho, respectively, compared to ungrafted plants.

The risk factors and impacts of acute kidney injury (AKI) after percutaneous TEVAR, however, have not been widely established. Methods: We retrospectively studied the clinical records of 305 consecutive patients who admitted to our institution and had TEVAR for TBAD between December 2009 and June 2013. The patients were routinely monitored for their renal functions preoperatively until 7 days after TEVAR. The Kidney Disease Improving Global Guidelines (KDIGO) criteria were used for AKI. Results: Of the total 305 consecutive patients, 84 (27. 5 %) developed AKI after TEVAR, comprising 66 (21. 6 %) patients in KDIGO stage 1, 6 (2. 0 %) patients in stage 2 and 12 (3. 9 %) patients in stage 3. From the logistic regression analysis, systolic blood pressure (SBP) on admission > 140 mmHg (odds ratio [OR], 2. 288; 95 % CI, 1. 319 – 3. 969) and supra-aortic branches <b>graft</b> bypass <b>hybrid</b> surgery (OR, 3. 228; 95 % CI, 1. 526 – 6. 831) were independent risk factors for AKI after TEVAR. Local anesthesia tended to be a protective factor (OR, 0. 563; 95 % CI, 0. 316 – 1. 001). The preoperative renal function, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker or statin administration, volume of contrast agent, range of TBAD and false lumen involving renal artery were not associated with post-operation AKI. The in-hospital mortality and major adverse events were markedly increased with the occurrence of AKI (7. 1 % vs 0. 9 %, P= 0. 006; 14. 3 % vs 3. 2 %, P< 0. 001, respectively).

The stent graft was inserted with the distal landing zone at the level of vertebrae T 10 –T 12. All patients underwent computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiography before discharge; 8 patients underwent subsequent endovascular stent extension. ResultsThe 30 -day survival was 100 %, with 3. 1 % (1 / 32) overall mortality at 17 ± 4 months (range, 1 – 33) of follow-up. The postoperative complications included pneumonia in 5, pulmonary embolism in 3, sepsis in 1, and permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve damage in 1 patient. No ischemic brain or spinal cord injury occurred. During follow-up, no endoleaks or false lumen patency developed. ConclusionsSizing the stent <b>graft</b> of the <b>hybrid</b> prosthesis according to the total aortic diameter and choosing a distal landing zone between vertebrae T 10 and T 12 is safe, with low midterm mortality and morbidity. It allows an extensive repair of the dissected aorta with early definite occlusion of the false lumen and prepares for potential endovascular extension of the graft...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveTotal {{aortic arch}} {{replacement}} typically requires hypothermic circulatory arrest, carrying risks of cerebral ischemia. We recently introduced left carotid–subclavian bypass before total aortic arch replacement with thoracic stent <b>grafting</b> to achieve <b>hybrid</b> arch reconstruction with {{short periods of}} selective antegrade cerebral perfusion. MethodsFrom 2004 to 2009, 332 patients underwent ascending aorta or arch replacements. Of these, 37 underwent total aortic arch replacement. In 2008, we began performing left carotid–subclavian bypass before subtotal arch replacement, with side-graft anastomoses to innominate and left carotid arteries. Patients then underwent aortic graft stent deployment to complete arch reconstruction. Twenty-eight patients underwent conventional arch replacement (group I); 9 underwent hybrid arch replacement (group II). ResultsSelective antegrade cerebral perfusion time in group I was 33. 3 ± 13. 7 minutes versus 18. 9 ± 9. 2 minutes in group II (P =. 007). Among group I patients, 82 % required hypothermic circulatory arrest (vs 0 % in group II, P <. 001). Mean cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic crossclamp times were longer in group I than group II (P < . 05). Incidence of neurologic complications was 14 % in group I (4 / 28) versus 0 % (0 / 9) in group II, although this finding did not reach statistical significance (P =. 55). ConclusionsLeft carotid–subclavian bypass before arch replacement with staged thoracic stent <b>grafting</b> to achieve <b>hybrid</b> arch reconstruction was associated with decreased selective antegrade cerebral perfusion, cardiopulmonary bypass, and aortic crossclamp times and eliminated hypothermic circulatory arrest. This technique may minimize neurologic complications associated with arch replacement and provide a viable hybrid approach to patients with arch aneurysms and dissections...|$|R
40|$|A layered-structure <b>hybrid</b> {{vascular}} <b>graft,</b> {{mimicking the}} hierarchic {{structure of the}} intima and media of a natural artery, is expected to exhibit antithrombogenicity and to accelerate neoarterial tissue formation. Two models of <b>hybrid</b> vascular <b>grafts</b> were prepared on knitted Dacron fabric grafts (inner diameter 4 mm, length 6 cm). Model I grafts consisted of an endothelial cell monolayer formed on collagenous matrix, and model II grafts consisted of an endothelial cell monolayer that formed on hybrid collagenous medial tissue in which smooth muscle cells were incorporated. Both models (n = 17 for each model) were implanted bilaterally in carotid arteries and left in place for up to 26 weeks. Although all of the implanted grafts were patent, the two models significantly differed {{in the degree of}} maturity of the regenerated neoarterial wall especially at earlier implantation periods. At 2 weeks, model II grafts showed a much higher degree of neointimal integrity than model I grafts: a smooth and organized neointimal layer was formed, which was free from leukocyte adhesion. On further increase of implantation time, the formation of neomedia (subendothelial smooth muscle cell layers) and circumferential orientation of both smooth muscle cells and collagenous extracellular matrix were much more advanced in model II grafts than in model I grafts. At 26 weeks after implantation, layered elastic laminae regenerated along circumferentially oriented smooth muscle cells in neomedia were observed only in model II grafts. Irrespective of model, little excessive smooth muscle cell proliferaion occurred. A hierarchically structured <b>hybrid</b> <b>graft</b> eventually provided a more integrated neointimal layer and accelerated neoarterial tissue formation much more than model I grafts. The significance of the incorporation of smooth muscle cells into <b>hybrid</b> <b>grafts</b> is discussed...|$|R
