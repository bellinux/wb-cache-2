5|$|The mass {{influx of}} {{immigrants}} {{during this period}} were almost totally English and Welsh; the most notable exception being an immigrant nationality from outside the United Kingdom, the Italians. In the late 19th century a group of <b>Italian</b> <b>immigrants,</b> originally from the northern area of Italy, centred on the town of Bardi, were forced out of London by an over-saturation of the market. These immigrants set up a network of cafés, ice cream parlours and fish & chip shops throughout South Wales and these businesses became iconic landmarks in the villages they served and they and subsequent generations became Welsh Italians. Particular to the Rhondda, the shops ran by the <b>Italian</b> <b>immigrants,</b> were known as 'Bracchis', {{believed to have been}} named after Angelo Bracchi who opened the first café in the Rhondda in the early 1890s. By the early 21st century several of the original Bracchis were still open for business in the Rhondda.|$|E
5|$|Born in Naples, Italy, {{he came to}} the United States in 1895 {{with his}} parents at the age of nine. His father Francesco Cotillo, had been a caterer in Naples.

The family settled in East Harlem in East 113th Street among the increasing numbers of <b>Italian</b> <b>immigrants.</b> His father took up catering again and opened a popular pastry and confectionery shop. He has been credited with introducing the Italian ice cream spumoni into the United States.|$|E

5|$|Linguist Jesse Sheidlower {{traces the}} gesture's {{development}} in the United States to the 1890s. According to anthropologist Desmond Morris, the gesture probably came to the United States via <b>Italian</b> <b>immigrants.</b> The first documented appearance of the finger in the United States was in 1886, when Old Hoss Radbourn, a baseball pitcher for the Boston Beaneaters, was photographed giving it {{to a member of}} their rival the New York Giants. In the film Speedy (1928), Harold Lloyd's character gives himself the finger into a distorting mirror at Luna Park, about 24 minutes into the film.|$|E
5|$|Part of modern-day Route311 was {{originally}} the Philipstown Turnpike, a road built in 1815 {{to overcome a}} lack of transportation when the Hudson River froze during the winter months. The turnpike was a large business center for the county, though it was abandoned due to insufficient tolls to maintain it. Another section was constructed in the early 1900s, from the Patterson Baptist Church near the modern-day intersection of Route311 and Route164 to the Village of Patterson, {{by a group of}} <b>Italian</b> <b>immigrants.</b>|$|E

Later that year she was present for a ceremony in Capitán Pastene, Chile, a town founded by <b>Italian</b> <b>immigrants.</b> In January 1908, the Italian government sold Dogali to Uruguay. She was renamed 25 de Agosto for the date Uruguay declared its independence. At the time, she was the largest warship in the Uruguayan Navy. In 1910, the ship was renamed Montevideo after the country's capital city. She was decommissioned in 1914, but remained in the Uruguayan Navy's inventory until 1932, when the old cruiser was finally sold to be broken up.|$|E
5|$|The Little Italy {{neighborhood}} grew {{south of}} downtown, as many <b>Italian</b> <b>immigrants</b> {{came to the}} city to work in the Union Pacific shops. Scandinavians first came to Omaha as Mormon settlers in the Florence neighborhood. Czechs had a strong political and cultural voice in Omaha, and were involved in a variety of trades and businesses, including banks, wholesale houses, and funeral homes. The Notre Dame Academy and Convent and Czechoslovak Museum are legacies of their residence. Today the legacy of the city's early European immigrant populations is evident in many social and cultural institutions in Downtown and South Omaha.|$|E
5|$|West Utica (or the West Side) was {{historically}} home to German, Irish and Polish immigrants. The Corn Hill {{neighborhood in}} the city center had a significant Jewish population. East Utica (or the East Side) is a cultural and political center dominated by <b>Italian</b> <b>immigrants.</b> North of downtown is the Triangle neighborhood, home to the city's African American and Jewish populations. Neighborhoods formerly dominated {{by one or more}} groups saw other groups arrive, such as Bosnians and Latin Americans in former Italian neighborhoods and the Welsh in Corn Hill. Bagg Commemorative Park and Bagg's Square West (Utica's historic centers) are in the northeastern portion of downtown, with Genesee Street on the west and Oriskany Street on the south.|$|E

5|$|In the 1820s, Boston's {{population}} grew rapidly, and the city's ethnic composition changed dramatically {{with the first}} wave of European immigrants. Irish immigrants dominated {{the first wave of}} newcomers during this period, especially following the Irish Potato Famine; by 1850, about 35,000 Irish lived in Boston. In {{the latter half of the}} 19th century, the city saw increasing numbers of Irish, Germans, Lebanese, Syrians, French Canadians, and Russian and Polish Jews settling in the city. By the end of the 19th century, Boston's core neighborhoods had become enclaves of ethnically distinct immigrants. Italians inhabited the North End, Irish dominated South Boston and Charlestown, and Russian Jews lived in the West End. Irish and <b>Italian</b> <b>immigrants</b> brought with them Roman Catholicism. Currently, Catholics make up Boston's largest religious community, and the Irish have played a major role in Boston politics since the early 20th century; prominent figures include the Kennedys, Tip O'Neill, and John F. Fitzgerald.|$|E

25|$|Italian-American food {{is based}} {{primarily}} on the culinary traditions of Southern <b>Italian</b> <b>immigrants,</b> although {{a significant number of}} Northern <b>Italian</b> <b>immigrants</b> also came to the United States and also influenced this style of cuisine to some extent, most of whom arrived in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. During this time, many Italians came from Naples and Sicily and moved to large American cities, such as New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, Boston and San Francisco; the immigrant cuisine is thus largely derived from Neapolitan and Sicilian cuisine, and is particularly associated with these cities.|$|E
