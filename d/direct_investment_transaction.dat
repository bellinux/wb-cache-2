40|$|The {{assumption}} in {{the theory}} of international production is that direct foreign investment offers the best alternative for exercising effective control over foreign operations. This is based on the belief that, by externalising company-specific advantages, firms will be unable to efficiently constrain the behaviour of the other parties, and will therefore incur high transaction costs. This paper argues that the costs of overseas operation may be higher in direct foreign investment than in franchising and that the latter is a form of organisation in which arms-length associates can be effectively monitored and controlled without the need for substantial <b>direct</b> <b>investment.</b> <b>transaction</b> costs and business franchising...|$|E
40|$|The {{rapid rise}} in Japanese owned {{assets in the}} United States and the {{substantial}} fall of the dollar against the yen naturally {{raises the question of}} whether there is a causal relationship between Japanese <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> and the yen/dollar exchange rate.; This paper contributes in two ways to the analysis of the direct investment-exchange rate link. First, it presents a hybrid model of <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> which incorporates insights from both portfolio balance models and industrial-organization-based models of <b>direct</b> <b>investment.</b> Second, it tests and compares these three models of <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> using data for Japanese <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> in 12 U. S. manufacturing sectors.; The results suggest that familiar I- 0 determinants of industry profitability attract Japanese <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> into U. S. manufacturing. Lower raw material costs, more profitable investment opportunities (as measured particularly by growing markets, presence of valuable patents, and more highly concentrated production structure), as well as trade barriers all significantly increase Japanese <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> in U. S. manufacturing industries.; Portfolio balance factors also affect the demand for U. S. assets. Greater Japanese internal and external savings and reduced profitability of alternative assets (including ownership stakes in Japanese domestic industries) lead to significant increases in <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> <b>transactions</b> in U.

40|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1970 s, many states adopted intrastate {{branching}} and interstate banking deregulations that lifted restrictions on bank expansions, and facilitated access to finance. We evaluate {{the effects of the}} two banking deregulations and the accompanying reduction in credit constraints on foreign firms investing in the U. S. We provide direct, micro-level evidence from U. S. inward foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> (FDI) <b>transactions</b> showing that facilitating access to local finance increases the entry rate of foreign multinationals and the number of transactions while reducing the average transaction value, i. e. when credit constraints are relaxed, smaller FDI transactions stand a greater chance of being completed.

Although both are found to seek out large markets with low international barriers, important dif- ferences emerge. MA is more affected by geographic and cultural barriers and exhibits opportunistic behaviours as it is more sensitive to short-run changes, such as a currency crisis. On the other hand, GF is relatively driven by long-run factors, such as origin-country technological and institutional development or comparative advantage. These empirical facts are consistent with the conceptual distinction made between these two modes, i. e. MA involves transfer of ownership for integration or arbitrage reasons while GF relies on firms own capacities, which are linked to the origin countries attributes. They also suggest that GF and MA are likely to respond differently to policies intended to attract FDI...|$|R

This book is a combination of the author’s research and 15 -year practical experience in managing <b>investment</b> <b>transactions</b> in China. This book uniquely offers both a theoretical overview of the phenomenon of FDI in China (chapters two to four) as well as the practical steps in executing <b>investment</b> <b>transactions</b> there (chapters five to seven). The author also provides illustrative charts and tables, literature summaries, transaction templates based on case studies from his real-life experience on the ground. This is so far the only book on FDI in China which covers both the theoretical perspectives as well as practical advices in investments. This book serves not only as a useful resource for students, teachers and policy makers who are interested in both theoretical and practical aspects of FDI in China, but also a valuable guidebook for business development executives, <b>investment</b> professionals and <b>transaction</b> lawyers who are involved in <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> deals in China on a daily basis...|$|R
40|$|The paper reviews {{a number}} of issues related to the use of {{currencies}} in international trade, more than one decade after the introduction of the euro and shortly after steps taken by the Chinese authorities to liberalize the use of the RMB in off-shore markets. Trade {{is an important factor in}} establishing a currency as an international currency, notably by fulfilling the transaction/medium of exchange and unit of account motives of currency demand. A well prepared liberalization of currency use for international trade and foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> <b>transactions</b> can even be helpful in achieving the international investment and reserve currency status. While in the distant past the later was also linked to preponderance of a country in trade markets, it is now linked to the prevalence of the currency in international financial transactions, which supposes that the country in question engages at least partly in some liberalization of capital account transactions. This paper shows theoretical and practical reasons explaining the current dominance of the US dollar and the euro in the invoicing of international trade. There is little doubt, though, that in the medium-to-long term the RMB will become a major currency of settlement in international trade. This is not only the current direction of government policy but also that of markets, as evidenced by the rapid expansion of off-shore trade payments in that currency. In the meantime, though, the US dollar and the euro are enjoying a near-duopoly as settlement and invoicing currencies in international trade. The stability of this duopoly is enhanced by {{a number of}} factors recently highlighted by economic analysis: coalescing, thick externalities and scarcity of international currencies are useful to explain that, until such time that RMB payments match at least the share of China in global trade, the US dollar and of the euro will remain the main currencies in the invoicing and payment of international trade. Section 1 looks at the factors that determine the use of currencies in the invoicing and settlement of international trade. Section 2 looks at the actual reality of currency use for international trade flows, and short-term prospects for the development of a possible alternative to the use of the US dollar and the euro (in particular in Asia), the RMB...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this scoping paper is to offer an {{overview}} of the literature to determine the development to date in the area of residential real estate agency academic and career education in respect to Foreign <b>Direct</b> <b>Investment</b> (FDI) <b>transactions</b> and implications in Australia. This paper will review studies on the issue of foreign real estate ownership and FDI in Australian real estate markets to develop an understanding of the current state of knowledge on residential real estate agency practice, career education and real estate licensing requirements in Australia. The distinction between the real estate profession education, compared to other professions such as accounting, legal and finance is based on the intensity of the professional career training prior or post formal academic training. Real estate education could be carried out with relatively higher standards in terms of licensing requirement, career and academic education. As FDI in the Australian real estate market is a complex globalisation and economic phenomenon, a simple content of residential real estate training and education may not promote proper management or capacity in dealing with relevant foreign residential property market transaction. The preliminary summarising from the literature of residential real estate agency education, with its current relevant or emerging licensing requirement are focused on its role and effectiveness and impact in residential real estate market. Particular focus will be directed to the FDI relevant residential real estate agency transactions and practices, which have been strongly influenced by the current residential real estate market and agency practices. Taken together, there are many opportunities for future research to extend our understanding and improving the residential real estate agency education and training of Foreign <b>Direct</b> <b>Investment</b> in the Australian residential real estate sector...|$|R
