5|$|On June 23, 2001, Judah {{defeated}} Allan Vester by third-round knockout in {{his fifth}} successful {{defense of the}} IBF title. In round two, Judah put Vester down to the canvas twice. In the third round, Judah knocked out Vester with a left hand that connected on Vester's temple. Vester went <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> and nearly lost his mouthpiece. The referee stopped the fight right before the closing bell. The fight would set up a unification match between Judah and WBC and WBA Light Welterweight Champion Kostya Tszyu, who defeated Oktay Urkal on the undercard.|$|E
25|$|Ögedei {{dispatched}} {{him along}} with his relatives to attack the Kipchaks, Russians, and Bulgars in the west in 1235. When the most formidable Kipchak chief, Bachman, fled to {{an island in the}} Volga delta. Möngke crossed the river and captured him. When he ordered Bachman to bend <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> Bachman refused and was executed by Möngke's brother Bujek. Möngke also engaged in hand-to-hand combat during the Mongol invasion of Rus'. While his cousins, Shiban and Büri, went to Crimea, Möngke and Kadan, a son of Ögedei, were ordered to reduce the tribes in the Caucasus. The Mongols captured the Alan capital Maghas and massacred its inhabitants. Many chiefs of the Alans and Circassians surrendered to Möngke. After the conquest of Europe, Möngke would bring them back to Mongolia. He also participated in the Siege of Kiev (1240). Möngke was apparently taken by the splendor of Kiev and offered the city surrender, but his envoys were killed. After Batu's army joined Möngke's soldiers, they sacked the city. He also fought alongside Batu at the Battle of Mohi. In the summer of 1241, before the premature end of the campaign, Möngke returned home after his uncle Ögedei recalled him in the winter of 1240–41. However, Ögedei died.|$|E
500|$|It {{was during}} one of Jackson's calls to Presley that he {{proposed}} marriage. [...] "If I asked you to marry me, would you do it?", the singer queried. Though still married to actor Danny Keough, whom she had wed in 1988 and had two children with, Presley replied that she would. After a pause, Jackson exclaimed {{that he had to}} use the bathroom. Having apparently relieved himself, the singer explained to his new fiancee that his love for her was genuine and she had to believe him. In 2010, Presley acknowledged to Oprah Winfrey that Jackson did formally propose one day in the library, taking out a 10 carat diamond ring and getting <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees.</b>|$|E

500|$|In 1975, the 48-year old Davis {{embarked}} on a three-week tour of Japan; between January 22 and February 8, he played 14 concerts in large-hall venues to capacity crowds and enthusiastic reviews. Japanese critic Keizo Takada said Davis was leading his [...] "magnificent and energetic" [...] band just as Duke Ellington had his orchestra: [...] "Miles must be the genius of managing men and bringing out their hidden talent." [...] Throughout the tour, he had been sick with pneumonia and a bleeding ulcer that grew worse, while his hip occasionally and unpredictably slipped out of its socket. Unable to work his trumpet's volume and effects pedals because of {{the pain in his}} legs, he would go <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> to press them with his hand during performances. To relieve his pain and perform, he used codeine and morphine, smoked, and drank large quantities of Heineken beer. On several occasions, Davis was able to play two concerts in one day, as he did on February 1 at the Festival Hall in Osaka. [...] "The Japanese people were very beautiful", Henderson recalled from the concerts. [...] "They came in with their suit and ties on and we proceeded to blow the roof off the suckers with a million amplifiers." ...|$|E
500|$|Supported by gentry and nobility in East Anglia and the Thames Valley, Mary's {{military}} {{camp was}} gathering strength daily and, through luck, came into possession of powerful artillery from the royal navy. In the circumstances the Duke deemed fighting a campaign hopeless. The army proceeded from Cambridge to Bury St Edmunds and retreated again to Cambridge. On 20 July {{a letter from}} the Council in London arrived, declaring that they had proclaimed Queen Mary and commanding Northumberland to disband the army and await events. Dudley did not contemplate resistance. He explained to his fellow-commanders that they had acted on the Council's orders all the time and that he did not now wish [...] "to combat the Council's decisions, supposing that they have been moved by good reasons ... and I beg your lordships to do the same." [...] Proclaiming Mary Tudor at the market place, he threw up his cap and [...] "so laughed that the tears ran down his cheeks for grief." [...] The next morning the Earl of Arundel arrived to arrest him. A week earlier Arundel had assured Northumberland of his wish to spill his blood even at the Duke's feet; now Dudley went <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> as soon as he caught sight of him.|$|E
2500|$|St-Pierre {{was then}} matched up against top {{contender}} Frank Trigg at UFC 54. St-Pierre controlled {{the fight and}} eventually sneaked in a rear naked choke {{with less than a}} minute remaining in the first round. He then faced future lightweight champion Sean Sherk at UFC 56. Midway through the second round, St-Pierre became the second fighter to defeat Sherk and the first to finish him. [...] During the post-fight interview, he famously went <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> with an impassioned plea to UFC management to give him another title shot.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the daily}} and Sabbath services, when the line (numbered, above, as line 9, here {{translated}} literally) [...] "But we bend our knees and bow" [...] is recited, the worshipper will flex {{his knees and}} then bend from the waist, straightening up {{by the time the}} words [...] "before (lif'nei) the King of kings of kings" [...] are reached. But on the High Holy Days of Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, the worshipper will not merely flex and bend, but will actually get <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> at those words, and some Sefardic and Mizrahi congregants will prostrate themselves on the floor (in those synagogues with sufficient floor space).|$|E
2500|$|Norwich in {{the late}} 17th century was riven politically. Churchman Humphrey Prideaux {{described}} [...] "two factions, Whig and Tory [...] and both contend for their way with the utmost violence." [...] Nor did the city accept {{the outcome of the}} 1688 Glorious Revolution with a unified voice. The pre-eminent citizen, Bishop William Lloyd, would not take the oaths of allegiance to the new monarchs. One report has it that in 1704 the landlord of Fowler's alehouse [...] "with a glass of beer in hand, went <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> and drank a health to James the third, wishing the Crowne [...] well and settled on his head." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{process was}} usually {{carried out by}} single executioner, usage of firing squads being limited to wartime executions. The most common method {{was to make the}} convict walk into a {{dead-end}} room, and shoot him from behind {{in the back of the}} head with a handgun. In some cases, the convict could be forced <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees.</b> Some prisons were rumored to have specially designed rooms with fire slits, while in others the convict was tied to the floor, his head against a blood draining hole. [...] Another method was to make the convict walk out of the prison building, where he was awaited by the executioner and a truck with the engine and headlamps turned on. The lights blinded and disoriented the convict, while the noise of the engine muffled the shot. Sometimes the execution was carried out outdoors in front of the grave in which the convict was to be buried.|$|E
60|$|There sat Tom, on {{a little}} mossy seat in the court, {{every one of his}} button-holes stuck full of cape jessamines, and Eva, gayly laughing, was hanging a wreath of roses round his neck; and then she sat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>knee,</b> like a chip-sparrow, still laughing.|$|R
60|$|On seeing this, {{the dear}} old woodman fell <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>knee,</b> saying, 'O my Princess, O my gracious royal lady, O my {{rightful}} Queen of Crim Tartary,--I hail thee--I acknowledge thee--I do thee homage!' And in token of his fealty, {{he rubbed his}} venerable nose three times on the ground, and put the Princess's foot <b>on</b> <b>his</b> head.|$|R
6000|$|It WAS funny. Aunt Olivia {{thought it}} very unbecoming {{to sit there}} before us, but he made her do it.

2500|$|The {{film was}} {{produced}} by Warner Bros., using its new Vitaphone sound process. Vitaphone was originally intended for musical renditions, and The Jazz Singer follows this principle, with only the musical sequences using live sound recording. The moviegoers were electrified when the silent actions were interrupted periodically for a song sequence with real singing and sound. Jolson's dynamic voice, physical mannerisms, and charisma held the audience spellbound. Costar May McAvoy, according to author A. Scott Berg, could not help sneaking into theaters day after day as the film was being run. [...] "She pinned herself against a wall {{in the dark and}} watched the faces in the crowd. In that moment just before 'Toot, Toot, Tootsie,' she remembered, 'A miracle occurred. Moving pictures really came alive. To see the expressions on their faces, when Joley spoke to them ... you'd have thought they were listening to the voice of God.'" [...] "Everybody was mad for the talkies," [...] said movie star Gregory Peck in a Newsweek interview. [...] "I remember [...] 'The Jazz Singer,' [...] when Al Jolson just burst into song, and {{there was a little bit}} of dialogue. And when he came out with 'Mammy,' and went <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> to his Mammy, it was just dynamite." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 56, {{he married}} Li Shuxian, a {{hospital}} nurse, on 30 April 1962, in a ceremony held at the Banquet Hall of the Consultative Conference. From 1964 until his death he worked as an editor for the literary department of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, where his monthly salary was around 100 yuan. One yuan in the 1960s was equivalent to about 40 cents USD. Li recalled in a 1995 interview that: [...] "I found Pu Yi a honest man, a man who desperately needed my love {{and was ready to}} give me as much love as he could. When I was having even a slight case of flu, he was so worried I would die, that he refused to sleep at night and sat by my bedside until dawn so he could attend to my needs". Li also noted like everybody else who knew him that Puyi was an incredibly clumsy man, leading her to say: [...] "Once in a boiling rage at his clumsiness, I threatened to divorce him. On hearing this, he got <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> and, with tears in his eyes, he begged me to forgive him. I shall never forget what he said to me: 'I have nothing in this world except you, and you are my life. If you go, I will die'. But apart from him, what did I ever have in the world?".|$|E

60|$|It {{was good}} cat's meat. Dumps liked it. The {{enormous}} supper {{with which he}} had lain down was by that time nearly assimilated, and appetite had begun to revive. Going <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> the young burglar held out a third morsel of temptation in his hand. Dumps meekly advanced and took the meat. It was a sad illustration of {{the ease with which}} even a dog descends from bad to worse.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I adopt {{you from}} this day," [...] says the Dowager, [...] "and I wish I was richer, for your sake, son Esmond," [...] she {{added with a}} wave of her hand; and as Mr. Esmond dutifully went <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> before her ladyship, she cast her eyes up to the ceiling, (the gilt chandelier, and the twelve wax-candles in it, for the party was numerous,) and invoked a blessing from that quarter upon the newly adopted son.|$|R

25|$|Unfortunately, he {{took the}} best man's jacket by accident, which had the wedding ring inside. Bending over at Henrietta's door to tie his shoes, the ring falls out, and Henrietta {{opens the door to}} see Ted <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>knee,</b> in a tuxedo, with a ring in his hand. She {{immediately}} assumes he is proposing, says yes, and introduces him to her parents (who had stopped by).

You will pay him obedience in everything, and I pray you may grow to be as learned and as good as your tutor." ...|$|R
