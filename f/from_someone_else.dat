5|$|Keeping {{track of}} the enemies' {{strengths}} and weaknesses was made more consistent with different types of health bars so that players {{did not have to}} estimate what types of challenges they were facing when fighting new enemies. The game's HUD was revised eight times during development. As the inventory management of the original Mass Effect received criticism, designing a new inventory system for Mass Effect 2 {{was one of the main}} concerns during development. Ideally, the inventory needed to be able to handle a large number of characters with simplicity. Norman spent time examining various inventory systems from other RPG games, but none could be applied to support the game's large number of characters. Ultimately, the team opted to replaced it with a set of different systems that provide the same functionality without any sort of management. This concept allowed a character to use a weapon without taking it away <b>from</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
5|$|Labillardière did not {{acknowledge}} any collector, {{and so it}} was long thought that Labillardière himself had collected the first botanical specimens in 1792 while naturalist to Bruni d'Entrecasteaux's expedition in search of the lost ships of Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse. However, this and eight other species described by Labillardière do not occur in any locations that he visited, suggesting that he obtained specimens <b>from</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> whom he failed to credit. Though he did not specify a type specimen for A.obovata, a specimen upon which the accompanying figure in Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen appears to be based has been located; it is annotated, apparently in Labillardière's hand, as having been collected by Leschenault. Ernest Charles Nelson states with certainty that Labillardière based this species on specimens collected by Leschenault, and this view has been accepted by some scholars though others treat it more cautiously.|$|E

25|$|Oddly enough, this Baldrick {{seems to}} have a bit of the idiot savant in him; Baldrick's explanation, {{although}} heard <b>from</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else,</b> of why George and Blackadder will be able to trade places is surprisingly smart and articulate, suggesting he might have an amazing memory with words, even if he does not understand what they mean.|$|E
25|$|Interpretation is {{sometimes}} listed by voice teachers as a fifth physical process even though strictly speaking {{it is not}} a physical process. The {{reason for this is that}} interpretation does influence the kind of sound a singer makes which is ultimately achieved through a physical action the singer is doing. Although teachers may acquaint their students with musical styles and performance practices and suggest certain interpretive effects, most voice teachers agree that interpretation can not be taught. Students who lack a natural creative imagination and aesthetic sensibility can not learn it <b>from</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else.</b> Failure to interpret well is not a vocal fault, even though it may affect vocal sound significantly.|$|E
50|$|John {{was famous}} for his nose whistle, a {{whistling}} sound he would make, both on purpose and involuntarily, through his nose. The nose whistle {{was also one of}} John's tactics for making opposing lawyers nervous in court since John was also capable of making it sound as if the whistle came <b>from</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else's</b> nose.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} missions. The last-ditch mission is [...] "immediate suppression": Every gun in any concerned battery immediately fires whatever round and fuse is loaded, possibly <b>from</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else's,</b> or more than one callsign's mission. The FO may end up getting parachute flares, white phosphorus illumination, DPICM, and VT-HE rounds on the target in the same shot.|$|R
50|$|The newuniversal {{version of}} Justice also has {{different}} abilities - although their extent {{is as yet}} unrevealed, he appears to possess a limited form of telepathy, allowing him to read misdeeds <b>from</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else's</b> mind. He also manifests solid constructs made from glowing energy; these appear as either flat, rectangular panels which he uses as shields or platforms, or angular shapes which he uses as cutting blades.|$|R
25|$|Procrastination is {{considerably}} more widespread in students {{than in the}} general population, with over 70 percent of students reporting procrastination for assignments at some point. A 2014 panel study from Germany among several thousand university students found that increasing academic procrastination increases the frequency of seven different forms of academic misconduct, i.e., using fraudulent excuses, plagiarism, copying <b>from</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> in exams, using forbidden means in exams, carrying forbidden means into exams, copying parts of homework from others, fabrication or falsification of data and the variety of academic misconduct. This study argues that academic misconduct {{can be seen as}} a means to cope with the negative consequences of academic procrastination such as performance impairment.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Carrington takes the Doctor {{to meet the}} astronauts a {{criminal}} named Reegan has organised their abduction, killing the soldiers and scientists guarding them. When the Doctor and Liz examine the site, they realise that human tissue could not have withstood the degree of radiation being emitted by the mysteriously irradiated astronauts. The Doctor believes the real astronauts are still in orbit, and that the three space suits contain alien beings. Reegan engineers the kidnapping of Liz Shaw to aid his own scientist, Lennox, a disgraced Cambridge professor, in keeping the alien astronauts alive. Reegan has even been supplied with a device {{to communicate with the}} aliens, and sends them to the Space Centre to kill Quinlan. It now becomes clear to UNIT that the aliens are emitting radiation like walking reactors, and that to touch them brings instant death. It is also evident, to Liz, that Reegan is taking orders <b>from</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else.</b> She helps Lennox escape, and he tries to reach the Brigadier, but his bid for freedom is cut short by Reegan’s merciless revenge.|$|E
25|$|From {{the start}} Genie showed {{interest}} in many hospital staff members, often approaching and walking with complete strangers, but Kent {{said she did}} not seem to distinguish between people and showed no signs of attachment to anybody, including her mother and brother. At first she would not allow anyone to touch her, quickly shying away from any physical contact, and while she sat on her mother's lap when requested she remained very tense and got up as quickly as possible; hospital staff wrote that her mother seemed entirely oblivious to Genie's emotions and actions. Genie's behavior was typically highly antisocial, and proved extremely difficult for others to control. Regardless of where she was she constantly salivated and spat, and continually sniffed and blew her nose on anything that happened to be nearby. She had no sense of personal property, frequently pointing to or taking something she wanted <b>from</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else,</b> or situational awareness. Doctors wrote that she acted on impulse irrespective of the setting, especially noting that she frequently engaged in open masturbation and would sometimes attempt to involve older men in it.|$|E
5000|$|For {{artillery}} batteries, the last-ditch {{mission that}} a forward observer can call up is [...] "immediate suppression." [...] This orders every gun in any concerned battery to immediately fire whatever round and fuse is loaded, possibly <b>from</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else's,</b> {{or more than}} one callsign's mission. The FO may end up getting white phosphorus illumination, DPICM, and VT-HE rounds on the target in the same shot.|$|R

500|$|After {{watching}} someone {{play the}} game for about two-and-a-half hours, Lawrence eventually retracted her earlier statements. She added {{that she had been}} told the game was similar to pornography, and noted that she [...] "has seen episodes of Lost that are more sexually explicit." [...] In the interim, largely as a reaction from an offended gaming community, her latest book attracted many customer reviews on Amazon which rated it one star out of five. Many of these reviews satirically noted that they had not read her book, but heard <b>from</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> that the book was bad, and thus voted low. Mass Effect was also banned in Singapore for a short time before it was lifted with an M18 rating. Censors in the country said that a scene with an alien and human female caressing was the main reason why the game was not allowed to be sold in video game stores.|$|E
500|$|... "Forgive Me" [...] is an R, {{soul and}} dance-pop song written in A minor. It moves at 120 {{beats per minute}} and is set in common time. On it, Lewis {{performs}} her highest pitch (G5) in falsetto during the final chorus, and her lowest pitch (A3) during each verse. The song refers to a protagonist in a one-sided relationship who leaves her boyfriend and eventually finds someone to reciprocate her love. Though she has found love <b>from</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else,</b> she defends herself and asks her ex-boyfriend for forgiveness. In an interview with Digital Spy, Lewis explained why she decided in change the musical genre of her previous singles, from contemporary R to dance-pop. She said: [...] "I {{wanted to do something}} a bit different and the chance to work with Akon came about. I'm really pleased with how it's turned out and it's great that it's different, rather than what I always do." [...] There are two versions of the song, the [...] "album version" [...] (3:41) and the [...] "single mix" [...] (3:25), which was used in the music video. The album version repeats the bridge two times, ...|$|E
2500|$|Much of {{the rest}} of the script was stolen from the Journal article. Zaslow said at the time that CBS had [...] "been very gracious and apologetic, and we at the Journal {{appreciate}} it." [...] In a case of double plagiarism, the producer who wrote the piece copied <b>from</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> for Couric, and the anchor claimed the words were hers when they were not. The producer responsible for Couric's piece, Melissa McNamara, was fired hours after the Journal contacted CBS News to complain. The network promised changes in its procedures.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, after {{ending a}} year-long {{starring}} role in a stage production of Tony and Tina's Wedding at the Rio Hotel in Las Vegas, Mollner moved to Los Angeles {{to pursue a career}} in the film industry. Believing his dream to direct films was a long shot, JT did not pursue it immediately, instead taking small acting jobs to pay the bills, while writing screenplays in his spare time. Mollner soon became frustrated with acting in LA, explaining {{in an interview that he}} was tired of [...] "being a tool in <b>someone</b> <b>else's</b> vision...having to read lines <b>from</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else's</b> script...while wanting to be doing what directors are doing".|$|R
2500|$|Especially {{noteworthy}} {{has been}} 'the work of Nicolas Abraham and Mária Török on the intergenerational {{transmission of the}} phantom' created by trauma. 'Abraham and Török use the word [...] "nescience" [...] to describe the phantom effect. It refers to the gap in knowledge where the trauma resides'. Arguably at least 'the [...] "phantom" [...] represents a radical reorientation of Freudian and post-Freudian theories of psychopathology, since here symptoms do not spring from the individual's own life experiences but <b>from</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else's</b> psychic conflicts, traumas, or secrets'.|$|R
50|$|Through the {{investigation}} of Moore, it was learned that she had once staged a scene to fraudulently keep a Lincoln Navigator which {{was in danger of}} being repossessed after falling behind on the payments. She had someone store the car in a garage and then pretended she was kidnapped, sexually assaulted and carjacked. Investigators claimed she taped her own wrists and threw herself <b>from</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else's</b> car. She even took a rape exam. She later pleaded no contest to the charge and received probation.|$|R

2500|$|Upon his return, her CPA father {{quickly found}} the discrepancy. Her actions scared {{him and he}} desperately wanted to help his {{daughter}} before she was beyond help. He began taking her for drug tests, and told her if she failed, {{he would go to}} the police with the forged checks. She passed several tests using diluted urine or getting a clean sample <b>from</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else,</b> but she finally tested positive. By now, she had stopped going to school, and her parents decided this might be their last opportunity to intervene. Forgery charges were filed, and Lindsey was arrested.|$|E
2500|$|For {{a school}} to be fully {{committed}} to implementing PLCs, the school's leadership must help establish and maintain PLCs. Successful PLCs will require {{a shift in the}} traditional leadership structure from leader-centered (top-down) to shared leadership. Sue C. Thompson and her colleagues pointed out how many educators often feel that [...] "new ideas that came <b>from</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> without teacher input" [...] are {{a waste of time and}} do not qualify as true leadership or support. In a PLC, the view of the principal as the instructional leader changes to a view that reflects the principal as a member of a community of learners and leaders.|$|E

50|$|The {{movie was}} based on an idea by {{director}} Geoffrey Nottage. Producer Jan Chapman had just made two telemovies written by Louis Nowra and hired Nowra to write the script. Nowra was reluctant to work on a project that came <b>from</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else's</b> idea but enjoyed collaborating with Chapman and had just read Jules Verne's Mistress Branican which had a similar plot and felt the offer was too serendipitous to refuse. Nowra later said he thought Nottage did a good job as director but was dissatisfied with the limitations of working for television.|$|R
5000|$|Function 4 - the {{vulnerable}} function, or place of least resistance, is a weak and conscious function, {{in addition to}} being the weakest function of the psyche. One painfully perceives his complete inability to use this function, and reacts negatively to its imposition upon him. Tactful assistance is required <b>from</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else's</b> strong function (preferably the Function 8) to overcome the problems associated with this function. According to Bukalov, this function is single dimensional, i.e. only personal experience is collected here, and it cannot be adapted even to the social norms.|$|R

2500|$|Working less {{is another}} {{component}} of freeganism. Freegans oppose {{the notion of}} working {{for the sole purpose}} of accumulating material items. They claim that their need to work is reduced by only purchasing the basic necessities and acquiring the remainder for free from the garbage. According to freegans, not working frees up additional time for political action while avoiding tasks they see as sacrificing valuable time to [...] "take orders <b>from</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else,</b> stress, boredom, monotony, and in many cases risks to physical and psychological well-being". As with squatting, however, the degree of concordance between freegan ideology and practices is variable. In surveys, self-described freegans vary from reporting working only irregularly, working consistently in social justice organizations, and being employed in more conventional, [...] "capitalist" [...] occupations.|$|E
2500|$|According to the report, the IAEA shared {{intelligence}} with Iran recently {{provided by}} the US regarding [...] "alleged studies" [...] on a nuclear weaponization program. The information was allegedly obtained from a laptop computer smuggled out of Iran and provided to the US in mid-2004. The laptop was reportedly received from a [...] "longtime contact" [...] in Iran who obtained it <b>from</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> now believed to be dead. A senior European diplomat warned [...] "I can fabricate that data," [...] and argued that the documents look [...] "beautiful, but is open to doubt." [...] The United States has relied on the laptop to prove that Iran intends to develop nuclear weapons. In November 2007, the United States National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) believed that Iran halted an alleged active nuclear weapons program in fall 2003. Iran has dismissed the laptop information as a fabrication, and other diplomats have dismissed the information as relatively insignificant and coming too late.|$|E
5000|$|In {{situations}} where one's physical appearance and actions are important (for example, {{giving a speech}} {{in front of an}} audience), the memory of that situation will likely be remembered in the observer perspective. This is due to the general trend that when the focus of attention in a person's memory is on themselves, they will likely see themselves <b>from</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else's</b> point of view. This is because in [...] "center-of-attention" [...] memories, the person is conscious about the way they are presenting themselves and instinctively try to envision how others were perceiving them.|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{the nature}} of fan art, there are many debated facets of the topic. One of the most {{prominent}} controversies surrounding fan art is its validity as art at all. Some people in the art community believe that since fan art is based on <b>someone</b> <b>else's</b> original content, it doesn't deserve to be considered [...] "art." [...] Their definition of art entails that it must be an expression of the artist, and artwork that is derived from already-existing content cannot fulfill this. A counter-argument to this statement is that fan artists add their own individual style to the art they create. Although the concept may derive <b>from</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else's</b> work, the content equally as individualistic and expressive as any other form of art.|$|R
40|$|When a {{creative}} non-fiction story is crafted <b>from</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else’s</b> lived experience, striking {{a balance between}} the interpretive authority of the writer and the ethical treatment of the subject can be problematic. This paper argues that waving the usual flags about informed consent, confidentiality and anonymity is an ineffectual way of dealing with potential threats to an interviewee’s privacy, reputation and sense of self. The ethical quandaries that can arise when using lives as material for writing are discussed in the context of my own attempt to take a non-exploitative, non-maleficent, collaborative approach to the task of producing non-superficial, non-rose-tinted, nuanced accounts of home-based palliative caregiving...|$|R
