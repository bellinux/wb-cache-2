25|$|Paul Krugman {{stated that}} the {{institutions}} built by the New Deal remain the bedrock of the United States economic stability. Against {{the background of the}} 2007–2012 global financial crisis he explained that the financial crises would have been much worse if the New Deals Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had not insured most bank deposits and older Americans would have <b>felt</b> <b>much</b> more insecure without Social Security. Libertarian economist Milton Friedman after 1960 attacked Social Security from a free market view stating that it had created welfare dependency.|$|E
25|$|Much {{focus was}} put on Clara and Alice being {{in junior high school}} at the time. From early on when they {{uploaded}} their covers onto Niconico, there was some disbelief whether the girls were actually in junior high school and there were numerous comments on their adult-sounding voices. Despite this, Clara and Alice were described as simply normal junior high school girls, and while Kz <b>felt</b> <b>much</b> of their appeal came from them being in junior high school, he also felt their future potential played a part in it.|$|E

25|$|The {{reduction}} in public expenditures, {{which was at}} the heart of the stabilization program, slowed the economy sharply in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Real gross national product declined 1.5 percent in 1979 and 1.3 percent in 1980. The manufacturing and services sectors <b>felt</b> <b>much</b> of the impact of this drop in income, with the manufacturing sector operating at close to 50 percent of total capacity. As the external-payments constraint eased, the economy bounced back sharply. Between 1981 and 1985, real GNP grew 3 percent per year, led by growth in the manufacturing sector. With tight controls on workers' earnings and activities, the industrial sector began drawing on unused industrial capacity and raised output by an average rate of 9.1 percent per year between 1981 and 1985. The devaluation of the lira also helped make Turkey more economically competitive. As a result, exports of manufactures increased by an average rate of 45 percent per annum during this period.|$|E
500|$|Wooden Leg {{attended}} a [...] "peace feast" [...] at the Little Bighorn {{to commemorate the}} 30th anniversary of the battle. [...] Some Cheyenne veterans would not go, fearful of retribution from the soldiers present. [...] As late as 1926 there were still Cheyennes who would {{not go to the}} 50th anniversary. [...] Wooden Leg himself did not attend the 50th anniversary, not out of fear, but because the site was now on Crow land, to whom he still <b>felt</b> <b>much</b> animosity. [...] He had resolved [...] "never again to go to any place where I might be called upon to shake hands with a Crow". [...] This was very different to his attitude to other former enemies such as the Shoshones, to whom he travelled on a friendly visit. [...] In 1913 Wooden Leg was part of a Cheyenne delegation to Washington. [...] He also visited New York and Philadelphia during this trip.|$|E
500|$|McMahan {{reflected}} on the album's success: [...] "We worked really hard on Spiderland. I mean, I definitely <b>felt</b> <b>much</b> more personal about it. I thought it represented us as people, musically, {{a lot more than}} Tweez did. That's about it. It seemed like when we were around, and actively playing and stuff, that people's responses to us were fairly ambivalent. I thought it was funny when the press picked up on it. For an independent release, it had a strange sort of audience and kept selling three or four years after we recorded it; it still sells more copies than when it first came out." [...] Touch and Go founder Corey Rusk said that Spiderland is [...] "like an icon now. But when it came out, nobody cared! The band had broken up by the time the album came out, and it really didn't sell particularly well or get written about all that much in the year it was released. But it was a revolutionary, groundbreaking record, and it's one of the few instances where people catch up to it later on."

500|$|Egan {{joked that}} {{although}} [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] was [...] "fun" [...] to perform, she <b>felt</b> <b>much</b> more [...] "white" [...] than usual recording alongside the five singers {{cast as the}} Muses, who provide the song's back up vocals. Familiar with singers Cheryl Freeman, Lillias White, Vaneese Y. Thomas, LaChanze and Roz Ryan's Broadway work, Egan felt intimated by their powerful voices and riffing abilities. Egan recalled, [...] "Alan would say, 'Okay Lillias (White), just do a riff over there and LaChanze, you do a little something over here and Susan, just at the end, get from this note to this note and just do a riff.' I raise my hand and I'm like, 'Umm, can you plunk {{it out on the}} piano?' He looks at me like, 'Are you kidding?'" [...] While it took Egan half an hour to solidify only one of her riffs, the other singers recorded multiple takes of theirs within that same time; Egan was greatly humbled by the experience. On the film's soundtrack, only Egan and Freeman are credited as vocalists on the track. Menken also produced the song. Danny Troob arranged the song while Michael Kosarin conducted the orchestration.|$|E
500|$|After {{writing songs}} with themes of {{independence}} for Control and social injustice for Rhythm Nation 1814, Jackson desired to devote {{her new album}} to love and relationships, describing the theme of her new album as [...] "intimacy" [...] and that [...] "exual communication {{is the name of}} the game." [...] She stated in an interview with David Wild for Rolling Stone that [...] "hile I was doing Rhythm Nation, I was thinking about how things were so hard, so regimented and so black and white... I thought I'd do something on the sexy side—which is hard for me since I grew up as a tomboy and don't really think of myself that way. But I think this album is more on the feminine tip." [...] She also commented on how her experience acting in Poetic Justice played a role in taking a new direction with her music. Speaking with biographer David Ritz, she stated that [...] "Rhythm Nation was a heavy record, and Poetic Justice was a heavy movie. I wanted to do something lighter but also daring... When I wrote the album, I was still in a poetic frame of mind, inspired by Maya's beautiful language. You can hear that inspiration or the interludes and especially on the song [...] "New Agenda". This time I <b>felt</b> <b>much</b> freer expressing myself." ...|$|E
500|$|Portal 2s {{additional}} gameplay elements, like light bridges, lasers, and the gels, were praised {{as appropriate}} {{additions to the}} game. Reviewers were pleased with {{the difficulty of the}} puzzles throughout the game, which appeared visually complicated at first but had uncomplicated solutions. Times Evan Narcisse said that he feared the addition of new gameplay elements would [...] "dilute the purity of the experience, but everything's still executed with Valve's high level of charm and panache." [...] Tom Hoggins of The Telegraph praised the manner with which these elements were introduced through a [...] "brilliant learning curve of direction, rather than instruction", and considered it a [...] "design ethos that is supremely generous, but dealt with marvellous economy". Chris Kohler of Wired wrote that the game's puzzles [...] "never require excessively complicated solutions", and that much of the puzzle solving is [...] "filled with moments that will have you slapping your forehead and thinking, 'Oh my God, I'm such an idiotwhy didn't I see that before?. Stapleton was not as pleased with the gel additions as with the other new mechanics, calling it [...] "difficult to control". He felt that they have [...] "only a couple of uses at most". Bright felt that Portal 2 was easier than its predecessor, in part that he <b>felt</b> <b>much</b> of the game was effectively tutorials for the new gameplay additions, requiring [...] "careful use of the tools provided", leaving him with the impression that [...] "the game was on rails".|$|E

2500|$|Psychologically, younger gymnasts {{may be more}} fearless, {{and have}} less visceral {{appreciation}} for the potential for injury. They are therefore more likely to perform more dangerous, and more highly scored, routines with confidence and steadiness. “Psychologically, I think they worry less,” former Olympic medallist Nellie Kim told the New York Times. Daniela Silivaş, in her interview, commented, [...] "You should know that I competed better {{at the age of}} 13 than at 17. I <b>felt</b> <b>much</b> better, physical (sic) and mentally." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1911, Bartók wrote {{what was}} to be his only opera, Bluebeard's Castle, {{dedicated}} to Márta. He entered it for a prize by the Hungarian Fine Arts Commission, but they rejected his work as not fit for the stage [...] In 1917 Bartók revised the score for the 1918 première, and rewrote the ending. Following the 1919 revolution in which he actively participated, he was pressured by the Horthy regime to remove the name of the librettist Béla Balázs from the opera , as he was blacklisted and had left the country for Vienna. Bluebeard's Castle received only one revival, in 1936, before Bartók emigrated. For the remainder of his life, although he was passionately devoted to Hungary, its people and its culture, he never <b>felt</b> <b>much</b> loyalty to the government or its official establishments.|$|E
2500|$|Tani {{notes that}} she {{immediately}} <b>felt</b> <b>much</b> more relaxed upon retirement. [...] "I didn't {{have to worry}} about going out in the sun. I could suddenly enjoy the outdoors, golf and the beach." [...] Her early retirement from film was clouded by difficulty however. In 1981 she was hit by a car while walking her dog, and had to undergo extensive rehabilitation for three years. This difficult period in her life continued with her 1984 divorce from her husband. After the divorce, she opened the Ohtani restaurant in Kumamoto, which became highly successful, and which she currently owns. In 1996 she also opened [...] "Yours Naomi", a video store near Hakata which specializes in erotic cinema, especially Nikkatsu's Roman Porno films. She comments that [...] "Many young people (in their 20s and 30s) who used to buy the mindless AV [...] junk have shifted to 'Roman Porn' after being introduced to it." ...|$|E

2500|$|At dawn, Zhang Liao donned his armour, {{carried a}} ji, and led {{his men to}} attack the enemy formation. He killed tens of enemy {{soldiers}} and two officers, shouted his own name, and broke through the barriers until he reached Sun Quan's command post. Sun Quan was shocked and his subordinates were all unsure of what to do. He {{then went to the}} top of a knoll, armed himself with a long ji, and stood there. He did not dare to move when Zhang Liao challenged him to come down and fight him. When Sun Quan saw that Zhang Liao did not have many soldiers left with him, he ordered his forces to surround Zhang and his men. However, Zhang Liao fought fiercely and succeeded in breaking out of the encirclement with a few of his men. His remaining men, who were still trapped by the enemy, shouted, [...] "General, are you abandoning us?" [...] Zhang Liao then turned back and fought his way into the encirclement and succeeded in rescuing his remaining men. Sun Quan and his forces were all stunned by Zhang Liao's valour and did not dare to stand in his way. The skirmish lasted from dawn to the afternoon, and the morale of Sun Quan's army had fallen significantly. Zhang Liao returned to Hefei fortress and strengthened his defences. The defenders <b>felt</b> <b>much</b> more at ease and were very impressed with him.|$|E
2500|$|Wharton married Anna Corbit Lovering, {{a fellow}} Quaker {{and the younger}} sister of his brother Charles' wife, in 1854 in a Quaker ceremony. After living with Anna's family for several months the couple moved into a house {{belonging}} to his mother near 12th and Walnut Streets in Philadelphia, but Anna often continued {{to stay with her}} parents while Joseph was out of town. She preferred a life of comfort but evidently did not wish to stifle his ambition. During this time Wharton lived a spartan life, boarding at a hotel and managing the zinc works in Bethlehem, and Anna cared for their first child Joanna at their home in Philadelphia. Although Joseph returned as often as possible and they communicated often by letter, they <b>felt</b> <b>much</b> stress during this period and their marriage suffered. Later, when Joseph was more secure in his job manufacturing zinc, Anna and Joanna came to live with him in Bethlehem, where they lived a happier life for two years, partaking in social events and exploring the local rivers and countryside. After Wharton sold his interest in zinc, they returned to Philadelphia, and although he often traveled to oversee his properties or develop business connections, he never again lived apart from the family. He purchased a country estate several miles north of Philadelphia, called [...] "Ontalauna", and bought a donkey for their three children, Joanna, Mary, and Anna, to ride along on horseback expeditions. Wharton often studied at night or played history games with the children.|$|E
2500|$|IGN {{gave the}} game 9.0 out of 10 and an Editor's Choice Award, praising the game's [...] "pure {{over-the-top}} driving entertainment. The cars and environments are gorgeous, the crashes are spectacular, {{and the new}} Autolog feature breathes {{new life into the}} time-honored tradition of video game competition among friends." [...] Eurogamer gave the game 9 out of 10. Reviewer Tom Bramwell said [...] "It's stuffed with content but rarely for the sake of it, and knowing Criterion it will be handsomely supported for months to come, even though it's already the best pure arcade racing game since Burnout Paradise." [...] GameTrailers also scored the game 9 out of 10. The reviewer stated Hot Pursuit was [...] "excellently crafted, letting you take the world's fastest cars across miles of stunning landscapes. Chases are exhilarating from either perspective, and the autolog feature completely changes how you compete with friends, keeping you hooked until you've wrecked all of their scores." [...] Destructoid gave the game 9.5 out of 10. Reviewer Nick Chester noted that [...] "it delivers a near-perfect competitive experience, in a way that few games - racing or otherwise - can. Hot Pursuit is not only a defining moment for the series, but for arcade-style racing, period." [...] Reviewer Randy Nelson of Joystiq was the second reviewer to give the game a perfect score of 10/10. Reviewer Chris Antista of GamesRadar also gave the game 10 out of 10. Chris stated that [...] "with so many modes and diverse rewards to uncover in Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit, it almost feels like 2.5 games in one package." [...] Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewer Brett Bates gave the game 9.0 out of 10, which <b>felt</b> <b>much</b> the same as GamesRadar's Chris Antista, stating [...] "In effect, you're getting two games in one: What you do as a racer has no bearing on what you do as a cop." ...|$|E
