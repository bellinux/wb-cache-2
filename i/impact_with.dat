5|$|America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) (AWM) and Triple X (Christopher Daniels and Elix Skipper) (XXX) {{continued}} their rivalry at Turning Point in a match that was contested inside a 16foot (4.9m) high steel structure with six sides {{known as a}} Six Sides of Steel. The match was announced on the November 19 episode of <b>Impact!</b> <b>with</b> the added stipulation that the losing team would have to disband forever. AMW won the match {{and as a result}} XXX had to disband.|$|E
5|$|An off spinner, Johnson was {{a member}} of Bradman’s first-choice team, playing in four of the five Tests before being dropped for the final match. However, he was not {{prominent}} in the Tests, taking seven wickets at a bowling average of 61.00. Among the frontline bowlers who played in four or more Tests, Johnson had the worst average by a factor of almost two and took the least number of wickets. Johnson had little <b>impact</b> <b>with</b> the bat, scoring 51 runs at a batting average of 10.20, but took five catches in the slips.|$|E

Apart from one catch on her debut, she did not make any more dismissals. Australia lost all five matches. She was then omitted for the three ODIs in New Zealand as batsman Jess Cameron stood in as a {{makeshift}} wicket-keeper.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, an Argentine Army {{expedition}} found additional wreckage—including a propeller and wheels (one {{of which}} had an intact and inflated tyre)—and noted that the wreckage was well localised, a fact which pointed to a head-on <b>impact</b> <b>with</b> the ground, and which also ruled out a mid-air explosion. Human remains were also recovered, including three torsos, a foot in an ankle boot and a manicured hand. By 2002, the bodies of five of the eight British victims had been identified through DNA testing.|$|E
5|$|In a {{volcanic}} eruption, lava, tephra (volcanic bombs, lapilli, and ash), and various gases are expelled from {{a volcanic}} vent or fissure. While many eruptions only pose dangers to the immediately surrounding area, Earth's largest eruptions {{can have a}} major regional or even global <b>impact,</b> <b>with</b> some affecting the climate and contributing to mass extinctions. Volcanic eruptions can generally be characterized as either explosive eruptions, sudden ejections of rock and ash, or effusive eruptions, relatively gentle outpourings of lava. A separate list is given below for each type.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} two linearly coupled masses, {{where one}} mass can have inelastic <b>impacts</b> <b>with</b> a fixed, rigid stop. This {{leads to the}} study of a two degree of freedom, piecewise linear, frictionless, unforced, constrained mechanical system. The system is governed by three types of dynamics: coupled harmonic oscillation, simple harmonic motion and discrete rebounds. Energy is dissipated discontinuously in discrete amounts, through <b>impacts</b> <b>with</b> the stop. We prove the existence of a nonzero measure set of orbits that lead to infinite <b>impacts</b> <b>with</b> the stop in a finite time. We show how to modify the mathematical model so that forward existence and uniqueness of solutions for all time is guaranteed. Existence of hybrid periodic orbits is shown. A geometrical interpretation of the dynamics based on action coordinates is used to visualize numerical simulation results for the asymptotic dynamics. 1...|$|R
5|$|In the 2005–06 WNCL season, Ebsary {{struggled}} to make an <b>impact</b> <b>with</b> the ball, taking four wickets at 43.00 at the relatively high economy rate of 4.91. Her figures were flattered by a haul of 3/32 in the final match of the season against Western Australia, in which she also made 26 to help seal a three-wicket win. Her batting continued to progress; she scored 149 runs at 29.80, including a best of 43 against Victoria. South Australia won five of their eight matches, again missing the finals.|$|E
5|$|In {{the view}} of Pierre Riché, the {{disappearance}} of 220 bishops' seats indicates that the Lombard migration was a crippling catastrophe for the Church. Yet according to Walter Pohl the regions directly occupied by Alboin suffered less devastation and had a relatively robust survival rate for towns, whereas the occupation of territory by autonomous military bands interested mainly in raiding and looting had a more severe <b>impact,</b> <b>with</b> the bishoprics in such places rarely surviving.|$|E
5|$|TNA X Division Champion Jay Lethal went on {{to defend}} the title in an Xscape match at Lockdown. The match was {{promoted}} on the March 13 episode of <b>Impact!,</b> <b>with</b> qualifying matches held leading up to Lockdown. The wrestlers who qualified for the bout were Shark Boy, Curry Man, Johnny Devine, Sonjay Dutt, and Consequences Creed. Lethal ended up retaining the title at the event. Lethal eventually lost the title on the April 17, 2008, episode of Impact!, when Petey Williams used his TNA X Division Feast of Fired Title shot.|$|E

David is not a frequent video game player, but stated that he has become more known for his work as the Arbiter than for his film and other voice roles.|$|E
5|$|The British {{presence}} in the Adriatic was greatly strengthened in 1809 {{with the arrival of}} the frigates HMS Amphion under William Hoste and HMS Belle Poule under James Brisbane. These reinforcements made an immediate <b>impact</b> <b>with</b> a series of raids in the Dalmatian and Ionian islands. In February Belle Poule captured the Var off Valona; the French responded by despatching the frigates Danaé and Flore from Toulon. HMS Topaze attacked these frigates as they arrived, but were able to reach Corfu before sailing north to augment French defences in the Adriatic.|$|E
5|$|The better-armoured German battlecruisers fared better, in {{part due}} to the poor {{performance}} of British fuzes (the British shells tended to explode or break up on <b>impact</b> <b>with</b> the German armour). —the only German battlecruiser lost at Jutland—had only 128 killed, for instance, despite receiving more than thirty hits. The other German battlecruisers, , Von der Tann, Seydlitz, and , were all heavily damaged and required extensive repairs after the battle, Seydlitz barely making it home, for they had been the focus of British fire for much of the battle.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{reports from}} the crash site speculated that the Amana was already on fire when it struck the tops of trees because those trees, and pieces of the aircraft's left wing torn off in the <b>impact</b> <b>with</b> them, showed signs of scorching. Several eyewitnesses reported seeing flames in the sky before the aircraft struck the ground. Department of Civil Aviation investigators discounted this speculation because {{only one of the}} Amana's push-button engine fire extinguishers had activated and this had most likely occurred during the crash or the fire.|$|E
5|$|A {{cylinder}} boot is a {{hard rubber}} or plastic cover which fits over {{the base of a}} diving cylinder to protect the paint from abrasion and impact, to protect the surface the cylinder stands on from <b>impact</b> <b>with</b> the cylinder, {{and in the case of}} round bottomed cylinders, to allow the cylinder to stand upright on its base. Some boots have flats moulded into the plastic to reduce the tendency of the cylinder to roll on a flat surface. It is possible in some cases for water to be trapped between the boot and the cylinder, and if this is seawater and the paint under the boot is in poor condition, the surface of the cylinder may corrode in those areas. This can usually be avoided by rinsing in fresh water after use and storing in a dry place. The added hydrodynamic drag caused by a cylinder boot is trivial in comparison with the overall drag of the diver, but some boot styles may present a slightly increased risk of snagging on the environment.|$|E
5|$|A.J. Styles {{went on to}} Destination X {{to defend}} the TNA X Division Championship in an Ultimate X Challenge match. An Ultimate X Challenge match has three stages. Stage one {{involves}} the four men being paired up into two tag teams and having a standard tag team match, with {{the person who is}} pinned being eliminated from the bout. Then it becomes a standard match involving three people, with the one being pinned in that phase being eliminated from the match. The final two then fight to climb the ropes and retrieve the championship that hangs in the middle. The participants were announced for the match on the March 11 episode of <b>Impact!,</b> <b>with</b> Elix Skipper and Ron Killings being added to face Styles. The final participant was determined in a match that pitted Christopher Daniels against Chris Sabin, which Daniels won. Styles would lose the championship to Daniels at the event.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{had lost}} its UK title, Razer still reigned as {{champion}} of the Extreme All-Stars tournament. Its first battle to defend this title was against twice UK champion Chaos 2 and dual-spinner 13 Black. Razer and 13 Black joined forces to eliminate Chaos 2, in what was its last ever fight on Robot Wars. Razer's next battle against Spawn Again was a rematch from the series five semi-finals. Razer was again the aggressor: it repeatedly punctured Spawn Again's body panels, prompting its constructors to seek safety by driving themselves into the pit. Razer's next battle was one-on-one versus 13 Black. Following an <b>impact</b> <b>with</b> the arena wall, 13 Black stopped spinning for long enough that Razer could lift it with the arm and lower it into the pit. In the All-Stars grand final, Razer faced Firestorm4. Razer manoeuvred its wedge underneath Firestorm4, lowered the arm and immobilised its opponent. Razer was All-Stars champion {{for a second time}} running.|$|E
5|$|An off spinner, Johnson was {{a member}} of Bradman’s first-choice team, playing in four of the five Tests before being dropped for the final rubber. He also played in the matches against Worcestershire, the MCC and Leveson-Gower's XI, where Australia {{selected}} their strongest possible team. However, Johnson was not prominent in the Test success, taking seven wickets at 61.00, his best result being 3/72 in the first innings of the Second Test. Among the five frontline bowlers used in four or more Tests, Lindwall, Miller, Toshack, Johnston and Johnson, the last had the worst average by a factor of almost two; Toshack averaged 33.09 and the others less than 23.50. Lindwall and Johnston took 27 wickets each, while Miller and Toshack took 13 and 11 respectively. Johnson’s economy rate was the second worst of the quintet and his strike rate of 156.86 was more than twice as bad as the others, with the exception of Toshack (94.46). Johnson also had little <b>impact</b> <b>with</b> the bat, scoring 51 runs at 10.20, but he did take five catches in the slips.|$|E
5|$|Battering Aitutaki {{with wind}} gusts {{in excess of}} 185km/h (115mph), Cyclone Pat devastated the island. Approximately 78percent of homes were damaged, with 72structures destroyed. The {{electrical}} grid was left completely offline and supply of water was largely lost. Agriculture also experienced tremendous <b>impact,</b> <b>with</b> most crops completely lost. Damage on Aitutaki amounted to US$13.7million; however, casualties were minimal with only eight minor injuries reported. Recovery efforts began immediately after the storm, with the Red Cross and the Government of New Zealand aiding the local government. A reconstruction plan was enacted by the Cook Islands within a month and subsequently funded by New Zealand. Owing to its destructive effects, the name Pat was later retired and replaced with Pili.|$|E
