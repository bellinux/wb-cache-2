40|$|In southeastern Australia, aeolian dust {{deposits}} {{are very}} common {{and have a}} significant influence on soil properties and soil landscapes. However, {{the characteristics of the}} pure <b>dust</b> <b>materials</b> and the rates of dust-fall in the past are unclear because of the low overall rate of dust deposition and mixing with locally derived sediments. In the Wagga Wagga region, some dunes have functioned as dust traps. Thin (< 1 cm thick) red clayey bands and thick (up to 2. 5 m) red clayey layers within the dune sequences are likely to represent illuviated aeolian <b>dust.</b> These <b>dust</b> <b>materials</b> are characterised by a bi-modal particle size distribution, one mode in the clay and another in the coarse-medium silt. The clay minerals are dominated by kaolinite, illite and smectite. Both 14 C and optical dating indicate the most recent period of dune formation was around 3 – 4 ka. In an example of these young dunes, there is a total of 2 cm equivalent thickness of <b>dust</b> <b>materials,</b> giving a deposition rate of 0. 5 – 0. 7 cm ka− 1. All three samples from an elevated dune are saturated with respect to environmental radiation dosage, and give minimum optical ages in excess of 80 ka. In this higher dune, the total thickness of dust is 50 – 80 cm, similar to that (50 – 100 cm) of the Yarabee Parna, the youngest aeolian dust deposit in the Wagga Wagga region. This may have been deposited unevenly, being more concentrated during the period 25 – 16 ka, which has been identified as a major dust deposition period in the Tasman Sea. If this variation occurred, the dust deposition rate indicated by the 50 – 80 cm <b>dust</b> <b>material</b> in the dune could have been as high as 5 cm ka− 1 for the period 25 – 16 ka.

30|$|Local near-surface {{meteorological}} {{elements and}} underlying surface conditions {{also contribute to}} the emergence of dust storms by affecting the access to <b>dust</b> <b>materials</b> (Shao and Dong 2006). Sand composition on the land surface is the material foundation of the formation of a dust storm (Lee and Sohn 2011). A dry or less-precipitation climate tends to create the conditions for the initiation of dust storms (Qian et al. 2002) and dust storms tend to appear in dry places with an annual precipitation of 25 – 300  mm (Xu and Hu 1997). In an arid or semiarid climate, the loosely held soil surface particles increase susceptibility of the area to dust storms (Cowie et al. 2013). A greater surface roughness (such as higher vegetation coverage) is likely to slow down the friction velocity and restrain the occurrence of dust storms (Mao et al. 2013). At the same time, soil moisture, soil particle size, and the stability of the underlying surface together determine the threshold wind speed needed to blow up <b>dust</b> <b>materials</b> and affect the frequency of dust storm outbreaks (Song et al. 2005; Kurosaki et al. 2011).|$|R

40|$|Recent work {{identified}} a growth barrier for dust coagulation that originates {{in the electric}} repulsion between colliding particles. Depending on its charge state, <b>dust</b> <b>material</b> may {{have the potential to}} control key processes towards planet formation such as MHD (magnetohydrodynamic) turbulence and grain growth which are coupled in a two-way process. We quantify the grain charging at different stages of disc evolution and differentiate between two very extreme cases: compact spherical grains and aggregates with fractal dimension D_f = 2. Applying a simple chemical network that accounts for collisional charging of grains, we provide a semi-analytical solution. This allowed us to calculate the equilibrium population of grain charges and the ionisation fraction efficiently. The grain charging was evaluated for different dynamical environments ranging from static to non-stationary disc configurations. The results show that the adsorption/desorption of neutral gas-phase heavy metals, such as magnesium, effects the charging state of grains. The greater the difference between the thermal velocities of the metal and the dominant molecular ion, the greater the change in the mean grain charge. Agglomerates have more negative excess charge on average than compact spherical particles of the same mass. The rise in the mean grain charge is proportional to N**(1 / 6) in the ion-dust limit. We find that grain charging in a non-stationary disc environment is expected to lead to similar results. The results indicate that the dust growth and settling in regions where the dust growth is limited by the so-called "electro-static barrier" do not prevent the <b>dust</b> <b>material</b> from remaining the dominant charge carrier.

Spitzer-IRAC ratio maps reveal that the bubble is traced by the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission following an almost circular morphology ex-cept in the south-west direction towards the low molecular density environment. The observational signatures of the collected molecular and cold <b>dust</b> <b>material</b> have been found around the bubble. We have detected 418 young stellar objects (YSOs) in the selected region around the bubble N 14. Interestingly, the detected YSO clusters are associated with the collected molecular and cold <b>dust</b> <b>material</b> on the borders of the bubble. One of the clusters is found with deeply embedded intermediate mass and massive Class I YSOs associated with one of the dense dust clumps in the east of the bubble N 14. We do not find a good agreement between the dynamical age of the H ii region and the fragmentation time of the accumulated molecular materials to explain possible “collect-and-collapse ” process around the bubble N 14. Therefore, we suggest the possibility of triggered star formation by compression of the pre-existing dense clumps by the shock wave and/or small scale Jeans gravitational instabilities in the collected materials. We have also investigated 5 young massive embedded protostars (8 to 10 M) and 15 intermediate mass (3 to 7 M) Class I YSOs which are asso-ciated with the dust and molecular fragmented clumps at the borders of the bubble.

40|$|The {{abundance}} {{evolution of}} interstellar dust species originating from stellar sources and from condensation in molecular {{clouds in the}} local interstellar medium of the Milky Way is studied and the input of <b>dust</b> <b>material</b> to the Solar System is determined. A one-zone chemical evolution model of the Milky Way for the elemental composition of the disk combined with an evolution model for its interstellar dust component {{similar to that of}} Dwek (1998) is developed. The dust model considers dust-mass return from AGB stars as calculated from synthetic AGB models combined with models for dust condensation in stellar outflows. Supernova dust formation is included in a simple parameterized form which is gauged by observed abundances of presolar dust grains with supernova origin. For dust growth in the ISM a simple method is developed for coupling this with disk and dust evolution models. The time evolution of the abundance of the following dust species is followed in the model: silicate, carbon, silicon carbide, and iron dust from AGB stars and from SNe as well as silicate, carbon, and iron dust grown in molecular clouds. It is shown that the interstellar dust population is dominated by dust accreted in molecular clouds; most of the <b>dust</b> <b>material</b> entering the Solar System at its formation does not show isotopic abundance anomalies of the refractory elements, i. e., inconspicuous isotopic abundances do not point to a Solar System origin of dust grains. The observed abundance ratios of presolar dust grains formed in SN ejecta and in AGB star outflows requires that for the ejecta from SNe the fraction of refractory elements condensed into dust is 0. 15 for carbon dust and is quite small (∼ 10 ^- 4) for other dust species.
