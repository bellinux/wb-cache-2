25|$|The names {{somatotropin}} (STH) or {{somatotropic hormone}} {{refer to the}} growth hormone produced naturally in animals and extracted from carcasses. Hormone extracted from human cadavers is abbreviated hGH. The main growth hormone produced by recombinant DNA technology has the approved generic name somatropin (INN) and the brand name Humatrope, and is properly abbreviated rhGH in the scientific literature. Since its introduction in 1992 Humatrope has been a banned sports <b>doping</b> <b>agent,</b> and {{in this context is}} referred to as HGH.|$|E
40|$|The use of <b>doping</b> <b>agents</b> {{are evident}} within {{competitive}} sport in senior and junior age groups, {{where they are}} taken by non-elite as well as elite participants. They are also taken in non-sporting contexts by individuals seeking to &# 039;improve&# 039; their physique through an increase in muscle and/or decrease in fat mass. Whilst attaining accurate data on the prevalence of their use has limitations, studies suggest the illicit use of <b>doping</b> <b>agents</b> by athletes and non-athletes may be 1 - 5 % in the population and greater than 50 % in some groups; with the prevalence being higher in males. There is conclusive evidence that some <b>doping</b> <b>agents</b> are anabolic and ergogenic. There is also evidence {{that the use of}} <b>doping</b> <b>agents</b> such as: anabolic androgenic steroids; growth hormone and other anabolic agents; erythropoietin; and stimulants conveys considerable health risks that include, but are not limited to: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, mental health issues, virilisation in women, and the suppression of naturally produced androgens in men. This review will outline the anabolic, ergogenic and health impacts of selected <b>doping</b> <b>agents</b> and methods that may be used in both the sporting and physique development contexts. It also provides a brief tabulated overview of the history of doping and how <b>doping</b> <b>agents</b> may impact upon the analyses of clinical samples...|$|R

40|$|AIMS – This study {{investigates the}} {{prevalence}} of use of <b>doping</b> <b>agents</b> and symptoms of eating disorders among patients in drug addiction treatment. The aim is also to look for characteristics of the groups reporting the use of <b>doping</b> <b>agents</b> or symptoms of eating disorders. DESIGN – A survey including questions on exercise, the use of <b>doping</b> <b>agents</b> and Eating Disorder Inventory- 2 was administered in a Norwegian drug addiction facility. The study included 109 patients in residential drug treatment, 30 females and 79 males (ranging from 17 to 50 years old). RESULTS – Symptoms of eating disorders were reported by 33 percent of the females and 7. 6 percent of the males. Previous use of <b>doping</b> <b>agents</b> (anabolic-androgenic steroids in particular) was reported by 40. 5 {{percent of the men}} and 20 percent of the women. The results are discussed in light of the theory on emotion regulation, gender and cultural expectations, drug treatment as a liminal phase and similarities to drug addiction. CONCLUSIONS – The symptoms of eating disorders and the use of <b>doping</b> <b>agents</b> are prevalent in this sample of male and female drug addicts in treatment. Drug treatment facilities should be aware of this and take the appropriate actions regarding attention, screening and treatment.

500|$|The red {{component}} of color television cathode ray tubes is typically emitted from an yttria (...) or yttrium oxide sulfide (...) host lattice doped with europium (III) cation (Eu3+) phosphors.

50|$|The PbTe {{system can}} be {{optimized}} for power generation applications by improving the power factor via band engineering. It can be doped either n-type or p-type with appropriate dopants. Halogens are often used as n-type <b>doping</b> <b>agents.</b> PbCl2, PbBr2 and PbI2 are commonly used to produce donor centers. Other n-type <b>doping</b> <b>agents</b> such as Bi2Te3, TaTe2, MnTe2, will substitute for Pb and create uncharged vacant Pb-sites. These vacant sites are subsequently filled by atoms from the lead excess and the valence electrons of these vacant atoms will diffuse through crystal. Common p-type <b>doping</b> <b>agents</b> are Na2Te, K2Te and Ag2Te. They substitute for Te and create vacant uncharged Te sites. These sites are filled by Te atoms which are ionized to create additional positive holes. With band gap engineering, the maximum zT of PbTe {{has been reported to}} be 0.8 - 1.0 at ~650K.|$|R

The sensitivity observed for different classes of prohibited substances was clearly below the value required by the World Anti-Doping Agency. In addition time-of-flight mass spectrometry gives full spectrum for all analytes without any interference from the matrix, resulting in selectivity improvements.

40|$|Using {{electrical}} resistivity rneasurernents the recovery in stage I of electron irradiated Pt has been studied.

40|$|The {{conditions}} {{for the analysis of}} selected doping substances by UHPSFC-MS/MS were optimized to ensure suitable peak shapes and maximized MS responses. A representative mixture of 31 acidic and basic <b>doping</b> <b>agents</b> was analyzed, in both ESI+ and ESI- modes. The best compromise for all compounds in terms of MS sensitivity and chromatographic performance was obtained when adding 2 % water and 10 mM ammonium formate in the CO 2 /MeOH mobile phase. Beside mobile phase, the nature of the make-up solvent added for interfacing UHPSFC with MS was also evaluated. Ethanol was found to be the best candidate as it was able to compensate for the negative effect of 2 % water addition in ESI- mode and provided a suitable MS response for all <b>doping</b> <b>agents.</b> Sensitivity of the optimized UHPSFC-MS/MS method was finally assessed and compared to the results obtained in conventional UHPLC-MS/MS. Sensitivity was improved by 5 - 100 -fold in UHPSFC-MS/MS vs. UHPLC-MS/MS for 56 % of compounds, while only one compound (bumetanide) offered a significantly higher MS response (4 -fold) under UHPLC-MS/MS conditions.

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{the prevalence of}} doping and its progression in a cohort of preadolescent athletes during a 4 -year follow-up. Design and settings: Prospective cohort study.

Main outcome measurements: Drug use (prohibited substances, tobacco, alcohol, cannabis), intention to use, reported health hazards, perceived drug effectiveness, self-esteem, trait anxiety. Results: At the beginning of the study, 1. 2 % (95 % CI 0. 8 to 1. 6) stated that they had taken <b>doping</b> <b>agents</b> at least once in the preceding 6 months, and this had risen to 3. 0 % (95 % CI 2. 3 – 3. 7) 4 years later (p, 0. 001).
