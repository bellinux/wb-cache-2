40|$|<b>Robotic</b> <b>arms</b> are {{extremely}} useful {{because they can}} carry out specific tasks with precision and efficiency. They come in many different sizes {{and can be used}} in areas such as clean room environments where they aid in the manufacturing process of semiconductors. A company known as Applied Materials bought a <b>robotic</b> <b>arm</b> that was manufactured by a Japanese company – Yaskawa. After finding an issue with the <b>robotic</b> <b>arm</b> and doing some cost-benefit analysis, the decision of donating the robot arm to the College of Engineering was made.

We will accomplish this by using the manuals that came with the <b>robotic</b> <b>arm</b> and apply our engineering skills in debugging whatever problem there is to make the <b>robotic</b> <b>arm</b> functional once again. The purpose of the documentation is {{to make it easier for}} future students or engineers to effectively operate the <b>robotic</b> <b>arm.</b> This should prevent them from having to spend large amounts of time going through the same process we are going through now. If time permits, a library of applications will be created so that the end user can operate the <b>robotic</b> <b>arm</b> even with a limited knowledge in programming.

Experimental model of robot was designed and manufactured at the Faculty of Engineering from Sibiu, (Patent no. 112418 CI 6. B 25 J 18 / 02). The Servo DC as actuator drives a reel.

40|$|Cerebral palsy {{and stroke}} are both {{debilitating}} neurological disorders that may permanently damage a person’s body movements and muscle coordination. Recent methods to help facilitate therapy in cerebral palsy patients and stroke survivors include the patient interacting with a <b>robotic</b> <b>arm</b> exoskeleton that {{is connected to}} a tablet gaming suite, which has shown to encourage the patient to complete his or her rehabilitation regiment.

40|$|Robots are {{now playing}} a very {{promising}} role in industries. Robots {{are commonly used}} in applications in repeated operations or where operation by human is either risky or not feasible. In most of the industrial applications, <b>robotic</b> <b>arm</b> manipulators are widely used. <b>Robotic</b> <b>arm</b> manipulator with two link or three link structures is commonly used due to their low degrees-of-freedom (DOF) movement. As the DOF of <b>robotic</b> <b>arm</b> increased, complexity increases. Instrumentation involved with robotics plays very important role in order to interact with outer environment. In this work, optimal control for movement of various DOFs of <b>robotic</b> <b>arm</b> using various soft computing techniques has been presented. We have discussed about different robotic structures having various DOF <b>robotics</b> <b>arm</b> movement. Further stress is on kinematics of the arm structures i. e. forward kinematics and inverse kinematics. Trajectory planning of <b>robotic</b> <b>arms</b> using soft computing techniques is demonstrating the flexibility of this technique. The performance is optimized for all possible input values and results in optimized movement as resultant output. In conclusion, soft computing has been playing very important role for achieving optimized movement of <b>robotic</b> <b>arm.</b> It also requires very limited knowledge of the system to implement soft computing techniques...|$|R
