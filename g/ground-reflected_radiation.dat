40|$|The diffuse {{radiation}} incident on an inclined plane {{is composed of}} both the <b>ground-reflected</b> <b>radiation</b> and the sky {{diffuse radiation}}. The evaluation of the sky diffuse radiation has already been described in many references. In this paper {{we focus on the}} <b>ground-reflected</b> <b>radiation,</b> its relation to insolation conditions and its evaluation by means of models. We used six data banks from the following four countries: Switzerland, France, The Netherlands, and the U. S. A. We investigated how the albedo depends on the amount and the composition of the incident radiation, on geometrical parameters such as the height and/or the azimuth of the sun and on meteorological parameters such as the humidity. We did not find any notable dependence. We also tested different models evaluating the <b>ground-reflected</b> <b>radiation</b> on tilted planes with corresponding measurements on an inverse horizontal plane (facing the ground) and on inclined planes. We came to the conservative conclusion that the best results are obtained when using a constant averaged measured albedo, for transposition to tilted surfaces, when assuming the <b>ground-reflected</b> <b>radiation</b> to be isotropic...|$|E
40|$|High-precision {{polarizing}} radiometers {{have been}} constructed for the measurement of the angular dependence of the intensity and polarization for atmospheric and <b>ground-reflected</b> <b>radiation.</b> When the data are fit with a form containing constant, first harmonic, second harmonic, and slope terms, excellent agreement with data taken with a polarizing radiometer may be obtained. A technique has been derived for rapid data reduction by using a single matrix which, when multiplied by the data values, produces the reduced values {{in the sense of}} a least-squares fit...|$|E
40|$|To {{define the}} diffuse {{radiation}} incident on an inclined plane of any orientation and of any tilt angle, {{we need to}} know sky diffuse radiation as well as <b>ground-reflected</b> <b>radiation.</b> Here we made a study of ground-reflected component of radiation on inclined surfaces with varying inclination angles for Lucknow (Latitude 26. 750, Longitude 80. 850), Mumbai (Latitude 19. 120 N, Longitude 72. 850 E), Calcutta (Latitude 22. 650 N, Longitude 88. 350 E), and Pune (Latitude 18. 530 N, Longitude 73. 910 E) cities of India using isotropic and anisotropic models. We have calculated the data for entire year using these models for all considered stations and obtained the percentage contributions in diffuse radiations. It is found that anisotropic model predict lower values than isotropic and contribution of ground-reflected component in diffuse radiation for isotropic model is more than anisotropic...|$|E
40|$|Parasitic {{waveguide}} element suppresses <b>ground-reflected</b> multipath <b>radiation.</b> Small {{section of}} waveguide {{placed in front}} of phased-array antenna operating at 850 MHz modifies radiation field by reducing power density parallel to and below ground plane without significantly affecting primary radiation at angles greater than 20 degrees above horizontal. Acts as parasitic radiator that shifts phase of portion of wavefront by approximately 180 degrees, causing partial cancellation in ground plane, thereby reducing radiation intensity in that direction by about 10 dB. Produces corresponding reduction in multipath radiation scattered from ground. Waveguide technique also used to decouple two nearby antennas...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a statistical approach for {{the estimation of}} the diffuse/global irradiation on various inclined surfaces from the measured data of horizontal surface. In fact diffuse solar radiation on an inclined plane consists of two components: sky diffuse radiation and reflected radiation from the ground. For analyzing estimation of the daily tilted sky diffuse component from the daily horizontal diffuse irradiance, we have considered six models Badescu, Circumsolar, Skartveit and Olseth, Hay, Klucher and Liu and Jordan (Isotropic). All these models except Badescu adopted the same methodology for estimating the <b>ground-reflected</b> <b>radiation</b> component, therefore, only sky diffuse component was analyzed at Lucknow (latitude 26. 75 Â°, longitude 80. 50 Â°), India location. Statistical analysis showed that the Skartveit and Olseth model gives good prediction for the low inclination angle however; Klucher model gave better performance for highly inclined south-facing surfaces. The Root Mean Square Errors (% RMSE) value varies from 3. 45 % to 24. 15 % except for Badescu and Circumsolar model which predict worse results. In general, Klucher's model provides close agreement with the measurements. Diffuse irradiation Inclined surfaces Reflected radiation...|$|E
