5|$|The largest {{terrestrial}} lizard of {{the archipelago}} of Puerto Rico is the Mona <b>ground</b> <b>iguana</b> (Cyclura cornuta stejnegeri). A subspecies of the rhinoceros iguana (Cyclura cornuta), it is endemic to Mona Island, {{located in the}} Mona Passage between the main island of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. Another Cyclura species of similar size, the Anegada <b>ground</b> <b>iguana</b> (Cyclura pinguis), once occurred in the archipelago but it became extirpated due to predation by dogs, cats, and humans, habitat destruction, and competition from goats and pigs, and is now restricted to Anegada. The most common lizard in Puerto Rico is the sharp-mouthed lizard (Anolis pulchellus). The Anolis lizards of Puerto Rico, and the Greater Antilles in general, represent an interesting case of adaptive radiation. Anolis lizards in the Greater Antilles are {{more closely related to}} other species within the same island than to species of adjacent islands. Surprisingly, even though species divergence occurred independently on each island, the same set of ecomorphs (habitat specialists) have evolved on each island.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategy}} proved successful, {{according to}} Alberts, when the released head-started iguanas reacted to predators, foraged for food, and behaved like their wild-born counterparts. This {{strategy has been}} implemented with great success with other critically endangered species of Cyclura and Ctenosaura throughout the West Indies and Central America, notably the Jamaican iguana, Grand Cayman blue iguana, Ricord's iguana, Allen Cays iguana, Acklins <b>ground</b> <b>iguana,</b> and Anegada iguana.|$|E
5|$|The fauna of Puerto Rico {{has been}} {{subjected}} to human influence since the arrival of the Ortoiroid, Puerto Rico's first settlers, approximately 4,000 years ago. The native fauna was used by the island's indigenous population as a source of food, while others were used for skins and trade. Significant declines in the populations and diversity of the islands fauna are believed to have begun after the arrival of European settlers in the sixteenth century. Habitat destruction, primarily as a result of forest clearing for sugar cane plantations, had a devastating effect on Puerto Rican fauna during {{the latter half of the}} nineteenth century. Furthermore, human-introduced species such as rats, cats, the small Asian mongoose, and the cane toad have had a profound effect on the native fauna of Puerto Rico. Rats on Monito Island are believed to be a limiting factor on the abundance of the endemic Monito gecko, feral cats on Mona Island have been documented attacking common ground doves and endemic reptiles, and have been associated with the reduction of Mona <b>ground</b> <b>iguana</b> juveniles, and mongooses have been documented preying on Puerto Rican parrot fledgings.|$|E
2500|$|Mona <b>ground</b> <b>iguanas</b> are diurnal {{and spend}} most of the day basking in the sun conserving energy. [...] Mona <b>ground</b> <b>iguanas</b> are endemic to Mona Island, Puerto Rico. They are {{scattered}} through the entire island, though the Southwest part of the island is only used during the nesting season. They live a considerable portion of their lives underground, and are usually found in talus slopes, caves and sinkhole depressions. The average depth underground that they can be found is 1.5 metres.|$|R
25|$|Natural {{populations of}} Acklins <b>ground</b> <b>iguanas</b> are found only on Fish Cay and North Cay in the Acklins Bight, Bahamas. They {{formerly}} inhabited Long (Fortune) Cay. An additional introduced population with five founding individuals was established {{on a small}} cay in the early 1970s.|$|R
25|$|The {{primary reason}} for the Anegeda <b>ground</b> <b>iguana's</b> decline is {{competitive}} grazing with domestic and feral livestock. The secondary reason {{is that they are}} preyed upon by feral dogs and cats. As with other Rock Iguanas, their habitat is also in rapid decline due to development and logging.|$|R
25|$|Cyclura ricordi, {{commonly}} known as the Hispaniolan <b>ground</b> <b>iguana,</b> Ricord's <b>ground</b> <b>iguana,</b> Ricord's iguana, or Ricord's rock iguana, is a critically endangered species of rock iguana. It is found on the island of Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic), and is the only known species of rock iguana to coexist with the rhinoceros iguana (Cyclura cornuta). Its natural habitat is dry savanna within three subpopulations in the southwestern Dominican Republic. It is threatened by habitat loss due to agricultural encroachment.|$|E
25|$|The Acklins <b>ground</b> <b>iguana</b> is {{endemic to}} three small cays in the Bahamas and is {{described}} as endangered according to the current IUCN Red List.|$|E
25|$|The Mona <b>ground</b> <b>iguana</b> (Cyclura cornuta stejnegeri) is a {{subspecies}} of the rhinoceros iguana (Cyclura cornuta). It is {{endemic to}} Mona Island, Puerto Rico {{and is the}} largest native terrestrial lizard in Puerto Rico.|$|E
2500|$|Although Mona <b>ground</b> <b>iguanas</b> use {{the whole}} island as their habitat, only 1% of the territory, {{located on the}} {{southwest}} coast, is suitable for nesting because it contains loose sand and receives direct sunlight. The females bury their eggs {{in the sand and}} the sunlight incubates the eggs. [...] Males reach sexual maturity at a size of 28–31cm in length from snout to vent, usually in their third to fourth year, while females mature one year later at a size of 35–40cm.|$|R
25|$|The land fauna is characterised by the {{presence}} of numerous <b>ground</b> <b>iguanas.</b> On this small territory live the green iguana of South America (the heraldic symbol of the municipality of Terre-de-Haut) and the endemic species of the Antilles, Iguana delicatissima, which is threatened by the appearance of a hybrid stemming from the reproduction between the both species. Other reptiles live with these prehistoric saurians: the Terre-de-Haut racer (Alsophis sanctonum sanctonum), Terre-de-Bas racer (Alsophis sanctonum danforthi), Les Saintes anole (Anolis terraealtae - strictly endemic to the archipelago), and lot of species of anoles. To be found throughout the hill are agoutis (Dasyprocta noblei), rodents of South America and the Caribbean; goats which populate woods and the edges of beaches; and, well hidden, some species of stick insects (praying mantises).|$|R
40|$|Throughout the Greater Antilles, the Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, the Bahama Islands, and the Turks and Caicos islands occurs a {{group of}} {{moderate}} to very large lizards of the iguanid genus Cyclura. These <b>ground</b> <b>iguanas</b> form a conspicuous element of the herpetofaunas of their respective islands. In some areas, the <b>ground</b> <b>iguanas</b> are still very abundant, in others somewhat less so, and in still others they have either become recently extinct or are known only from fossils. Fourteen species are currently recognized, with the largest percentage occurring in the Bahamas Islands. There has been no recent taxonomic treatment of the genus. That of BARBOUR & NOBLE (1916) was the only systematic study, and these authors were very greatly hampered by far from adequate material of many taxa. They examined a total of 22 specimens and named four species, each {{on the basis of}} a single individual. We on the other hand have examined 378 preserved specimens. As might be presumed, the characteristics which BARBOUR & NOBLE employed to distinguish species are not always confirmed when longer series of specimens are studied. Accordingly, diagnoses of species of Cyclura may not easily be made solely {{on the basis of a}}bsolute differences in head scutellation or other scale features – the amount of variation in any series is often so great that we have found it impossible to maintain several currently recognized species on absolute scale differences. Rather, scale modalities have been used in part to diagnose taxa. In addition, color and pattern of both adults and juveniles (especially the latter) reveal relationships which would perhaps be more obscure if these data were not available. Nevertheless, there are many problems remaining within the genus, and we feel that our treatment of the various taxa may well be modified as more material is accumulated. We have adhered to a via media in our taxonomic treatment; we have described no new subspecies (although in some cases there are differences which in other iguanid genera suggest subspeciation) but on the other hand we have maintained all names presently in use (although in some cases the subspecies remain rather poorly defined). We have not hesitated to express our opinions in the soundness of our own interpretations in these cases. We have been able to examine such a large quantity of specimens only through the cooperation of the curatorial personnel at several museums, both in the United States and abroad. There exist many other specimens of Cyclura in American collections which we deliberately did not choose to examine; these specimens are often with imprecise locality or other data and are lizards that died in public or private collections and were later preserved. Much of the material we have examined is in the collection of the senior author (Albert Schwartz Field Series – ASFS); specimens formerly in the collection of the junior author have now been catalogued in the ASFS. Between us, we have seen living examples of all but four taxa which we recognize herein...|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to the nominate race (Cyclura cornuta cornuta) found on Hispaniola, {{there are two other}} subspecies of Cyclura cornuta, the Mona <b>ground</b> <b>iguana</b> (Cyclura cornuta stejnegeri) and the Navassa Island iguana (Cyclura cornuta onchiopsis), although the latter subspecies is believed to be extinct in the wild.|$|E
25|$|The Anegada <b>ground</b> <b>iguana</b> or stout iguana (Cyclura pinguis) is a {{critically}} endangered species of lizard {{of the genus}} Cyclura belonging to the family Iguanidae. The species can be found exclusively in the islands of Anegada and Guana. Historically, it inhabited the islands of Puerto Rico and Saint Thomas, however, the animal's original range has been greatly diminished.|$|E
25|$|Like all Cyclura species the Acklins <b>ground</b> <b>iguana</b> is {{primarily}} herbivorous, 95% of which from consuming leaves, flowers and fruits from 7 different plant {{species such as}} seaside rock shrub (Rachicallis americana), and erect prickly pear (Opuntia stricta). This diet is very rarely supplemented with animal matter, although a wild specimen has been recorded eating mice.|$|E
25|$|The Anegada <b>ground</b> <b>iguana</b> {{is noted}} {{as the oldest}} species of Cyclura and the most genetically {{divergent}} of the West Indies' rock iguanas. An ancestor to this iguana first dispersed to Hispaniola, then onwards {{to the north and}} western islands, which has since diversified on different islands into the 9 species and several additional subspecies of the genus Cyclura as we know it today.|$|E
25|$|Like all Cyclura species the Anegada <b>ground</b> <b>iguana</b> is {{primarily}} herbivorous, consuming leaves, flowers and fruits from different plant species. However, due to direct competition with grazing livestock in its native habitat such as sheep, goats, burros, and cattle {{they have been}} reduced to eating vegetation rejected by these domestic and feral animals. This has also caused them to become opportunistic carnivores preying upon centipedes, millipedes, roaches, insects, and other invertebrates as opposed to being strict herbivores.|$|E
500|$|The Cuban rock iguana (Cyclura nubila), {{also known}} as the Cuban <b>ground</b> <b>iguana</b> [...] or Cuban iguana, is a species of lizard of the iguana family. It is the largest of the West Indian rock iguanas (genus Cyclura), one of the most {{endangered}} groups of lizards. This herbivorous species with red eyes, a thick tail, and spiked jowls {{is one of the largest}} lizards in the Caribbean.|$|E
2500|$|The Anegada <b>ground</b> <b>iguana</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by American Herpetologist Thomas Barbour 1917. Its generic name (Cyclura) {{is derived from}} the Ancient Greek cyclos(κύκλος) meaning [...] "circular" [...] and ourá(οὐρά) meaning [...] "tail", after the thick-ringed tail characteristic of all Cyclura iguanas, {{with the exception of the}} Anegada <b>ground</b> <b>iguana.</b> [...] Its specific name pinguis means [...] "fat" [...] and refers to the animal's stocky appearance and the common name [...] "Stout iguana".|$|E
2500|$|The Acklins <b>ground</b> <b>iguana</b> is a {{recognized}} subspecies of the San Salvador Rock Iguana, recognized as such since 1975. [...] The species {{is listed as}} endangered according to the current IUCN Red List.|$|E
2500|$|Cyclura rileyi nuchalis, {{commonly}} known as the Acklins <b>ground</b> <b>iguana</b> or [...] Watling Island iguana, is an endangered [...] subspecies of lizard of the genus Cyclura it is one of three subspecific forms of Cyclura rileyi in the family Iguanidae.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{every other}} species of Cyclura the Acklins <b>ground</b> <b>iguana</b> is free of threats by feral predators. [...] The cays they dwell on are remote and human populations leave the animals undisturbed. [...] Natural predators {{in the form of}} ospreys, herons, kestrels and seagulls have minimal impact on the populations.|$|E
2500|$|Feral pigs {{pose the}} most serious threat as they root up iguana nests, and like most Cyclura species, the Mona <b>ground</b> <b>iguana</b> nests communally and at high density. [...] Introduced goats and pigs are a major {{competitor}} for food and overbrowsing by goats also leads to loss of protective cover from birds of prey such as the osprey and predation of juveniles by feral cats.|$|E
2500|$|Mona is a mainly flat plateau {{surrounded}} by sea cliffs. It {{is composed of}} dolomite and limestone with many caves found throughout. [...] With an arid climate and untouched by human development, many endemic species inhabit the island, such as the Mona <b>ground</b> <b>iguana</b> (Cyclura cornuta stejnegeri). Its topography, ecology, and modern history are {{similar to that of}} Navassa Island, a small limestone island located in the Jamaica Channel, between Jamaica and Haiti.|$|E
2500|$|The Mona <b>ground</b> <b>iguana</b> is a large-bodied, heavy-headed lizard {{with strong}} legs and a {{vertically}} flattened tail which {{is capable of}} reaching 1.22 metres in length (from snout to tail). [...] A crest of pointed, horned scales extends from the {{nape of the neck}} to the tip of the tail. [...] The color is a uniform gray to olive drab with slight brown or blue colorations. Juveniles differ from adults in that they have gray transverse bands across their bodies. These bands last until they are sexually mature at about three years of age.|$|E
2500|$|The island {{presently}} {{serves as}} a retreat for Puerto Ricans and nature enthusiasts {{from all around the}} world, and has also become a popular destination for Puerto Rican Boy and Girl Scouts. Due to the islands' unique topography, ecology and location, Mona, Desecheo and Monito have been nicknamed [...] "The Galápagos Islands of the Caribbean". Scientists, ecologists, and students have visited Mona Island to explore its distinct ecosystem, which includes the endemic Mona <b>Ground</b> <b>Iguana.</b> The island is also home to many cave drawings that were left behind by the island's original inhabitants. Remains of the guano mining industry can also be seen.|$|E
2500|$|The Acklins <b>ground</b> <b>iguana</b> {{strongly}} {{resembles the}} San Salvador rock iguana {{in color and}} shape. [...] The lizard's back color can range from red, orange or yellow, to green, brown or grey, usually patterned by darker markings. The very brightest colors (red, orange or yellow) are normally only displayed by males and are more pronounced which at warmer body temperatures. Immature iguanas lack these bright colors, being either solid brown or grey with faint slightly darker stripes. What makes this iguana {{stand out from the}} other two subspecies is the scalation on its neck and head.|$|E
2500|$|The Anegada <b>ground</b> <b>iguana</b> {{has also}} been {{successfully}} bred in captivity at the San Diego Zoo and the Fort Worth Zoo. Both zoos have actively {{been working with the}} British Virgin Islands on a joint-recovery program started in 1997 on Anegeda Island. 120 iguanas have been raised at the facility for release into the wild. Hatchlings are fed and protected so they can be [...] "headstarted" [...] for the wild and not fall prey to feral dogs and cats. This offsets the juvenile mortality rate and is accompanied by field research, nestsite protection, and monitoring of released animals.|$|E
2500|$|The Anegada <b>ground</b> <b>iguana</b> {{is a large}} {{heavy-bodied}} rock iguana which attains a {{total body}} length of close to 22inches(560mm). [...] As juveniles they are faintly or boldly patterned with wide gray to moss green bands interspersed with wide gray to black anteriorly directed chevrons. These bands fade and are generally lost as the animals mature, turning a uniform grayish or brownish-black with varying amounts of turquoise on the dorsal spines, tail base, fore and hind legs. Occasionally this bluish coloration extends up onto {{the sides of the}} individual, particularly in males. Females tend to be relatively dull in color, exhibiting less brilliant blue if any.|$|E
2500|$|A headstarting {{program was}} put into place by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources with {{cooperation}} from the IUCN Iguana Specialist Group, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the Toledo Zoo, and the University of Puerto Rico in 1999 {{to aid in the}} recovery of the Mona <b>ground</b> <b>iguana.</b> [...] From within the safety of this program, the iguanas are reared until they are large enough to survive in the wild, and predators such as the pigs and feral cats are no longer a threat. [...] The facility also carries out health screening prior to the release of specimens. [...] This health screening has been used to provide baselines of the normal physiologic values of the species, identifying potential future problems due to parasites, diseases, etc. which might threaten the population.|$|E
2500|$|The Mona <b>ground</b> <b>iguana</b> is a {{subspecies}} of rhinoceros iguana {{belonging to}} the genus Cyclura. It was named by Thomas Barbour and G.K. Noble as a species in 1916. In 1937, Barbour considered {{it to be a}} subspecies of Cyclura cornuta. Its generic name (Cyclura) is derived from the Ancient Greek cyclos(κύκλος) meaning [...] "circular" [...] and ourá(οὐρά) meaning [...] "tail", after the thick-ringed tail characteristic of all Cyclura. [...] The Mona ground iguana's specific name, cornuta, is the feminine form of the Latin adjective cornutus, meaning [...] "horned" [...] and refers to the horned projections on the snouts of males of the species. [...] Its subspecific name, stejnegeri honors Leonhard Hess Stejneger, who, when writing his Herpetology of Porto Rico in 1902, suspected this was a new species.|$|E
2500|$|There are 500 {{species of}} {{reptiles}} (94% {{of which are}} endemic). Islands are inhabited by some endemic species such as rock iguanas and American crocodile. The blue iguana, endemic to the island of Grand Cayman, is endangered. The green iguana is invasive to Grand Cayman. [...] The Mona <b>ground</b> <b>iguana</b> which inhabits the island of Mona, Puerto Rico, is endangered. The rhinoceros iguana from the island of Hispaniola which is shared between Haiti and the Dominican Republic is also endangered. The region has several types of sea turtle (loggerhead, green turtle, hawksbill, leatherback turtle, Atlantic ridley and olive ridley). Some species are threatened with extinction. Their populations have been greatly reduced since the 17th century – the number of green turtles has declined from 91million to 300,000 and hawksbill turtles from 11million to less than 30,000 by 2006.|$|E
2500|$|Mona ground iguanas, {{like most}} Cyclura ssp. are {{primarily}} herbivorous, consuming leaves, flowers, berries, and fruits from different plant species. [...] A study in 2000 by Dr Allison Alberts of the San Diego Zoo revealed that seeds {{passing through the}} digestive tracts of Cycluras germinate more rapidly than those that do not. [...] These seeds in the fruits consumed by Cyclura have an adaptive advantage by sprouting {{before the end of}} very short rainy seasons. [...] The Mona <b>ground</b> <b>iguana</b> is also an important means of distributing these seeds to new areas (particularly since females migrate to nesting sites) and, as the largest native herbivores of their ecosystems, they are essential for maintaining the balance between climate and vegetation. [...] Their diets are very rarely supplemented with insect larvae, crabs, slugs, dead birds, and fungi; individual animals do appear to be opportunistic carnivores. [...] Fewer than a dozen animal species and 71 plant species are found in the Mona ground iguanas' diets. [...] Mona ground iguanas eat the caterpillar of sphingid moths. [...] These larvae feed on poisonous plants and are aposematically colored and avoided by other predators.|$|E
