40|$|Of {{the many}} known stoichiometries and crystal phases of {{manganese}} oxide, {{a select few}} {{have been found to}} have remarkable properties for electrochemical <b>charge</b> <b>storage.</b> Among these are hollandite α-MnO 2 and spinel λ-MnO 2, which are studied in this work. α-Mn O 2 has been observed to have a high electrochemical <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> capacity with incredible rate capability and cycle lifetime in aqueous alkali salt electrolytes. In these conditions, this material also exhibits the unique property of pseudocapacitance, meaning that the electrochemical behavior mimics the properties of a parallel-plate dielectric capacitor. However, the underlying mechanism for <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> in α-MnO 2, and the origins of pseudocapacitance are generally not understood. Conversely, λ-MnO 2 is a well-studied cathode for lithium ion batteries with a high capacity and rate for <b>charge</b> <b>storage,</b> which is known to degrade quickly, especially at elevated temperatures. In this work, we study both pseudocapacitive Mn O 2 and λ-MnO 2 using computational chemistry and experimental techniques. Computationally, the <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> properties of these two materials are framed within a band-diagram and electronic structure framework to elucidate the e_ect of physical properties such as band gap, work function, point of zero charge, and pH on <b>charge</b> <b>storage.</b> Experimentally, thicknesses up to 200 nm of MnO grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) are converted by electrochemical treatment into pseudocapacitive NaMn 4 O 8 and spinel LiMn 2 O 4. By studying the electrochemical properties of pseudocapacitive NaMn 4 O 8 and spinel LiMn 2 O 4 at varying thicknesses, a more detailed mechanistic understanding for <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> in each material is established. This powerful combination of theoretical and experimental techniques provides a detailed picture of <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> in these materials, which can be extended to other electrochemical <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> materials...|$|R
40|$|The <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> in the a-Si:H PIN {{photodiode}} {{under different}} light wavelength illuminations has been studied. The leakage current-voltage and capacitance-voltage curves under three fundamental visible light wavelengths, i. e., red, {{green and blue}} light were measured. The apparent <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> density in the negative voltage range was quantified from the capacitance-voltage curve; charges in the positive voltage range were estimated from the leakage current-voltage curve. The measurement was verified with a pre-fabricated circuit which is a <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> readout device. The diode under the long wavelength light illumination condition stored more charges than that under the short wavelength light illumination condition because the former could penetrate the intrinsic a-Si:H layer deeper than the latter could. The leakage current and <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> capacity of the diode {{are determined by the}} generation of electron-hole pairs and the depletion of charges in the intrinsic layer as well as the supply of charges from the electrodes. A comparison of <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> capacities of diodes with different intrinsic layer thicknesses is also presented. The number of photogenerated carriers increases with the thickness of the i-layer due to the long penetration depth, but the junction capacitance decreases which results in the decrease of the <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> capacity. The tradeoff between the photogenerated carriers and the capacitance, combined with thickness-dependent recombination mechanisms increases the complexity of the PIN diode <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> capacity. The n+- and p+-contact region should be heavily doped so that the <b>storage</b> <b>charge</b> can be confined in the i-layer without diffusing and recombining in the contact region. The n+ and p+ films, prepared by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) {{of a wide range of}} doping concentration, were fabricated to achieve low bulk resistivity and ohmic contacts with the metal electrodes. <b>Charge</b> <b>storage</b> density was improved after the optimization doped layers in both positive gate voltage and negative gate voltage.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Understanding {{the dynamic}} <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> in {{nanoporous}} electrodes with room-temperature ionic liquid electrolytes {{is essential for}} optimizing them to achieve supercapacitors with high energy and power densities. Herein, we report coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of the cyclic voltammetry of supercapacitors featuring subnan-ometer pores and model ionic liquids. We show that the cyclic charging and discharging of nanopores are governed by the interplay between the external field-driven ion transport and the sloshing dynamics of ions inside of the pore. The ion occupancy along the pore length depends strongly on the scan rate and varies cyclically during charging/discharging. Unlike that at equilibrium conditions or low scan rates, <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> at high scan rates is dominated by counterions while the contribution by co-ions is marginal or negative.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Using {{molecular}} dynamics simulations, {{we show that}} <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> in subnanometer pores follows a distinct voltage-dependent behavior. Specifically, at lower voltages, <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> is achieved by swapping co-ions in the pore with counterions in the bulk electrolyte. As voltage increases, further <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> is due mainly to the removal of co-ions from the pore, leading to a capacitance increase. The capacitance eventually reaches a maximum when all co-ions are expelled from the pore. At even higher electrode voltages, additional <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> is realized by counterion insertion into the pore, accompanied by a reduction of capacitance. The molecular mechanisms of these observations are elucidated and provide useful insight for optimizing energy storage based on supercapacitors.

40|$|Metal oxide–carbon {{architectures}} (CNTs, graphene, fullerenes, carbon spheres, etc.) {{have been}} widely studied due to their outstanding <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> properties. In this study, we have investigated the <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> mechanism in TiO 2 coated CNTs. TiO 2 nanoparticles are anchored to functionalized multiwalled CNTs via controlled hydrolysis of titanium(IV) isopropoxide. The composite architecture thus produced was composed of uniformly coated TiO 2 particles (size ranging from 10 – 30 nm) around the CNTs' surface. The Li-ion storage in TiO 2 coated CNTs was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge experiments. Galvanostatic cycling illustrates a high capacity of 470 mA h g� 1 for the composite electrode, a value higher than the theoretical specific capacity (335 mA h g� 1) of anatase TiO 2. Electrochemical analysis using CV measurements indicates the total <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> value observed is the cumulative response of diffusion controlled and non-diffusion controlled processes.

There is a need for identification and development of alternative low-cost, high energy, high-power materials for widespread implementation of supercapacitor technologies. Nanostructured vanadium nitride (VN) coated with a thin vanadium oxide (VOx) surface layer has previously been identified to be a very promising electrode material for supercapacitor application. In this work, attempt was made to develop a fundamental understanding of the supercapacitor response of both the nitride and oxide nanomaterials. In order to understand the <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> behavior of the nitride nanomaterials, both the materials and electrode properties were altered to understand the exact role of each aspect on the <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> characteristics. Using a combination of solid state and wet-chemical methods a number of nitride materials were synthesized and via a thorough materials and electrochemical characterization, a fundamental understanding of the structure-property relationships in the nitride materials was obtained. The roles of particle size, electronic conductivity, and electrode thickness and most importantly, the surface oxide nature are also explored in this work. The investigations conducted in the nitride systems made it clear that the prodigious amount of <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> in nitride nanomaterials was primarily due to a surface oxide layer and that the stabilization and improvement in electronic conductivity of the surface oxide was pivotal in attaining a reversible and stable <b>charge</b> <b>storage.</b> Nanostructured oxides of vanadium (VOx) as standalone supercapacitor materials were therefore explored.
