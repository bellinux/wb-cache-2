5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of 23 November 2007, within a span of 25 minutes, six consecutive serial blasts occurred in the Lucknow, Varanasi, and Faizabad courts, in which 28 {{people were killed and}} several others injured. The blasts came a week after the Uttar Pradesh police and central security agencies busted Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists who had planned to abduct Rahul Gandhi. The Indian Mujahideen has claimed responsibility for these blasts in an email sent to TV stations five minutes before the blast. The first blast occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>premises</b> of the Varanasi civil court and collectorate between 13:05 and 13:07. Two successive blasts occurred in the Faizabad district court around 13:12 and 13:15, closely followed by one at Lucknow at 13:32. Bombs were explicitly targeted at the lawyers who were working in the courts.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{took place}} on the streets of Kolkata, where Ghosh often {{employed}} the art of guerrilla filmmaking (shooting in real locations without any previous knowledge given to onlookers) to avoid unwanted attention. The cinematographer Setu, who had assisted others in the past to shoot documentaries in Kolkata, said that unlike majority of Indian films, Kahaani was shot mostly without artificial light. The film was shot in 64 days, during which the Durga Puja festival of 2010 took place. Shooting locations in Kolkata included Kalighat Metro station, Nonapukur tram depot, Kumartuli, Howrah Bridge, Victoria Memorial, old houses of North Kolkata and others. The climax, which takes place on the night of Vijayadashami (the last day of Durga Puja), was shot on the night of Vijayadashami <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>premises</b> of a Barowari (publicly organised) Durga Puja celebration in the Ballygunge neighbourhood of Kolkata. Most of the crowd in the climax were not actors. Some actors mingled with the crowd engaged in Sindoor khela—their job was to appreciate the camera angles and accordingly apply sindoor (vermilion) on Vidya's face so that accidental exposure of her eyes to sindoor could be avoided.|$|E

5|$|Paul meets an old friend, Kim Taylor (Jenny Young), and learns he is {{the father}} of her sons David (Takaya Honda) and Leo Tanaka (Tim Kano). Paul and Kim manage to stop Amy and Leo from consummating their relationship. David bonds with Paul soon after, {{although}} Leo stays away from him due to their business rivalry, but eventually comes to accept Paul as his father. Paul tries to pursue a relationship with Terese, but she rejects him and later gets engaged to Gary. After receiving compensation from the Quill group, Paul buys and moves back into the Lassiter's Penthouse, with Amy and Jimmy. Terese confides in Paul that she has breast cancer, and he does his best to support her. However, once it is obvious that her chemotherapy is not working, Terese visits her brother Nick in prison, who is later granted bail with the help of Clive Gibbons (Geoff Paine), much to Paul's chagrin. Paul soon learns that Amy and Nick are dating. In addition, Paul and Leo are bought out of Robinsons after Amy encourages Steph to help Nick set up a wellness centre <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>premises.</b> Paul and Terese have sex, but she chooses to stay with Gary. After attempting to give Nick money to leave town, Paul frames him by having someone plant stolen medication in Nick's hotel room, resulting in his parole being revoked. Amy is furious to discover that Paul has set Nick up, and when Paul does not confess his crime to the police, she and Jimmy move back into No. 26. After Terese makes it clear that she and Paul will never be in a relationship, and Amy refuses to move back into the penthouse, Paul decides to leave Erinsborough for a few weeks supposedly to visit his family in New York City, but David reveals that Paul never arrived. Paul returns a few weeks later and reveals he is engaged to Courtney Grixti (Emma Lane). He also buys Mr Udagawa's (Lawrence Mah) share of Lassiters making him Terese's boss.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} the computational complexity of evaluating nested counterfactuals over a propositional knowledge base. A counterfactualp>qis a conditional query {{with the meaning}} “Ifpwould be true <b>in</b> <b>the</b> knowledge base, would it then hold that alsoqis true,” which is different from material implicationp⇒q. A nested counterfactual is a counterfactual statement where the premisepor the conclusionqis a counterfactual. Statements of the formp 1 >(p 2 …(pn>q) …) intuitively correspond to conditional queries involving a sequence of revisions. We show that evaluating such statements isΠP 2 -complete and that this task becomes PSPACE-complete if negation is allowed in a nesting of this form. We also consider nesting a counterfactual <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise,</b> i. e., (p>q) >r, and show that evaluating such statements isΠP 4 -complete, thus most likely much harder than evaluatingp>(q>r). Finally, we also address iterated nestings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> and <b>the</b> mix of nestings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> and <b>the</b> conclusion...|$|R

40|$|Inferences {{are assumed}} as {{processes}} which one draws some conclusions from <b>the</b> given <b>premises.</b> <b>The</b> inferences which have category terms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> and <b>the</b> conclusion statements are called category-based inferences. The inferences that <b>the</b> category levels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conclusion {{are the same}} as or higher than those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> are called category-based inductions. The purpose of this experiment was {{to examine the effects of}} typicality of premise instances and level of conclusion instances on kindergartners' and second graders' categorybased inductions. For the animal task the subjects were taught the novel information to the typical instances (an elephant and a giraffe) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> statement, "An elehpant and a giraffe have hemoguro inside. " Then they were presented three conclusion statements one by one and asked to judge whether the novel information was true for each conclusion statement, "Does a lion (basic instance) have hemoguro inside as an elephant and a giraffe?", "Does an animal (intermediate instance) have hemoguro inside as an elephant and a girafe?", and "Does a living thing (superordinate instance) have hemoguro inside as an elephant and a giraffe?" <b>The</b> atypical instances <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> statement were a beaver and a mole, and the novel word was adorena. For the fruit task the typical instances were an apple and a banana, and the novel word was pekuchin. The atypical instances were a fig and a pomegranate, and the novel word was serurosu. The conclusion sinstances were an orange (basic), fruits (intermediate), and food (superordinate). When the subjects responded with "Yes" to the conclusion statemerits, they are assumed to have drew the category-based induction. (a) The typicality effect was defined as the case which the subjects drew more induetion with <b>the</b> typical <b>premise</b> instances than with the atypical ones. This effectwas found only for second graders, especially on <b>the</b> basic conclusion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two tasks and on <b>the</b> intermediate conclusion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fruit task. The findings were discussed with reference to category similarity and category membership <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> and <b>the</b> conclusion instances. The typicality effect was not found for kindergartners. (b) With ascending category levels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conclusion instances, second graders' induction on <b>the</b> typical <b>premise</b> instances became difficult <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two tasks, which were discussed with reference to category similarity, category membership, and category-term production.

25|$|Inductive {{reasoning}} contrasts {{strongly with}} deductive reasoning in that, {{even in the}} best, or strongest, cases of inductive reasoning, {{the truth of the}} premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. Instead, the conclusion of an inductive argument follows with some degree of probability. Relatedly, the conclusion of an inductive argument contains more information than is already contained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>premises.</b> Thus, this method of reasoning is ampliative.|$|E
