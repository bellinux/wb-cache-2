In August, the Pirates asked Ellis to pitch in the bullpen; he refused on consecutive nights. On August 15, 1975, Ellis refused assignment to the bullpen again; as a result, the Pirates suspended him for one day. Ellis called for a team meeting the next day, where he was expected to apologize. Instead, he berated Murtaugh, who responded by cursing at Ellis, ordering the pitcher out of the clubhouse and attempting to fight him. Coach Don Leppert reportedly also tried to fight Ellis. The Pirates suspended Ellis for thirty days and fined him $2,000. The suspension was lifted on August 30 when Ellis apologized to Murtaugh.|$|E
5|$|Locusts are {{eaten in}} the Arabian Peninsula, {{including}} Saudi Arabia, where consumption of locusts spiked around Ramadan {{especially in the}} Al-Qassim Region in 2014, since many Saudis believe they are <b>healthy</b> <b>to</b> eat; however, the Saudi Ministry of Health warned that pesticides they used against the locusts made them unsafe; and Kuwait. Yemenis also consume locusts, and expressed discontent over governmental plans to use pesticides to control them. ʻAbd al-Salâm Shabînî described a locust recipe from Morocco. 19th century European travellers observed Arabs in Arabia, Egypt, and Morocco selling, cooking, and eating locusts. They reported that in Egypt and Palestine locusts were consumed. They reported that in Palestine, around the River Jordan, in Egypt, in Arabia, and in Morocco that Arabs ate locusts, while Syrian peasants did not eat locusts.|$|E
5|$|The film {{presents}} {{examples of}} crowd psychology and collective behavior {{which can lead}} to mass hysteria and the loss of social order. The bafflement, outrage, and helplessness associated with the lack of information, combined with new media such as blogs, allow conspiracy theorists like Krumwiede to spread disinformation and fear, which become dangerous contagions themselves. Dr. Cheever must balance the need for full disclosure but avoid a panic and allow the time to characterize and respond to an unknown virus. The movie indirectly critiques the greed, selfishness, and hypocrisy of isolated acts in contemporary culture and the unintended consequences they can have {{in the context of a}} pandemic. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends social distancing by forcibly isolating the <b>healthy</b> <b>to</b> limit the spread of the disease, which stands in stark opposition to contemporary demands for social networking. Responding to the pandemic presents a paradox, as the contagiousness and lethality of the virus instills deep distrust of others but surviving and limiting the spread of the disease also requires individuals to work together.|$|E

25|$|People with BPD {{can be very}} {{sensitive}} to the way others treat them, by feeling intense joy and gratitude at perceived expressions of kindness, and intense sadness or anger at perceived criticism or hurtfulness. Their feelings about others often shift from admiration or love to anger or dislike after a disappointment, a threat of losing someone, or a perceived loss of esteem {{in the eyes of}} someone they value. This phenomenon, sometimes called splitting, includes a shift from idealizing others to devaluing them. Combined with mood disturbances, idealization and devaluation can undermine relationships with family, friends, and co-workers. Self-image can also change rapidly from <b>healthy</b> <b>to</b> unhealthy.|$|E

40|$|The {{treatment}} of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is currently undergoing assessment and revisions to improve pregnancy outcomes of GDM women. Previous studies focused on finding new strategies {{to decrease the}} incidence of GDM complications, however, there is insufficient evidence supporting strategies that enhance adherence <b>to</b> <b>healthy</b> lifestyle behaviors among women with GDM. The purpose of this pre-test and post-test comparative experimental study (control vs. intervention) is {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of a health education intervention on improving gestational diabetes women’s self-efficacy for adherence <b>to</b> <b>healthy</b> behaviors and ability for adherence <b>to</b> <b>healthy</b> behaviors. This study was conducted at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital between October 2016 and January 2017, among Omani women with GDM. Standard prenatal care was received by the control group, the intervention group received an additional health education session and a biweekly text messages for 4 weeks. Different self-efficacy enhancing strategies (e. g., motivational messages, role modeling, goal setting, and mastery experiences) were used to encourage women to maintain the recommended healthy behaviors. Total of ninety GDM women completed both the pre-test and post-test. At baseline, no significant variances between study groups in relation to self-efficacy for adherence <b>to</b> <b>healthy</b> behaviors (t= 1. 14, p=. 62) and adherence <b>to</b> <b>healthy</b> behaviors (t= -. 80, p=. 23) were found. At post-test, the intervention group reported significant improvement in the self-efficacy score (M= 9. 89, SD= 19. 58) in comparison to the control group (M= - 1. 84, SD= 17. 58); t (88) = - 2. 99, p<. 001). The improvement in self-efficacy for adherence <b>to</b> <b>healthy</b> behaviors was not a significant predictor for the improvement in adherence <b>to</b> <b>healthy</b> behaviors (B=. 01, SE=. 01, p=. 08), controlling for the group. However, it was found that the improvement in self-efficacy for adherence <b>to</b> <b>healthy</b> behaviors partially mediates the relationship between the group assignment and the improvement in adherence <b>to</b> <b>healthy</b> behaviors. While physical limitations was the primary barrier for adherence <b>to</b> <b>healthy</b> behaviors, participants’ concern of GDM-related complications was the top motivator for adherence <b>to</b> <b>healthy</b> behaviors. The findings from this study demonstrate that the health education intervention significantly improved gestational diabetes women’s self-efficacy for adherence <b>to</b> <b>healthy</b> behaviors and their ability for adherence <b>to</b> <b>healthy</b> behaviors. Improved adherence <b>to</b> <b>healthy</b> behaviors should reflect in decreased incidence of GDM-related complications. Future examination of the data is planned that will study its effect on improving pregnancy outcomes of Omani pregnant women with gestational diabetes. Upcoming research should focus on preventing incidence of gestational diabetes through lifestyle modification interventions that incorporates self-efficacy as motivational strategy to improve adherence <b>to</b> <b>healthy</b> behaviors...|$|R
