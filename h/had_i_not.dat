Now it was of my acquaintance, that inasmuch as God had let me be born a prince, such as I then am born, then my good and my destruction were knotted into one with the common good; for every reason then, it was now my promise that I should take great pains about their well-being and good governance and management, and thereabout bear close concern.|$|E
500|$|Balzac's {{vision of}} {{a society in which}} class, money and {{personal}} ambition are the key players has been endorsed by critics of both left-wing and right-wing political persuasions. Marxist Friedrich Engels wrote: [...] "I have learned more [...] than from all the professional historians, economists and statisticians put together". Balzac has received high praise from critics as diverse as Walter Benjamin and Camille Paglia. He was also praised by James Baldwin, who said 1984: [...] "I’m sure that my life in France would have been very different <b>had</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> met Balzac. [...] the way that country and its society works." [...] In 1970 Roland Barthes published S/Z, a detailed analysis of Balzac's story Sarrasine and a key work in structuralist literary criticism.|$|E

500|$|In early February {{the marquis}} arrived back unannounced {{at his house}} in Rio de Janeiro, much to the {{surprise}} of his wife. The Viscount of Inhaúma also returned home shortly afterwards, but with his health so compromised that he died a few weeks later. Upon learning of Inhaúma's death, Caxias said: [...] "and the same would have had happened to me, <b>had</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> resolved {{to get out of that}} hell." [...] PedroII was greatly disappointed in Caxias, but he was also very aware that the marquis was the person most responsible for the great successes during the war, accomplishments that had come at the cost of years of sacrifice and personal bravery. The Emperor called the marquis to the Imperial Palace, the Paço de São Cristóvão, on 21 February 1869 for a reconciliation.|$|E
500|$|A hadith records that, {{when the}} second Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab (580–644) came to kiss the stone, he said {{in front of all}} assembled: [...] "No doubt, I know that you are a stone and can neither harm anyone nor benefit anyone. <b>Had</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> seen Allah's Messenger [...] kissing you, I would not have kissed you." [...] However, in the hadith {{collection}} Kanz al-Ummal, it is recorded that Ali responded to Umar, saying, [...] "This stone (Hajar Aswad) can indeed benefit and harm. ... Allah says in Quran that he created human beings from the progeny of Adam and made them witness over themselves and asked them, 'Am I not your creator?' Upon this, all of them confirmed it. Thus Allah wrote this confirmation. And this stone has a pair of eyes, ears and a tongue and it opened its mouth upon the order of Allah, who put that confirmation in it and ordered to witness it to all those worshippers who come for Hajj." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{continued}} to write prose {{during the period}} of her marriage. During the winter of 1883, whilst her husband was in Ceylon, she worked on a series of memoirs of her childhood home, with a view to publishing them under the title An Emigrant's Notebook, but this plan was abandoned. She wrote a series of pamphlets in 1887 called Over the River, in which she appealed for funds for the parish of St. Stephens in Southwark, south London. She also wrote a number of short stories in the years 1890 and 1891, although these also never appeared in print. A number of unpublished poems from this period have also survived. When Sir William Gregory died in March 1892, Lady Gregory went into mourning and returned to Coole Park; there she edited her husband's autobiography, which she published in 1894. She was to write later, [...] "If I had not married I should not have learned the quick enrichment of sentences that one gets in conversation; <b>had</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> been widowed I should not have found the detachment of mind, the leisure for observation necessary to give insight into character, to express and interpret it. Loneliness made me rich—'full', as Bacon says." ...|$|E

500|$|While the {{portions}} of the episode focusing on Joan, Peggy, and Sally were critically acclaimed, some critics were mixed {{on the value of}} the dream sequence. One writer for Zap2it declared the episode one of the best episodes yet. Alan Sepinwall, writing for Hitfix said that the episode was [...] "full of nightmares and self-realizations" [...] as well as [...] "horrifying images". Sepinwall wrote that the [...] "only way the strangulation scene would have been acceptable to me was with the understanding going in that it was a dream. Had the show not telegraphed that — or <b>had</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> figured it out — and Don woke up the next morning with no corpse on the floor, I'd have been irked." [...] One writer for Paste Magazine noted that the [...] "brilliantly shot" [...] episode had a [...] "Hitchcockian feel", and pointed to the use of [...] "reverse point-of-view shots" [...] and [...] "close-ups of hands on doorknobs that added an air of suspense not usually present on Mad Men." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN declared it the [...] "best episode yet for Season 5, with some very good material for Joan, Peggy, Don and Sally packed into a busy hour." [...] Goldman praised the resolution to the Harris marriage, crediting Weiner with mastering [...] "the slow burn on this show, and it was just so gratifying to finally have this issue be dealt with." ...|$|E

2500|$|Humbert Humbert's first love, Annabel Leigh, {{is named}} after the [...] "maiden" [...] in the poem [...] "Annabel Lee" [...] by Poe; this poem is alluded to {{many times in the}} novel, and its lines are {{borrowed}} to describe Humbert's love. A passage in chapter 11 reuses [...] Poe's phrase ...by the side of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride. In the opening of the novel, the phrase Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, exhibit number one is what the seraphs, the misinformed, simple, noble-winged seraphs, envied, is a pastiche of two passages of the poem, the winged seraphs of heaven (line 11), and The angels, not half so happy in heaven, went envying her and me (lines 21–2). Nabokov originally intended Lolita to be called The Kingdom by the Sea, drawing on the rhyme with Annabel Lee that was used in the first verse of Poe's work. A variant of this line is reprised in the opening of chapter one, which reads ...<b>had</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> loved, one summer, an initial girl-child. In a princedom by the sea.|$|E
2500|$|Milward Kennedy in {{his review}} in The Guardian of 21 September 1934 said after {{summarising}} the set-up of the plot that, [...] "Poirot has no part in this book; instead, {{a young man and}} a young woman who blend charm and irresponsibility with shrewdness and good luck contrive amusingly and successfully to usurp the functions of the police. The fault which I find is the overimportance of luck. For the villains it was, for example, singular good luck which enabled them to discover and identify an obscure vicar's fourth son asleep on a solitary picnic; it was very bad luck for them {{that he was able to}} assimilate a sixteenth times fatal dose of morphia. They were lucky, again, in having always at hand just the properties required to make an extempore murder seem something else; and as for the Bright Young Couple – but these are defects which are little noticeable in the gay stream of Mrs. Christie's narrative. Perhaps I should not have noticed them <b>had</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> read the book so quickly that, in a secluded village, there was nothing for it next day but to read it again with a sterner eye but no less enjoyment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Third, {{it appears}} likely that Spinoza {{had already taken}} the {{initiative}} to separate himself from the Talmud Torah congregation and was vocally expressing his hostility to Judaism itself. He had probably stopped attending services at the synagogue, either after the lawsuit with his sister or after the knife attack on its steps. He might already have been voicing the view expressed later in his Theological-Political Treatise that the civil authorities should suppress Judaism as harmful to the Jews themselves. Either for financial or other reasons, he had in any case effectively stopped contributing to the synagogue by March 1656. He had also committed the [...] "monstrous deed," [...] contrary to the regulations of the synagogue and the views of some rabbinical authorities (including Maimonides), of filing suit in a civil court rather than with the synagogue authorities—to renounce his father's heritage, no less. Upon being notified of the issuance of the censure, he {{is reported to have}} said: [...] "Very well; this does not force me to do anything that I would not have done of my own accord, <b>had</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> been afraid of a scandal." [...] Thus, unlike most of the censure issued routinely by the Amsterdam congregation to discipline its members, the censure issued against Spinoza did not lead to repentance and so was never withdrawn.|$|E
