That is {{all we have to}} <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>put</b> ourselves at his disposal...is an extremely important message.

2500|$|Facing the {{possibility}} of defeat in the 2012 Presidential election the Obama Administration accelerated work {{in the weeks before}} the election to develop explicit rules for the targeted killing of terrorists by unmanned drones, so that a new president would inherit clear standards and procedures.

With a continuing debate about the proper limits of drone strikes, Obama did not want to leave an [...] "amorphous" [...] program to his successor, the official said. The effort, which would have been rushed to completion by January had Mitt Romney won, will now be finished at a more leisurely pace, the official said.

[...] U.S. President Obama also expressed wariness of the powerful temptation drones pose to policy makers. [...] "There's a remoteness to it that makes it tempting to think that somehow we can, without any mess on our hands, solve vexing security problems," [...] he said.|$|E
