500|$|Several former {{intelligence}} officials described the attack as emotionally distressing for the spy agency. Former CIA deputy director John E. McLaughlin said: [...] "It is the nightmare we've been anticipating since {{we went into}} Afghanistan and Iraq." [...] Bruce Hoffman, a professor at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, characterized the assault as a serious reversal in NATO's war efforts. Former CIA Counterterrorism Chief Robert Grenier described the attack as the Taliban equivalent of a precision <b>guided</b> <b>weapon.</b> [...] "This attack is something {{that will never be}} forgotten in Langley, Virginia," [...] said Jack Rice, who formerly worked as a CIA officer in Afghanistan.|$|E
2500|$|An {{anti-tank}} missile (ATM), {{anti-tank guided missile}} (ATGM), anti-tank <b>guided</b> <b>weapon</b> (ATGW) or anti-armor <b>guided</b> <b>weapon</b> is a guided missile primarily designed to hit and destroy heavily armored military vehicles. ATGMs {{range in size from}} shoulder-launched weapons which can be transported by a single soldier, to larger tripod-mounted weapons which require a squad or team to transport and fire, to vehicle and aircraft mounted missile systems. The introduction of smaller, man-portable ATGMs such as the Dragon and Javelin with larger warheads to the modern battlefield has given infantry the ability to defeat light and medium tanks at great ranges, though main battle tanks using composite and reactive armors have proven to be resistant to smaller ATGMs. Earlier infantry anti-tank weapons such as anti-tank rifles, {{anti-tank missile}}s and magnetic anti-tank mines had limited armor-penetration abilities and/or required a soldier to approach the target closely.

2500|$|Following bombing {{difficulties}} in Operation Desert Storm, the Air Force sought an all-weather [...] "smart" [...] bomb that could work regardless of smoke, fog, dust, and cloud cover, with research, development, testing and evaluation (RDT) of an [...] "adverse weather precision guided munition" [...] beginning in 1992. Several proposals were considered, including a radical concept that used GPS. [...] To identify the technical {{risk associated with}} an INS/GPS <b>guided</b> <b>weapon,</b> the Air Force created in early 1992 a rapid-response High Gear program called the [...] "JDAM Operational Concept Demonstration" [...] (OCD) at Eglin Air Force Base. Honeywell, Interstate Electronics Corporation, Sverdrup Technology, and McDonnell Douglas were hired to help the 46th Test Wing demonstrate the feasibility of a GPS weapon within one year. The OCD program fitted a GBU-15 guided bomb with an INS/GPS guidance kit and on 10 February 1993, dropped the first INS/GPS weapon from an Air Force F-16 on a target [...] downrange. Five more tests were run in various weather conditions, altitudes, and ranges. The OCD program demonstrated an 11-meter Circular Error Probable (CEP).|$|E

The Bristol GW team was vulnerable, and two attempts to eliminate it were made. A Bloodhound I missile was rapidly modified to CW guidance and intercepted and destroyed the target aircraft. The other contractors had not reached this stage, so the Bristol Bloodhound II was developed for the Royal Air Force, Sweden and Switzerland. Its advanced features gave it a very long service life.|$|E
