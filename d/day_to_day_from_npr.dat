60|$|On {{one point}} {{connected}} with the watch she kept on Mr Boffin, she felt very inquisitive, {{and that was the}} question whether the Secretary watched him too, and followed the sure and steady change in him, as she did? Her very limited intercourse with Mr Rokesmith rendered this hard to find out. Their communication now, at no time extended beyond the preservation of commonplace appearances before Mr and Mrs Boffin; and if Bella and the Secretary were ever left alone together by any chance, he immediately withdrew. She consulted his face when she could do so covertly, as she worked or read, and could make nothing of it. He looked subdued; but he had acquired a strong command of feature, and, whenever Mr Boffin spoke to him in Bella's presence, or whatever revelation of himself Mr Boffin made, the Secretary's face changed no more than a wall. A slightly knitted brow, that expressed nothing but an almost mechanical attention, and a compression of the mouth, that might have been a guard against a scornful smile--these she saw <b>from</b> morning <b>to</b> night, <b>from</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>day,</b> <b>from</b> week <b>to</b> week, monotonous, unvarying, set, as in a piece of sculpture.|$|R

For all this space of time, through the frosts and snows and fogs of winter, through the icy winds of spring, and now deep {{into the heart of}} summer, the city of Haarlem had been closely beleaguered by an army of thirty {{thousand}} Spaniards, most of them veteran troops under the command of Don Frederic, the son of Alva, and other generals. Against this disciplined host were opposed the little garrison of four thousand Hollanders and Germans aided by a few Scotch and English soldiers, together with a population of about twenty thousand old men, women and children. <b>From</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>day,</b> <b>from</b> week <b>to</b> week, from month to month, the struggle was waged between these unequal forces, marked on either side by the most heroic efforts and by cruelties that would strike our age as monstrous.

For fishing is like life; and in the art of living, too, there are duffers, though they seldom give us their confessions.

60|$|And {{here is the}} {{conclusion}} to which I lead you. Something more is needed {{if we are to}} get forward. There lies the function of the Liberal Party. Liberalism supplies at once the higher impulse and the practicable path; it appeals to persons by sentiments of generosity and humanity; it proceeds by courses of moderation. By gradual steps, by steady effort <b>from</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>day,</b> <b>from</b> year <b>to</b> year, Liberalism enlists hundreds of thousands upon the side of progress and popular democratic reform whom militant Socialism would drive into violent Tory reaction. That is why the Tory Party hate us. That is why they, too, direct their attacks upon the great organisation of the Liberal Party, because they know it is through the agency of Liberalism that society will be able in the course of time to slide forward, almost painlessly--for the world is changing very fast--on to a more even and a more equal foundation. That is the mission that lies before Liberalism. The cause of the Liberal Party is the cause of the left-out millions; and because we believe that there is in all the world no other instrument of equal potency and efficacy available at the present time for the purposes of social amelioration, we are bound in duty and in honour to guard it from all attacks, whether they arise from violence or from reaction.|$|R

40|$|We report {{photometric}} and spectroscopic {{observations of}} the SU UMa-type dwarf novae, KS Ursae Majoris, during its 2003 February superoutburst. Modulations with a period of 0. 07017 ± 0. 00021 day, which is 3. 3 % larger than the orbital period, have been found during the superoutburst and may be positive superhumps. A maximum trough-to-peak amplitude of around 0. 3 magnitude is determined for this superhump. The spectra show broad, absorption-line profiles. The lines display blue and red troughs which alternate in depth. The radial velocity curve of the absorption wings of Hβ has an amplitude of 40 ± 11 km s − 1 and a phase offset of 0. 12 ± 0. 03. The γ velocity of the binary is 3 ± 9 km s − 1 and varies on an order of 50 km s − 1 <b>from</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>day.</b> <b>From</b> another clear evidence for a precessing eccentric disk, we obtain a solution to an eccentric outer disk consistent with theoretical works, which demonstrates {{the validity of the}} relation between superhumps and tidal effects.

Therefore, the whole disk is eccentric and the variation of γ velocity and the evolutionary asymmetric line profiles could be criterions for an precessing eccentric accretion disk.
