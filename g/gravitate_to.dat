5|$|A {{design team}} {{was formed in}} 1946 under the {{leadership}} of chief designer Ronald Bishop, who had been responsible for the Mosquito fighter-bomber. A number of unorthodox configurations were considered, ranging from canard to tailless designs; all were subsequently rejected. The Ministry of Supply was, however, interested in the most radical of the proposed designs and ordered two experimental tailless DH 108s to serve as proof of concept aircraft for testing swept-wing configurations in both low-speed and high-speed flight. During flight tests, the DH 108 gained a reputation for being accident-prone and unstable, leading de Havilland and BOAC to <b>gravitate</b> <b>to</b> conventional configurations and, necessarily, designs with less technical risk. The DH 108s were later modified to test the DH 106's power controls.|$|E
25|$|Long {{duration}} bonds {{tend to be}} mean reverting, {{meaning that}} they readily <b>gravitate</b> <b>to</b> a long-run average. The middle of the curve (5–10 years) will see the greatest percentage gain in yields if there is anticipated inflation even if interest rates have not changed. The long-end does not move quite as much percentage-wise because of the mean reverting properties.|$|E
25|$|Theistic schools {{believe in}} cycles of creations where souls <b>gravitate</b> <b>to</b> {{specific}} bodies {{in accordance with}} karma, which as an unintelligent object depends on the will of God alone. For example, Kaushitaki Upanishad 1.2 asserts that birth in different forms of existence as a worm, insect, fish, bird, lion, boar, snake or a human, is determined by a person's deeds and knowledge.|$|E

25|$|Another {{issue in}} Ybor City after World War II was {{the aging of}} the area’s housing stock. New {{construction}} had all but stopped during the Depression and the war, and thousands of homes built during the neighborhood's era of rapid growth around 1900 were still in use. These old wooden structures were becoming dilapidated and were thus not particularly attractive to first-time home buyers such as returning veterans, who tended to <b>gravitate</b> <b>to</b> West Tampa or the booming suburbs of Tampa.|$|E
25|$|Argentine youth {{began to}} musically and {{socially}} <b>gravitate</b> <b>to</b> either the suburban rock groups or towards the underground. And even within these two major groupings there were subdivisions (rolinga and post-chabón in suburban rock; sonico, punk, {{dark in the}} underground). Then there were the heavy metal followers, the large and expanding indie scene, and the tropical rock followers, genre increasingly intermixed with the fledgling Cumbia which would explode in the new millennium. The pieces were {{in place for the}} current period of rock in Argentina.|$|E
25|$|Appayya Dikshita, a Shaiva theologian and {{proponent of}} Shiva Advaita, states that Shiva only awards {{happiness}} and misery {{in accordance with}} the law of karma. Thus persons themselves perform good or evil actions according to their own inclinations as acquired in past creations, and in accordance with those deeds, a new creation is made for the fulfilment of the law of karma. Shaivas believe that there are cycles of creations in which souls <b>gravitate</b> <b>to</b> specific bodies in accordance with karma, which as an unintelligent object depends on the will of Siva alone.|$|E

25|$|MILESTONES program {{objective}} is to facilitate a transformation in the juvenile offender’s behavior from delinquent and addictive to pro-social and healthy. The program staff and treatment team develop individual and community strategies to help eliminate and/or manage undesirable behaviors and reinforce those that are socially acceptable with positive outcomes. The JCC–L program model incorporates mentoring, cognitive restructuring, social learning, and cause and effect reinforcement. JCC-L recognizes that most juvenile offenders, including those who are lower functioning, still possess a level of reasoning, response, {{and the ability to}} identify simple patterns. These juvenile offenders also possess the necessary tools to facilitate self-change. Consistent with cognitive theory, the expressed thoughts and beliefs of the juvenile offenders are tracked over time to establish patterns of thinking. Cognitive interventions target both beliefs and thoughts, identify those with positive and negative ultimate outcomes, and subsequently facilitate a change in behavior. In addition to providing alternative coping skills and competencies, the Milestone program also reduces risk levels. Any idea, belief, or circumstance which causes a juvenile to <b>gravitate</b> <b>to</b> inappropriate/illegal behavior is a risk factor.|$|E
500|$|Carol Kaye {{provided}} {{an exception to}} the predominantly male world of Los Angeles session work in the 1960s. [...] Originally a guitarist, she began doing session work in Los Angeles in the late 1950s, playing behind Ritchie Valens on [...] "La Bamba" [...] and in the 1960s becoming a regular contributor on Phil Spector's recordings as well as on Beach Boys songs, such as [...] "Help Me, Rhonda" [...] and their subsequent Pet Sounds and Smile LPs. [...] Ray Pohlman, who had assumed an early leadership position in the Wrecking Crew, became the musical director for the Shindig! TV show in 1965, resulting in reduced studio work from that point on. [...] After Pohlman's move to television, Kaye began to <b>gravitate</b> <b>to</b> the electric bass. [...] She supplied the signature bass line in Sonny and Cher's [...] "The Beat Goes On" [...] released in 1967. [...] Joe Osborn played bass on numerous Wrecking Crew-backed songs, such as Glen Campbell's [...] "By the Time I Get to Phoenix", The Mamas & the Papas' [...] "California Dreamin'", Richard Harris' [...] "MacArthur Park", and the 5th Dimension's [...] "Up, Up and Away". [...] Other notable electric bassists who played with the Wrecking Crew were Bill Pitman, Max Bennett, Red Callender, Chuck Rainey, and Bob West, as well as Jimmy Bond, Lyle Ritz, Chuck Berghofer, who played acoustic upright bass.|$|E
500|$|After {{appearing}} on the show in series 6, Richard Herring wrote on his blog: [...] "What a delightful and fascinating programme this is (and one that I think might benefit from an extended podcast release - two hours of material is recorded for the 27 minute show and it's pretty much all gold!). At times I was so enjoying listening to the others talking that I almost forgot that I {{was meant to be}} taking part. It was a wide-ranging discussion taking in ants on stilts, pianists with crippling, mechanical little fingers, the changing meridian and okapi sex (can you guess what I contributed?). The show has a dedicated team of nerds behind it who have dug out amazing facts and I love the way it has a panel comprising comedians, scientists and experts and attempts to link each contribution to similar areas of the different disciplines. While most TV panel shows (including to some extent even QI) <b>gravitate</b> <b>to</b> putting in the same well-known comedy faces, you get a lot more interesting stuff by mixing it up a bit. The zoologist, Dr Christofer Clemente, came up with the funniest lines of the show. But would they book him on Mock The Week? It's intelligent and stimulating programming that is increasingly being edged out of TV and even radio, leaving a gaping open goal for independent internet productions to score in. I discussed this with one of the razor-minded team after the show. The TV companies insist on getting big names into all shows, which takes up all the budget and seems to ignore the fact that the pool of possible contributors gets smaller and more boring. But glad that a few shows designed to expand the mind rather than crush the spirit still exist." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the bottom}} of society were the [...] "masterless men" [...] and women (who lacked a clear social {{relationship}} with a social superior, such as service or apprenticeship) the unemployed and vagrants, whose numbers were swelled in times of economic downturn or hardship. Masterless women may have made {{up as much as}} 18 per cent of all households and particularly worried authorities. In rural society those that needed relief from extreme hardship tended from the lowest ranks of rural society, including cottars, labourers and servants. Most of those who took to the roads, around three quarters, were men. Most had a disability such as blindness, or claimed to have suffered a personal disaster such as fire or theft. Some were discharged soldiers and sailors, probably returning home or searching for work. Most tended to move around a restricted area, probably moving between a limited number of parishes in search of work and relief. For some this may have been tied to the agricultural calendar, and individuals may have moved in a circuit as different foodstuffs and work became available. Poor relief was more abundant in urban centres, particularly in the largest centres like Edinburgh. As a result, particularly in times of extreme hardship the poor would <b>gravitate</b> <b>to</b> the burghs. They could form a large section of society, with roughly a quarter of population of Perth in 1584 being classified as poor. The poor in urban society were a diverse group, the largest numbers women and most of those were widows. In Aberdeen in the period 1695–1705 three-quarters of the poor who received relief were women and of those two thirds were widows. The remainder were made up of servants, casual labourers, journeymen artisans, beggars, vagrants and orphans.|$|E

Some of our folksong exponents seem to think you have to go way back in the hills and drag out the worst singer in the world before it's authentic.

2500|$|Phase 1- It {{exists only}} once {{and is the}} pre-paradigm phase, {{in which there is}} no {{consensus}} on any particular theory.

2500|$|Tom Roland, {{from the}} Country Music Association International, {{explains}} country music's global popularity: [...] "In this respect, at least, Country Music listeners {{around the globe}} {{have something in common}} with those in the United States. In Germany, for instance, Rohrbach identifies three general groups that <b>gravitate</b> <b>to</b> the genre: people intrigued with the American cowboy icon, middle-aged fans who seek an alternative to harder rock music and younger listeners drawn to the pop-influenced sound that underscores many current Country hits." [...] One of the first Americans to perform country music abroad was George Hamilton IV. He was the first country musician to perform in the Soviet Union; he also toured in Australia and the Middle East. He was deemed the [...] "International Ambassador of Country Music" [...] for his contributions to the globalization of country music. Johnny Cash, Emmylou Harris, Keith Urban, and Dwight Yoakam have also made numerous international tours. The Country Music Association undertakes various initiatives to promote country music internationally.|$|E
2500|$|The cost-price of new output was {{not based}} on a {{hypothetical}} [...] "labor-value" [...] of inputs, but {{based on what the}} producers actually paid for the inputs that were used up to create their outputs. The difference between the selling price and the cost price of the new output sold, was the surplus value realized as profit by the producer of that output, and the argument was, that this profit would normally (assuming ordinary competition) tend to <b>gravitate</b> <b>to</b> an amount reflecting the average profit rate on capital. If businesses could not reach a baseline profitability, they would be driven out of business sooner or later, or they would be taken over by another business and restructured, so that they did become sufficiently profitable. Inversely, if businesses overcharged for their commodities to obtain more profit, fewer people would buy them, and they would suffer decline as well. Marx then examined what the division of the total newly produced surplus value would be, among producers with varying capital compositions, on the assumption of a uniform profit rate established by free competition.|$|E

2500|$|The reply of TSSI theorists is, basically, {{that the}} concept of {{equilibrium}} itself is confused with (1) the concept of continual (and haphazard) market adjustment, and (2) the concept of socio-economic stability. [...] Supply and demand may continually adjust to each other without ever being in equilibrium, other than momentary coincidences, and the lack of a perfect match between supply and demand does not necessarily prevent social stability, as long as enough workers turn up for work each working day to produce more capital. Capitalist equilibrium means [...] "business as usual" [...] for capitalists, and [...] "back to work" [...] for workers. But [...] "business as usual" [...] does not mean market balance. Disequilibrium is precisely the life of the market, and equilibrium is the life that the market observably never had. Marx himself had never argued that capitalist society is [...] "held together" [...] or [...] "balanced out" [...] by the market; instead, what held society together was the relations of production, i.e. the mutual dependencies arising out of the necessity to produce and reproduce human life co-operatively, within the framework of a system of property rights enforced by the state. Thus, a consistent Marxian theory of prices and profits is claimed to be possible, without assuming that the market, the economy or the society spontaneously <b>gravitate</b> <b>to</b> an [...] "equilibrium state" [...] of economic harmony through the [...] "price mechanism". In this view, the idea of equilibrium is itself poorly conceptualized by economists, and given a magical, arcane power which it does not really have, once we understand the conjuror's trick.|$|E
