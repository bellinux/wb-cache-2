40|$|Accumulation of {{particles}} {{in a high}} concentration on a microchannel wall is a common phenomenon in a colloidal fluid. Gradual accumulation/deposition {{of particles}} can eventually obstruct the fluid flow and lead to clogging, which seriously affects the accuracy and reliability of nozzle-based printing and causes damage to the nozzle. Particle accumulation in a 100 μm microchannel was investigated by light microscopy, and its area growth in an <b>exponential</b> <b>format</b> was used to quantify this phenomenon. The effects of the constriction angle and alginate concentration on particle accumulation were also studied. In {{order to reduce the}} clogging problem, an acoustic method was proposed and evaluated here. Numerical simulation was first conducted to predict the acoustic radiation force on the particles in the fluid with different viscosities. Interdigital transducers (IDTs) were fabricated on the LiNbO 3 wafer to produce standing surface acoustic waves (SSAW) in the microchannel. It was found that the actuation of SSAW can reduce the accumulation area in the microchannel by 2 to 3. 7 -fold. In summary, the particle accumulation becomes significant with the increase of the constriction angle and fluid viscosity. The SSAW can effectively reduce the particle accumulation and postpone clogging...|$|E
40|$|A {{computational}} framework for modelling damage-induced softening in fibre-reinforced materials is presented. The main {{aspect of this}} framework is the proposed non-local gradient-enhanced continuum damage formulation. At the material level, the elastic constitutive behavior is defined by a hyperelastic functional including a volumetric and an isochoric contribution. The isochoric contribution is subdivided into three contributions associated to three different phases i= 0, 1, 2. Phase 0 is represented by an incompressible neo-Hookean material, whereas phases 1 and 2 are represented by an <b>exponential</b> <b>format</b> that accounts for the stretching along two preferred anisotropy directions, i. e. two fibre families. Furthermore, a 1 -di-type damage function, is introduced to reproduce the loss of stiffness in each phase i. Following the ideas discussed in Dimitrijeciv and Hackl (2008) Waffenschmidt et al. (2014), and references cited therein, the model is built around the enhancement of the local free energy function by means of terms that contain the referential gradients of the non-local damage variables ϕ(symbol) i The inclusion of these terms ensures an implicit regularisation of the finite element implementation. A finite element implementation of the non-local gradient-enhanced continuum damage model is presented. To this end we develop an 8 -noded Q 1 Q 1 P 0 hexahedral element following a variational approach, in order to efficiently model the quasi-incompressible behaviour of the hyperelastic material. This element is implemented in Abaqus {{by means of a}} user subroutine UEL. Three boundary value problems are studied: an anisotropic plate with a hole, a balloon angioplasty and a full- 3 D artery-like tube. These computational experiments serve to illustrate the main capabilities of the proposed model...|$|E
