5|$|Fractals are {{infinitely}} self-similar, <b>iterated</b> mathematical constructs having fractal dimension. Infinite iteration is {{not possible}} in nature so all 'fractal' patterns are only approximate. For example, the leaves of ferns and umbellifers (Apiaceae) are only self-similar (pinnate) to 2, 3 or 4 levels. Fern-like growth patterns occur in plants and in animals including bryozoa, corals, hydrozoa like the air fern, Sertularia argentea, and in non-living things, notably electrical discharges. Lindenmayer system fractals can model different patterns of tree growth by varying {{a small number of}} parameters including branching angle, distance between nodes or branch points (internode length), and number of branches per branch point.|$|E

He added smaller features like sound effects and music, conveyor belt animations, and scorekeeping, but each new feature brought new software bugs to address. To make the game more interesting, Cook added the gumball bombs and tweaked the mechanism that caught them. He <b>iterated</b> through prototypes including a player-controlled claw and an item that traversed the pipes before finally deciding on crosshairs for the player to fire. Cook also added the game's time limit and the differences between levels. Closer to the end, Cook coded Gumball title page and the animated transitions between levels.|$|E

5|$|Classical {{music was}} brought to the United States with some of the first colonists. European {{classical}} music is rooted in the traditions of European art, ecclesiastical and concert music. The central norms of this tradition developed between 1550 and 1825, centering on {{what is known as the}} common practice period. Many American classical composers attempted to work entirely within European models until late in the 19th century. When Antonín Dvořák, a prominent Czech composer, visited the United States from 1892 to 1895, he <b>iterated</b> the idea that American classical music needed its own models instead of imitating European composers; he helped to inspire subsequent composers to make a distinctly American style of classical music. By the beginning of the 20th century, many American composers were incorporating disparate elements into their work, ranging from jazz and blues to Native American music.|$|E
5|$|Directed pseudoforests and endo{{function}}s are in {{some sense}} mathematically equivalent. Any function ƒ from a set X to itself (that is, an endomorphism of X) {{can be interpreted as}} defining a directed pseudoforest which has an edge from x to y whenever ƒ(x) = y. The resulting directed pseudoforest is maximal, and may include self-loops whenever some value x has ƒ(x) = x. Alternatively, omitting the self-loops produces a non-maximal pseudoforest. In the other direction, any maximal directed pseudoforest determines a function ƒ such that ƒ(x) is the target of the edge that goes out from x, and any non-maximal directed pseudoforest can be made maximal by adding self-loops and then converted into a function in the same way. For this reason, maximal directed pseudoforests are sometimes called functional graphs. Viewing a function as a functional graph provides a convenient language for describing properties that are not as easily described from the function-theoretic point of view; this technique is especially applicable to problems involving <b>iterated</b> functions, which correspond to paths in functional graphs.|$|E
5|$|In May 1937, the Committee noted two {{attacks on}} the patrol's ships in the Balearic islands by Spanish Republican Air Force aircraft, the first on the Italian cruiser Barletta and the second on German pocket {{battleship}} Deutschland.

Germany and Italy said they would withdrawn from the Committee, and from the patrols, unless it could be guaranteed {{there would be no}} further attacks. Early June saw the return of Germany and Italy to the committee and patrols. Italian reticence of operations in Spain, however, was dropped. By contrast, it continued to be a crime in Germany to mention German operations. Following attacks (attributed to Republicans by Germany, but denied) on the German cruiser Leipzig on 15 and 18 June, Germany and Italy once again withdrew from patrols, but not from the Committee. This prompted the Portuguese government to remove British observers on the SpainPortugal border.|$|E

40|$|We {{reflect on}} the {{convergence}} and termination of optimization algorithms based on convex and separable approximations using two recently proposed strategies, namely a trust region with filtered acceptance of the <b>iterates,</b> and conservatism. We then propose a new strategy for convergence and termination, denoted filtered conservatism, in which the acceptance or rejection of an <b>iterate</b> is determined using the nonlinear acceptance filter. However, if an <b>iterate</b> is rejected, we increase the conservatism of every unconservative approximation, rather than reducing the trust region. Filtered conservatism aims to combine the salient features of trust region strategies with nonlinear acceptance filters on the one hand, and conservatism on the other. In filtered conservatism, the nonlinear acceptance filter is used to decide if an <b>iterate</b> is accepted or rejected. This allows for the acceptance of infeasible <b>iterates,</b> which would not be accepted in a method based on conservatism. If however an <b>iterate</b> is rejected, the trust region need not be decreased; it may be kept constant. Convergence is than effected by increasing the conservatism of only the unconservative approximations in the (large, constant) trust region, until the <b>iterate</b> becomes acceptable to the filter. Numerical results corroborate the accuracy and robustness of the method...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Let K be a {{field and}} suppose that f(x) =x n − b is {{irreducible}} in K[x]. We discuss the following question: {{under what conditions}} are all <b>iterates</b> of f irreducible over K? Let K be a field and let f(x) ∈ K[x]. By the <b>iterates</b> of f we mean the sequence of polynomials fr defined by f 0 (x) =x, andfr+ 1 (x) =f(fr(x)) for r ≥ 0. It is clear that if any <b>iterate</b> fm of f is reducible in K[x], then all successive <b>iterates</b> fm+i(x) =fm(fi(x)) are also reducible over K.

Examples exist for every n ≥ 2 andm ≥ 1 ofK and b ∈ K such that fm is irreducible over K but fm+ 1 is reducible. This raises the following question which motivates this paper: under what conditions on K, n, andb are all <b>iterates</b> of f(x) =x n − b irreducible over K?
