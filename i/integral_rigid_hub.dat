40|$|A {{horizontal}} axis wind turbine with a ball-and-socket hub is disclosed. The hub enables {{horizontal axis}} turbines {{with two or}} more blades to teeter in response to wind shear gra-dients. Computer modeling was done using existing and modified FAST code in order to compare the new hub design with existing designs. Results show that a three-bladed tur-bine with the ball-and-socket hub provides very significant reductions in out-of-plane bending loads applied to the main shaft in comparison to a three-bladed turbine with a <b>rigid</b> <b>hub.</b> Results also show that the new hub design provides significant reductions in the out-of-plane loads applied to the blades. A blade fatigue study using a rainflow counting of multi-axial torque contributions at the blade root was performed in order {{to assess the impact of}} these reductions, and results show that the three-bladed turbine equipped with a ball-and-socket, teetering hub provides for very significant reductions in lifetime blade damage in comparison to existing wind turbine designs due to a combination of factors. The first factor is that teetering largely eliminates the cyclic variations in out-of-plane tor-que on the blades that are observed with <b>rigid</b> <b>hubs.</b> Here, the fatigue study shows that the three-bladed wind turbine with a teetering hub provides for an approximate sixfold reduc-tion in lifetime blade damage in comparison to a three-bladed turbine with a <b>rigid</b> <b>hub.</b> The second factor is that the addition of a third blade reduces the load on each blade by one-third.
