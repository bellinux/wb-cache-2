5|$|Both NEC tracks have <b>high-level</b> platforms, {{which were}} added in 2001 {{for use by}} Acela Express trains (which cannot use low platforms). The {{southbound}} NEC track is served by a low platform behind the station, {{which leads to a}} short <b>high-level</b> platform south of State Street. The northbound NEC track is served by a <b>high-level</b> platform behind the station building; the low platform south of State Street is generally only used for deboarding passengers from busy trains. Because of the sharp curve, the <b>high-level</b> platforms are set slightly back from the tracks to avoid scraping the ends of train cars, and thus bridge plates are needed to span the gap between platform and car.|$|E
5|$|Finland, the United States and Sweden are {{the most}} {{advanced}} in developing a deep repository for <b>high-level</b> radioactive waste disposal. Countries vary in their plans on disposing used fuel directly or after reprocessing, with France and Japan having an extensive commitment to reprocessing. The country-specific status of <b>high-level</b> waste management plans are described below.|$|E

5|$|DE 9 {{heads into}} {{marshland}} and crosses the Leipsic River on a <b>high-level</b> bridge, leaving Leipsic. Here, the road becomes Smyrna-Leipsic Road and enters agricultural areas with some woods and homes. Smyrna-Leipsic Road curves {{to the northwest}} and the route continues north on Hay Point Landing Road, running {{to the west of}} the Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge, where the Allee House is located. DE 9 comes to an intersection with DE 6 as it passes through the Woodland Beach Wildlife Area, turning to the northwest as it heads through a mix of woods and marshland. The road continues to a <b>high-level</b> bridge over the Smyrna River.|$|E

5|$|The {{northbound}} platform, {{currently a}} side platform, {{can serve as}} an island platform should passenger service return to the NECR track. The 2010 SCCOG report indicated that Amtrak wished Shore Line East to move its operations to Track 6, freeing the mainline tracks for through trains. In 2013, most Shore Line East trains began using Track 6. Most passengers use the low-level section of the platform south of State Street, but a short metal spur on the <b>high-level</b> platform provides handicapped accessible boarding for trains using the track. A low-level section of the northbound platform also remains north of the <b>high-level</b> section; {{it has not been}} used since the <b>high-level</b> section was constructed.|$|E
5|$|The {{report also}} called for three {{commuter}} rail modernizations. The New Haven Railroad commuter service would get 144 EMUs, as well as signal improvements, <b>high-level</b> platforms, and renovated cars. The Penn Central Railroad would get 130 EMUs, <b>high-level</b> platforms, and electrified trackage north to the Brewster station. The Erie Lackawanna Railroad in New York State would get new equipment, and a study would be conducted {{to determine whether the}} ELRR could go to Pennsylvania Station. All of these improvements were to extend into Phase II of the project.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of anxiety and situation-specific contextual information on attentional, interpretational, and behavioural processes underpinning perceptual-motor performance as proposed by Nieuwenhuys and Oudejans (2012) using an in-situ task. Twelve skilled cricket batsmen played against a skilled spin bowler under conditions manipulated to induce low- and <b>high-levels</b> of anxiety and the presence of low- and <b>high-levels</b> of situation-specific context. High anxiety decreased the number of good bat-ball contacts, while high levels of situation-specific context increased the number of times the ball was missed. When under high anxiety, participants employed significantly more fixations of shorter duration to more locations, but the effects of anxiety were restricted to the attentional level only. Situation-specific context affected performance and behavioural measures but not anxiety, cognitive load or perceptual-cognitive processes, suggesting that performance is influenced through different mechanisms from anxiety that are independent of working memory load...|$|R

25|$|Referring to the {{original}} 50 workers, nuclear researcher Dr. Eric Hall opined that they {{were likely to be}} older, and unlikely to have further children, so the long-term effects of exposure to <b>high-levels</b> of ionizing radiation {{would be less likely to}} appear before a natural death. Some younger workers were injured and young Osaka firefighters were operating at the site.

50|$|It is {{the only}} {{underwater}} vehicle tunnel currently in operation in the state, as the Baytown Tunnel was replaced in 1995 by a bridge. The tunnel consists of a single bore, 895 meters (2,909 feet) in length, with a six-percent roadway grade outward from the center towards each exit. Forced transverse ventilation is potentially provided by three automatic high-speed Westinghouse Sturtevant blower fans located in a tower at the north entrance. These fans are designed to keep the air free from <b>high-levels</b> of carbon monoxide.|$|R
50|$|Privately owned textile mills found {{themselves}} in a very lucrative market. Ever-rising prices due to scarcity and <b>high-levels</b> of demand made sales to the public far more profitable than fixed-price contract sales to the military. So much so, that in the first year private mills often refused or cut back on fulfillments ordered by Confederate quartermasters. The advent of conscription, giving the government de facto control over the labor force, as well as control over railroads and other forms of transport, precluded such avoidance.|$|R
50|$|Elephant {{conservation}} in northern West Bengal {{has been set}} back due to <b>high-levels</b> of human-elephant conflict and elephant mortality owing to railway accidents. The railway track between Siliguri and Alipurduar passes through 74 km of various forest divisions. Every day, 20 trains run on this track at high speeds. Elephants that pass through from one forest patch to another dash against the trains and die.
