40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedPiracy in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Guinea regularly exceeded that <b>of</b> the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Aden between 2000 and 2007. But the major maritime powers established counter-piracy {{operations in the}} <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Aden without replicating {{the same in the}} <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Guinea. Since 2004, theUnited States has closely monitored counter-piracy operations in the Malacca Strait after a failed earlier attempt to materially provide such services. Why are theUnited States and other maritime powers interested in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Aden and Malacca Strait? If the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Guinea states would allow these powers to establish a counter-piracy task force, does the region have the strategic heft to attract these powers? The search for answers to these questions informs this study. The study, which is essentially comparative, synthesizes and analyzes existing quantitative and qualitative data. It reveals that the strategic importance <b>of</b> the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Guinea is minor compared to the Malacca Strait and the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Aden. Therefore, the thesis urges the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Guinea states to search for regional solutions that would materialize improvements in maritime regime governance, security, and development.
