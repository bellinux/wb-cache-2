In the present work, one-dimensional thermal-hydraulic model in U-tubes under heaving movement conditions is established, and the critical pressure drop (CPD) and critical mass flow rate (CMFR) which relate to the occurrence of reverse flow in U-tubes are proposed and analyzed. The effects of the heaving period and <b>heaving</b> <b>acceleration</b> amplitude on the flow instability in U-tubes with the different length are discussed. It is shown that (1) the CPD and CMFR are obviously affected by the heaving movement, which means that the reverse flow characteristic in U-tubes will be changed; (2) the fluctuation periods of the CPD and CMFR are the same as the heaving period, but the fluctuation magnitude of them is little affected by the heaving period; (3) the relative changes of CPD and CMFR are the linear function of <b>heaving</b> <b>acceleration</b> amplitude; and (4) the U-tube length has little influence on the relative changes of CPD and CMFR compared with the <b>heaving</b> <b>acceleration</b> amplitude, which means that the heaving movement has little influence on the space distribution of reverse flow in the U-tubes of marine steam generator...|$|E

The objectives were {{to assess the}} raft motion response, occupant motion, tow force, effect of tow speed, effects of different test variables (drogue deployment, floor inflation, weight distribution and ballast), {{and the likelihood of}} occupant motion sickness. Comparisons of RAOs obtained in regular and irregular waves demonstrated that irregular waves {{could be used as a}} cost effective means to determine raft response with a high degree of confidence. They also show that the life raft tow performance is different in waves than in calm water. For example, mean tow force is 20 % higher in the sea state tested than in calm water. Floor inflation, drogue deployment, even weight distribution and tow speed increase mean tow force and tow force variation about its mean. The data also show that the same ballast types should be used to access the effects of different variables because manikin and water bag ballast produce different results. Measured occupant <b>heave</b> <b>acceleration</b> was about the same as the raft <b>heave</b> <b>acceleration.</b> From occupant <b>heave</b> <b>acceleration,</b> it was estimated that after 20 hours in the raft, 20 % of occupants would vomit.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine whether a floating terminal could be a suitable and feasible solution for the realisation of a new berthing location for the cruise ships of the future. This feasibility study is based on the amount of downtime of a terminal due to excessive motions because of wave loading. Therefore, this study focuses on the hydrodynamic responses of such floating terminals. To be able to carry out this study, local wave data are required, which are not available. Therefore, the local climate is approximated with the wave model SWAN. The hydrodynamic assessment consists of simulations carried out in the frequency domain, using the Ansys AQWA Suite. Considered are vertical and lateral accelerations, roll and pitch motions. Motion criteria for these motions are compared with the simulation results from AQWA. The following aspects have been studied to determine their influence on the amount of downtime: the presence of a cruise vessel, wave angles, swell and wind wave scenarios and two floating terminal variants. From this study, it is concluded that all mentioned aspects do have a notable influence on the amount of downtime of a floating terminal. For both terminal models and all wave angles, <b>heave</b> <b>accelerations</b> are the limiting factor, with and without a cruise vessel next to the terminal. For these two specific floating terminals studied, the realization is only feasible in a specific cases. It is recommended to optimize both the mooring configuration and the dimensions and hull of the floating structure in an additional study. This may lead to reduction of <b>heave</b> <b>accelerations,</b> which in turn can greatly improve the potential of this concept.

40|$|A {{wave energy}} {{converter}} (WEC) of point absorber type is tested at {{the west coast of}} Sweden. The buoy is a vertical cylin-der. The linear generator on the seabed has limited stroke length. Large waves cause the generator to reach its maximum stroke length. As this happen, a spring in the generator is compressed, causing the buoy to instantly come to rest. During this process the force between the buoy and the generator is measured. Also the acceleration of the buoy is measured. This process and the extreme forces on the generator hull is described and the study shows that the magnitude of this force is greatly influenced by the added mass of the buoy and thus the buoy geometry. The ratio between the extreme forces on the hull and the forces during nor-mal operation will affect the dimensioning and economy of the WEC. Force acting between generator and buoy were measured during various events as the WEC was operating.

40|$|In most moving-base flight simulators, the {{simulated}} aircraft motion {{needs to be}} filtered with motion washout filters to keep the simulator within its limited motion envelope. Translational motion in particular requires filtering, as the low-frequency components of the vehicle motion tend to quickly drive simulators toward their motion bounds. Commonly, linear washout filters are therefore used to attenuate {{the simulated}} motion in magnitude and in phase. It is found in many studies that the settings of these washout filters affect pilot performance and control behavior. In most of these studies, no comparison to a case with one-to-one motion cues is performed {{as a result of}} the limited motion envelope of the simulators used. In the current study, an experiment was performed in the SIMONA Research Simulator at the Delft University of Technology to investigate the effects of heave washout settings on pilot performance and control behavior in a pitch attitude control task. In addition to rotational pitch motion, <b>heave</b> <b>accelerations</b> at the pilot station that result directly from aircraft pitch were evaluated. This heave motion component could be supplied one-to-one in the simulator due to the modest size of the aircraft model, a Cessna Citation I business jet. The experiment revealed that pilot performance and control activity both increased significantly with increasing heave motion fidelity. An analysis of pilot control behavior using pilot models indicated that the enhanced performance was caused by an increase in the magnitude with which pilots responded to visual and physical motion stimuli and a decrease in the amount of visual lead that was generated by the pilots...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{a system}} of four sensors for {{measuring}} tri-axis translational accelerations and rotational velocities is designed. The sensors were mounted with a spatial distribution on board the ship model C/S Arctic Drillship. Experiments were carried out and sensor data was collected for waves with various periods and incoming directions. The distributed acceleration measurements were used to estimate translational and rotational accelerations in Center of control. By comparing the estimated accelerations with the high-accuracy measurements from Qualisys, {{it was found that}} the system provides good estimates of the accelerations in Center of control. In addition, the local tri-axis translational accelerations in each sensor frame was estimated, to detect spatial variability of accelerations. This method also performs well, and provides a representation of local forces in the hull. Three methods to estimate the direction of incoming waves are proposed, where one is based on correlation between motion in roll, pitch and yaw, and the two others are based on local accelerations inside the hull. Analysis of motion in roll, pitch and yaw gave some results. Analysis of the horizontal accelerations in the hull was not successful as to detect the surrounding force field, while the <b>heave</b> <b>accelerations</b> gave a better image of the surrounding waves and forces.

Recently, growing attention has been devoted to the advanced design of vessels able to operate effectively even when the system is subject to abrupt movements. The study of the behavior of process fluids (gases and liquids) and their mutual interfaces within the FPSO separators is a very challenging task, which can be tackled effectively by means of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques. In this paper, a fluid dynamic model of a FPSO separator is developed using a CFD methodology. This model is able to predict the behavior of the fluid and of their interfaces within the separators to be installed on FPSOs. Several simulations were carried out to study the behavior of the fluids and the efficiency of two vessel types (reboiler and surge vessel). The vessels are subjected to the forcing conditions typical of an ocean storm, i. e. surge, sway, <b>heave</b> <b>accelerations</b> and roll, pitch and yaw rotations, gathered from real historical data. Transient simulations were carried out applying time-varying accelerations to the vessel. The methodology is described in order to give general guidelines for the FPSO simulations. The main technical contributions of this study are: • the understanding of the behavior of the liquid in the separator mounted on FPSOs in different storm conditions; • the validations of FPSO separator design to assure their functionality even during heavy storms; • the development of a numerical methodology to implement complex CFD simulations in the presence of time-varying boundary conditions which models the effect of sea movements on on-board ship devices...|$|R

These factors are important in the dive patterns and locomotion of alcids that use their wings both for aerial flight and underwater swimming and of penguins that use their wings only for swimming. Using small data-loggers on free-ranging birds diving to 20 – 30 m depth, we measured depth at 1 Hz and surge and <b>heave</b> <b>accelerations</b> at 32 – 64 Hz of four species of alcids (0. 6 – 1. 0 kg mass) and the smallest penguin species (1. 2 kg). Low- and high-frequency components of the fluctuation of acceleration yielded estimates of body angles and stroke frequencies, respectively. Swim speed was estimated from body angle and rate of depth change. Brünnich's (Uria lomvia) and common (Uria aalge) guillemots descended almost vertically, whereas descent of razorbills (Alca torda), rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata) and little penguins (Eudyptula minor) was more oblique. For all species, swim speed during descent was within a relatively narrow range. Above depths of 20 – 30 m, where they were all positively buoyant, all species ascended without wing stroking. During descent, little penguins made forward accelerations on both the upstroke and downstroke regardless of dive depth. By contrast, descending alcids produced forward accelerations on both upstroke and downstroke at depths of < 10 m but mainly on the downstroke at greater depths; this change seemed to correspond to the decrease of buoyancy with increasing depth. The magnitude of surge (forward) acceleration during downstrokes was smaller, and that during upstrokes greater, in little penguins than in alcids. This pattern presumably reflected the proportionally greater mass of upstroke muscles in penguins compared with alcids and may allow little penguins to swim at less variable instantaneous speeds...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{develops a}} theory {{to design a}} controller which estimates and cancels unknown sinusoidal disturbances forcing a linear time-invariant system by using only measurement of state-derivatives of the system. Our design {{is based on the}} following steps; parametrization of the sinusoidal disturbance as the output of a known feedback system with an unknown output vector that depends on both unknown disturbance parameters and unknown plant parameters, design of an adaptive disturbance observer, and finally design of an adaptive controller. We extend the results for unmatched disturbances by using a backstepping procedure. We employ the developed controller {{to solve the problem of}} cargo transfer in high sea states over a ramp from a large, medium-speed, roll-on/roll-off (LMSR) vessel to a smaller connector vessel of a surface effect ship (SES) type. Our aim is to reduce ramp motion between the LMSR and SES in order to provide a safer environment for cargo transfer. We design an air cushion actuated controller to estimate and cancel the wave disturbance and stabilize the heave of the SES via <b>heave</b> <b>acceleration</b> feedback with actuation of the louver area for the case where the hydrodynamic and other parameters of the SES are not known a priori and the pressure dynamics of the air-cushion contains nonlinearly parameterized unknown terms. We also consider a two- chamber air-cushion SES model and design an adaptive controller to regulate heave and pitch simultaneously. In addition a tracking algorithm is proposed to keep the ramp stationary during the cargo transfer. We demonstrate the effects of our control designs in simulations in a time- domain seakeeping code, named AEGIR. We also implement the developed controller on a scale model SES. We perform several experiments in a wave tank to test the performance of the controller. It is shown that the experimental results we have obtained are consistent with the developed theor...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSouthern {{elephant}} seals (Mirounga leonina) range widely {{throughout the}} Southern Ocean and {{are associated with}} important habitats (e. g., ice edges, shelf) where they accumulate energy to fuel their reproductive efforts on land. Knowledge of the fine scale foraging behaviour used to garner this energy, however, is limited. For the first time, acceleration loggers were deployed on three adult southern elephant seals during a translocation study at Kerguelen Island. The aims {{of the study were}} to (1) identify prey capture attempts using 2 -D accelerometer tags deployed on the head of southern elephant seals, (2) compare the number of foraging dives identified by simple dive depth profiles and accelerometer profiles and (3) compare dive characteristics between prey encounter and non-prey encounter dives. The 2 -D loggers recorded depth every second, surge and <b>heave</b> <b>accelerations</b> at 8 or 16 Hz and were carried for periods between 23 and 121 h. Rapid head movements were interpreted to be associated with prey encounter events. Acceleration data detected possible prey encounter events in 39 - 52 % of dives whilst 67 - 80 % of dives were classified as foraging dives when using dive depth profiles alone. Prey encounters occurred in successive dives during days and nights and lasted between tenths of a second and 7. 6 min. Binomial linear mixed effect models showed that seals were diving significantly deeper and increased both descent rate and bottom duration when encountering prey. Dive duration, however, did not significantly increase during dives with prey encounters. These results are in accordance with optimal foraging theory, which predicts that deep divers should increase both their transit rates and the time spent at depth when a profitable prey patch is encountered. These findings indicate that this technique is promising as it more accurately detects possible prey encounter events compared with dive depth profiles alone and thus provides a better understanding of seal foraging strategies...|$|R

The study of their movements and behavioural ecology is however problematic and {{has led to a}} gap in our knowledge {{when it comes to the}} spatial movements within migrations. Advances in technology in the form of tagging development and procedure have transformed this area of science to a growth in archival tags, overcoming many of these previous problems with free-ranging marine animals. This study focuses on the fine-scale movements of Sepia officinalis, using the G 6 A Data Storage Tag (DST). This modern tag allows for the tri-axial movements, termed surge, sway and <b>heave</b> <b>acceleration</b> (g), of cuttlefish to be studied, as well as the environmental factors pressure (m) and temperature (oC). Six cuttlefish (145 - 290 mm) were captured and successfully fitted with the DST and recorded on all 5 sensors for a period of 7 days. Feeding trials were undertaken to determine movement patterns within prey-capture and manipulation. The dynamic acceleration data was analysed through comparisons of the raw tag data with video recordings and further observations. Results indicate that cuttlefish have very similar peak activity within diel periods (p = 0. 164), with both diurnal activity and crepuscular activity (p < 0. 000) present. This activity was observed more closely within feeding events, showing strong accuracy in attacks (100 %) within 4 of the cuttlefish and 51. 7 % in the other cuttlefish. The tri-axial accelerations suggested significant differences between all feeding event movements (p < 0. 000). Conversely surge acceleration alone was observed to display a displacement pattern within prey-capture. However, further analysis identified both significant differences (p < 0. 000) and possible similarities (p = 0. 129) when compared to jetting, another active behaviour. These findings suggest a behavioural signature, possibly individual (stereotypic) within a cuttlefish’s prey-capture movements.

40|$|In {{the study}} of the sea keeping qualities of a ship, it is {{considered}} indispensable to measure the encountered wave heights and to know the relation between the ship's motions and the ocean wave form, simultanously, during the ship's cruising course. From this point of view, the authors devised a step-type wave measuring apparatus which could be fixed on a side of the midship of a fishing boat for the measurement of the relative encountered wave heights vertical to the sea surface at a given point on the ship's body. Then, there is the problem to obtain the exact measurement of the encountered wave heights in the way described above, for the relative wave heights include the components of the ship's motions. In this study, as the relative wave heights were measured, the encountered wave heights were obtained by subtracting the ship's motions from the relative wave heights algebraically. On the other hand, as the pitching angles and <b>heaving</b> <b>accelerations</b> were measured during the ship's motions, it was necessary to convert accelerations into displacements by way of double integration {{on the basis of the}} recorded motions. There were some difficulties in the method of double integration of the recorded wave data, but the authors obtained a practically effective method. The following results were obtained from this study. 1) The double integration of the observed vertical accelerations which were recorded as analogous values was carried by the approximate integral method by the use of an active band pass filter with the frequency range from 0. 03 Hz to 0. 07 Hz. The amplitude gain was ± 0. 5 dB and the phase shift was less than 15 deg. 2) The error of measurement of the wave heights by this method could be estimated to be within 10 % in the range of frequency for the heaving motions of the fishing boat by the experimental way. 耐航性に関する実船試験の場合,時間の関数として波高を連続測定する事が前提条件であり,出合い波高測定を必要とする。このために船体装着型のステップ式波高計を製作し,相対波高をまず測定した。得られた出合いの相対波高より,これに含まれている船体運動の影響を除き,出合波高を得る方法を試みた。船体運動の要素中でヒービングは加速度で得られているため,これを変位に変換する 2 回積分法が最も困難であるが本手法による結果は次の通りである。 1) 2 回積分法にはアナログ演算法を用いたが,積分回路の利得特性は 0. 03 Hz以上の周波数範囲で誤差は± 0. 5 dB以内であり,位相誤差は- 15 度以内であった。 2) 相対波高測定から出合い波高算出までの総合精度は,船体の上下動加速度信号の 2 回積分の精度如何である。周波数領域での検討の結果,ヒービングの主要周波数範囲内で、利得特性で最大誤差 10 %以内,位相誤差は- 10 度以内であった。 3) 実船試験のための出合い波高計測法としての本手法は,現場測定等の諸条件から考察し,実用的に有効であり十分な精度であると考えられる...|$|R

Global impact forces were derived from an inertial measurement system called MOTAN. In general, global forces of up to 9. 0 MN were measured for maximum impact speed from 3. 1 to 10. 2 kt. Most of the impacts were conducted with two floes of known thickness and strength. Only two floes were sampled during the two-week program, but they characterized {{a wide spectrum of}} multi-year ice. Floe B 1 S 1 was the thinner of the two floes (7. 2 m), quite warm, saline and relatively weak (the depth-averaged borehole strength of the two test holes was 7. 3 MPa and 4. 5 MPa). Floe B 1 S 2 was thicker (8. 0 m), colder, less saline and stronger (the depth-averaged borehole strength of the uppermost 7 m of ice was 22. 0 MPa). As anticipated, global impact forces and ship accelerations were higher during collisions with the thicker, stronger floe than the weaker floe, for comparable ship speeds. The highest surge acceleration (1. 03 m/s 2) occurred during the final ram with Floe B 1 S 2 which was conducted at a maximum impact speed of 6. 7 kt. That collision generated the highest global impact force of the program: 9. 0 MN. The highest <b>heave</b> <b>acceleration</b> (0. 84 m/s 2) and sway acceleration (0. 46 m/s 2) occurred during rams with Floe B 1 S 1, while transiting to a natural harbour within the floe. Global forces from 18 impacts with isolated multi-year floes floating in open pack ice were comparable to many of the rams with Floe B 1 S 1, for a given impact speed. Comparison of the Commanding Officer 2 ̆ 019 s expected ice severity for the 18 impacts indicated that even experienced personnel can have difficulty ascertaining the competency of multi-year ice. Impact forces and accelerations measured by MOTAN on the CCGS Amundsen were comparable to MOTAN-derived measurements on the CCGS Terry Fox from oblique impacts with bergy bits. The maximum heave, surge and sway accelerations on the CCGS Terry Fox were respectively 0. 57 m/s 2, 0. 56 m/s 2 and 1. 24 m/s 2 during the Bergy Bit Trials, with measured global impact forces of up to 10. 6 MN. Global impact forces and accelerations on the CCGS Amundsen during this study were not nearly as high as the impact forces measured by other instrumentation systems on ships operating more aggressively in Beaufort Sea multi-year ice.

40|$|In {{flapping}} underwater vehicles the propulsive {{performance of}} harmonically sinusoidal heaving and pitching foil will be degraded by some awkward changes in effective {{angle of attack}} profile, as the Strouhal number increases. This paper surveys different angle of attack profiles (Sinusoidal, Square, Sawtooth and Cosine) and considers their thrust production ability. In {{the wide range of}} Strouhal numbers, thrust production of Square profile is considerable but it has a discontinuity in heave velocity profile, in which an infinite acceleration exists. This problem poses a significant defect in control of flapping foil. A novel profile function is proposed to omit sharp changes in <b>heave</b> velocity and <b>acceleration.</b> Furthermore, an optimum profile is found for different Strouhal numbers with respect to Square angle of attack profile...|$|R

Diving animals modulate their swimming gaits to promote locomotor efficiency and so enable longer, more productive dives. Beaked whales perform extremely long and deep foraging dives that probably exceed aerobic capacities for some species. Here, we use biomechanical data from suction-cup tags attached to three species of beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris, N = 10; Ziphius cavirostris, N = 9; and Hyperoodon ampullatus, N = 2) to characterize their swimming gaits. In addition to continuous stroking and stroke and-glide gaits described for other diving mammals, all whales produced occasional fluke-strokes with distinctly larger dorsoventral acceleration, which we termed 'type-B' strokes. These high-power strokes occurred almost exclusively during deep dive ascents as part of a novel mixed gait. To quantify body rotations and specific acceleration generated during strokes we adapted a kinematic method combining data from two sensors in the tag. Body rotations estimated with high-rate magnetometer data were subtracted from accelerometer data to estimate the resulting surge and <b>heave</b> <b>accelerations.</b> Using this method, we show that stroke duration, rotation angle and acceleration were bi-modal for these species, with B-strokes having 76 % of the duration, 52 % larger body rotation and four times more surge than normal strokes. The additional acceleration of B-strokes did not lead to faster ascents, but rather enabled brief glides, which may improve the overall efficiency of this gait. Their occurrence towards the end of long dives leads us to propose that B-strokes may recruit fast-twitch fibres that comprise similar to 80 % of swimming muscles in Blainville's beaked whales, thus prolonging foraging time at depth.

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{series of}} double-chine, wide-transom hull forms with warped planing surface {{has been developed}} at the Laboratory for Ship & Marine Hydrodynamics (LSMH) of the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) during the last 15 years. The series, inspired by a proposal of Savitsky et al (1972), provides a handy and suitable base {{for the design of}} medium and large modern monohull ships and pleasure craft, which operate at high but pre-planing speeds. The series consists of five hull forms with L/B ratios equal to 4. 00, 4. 75, 5. 50, 6. 25 & 7. 00. Two scaled models for each hull form have been constructed and tested at six displacements, including very light ones. The resistance characteristics of the series were presented by Grigoropoulos and Loukakis (2002). On the way to investigate systematically the dynamic performance of the series in waves, model tests have been carried out in regular waves and the results are presented in this paper. The tests encompass three level-keel displacements and two speeds corresponding to Fn = 0. 34 and 0. 68. The RAO curves for <b>heave,</b> pitch, <b>acceleration</b> at two points along the hull as well as added resistance are presented.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this thesis are {{to describe the}} Subsea Well Intervention System (SWIS) andto test the hypothesis that this system has significant potential economic benefits over asemi-submersible rig-based system which is normally used for completing common subseawell intervention procedures. These interventions are carried out in water depths from 200 mto 3, 000 m. This thesis describes SWIS and its applications to subsea well interventions, discusses themain technical issues involved and provides an economic analysis of the cost benefit incomparison to semi-submersible and Drill Ship rig-based systems. Examples of subsea wellinterventions discussed in this thesis include: de-sanding, de-scaling, re-entry drilling andwellhead recovery. A discussion {{and analysis of the}} vessel response to the likely operatingsea states and an analysis of heave compensation for the Coiled Tubing (CT) system isincluded as these are critical factors to the technical viability of SWIS. SWIS is designed to have a light to medium level well intervention capability and it willprovide a tool for common subsea well intervention procedures. It is not designed for tubingchange out which is classified as a heavy level workover. In this case a conventional rig or aHydraulic Workover rig supported by a semi-submersible would be used. SWIS will be designed to include the following capabilities: Well and field abandonment;Artificial Lift Services; Re-entry Drilling using CT including well side tracking anddeepening operations (Operations to include CT under-balanced drilling and ThroughTubing); Deployment and recovery of Sand Control Screens using CT as a conveying tool;Through Tubing Completions using CT as a conveying tool; Post-completion well clean-upoperations; Slick-line and electric line operations and sub-sea wellhead maintenance andrecovery. The SWIS concept vessel is a large scale wave piercing catamaran which will be maintainedon station and heading into the prevailing sea using a Dynamic Positioning System (DPS). Initial modelling of the response of the vessel to typical expected operating sea stateconditions is encouraging because the results indicate that this type of vessel will provide astable platform from which to carry out typical subsea well intervention procedures. The modelling has demonstrated that the vessel motions (other than heave) are minimalunder the expected operating conditions and will be compensated by the Spooled CompositeRiser (SCR) and the CT. The heave amplitude and <b>heave</b> <b>acceleration</b> of the centre of gravity of the vessel will besuch that an off the shelf heave compensation system is available for the Spooled CompositeRiser (SCR). Research has indicated that existing CT heave compensation systems can bereadily modified for use with SWIS to provide the required level of motion compensation tocarry out intervention procedures in moderately rough seas. The hypothesis that a catamaran based platform used for the above purpose has significantpotential economic benefits over a semi-submersible for common types of interventionprocedures is supported by the research completed. It is concluded that the savings resultingfrom the use of the SWIS vessel compared to a semi-submersible would be around USD 360, 000 per day. It is also concluded from the research and modelling completed that SWIS is a technicallyand economically viable system. Based on the survey carried out it has the potential for ahigh degree of utilization in the East Asian and Australian offshore regions due of the abovecost saving. It also has the potential for a high degree of utilisation in other offshore regions such as Brazil and West Africa where sea states are light to moderate...|$|R

40|$|Compared with {{standard}} vessels, a slender catamaran with a semi-submerged bow (SSB) demonstrates superior seakeeping performance. To predict {{the motion of}} an SSB catamaran, computational fluid dynamics methods are adopted {{in this study and}} results are validated through small-scale model tests. The pitch, <b>heave,</b> and vertical <b>acceleration</b> are calculated at various wavelengths and speeds. Based on the overset grid and motion region methods, this study obtains the motion responses of an SSB catamaran in regular head waves. The results of the numerical studies are validated with the experimental data and show that the overset grid method is more accurate in predicting the motion of an SSB catamaran; the errors can be controlled within 20 %. The movement data in regular waves shows that at a constant speed, the motion response initially increases and then decreases with increasing wavelength. This motion response peak is due to the encountering frequency being close to the natural frequency. Under identical sea conditions, the motion response increases with the increasing Froude number. The motion prediction results, that derive from a short-term irregular sea state, show that there is an optimal speed range that can effectively reduce the amplitude of motion...|$|R

40|$|Planing hull {{forms are}} {{commonly}} used for fast patrol boats, pleasure craft, SAR vessels. Beside powering prediction, the seakeeping assessment and optimization are considered mostly important for their design. The aim of this Thesis {{was to develop a}} numerical method, accurate, robust and fast, to be used in design of fast small craft without excessive computational time necessity, for the calculation in time domain of planing boats vertical motions. The difficulties related to the description of planing hulls seakeeping physics through a set of mathematical equations {{led to the development of}} the two mathematical models. The complete theoretical models "non- linear time domain simulation" and "fully non- linear time domain simulation" were subsequently implemented in a numerical codes in Matlab-Simulink environment. Experimental program on warped planing hulls seakeeping, has been performed in Towing tank of Department of Industrial Engineering of University of Naples Federico II with aim to validate developed methodology. The availability of specific and dedicated experimental tests allowed to compare time series of experimental and numerical data results, not only typical values reported in literature, and furthermore to analyze them in the same manner. This synergy of numerical and experimental approaches resulted in accurate validation of developed methodology. Numerical and experimental <b>heave,</b> pitch and <b>accelerations</b> at CG and at bow for three model speeds for monohedral and for the most innovative warped hull form with variable angle of the bottom, representative of current trends, are analyzed in time domain and in frequency domain. From the spectral analysis was possible to determine the magnitude of the higher order harmonics, which are negligible for motions and significant for accelerations. Small non-linearity in the motions, results in a significant contribution of the higher order harmonics in accelerations. Nonlinearities in accelerations responses have been obtained by developed codes with high accuracy in whole speed and wave frequencies range. The developed fully non-linear mathematical model is accurate and reliable to be used in design of fast small craft seakeeping assessment. Future developments are concerning pressure distribution along the hull and responses calculations in irregular sea...|$|R
