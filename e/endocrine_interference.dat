50|$|The {{detrimental}} {{health effects}} of PCB exposure to humans became undeniable when two separate incidents of contaminated cooking oil poisoned thousands of residents in Japan (Yushō disease, 1968) and Taiwan (Yu-cheng disease, 1979), leading to a worldwide ban on PCB use in 1977. Recent studies show the <b>endocrine</b> <b>interference</b> of certain PCB congeners is toxic to the liver and thyroid, increases childhood obesity in children exposed prenatally, and may {{increase the risk of}} developing diabetes.|$|E
40|$|Lindane (gamma-HCH) is a {{persistent}} environmental pollutant that may act as endocrine disrupter, affecting the nervous, immune and reproductive system, possibly through endocrine-mediated mechanisms. Since both estrogen receptors (ER-alpha and -beta) have {{shown to be}} target for endocrine disruption, we investigated the role of gamma-HCH {{on the development of}} female reproductive system. For an in vivo evaluation of gamma-HCH effects during prenatal period, pregnant CD 1 mice were treated p. o. on gestational days 9 - 16 with 15 mg/kg bw/day of gamma-HCH and vehicle. The in vivo findings in treated F 1 pups - in the absence of signs of systemic toxicity - included increase in the absolute and relative and absolute uterus weight revealed on post-natal day 22, earlier vaginal patency and reduced diameters of primary oocytes at fully sexual maturity. No effects on steroid hormone metabolism (aromatase, testosterone catabolism) were observed. Thus, gamma-HCH elicited subtle effects on female reproductive development likely mediated by ER-beta-mediated pathway(s), without a concurrent impairment of steroid hormone metabolism. Furthermore, to verify whether the <b>endocrine</b> <b>interference</b> of gamma-HCH is attributable to stimulation of ER-beta-mediated pathway(s), its effect has been evaluated in vitro on a cell line, LNCaP, expressing only functional ER-beta. In vitro treatments revealed a concentration-related effect on LNCaP cell viability and proliferation. Significantly, the contemporary addition of a pure anti-estrogen, the ER antagonist ICI 182, 780, completely reversed gamma-HCH effects indicating an ER-beta-mediated action. Our findings indicate that gamma-HCH may act as endocrine disruptor during the female reproductive system development and ER-beta as a potential target for this compound and other endocrine disrupting chemicals as well...|$|E
40|$|Jérôme N. Feige, Laurent Gelman (Both authors contributed {{equally to}} the {{reported}} work) International audienceThe ability of pollutants to affect human health {{is a major}} concern, justified by the wide demonstration that reproductive functions are altered by endocrine disrupting chemicals. The definition of endocrine disruption is today extended to broader endocrine regulations, and includes activation of metabolic sensors, such as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Toxicology approaches have demonstrated that phthalate plasticizers can directly influence PPAR activity. What is now missing is a detailed molecular understanding of the fundamental basis of <b>endocrine</b> disrupting chemical <b>interference</b> with PPAR signaling. We thus performed structural and functional analyses that demonstrate how monoethyl-hexyl-phthalate (MEHP) directly activates PPARgamma and promotes adipogenesis, albeit to a lower extent than the full agonist rosiglitazone. Importantly, we demonstrate that MEHP induces a selective activation of different PPARgamma target genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and fluorescence microscopy in living cells reveal that this selective activity correlates with the recruitment of a specific subset of PPARgamma coregulators that includes Med 1 and PGC- 1 alpha, but not p 300 and SRC- 1. These results highlight some key mechanisms in metabolic disruption but are also instrumental {{in the context of}} selective PPAR modulation, a promising field for new therapeutic development based on PPAR modulation...|$|R

40|$|Emerging organic {{contaminants}} (EOCs) such as pharmaceuticals {{and personal}} care products (PPCPs) are present in areas of significant urbanization and affect treated and untreated wastewater, groundwater, drinking water as well as associated environmental matrices like sludges and sediments. The occurrence of these compounds at very low but environmentally relevant concentrations has earned them the collective term “micropollutants” while an important subgroup is causing concern because of their impact on organisms including humans via biological effects such as hormonal <b>interference</b> (<b>endocrine</b> disrupting compounds, EDCs) or bioaccumulation. Physicochemical techniques are not particularly effective {{for the removal of}} micropollutants. Conventional activated sludge systems are also relatively ineffective, but better PPCP removal has been observed by several teams to correlate with longer sludge retention time and/or more efficient nitrification. In the latter process a number of micropollutants including EDCs are (co) metabolized pointing to the active role of ammonia monooxygenase. This and other oxidative enzymes like cytochrome P- 450 are involved in the transformation and removal of the biological effects of EDCs. Similarly, broad spectrum oxidative enzymes like fungal laccases and peroxidases are promising biocatalysts against PPCPs. The re-usability of such enzymes and their separability from reactants and products can be ensured by carrier-based immobilization or by formation of cross-linked enzyme aggregate (CLEAs). In our group, laccase-CLEAs have been successfully produced and applied for the treatment of micropollutants in adapted reactor systems. Furthermore, we have identified key factors for the production of CLEAs of laccases alone or of combined oxidoreductases (e. g. versatile peroxidase coupled to glucose oxidase), and we have improved these novel biocatalysts by applying rational experimental design and optimization methodologies, as shown in the degradation and detoxification of bisphenol A, a ubiquitous EDC. An illustration of the powerful possibilities afforded by multi-enzyme biocatalysts involves our co-aggregation of laccases from Coriolopsis polyzona, with an acidic pH-optimum, and from Coprinopsis cinerea, with a neutral pH-optimum, in a single biocatalyst. The combi-CLEAs obtained showed activity over a broad pH-range implying their suitability for the treatment of micropollutant-contaminated real wastewaters of varying pHs. Finally we have prepared novel robust biocatalysts for EDC removal based on laccase encapsulated by biomimetic titanification. The creative fusion of biocatalysis, chemical engineering fundamentals and nanotechnology opens up particularly attractive horizons towards sustainable treatment of micropollutant contaminated water resources...|$|R
