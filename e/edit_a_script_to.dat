40|$|We have {{designed}} a graphical interface that enables 3 D visual artists or developers of interactive 3 D virtual environments to efficiently define sophisticated camera compositions by creating storyboard flames, indicating how a desired shot should appear. These storyboard frames are then automatically encoded into an extensive set of virtual camera constraints hat capture the key visual composition {{elements of the}} storyboard frame. Visual composition elements include the size and position of a subject in a camera shot. A recursive heuristic constraint solver then searches {{the space of a}} given 3 D virtual environment to determine camera parameter values which produce a shot closely matching the one in the given storyboard frame. The search method uses given ranges of allowable parameter values expressed by each constraint {{to reduce the size of}} the 7 Degree of Freedom search space of possible camera positions, aim direction vectors, and field of view angles. In contrast, some existing methods of automatically positioning cameras in 3 D virtual environments rely on pre-defined camera placements that cannot account for unanticipated configurations and movement of objects or use program-like <b>scripts</b> <b>to</b> define constraint-based camera shots. For example, it is more intuitive to directly manipulate an object's ize in the frame rather than <b>editing</b> <b>a</b> constraint <b>script</b> <b>to</b> specify that the object should cover 10 % of the frame's area...|$|R

50|$|Micromontage {{is the use}} of montage on {{the time}} scale of microsounds. Its primary proponent is {{composer}} Horacio Vaggione in works such as Octuor (1982), Thema (1985, Wergo 2026-2), and Schall (1995, Mnémosyne Musique Média LDC 278-1102). The technique may include the extraction and arrangement of sound particles from a sample or the creation and exact placement of each particle to create complex sound patterns or singular particles (transients). It may be accomplished through graphic <b>editing,</b> <b>a</b> <b>script,</b> or automated through a computer program.|$|R
