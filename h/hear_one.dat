500|$|In 1955, {{aided by}} junior counsel Sebag Shaw and Peter Rawlinson, Stevenson defended Ruth Ellis against {{the charge of}} murdering her lover. Stevenson's {{decision}} to keep his cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses to a minimum, and his [...] "near silent performance in court", have been severely criticised by Muriel Jakubait, Ellis's sister. He opened the defence by saying: [...] "Let me make this abundantly plain: {{there is no question}} here but this woman shot this man... You will not <b>hear</b> <b>one</b> word from me– or from the lady herself– questioning that." [...] The jury took 23minutes to find Ellis guilty; she was sentenced to be hanged, the last woman executed for murder in the United Kingdom. Public revulsion at the case is thought to have played a part in the abolition of capital punishment in the UK in 1969.|$|E
500|$|Further {{allegations}} of homophobic content arose when a easter egg {{was discovered in}} the game's opening tutorial level.

This easter egg references the United States policy [...] "Don't ask, don't tell", which prevented openly gay people from serving in the United States Armed Forces. Unlike the [...] "Fight Against Grenade Spam" [...] video, few journalists commented on the easter egg. Jim Sterling of Destructoid felt that the easter egg was [...] "too silly/stupid" [...] for him to be angry at, while James Sherwood of The Register commented that people were trying to generate controversy over unimportant dialogue. Lyle Masaki of Logo TV's NewNowNext.com deemed the easter egg to be homophobic, but not representative of the game as a whole.|$|E

500|$|A few {{innovative}} commercial directors immediately saw {{the ways}} in which sound could be employed {{as an integral part of}} cinematic storytelling, beyond the obvious function of recording speech. In Blackmail, Hitchcock manipulated the reproduction of a character's monologue so the word [...] "knife" [...] would leap out from a blurry stream of sound, reflecting the subjective impression of the protagonist, who is desperate to conceal her involvement in a fatal stabbing. In his first film, the Paramount Applause (1929), Rouben Mamoulian created the illusion of acoustic depth by varying the volume of ambient sound in proportion to the distance of shots. At a certain point, Mamoulian wanted the audience to <b>hear</b> <b>one</b> character singing at the same time as another prays; according to the director, [...] "They said we couldn't record the two things—the song and the prayer—on one mike and one channel. So I said to the sound man, 'Why not use two mikes and two channels and combine the two tracks in printing?'" [...] Such methods would eventually become standard procedure in popular filmmaking.|$|E
500|$|The vocals, handled {{jointly by}} Shields and Butcher, are kept {{relatively}} {{low in the}} mix, and {{are for the most}} part highly pitched. On occasion Shields sang the higher register and Butcher the lower one. According to Shields, because the band had spent so long working on the album's vocals, he [...] "couldn't tolerate really clear vocals, where you just <b>hear</b> <b>one</b> voice", thus [...] "it had to be more like a sound." [...] Butcher explained her [...] "dreamy, sensual" [...] style vocals, saying, [...] "Often when we do vocals, it's 7:30 in the morning; I've usually just fallen asleep and have to be woken up to sing." [...] To aid this effect, Shields and Ó Cíosóig even sampled Butcher's voice and reused it as instrumentation. The layered vocals on [...] "When You Sleep" [...] were born out of frustration with trying to get the right take. Shields commented that [...] "The vocals sound like that because it became boring and too destructive trying to get the right vocal. So I decided to put all the vocals in. (It had been sung 12 or 13 times)." [...] He explained: ...|$|E
500|$|In {{comparison}} to previous albums, Graduation features fewer guest appearances from other recording artists. West elaborated {{that it was}} a fully conscious decision to keep his guest vocalists at a minimum, saying that, [...] "When I hear the records of my favorite bands – The Killers or Coldplay – you only <b>hear</b> <b>one</b> voice from start to finish." [...] R singers T-Pain and Dwele, New York rappers Mos Def and ALBe. Back, and famed hip-hop record producer DJ Premier are featured in individual tracks primarily to deliver hooks and refrains. However, though he originally intended for Graduation to be completely devoid of guest rap verses, West decided to invite New Orleans rapper Lil Wayne on the track [...] "Barry Bonds". At the time, the two MCs had been working together, with West contributing to the production of Lil Wayne's sixth studio album Tha Carter III. As for the absence of skits, West explained, [...] "There's just serious songs, hooks, chords, and ideas. No special effects or antics ... and no fake Bernie Mac!" [...] West instead decided to record two earthy musical interludes in place of the hip-hop skits. He incorporated African sounds and polyrhythmic percussion into both. However, for unknown reasons, the two musical interludes were omitted from the studio album.|$|E

500|$|Many of {{the nobility}} and gentry were leaving {{town for the}} summer, but Leopold {{reckoned}} that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th. This was deemed a success, and Leopold hastened to arrange for Wolfgang to appear at a benefit concert for a maternity hospital on 29 June, at Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens. Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as [...] "a way to earn the love of this very special nation". Wolfgang was advertised as [...] "the celebrated and astonishing Master Mozart, a Child of Seven Years of Age..." [...] (he was in fact eight), [...] "justly esteemed the most extraordinary Prodigy, and most amazing Genius, that has appeared in any Age". On 8 July there was a private performance at the Grosvenor Square home of the Earl of Thanet, from which Leopold returned with an inflammation of the throat and other worrying symptoms. [...] "Prepare your heart to <b>hear</b> <b>one</b> of the saddest events", he wrote to Hagenauer in anticipation of his own imminent demise. He was ill for several weeks, {{and for the sake}} of his health the family moved from their Cecil Court lodgings to a house in the countryside, at 180 Ebury Street, then considered part of the village of Chelsea.|$|E
500|$|The Moon Shaped Pool tour drew {{criticism}} for its {{inclusion of a}} date in Tel Aviv on 19 July, disregarding the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign for an international cultural boycott of Israel. Radiohead were subject to protests at some concerts, where sections of the audience unfurled Palestinian flags. On 23 April, more than 50 prominent figures, including musician Roger Waters, whose 2017 album Is This the Life We Really Want? was produced by Godrich, signed a petition urging Radiohead to cancel the show. Yorke told Rolling Stone he found the criticism [...] "extremely upsetting ... choose to, rather than engage with us personally, throw shit at us in public. It's deeply disrespectful to assume that we're either being misinformed or that we're so retarded we can't make these decisions ourselves. I thought it was patronising in the extreme." [...] He felt the criticisms created [...] "divisive energy" [...] rather than [...] "bring people together". Godrich added {{that he did not}} [...] "believe in cultural boycotts ... I don't think they're positive, ever ... The people you'd be denying [...] are the people who would agree with you and don't necessarily agree with their government." [...] Waters responded in a public statement saying he had written to Yorke months earlier, but that Yorke had replied angrily and not replied to further correspondence. On 11 July, filmmaker Ken Loach wrote in the Independent that [...] " [...] stubborn refusal to engage with the many critics of their ill-advised concert in Tel Aviv suggests to me that they only want to <b>hear</b> <b>one</b> side – the one that supports apartheid... Radiohead need to decide if they stand with the oppressed or with the oppressor." [...] Yorke responded in a statement: [...] "Playing in a country isn't the same as endorsing the government. Music, art and academia is about crossing borders not building them, about open minds not closed ones, about shared humanity, dialogue and freedom of expression." [...] The show went ahead as planned, with Yorke telling the audience: [...] "A lot was said about this, but in the end we played some music." ...|$|E

2500|$|Contemporary {{reviews of}} the album were highly favorable, {{recognizing}} it as an important album in Zappa's discography. The New Rolling Stone Album Guide described the album as an [...] "inspired monstrosity... assault of glorious noise". AllMusic writer Steve Huey wrote, [...] "despite {{the absence of a}} conceptual framework, the unfocused sprawl of Uncle Meat is actually a big part of its appeal.

But it's very hard to say you have reasonable doubt on all five, especially when four of the five aren't alleged by eyewitnesses but are proven by DNA matches."
