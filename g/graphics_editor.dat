She visited Chittenden in October 1874, there meeting the reporter Henry Steel Olcott, who was investigating the Eddy's claims for the Daily Graphic. Claiming that Blavatsky impressed him with her own ability to manifest spirit phenomena, Olcott authored a newspaper article on her. They soon became close friends, giving each other the nicknames of [...] "Maloney" [...] (Olcott) and [...] "Jack" [...] (Blavatsky). He helped attract greater attention to Blavatsky's claims, encouraging the Daily <b>Graphics</b> <b>editor</b> to publish an interview with her, and discussing her in his book on Spiritualism, People from the Other World (1875), which her Russian correspondent Alexandr Aksakov urged her to translate into Russian.|$|E

50|$|Image editing {{encompasses}} {{the processes of}} altering images, whether they are digital photographs, traditional photochemical photographs, or illustrations. Traditional analog image editing is known as photo retouching, using tools such as an airbrush to modify photographs, or editing illustrations with any traditional art medium. Graphic software programs, which can be broadly grouped into vector <b>graphics</b> <b>editors,</b> raster <b>graphics</b> <b>editors,</b> and 3D modelers, are the primary tools with which a user may manipulate, enhance, and transform images. Many image editing programs are also used to render or create computer art from scratch.|$|R
