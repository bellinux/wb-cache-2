5|$|The tragedy {{became part}} of the Albanian folk song {{repertoire}} relating to the migration of Albanians abroad. The leading figures of this practice were local intellectuals called rapsods related the mythistory of kurbet before World War II with the migration. They make use of metaphors and performance devices taken from oral folk poetry and death laments which react on the migrations to <b>fix</b> <b>them</b> in the memory of the community. This became a tool for responding to the loss of life for the tragedy of Otranto and other tragic events.|$|E
5|$|The {{date was}} changed {{once more to}} August 3, before it was finally {{released}} in stores on August 24, 1995, {{the same day as}} the Microsoft's operating system Windows 95 version. Phantasmagoria came out first for Windows 95, Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS, then for Macintosh computers in November 1995. A hint book by Sierra came out {{at the same time as}} the game. Phantasmagoria was also ported to Sega Saturn and spanned eight discs exclusively in Japan, where it was fully translated and dubbed into Japanese, and released by Outrigger under the name Phantasm. In response to all the delays, Vince Broady, executive editor of the monthly publication Multimedia World, said Sierra may have been attempting to avoid the same mistakes from the previous year with Outpost, for which the company released many advertisements and reviews, but then over-promoted and released before it was finished. Sierra spokeswoman Kathy Gillmore admitted that mistakes were made in marketing Outpost and Sierra had tried to <b>fix</b> <b>them.</b> The minimum system requirements were an IBM compatible 486–25, 8 megabytes of RAM, 5 megabytes hard disk space, SVGA (256 colors) and a 2x CD-ROM. It supported Sound Blaster-compatible sound cards, and for MS-DOS the game worked with a megahertz chip. It sold for as much as $80 in some stores, but was typically sold for $69.95.|$|E

25|$|In 1986, Hyman and Honorton {{published}} A Joint Communiqué which {{agreed on}} the methodological problems and on ways to <b>fix</b> <b>them.</b> They suggested a computer-automated control, where randomization and the other methodological problems identified were eliminated. Hyman and Honorton agreed that replication of the studies was necessary before final conclusions could be drawn. They also agreed that more stringent standards were necessary for ganzfeld experiments, and they jointly specified what those standards should be.|$|E
25|$|On {{the next}} day, Peck's train was ambushed {{again in the}} same area as before. This time, the Chinese had torn up about 400 yards or the {{railroad}} tracks, and the workers sent to <b>fix</b> <b>them</b> had been killed or wounded by land mines. Since it was expected that repair work on the railroad would take at least two days, Peck returned to Tangshan and boarded an observation plane, in order to fly to Chinwangtao. The Kuyeh incident demonstrated the need for a strong Nationalist offensive action to clear the railroad line, and to arrange this, General Peck was authorized to deal directly with Lieutenant General Tu Li-ming, who was the commanding general in the Northeast China Command. Li-ming agreed to drive back the Communists and avoid Marine positions while doing so, in order to keep American forces out of the conflict. The Marines, in turn, would help release Nationalist troops for the operation by assuming responsibility for guarding all rail bridges over 100 meters long between Tangku and Chinwangtao, a distance of approximately 135 miles. Even before taking on these new responsibilities, the 7th Marines was short on manpower. As a result, 1st Battalion, 29th Marines, 6th Division, was transferred from Tsingtao to Hopeh and placed under the 7th Marines' operational control.|$|E

500|$|The Age of Reason, {{despite having}} been {{written for the}} French, made very little, if any, impact on revolutionary France. Paine wrote that [...] "the people of France were running headlong into atheism and I had the work {{translated}} into their own language, to stop them in that career, and <b>fix</b> <b>them</b> to the first article [...] [...] [...] of every man's creed who has any creed at all – I believe in God" [...] (emphasis Paine's). Paine's arguments were already common and accessible in France; they had, in a sense, already been rejected.|$|E
500|$|In March 2016, news sources {{reported}} {{that despite the}} station's high cost, the station had maintenance problems: there were leaks in {{the ceiling of the}} corridors holding the escalators, the station's bathrooms were closed because of flooding from the street, and icicles had formed on the ceiling of the station. The MTA supposedly knew about the issues for several years, even during construction. The MTA board called these issues [...] "unacceptable" [...] and the contractor responsible for waterproofing the station spent $3 million to <b>fix</b> <b>them.</b> The leaky ceiling was reportedly fixed by May 2016. At least one passenger filed a lawsuit against the MTA because of injuries sustained after falling down an escalator to avoid the leaky ceiling.|$|E

500|$|Exquemelin {{wrote that}} in order to take the third castle, Morgan ordered the {{construction}} of ladders wide enough for three men to climb abreast; when they were completed he [...] "commanded all the religious men and women whom he had taken prisoners to <b>fix</b> <b>them</b> against the walls of the castle... these were forced, {{at the head of the}} companies to raise and apply them to the walls... Thus many of the religious men and nuns were killed". Terry Breverton, in his biography of Morgan, writes that when a translation of Exquemelin's book was published in England, Morgan sued for libel and won. The passage about the use of nuns and monks as a human shield was retracted from subsequent publications in England.|$|E
500|$|Attending a play {{being held}} at the Little Clam Pre-School about Terri Schiavo, the Griffin family wait eagerly to see Stewie appear in the {{starring}} role as [...] "The Plug." [...] Succumbing to stage fright, however, Stewie wets himself, and begins crying, with Peter recording it all on video tape. Panning the camera down to another row in the auditorium, Peter notices actor Richard Dreyfuss, and begins recording him, while pestering him with personal questions. Deciding to sell the video to TMZ, Peter quickly becomes enthralled with being a Paparazzi, and decides to buy a professional-grade video camera. He then begins recording other town celebrities, including Tom Tucker, Mayor Adam West, and Ollie Williams, the latter whom smashes Peter's camera, {{as well as his}} glasses. Unable to <b>fix</b> <b>them</b> in time for work the next day, he decides to wear contacts instead. Once he arrives at work, his boss, Angela, notices something different about his appearance and develops a sexual attraction for him. Angela begins hitting on Peter, enlisting him to do various odd sexual favors for her. This culminates in her inviting Peter to her house one evening, which Peter realizes as an attempt to have sex with him. Peter fears of going against her will result in being fired, and agrees to visit Angela. He then enlists his neighbor, Quagmire, to go with him, and hides inside Peter's clothing, planning to have sex with Angela, in the place of Peter. He soon backs out, however, when he finds Angela to be unattractive, leading Peter to have to refuse to have sex with her, and eventually being fired from his job.|$|E

2500|$|Trouble {{was much}} more themed on Christianity than their debut, {{although}} its nature was philosophical rather than spiritual. Characterized by James Carter, [...] "The last album, we wrote about our everyday lives... {{the majority of the}} songs were about skateboarding and stories we made up. This album, pretty much every song is about Christianity." [...] The band leveled criticism at the church and Christians generally, sometimes using sarcasm, reminding one reviewer of Steve Taylor. [...] "Tip from Me" [...] is about breaking broad perceptions of Christianity and the Church. The purpose of the song was to acknowledge problems with the church, say to the non-Christian that [...] "Yeah, we see the problems too," [...] and a call to the Christian to act to <b>fix</b> <b>them.</b> In the song [...] "Stupid" [...] the band used the example of abortion clinic bombings (see, for example Eric Robert Rudolph) to make a pronounced statement about hypocrisy.|$|E
