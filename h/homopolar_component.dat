40|$|A novel three {{dimensional}} space vector algorithm of multilevel converters for compensating harmonics and <b>homopolar</b> <b>component</b> in {{system with}} neutral is presented. This generalized method provides an online computation {{of the nearest}} switching vectors sequence to the reference vector and calculates the on-state durations of the respective switching state vectors without involving trigonometric functions, look-up tables or coordinate system transformations which increase the computational load corresponding to the modulation of multilevel converters. The low computational cost of the proposed method {{is always the same}} and it is independent of the number of levels of the converter. The conventional 2 D space vector algorithms are particular cases of the proposed generalized modulation algorithm. The algorithm provides the switching sequence that minimizes the total harmonic distortion and the commutation number of the semiconductor devices...|$|E

40|$|For {{electrical}} network energetically states analysis is adopting the following initial hypothesis: the system sources determine in terminals a voltage symmetrical {{system and the}} asymmetry, in different nodes of the network, {{is determined by the}} unequal loads over the system phases due to the unbalanced consumers or by the different impedances over the electrical energy transport and distribution network phases. In this way, even in case of an unbalanced consumer, the energy transfer over the energetically system lines, leads to the unsymmetrical states appearance. Were used in the study the following calculus relations for unsymmetrical state: Stokvis-Fortescue, Amounts iterative method, The maximum deviation reported to the medium value, GOST, GOST with error, Robert-Marquet and Geometrically method.

40|$|The {{detection}} of the neutral point voltage of three-phase synchronous reluctance motors {{is useful for}} obtaining information on the operating conditions of the motor and also on the Fourier coefficients of the air gap permeance. It is known that these parameters are crucial for the accurate evaluation of the motor’s main quantities. Modelling the motor so as {{to take into account}} of the harmonics of both magneto-motive force and air gap permeance, the <b>homopolar</b> <b>component</b> of the induced voltages is obtained. It is shown that amplitude and phase of each harmonic of the homopolar voltage can be expressed as a function of two Fourier coefficients of air gap permeance, which suggests using a procedure for on-line calculating these coefficients. The parameters of a small prototype of reluctance motor have identified using a seven bit digitizing oscilloscope connected to a digital computer in which a DFT algorithm has been implemented for evaluating amplitude and phase of the harmonics of neutral point voltage...|$|E
40|$|The {{single-phase}} and two-phase {{versions of}} AC motors can be modelled {{by means of}} the two-axis (d-q) theory with sufficient accuracy when the equivalent circuit parameters are correctly estimated. This work attempts to present a unified approach to the analytical prediction of the electromagnetic torque of these machines. Classical d-q axes formulation requires that the reference frame should be fixed on the frame where the asymmetries arise, i. e. the stator and rotor. The asynchronous torques that characterize the induction motors are modelled in a stationary reference frame, where the d-q axes coincide with the physical magnetic axes of the stator windings. For the permanent magnet motors, that may exhibit asymmetries on both stator and rotor, the proposed solution includes: a series of frame transformations, followed by symmetrical components decomposition. As in single-phase and two-phase systems the <b>homopolar</b> <b>component</b> is zero; each symmetrical component – negative and positive – is further analysed using d-q axes theory. The superposition principle is employed to consider the magnets and rotor cage effects. The developed models account for the most important asymmetries of the motor configuration. These are, from the stator point of view, different distribution, conductors' dimensions and number of effective turns, non-orthogonal magnetic axes windings and from the rotor point of view, asymmetrical rotor cage, variable reluctance, and permanent magnets effect. The time and space harmonics effect is ignored. Test data are compared with the computed data in order to observe how the simplifying assumptions affect the level of accuracy. The analytical prediction methods make possible torque computation according {{to the nature of the}} torque being computed, namely, induction, reluctance and excitation (permanent magnet). The results are available for quasi steady-state, steady-state (rated or synchronous speed) and dynamic analyses. All the developed mathematical models can be used in preliminary design for further optimisation and accurate estimation in complex numerical models. Another important feature of the analytical models for single-phase and two-phase AC motors, is that they can be directly implemented in any suitable electrical drives control strategy. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{different}} procedures {{that can be}} applied to diagnose the severity degree of rotor faults in closed loop controlled induction machines. A solution based on field oriented control (FOC) was investigated in order to validate the robustness of the diagnostic procedures towards the regulator parameters. Different diagnostic procedures were investigated, that rely on different diagnostic indexes. Specifically a few electric quantities are considered as possible fault alert signals: the spectral analysis of manipulated and controlled variables, the voltage <b>homopolar</b> <b>components</b> (voltage zero sequence), and the spectral analysis of motor input current due to a high frequency voltage injection. It turns out that the last quantity is a simple and effective index able to detect and quantify the fault severity degree. The procedures based on the above mentioned quantities are validated by experiments made with a DSP based current controlled voltage source inverter (CCVSI) supplying an induction machine with three rotors in different health conditions...|$|R

The proposed system is appropriate for wind-diesel schemes or any other application where a path for the circulation of zero sequence currents is required, e. g. wind energy conversion systems feeding isolated loads, small portable diesel generators used in ambulances and similar emergency vehicles, wind hybrid generation systems, wind-diesel schemes, etc. In this work {{it is assumed that}} the 4 -leg MC is fed from a variable speed diesel-driven Permanent Magnet (PM) generator. A vector control system based in two synchronous rotating d-q axes is used to regulate the load voltage. The frames are rotating clockwise and counter-clockwise respectively in order to control the positive and negative sequence of the output signals. A separate resonant controller is used to regulate the <b>homopolar</b> <b>components</b> of the load voltage.

40|$|The use of {{multiphase}} motor drives, i. e., with a phase number {{higher than}} three, is {{an increasingly important}} trend nowadays. The common procedure to analyze or to design the control algorithm for multiphase motors {{is to use a}} decoupling transformation method that transforms the model from the original phase-variable reference frame, where the electrical variables are cross-coupled, into a model decoupled in orthogonal subspaces. One of such transformations is the vector space decomposition (VSD), in which each variable is represented by a complex number called spatial vector. When the multiphase induction motor model is decoupled by means of the VSD, different types of subspaces are obtained. The main type of subspace is the one where there is coupling between the rotor and the stator, i. e., the electromechanical energy conversion happens. There are other types of subspaces {{in which there is no}} coupling between the stator and the rotor; these planes do not produce electromechanical energy conversion and their impedance can be very high (in case of <b>homopolar</b> <b>components</b> with isolated neutral points) or low...|$|R

A new current decomposition is proposed in order to derive the direct, inverse, and <b>homopolar</b> current <b>components.</b> The average and oscillating terms of powers in the frame are separated by using four Adaline neural networks. The Adalines use a cosine and sine as inputs in order to learn the linear combination of the powers. The resulting symmetrical components are used by three other Adalines for phase-angle estimation between direct and inverse current components. These phase angles permit classifying the fault types.
