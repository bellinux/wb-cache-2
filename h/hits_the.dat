2500|$|When a player's shot hits their {{opponent}} {{prior to}} <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> front wall, interference has occurred. If {{the ball was}} travelling towards the side wall when it <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> opponent, or if it had already <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> side wall and was travelling directly to the front wall, it is usually a let. [...] However, it is a stroke to <b>the</b> player who <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ball if the ball was travelling straight to the front wall when <b>the</b> ball <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> opponent, without having first <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> side wall. Generally after a player has been <b>hit</b> by <b>the</b> ball, both players stand still; if the struck player is standing {{directly in front of}} <b>the</b> player who <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ball he loses the stroke, if he is not straight in front, a let is played. If it is deemed that the player who is striking the ball is deliberately trying to hit his opponent, he will lose the stroke. An exception to all of this occurs when <b>the</b> player <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> ball has [...] "turned", i.e., let the ball pass him on one side, but then <b>hit</b> it on <b>the</b> other side as it came off the back wall. In these cases, the stroke goes to the player who was <b>hit</b> by <b>the</b> ball.|$|R
