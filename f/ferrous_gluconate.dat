The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the absorption and side effects of high doses ferrous sulphate and <b>ferrous</b> <b>gluconate</b> in PD patients. Methods. Blood samples were taken from 29 PD patients at baseline, as well as 2, 4 and 8 hours after oral intake of 4 ferrous sulphate tablets (containing 105 mg elemental iron per tablet). The test was repeated using 8 <b>ferrous</b> <b>gluconate</b> drinkable ampoules (containing 50 mg elemental iron per ampoule). Results. The maximal increase in serum iron level during the test with iron sulphate was 113. 51 ± 103. 37 % versus the initial values of 183. 87 ± 37. 38 % during the <b>ferrous</b> <b>gluconate</b> test. The maximal values of serum iron after the intake of ferrous sulphate were 26. 23 ± 9. 95 µmol/l versus 30. 97 ± 8. 65 µmol/l after the intake of <b>ferrous</b> <b>gluconate.</b> There was a statistically significant difference between these two groups.

40|$|Iron {{deficiency}} anaemia {{is one of}} {{the most}} prevalent nutritional deficiency disorders in the world. Food iron fortification is a widely used strategy to reduce the risk of deficiency but presents a major challenge to the food industry. The more bioavailable forms of iron, such as <b>ferrous</b> <b>gluconate,</b> cause adverse organoleptic changes when added to foods. The primary aim of the work described in this thesis was to test whether alginate would bind soluble forms of iron and thereby maintain its bioavailability. Initial in vitro studies demonstrated that alginate solutions and beads loaded with <b>ferrous</b> <b>gluconate</b> delivered iron in an available form for uptake into Caco- 2 cells (measured by ferritin formation). A human study was undertaken to assess the bioavailability of <b>ferrous</b> <b>gluconate</b> in alginate beads, and it was found to be significantly lower than <b>ferrous</b> <b>gluconate</b> on its own, so further in vitro studies were undertaken to examine possible reasons for the inhibitory effect of the beads. It was concluded that alginate beads, containing calcium as a gelling agent, are not an effective delivery vehicle for soluble iron compounds. However, these findings should not rule out the potential use of alginates as a delivery system for iron, especially in diets containing high levels of phytate. Other related work reported in this thesis includes studies of iron availability from two wheat cultivars with varying phytate and iron concentrations, potential use of nicotianamine and 2 '- deoxymugineic acid as iron enhancers, and investigations into calcium-iron interactions in a Caco- 2 cell model, with the use of live cell imaging techniques and confocal microscopy...|$|E

A human study was undertaken {{to test the hypothesis}} that alginate enhances iron absorption. A randomised, single blinded, cross-over trial was carried out in which iron absorption was measured from serum iron appearance after a test meal. Overnight-fasted volunteers (n = 15) were given a test meal of 200 g cola-flavoured jelly plus 21 mg iron as <b>ferrous</b> <b>gluconate,</b> either in alginate beads mixed into the jelly or in a capsule. Iron absorption was lower from the alginate beads than from <b>ferrous</b> <b>gluconate</b> (8. 5 % and 12. 6 % respectively, p = 0. 003). Sub-group B (n = 9) consumed the test meals together with 600 mg calcium to determine whether alginate modified the inhibitory effect of calcium. Calcium reduced iron absorption from <b>ferrous</b> <b>gluconate</b> by 51 %, from 11. 5 % to 5. 6 % (p = 0. 014), and from alginate beads by 37 %, from 8. 3 % to 5. 2 % (p = 0. 009). In vitro studies using Caco- 2 cells were designed to explore the reasons for the difference between the previous in vitro findings and the human study; confirmed the inhibitory effect of alginate. Beads similar to those used in the human study were subjected to simulated gastrointestinal digestion, with and without cola jelly, and the digestate applied to Caco- 2 cells. Both alginate and cola jelly significantly reduced iron uptake into the cells, by 34 % (p = 0. 009) and 35 % (p = 0. 003) respectively. The combination of cola jelly and calcium produced a very low ferritin response, 16. 5 % (p < 0. 001) of that observed with <b>ferrous</b> <b>gluconate</b> alone.

This work comparatively assessed the bioavailability of two forms of iron, <b>ferrous</b> <b>gluconate</b> or ferric pyrophosphate encapsulated in liposomes (lipofer), when used as fortificants in meat pate. Three groups of growing rats consumed during 28 days either a control diet (AIN- 93 G), or two diets prepared with enriched pate as the unique source of iron and fat. Body weight and diet intake were measured weekly, and {{during the last week}} faeces were collected. On day 28 animals were sacrificed, livers and spleens were removed and stored. Haemoglobin and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) were determined. There were not significant differences among the three groups in body weight and apparent iron absorption, although food intake in the two pate groups was significantly higher compared to the control group. There were not differences in liver and spleen iron content and concentration, neither in haemoglobin and TIBC values. These results indicated that iron bioavailability of pate enriched with <b>ferrous</b> <b>gluconate</b> or ferric pyrophosphate encapsulated in liposomes was similar, and thus both sources of iron are good candidates to be used as fortifiers in meat based products.

The effect of inhibitor concentration was investigated. The concentration of these inhibitor ranges from 0. 5 to 2. 0 % g/v at a temperature of 28 OC. The synergetic effect of these inhibitors was also studied. High resolution scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (HR-SEM/EDS) and Raman spectroscopy was used to characterize the surface morphology of the metals before and after corrosion. Experimental results revealed that <b>ferrous</b> <b>gluconate</b> and zinc gluconate in 3. 5 % NaCl and 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4 solution decreased the corrosion rate at the different concentrations studied. Maximum inhibition efficiency of 100 % was achieved for mild steel at 0. 5 % g/v concentration of FG, 0. 5 % g/v concentration of ZG and 1. 5 % g/v synergetic of FG + ZG in 3. 5 % NaCl solution.

40|$|The {{bioavailability}} of iron in New Zealand beef either {{alone or}} {{as part of}} a 'typical' New Zealand meal was investigated. The solubility of iron and its in vitro absorption by mouse intestinal tissue were used to evaluate iron bioavailability. The solubility of haem and/or non-haem iron in meat (beef longissimus muscle), vegetables and meat-plus-vegetables was investigated. Samples were cooked and then subjected to in vitro gastrointestinal digestion with pepsin followed by a combination of pancreatic enzymes and bile. Cooking at 65 °C for 90 minutes reduced the soluble iron concentration in meat by 81 % and reduced the haem iron concentration by 27 %, which coincided with a 175 % increase in non-haem iron concentrations. However, gastrointestinal digestion increased the solubility of iron in cooked meat (333 %), vegetables (367 %) and meat-plus-vegetables (167 %). A proportion (35 %) of the haem iron in the meat was broken down by the action of pancreatic enzymes leading to a 46 % increase in non-haem iron concentrations, although {{this was not the case}} for the meat-plus-vegetables. Validation studies showed that mouse intestinal segments mounted in Ussing chambers maintained integrity and viability, and were responsive to glucose, theophylline and carbachol. Intestinal tissue from iron deficient mice was then used in the Ussing chambers to investigate the absorption of iron from <b>ferrous</b> <b>gluconate</b> and the soluble fractions of meat, vegetables and meat-plus-vegetables after gastrointestinal digestion. Results indicated a trend towards a higher absorption of iron from meat and <b>ferrous</b> <b>gluconate,</b> compared to vegetables and meat-plus-vegetables. However, iron absorption results were difficult to interpret due to the wide variation in the data. This variation was possibly due to errors associated with the sample processing and the analysis of iron, which was by inductively coupled-mass spectroscopy. Overall, the present study showed that before estimations can be made on the bioavailability of food iron, the effects of the cooking and gastrointestinal digestion processes must be considered. Further, the use of in vitro gastrointestinal digestion followed by the use of Ussing chambers to assess intestinal absorption is a potentially valuable system for assessing mineral bioavailability...|$|E

40|$|The {{collection}} of blood or blood components is mandatory for securing patients’ medical care. A large number of regular blood donors develop an iron deficiency, which leads to deferral from blood donation. Temporary deferral has a strong influence on donor contentment and often results in a more rapid loss of these donors. Not least there is the ethical responsibility for protecting donors’ health. This leads to the necessity of providing donors with oral iron supplementation, but the exact dose of iron required for compensating the iron loss from whole-blood donation is not yet known. As part of a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind trial 621 regular blood donors (366 male and 255 female) were examined. The study participants {{were randomly assigned to}} treatment with either 0 mg, 20 mg of elemental iron as <b>ferrous</b> <b>gluconate</b> or 20 mg of elemental iron <b>ferrous</b> <b>gluconate</b> plus 400 mg ascorbic acid. In total there were three visits in intervals of eight weeks (males) or twelve weeks (females) on which whole blood should be collected. Hemoglobin levels, serum ferritin, and hemoglobin content of reticulocytes and red blood cells (RET-He and RBC-He) were measured before each donation. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate if an overall dose of 600 mg of elemental iron is sufficient for fully compensating the iron loss from whole-blood donation and avoiding the emptying of body iron stores in male and female blood donors. Furthermore it should be examined if there is any benefit by additional administration of ascorbic acid to the donor. In conclusion an overall dose of 600 mg of elemental iron per day seems not appropriate to fully compensate the iron loss due to whole- blood donation at intervals of eight weeks in males and at intervals of twelve weeks in females. This result was unaffected by whether ascorbic acid was given additionally or not. Nevertheless a positive effect of oral iron supplementation on body iron stores was found. A small part (2, 5 %) of the participants who received iron had severe gastrointestinal side effects which led to a drop out. In this study the overall drop out-rate in both male and female was higher than the estimated rate of 40 %. Therefore the results of this study have to be critically evaluated. A standardized protocol for oral iron substitution blood donors is urgently needed to reassure supplying the population with blood products in the future. However, further research is necessary to set the appropriate dose and the ideal interval for such standardized substitution...|$|E
40|$|Radioactive iron as <b>ferrous</b> <b>gluconate</b> {{given by}} vein {{enables us to}} study iron {{excretion}} in urine, bile, and feces. There is an initial extra output in urine and feces during a few days (3 to 15 days) following the iron injection and this may total 2 to 8 per cent of the injected iron. Following this initial reaction the urinary excretion of radio-iron drops to traces or even to zero. The feces always contain measurable amounts of radio-iron—in five dogs receiving 100 to 250 mg. of radio-iron the fecal excretion per day settled down to 0. 05 to 0. 4 mg. per day. Blood destruction (acetyl-phenylhydrazine) causes a definite increase in radio-iron eliminated in the feces (0. 1 to 1. 0 mg. per day). Probably most of this excess iron comes through the biliary tract (bile fistula). The bile under usual conditions contributes very little iron to the intestine (0. 01 mg. radio-iron per day or less). The body controls its iron stores by absorption {{or lack of it}} rather than by its capacity to eliminate it. The evidence is overwhelming that the dog excretes iron with difficulty and in small amounts (even in the plethoric state) by means of the biliary and gastro-intestinal tracts...|$|E
