40|$|Property {{rights of}} {{copyright}} (economic copyright) Abstract Intellectual Property Law as {{a branch of}} Private Law comprises two categories of rights - <b>industrial</b> <b>property</b> <b>and</b> <b>copyright</b> in a broader sense. In my thesis I focus on that part of Copyright Law which deals with rights to the author's work (i. e. copyright in the strict sense), specifically property rights of copyright (economic copyright). This thesis therefore provides a comprehensive explanation of property rights, which {{would not be possible}} without a brief explanation of the subject, development, concept and content of copyright. I also pay attention to legal regulation of the license agreement, which is a separate type of contract under the Copyright Act. Finally there is the collective management of copyright explained in my thesis. With respect to the importance of copyright which increases over time in response to the rapid development of information technologies, there is a need of its consistent protection and acceptance of more detailed and rigorous legislation. A numerous instruments of International Law and EU Law (whose main purpose is to harmonize national provisions of the Member States; the Czech Republic {{is a member of the}} European Union since 2004) therefore plays an important role in the harmonization of the national provisions [...] ...|$|E
40|$|As {{creations of}} the mind, {{intellectual}} <b>property</b> includes <b>industrial</b> <b>property</b> <b>and</b> <b>copyrights.</b> This paper presents an aggregate production {{function of the}} generalized Fechner-Thurstone (GFT) form to analyze the impact of {{an important component of}} intellectual <b>industrial</b> <b>property,</b> namely patent activity, on technical change in the USA for the period 1947 - 1981. Patents should alter isoquant maps, and measuring their elasticities is both intuitively and empirically appealing. We define a technology-changer as a variable that has an impact on the elasticity of the marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS) between inputs of the GFT production function over time. Various types of US patent grant activity, specifically total, domestic, foreign, successful and unsuccessful patent applications, are used as instruments for the technology-changer. Using the GFT specification, the impacts of various technology-changers on the elasticity of the mrts between inputs are estimated directly. It is found that granted (or successful) patents, patents granted to foreign companies and individuals, total patent applications, and even unsuccessful patent applications, have significant impacts on the rates at whic...|$|R

During his term, he was able to establish programs that were significant to the field of S&T. In 1993, Science and Technology Agenda for National Development (STAND) was established. Among its priorities were: (1) exporting winners identified by the DTI; (2) domestic needs identified by the President's Council for Countryside Development; (3) support industries and (4) coconut industry development. Congress, during his term, was able to enact laws that were significant for the field.

40|$|The incentives-for-authors {{formulation}} of copyright’s purpose is so deeply ingrained in our discourse and our thought processes {{that it is}} astonishingly hard to avoid invoking, even when one is consciously trying not to do so. Yet avoiding that formulation {{is exactly what we}} ought to be doing. Everything we know about creativity and creative processes suggests that copyright plays very little role in motivating creative work. In the contemporary information society, the purpose of copyright is to enable the provision of capital and organization so that creative work may be exploited. And the choice of copyright as a principal means of promoting cultural production has consequences for the content of culture as well. This reframing has four important consequences for debates about <b>copyright</b> law <b>and</b> policy. First, abandoning the incentives-for-authors story requires us to talk about cultural progress differently. The incentives-for-authors story has functioned as a smokescreen, enabling scholars, judges, and legislators to conflate economic and creative motivation. Severing the motivational link between creativity and economics requires us to come up with a better understanding of how cultural progress emerges, and a more accurate account of how the economic incentives that copyright provides affect progress more generally. Second, an account of copyright as incentives-for-capital suggests a different approach to conceptualizing the kind of “property” that copyright represents. Copyright scholars habitually compare copyright to property in land, a conceptual move that passes over an important stage in the evolution of economic activity and associated economic rights. There are important benefits to be gained from comparing post-industrial, information <b>property</b> to <b>industrial,</b> corporate <b>property,</b> <b>and</b> <b>copyright</b> law more explicitly to corporate law. Specifically, copyright law in the post-industrial era works to separate authorship from control of creative works so that a set of coordination and governance problems closely associated with information resources can be solved. Third, comparing copyright more explicitly to <b>industrial,</b> corporate <b>property</b> <b>and</b> legal regimes governing its use suggests some different ways of thinking and talking about problems of social welfare that so often bedevil regimes of property law. Fourth, comparing copyright more explicitly to <b>industrial,</b> corporate <b>property</b> foregrounds copyright law’s (largely unrealized) potential to function as a tool for ensuring accountability to the authors without whom the copyright system could not function...|$|R
40|$|Creativity and {{innovation}} within the European Union {{are part of}} a harmonized system of protection of intellectual property rights (IPRs); the latter include legal tools such as <b>industrial</b> <b>property</b> rights <b>and</b> <b>copyright</b> <b>and</b> related rights. The fundamental principles of the internal market (free movement of goods and services and free competition) are based in particular on the harmonization of IPRs at the European level. The protection of intellectual property is subject to a number of international conventions, the supervision of which is largely up to the World Intellectual <b>Property</b> Organization (WIPO) <b>and</b> the World Trade Organisation (WTO). To fulfil its obligations in the area, the European Union has created the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (OHIM), in charge of the registration of European trademarks and European designs. The Commission is currently engaged in the effective implementation of a common EU patent system, less costly and more effective from a legal point of view, able to ensure the competitiveness of European business and enterprises. Finally, the protection of IPRs also implies that they must be safeguarded against piracy, illegal trade and counterfeiting. The Internet and digital technologies play a pivotal role in this context, since they are transforming the world we live in, with reference to all the aspects of life and all sectors of activity. EU must embrace this digital revolution and open new digital opportunities for citizens and business, by leveraging the strength of the EU single market. The existence of barriers to online activities prevents citizens from taking advantage of a wider range of goods and services. Therefore companies and public administrations cannot reap the benefits of digital tools. The final scope of the Digital Single Market (DSM) aims at breaking down regulatory barriers in order to establish a single market, in place of the partially harmonized 28 national markets now existing. This research report is aimed at identifying and analysing the possible barriers that the European citizens/digital service users face in enjoying their rights when they aim to access to online cultural contents. In light of this, DSM strategy of the European Commission has been taken as a point of reference for pintpointing the legal and factual barriers, describing what are the reform projects in progress and outlining some possible, future (policy) solutions...|$|R

40|$|<b>INDUSTRIAL</b> <b>PROPERTY</b> PROTECTION <b>AND</b> INTERNATIONAL LAW The {{object of}} the thesis is an {{overview}} of contemporary issues in a domain of <b>industrial</b> <b>property</b> <b>and</b> protection given by national and international law. The <b>industrial</b> <b>property</b> contains an extensive category of the <b>industrial</b> <b>property</b> rights. We can divided them into category of rights to results of creative work (patents, utility models, industrial designs) and category of rights to the sign (trademarks and geographical indications). Owing to extensive scope of <b>industrial</b> <b>property</b> the thesis is focused only on a field of the patents and trademarks. The thesis is divided into four main parts. First part deals with statutory regulation of the patents. There are defined requirements of the granting patents for new technical solutions. Furthermore there is described the proceeding of the <b>Industrial</b> <b>property</b> Office <b>and</b> its examination whether the invention complies all requirements of patentability. Thesis describes a system of national protection of inventions that is granted only for the area limited by the state boarder.
