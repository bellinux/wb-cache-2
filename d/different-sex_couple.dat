5000|$|.....the Court’s {{case-law}} {{has only}} accepted that {{the emotional and}} sexual relationship of a same-sex couple constitutes “private life” but has not found that it constitutes “family life”, even where a long term relationship of cohabiting partners was at stake. In coming to that conclusion, the Court observed that despite the growing tendency {{in a number of}} European States towards the legal and judicial recognition of stable de facto partnerships between gay people, given the existence oflittle common ground between the Contracting States, this was an area in which they still enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation.(...) The Court notes that (...) a rapid evolution of social attitudes towards same-sex couples has taken place in many member States. Since then a considerable number of member States have afforded legal recognition to same-sex couples (see above, paragraphs 27-30). Certain provisions of EU law also reflect a growing tendency to include same-sex couples in the notion of “family”(...).In view of this evolution the Court considers it artificial to maintain the view that, in contrast to a <b>different-sex</b> <b>couple,</b> a same-sex couple cannot enjoy “family life” for the purposes of Article 8. Consequently the relationship of the applicants, a cohabiting same-sex couple living in a stable de facto partnership, falls within the notion of “family life”, just as the relationship of a <b>different-sex</b> <b>couple</b> in the same situation would." ...|$|E
40|$|Since Badgett 2 ̆ 7 s (1995 a) {{landmark}} {{study on}} the wage effects of sexual orientation, interest in and production of scholarly work addressing the economics of sexual orientation has grown tremendously. Curious puzzles have emerged {{in the literature on}} the economics of same-sex couple households, three of which are addressed in detail in this dissertation. Most studies of the wages of women in same-sex couples versus different-sex couples find that the former earn more, even controlling for differences in present labor market supply, education, experience, area of residence, and occupation. However, most previous studies of the sexual orientation wage gap omit the role of motherhood in the lesbian-straight women wage gap, and most take the sample of lesbians to be a homogenous group compared to straight women. Chapter 1 uses American Community Survey data from 2010 to study the wage gap between lesbians and straight women, putting motherhood in intra-household differences {{at the center of the}} analysis. The analysis shows that in terms of earnings, lesbian couples are quite heterogeneous; one partner has a large wage premium over straight women, and the other faces a large wage penalty. These findings are enhanced when a child is present in the lesbians 2 ̆ 7 home, possibly suggesting a household division of labor in lesbian homes. Chapter 2 considers the possibility that same-sex couples, like many different-sex couples, have one person who specializes in paid work while the other specializes in unpaid work for the household, such as housework and childcare. Chapter 2 presents a study which uses American Time Use Survey Data pooled from 2003 - 2011 to analyze the time spent in household, care, and paid work for members of different couple types and finds that in same-sex as well as <b>different-sex</b> <b>couple</b> households, some personal characteristics, such as being the lower earner in the household, are correlated with spending more time in household and care work. Chapter 3 offers a study of poverty in same-sex versus <b>different-sex</b> <b>couple</b> households, exploring which characteristics are correlated with poverty for same-sex and <b>different-sex</b> <b>couple</b> households. When controlling for a couple 2 ̆ 7 s education level, area of residence, race and ethnicity, age, and household composition, same-sex couples are more likely to be in poverty than their different-sex counterparts. ...|$|E

Because recognizing marriages with more than two partners likely requires restructuring the legal rights and duties attached to marriage, raising difficult questions of interpersonal fairness, I conclude that ultimately there is a strong basis for distinguishing the constitutional issues raised by the same-sex marriage cases from those raised by a hypothetical challenge to two-person-only marriage laws...|$|R
