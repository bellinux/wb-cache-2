40|$|Statebuilding after {{conflict}} often entails liberal peacebuilding measures. The {{end of the}} UN {{mission in}} post-conflict Timor-Leste in December 2012 provides {{a unique opportunity to}} investigate statebuilding in practice. The liberal peacebuilding agenda has met with stiff academic resistance—mainly from the critical theorist camp—and is questioned as an appropriate measure of …statebuilding success. We deploy instead the good governance (GG) agenda as a hybrid local-liberal <b>guide.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on field work, interviews, and secondary documents, we investigate what we see as four key, intertwined and overlapping aspects of GG: state capacity including the establishment of a state bureaucracy, participation and the engagement of civil society, institution building and rule of law, and corruption control and transparency. We note GG provides a useful policy heuristic, while abstract “one-size-fits-all” liberal peacebuilding models, which avoid the complexities of machinery of government issues, the time taken to develop institutions, and historical and contextual environments of countries, are likely to face severe problems. New states may be dependent on external forces to maintain monopoly of violence.

Feedforward is a strength focused way of structuring interviews and conversations to allow participants to reflect on positive experiences, the emotions and conditions facilitated with these, and reflections on what the implications are for future goals. Such an approach to facilitation will give participants the opportunity to reflect on positive experiences and experience strengths-focused facilitation first hand, as well as actively contributing to best practice. In {{the second half of the}} workshop, we will present delegates with key summaries of data gathered from a recent DOP survey of recent graduates and current students and subsequent focus group. We will present delegates with challenges offered in the data, such as the need to balance core OP skills and professional skills within a one year curriculum, and work towards joint recommendations to address these. Objectives The objectives are to: a) Engage current MSc students and recent graduates and proactively seek their input into current DOP activities b) Use a future oriented and positively valanced approach to understanding relevant experiences c) Draw up recommendations for best practice d) Convene a fun and stimulating session which will give participants first hand experience of using ‘feedforward’ in a group setting...|$|E

40|$|Summits {{and world}} {{conferences}} can give grantees an important opportunity to contribute ideas to governments and international agencies [...] and to link with counterparts and kindred movements around the globe. This <b>guide,</b> <b>drawing</b> on grantmaker experiences, looks at how funding {{in connection with}} a summit can advance grantees' programmatic goals and help them get the most from a summit experience. Highlights Why fund {{in connection with a}} summit Working with grantees to advance their goals Supporting their efforts to engage the media effectively Understanding the debates about summits What's in the Guide? Setting the Stage: What are international summits? What can they accomplish? And what issues can be expected to arise along the way? This chapter lists a few of the opportunities and challenges that grantmakers may encounter. Why Fund in Connection with a Summit? International summits are complex and sometimes controversial events, but with immense potential value. Here, grantmakers describe some of the ways that funding in connection with a summit can advance program goals. How Some Grantmakers Prepare: Well before they make the first grant, grantmakers can prepare themselves by learning about the process, developing program goals and networking with potential partners. This section includes some preliminary actions grantmakers can take {{to get the most out}} of a summit opportunity. Working with Grantees: What kinds of activities could a grantmaker fund? From help with coalition-building, to providing funding for summit news bulletins, grantmakers offer ideas about how to support grantees and other actors before and during a summit. Engaging the Media: The quality and extent of media coverage can have a big impact on a summit's success. How can a funder help grantees prepare to work well with the media? In this section, grantmakers offer some experience and guidance on how to engage the world's eyes and ears. Beyond the Summit: Work doesn't end when a summit closes its doors. Here are examples of ways in which funders have contributed to important summit follow-up activities. The Debate about Summits: Grantmaking in connection with summits can offer short-term benefits to participants and longer-term impacts on policy. There are costs as well as benefits associated with mobilizing governments and non-governmental organizations at a worldwide gathering. So, before stepping into this arena, it's wise to understand the debate about summits. Here are issues commonly raised and how some grantmakers respond...|$|E

40|$|As a {{psychotherapist}} {{working in the}} field of eating disorders, I have a long-standing interest in accessing the subjective expertise of a wider group of sufferers, including what it is like {{and what it means to}} suffer from anorexia, the factors that help to support recovery and the role psychotherapy plays in contributing towards the recovery process. This study provides a timely addition to the literature on the nature and role of psychotherapy as a treatment for anorexia. Studies that explore the sufferer’s understanding and experience of developing anorexia are extremely limited and a gap exists in examining the role of psychotherapy from the recipient’s position and the ways in which psychotherapy supports an individual's recovery process. However, as this thesis demonstrates, people who have suffered and recovered from anorexia hold valuable information on the factors that support recovery and their expertise as recipients of psychotherapy has much to teach clinicians and researchers in the field of eating disorders. The theoretical foundation of this study conceptualises experience in relation to its narration. I recruited twelve participants drawn from across Scotland who provided narrative data during a focus group and a semi structured individual interview. Participants provided experiential accounts on developing anorexia, on recovery and the role of psychotherapy in their recovery process. A phenomenological approach to data analysis was deployed using Smith et al’s (2009) Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) as a methodological <b>guide.</b> <b>Drawing</b> upon an IPA methodology I identified a number of central themes. Within accounts of developing anorexia, themes relating to interpersonal attachment, trauma and/or identity played a central role in the illness beliefs and experiences of participants. Within accounts of recovery, participants offered two main framings. The first defined recovery as an achievable completion point, signally the end of illness. The second defined recovery as an on-going process concerned more with the management of anorexia than the elimination of it. Factors that support recovery included those that are integral to the individual participant as well as those that are made available by their environment. In accounts of the role of psychotherapy, a number of common factors across participants’ experiences of psychotherapy were identified spanning support, learning and action factors. In addition, the quality of the therapeutic relationship with the psychotherapist played a crucial role in supporting the recovery process. I argue that participant beliefs about and experiences of recovery directly relate to their understandings and perceptions about what precipitated anorexia. Recovery took place when changes could be made in relation to these significant themes and psychotherapy was most effective when it addressed these issues as part of the psychotherapy process. The findings from this study point to the importance of working with the subjective understandings and beliefs sufferers have about their illness experience as a key objective within psychotherapy practice. They also underline the significance of a strong therapeutic relationship as a key component of the recovery process...|$|E
40|$|Jacques de Vitry († 1240), a noted preacher in Brabant and Languedoc, {{served as}} canon regular of Saint-Nicholas d’Oignies (1211 - 16), bishop of Acre (1216 - 29) and {{auxiliary}} bishop of Liège (1226 - 29), and ultimately as cardinal-bishop of Tusculum (1229 - 1240). Whilst his letters, sermons, and the Historia Occidentalis have been extensively studied, the Historia Orientalis, Jacques’s encyclopedic {{work on the}} Holy Land, has so far escaped any such interest. Considered as yet another crusading history or pilgrimage <b>guide</b> <b>drawing</b> on previous writings, the few editions and brief studies of this work published since the nineteenth century are based neither on a detailed textual analysis nor on a complete investigation of the manuscript tradition. 	This thesis, therefore, addresses an important gap in the historiographical debate by providing {{a detailed analysis of}} the contents of the Historia Orientalis and its sources, in combination with an examination of the manuscript tradition up to the early fourteenth century. In it, I argue that the work is composed of different genres, each addressing a topic that served Jacques’s agenda and his activities as theologian, preacher, historian, pilgrim, and crusader. Moreover, by examining the rich manuscript tradition, I establish the book’s legacy and show that Jacques’s contemporaries perceived the text as an eclectic work. Jacques’s combination of different popular genres contributed to the influence of the text which is preserved in no fewer than 126 extant manuscripts. 	The thesis falls into three sections. In the first, I introduce my investigation and provide a long overdue revised biographical note and contextualisation of Jacques’s writings. In the four chapters of the second section, I analyse the text to see how Jacques combined the editing of existing source material with his personal knowledge into a work that served the reform and crusade agenda of the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215. The four chapters discuss the medieval genres that can be found in Jacques’s work: a history of the crusades, an account on Islam, a description of the Holy Land, and an ethnographical treatise. In the third section, using codicological research to discuss the text’s compilation, influence, readership, and legacy in the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, I argue that each genre found within the Historia was intended for and read by a different audience, thus explaining the wide appeal of the work as a whole. The sixth chapter focuses on the early manuscript tradition and dissemination of the Historia Orientalis while the seventh chapter addresses, on the one hand, the use of these manuscripts and the relationship to other texts in the same codex and, on the other hand, the authors who copied or used Jacques’s text in their own works. 	By combining a detailed textual analysis with extensive manuscript research, this investigation into the contents, readership and legacy of the Historia Orientalis sheds new light on the mechanisms behind the dissemination and influence of religious propaganda, as well as highlights Jacques’s seminal contribution to Church reform and the approach to crusading in the thirteenth century in accordance with the agenda set by the Fourth Lateran Council...|$|E
