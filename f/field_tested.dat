40|$|Abstract — <b>Field</b> <b>testing</b> of {{software}} {{is necessary to}} find potential user problems before market deployment. The large number of users involved in <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> along with the variety of problems reported by them increases the complexity of managing the <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> process. However, most <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> processes are monitored using ad-hoc techniques and simple metrics (e. g., the number of reported problems). Deeper analysis and tracking of <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> results is needed. This paper introduces visualization techniques which provide a global view of the <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> results. The techniques focus on the relation between users and their reported problems. The visualizations help identify general patterns to locate the problems. For example, the technique identifies groups of users with similar problem profiles. Such knowledge helps {{reduce the number of}} needed users since we can pick representative users. We demonstrate our proposed techniques using the <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> results for four releases of a large scale enterprise application used by millions of users worldwide...|$|R

40|$|Leg muscle {{strength}} (LMS) and leg muscle power (LMP) are determinants of aspects of functional status and important parameters for measuring intervention effects in older adults. <b>Field</b> <b>tests</b> {{are often used}} {{for the evaluation of}} LMS and LMP in older persons. However, criteria important for the application of strength and power related <b>field</b> <b>tests</b> in older adults have not been systematically taken into account and are not yet fully listed and described in a single publication. Therefore, this paper describes criteria important for the application of strength and power related <b>field</b> <b>tests</b> in older adults. In addition, strength and power related <b>field</b> <b>tests</b> commonly used in older adults are evaluated by using the described criteria. Based on this evaluation, this paper provides a perspective on the further development of <b>field</b> <b>tests.</b> Criteria important for strength and power related <b>field</b> <b>tests</b> are: adequate accuracy, precision, concurrent validity, clinical validity, practical feasibility and pure strength or power outcomes. Commonly used strength and power related <b>field</b> <b>tests</b> do not meet all the aforementioned criteria. Therefore, further development of <b>field</b> <b>tests</b> is necessary. Mobile sensing systems are potentially useful for the evaluation of LMS and LMP in older adults. Mobile sensing systems do not have the limitations of commonly used <b>field</b> <b>tests</b> and provide important additional advantages. In particular, mobile sensing systems offer the opportunity of continuous monitoring during free-movement in the home-environment, thereby reducing the need of standardized assessments by health-care professionals. Future studies should examine the clinical validity of mobile sensing systems and evaluate the application of sensor technology in exercise-based interventions...|$|R
