5|$|Often, the {{migration}} route of a long-distance migrator bird doesn't <b>follow</b> <b>a</b> straight line between breeding and wintering grounds. Rather, it could <b>follow</b> <b>a</b> hooked or arched line, with detours around geographical barriers. For most land-birds, such barriers could consist in seas, large water bodies or high mountain ranges, {{because of the}} lack of stopover or feeding sites, or the lack of thermal columns for broad-winged birds.|$|E

50|$|The {{distribution}} of X2 is a chi-squared {{distribution for the}} following reason; under the null hypothesis for test i, the p-value pi <b>follows</b> <b>a</b> uniform distribution on the interval 0,1. The negative natural logarithm of a uniformly distributed value <b>follows</b> <b>an</b> exponential distribution. Scaling <b>a</b> value that <b>follows</b> <b>an</b> exponential distribution {{by a factor of}} two yields <b>a</b> quantity that <b>follows</b> <b>a</b> chi-squared distribution with two degrees of freedom. Finally, the sum of k independent chi-squared values, each with two degrees of freedom, <b>follows</b> <b>a</b> chi-squared distribution with 2k degrees of freedom.|$|R

50|$|Arabic mathnawi {{poetry is}} called muzdawidj.

After leaving Niagara County, NY18 shifts farther south, gradually {{moving away from}} the shore of Lake Ontario. In central Orleans County, NY18 meets the Lake Ontario State Parkway at the Lakeside Beach State Park. The parkway then becomes the lakeside road, and NY18 veers south to <b>follow</b> <b>a</b> more inland routing.|$|E
5|$|Although this is {{a widely}} {{accepted}} theory for how most tornadoes form, live, and die, it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes, such as landspouts, long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vortices. These each have different mechanisms which influence their development—however, most tornadoes <b>follow</b> <b>a</b> pattern similar to this one.|$|E

Height and activity both peak when the volcano is around 500,000 years old and then rapidly decline. Eventually it goes dormant, and eventually extinct. Erosion then weathers the volcano until it again becomes a seamount.|$|E
