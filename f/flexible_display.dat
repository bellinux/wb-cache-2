The university has partnered with the Pentagon on such endeavors since 2004 with an initial $43.7million grant. In 2012, researchers at the center created the world’s largest flexible full-color organic light-emitting diode (OLED), {{which at the time}} was 7.4 inches. The following year, the FEDC staff broke their own world record, producing a 14.7-inch version of the display. The technology delivers high-performance while remaining cost-effective during the manufacturing process. Vibrant colors, high switching speeds for video and reduced power consumption are some of the features the center has been able to successfully integrate into the technology. In 2012, ASU successfully eliminated the need for specialized equipment and processing, thereby reducing costs compared to competitive approaches.|$|E
