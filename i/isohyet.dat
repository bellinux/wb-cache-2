40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of seed source (<b>isohyets</b> and half-sib families) and irrigation intervals on the stem anatomy of Acacia senegal seedlings. Twelve seed sources representing the clay soil locations across the gum belt were selected according to differences in <b>isohyets</b> and discontinuity. Seeds were collected from seven trees from each seed source. Seeds were sown in clay soil under three irrigation regimes with intervals of 3, 6 and 12 days in three replicates. After six months wood samples were cut from randomly selected seedlings representing half-sib families, <b>isohyets</b> and irrigations. Microscopic sections were prepared from the stems of each seedling and mounted on slides. Both direct measurement and stereological count techniques were used to measure the vessel characteristics and volume fraction of different types of tissues. Significant variations were found between <b>isohyets</b> in tangential diameter and average vessel diameter of solitary vessels. For cluster vessels, <b>isohyets</b> had significant effect on radial diameter, tangential diameter and average vessel diameter. Significant differences were also found in radial multiple vessels in tangential diameter and average diameter. Significant differences were found between <b>isohyets</b> in the misomorphic ratio of vessels. There were also significant differences between <b>isohyets</b> in total number of solitary vessels/mm 2 and average number of vessels in one radial multiple vessels/mm 2.

To draw these maps different methods are used such as using rainfall gradient, simple classic statistical methods and complicated Geostatistical methods like Krigging method. For this purpose, after collection of data and information related to 59 rainfall gauging stations in the study area, The dominant and maximum rainfall for durations of one to three days were selected. Then for drawing the <b>isohyets</b> maps, the relationship between rainfall and the elevation were investigated, but due to insignificant difference of this relationship, two methods of Geostatistical Krigging and inverse distance with powers of 1 to 3, were evaluated to draw the <b>isohyets</b> maps and determination of the average rainfall. To evaluate the above two methods, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was used in this research. The results of this evaluation showed that the Krigging method is better than inverse distance method for determination of average rainfall of the region. Then, by using krigging method, the <b>isohyets</b> maps of one to three -day duration and DAD curves were drawn. By using this method, conversion of point rainfall to average rainfall for an area of up to 20000 km 2 of the area under study is possible. Also, the investigation of the curves shows that the ratio of the amount of rainfall at the center to the amount of rainfall at an area of 20000 km 2 is 1. 98,. 74 and 1. 48 for durations of 1, and 3 - day, respectively...|$|R

Historical precipitation data and station elevation were obtained for stations in southern Nevada and southeastern California. Elevations for 1, 531 additional locations were obtained from topographic maps. The sample direct-variogram for the transformed variable TAAP = ln(AAP) * 1000 was fit with an isotropic, spherical model with a small nugget {{and a range of}} 190, 000 ft. The sample direct-variogram for elevation was fit with an isotropic model with four nested structures (nugget, Gaussian, spherical, and linear) with ranges between 0 and 270, 000 ft. There was a significant (p = 0. 05, r = 0. 75) linear correlation between TAAP and station elevation. The sample cross-variogram for TAAP and elevation was fit with two nested structures (Gaussian, spherical) with ranges from 55, 000 to 355, 000 ft. Alternate model structures and parameters were compared using cross-validation. Isohyetal maps for average annual precipitation (AAP) were prepared from estimates obtained by kriging and cokriging using the selected models. <b>Isohyets</b> based on the kriging estimates were very smooth, increasing gradually from the southwest to the northeast. <b>Isohyets</b> based on the cokriging estimates and the spatial correlation between AAP and elevation were more irregular and displayed known orographic effects. Indirect confirmation of the cokriging estimates were obtained by comparing <b>isohyets</b> prepared with the cokriging estimates to the boundaries of more densely vegetated and/or forested zones.

The present study aims to generate the primary data to map the rainfall trends {{and its impact on}} groundwater level fluctuation through geomatics techniques. Efforts have been made to evaluate a total of 40 representative rain gauge station samples and analyzed the seasonal rainfall variation over a period of 32 years (1983 - 2014). 50 representative groundwater well samples are collected to study the season-wise groundwater fluctuation of about 14 years (2001 - 2014). Rain gauge stations are plotted on a base map with their respective amount of rainfall, and then the contours of equal rainfall (isohyetes) are drawn using GIS software. The average rainfall between the successive <b>isohyets</b> taken as the average of two isohyetal values is weighed with the area between the <b>isohyets.</b> Climate change and certain human activities threatened directly the groundwater resources globally.

For several decades, this area has been home to rainfed cereal cropping subjecting soils to a strong fragmentation during seedbed preparation, thereby facilitating the degradation of soil by wind erosion. This study was conducted within the agricultural area of Mokrane (Laghouat), a region of the Algerian steppe. In 2009 and 2010, sediment mass flux densities were measured using BSNE sand-traps on a plot of 1. 35 ha cropped with rainfed barley (Hordeum vulgare). A weather station equipped with anemometers, a wind vane and a saltiphone was used to acquire the data needed to characterize erosive events. The results show that in Laghouat sandstorms can last for several days. However, the actual erosive periods were highly variable in terms of duration, ranging from {{a few minutes to}} several hours interspersed with calm periods. Erosive winds originated from the west and north. The average wind speeds during saltation were between 6. 2 and 7. 3 m/s.

In some parts of Western Australia, particularly the ‘wheatbelt’ region which lies between the 600 and 350 mm rainfall <b>isohyets,</b> salinisation, primarily {{as a result of}} land clearing and the associated rise in saline watertables, has been occurring for over a century (Hatton et al. 2003, Figure 1). As a consequence, very few freshwater systems remain in this region, and in order to manage the changing landscape, a key question facing natural resource managers is which physicochemical or ecological thresholds have most importance in the change from saline to hypersaline conditions? Knowing this will allow these systems to be managed so that further losses of ecological function and biodiversity can be prevented. This chapter considers the broad ecosystem changes that occur when salinity rises in waterbodies with salinities ranging from hyposaline to hypersaline (see Box 1). The research question explored in this chapter is ‘do well-defined thresholds exist that signal a change in ecosystem structure and function when moving from saline to hypersaline ecosystems?...|$|R
