25|$|Fans in {{the stands}} began heading for the exits as the game seemed all but over, with no {{apparent}} remaining danger of an Eagles comeback. Nowadays, teams in this situation let the play clock run {{down to the last}} possible second and have the quarterback take a knee. On the sidelines, a disgusted Eagles coach Dick Vermeil was turning his attention away from the field and toward the postgame press conference, where he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> reporters why his team had fallen to an inferior opponent.|$|E
500|$|The wooden {{uprights}} {{between the}} wings of the Wright glider were braced by wires in their own version of Chanute's modified Pratt truss, a bridge-building design he used for his biplane glider (initially built as a triplane). The Wrights mounted the horizontal elevator in front of the wings rather than behind, apparently believing this feature would help to avoid, or protect them, from a nosedive and crash like the one that killed Lilienthal. [...] Wilbur incorrectly believed a tail was not necessary, and their first two gliders did not have one. According to some Wright biographers, Wilbur probably did all the gliding until 1902, perhaps to exercise his authority as older brother and to protect Orville from harm as {{he did not want to}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> Bishop Wright if Orville got injured.|$|E

500|$|In the March 15, 2003 {{episode of}} Saturday Night Live, Tina Fey {{reported}} {{this on the}} satirical Weekend Update: [...] "In a related story, in France, American cheese is now referred to as 'idiot cheese'." [...] The 2006 documentary Freedom Fries: And Other Stupidity We'll <b>Have</b> <b>to</b> <b>Explain</b> <b>to</b> Our Grandchildren directed by Carl Christman took a comedic viewpoint on American consumerism and patriotism. In the episode [...] "Stan Knows Best" [...] of American Dad!, after being asked how his French toast is, the main character Stan remarks: [...] "Smelly and ungrateful! But this American toast is delicious." [...] In the comic strip Doonesbury, the characters Mark Slackmeyer and Zonker Harris criticized the name change in French. Slackmeyer said that, translated, the U.S. liberated France in World War II; and that many French newspaper headlines after 9/11 were [...] "We are all American". At the end, he states that the anti-French were [...] "jingoistic, self-regarding conquer-monkeys!" [...] The French American indie band Freedom Fry chose their name based on the Freedom Fries phenomenon. In 2005, Robert Plant and his band Strange Sensation released the album Mighty ReArranger, which contains the track '"Freedom Fries", an anti-war song whose lyrics contains the words [...] "Freedom fries and burns and scars, the liberator goes too far".|$|E
500|$|Other {{stories were}} {{developed}} from simple concepts. For example, the reformed-vampire episode [...] "Bloodlust" [...] {{was developed to}} suggest that all monsters should not be killed indiscriminately. The plot alluded to [...] "racial issues", but not blatantly; rather, as Padalecki noted, they explored it in a [...] "fun way". The episode [...] "The Usual Suspects" [...] emerged from the writers' desire to keep the audience guessing. Cathryn Humphris pitched a story with a ghost serving as a death omen—warning people of future tragedy, {{rather than trying to}} kill them, unlike previous ghosts on the series. However, Humphris had trouble developing the script's outline. Kripke noted a part of the episode in which brothers are arrested and <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> police what had happened; this scenario ultimately became the framework of the episode, which begins with Sam and Dean being taken into custody. The concept for [...] "Tall Tales" [...] originated as a [...] "he said, he said" [...] episode, in which the brothers would recount conflicting versions of the same storyline. The writers deliberated over the use of five or six monsters in trying to find one appropriate for the episode, but eventually settled on a trickster because it [...] "can do everything [...] want it to". Although the writers typically prefer to put their own spin on folklore, they decided in this case to remain faithful to the archetypal trickster mythos. Because the season alluded to the possibility of Sam becoming bad, the writers wanted to portray how an evil Sam would behave and what Dean's reaction would be. One of the writers' first creative ideas of the season was depicted in the teaser of [...] "Born Under a Bad Sign", in which a blood-covered Sam wakes up not remembering the past week of his life. The plot, which [...] "fell into place" [...] during the writing process, included demonic possession to explain Sam's actions—an event that resulted in the return of the vengeful Meg Masters demon.|$|E
2500|$|You're in such {{a strong}} {{position}} when you understand the scientific process because all you say is, [...] "Do you understand that the great breakthrough of humanity was {{figuring out how to}} make decisions about things whilst discarding human foibles? So, anecdotal evidence involves all your subjectivity—if we do it like this we don't have that anymore. Why, surely do you understand how powerful that is?" [...] And if they don't, then that's what you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> them. It's an extremely powerful thing and a very basic thing.|$|E
5000|$|The song is sung {{from the}} point of view of a husband who <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> his wife why he stayed out until 4:30 in the morning. The tag line in the lyric is: ...|$|R
5000|$|T'Chaka is {{alluded to}} in the Avengers Assemble episode [...] "Panther's Rage." [...] Outside {{of the fact that}} T'Chaka is dead, Captain America <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> T'Challa that his father gave Howard Stark the Vibranium needed to make Captain America's shield.|$|R
5000|$|Cocky Hunter McKay {{lies about}} his age and finds himself in an uncomfortable {{situation}} for a photo shoot for a safe sex campaign. This ambition finally gets the better of him and he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> his parents what he has done.|$|R
2500|$|During an April 11, 2010, {{appearance}} on CNN, host Candy Crowley {{asked if it}} had been insensitive for Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell to omit mentioning slavery in a proposed recognition of Confederate History Month. Barbour replied, [...] "To me, it's a sort of feeling that it's a nit, that it is not significant, that it's not a—it's trying to make {{a big deal out of}} something doesn't amount to diddly." [...] Barbour continued, [...] "I don't know what you would say about slavery ... but anybody that thinks that you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> people that slavery is a bad thing, I think that goes without saying." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} draft of the script, Rubin had not wanted to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> the {{audience}} how Phil got in the loop, and so had the movie start in medias res, with Phil already {{in the midst of the}} looping; the audience would have followed one of his days after waking up to [...] "I Got You Babe" [...] where he is already aware of what will be happening, and thus provoking curiosity to the audience; the film would then have used voice-over narration by Phil to provide some of the backstory. Rita also would confess to being trapped in a time loop of her own. Rubin considered this draft more in line with the black comedy Kind Hearts and Coronets, particularly on how Phil's suicides were presented.|$|E
2500|$|Rousey {{appeared}} nude on {{the cover}} of ESPN The Magazines 2012 Body Issue and in a pictorial therein. Touching upon the strategic cropping, poses, and arm placement used in the photos to make them less revealing, Rousey explained: [...] "With all these ring girls and their vaginas – all of this goes back to advice my mom gave me. She gave me this one piece of advice, which I still hold dear. She said, 'Look, whatever pictures you put out there are gonna be out there forever, so just think that one day your 12 or 13-year-old son or daughter is going to see those pictures. Whatever you want your son or daughter, or even your 13-year-old little sister to see, keep that in mind.' So, whatever I’m not gonna show on a beach, I'm not gonna show in a magazine. These girls are going to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> their kids one day why mommy's ass and vagina are all over the place." [...] Her rival Miesha Tate criticized Rousey's comments as [...] "hypocritical", arguing that Rousey's comments about ring girls constituted a double standard.|$|E
5000|$|In another {{vignette}} a foremen {{gets into}} an argument about a woman not wearing a protective hat, and it is shown that he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> her why the protective cap was necessary. Finally, there are four basic rules to supervising women workers: ...|$|R
5000|$|The studio {{audience}} was generally filled with pensioners who often had difficulty understanding Wood’s refined humour. Before one sketch, the warm up man <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> them what a boutique was. Wood said she heard one disgusted audience member {{say to her}} friend: [...] "You realise we’re missing Brideshead for this".|$|R
50|$|He {{accompanied}} Kennedy to conferences {{with other}} world leaders, including the 1961 meeting with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna. When {{an aid to}} Khrushchev invited Salinger to Moscow, the president assented to his going. Kennedy, however, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> the press corp why he was sending a young and inexperienced Salinger to the Soviet Union.|$|R
60|$|At midnight, as Paul and he blundered {{to their}} cottage over the pungent wet grass, and pine-roots {{confusing}} in the darkness, Babbitt rejoiced {{that he did}} not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> his wife where he had been all evening.|$|E
60|$|He {{came back}} to Chitterlow. He would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> Chitterlow he was taking too much for granted, {{he would have to}} do that. It was so {{difficult}} to do in Chitterlow's presence though; in his absence it was easy enough. This half share, and taking a theatre and all of it, was going too far.|$|E
60|$|HILLMAN. We don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> you why we {{want the}} union,--it's the only way we'll ever get a say about the {{conditions}} in which we work and live, now that the day of individual bargaining is gone by. You understand. Mr. Pindar raised our wages when we threatened to strike last fall, but he calculates to drop 'em again when the soldiers come home.|$|E
5000|$|The {{song was}} {{inspired}} by Atkins' son, Elijah. After having found out that Elijah had been singing Atkins' 2006 hit [...] "If You're Going Through Hell (Before the Devil Even Knows)" [...] to his teachers, he then <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> his son that it [...] "might not be appropriate {{for him to be}} singing that in school".|$|R
60|$|They went on {{like that}} all the evening, and every time the shop-bell went and the widow <b>'ad</b> <b>to</b> go out to serve a {{customer}} they said in w'ispers wot they thought of each other; and once {{when she came back}} rather sudden Ginger <b>'ad</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> 'er that 'e was showing Peter Russet a scratch on his knuckle.|$|R
5000|$|... '"Who says I'm dumb?"' Sergeant O'Rourke has a {{plan that}} he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> Agarn by pulling {{information}} out of Agarn. O'Rourke usually says [...] "I don't know why people say you're dumb," [...] Agarn usually seems pleased that he has contributed. This {{is followed by a}} scene change which inevitably has the realization and belatedly says, [...] "Who says I'm dumb?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Bridge, [...] "I guess, Giova, {{that you}} {{and we are in}} the same boat. We haven't any of us done {{anything}} so very bad but it would be embarrassing to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> the police what we have done," [...] here he glanced at The Oskaloosa Kid and the girl standing beside the youth. [...] "Suppose we form a defensive alliance, eh? We'll help you and you help us. What do you say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{must have}} been eating MOUSE! [...] . No wonder I feel ill. [...] . But perhaps I should feel worse if I had really {{swallowed}} a patty-pan!" [...] Duchess reflected--"What a very awkward thing to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> Ribby! I think I will put MY pie in the back-yard and say nothing about it. When I go home, I will run round and take it away." [...] She put it outside the back-door, and sat down again by the fire, and shut her eyes; when Ribby arrived with the doctor, she seemed fast asleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{one reason}} is {{precisely}} that no particular inconvenience has hitherto been supposed to attach to me. I'm just what I am," [...] said Mamie Cutter; [...] "nothing less and nothing more. It's awkward to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> you, which moreover I really needn't in the least. I'm clever and amusing and charming." [...] She was uneasy and even frightened, but she kept her temper and met him with a grace of her own. [...] "I don't {{think you ought to}} ask me more questions than I ask you." ...|$|E
60|$|Of course I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> {{them that}} I was merely an investigator, a social student, seeking {{to find out}} how the other half lived. And at once they shut up like clams. I was not of their kind; my speech had changed, the tones of my voice were different, in short, I was a superior, and they were superbly class conscious.|$|R
60|$|Then Jessie {{observed}} {{that she had}} not thought such things happened in these days, and Miss Manners <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> her how the possession then permitted was here treated as an allegory to all times, of the evil once cast off returning again if not resolutely excluded by prayer and a strong purpose blessed by the grace of God.|$|R

6000|$|... "Jaqui went to Rome and to Naples, {{wandering}} {{about in}} an objectless sort of way. He dreaded {{to go to}} Milan, because he had not heard that Dr. Paltravi was dead, {{and it would have}} been very hard for him to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> the sick man why he had decided not to carry out his wishes. Apart from the disappointment he would feel when he heard that Donna Paltravi was not to have the kind guardianship he had planned for her, the old doctor would be grieved to the soul when he heard his wife had lost the youth he had taken from her, but which he had expected to return in full measure. What made it worse for Jaqui was that he could administer no comfort with the news. He could not sacrifice himself to please the old man; promise or no promise, this was impossible. He had not consented to marry an old lady. Again, from the very bottom of his heart, did Jaqui wish there never had been a lady in a box.|$|E
