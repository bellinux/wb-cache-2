5|$|Schuur {{first learned}} {{to play the piano}} by ear. Though she later learned to read braille-written music, she found its use {{frustrating}} and impractical since it took away use of one of her hands while playing the piano; however, she frequently used braille-transcribed lyrics in performances and during recording sessions. One of her first public performances was at age ten, singing country music at Tacoma's Holiday Inn; a booking arranged by her aunt. Even when she was a student at the Washington School for the Blind, she would come home on weekends, perform on <b>Friday</b> <b>and</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>nights</b> and take a train back to school for Monday classes.|$|E
