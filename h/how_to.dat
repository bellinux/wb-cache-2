5|$|This was {{followed}} in 1936 by <b>How</b> <b>to</b> be a Detective. The early success of <b>How</b> <b>to</b> Sleep prompted MGM to rush two more short films featuring Benchley, <b>How</b> <b>to</b> Train a Dog, a spoof of dog-training techniques, and <b>How</b> <b>to</b> Behave, which lampooned etiquette norms. <b>How</b> <b>to</b> Sleep was named Best Short Subject at the 1935 Academy Awards, {{while the latter}} two shorts were not as well received.|$|E
5|$|A {{major change}} in the {{training}} programme occurred in 1943. From that point on training concentrated more on the assault infantry role and less on raiding operations. Training now included <b>how</b> <b>to</b> call for fire support from artillery and naval gunfire, and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> obtain tactical air support from the Allied air forces. More emphasis was put on joint training, with two or more Commando units working together in brigades.|$|E
5|$|As Strike Back is a {{military}} drama, the production crew used a vast catalogue of firearms, including side arms, assault and sniper rifles, as well as rocket-propelled grenades, hand grenades and other explosives. Cast members were first taught by carrying weights that mimicked {{the weight of the}} weapons so they could get used to carrying it during filming. Later, they were taught <b>how</b> <b>to</b> carry them professionally, including <b>how</b> <b>to</b> disassemble and re-assemble them, as well as <b>how</b> <b>to</b> fire and reload. Though the majority were actually rubber, duplicates were sometimes used for some of the background characters. Three ex-SAS soldiers gave the cast weapons and tactical training, and were also on hand to oversee how cast members carried the weapons during filming sessions.|$|E

5|$|Benchley {{returned}} to the cinema in 1937, cast in the revue Broadway Melody of 1938, and in his largest role to that point, the critically panned Live, Love and Learn. A short that Benchley completed for MGM, A Night at the Movies, was Benchley's greatest success since <b>How</b> <b>to</b> Sleep, and won him a contract for more short films that would be produced in New York. These films were produced more quickly than his previous efforts (while <b>How</b> <b>to</b> Sleep needed two days, the later short <b>How</b> <b>to</b> Vote needed less than twelve hours), and took their toll on Benchley. He still completed two shoots in one day (one of which was The Courtship of the Newt), but rested for a while following the 1937 schedule.|$|E

5|$|Holmes {{had served}} under Kit Carson and John C. Fremont, {{but he was}} old and {{physically}} impaired when he met Burnham. He had lost all of his family in the Indian wars and before he died he wanted to impart {{his knowledge of the}} frontier to the young Burnham. The two men traveled throughout the American Southwest and northern Mexico, and Holmes taught him many scouting skills, such as <b>how</b> <b>to</b> track a trail, <b>how</b> <b>to</b> double and cover one's own trail, <b>how</b> <b>to</b> properly ascend and descend precipices, and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> tell the time at night. Burnham also learned survival skills from Holmes, such as where to find water in the desert, <b>how</b> <b>to</b> protect himself from snakes, and what to do in case of forest fires or floods. A stickler for details, Holmes impressed on him that even in the simplest things, such as braiding a rope, tying a knot, or putting on or taking off a saddle, there is a right way and a wrong way. The two men earned a living by hunting and prospecting. Burnham also worked as a cowboy, a guard for the mines, a guide, and a scout during these years.|$|E
