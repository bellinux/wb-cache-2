He became an {{enormously}} powerful horse and Marko's inseparable companion. Macedonian legend has it that Marko, following a vilas advice, captured a sick horse on a mountain and cured him.

He {{got off to a}} bad start at the club and asked to return to Old Trafford after being abused by Antwerp {{supporters}} outside the Bosuilstadion, and had to be talked into staying by manager Regi Van Acker. Following this start the club then won 15 matches in a row and Higginbotham become popular with the fans. However, the season ended with defeat in a play-off game, and after the final whistle there was an alleged attack on referee Amand Ancion by teammate Ronnie Wallwork. Higginbotham was subsequently banned from football for a year for his involvement. In September 1999, a Belgian court reduced Higginbotham's ban to four months.
