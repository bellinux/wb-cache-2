5|$|As {{discussed}} above, in the PostgreSQL {{implementation of}} SQL, Null {{is used to}} represent all UNKNOWN results, including the UNKNOWN BOOLEAN. PostgreSQL does not implement the UNKNOWN literal (although it does implement the IS UNKNOWN operator, which is an orthogonal feature.) Most other major vendors <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> Boolean type (as defined in T031) as of 2012. The procedural part of Oracle's PL/SQL supports BOOLEAN however variables; these can also be assigned NULL and the value is considered the same as UNKNOWN.|$|E
5|$|Czech mycologist Josef Šutara {{circumscribed}} {{the genus}} Mariaella in 1987, assigning Mariaella bovina as the type species. Mariaella contained Suillus species in section Fungosi. Molecular studies <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> existence of Mariaella, {{and so it}} is considered synonymous with Suillus. Older synonyms for S.bovinus include those resulting from generic transfers to Agaricus by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in 1783, and the now-obsolete Ixocomus by Lucien Quélet in 1888.|$|E
5|$|One point {{still at}} issue is the {{position}} of Ch'olan and Q'anjobalan–Chujean. Some scholars think these form a separate Western branch (as in the diagram below). Other linguists <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> positing of an especially close relationship between Ch'olan and Q'anjobalan–Chujean; consequently they classify these as two distinct branches emanating directly from the proto-language. An alternative proposed classification groups the Huastecan branch as springing from the Ch'olan-Tzeltalan node, {{rather than as an}} outlying branch springing directly from the proto-Mayan node.|$|E

5|$|Thus, Henry's veneration as a saint and his {{relation}} to King Eric {{seem to have}} emerged in the historical record {{at the same time}} in the mid-1290s with strong support from the church. This correlates with the start of the war against Novgorod. Sources <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> popular assumption, that Henry's cult had developed in Nousiainen and gradually spread among ordinary people before official adoption. Although Nousiainen had Henry as its patronus, that is first mentioned only in 1452. Still in 1232, the church in Nousiainen was consecrated to the Virgin Mary only.|$|E
5|$|In 1802, {{shortly after}} {{discovering}} Pallas, Olbers suggested to Herschel that Ceres and Pallas were fragments {{of a much}} larger planet that once occupied the Mars–Jupiter region, this planet having suffered an internal explosion or a cometary impact many million years before. Over time, however, this hypothesis has fallen from favor. The large amount of energy required to destroy a planet, combined with the belt's low combined mass, which is only about 4% of the mass of the Moon, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> hypothesis. Further, the significant chemical differences between the asteroids become difficult to explain if they come from the same planet. Today, most scientists accept that, rather than fragmenting from a progenitor planet, the asteroids never formed a planet at all.|$|E
5|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that the comets C/1843 D1, C/1880 C1, C/1882 R1, C/1887 B1, C/1963 R1, C/1965 S1, and C/1970 K1 are all members of a family known as the Kreutz Sungrazers, which are all descended from one comet. Current models <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> frequent supposition in the prior literature that the famous comet of 372 BC {{is in fact the}} ultimate parent of the Sungrazers. The comet of 372 BC is often associated with Aristotle who, along with others from his time, described that comet in his writings. However, Aristotle was only twelve {{at the time of the}} comet's appearance and the historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, who also wrote about it was born ten years after its appearance. Consequently, their reports should not be taken as eye-witness accounts. Further, there is no mention of the comet in Chinese literature of the time. Instead either the comet of February 423 or of February 467 with orbital periods of around 700 years is now considered the likely progenitor of the Sungrazers. The fragments of the Great Comet of 1882 will return in several hundred years' time, spread out over perhaps two or three centuries.|$|E

However addictive drugs or exposure to gambling will not lead to addictive behaviors or drug dependence in most individuals but only in vulnerable ones, although, according to some researchers, neuroadaptation or regulation of neuronal plasticity, and molecular changes, may alter gene expression in some cases and subsequently lead to substance use disorders.|$|E
25|$|Other safety {{concerns}} about vaccines {{have been published}} on the Internet, in informal meetings, in books, and at symposia. These include hypotheses that vaccination can cause sudden infant death syndrome, epileptic seizures, allergies, multiple sclerosis, and autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, as well as hypotheses that vaccinations can transmit bovine spongiform encephalopathy, hepatitis C virus, and HIV. These hypotheses have been investigated, with the conclusion that currently used vaccines meet high safety standards and that criticism of vaccine safety in the popular press is not justified. Large well-controlled epidemiologic {{studies have been conducted}} and the results <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> hypothesis that vaccines cause chronic diseases.

25|$|Although {{antiretroviral}} {{therapy has}} helped {{to improve the quality}} of life of people living with HIV, there is still a need to explore other ways to further address the disease burden. One such potential strategy that was investigated was to add interleukin 2 as an adjunct to antiretroviral therapy for adults with HIV. A Cochrane review included 25 randomized controlled trials that were conducted across six countries. The researchers found that interleukin 2 increases the CD4 immune cells, but does not make a difference in terms of death and incidence of other infections. Furthermore, there is probably an increase in side-effects with interleukin 2. The findings of this review <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> use of interleukin 2 as an add-on treatment to antiretroviral therapy for adults with HIV.|$|E
