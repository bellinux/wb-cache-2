Advances in {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) allow unsteady simulations of the flow around realistic telescope geometry, in order to compute the unsteady forces due to wind turbulence. These simulations can then be used to understand {{the characteristics of the}} wind loads. Previous estimates used a parametric model based on a number of assumptions about the wind characteristics, such as a von Karman spectrum and frozen-flow turbulence across M 1, and relied on CFD only to estimate parameters such as mean wind speed and turbulent kinetic energy. Using the CFD-computed forces avoids the need for assumptions regarding the flow.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{investigate}} {{the use of}} adaptive optical devices in three different areas of vision science. These areas are defocus perception, retinal imaging and severe vision loss. Birefringent material has been utilised to produce optical components that can control the angle of refraction of incident light. Using a ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) the orientation of linear polarised light can be controlled. This provides us {{with the ability to}} switch between the two refractive indices of birefringent materials at very high speeds. A focus switchable lens (FSL) has been made from barium borate (BBO), and a ferroelectric liquid crystal to switch between equal and opposite defocus levels to determine the optimum focus correction by making use of the human eye's sensitivity to flicker. Flicker simulation result indicate that there is a high dependence of flicker sensitivity to the flicker frequency. High spatial frequencies also increased the ability to perceive small defocus shifts. Promising results have been obtained showing a person is able to find a point of equal defocus using flicker more accurately than {{they would be able to}} find perfect focus. The same focus switching lens system has the ability to produce fast focus switching cameras. Its potential has been analysed for the use in retinal cameras to ease the process of obtaining good quality images of the optic nerve and providing such cameras with the ability to switch focus within the depth of the optic nerve head at high speeds. Simulation results showed that two FSLs positioned within the zoom system of the imaging arm are able to create focal point shifts of very small amounts.

The traditional profile model does not take advantage of the expected high degree of correlation between adjacent profiles along the boundary. My new multiscale image match model uses a profile scale space, which blurs along the boundary but not across the boundary.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a {{reliable}} information hiding {{scheme based on}} support vector machine and error correcting codes is proposed. To extract the hidden information bits from a possibly tam-pered watermarked image with a lower error probability, information hiding is modeled as a digital communication problem, and both the good generalization ability of support vector machine and the error correction code BCH are applied. Due to the good learning ability of support vector ma-chine, it can learn {{the relationship between the}} hidden information and corresponding watermarked image; when the watermarked image is attacked by some intentional or unintentional attacks, the trained support vector machine can recover the right hidden information bits. The reliability of the proposed scheme has been tested under different attacks. The experimental results show that the embedded information bits are perceptually transparent and can successfully resist common <b>image</b> processing, <b>jitter</b> attack, and geometrical distortions. When the host image is heavily dis-torted, the hidden information can also be extracted recognizably, while most of existing methods are defeated. We expect this approach provide an alternative way for reliable information hiding by applying machine learning technologies.

Since speckle masks the resolution of details in the noisy image and effectively destroys the object structure within the image, it is seen that image reconstruction using bispectrum estimation results in images that regain their object structure.

The science objectives of UVIT are broad, extending from individual hot stars, star-forming regions to active galactic nuclei. Imaging performance of UVIT would depend on several factors in addition to the optics, e. g. resolution of the detectors, Satellite Drift and <b>Jitter,</b> <b>image</b> frame acquisition rate, sky background, source intensity etc. The use of intensified CMOS-imager based photon counting detectors in UVIT put their own complexity over reconstruction of the images.

A study has been done through numerical simulations with artificial point sources and archival image of a galaxy from GALEX data archive, to explore the effects of all the above mentioned parameters on the reconstructed images. In particular the issues of angular resolution, photometric accuracy and photometric-nonlinearity associated with the intensified CMOS-imager based photon counting detectors have been investigated. The photon events in image frames are detected by three different centroid algorithms with some energy thresholds. Our results show that in presence of bright sources, reconstructed images from UVIT would suffer from photometric distortion in a complex way and the presence of overlapping photon events could lead to complex patterns near the bright sources. Further the angular resolution, photometric accuracy and distortion would depend on the values of various thresholds chosen to detect photon events.

To ensure that that the total optical performance degradation due to vibration is less than the corresponding optical error budget allocation, a vibration budget has been created that specifies allowable force levels from each source of vibration in the observatory (e. g., pumps, chillers, cryocoolers, etc.). In addition to its primary purpose, the vibration budget allows us to make design trade-offs, specify isolation requirements for equipment, and tighten or widen individual equipment vibration specifications as necessary. Defining this budget relies on two types of information: (i) vibration transmission analysis that determines the optical consequences that result from forces applied at different locations in the Observatory and at different frequencies; and (ii) initial estimates for plausible source amplitudes in order to allocate force budgets to different sources in the most realistic and cost-effective manner. The transmission of vibration from sources through to their optical consequences uses the finite element model of the telescope structure, including primary mirror segment models and control loops.

The orbit of the Solar Orbiter spacecraft will reach a solar latitude of up to 21 deg (up to 34 deg {{by the end of}} the extended mission) and thus will enable the first local helioseismology studies of the polar regions. Here we consider an array of science objectives to be addressed by helioseismology within the baseline telemetry allocation (51 Gbit per orbit, current baseline) and within the science observing windows (baseline 3 x 10 days per orbit). A particularly important objective is the measurement of large-scale flows at high latitudes (rotation and meridional flow), which are largely unknown but play an important role in flux transport dynamos. The full range of Earth-Sun-spacecraft angles provided by the orbit will enable helioseismology from two vantage points by combining PHI with another instrument: stereoscopic helioseismology will allow the study of the deep solar interior and a better understanding of the physics of solar oscillations in both quiet Sun and sunspots. We have used a model of the PHI instrument to study its performance for helioseismology applications. As input we used a 6 hr time-series of realistic solar magneto-convection simulation (Stagger code) and the SPINOR radiative transfer code to synthesize the observables. The simulated power spectra of solar oscillations show that the instrument is suitable for helioseismology.

In a volumetric 3 D display, viewers can watch the displayed 3 D images from a completely 360 view without using any special eyewear. The volumetric 3 D display techniques may lead to a quantum leap in information display technology and can dramatically change the ways humans interact with computers, which can lead to significant improvements in the efficiency of learning and knowledge management processes. Within a block of glass, a large amount of tiny dots of voxels are created by using a recently available machining technique called laser subsurface engraving (LSE). The LSE is able to produce tiny physical crack points (as small as 0. 05 mm in diameter) at any (x,y,z) location within the cube of transparent material. The crack dots, when illuminated by a light source, scatter the light around and form visible voxels within the 3 D volume. The locations of these tiny voxels are strategically determined such that each can be illuminated by a light ray from a high-resolution digital mirror device (DMD) light engine.

Throughout the electronic image stabilization system, motion vector estimation requires a very large amount of calculation, consumes large amounts of computing resources, and almost occupies most of the computational time of the whole electronic image stabilization system. Thus improving the computing efficiency of motion vector estimation is the key to real-time electronic image stabilization system. Firstly, in this paper，an intensive study is made on rail surface defects detection based on structure light vision, a fast algorithm of structure light center extraction [...] the improved algorithm of Steger algorithm, is put forward and its parallel algorithm is realized in GPU. For the calculation of the depth and width of the rail surface defects, a calculation method based on morphology is put forward in this paper. Under the static condition, the experiment of rail surface defects detection is made, and the result shows that GPU has a very good effect in extracting structured light center. At the same time, this paper studies motion vector estimation algorithm, with block matching algorithm and its improved algorithm the key research object. As an improved algorithm, GEA algorithm (Global Elimination Algorithm) is paralleled processed and is implemented using GPU. Aerial video with translation and small jitter is used in the experiment, and the result shows that GPU has very good speedup for motion vector estimation, and can meet the real-time processing of motion vector estimation...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into two parts: an {{instrumentation}} part and an astrophysical part. The instrumentation part describes {{the development and implementation of}} the fiber coupler and guiding subsystems of the 2 nd generation VLTI instrument GRAVITY. The astrophysical part describes the derivation of the star formation history of the Milky Way’s nuclear star cluster based on imaging and spectroscopic data obtained at the Very Large Telescope. The future VLTI instrument GRAVITY will deliver micro-arcsecond astrometry, using the interferometric combination of four telescopes. The instrument is a joint project of several European institutes lead by the Max Planck Institut f¨ur extraterrestrische Physik. The instrumental part of this thesis describes the fiber coupler unit and the guiding system. They serve for beam stabilization and light injection in GRAVITY. In order to deliver micro-arcsecond astrometry, GRAVITY requires an unprecedented stability of the VLTI optical train. We therefore developed a dedicated guiding system, correcting the longitudinal and lateral pupil wanderas well as the <b>image</b> <b>jitter</b> in VLTI tunnel. The actuators for the correction are provided by four fiber coupler units located in the GRAVITY cryostat. Each fiber coupler picks the light of one telescope and stabilizes the beam. Furthermore each unit provides field de-rotation, polarization adjustment as well as atmospheric piston correction. A novel roof-prism design offers the possibility of on-axis as well as off-axis fringe tracking. Finally the stabilized beam is injected with minimized losses into singlemode fibers via parabolic mirrors. We present lab results of the first guiding- as well as the first fiber coupler prototype, in particular the closed loop performance and the optical quality. Based on the lab results we derive the on-sky performance of the systems and the implications concerning the sensitivity of GRAVITY. The astrophysical part of this thesis presents imaging and integral field spectroscopy data for 450 cool giant stars within 1 pc from Sgr A*. We use the prominent CO bandheads to derive effective temperatures of individual giants. Additionally we present the deepest spectroscopic observation of the Galactic Center so far, probing the number of B 9 /A 0 main sequence stars (2. 2 − 2. 8 M) in two deep fields. From spectro-photometry we construct a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of the red giant population and fit the observed diagram with model populations to derive the star formation history of the nuclear cluster. We find that (1) the average nuclear star-formation rate dropped from an initial maximum 10 Gyrs ago to a deep minimum 1 - 2 Gyrs ago and increased again during the last few hundred Myrs, and (2) that roughly 80...|$|E
40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the {{planetary}} science community {{have recently been}} exploring the potential contributions of stratospheric balloons to {{the planetary}} science field. A study that was recently concluded explored the roughly 200 or so science questions raised in the Planetary Decadal Survey report and found that about 45 of those questions are suited to stratospheric balloon based observations. In September of 2014, a stratospheric balloon mission called BOPPS (which stands for Balloon Observation Platform for Planetary Science) was flown out of Fort Sumner, New Mexico. The mission had two main objectives, first, to observe a number of planetary targets including one or more Oort cloud comets and second, to demonstrate the applicability and performance of the platform, instruments, and subsystems for making scientific measurements in support planetary science objectives. BOPPS carried two science instruments, BIRC and UVVis. BIRC is a cryogenic infrared multispectral imager which can image in the. 6 - 5 m range using an HgCdTe detector. Narrow band filters were used to allow detection of water and CO 2 emission features of the observed targets. The UVVis is an imager with the science range of 300 to 600 nm. A main feature of the UVVis instrument is the incorporation of a guide camera and a Fine Steering Mirror (FSM) system to reduce <b>image</b> <b>jitter</b> to less than 100 milliarcseconds. The BIRC instrument was used to image targets including Oort cloud comets Siding Spring and Jacques, and the dwarf planet 1 Ceres. BOPPS achieved the first ever earth based CO 2 observation of a comet and the first images of water and CO 2 of an Oort cloud comet (Jacques). It also made the first ever measurement of 1 Ceres at 2. 73 m to refine {{the shape of the}} infrared water absorption feature on that body. The UVVis instrument, mounted on its own optics bench, demonstrated the capability for image correction both from atmospheric disturbances {{as well as some of}} the residual motion from the gondola that was not addressed by the gondolas coarse pointing systems. The mission met its primary science and engineering objectives. The results of the BOPPS mission will feed into the body of science knowledge but also feed into future planning for more science from balloon-borne platforms. A notional platform called Gondola for High-Altitude Planetary Science (GHAPS) has been explored and this concept platform can address a number of important decadal questions. This paper provides a summary of the assessment of potential balloon borne observations for planetary science purposes including where potential science contributions can be expected, the necessary performance characteristics of the platform, and other features required or desired. The BOPPS mission is summarized including descriptions of the main elements and key science and engineering results. The paper then briefly describes GHAPS, and the salient features that can make it a valuable tool for future planetary observations...|$|E
