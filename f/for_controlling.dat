40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} time perspective and desire <b>for</b> <b>control</b> in self-reported substance use and to test for a moderating effect of desire <b>for</b> <b>control</b> in the relation between time perspective and substance use. Procedure: A random sample of 240 persons, aged 15 years and over, selected in various public spaces in an urban region in central France. Main outcome measures: Time perspective was measured using subscales of the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI, Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999), Desire <b>for</b> <b>control</b> was measured using a translated version of the Desire <b>for</b> <b>Control</b> Scale (DCS, Burger & Cooper, 1979), and substance use was self-reported. Results: After <b>controlling</b> <b>for</b> age and gender, significant links were found between time perspective and substance use. Desire <b>for</b> <b>control</b> {{did not appear to}} be directly related to substance use. The interaction effect between TP and desire <b>for</b> <b>control</b> appeared to be related to substance use. There was evidence that the relation between TP and substance use is buffered by low desire <b>for</b> <b>control.</b> Conclusion: This study converges with previous studies demonstrating the relation between TP and substance use, but provides evidence of the moderating role played by desire <b>for</b> <b>control.</b> Desire <b>for</b> <b>control</b> thus appears as worthy of interest in the analysis of self-regulatory process, and further research on the links between TP and various aspects of control is required. In order to be more effective, the design of future studies and interventions based on time-related issues should consider how desire <b>for</b> <b>control</b> plays a part in establishing vulnerability profiles...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that defensive pessimists use problem-focused coping in stressful situations. The process of coping with stress by defensive pessimists appears to be affected by the desire <b>for</b> <b>control.</b> Therefore, the effect of the desire <b>for</b> <b>control</b> on defensive pessimism, coping and stress response in controllable and uncontrollable situations was investigated. Japanese undergraduate and graduate students (n = 325) participated in the study. Participants reported past stressful events. And they were classified into eight subgroups: those with, or without the perceived controllability of the events, which cognitive strategy to use, and the degree of desire <b>for</b> <b>control.</b> Results of analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that high desire <b>for</b> <b>control</b> group tended to use problem-focused coping in controllable situation. In uncontrollable situations, defensive pessimists tended to feel stress responses, and especially in low desire <b>for</b> <b>control</b> group, defensive pessimists felt more anxiety than strategic optimists. Additionally, high desire <b>for</b> <b>control</b> group tended to feel anger in uncontrollable situations. These results imply that desire <b>for</b> <b>control</b> effects coping adaptively, and defensive pessimists with low desire <b>for</b> <b>control</b> might not use emotion-focused coping so they feel more anxiety in uncontrollable situations. Although defensive pessimists supposed to have vulnerability to feel stress response easily, they might maintain their health by keeping moderate level of desire <b>for</b> <b>control.</b> The implications and limitations of the present study are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Many {{marketers}} {{and academics}} assume that customers always want {{control of the}} service experience and benefit (perceive value) from having more control (Namasivayam and Mount, 2006). However, empirical support for this assumption is limited. The study proposes that beneficial effects will occur if the opportunity and capacity <b>for</b> <b>control</b> are aligned with desire <b>for</b> <b>control.</b> Conflicting control beliefs –on the other handwill have a detrimental effect. The research question is: (How) does desire <b>for</b> <b>control</b> affect customer attitudes and behavior? To answer the research question, we conducted an experiment in a service context. We developed and produced 8 different video clips in which opportunity, capacity and desire <b>for</b> <b>control</b> were manipulated in a scenario. 379 students participated in the experiment. The results were analyzed with Man(c) ova. The study demonstrates {{that the effect of}} capacity and opportunity <b>for</b> <b>control</b> is not always positive because the effect depends on desire <b>for</b> <b>control.</b> Customers having the desired level of opportunity and capacity <b>for</b> <b>control</b> are most satisfied (with self, the service provider, service process and service outcome); customers having more opportunity and capacity <b>for</b> <b>control</b> than desired are less satisfied and customers having less opportunity and capacity <b>for</b> <b>control</b> than desired are least satisfied. Furthermore, consistency with desire also increases the strength of positive behavioral intentions (like loyalty and positive word of mouth) and conflict with desire increases the strength of negative behavioral intentions (like complaining and switching). The main theoretical conclusion of this study is therefore that more control is not always better: it is better when it is desired, but worse when it is not desired. The managerial implication is that the customer should {{be given the opportunity to}} choose not to exercise control. This study demonstrates that the effect of opportunity and capacity <b>for</b> <b>control</b> in services is conditional and more complex than previously assumed...|$|R

5|$|Bacteria {{used for}} {{biological}} control infect insects via their digestive tracts, so they offer only limited options <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> insects with sucking mouth parts such as aphids and scale insects. Bacillus thuringiensis {{is the most}} widely applied species of bacteria used for biological control, with at least four sub-species used against Lepidopteran (moth, butterfly), Coleopteran (beetle) and Dipteran (true fly) insect pests. The bacterium is available to organic farmers in sachets of dried spores which are mixed with water and sprayed onto vulnerable plants such as brassicas and fruit trees. Genes from B. thuringiensis have also been incorporated into transgenic crops, making the plants express some of the bacterium's toxins, which are proteins. These confer resistance to insect pests and thus reduce the necessity for pesticide use. If pests develop resistance to the toxins in these crops, B. thuringiensis will become useless in organic farming also.|$|E
