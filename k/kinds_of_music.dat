5|$|The American music {{industry}} {{is dominated by}} large companies that produce, market, and distribute certain <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>music.</b> Generally, these companies do not produce, or produce in only very limited quantities, recordings in styles that do not appeal to very large audiences. Smaller companies often fill in the void, offering {{a wide variety of}} recordings in styles ranging from polka to salsa. Many small music industries are built around a core fanbase who may be based largely in one region, such as Tejano or Hawaiian music, or they may be widely dispersed, such as the audience for Jewish klezmer.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of the United States regulates the music industry, enforces intellectual property laws, and promotes and collects certain <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>music.</b> Under American copyright law, musical works, including recordings and compositions, are protected as intellectual property {{as soon as they}} are fixed in a tangible form. Copyright holders often register their work with the Library of Congress, which maintains a collection of the material. In addition, the Library of Congress has actively sought out culturally and musicologically significant materials since the early 20th century, such as by sending researchers to record folk music. These researchers include the pioneering American folk song collector Alan Lomax, whose work helped inspire the roots revival of the mid-20th century. The federal government also funds the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities, which allocate grants to musicians and other artists, the Smithsonian Institution, which conducts research and educational programs, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds non-profit and television broadcasters.|$|E
25|$|I don't {{know why}} {{people call me}} a jazz singer, though I guess people {{associate}} me with jazz because I was raised in it, from way back.

I can't sing a blues – just a right-out blues – but I can put the blues in whatever I sing. I might sing 'Send In the Clowns' and I might stick a little bluesy part in it, or any song.

25|$|Gregorian chant had a {{significant}} impact on the development of medieval and Renaissance music. Modern staff notation developed directly from Gregorian neumes. The square notation that had been devised for plainchant was borrowed and adapted for other <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>music.</b> Certain groupings of neumes were used to indicate repeating rhythms called rhythmic modes. Rounded noteheads increasingly replaced the older squares and lozenges in the 15th and 16th centuries, although chantbooks conservatively maintained the square notation. By the 16th century, the fifth line added to the musical staff had become standard. The bass clef and the flat, natural, and sharp accidentals derived directly from Gregorian notation.|$|E

500|$|The {{underground}} {{punk rock}} movement inspired countless bands that either {{evolved from a}} punk rock sound or brought its outsider spirit to very different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>music.</b> The original punk explosion also had a long-term effect on the music industry, spurring {{the growth of the}} independent sector. During the early 1980s, British bands like New Order and the Cure that straddled the lines of post-punk and new wave developed both new musical styles and a distinctive industrial niche. Though commercially successful over an extended period, they maintained an underground-style, subcultural identity. In the United States, bands such as Hüsker Dü and their Minneapolis protégés the Replacements bridged the gap between punk rock genres like hardcore and the more melodic, explorative realm of what was then called [...] "college rock".|$|E
