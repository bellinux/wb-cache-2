6000|$|As <b>I</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> the Belfry, I {{think with}} a sort of smile of some of my friends in London who are quite sure of how {{children}} will turn out if you give them what they call [...] "the right environment." [...] It is a troublesome thing, environment, for it sometimes works positively and sometimes negatively, and more often between the two. A beautiful environment may make a child love beauty; it may make him bored with beauty; most likely the two effects will mix and neutralise each other. Most likely, that is, the environment will make hardly any difference at all. In the scientific style of history (which was recently fashionable, and is still conventional) we always had a list of countries that had owed their characteristics to their physical conditions.|$|E

Why was he able {{to stand in the}} place of the scarecrow, hidden by nothing but an old hat? Because it was a village policeman who knew the scarecrow was there, was expecting it, and therefore took no notice of it. Now I never expect a scarecrow. I've never seen one in the street, and <b>I</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> one when I see it in the field. It's a new thing to me and worth noticing. And it was just the same when he hid in the well. You are ready to find a well in a place like that; you look for a well, and so you don't see it. I don't look for it, and therefore I do look at it." ...|$|E

I know three witty people all distinct in their excellence--Rice, Reynolds, and Richards. Rice is the wisest, Reynolds the playfullest, Richards the out-o'-the-wayest. The first makes you laugh and think, the second makes you laugh and not think, the third puzzles your head. I admire the first, I enjoy the second, <b>I</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> the third. The first is claret, the second ginger-beer, the third crême de Byrapymdrag. The first is inspired by Minerva, the second by Mercury, the third by Harlequin Epigram, Esq. The first is neat in his dress, the second slovenly, the third uncomfortable. The first speaks adagio, the second allegretto, the third both together. The first is Swiftean, the second Tom-Crib-ean, the third Shandean. And yet these three eans are not three eans but one ean.|$|E

I have deferred answering your note, while I have been scheming and scheming for a day between this time and our departure. But it is all in vain. My engagements have accumulated, and become such a whirl, that no day is left me. Nothing is left me but to get away. I look forward to my release from this dining life with an inexpressible longing after quiet and my own pursuits. What with public speechifying, private eating and drinking, and perpetual simmering in hot rooms, I have made London too hot to hold me and my work together. Mary and Georgina acknowledge the condition of imbecility to which we have become reduced in reference to your kind reminder. They say, when <b>I</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> them in a forlorn way with your note in my hand: [...] "What CAN you do!" [...] To which I can only reply, implicating them: [...] "See what you have brought me to!" ...|$|E
60|$|As I {{stand at}} the street corner, I don't see {{as many as four}} people at once going to church, though I see as many as four churches with their {{steeples}} clamouring for people. I choose my church, and go up the flight of steps to the great entrance in the tower. A mouldy tower within, and like a neglected washhouse. A rope comes through the beamed roof, and a man in the corner pulls it and clashes the bell--a whity-brown man, whose clothes were once black- -a man with flue on him, and cobweb. He stares at me, wondering how I come there, and <b>I</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> him, wondering how he comes there. Through a screen of wood and glass, I peep into the dim church. About twenty people are discernible, waiting to begin. Christening would seem to have faded out of this church long ago, for the font has the dust of desuetude thick upon it, and its wooden cover (shaped like an old-fashioned tureen-cover) looks as if it wouldn't come off, upon requirement. I perceive the altar to be rickety and the Commandments damp. Entering after this survey, I jostle the clergyman in his canonicals, who is entering too from a dark lane behind a pew of state with curtains, where nobody sits. The pew is ornamented with four blue wands, once carried by four somebodys, I suppose, before somebody else, but which there is nobody now to hold or receive honour from. I open the door of a family pew, and shut myself in; if I could occupy twenty family pews at once I might have them. The clerk, a brisk young man (how does HE come here?), glances at me knowingly, as who should say, 'You have done it now; you must stop.' Organ plays. Organ-loft is in a small gallery across the church; gallery congregation, two girls. I wonder within myself what will happen when we are required to sing.|$|E

Once in a while, Mark Cohen will write a poem or give me an idea for a Sunday page, but I do the rest of it. <b>I</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> a blank sheet of paper and come up with it.

5000|$|In {{his later}} years, YYK {{suffered}} from {{many kinds of}} illnesses. He used to be hospitalized {{for months at a}} time; for myocardial infarction (1976), thighbone fracture (1979), heart surgery(1983), hip joint surgery(1984), several strokes and so on. Even though deteriorating health severely limited his activities, YYK remained serene and sharp to the end. Almost defiantly, YYK refused to rest and said in an interview, [...] "Now that I am getting old, I need more enthusiasms and stimuli to continue. When <b>I</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> my paintings, I feel passionate tension, which fills me with some ardor and enthusiasm. I will train myself and paint with this kind of passion and enthusiasm to the end." [...] In his final days, he could work less than few hours a day on a wheelchair. The works created around this time, when he lived in Deungchon-dong and Bangbae-dong, bring the sense of tenderness and comfort because they are painted in pure colors and figures are presented in softer and gentler way more than ever. The screen has been flattened and the basic patterns; such as circles, triangles, and rectangles depicting sky, mountain, Sun, trees, etc. are repeated to deliver joy and delights of life.|$|E

5000|$|Groves has {{mentioned}} on multiple occasions {{that she had}} a very rough childhood. Groves stated [...] "growing up was miserable. i mean-i was a kid. i was alone all the time. i liked to write. that was my thing. i had step dads in and out of my life constantly making promises and then breaking them. i had a brother who made my life a living hell. not even kidding. my whole family was miserable because of him. and its worse than any of you can even imagine." [...] Groves lost her brother Casey Groves on October 23, 2007, at the age of 28 and cites his influence as the reason she was able to gain the courage to be a singer-songwriter. Groves also lost her brother Kelly Groves on March 23, 2014. He was also 28 years old. Groves covered the song Bring Back The Sun by Our Lady Peace on YouTube with the statement:My brother just died. <b>I</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> that sentence and still my brain refuses to process that. My heart may never. My best friend. The only person who would care about the dumb ideas and stories and jokes I had going through my head day by day. He was my biggest fan. He used to buy boxes and boxes of merch off of my website without telling me just to help my dream. Those boxes were all just found in his attic and donated. I never knew. He introduced me to my favorite band and his- Our Lady Peace. When I was 9 he would let me in his room and he'd play shitty covers of our favorite Our Lady Peace song [...] "bring back the sun" [...] on his electric guitar and I would sing. Our lady peace was the song that played at his funeral. The other day I was driving in traffic in LA {{and all of a sudden}} my ipod randomly started playing Our Lady Peace [...] "bring back the sun" [...] and I completely lost it. It was his way of making me finally face the fact that he's gone. I thought I was going to have a heart attack. I got so mad in that moment. Why him? why me? I have quickly realized that without him in my life- it's like the lights got turned off. So this little ROUGH vocal acoustic demo is tying all of that together...MY take on the title [...] "bring back the sun" [...] I love you brother.|$|E

I was lied to. I look at the picture of the smiling face just as Black, if not darker, than mine. His eyes are illuminated with the glare from the camera.

40|$|Candles, {{once the}} most {{reliable}} source for light, are now popular as memorials, religious and romantic decorations, or as symbols of the past. The real candle I made lost its light due {{to the presence of}} the wax—the very source of its light— more specifically, due to the wax’s liquification and liquidity. Its structure creates an irony: its result contradicts the intention that a candle serves as a steady light source. The documentary of the burning process is projected as a moving image onto a part of the candle, which is the original site for the candlelight. To me, the projection presents to viewers the candlelight that you have never seen—a history that was not in your memory. Yet the infinite loop—the eternal return of the ghostly light—can create a fake memory, and therefore, a fake witness. The film does not simply tell you the past, it also reminds you of the past, while the reflection captures everyone coming towards the candle and traps you in the loop. In my college years, I have taken a number of courses and conducted my own research on the Chinese Cultural Revolution, Middle Eastern politics, and the Holocaust. Through hearing stories about all kinds of turmoil and their representations, judgments, and justifications, I began to feel and experience—rather than just seeing—our human history, its complexity, construction, and repetition. I read history; <b>I</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> images; I watch documentaries; I go to museums. At the end of the day, what I perceive forms part of my memory, my history, which becomes an essential element that constructs my identity and myself...|$|E
40|$|Technical: This looped video work {{is made up}} from {{a number}} of still images {{animated}} in a sequence, not intended to be a smooth action, but syncopated. The gaps in real time suggest blinking, lapses in technology, warps in time and distance. The still images have been manipulated in photoshop and imported into an animation software program, showing subtle emphasis on various aspects of the features of the face and location from the screen shots. Content: Obsession {{is one of the most}} constant expressions of love, whether it is a negative attribute, such as stalking, or the need to see or stroke the beloved, or telling and re-telling the story of first meeting. “like the beat, beat, beat of the tom tom when the jungle shadows fall like the tick, tick, tock of the stately clock as it stands against the wall like the drip, drip drip of the rain drops when the summer shower’s through a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you… only you [...] . ” (Cole Porter, Night and Day) My desire to immerse myself in my newly-met adult daughter as a reality is as obsessive as any new parent.

40|$|I make painterly, abstract, ceramic objects. My {{obsession}} with surface and materiality compels me {{to investigate the}} relationship between images and objects through the inherent qualities of ceramic material. Primarily my work communicates directly, through its formal and aesthetic qualities, {{but it may also}} be understood in relationship to abstract painting, minimal work, and process art. I exploit the intrinsic qualities of ceramic material producing works that are warm, seductive, and surprising. Ultimately, my work is a synthesis of intuitive, expressive surfaces and elemental forms. In this body of work there are two main forms: cylinders and curved planes- as well as fragmented versions of both. Since I consider each work as a painting that has form, I limit the complexity of the underlying, structural forms {{in order for them to}} serve as a dimensional, pared down, canvas. The linear edges and basic, stable forms contrast the vibrant activity and complex depth of the surfaces. The cylinders are circular paintings. When viewed in profile the cylindrical object becomes a flattened, rectangular plane. When approached the interior of the vessel is revealed, exposing the dimension of the object and the physical space it consumes. This dual perception creates a conceptual overlap between object and image. I am compelled to paint the insides of my cylinders with slips and glaze in part because it creates an awareness of this dichotomy but also because it creates new compositional viewpoints, and invites prolonged interaction with the viewer. I use form to reiterate the visual and psychological depth of the surface, which emphasizes the power and presence of objects. The curved planes are more closely related to traditional paintings. However, the relatively flat, one-sided planes extend out from the wall in a large mass, activating the surrounding space. Their weight and physical presence underlines the fact that they are objects as well as images. There is physical and visual access to more than one side of the piece. Some of my forms are fragmented or cut, which activates a sense that the piece came from a larger, more expansive form. When there is accidental breakage I respond by capitalizing on it. The decision to further break, cut, and chip pieces provides formal resolution. Fragmentation of the work obscures the viewer’s ability to conclude how the work was made- even to somebody with in depth knowledge of ceramic process. I utilize the fragile and inherent instabilities of ceramic, which are often considered failures, to furthermore demonstrate my understanding of materiality and its conceptual function because I intentionally integrate the failure of the material into aesthetically resolved work. Tactility is deeply important to my entire process. After forming the piece, I lay a ground of white slip over the red earthenware clay. I relinquish conscious control of my mark making in the early stages of layering colored slips and stains. As I paint, often with my fingers, my intuitive decisions stem from a loose, rhythmic, internal spark. Next the work goes through one initial firing before I continue to layer more glazes and pigments. Preparing to apply colors is as much a part of my process as physically carrying out the act. <b>I</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> the work for long periods of time, estimating and envisioning how the surfaces will melt, drip, and transform in the firing in hopes of a successful composition. Lastly, I apply the final layer of glaze, which obscures the surface beyond recognition. The result after the final glaze firing is never in my complete control. It is a combination of what I envisioned and what actually happened. The absence of representation in my work allows the marks, brush strokes and color to communicate. I create energy through formal dualities. Drips, swipes, and splashes of colorful glazes contend with one another for the viewer’s attention. For example, aggressive and passive elements are adjacent to one another. Bold hues intermingle with quiet tints and shades. The surfaces sometimes look weathered and aged, but at the same time colorfully lush and wet. There is a sense of immediacy to the mark making and at moments a sense of play. These completed surfaces look effortless, but in fact they are the result of my deep understanding of the physical and chemical behavior of ceramic materials. My aim is to create work that is scintillating and dramatic. The phenomenon of ceramic surface is always surprising me with new potential that becomes my motivation. I want to engage my viewers with visually striking work, which also contain more subtle layers of meaning. Ultimately, my work is a synthesis of intuitive, expressive surfaces and elemental forms. In a successful work, the intrinsic qualities of the material are transcendent. By using materiality in an unexpected way, I want my viewers to experience something that goes beyond the physical pieces. My aim is to use ceramic surface and form to create a new synergistic whole...|$|E
