5|$|The SSG {{entered the}} complex, which {{also served as}} Abdul Rasid Ghazi's living quarters, and engaged in a firefight in the main courtyard. Militants fired on them from {{makeshift}} bunkers beneath the stairwell. Army spokesman Arshad later stated that the militants must have been fortifying the bunkers for several months. Once the courtyard was cleared, the SSG entered the labyrinth of the Jamia Hafsa building. Militants inside were armed with guns and rockets, and some areas were booby-trapped. Some militants had bullet- and <b>explosion-proof</b> vests and other sophisticated weapons. The SSG suffered most of their casualties during {{this phase of the}} operation. In close-quarter combat, the SSG were attacked with smoke grenades, incendiary grenades, and fragmentation grenades. Twenty-nine of the thirty-three SSG commandos who were injured in the operation received injuries from fragmentation grenades. As the fight continued, the SSG came upon a room in which half a dozen militants were present. One of the militants detonated a suicide jacket, killing everyone in the room.. It took several hours of intense fighting before the SSG gained control of Jamia Hafsa, with only the basement remaining to be secured.|$|E

25|$|In the past, grain {{elevators}} sometimes experienced silo explosions. Fine powder {{from the}} millions of grains passing through the facility would accumulate and mix with the oxygen in the air. A spark could spread from one floating particle to the other creating a chain reaction that would destroy the entire structure. (This dispersed-fuel explosion is the mechanism behind fuel-air bombs.) To prevent this, elevators have very rigorous rules against smoking or any other open flame. Many elevators also have various devices installed to maximize ventilation, safeguards against overheating in belt conveyors, legs, bearing, and <b>explosion-proof</b> electrical devices such as electric motors, switches, and lighting.|$|E
30|$|Intake {{resistance}} {{is an important}} factor affecting engine power. The intake spark arrestor is a key component of the air intake system in <b>explosion-proofing</b> the diesel engine, which directly affects engine performance. Through the experiment, after the installation of the air inlet device on the diesel engine, the losses of power and torque is up to 14  %. To improve the flow characteristics of the diesel engine intake, the original structure had been optimized. With a comparative analysis of eddy current resistance loss at inlet/outlet section in different intake spark arrestors, an inclined windward surface end grid plate was designed to substantially reduce inlet resistance.|$|R
25|$|During the war years, the C-46 {{was noted}} for an {{abnormal}} number of unexplained airborne explosions (31 between May 1943 and May 1945) that were initially attributed to various causes. In particular, the fuel system, which was quickly designed, then modified for the new, thirstier Pratt & Whitney engines, was criticized. The {{cause of the}} explosions was eventually traced to pooled gasoline from small leaks in the tanks and fuel system, combined with a spark, usually originating from open-contact electrical components. Though many service aircraft suffered small fuel leaks in use, the C-46's wings were unvented; if a leak occurred, the gasoline had nowhere to drain, but rather pooled at the wing root. Any spark or fire could set off an explosion. After the war, all C-46 aircraft received a wing vent modification to vent pooled gasoline, and an <b>explosion-proof</b> fuel booster pump was installed with shielded electrical selector switches {{in lieu of the}} open-contact type used originally.|$|E
