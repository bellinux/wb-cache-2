5|$|The strongest {{tropical}} cyclone {{to make landfall}} on the state was the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935, which crossed the Florida Keys with a pressure of 892mbar (hPa; 26.35inHg); {{it is also the}} strongest hurricane on record to strike the United States. Out of the ten most intense landfalling United States hurricanes, four struck <b>Florida</b> <b>at</b> peak strength.|$|E
5|$|A {{moderately}} strong hurricane with {{winds of}} 105mph (165km/h) was first spotted on October 6 east of Jamaica. Passing {{a short distance}} south of the island, the hurricane tracked northwestward and brushed the Yucatán Peninsula before turning north-northeastward into the Gulf of Mexico. Late on October 9, it made landfall a short distance east of Apalachicola, <b>Florida</b> <b>at</b> peak winds with an estimated pressure of 969mbar. Rapidly weakening to tropical storm status, the cyclone continued northeastward and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from North Carolina on October 11. Later that day, it was last observed about 250mi (400km) southeast of Cape Cod.|$|E

5|$|A second {{hurricane}} {{was spotted}} in the Straits of <b>Florida</b> <b>at</b> tropical storm intensity on September10. Several hours later, the system made landfall in Marquesas Keys, Florida. Early on September11, it strengthened into a hurricane. Intensifying slightly further, the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 85mph (140km/h) shortly thereafter. The hurricane maintained this intensity while moving west-northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico and struck extreme southwestern Cameron Parish, Louisiana early on September13. Shortly thereafter, it weakened to {{a tropical storm}} over Texas, before dissipating several hours later.|$|E
5|$|At the storm's initial {{landfall}} {{in southern}} Florida, heavy rains and strong winds caused extensive damage to crops, particularly to avocado and citrus. As the strengthening hurricane {{moved to the}} northwest through the Gulf of Mexico, it generated strong surf that caused severe damage to coastal areas across western <b>Florida.</b> <b>At</b> its second landfall, hurricane force winds were produced across a wide swath of the coast. Agricultural lands in coastal regions of Mississippi and Alabama were damaged by strong winds and heavy rain. The hurricane caused one indirect death and $228,500 in total damages across its path.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} on September21 Harvey {{accelerated}} slightly and turned southeastward. Although {{the center of}} the storm was poorly defined at the time and located to the northwest of the main area of thunderstorm activity, convection was strong in nature. Later that day the storm curved towards the east while approaching <b>Florida.</b> <b>At</b> around 1700UTC on September21 Harvey made landfall near Everglades City, Florida with sustained winds of 60mph (95km/h). The storm further accelerated across the Florida Peninsula and quickly merged with a developing storm off the coast of South Carolina at 0600UTC on September22. Although the remnants of Harvey became unidentifiable later that day, Environment Canada reported that the system crossed Newfoundland before dissipating on September24.|$|E

5|$|The Rosewood {{massacre}} was {{a racially}} motivated massacre {{of black people}} and destruction of a black town that {{took place during the}} first week of January 1923 in rural Levy County, <b>Florida.</b> <b>At</b> least six black people and two white people were killed, though eyewitness accounts suggested a death toll as high as 150. The town of Rosewood was abandoned and destroyed in what contemporary news reports characterized as a race riot. Racial disturbances were common during the early 20th century in the United States, reflecting the nation's rapid social changes. Florida had an especially high number of lynchings of black males in the years before the massacre, including a well-publicized incident in December 1922.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Charley in North Carolina were minor to {{moderate}} and included $25million (2004USD) in damage. Hurricane Charley lasted from August 9 to August 15, 2004, and at peak intensity it attained 150miles per hour (240km/h) winds, {{making it a}} strong Category4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm made landfall in southwestern <b>Florida</b> <b>at</b> maximum strength, and moved northward, parallel to the U.S. East Coast before moving ashore on northeastern South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Charley in South Carolina {{included}} $20million (2004USD) in damage and 135,000power outages.

5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{continued to}} intensify, and attained Category 2 hurricane intensity by 0600 UTC on August 7. At {{around the same}} time, the S.S. Lempira reported a minimum pressure of 971 mbar (hPa; 28.70 inHg), while 30 miles (50 km) southeast of Jupiter, <b>Florida.</b> <b>At</b> the time, maximum sustained winds were estimated at 105 mph (170 km/h); {{this would be the}} hurricane's peak intensity. The hurricane weakened slightly before making landfall on central Florida, just southeast of Fort Pierce, <b>Florida,</b> <b>at</b> 0700 UTC the following day. Winds at landfall were estimated at 100 mph (160 km/h), with a minimum central pressure of 977 mbar (28.85 inHg) recorded in Fort Pierce within the hurricane's eye. At the time, the system's maximum winds extended up to 10 mi (15 km) from the center of circulation. The storm then slowly crossed the Florida peninsula, before entering the Gulf of Mexico the next day near Tampa, Florida, after having weakened down to tropical storm strength. Despite remaining over water, its close proximity to the continent prevented further strengthening. The tropical storm recurved to the north in the gulf, before making a second landfall near Apalachicola, <b>Florida</b> <b>at</b> 0400 UTC on August 10 with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). Moving inland, the system rapidly weakened as it continued to recurve to the northeast, further degenerating to tropical depression strength at 0000 UTC on August 11 while situated over Georgia. Based on weather station observations, the storm was analyzed to have transitioned into an extratropical cyclone later that day. The extratropical storm strengthened slightly over the Mid-Atlantic states, before exiting into the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia Capes. The storm system progressed eastward across the ocean before dissipating at 1800 UTC on August 14.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Irene {{strengthened}} as {{it moved}} northward, and reached maximum sustained winds of 70mph (115km/h) early on October 14. Operationally, Irene was upgraded to a hurricane on October 14, although later analysis after the hurricane season indicated it remained a tropical storm until later. Irene continued to move towards the north-northeast, crossed over the western portion of the Isla de la Juventud as a strong tropical storm, and hours later, it struck mainland Cuba near Batabano. The storm was able to strengthen further over the Florida Straits, and Irene attained hurricane status on October 15. It passed over Key West, turned more to the north-northeast, and struck mainland <b>Florida</b> <b>at</b> Cape Sable as an 80mph (130km/h) hurricane.|$|E

5|$|After {{emerging}} {{into the}} Straits of Florida on September21, the storm resumed intensification, before striking near Boca Chica Key, Florida with winds of 120mph (195km/h). By early on September22, the system peaked as a Category4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 130mph (215km/h). Shortly thereafter, another landfall occurred near Chokoloskee, <b>Florida</b> <b>at</b> the same intensity. Severe damage {{was reported in}} the state due to strong winds. The storm was considered the worst in Key West since the 1919 Florida Keys hurricane. Throughout the state, 1,200homes were severely damaged or destroyed, while 40businesses were demolished and 237suffered impact. Throughout Florida, there were three fatalities and approximately $12million (1948USD) in damage, over half of which was inflicted on crops. The storm rapidly weakened while crossing the state and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean as only a Category1 hurricane later on September22. Slight fluctuations in intensity occurred before the hurricane became extratropical early on September24, while located northwest of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|Due to A. rubrums {{very wide}} range, there is {{significant}} variation in hardiness, size, form, time of flushing, onset of dormancy, and other traits. Generally speaking, individuals from the north flush the earliest, have the most reddish fall color, set their buds the earliest and take the least winter injury. Seedlings are tallest in the north-central and east-central part of the range. In <b>Florida,</b> <b>at</b> the extreme south of the red maple's range, it is limited exclusively to swamplands. The fruits also vary geographically with northern individuals in areas with brief, frost-free periods producing fruits that are shorter and heavier than their southern counterparts. As {{a result of the}} variation there is much genetic potential for breeding programs with a goal of producing red maples for cultivation. This is especially useful for making urban cultivars that require resistance from verticillium wilt, air pollution, and drought.|$|E
5|$|Harper {{noticed that}} Bartram's notes were {{considerably}} altered and expanded in the printed edition, and the {{detail of the}} white tail appeared in print {{for the first time}} in this revised account. Harper believed that Bartram could have tried to fill in details of the bird from memory and got the tail coloration wrong. Harper and several other researchers have attempted to prove the former existence of a king vulture relative in <b>Florida</b> <b>at</b> this late date, suggesting that the population was in the process of extinction and finally disappeared during a cold spell. Additionally, William McAtee, noting the tendency of birds to form Floridian subspecies, suggested that the white tail could be a sign that the painted vulture was a subspecies of the king vulture.|$|E
