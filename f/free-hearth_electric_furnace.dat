40|$|At Tokushima Plant of Nippon Denko Co., Ltd. {{high-carbon}} ferromanganese {{is produced}} by the <b>electric</b> <b>furnace</b> method using lump manganese ores and sintered manganese ores manufactured from fine manganese ores. However, the distribution of manganese ores is significantly uneven on earth, and their characteristics considerably vary by ore type. It is known from experience that the production of high-carbon ferromanganese by the <b>electric</b> <b>furnace</b> method depends greatly on material ores. Therefore, to maintain stable operation in the electric furnace-smelting field, {{it is important to}} identify the characteristics of each type of material ores in advance. Thus, we evaluated the high-temperature electric characteristics of manganese ores using the electrical conductivity measuring system developed by ourselves and provided the standards for determining ores and blending ratio necessary for stable operation of the <b>electric</b> <b>furnace</b> based on the evaluation results. This time we worked for optimisation of the high-temperature electric characteristics of sintered manganese ores through modification of the characteristics because the blending ratio of sintered manganese ores in the <b>electric</b> <b>furnace</b> is high. The electrical conductivity of sintered ores having various chemical components in a high-temperature region (up to 1 550 °C) was measured using our electrical conductivity measuring syste...|$|R
