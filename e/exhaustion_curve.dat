In {{the present}} work, some {{specific}} amino compounds {{were linked to}} the cotton fabrics on a process that can impart {{at the same time}} dyeability and durable antimicrobial properties. The process was monitored on-line in a prototype dyeing system since the addition of cationic agents will influence dye uptake. Different dyeing conditions were tested with direct dyes, with and without salt, until the <b>exhaustion</b> <b>curve</b> was at least equivalent to the standard dyeing curve in the presence of salt...|$|E
40|$|Coal fly ash was {{characterized}} at first in batch adsorption with acid and basic dyes. Good results of removal were obtained, although strongly dependent on initial dye concentration, ash dosage, {{and above all}} on pH of the solution. The maximum adsorption capacities per g of fly ash were 410 mg of Acid Blue 25 and 142 mg of Basic Blue 9, both with an ash dosage of 2 g/L at pH 11 after a contact time of 1 h. However, increasing the ash dosage to 20 g/L and contact time to 24 h, the maximum adsorption capacity of Basic Blue 9 raised 187 mg/g fly ash at pH 11, but this value was lowered to 8. 4 mg/g at pH 7. Afterwards, flow experiments were carried out in semi-batch mode with a fixed amount of ash and continuous flow of dye solution in continuous stirred tank reactor, to determine the <b>exhaustion</b> <b>curves</b> of fly ash. The best fit of the results was obtained by a sigmoidal function referable to the breakthrough curve model of Yoon-Nelson. Successively, to reduce the alkali leaching by solution flow, in a semi-pilot scale plant, a continuous stream of dye solution was mixed in stirred tank reactor with a continuous ash slurry supply, and the resulting slurry was decanted in a settling tank to obtain a clarified supernatant stream outlet. In this last equipment, the optimum conditions were investigated to obtain the highest yields of dye removal from solutions at low concentrations (5 - 20 mg/L) such as those occur in rinsing waters arising from dyeing processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of ultrasounds in dyeing and washing industrial treatments {{is an important}} research theme because, {{as can be seen}} from a literature survey, this technique seems to be able to reduce the environmental impact and costs of these fundamental processes. In the frame of the Regional Project INTEXUSA concerning the intensification of dyeing and washing processes, a preliminary study was carried out with the aim of evaluating the dyeing kinetics improvement by ultrasound (US) application at different operative condition from a {{point of view of the}} process parameters. The tests were carried out in a pilot apparatus in which a significant quantity of fabric can stand (or move) over the ultrasonic transducer with variable power and frequency. The US multi frequency transducer was rectangular, flat with 500 W power and dimensions 400 x 150 x 80 m 3; the wool fabric was tested at different exposure time and dyebath ratio of 1 : 70. Also the influence of the distance of the fabric from the US transducer was examined. During the dyeing experiments, for each trial, the dye-bath <b>exhaustion</b> <b>curves</b> has been determined by using an UV-Vis spectrophotometer and by detecting the other parameters (pH, temperature) with an online diagnostic equipment. For every dyeing isotherm, the apparent activation energy of the dyeing kinetics was calculated. In addition color fastness, artificial light and rubbing tests, which are related to the fabric quality, were measured. The research allowed the definition of the parameters which play have the most relevant role in the dyeing "ultrasonic" proces...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work was to increase the retarding effect of the acid dye Telon Blue RR (C. I. Acid Blue 62) release on polyamide fibres dyeing by encapsulation of the dye in liposomes {{as an alternative to}} synthetic auxiliaries, in order to reduce effluent pollution. The retarding effect achieved with the use of mixed cationic liposomes of dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide (DODAB) /soybean lecithin (containing a 10 % molar fraction of DODAB) was better in comparison with either pure soybean lecithin liposomes or synthetic auxiliaries. The retarding effect of liposomes on the dye release was analysed through changes in the absorption and fluorescence spectra of the acid dye at different conditions. The effect of temperature (in the range of 25 ºC - 70 ºC) on the spectroscopic behaviour of the dye in the absence and in presence of polyamide was also studied, in order to simulate the dyeing conditions. <b>Exhaustion</b> <b>curves</b> obtained in dyeing experiments showed that, below 45 ºC, the retarding effect of the mixed liposomes (lecithin/DODAB (9 : 1)) was {{similar to that of the}} auxiliaries, but better than the one of pure lecithin liposomes. At higher temperatures (above 45 ºC), the system lecithin/DODAB presents a better performance, achieving a higher final exhaustion level when compared with the commercial levelling agent without losing the smoothing effect of lecithin.

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was to improve wool's {{dyeability}} using acid dye through a simple pretreatment with ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Different radiation doses were investigated using both a laboratory UV lamp and a semi-industrial apparatus. UV-treated fabrics were characterized in terms of morphological, chemical and physical properties by SEM, FTIR-ATR spectra, water contact angle measurements, bursting and pilling test. The pre-treated samples were then dyed with an acid dye at different dyeing temperatures to compare the results with the untreated fabric. Final bath <b>exhaustion</b> reached, kinetic <b>curves</b> and colour measurements were evaluated. Moreover, the colour levelness of the dyeings obtained on fabrics with and without irradiation was assessed. Finally, dyeing fastness to washing and rubbing were determined according to ISO standard method...|$|R
40|$|Although {{economists have}} studied various {{indicators}} of resource scarcity (e. g., unit cost, resource rent, and market price), {{the phenomenon of}} “peaking” has largely been ignored due to its connection to non-economic theories of resource <b>exhaustion</b> (the Hubbert <b>Curve).</b> I take a somewhat different view, one that interprets peaking {{as a reflection of}} fundamental economic determinants of an intertemporal equilibrium. From that perspective, it is reasonable to ask whether the occurrence and timing of the peak reveals anything useful regarding the state of resource exhaustion. Accordingly, I examine peaking as an indicator of resource scarcity and compare its performance to the traditional economic indicators. I find the phenomenon of peaking to be an ambiguous indicator, at best. If someone announced that the peak would arrive earlier than expected, and you believed them, you would not know whether the news was good or bad. Unfortunately, the traditional economic indicators fare no better. Their movements are driven partially by long-term trends unrelated to changes in scarcity, and partially but inconsistently driven by actual changes in scarcity. Thus, the traditional indicators provide a signal that is garbled and unreliable. - Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research...|$|R
