5000|$|In 1903, the Waterview surgar mill was {{destroyed}} by floods, and had to cease operations. In addition, the Waterview sawmill, with £300 worth of sawn and <b>dressed</b> <b>timber</b> and £500 worth of logs, {{was destroyed}}. The Bundaberg Foundry also received serious injury.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} is divided {{by a series}} of timber slabs partitions the height of the long, side walls. The plan consists of a central corridor, the walls of which are half-height and made with horizontal slabs. This corridor leads into a room for which the hayloft platform makes a ceiling. The rafters are made of stripped tree trunks, while the battening that does exist is <b>dressed</b> <b>timber.</b>|$|E
50|$|Approximately 65 metres {{long and}} 13 metres wide with a {{truncation}} to the northeast, {{the building is}} organised over three levels - the former joinery workshop at street level, the former pre-cut house fabrication workshop to the middle and the sawmilling area at the lower level. The former joinery complex is notable for the range of timbers used {{in the construction of}} the various parts of the building ranging from sawn and <b>dressed</b> <b>timbers</b> to logs retaining their bark.|$|R
5000|$|A slab hut is {{actually}} a 'slab-walled' structure. Its walls were, strictly speaking, built from 'flitches'. Slabs are sawn from a trunk, flitches are split from it. [...] Hut-builders felled selected trees, and sawed the trunks into suitable lengths. They then split these lengths into flitches using a maul and a wedge. Timber was split , that is, along the grain, instead of by the traditional British [...] method, from {{the core of the}} trunk out towards the bark. There was neither time nor tools suitable to properly <b>dress</b> <b>timber</b> into planks, nor to season the timber; it was used green.|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the early}} work in the area {{involved}} cutting, sawing and <b>dressing</b> <b>timber</b> from Arthurs Seat {{for the construction of}} piers around the bay and at Flinders. Farmers were involved with this livelihood and were carting the wood on Bullock drays to Captain Peter Pidoto's Little Angelina to Sheepwash Creek. Many of the grantees of land around the township were at first tenants on Jamieson's Special Survey. (Sources as above plus Rosebud;Flower of the Peninsula.) Dromana's commercial centre is concentrated on Point Nepean Road, with Arthurs Seat and surrounding bushland providing a scenic backdrop. Across the road is an attractive foreshore with calm, sandy beaches, including designated camping areas. It is also home to the D.A. Christie Public Barbecue, which started manufacture in the Dromana Industrial Estate in 1974. Points of interest along the coast include the Dromana Pier, the rocky cutting at Anthonys Nose and the Mornington Peninsula Visitor Information Centre.|$|R
50|$|The {{semi-circular}} planned chancel with truncated low pitched {{metal clad}} roof adjoins {{the eastern end}} of the nave of the church and is similarly detailed with narrow windows on the north and south elevations. The sub floor area of the altar accommodates a mortuary chamber in which the late Charles Shepherd, benefactor of the church, is entombed. Enclosing the chamber at {{the eastern end of}} the chancel, is a <b>dressed</b> <b>timber</b> panel decorated with a timber cross.|$|E
50|$|The chancel {{contains}} two platforms covered with carpet, {{stepping up to}} the sanctuary and altar. A large opening in {{the eastern end of}} the nave frames the sanctuary beyond and a curved brick wall with centrally suspended curtain creates the backdrop to the sanctuary and altar. Low level, angled brick walls create the altar rail and the elevated pulpit is located in the south-east corner of the chancel behind a curved face brick wall. Both walls are finished with a <b>dressed</b> <b>timber</b> capping. The sanctuary ceiling is lined with Cane-ite and painted light blue.|$|E
50|$|Internally {{the timber}} floors were predominately covered with carpet with the {{exception}} of the amenities areas. This was removed in 2010 and the original hoop-pine timber floors were polished and restored. The walls and ceilings are clad with timber tongue and groove boards and the timber joinery to door and window architraves is well crafted. The entry hall and central room have a timber panelled dado and a <b>dressed</b> <b>timber</b> arch announces the entry from the hall to the central room of the house. Ornate carved timber and tile surround fireplaces are located in one of the main rooms at the entry, the dining room and a secondary room on the eastern side of the house.|$|E

50|$|The {{most popular}} {{industries}} for employment were Log Sawmilling and <b>Timber</b> <b>Dressing</b> (8%), School Education (4.8%) and Retail Trade (3.8%), while {{the unemployment rate}} is approx. 7%. The median weekly household income is A$814 or more per week, compared with $924 in Adelaide.|$|R
50|$|It {{was built}} in 1899, to Arts and Crafts-style designs by Joseph Crouch and Edmund Butler, as a house for Alfred Constantine, a {{manufacturing}} jeweller. At the time, the area was in Staffordshire. The building is made of brick, with stone <b>dressing</b> and applied <b>timber</b> framing. The roof is tiled, with an off-centre cupola.|$|R
50|$|The Sale Yards are {{a series}} of open pavilions with bush-timber posts, {{concrete}} floors, <b>dressed</b> <b>timber</b> roof framing and corrugated iron roofs. The roofs are a mixture of gabled, half-gabled and hipped forms, with fixed timber louvres infilling some of the gables. The yards contain {{a series of}} pens, framed in walls and gates of timber slats, with some of the walls being relocatable to vary the size of the pens. The gates have sliding timber slats used as catches. To the periphery {{are a series of}} uncovered pens and loading ramps for vehicles and the railway. The smaller pavilion to the east of the group contains an auction pit surrounded by timber bench seats. The yards are presently still in use weekly for pig and calf sales.|$|E
50|$|It {{is thought}} that {{the first section of}} the {{homestead}} was constructed in the 1840s. This is the south western wing of the extant complex, and is constructed from vertical adze cut timber slabs housed in <b>dressed</b> <b>timber</b> beams at the base and top of the walls. This building originally had a gabled roof clad with shingles and extending, with a lower pitch, over verandahs at the front and rear. There is little evidence to suggest a building date only that it was probably built within a few years of the arrival of Borthwick on the property. The building is similar in construction technique and age to structures on other early homesteads including the first stage of the Canning Downs principal residence built in about 1847 and also to the first stage of Cressbrook also built in the mid 1840s.|$|E
5000|$|Fruits and {{vegetables}} are advertised, sold and weighed by the kilogram, groceries are packed and labelled in metric measures. Schooling is wholly metric. Newspaper reports are mostly in metric terms. In some cases old imperial standards were replaced with rounded metric values, as with horse racing or the size of beer glasses (rounded to the nearest 5 mL). The pre-metric names of beer glass sizes, including the pint, have been retained (although in South Australia the [...] "pint" [...] of beer is not an imperial pint, as it is elsewhere in Australia). <b>Dressed</b> <b>timber</b> is often sold in lengths such as 1.8, 2.1, 2.4, 3.0 and 3.6 metres, each multiples of 300 mm, thereby approximating foot length increments, while pipes and conduits may be specified as having diameters of 12, 19, 25 and 32 etc. mm (based on [...] "soft" [...] conversions" [...] of , , 1 and [...] in).|$|E

She {{is sitting}} on the ground outside with her back against a small pile of adobe bricks holding a small {{partially}} completed basket on her lap. Another shallow basket in front of her holds some of her basket-making material. A small bowl sits beside it. She wears a long dotted <b>dress.</b> A hewn <b>timber</b> lays beside the pile of bricks. The desert is visible in the background...|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  3, squared-off <b>timbers</b> (<b>dressed</b> on three sides) are placed {{upstream}} and downstream of the dam body with no gaps between them as walling materials to prevent the filling material being washed away. These dams are also constructed so that extra walling material can be added on the downstream side, {{to take account of}} the fact that the filling material may be washed away as a result of future rotting of the walling material due to biodegradation.|$|R
50|$|On the {{northern}} {{side of the}} Warrego Highway, the Sewerage Treatment Works and the nearby Pump House on Lockyer Creek are important in illustrating the principal characteristics of early 1940s facilities of this type, and important historically for their association {{with the presence of}} an American military hospital at the College during the Second World War. The <b>timber</b> <b>Dressing</b> Shed beside Lockyer Creek at the northwest end of the campus is a rare known surviving example of this type of recreational structure.|$|R
5000|$|Red River Frame was {{a popular}} name for the post-and-plank {{construction}} technique used in the Red River Colony in the 19th Century. The building style was characterized by a <b>dressed</b> <b>timber</b> structure with a horizontal log infill. The spaces between the logs were filled or 'chinked' with clay and straw. The exterior would either be whitewashed with a limestone/water plaster mixture, or in later years, the exterior would be covered by board siding. This style was popular because it could use smaller trees for logs [...] - [...] the longest trees needed were for the vertical logs. The Farm Manager's House at Lower Fort Garry, the William Brown House at the Historical Museum of St James - Assiniboia, the historical Fur Warehouse at Fort St. James National Historic Site of Canada and Riel House in Winnipeg, Manitoba are excellent examples of Red River Frame construction.|$|E
50|$|The lock {{hospital}} cemetery {{is located}} 80 m south-west of the lock hospital married quarters on the Juno Bay {{side of the}} Island. The site contains four clearly marked graves and six other possible unmarked graves. All the known and potential graves are concentrated within a relatively small area near {{the middle of the}} dune. Of the four identified graves, three have headstones. The first is made of concrete with a Christian cross on top. The second grave has a cement rendered surround with a marble headstone on a concrete base (this is the only headstone which still has a discernable inscription). The third grave with a headstone has a small concrete cross studded with imbedded bivalve mollusc shells and decorated with synthetic fabric flowers. There are potential unmarked graves scattered around the marked graves and they have been identified on the basis of unusual stone arrangements, remnants of <b>dressed</b> <b>timber</b> and discrete fragmentary concentrations of grave furniture.|$|E
50|$|Between mid-1883 {{and late}} 1884, planing and {{dressing}} machinery to work soft timbers such as pine, cedar and beech were acquired; the Eucalypta, an 85 ft long steamer, {{was built for}} Burnett to transport cypress pine from the Moreton Bay islands (Amity Point on Stradbroke Island, Coochiemudlo Island and Macleay Island) and hardwood from the Tweed Heads, Nerang, Coomera and Logan River districts to his mill, the timber being unloaded at Hilliards Creek; a wharf with a large overhead travelling crane was erected on the creek about 300 yards below the mill buildings; a tramway was laid to transport logs from the wharf to the mill (in 1885 the tramway was extended about three-quarters of a mile to give {{direct access to the}} bay); and an 8-ton boiler was installed to generate the steam to drive the horizontal saw, circular saws, planning machines and lathes, which could produce 40,000 feet of <b>dressed</b> <b>timber</b> a week. The South Pacific Islanders had gone. In November 1884, Trafalgar Vale sawmill employed about 40 non-indentured workers, most of whom lived in cottages near the mill. By 1889 the number of employees had risen to 50. Several of Burnett's sons also worked in the family business.|$|E
50|$|The lighthouses were {{established}} and lit in 1903, automated in 1935; the North light was deactivated in the 1980s. The South light is still operational.The foundation materials are <b>dressed</b> stone and <b>timber</b> {{for the south}} light and concrete pier on crib for the North light. The lighthouses were constructed out of cast iron boiler plate. The tower has a conical bottle shape. It is white, with a black lantern. The original lenses installed in 1903 were fourth (south) and sixth order (North) Fresnel lenses.|$|R
50|$|The {{bell tower}} is {{constructed}} of heavy <b>dressed</b> and painted <b>timbers</b> {{and consists of}} four structural members forming legs which are strengthened by cross-bracing. It has a steeply pitched pagoda roof topped by a cross. Small acroteria decorate {{the corners of the}} roof, which is clad with corrugated iron. The tower is hung with a Burns & Oats bell. There is a bellringer's platform finished with cross braced balustrading, however, there is no stair to permit access and the legs of the tower are now exposed. The tower is visible from some streets away and is a local landmark.|$|R
50|$|The rural {{district}} which includes Deanmill had 405 residents {{as of the}} 2006 Census, 50.4% males and 49.6% females. The median age of persons in Deanmill was 39 years old, and 90.9% of residents were Australian citizens. The most common answers for occupation included labourers (27.4%), managers (18.4%), technicians and trades workers (12.4%), professionals (10.9%) and sales workers (9.5%), and the most common industries were log sawmilling and <b>timber</b> <b>dressing</b> (16.4%), school education (9.0%), growing of fruit and tree nuts (8.5%), farming of sheep, cattle and grain (4.0%) and State Government administration (3.5%). The median weekly household income was $821, compared with the Australian average of $1,027.|$|R
5000|$|If only a {{top plate}} was used, {{the top of}} each slab was pushed up into the groove (a mortise). The bottom of the slab was merely set into a trench. When a wall bottom plate was used, it was also mortised. [...] Each slab was slid in {{at one end of the}}se plates; on the bottom plate, an extra piece was cut out at one end of the groove to widen it and allow each slab to be fitted in: this piece was {{replaced}} after the last slab was inserted. Another method was to make a much deeper mortise in the top plate. In this case, each slab was lifted up into the deep top groove and then dropped into the bottom one. A third method was to nail planks either side of the wall plates to form a channel to hold the slabs, instead of mortising. This was a much quicker method of construction, but it required the use of sawn and <b>dressed</b> <b>timber,</b> and nails. Slabs were sometimes chamfered at one or both ends to fit into the mortises. Each method took more time and labour, and used more material, but produced a progressively more sophisticated and permanent structure.|$|E
50|$|A {{grass and}} dirt {{driveway}} sloping down the property {{along the west}} side gives access to the middle {{and lower levels of}} the complex. This driveway is also part of the easement shared with the adjoining property. A lean-to garage/loading dock and office stands approximately 15 metres down the slope and extends down this side of the building {{to the end of the}} former pre-fabrication workshop which it opens into. Sheltered by a skillion roof, timber framed and standing on tall round timber stumps, the loading/office area is partly enclosed to the west with a range of cladding materials including weatherboards and corrugated iron sheeting. A single-skin weatherboard clad partition separates the loading/office area from the pre-fabrication workshop. The pre-fabrication workshop is sheltered by two roofs - a sawtooth roof throwing southern light into the northern end of the space and a skillion roof to the balance. Timber framed, the workshop has exposed <b>dressed</b> <b>timber</b> trusses, sawn timber framing to the skillion roof, rough log beams and a steel beam across the south end. Rows of round timber posts support the roofs and the workshop stands on high round timber stumps. Enclosed to the east with vertical timber boards and open to the south, the workshop has a fine timber tongue and groove floor with a set of timber rails running along the centre of the floor to the narrow loading platform to the south. A trolley with metal wheels runs on the rails. Two sets of timber stairs descend to the sawmilling area to the rear of the complex. The understorey of the pre-fabrication workshop houses various pieces of equipment and timber storage and is enclosed to the southeast by corrugated metal sheeting.|$|E
2500|$|The Port Sanilac Light's {{foundation}} {{consists of}} <b>dressed</b> stone and <b>timber.</b> [...] The octagon-hourglass-shaped tower (near its top) {{is made of}} tiered and reverse stair-stepped brick. [...] It is [...] in diameter at its base, and tapers vertically to [...] diameter below the gallery. Eschewing the usual corbels, a dozen courses of bricks create the gallery support, with four indentations for windows, creating a watch room for the four points of the compass. [...] The lighthouse was built {{at a cost of}} $20,000. [...] The placement and the unique shape were dictated by and created because of budgetary constraints (Congress appropriated only half the money requested). [...] Designed by Eleventh District Engineer Captain Charles E. L. B. Davis, the design has been called [...] "both unique and architecturally significant in its elegance." [...] The tower is white with a red roof.|$|R
30|$|Direct {{construction}} costs {{in these three}} cases (values of (a), (b) and (c) in Fig.  8) were 88  % of current costs (values of actual condition) in case (a), 72  % in case (b), and 60  % in case (c). Compared with concrete check dams, however, the respective figures were 213  % in case (a), 173  % in case (b), and 144  % in case (c), showing that although they might be competitive with concrete check dams in terms of costs if these could be reduced {{to the level of}} case (c), further cost reductions or subsidies would be required to make them competitive in cases (a) and (b). To reduce the cost differential between their current structural forms and concrete check dams may require cost-cutting by means such as either a major reduction in the amount of timber used, which accounts for the greater part of material cost, or by promoting the commercialization of an on-site production system that integrates all the stages from timber procurement through to material preparation, processing, and construction at the construction site [23]. Focusing on the price of timber, to keep the direct {{construction costs}} of all-wood timber check dams in their present form down to around 1.5 times those for concrete check dams would require the price of <b>timber</b> (<b>dressed</b> on four sides) to fall to 42  % of its current level, and to 60  % of this level in case (a) and 78  % in case (b) above. The direct construction costs in the three cases described above were 158, 128, and 107  % of those for steel check dams in cases (a), (b), and (c), respectively. In case (c), the cost was very nearly equivalent to that for steel check dams, and even cases (a) and (b) might possibly be cost-competitive. The CO 2 emissions for all-wood timber check dams in these three cases were (a) 19.9 t-CO 2, (b) 16.0 t-CO 2, and (c) 14.7 t-CO 2, respectively. These results indicate cutting costs would also contribute to reducing CO 2 emissions at the same time.|$|R
