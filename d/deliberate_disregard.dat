40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. Touting, as practised by conveyancers in {{the four}} Northern provinces of South Africa, is {{reaching}} alarming proportions. Owing to the institutional nature of the attorneys' profession, rules and regulations are applied to establish and manage the ethical behaviour {{of members of the}} profession. The question arises as to whether there could be an alternative way of management with a value system and ethical conduct as the underlying principles. According to the organisational behavioural science, the alternative method is to manage an organisation by means of value driven leadership style. The research questions of this study are: 1. Which teleological and deontological values will be suitable as elements of a shared value system for the attorneys' profession? In order to reach this goal, the following objectives are established: 2. To obtain exhaustive knowledge of the concepts 'values' and 'value-driven' by means of a literature study and empirical research {{in order to understand the}} phenomenon touting, as practised in the attorneys' profession. This objective was reached through an investigation of the concepts values and value-driven. The focus was particularly on the following aspects: J the development of the concept values J the principles of values and ethics 4 the division and classification of the concept values 4 the role and application of the concept values in management science and J values and leadership Based on the results of the limited availability sample, the empirical findings were that the respondents are ethically sensitive. It is evident that touting is a <b>deliberate</b> and unconstitutional <b>disregard</b> of instrumental and terminal values, and that the promotion of self-interest leads to the detriment of the principal, the profession and the public. 3. To establish the shared values of the attorneys' profession from the perspective of the deontology and teleology. This objective was reached through a literature study into the concepts value driven and shared values. From this investigation, it is evident that a relationship no doubt exists between terminal and instrumental values on the one hand and teleological and deontological values on the other hand. The investigation further found that specific effective teleological and deontological values are contained in the sources of knowledge of the attorneys' profession. These values can be used to develop a shared value system for the attorneys' profession. The results of the study, based on a limited availability sample indicate that the majority of respondents could not identify the critical value, namely to guard against self-interest. The absence of this value implies touting within the context of this investigation. 4. To identify and describe the ways and means of the transformation of the attorneys' profession from a rule-and-regulation orientation to a value-driven orientation with regard to ethical behaviour. In order to reach this objective, an empirical investigation was undertaken into the perceptions of respondents of a specific availability sample in regard of the existing rules applicable to ethical behaviour and their perception of the Law Societies of South Africa. The empirical investigation in regard to the perceptions show that a substantial portion of the respondents perception of the Law Societies of South Africa is negative - founded on the reality experience that the Law Societies of South Africa is not capable of cracking down on touting. The literature study demonstrates that the attorneys' profession is a learning organisation with an institutional culture. Transformation from a rule-and-regulation orientation to a value-driven orientation in regard to values and ethics, among others, requires a transformation of way of thinking in regard to basic assumptions concerning values and ethics. In summarising, it can be stated that this investigation produced evidence that effective teleological and deontological values are contained in the sources of knowledge of the attorneys' profession, that can be used to create a shared value system for the profession.

[...] Peer Gynt was first performed in Christiania (now Oslo) on 24 February 1876, with original music composed by Edvard Grieg that includes some of today's most recognized classical pieces, In the Hall of the Mountain King and Morning Mood. It was published in German translation in 1881, in English in 1892, and in French in 1896. The contemporary influence of the play continues into the twenty-first century.|$|E

In particular Spain's territories in Louisiana (New France) (and the newly reconquered West Florida) would be severely threatened if the American trend of economic growth based on expanded land holdings continued. The situation of the American Indians in these lands was noted, but for practical purposes ignored because they could not significantly defend themselves. In their opposition to this expansion, ironically, the French and Spanish governments were effectively supporting the British on one of the points which had begun the move towards revolution in the 1760s—the use of military forces (paid for by taxes) to maintain a clear border between the colonies and the American Indian lands west of the Appalachians. Meanwhile, the American case was strengthened by the charters of the earliest colonies, which specified, in <b>deliberate</b> <b>disregard</b> of the claims of other nations, that they could expand from the east coast of America to the west coast.|$|E

50|$|Chancellor Chandler {{noted that}} the case could only rest on gross negligence, which means ‘reckless {{indifference}} to or a <b>deliberate</b> <b>disregard</b> of the whole body of stockholders’ or actions which are ‘without the bounds of reason’. He noted for this reason ‘duty of care violations are rarely found'. Then he remarked how good corporate standards are aspirations that change, but fiduciary duties are law that do not. He said Eisner’s decision to hire Ovtiz was a business judgment. To counter that, gross negligence or bad faith must be shown. He said he rightly informed himself of all the facts, so was not grossly negligent (even if the behavior should not serve as a model, ‘especially at having enthroned himself as the omnipotent and infallible monarch of his personal Magic Kingdom’). It was in good faith, with a subjective belief that he was right and in the company’s best interests. The other compensation committee members were considered but let off. Poitier and Lozano were entirely uninvolved, but {{it was concluded that}} neither were grossly negligent or acted in bad faith. He said that in Smith v. Van Gorkom the sale for $735m of TransUnion was much more significant to the company than Ovitz’s hiring here. And TransUnion had absolutely no documentation before it when it considered the merger agreement. The compensation committee here was provided with a term sheet for all the key points of the employment contract. TransUnion’s senior management completely opposed the merger, but here everyone saw hiring Ovitz as a ‘boon for the Company’. So Poitier and Lozano did not ‘intentionally disregard a duty to act, nor did they bury their heads in the sand knowing a decision had to be made. They acted in a manner that they believed was {{in the best interests of}} the company.|$|E
5000|$|In 1985, the Delaware Supreme Court passed one of {{its most}} debated judgments, Smith v Van Gorkom. The {{directors}} of TransUnion, including Jerome W. Van Gorkom, were sued by the shareholders for failing to adequately research the corporation's value, before approving a sale price of $55 per share to the Marmon Group. The Court held that to be a protected business judgment, [...] "the directors of a corporation have acted on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was {{in the best interests of}} the company." [...] Failing to act on an informed basis, if it caused loss, would amount to gross negligence, and here the directors were liable. The decision triggered a panic among corporate boards which believed they would be exposed to massive liability, and insurance firms who feared rising costs of providing directors and officers liability insurance to corporate boards. In response to lobbying, the Delaware General Corporation Law was amended to insert a new §102(b)(7). This allowed corporations to give directors immunity from liability for breach of the duty of care in their charter. However, for those corporations which did not introduce liability waivers, the courts subsequently proceeded to reduce the duty of care outright. In 1996, In re Caremark International Inc. Derivative Litigation required [...] "an utter failure to attempt to assure a reasonable information and reporting system exists", and in 2003 In re Walt Disney Derivative Litigation went further. Chancellor Chandler held directors could only be liable for showing [...] "reckless indifference to or a <b>deliberate</b> <b>disregard</b> of the whole body of stockholders" [...] through actions that are [...] "without the bounds of reason". In one of the cases that came out of the Global Financial Crisis, the same line of reasoning was deployed in In re Citigroup Inc Shareholder Derivative Litigation. Chancellor Chandler, confirming his previous opinions in Re Walt Disney and the dicta of Re Caremark, held that the directors of Citigroup could not be liable for failing to have a warning system in place to guard against potential losses from sub-prime mortgage debt. Although there had been several indications of the significant risks, and Citigroup's practices along with its competitors were argued to have contributed to crashing the international economy, Chancellor Chandler held that [...] "plaintiffs would ultimately have to prove bad faith conduct by the director defendants". This suggested that Delaware law had effectively negated any substantive duty of care. This suggested that corporate directors were exempt from duties that any other professional performing services would owe. Itt remained unclear, with a change in the Chief Justice of the Delaware Supreme Court in 2014, whether this position would remain.|$|E

40|$|The lack {{of civil}} {{discourse}} on the eight interactive global crises (i. e., human economy, climate change, exponential human population growth, ecological overshoot, biotic impoverishment and reduction of biodiversity, renewable resource depletion, energy allocation, and environmental refugees) is frightening, since they could, individually or collectively, destroy civilization as presently known. Some crises elicit hostile exchanges (e. g., climate change). For others, discussion is essentially taboo (e. g., exponential human population growth). For still others, rhetoric is plentiful but has little substantive remedial action (human economy). For far too many, public and political literacy is too low (e. g., ecological overshoot, renewable resource depletion, environmental refugees). Discussion on the climate crisis is blocked by advocates of old sources of energy (e. g., fossil fuel) who fear loss of revenue resulting from competition from new sources of energy. A common factor in all eight crises is either ignorance about or <b>deliberate</b> <b>disregard</b> of the universal laws of physics, chemistry, and biology. Another {{important factor in the}} lack of discourse is an unwillingness to consider remedial measures if they might threaten human economic growth.

40|$|This {{article is}} an attempt to {{demonstrate}} the power of non-conformity with regard to literary projections. Though written in 1969, Miriam Tlali’s novel, Muriel at Metropolitan exhibits forceful portrayals of Apartheid South Africa’s socio-economic and political system. The novel explores, in the crudest manner possible, the realities of racial inequality in South African society. Tlali, in my view, succeeds in her intentions of telling the South African story exactly as it was by ignoring the existing literary conventions. Her chosen form of literary creation was deliberate; as she was certainly not unaware of the conventional forms of literary expression. Her <b>deliberate</b> <b>disregard</b> of conventional forms of literary creation was frowned upon by such critics as Njabulo Ndebele and caused much debate on the relativity of literature in the 60 ’s, 70 ’s and 80 ’s. This article also attempts to show how ideological persuasions, in some cases, influence the creation of literary works, as it was the case with Protest Fiction. Perhaps by visiting texts of old, particularly vilified and marginalized ones, we can learn to appreciate the fact that we cannot confine literary art to conventional forms alone; the diversity of a society and its particular conditions may sometimes require unconventional forms for its literary portrayals. The point here is that Tlali chooses to portray the harsh truths about racial relations in South Africa in a manner that reflects surface levels of that reality. It is poignant {{to point out that the}} irony of the South African condition is that much of the ills of the Apartheid system still infest the South African Society. Political masters have changed but conditions are basically more or less the same. South Africa needs writers like Miriam Tlali to mirro...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} whether arbitrators’ {{application of}} the wrong substantive law is a ground for challenge of arbitral awards. The topic is divided into the theoretical question of whether to refer the arbitrators’ {{application of the}} wrong substantive law to excess of mandate or procedural irregularity, and the practical question of how national courts handle the demarcation problems that occur in review of awards. The scope of the thesis is limited to challenges on the grounds excess of mandate and procedural irregularity under section 34 of the Swedish Arbitration Act (SAA). [1] The SAA has thereby served {{as a basis for}} the study, but the legislative history, case law and doctrine have also been important. The thesis finds that arbitrators’ application of the wrong substantive law could in theory constitute both excess of mandate and procedural irregularity. However, there are several demarcation problems that occur in practice because it is difficult to distinguish between substantive and procedural errors. Therefore, it seems like only a <b>deliberate</b> <b>disregard</b> of the parties’ choice of law could lead to awards being set aside. Throughout the thesis, the interests of party autonomy and finality of awards are weighed against one another with the conclusion that theory seems to emphasize party autonomy whereas practice seems to emphasize finality of awards. The thesis provides an alternative school of thought of how national courts’ could handle demarcation problems to allow for a wider scope of review on the provision procedural irregularity. This would permit review of also substantive matters to ensure that no significant procedural error has occurred and thus, it would lead to a better balance between party autonomy and finality of awards.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{humanitarian}} arms control {{emerged in the}} context of the new security challenges of the 21 st century. The 1997 Ban on Anti-Personnel Mines, the 2001 Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons (PoA) and the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions all set out to introduce arms control instruments to regulate not only uncontrolled transfers of arms, but also to end or to limit the indiscriminate use of weapons, and to deal with the long-term effects following intra-state conflicts. The three institutions share similar characteristics and thus permit the conclusion that a structural change has taken place in arms control and disarmament. This change is a consequence of the changed security environment after the end of the Cold War: Fragile statehood, economic under-development, internal state conflicts, terrorism and transnational organized crime provided the international state community with new challenges calling for different and new forms of arms control. This report identifies the indicators for this change and examines the reasons for the development of particular forms of arms control and disarmament. The three regimes banning anti-personnel mines and cluster munitions and restricting the illicit trafficking of small arms and light weapons all show similar characteristics which were decisive for their evolution and have given a new face to arms control as a whole. The key normative agents that were decisive for this structural change included transnational campaigns by non-governmental organizations as well as a number of small and medium-sized states. These alliances managed to get the arms control agreements off the ground despite opposition from the leading powers. Two factors were remarkable: On the one hand, the special negotiating formats which were set up for the Ottawa and Oslo processes and, on the other hand, “new diplomacy”, which was characterized by a mutual “give and take” between the different actors. By involving NGOs, like-minded states sought global public support and gained additional legitimacy for their ambivalent undertaking. By granting civil society stakeholders the right to participate in the negotiations, these states also enabled NGOs to gain certain influence on the norm generation processes. The change of perspective on arms control also becomes visible in a different, individualized understanding of security. Instead of concentrating exclusively on improving state’s security, attention is now being increasingly directed towards human security. Embedded in the concept of “human security”, one finds references to larger concepts such as development aims and conflict resolution practices. Humanitarian arms control is concerned with mitigating the consequences of the use of weapons as well as their deliberate misuse during and following intra-state conflicts. This new understanding of arms control lies within the wider context of security sector reform, which seeks to make fragile states capable of guaranteeing public security again, but it also addresses individual human needs in post-conflict situations such as victim rehabilitation and reintegration. The new arms control and disarmament agreements are an outcome of specific normgenerating processes which are to be seen {{in the context of}} “new humanitarianism”. The most visible expression and, at the same time, probably the most controversial expression II of this new humanitarianism are a number of military interventions in response to gross violations of human rights and the <b>deliberate</b> <b>disregard</b> of international humanitarian law, as for example in Ruanda or Bosnia. Questions of justice are becoming the direct legitimization for state action and have also inspired and triggered norm-generation processes in other policy fields – for example, the establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC). Moral convictions or questions of justice also motivated norm generating actors in the field of humanitarian arms control. In all three cases under consideration, the need for a new institution was determined by the moral conviction that action must be taken against numerous incidents of severe injustice where innocent people and civilians were killed or wounded by the indiscriminate use of these weapons in cases of intra-state conflicts. This conviction is based on one of the few global concepts of justice in international relations which is also anchored in international humanitarian law, such as the principle of need and proportionality. At the same time, this moral conviction has provided the basis for norm development in the field of humanitarian arms control: The suffering of the civilian population as a result of the use of antipersonnel mines or cluster munitions prompted non-governmental organizations to demand of states to take action and seek a norm banning the use of such weapons. Certain convictions of justice, which seem to be shared in the international system of states, were finally enshrined in the principles, norms and procedures of the three regimes. According to the principle of equality, for example, all states parties must renounce the use of anti-personnel mines or cluster munitions and compile an overview of their national stocks of small arms. A further characteristic of humanitarian arms control is the comprehensive application of the principles of proportionality, need and compensation. For example, the costs-by-cause principle applies to the clearance of cluster munitions. Those states which are particularly affected can rely on technical as well as financial support under the Ban on Anti-Personnel Mines and the Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons. This structural change towards humanitarian arms control is significant for arms control and for disarmament as a whole. However, the moral convictions and the principles of justice demanded by the NGOs in particular touched the limits of national and national security interests. Normative conflicts occurred in the negotiating processes of all three regimes; particularly over question of the appropriate definition of weapons categories, but also with regard to the possible renunciation of sovereignty, for example banning transfers of arms to non-state actors or prohibiting the private possession of weapons. Although the principles of proportionality, necessity and compensation and the recognition of the special needs of the affected states provided an important impetus for the negotiations, the actual implementation process, particularly of the PoA, has been very slow. Das Anti-Personenminenverbot von 1997, das Kleinwaffenaktionsprogramm von 2001 und die Streubombenkonvention von 2008 weisen auf einen Formenwandel in der Rüstungskontrolle hin. Alle drei Regime fokussieren stärker die menschliche Sicherheit und vertreten sicherheits- wie entwicklungspolitische Ziele. Die entscheidenden Initiatoren waren Nichtregierungsorganisationen, transnationale Kampagnen und Klein- und Mittelmächte, die, vereint durch überkulturelle Gerechtigkeitsvorstellungen, zu Normunternehmern wurden. Sie förderten neue Verhandlungsformen und konfrontierten die bestehende politische Verhandlungskultur mit einem diplomatischen Miteinander. Simone Wisotzki ermittelt die Indikatoren des Formenwandels, stellt die Gründe dar und benennt die Probleme, wenn globale Ziele der humanitären Rüstungskontrolle mit nationalstaatlichen Sicherheitsinteressen kollidieren. Sie verweist auf die Herausforderungen, die nach wie vor zu bewältigen sind, etwa die fehlenden globalen Normen zur Begrenzung des staatlichen Waffenhandels in Kriegs- und Krisengebiete, und fordert eindringlich, weitere Normentwicklung in der humanitären Rüstungskontrolle zu unterstützen...|$|E
