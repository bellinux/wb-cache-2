40|$|Caching popular {{contents}} is {{a promising}} way to offload the mobile data traffic in wireless networks, {{but so far}} the potential advantage of caching in improving physical layer security (PLS) is rarely considered. In this paper, we contribute to the design and theoretical understanding of exploiting the caching ability of users to improve the PLS in a wireless heterogeneous network (HetNet). In such network, the base station (BS) <b>ensures</b> <b>the</b> <b>secrecy</b> of communication by utilizing some of the available power to transmit a pre-cached file, such that only the eavesdropper's channel is degraded. Accordingly, the node locations of BSs, users and eavesdroppers are first modeled as mutually independent poisson point processes (PPPs) and the corresponding file access protocol is developed. We then derive analytical expressions of two metrics, average secrecy rate and secrecy coverage probability, for the proposed system. Numerical results are provided to show the significant security advantages of the proposed network and to characterize the impact of network resource on <b>the</b> <b>secrecy</b> metrics.

3000|$|The {{differentiating}} {{feature of}} the model studied in this work from those described above including [11] is that the destination has transmission capability.

In an effort to address a practical two-hop communication scenario, we shall consider each node to be half-duplex, which leads to a two-phase communication model. In addition, feedback to the source is not considered in the channel model. Interestingly, in this model, the transmission capability of the destination proves to be the enabler of secure communication. By recruiting the help of the destination to do [...] "cooperative jamming", positive secrecy rate can be achieved {{that would not have been}} possible otherwise.
