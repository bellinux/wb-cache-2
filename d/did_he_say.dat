500|$|Nielsen's {{supporting}} role of Dr. Rumack in Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker's 1980's Airplane! {{was a turning}} point in his career. The film, a parody of disaster films such as Zero Hour! and Airport, was based on building a comedy around actors known for dramatic roles. Other stars included Robert Stack, Peter Graves, and Lloyd Bridges. Nielsen's deadpan delivery contrasted with the absurdity surrounding him. When asked, [...] "Surely you can't be serious?", he responded with a curt, [...] "I am serious. And don't call me Shirley." [...] In several interviews he reflected on the line: [...] "I thought it was amusing, but {{it never occurred to me}} that it was going to become a trademark. It's such a surprise... the thing comes out, people say, 'What <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say?!</b> Nielsen said he was [...] "pleased and honored that [...] had a chance to deliver that line." [...] As of 2010, the comedic exchange was at No.79 on the American Film Institute's AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes. The American Film Institute included the film in its list of the top ten comedy films of all time in 2008, and a 2007 survey in the United Kingdom judged it the second greatest comedy film of all time. In 2012 Empire magazine voted it No.1 in The 50 Funniest Comedies Ever poll. Critics praised the film, which also proved a long-term success with audiences. In 2010 Airplane! was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.|$|E
2500|$|Hakluyt {{also wanted}} to include in this colony [...] "condemned English men and women, in whom there may be founde hope of amendment". However, nowhere did Hakluyt mention {{whether or not the}} Cimarrones would be {{involved}} in self-government like the other colonists, but nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> they would be held in bondage. England did not accept Hakluyt's proposal for a colony, but within five years in 1585, Sir Walter Raleigh had established the Roanoke Colony.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, young Habib {{spent his}} summer {{vacations}} in Monastir, among women who he helped with chores: help the servant called Fatma, bring the Baklava tray {{to the oven}} of uncle Hamida, monitor cooking then basting a ladle of honey or participating in the olive grove process. He also {{spent a lot of}} time with his father who insisted that he pursued with a studious education so he could avoid Ali's fate in the army: [...] "I do not want you to be cut back like a workhorse. I do not want you to be like me, sentenced to wear a kit on your shoulders, all day long", <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> to his son. At the end of the holidays, he returned to his brother's in Tunis where, after lessons, he strolled streets and admired the bey coming, on each Thursday to the Kasbah, to chair the seal ceremony. He was also marked with the 2011 Jellaz Affair which ended with the execution of Manoubi Djardjar in Bab Saadoun, where he noticed the hostility and mocking laughter of preponderants. The exiles and repression following the Tramway boycott aiming to protest against the Jellaz issue, soon created an atmosphere of revolt and contestation.|$|E

6000|$|Having done so I ask the {{attention}} of this audience to the question whether I have succeeded in sustaining the charge, and whether Judge Douglas has at all succeeded in rebutting it? You all heard me call upon him to say which of these pieces of evidence was a forgery. <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> that what I present here as {{a copy of the}} original Toombs bill is a forgery? <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> that what I present as a copy of the bill reported by himself is a forgery, or what is presented as a transcript from the Globe of the quotations from Bigler's speech is a forgery? <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> the quotations from his own speech are forgeries? <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> this transcript from Trumbull's speech is a forgery? ...|$|R

2500|$|On 15 December, Robert Barton was {{questioned}} by Kevin O'Higgins about his notes on Lloyd George's statement about signing the agreement or facing {{a renewal of}} war: [...] "Did Mr Lloyd George single Mr Barton out as the left wing of the delegation and <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say,</b> 'The man who is against peace may bear now and forever the responsibility for terrible and immediate war?'" [...] Barton replied: [...] "What he did say was that the signature and the recommendation of {{every member of the}} delegation was necessary, or war would follow immediately and that the responsibility for that war must rest directly upon those who refused to sign the Treaty". This was seized upon by opponents of the treaty as a convenient proof that the Irish delegates had been subjected to duress at the last minute, and [...] "terrible and immediate war" [...] became a catch-phrase in the debates that followed. The next day, de Valera took up this point: [...] "... therefore what happened was that over there a threat of immediate force upon our people was made. I believe that that document was signed under duress and, though I have a moral feeling that any agreement entered into ought to be faithfully carried out, I have no hesitation in saying that I would not regard it as binding on the Irish nation." ...|$|E
