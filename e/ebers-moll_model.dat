This model is developed from others which provide compatibil-ity {{with the standard}} <b>Ebers-Moll</b> macro <b>model</b> used in SPICE-based simulators, while the discontinuity in the valence band (∆Ev) is now included. Fur-thermore, the model can also be applied to both uniform-base and graded-base HBTs.

Different mechanisms for the transmission of holes and elec-trons due to differences in the conduction and va-lence band discontinuities across the heterojunction are tackled by separately modelling the electron and the hole currents. The model is written using SPICE-like formulae; hence the SPICE parameters for an HBT can be easily extracted from the model and au-tomatically added into the technology library for an IC design CAD tool. This leads to the possibility of observing the effect of a transistor profile on cir-cuit performance, and hence optimising the transistor profile.

We design an algorithm to estimate the transistor parameters, based on noisy measurements of the output voltage when the input voltage is a sine wave of variable frequency and constant amplitude. The common emitter amplifier circuit has been modelled using the transistor Ebers-Moll equations and the perturbation technique {{has been used for}} separating the linear and nonlinear parts of the <b>Ebers-Moll</b> equations. This <b>model</b> of the amplifier has been used to determine the amplitude of the output sinusoid {{as a function of the}} frequency and the parameter vector.

As compared to the conventional time-domain least squares method, the proposed method requires much less data storage and it results in more accurate parameter estimation, as it exploits the information in the time and frequency domain, simultaneously. The proposed method can be utilized for parameter estimation of an analog device in its operating range of frequencies, as it uses data collected from different frequencies output signals for parameter estimation.

In the last fifteen years, this powerful mathematical tool has been extensively used to find closed-form expressions for currents or voltages in circuits containing diodes.

40|$|In this paper, {{a compact}} dynamic and fully coupled {{electrothermal}} model for parasitic BJT latchup is presented and validated by measurements. The {{model can be}} used to enhance the reliability of the latest generation of commercially available power devices. BJT latchup can be triggered by body-diode reverse-recovery hard commutation with high dV/dt or from avalanche conduction during unclamped inductive switching. In the case of body-diode reverse recovery, the base current that initiates BJT latchup is calculated from the solution of the ambipolar diffusion equation describing the minority carrier distribution in the antiparallel p-i-n body diode. For hard commutation with high dV/dt, the displacement current of the drain-body charging capacitance is critical for BJT latchup, whereas for avalanche conduction, the base current is calculated from impact ionization.

The collapse of current-gain is an undesirable phenomenon, which occurs in multi-finger HBTs {{when they are}} operated at high power density. The collapse manifests itself by a distinct abrupt decrease of collector current in the output characteristics of the HBT.
