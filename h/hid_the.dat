She suffered a severe heart attack in 1955, followed by a possible second attack, and then developed pneumonia which required an extended stay in the hospital. She <b>hid</b> <b>the</b> severity of her health problems, but some details became public. Upon release from the hospital, McCracken was told by her doctors that she could no longer dance.

40|$|Steganography is a {{technique}} of <b>hiding</b> <b>the</b> data in images. It is derived from Greek word that means “Covered”.

5|$|On 14 June, Ilić went to Tuzla {{to bring}} the weapons to Sarajevo. Miško Jovanović <b>hid</b> <b>the</b> weapons in a large box of sugar. On 15 June, the two went {{separately}} by train to Doboj where Jovanović handed off the box to Ilić. Later that day, Ilić returned to Sarajevo by train, being careful to transfer to a local train outside Sarajevo and then quickly transfer to a tram to avoid police detection. Once at his mother's house, Ilić <b>hid</b> <b>the</b> weapons in a suitcase under a sofa. Then, on approximately 17 June, Ilić traveled to Brod (Dedijer puts it on 16 June, but trial records put it on 18 June). Questioned at trial, Ilić gave a confused explanation {{of the reason for}} his trip, first saying he had gone to Brod to prevent the assassination and then saying he had returned to Sarajevo from Brod to prevent the assassination. Dedijer puts forward the thesis (citing Bogijević) that Ilić went to Brod to meet an emissary of Apis, Djuro Ŝarac, who had instructions to cancel the assassination and then later Rade Malobabić was dispatched from Serbia to Sarajevo to reauthorize the assassination.|$|E

Virgil went around the corner on Allen Street to the Wells Fargo office, where he picked up a 10-gauge or 12-gauge, short, double-barreled shotgun. It was an unusually cold and windy day in Tombstone, and Virgil was wearing a long overcoat.

40|$|This study {{combines}} {{the notion of}} both steganography [1] and visual cryptography [2]. Recently, a number of innovative algorithms have been proposed {{in the fields of}} steganography and visual cryptography with the goals of improving security, reliability, and efficiency; because there will be always new kinds of threats in the field of information hiding. Actually Steganography and visual cryptography are two sides of a coin. Visual cryptography has the problem of revealing the existence of <b>the</b> <b>hidden</b> data where as Steganography <b>hides</b> <b>the</b> existence of <b>hidden</b> data. Here this study is to suggest multiple layers of encryption by <b>hiding</b> <b>the</b> <b>hidden</b> data. <b>Hiding</b> <b>the</b> <b>hidden</b> data means, first encrypting the information using visual cryptography and then <b>hide</b> <b>the</b> share/s[3] into images or audio files using steganography.

Raziel attacks Kain while the latter continues to adjust the Chronoplast's controls. Although Raziel eventually gains an advantage, the Chronoplast activates, and Kain escapes through a time portal, beckoning Raziel to follow. Raziel complies, ignoring warnings from The Elder God. As the game ends, Raziel emerges from the timeslip and is greeted by Moebius, leading into the events of Soul Reaver 2.|$|E

5|$|Dishonoreds stealth {{system was}} {{originally}} {{based on that}} of the Thief series, which uses level lighting and shadows to determine whether an enemy can detect the player character's presence.

It was also considered that making certain areas dark <b>hid</b> <b>the</b> designers' work and contrasted poorly with well-lit areas. Much of the ambient dialogue was written to be lengthy and add background detail to the game world and to entertain stealth players who may be in a single area for a long time. Conversely, main story dialogue was written to be short to compensate for the player being able to interrupt or kill the character who is speaking.|$|E

This is followed by retaliation against humans by chickens, chicken-rights groups, and eventually recognition of chickens as humans by the United Nations. During this time, Elmer becomes a syndicated columnist in a newspaper and writes about chicken-related topics, both light-hearted and serious. The peace between humans and chickens is disrupted in the late 1980s by an outbreak of bird flu. Millions of healthy chickens are killed by humans {{to prevent the spread}} of the disease, and Ben hides Elmer and Helen again. When others come for them, Ben intervenes and is accidentally shot protecting Elmer. Once the flu is contained, humanity expresses regret for its rash actions and Elmer writes a scathing editorial about the panic. His journal entries become less frequent after he and Helen have children.|$|E
5|$|George I died on 11/22 June 1727 {{during one}} of his visits to Hanover, and George II succeeded him as king and elector at the age of 43. The new king decided not to travel to Germany for his father's funeral, which far from {{bringing}} criticism led to praise from the English who considered it proof of his fondness for England. He suppressed his father's will because it attempted to split the Hanoverian succession between George II's future grandsons rather than vest all the domains (both in Britain and Hanover) in a single person. Both British and Hanoverian ministers considered the will unlawful, as George I did not have the legal power to determine the succession personally. Critics supposed that George II <b>hid</b> <b>the</b> will to avoid paying out his father's legacies.|$|E
