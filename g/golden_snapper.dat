Sweetlip {{is the most}} common table fish caught off the island, while other fish species include: coral trout, red emperor, <b>golden</b> <b>snapper,</b> nannegai and parrot fish. In winter fish species including spanish mackerel, grey mackerel, giant trevally, giant leatherskin, queenfish, northern blue fin tuna, and cobia can be caught. Accommodation, meals and boats are available at the Sweers Island Resort.|$|E
5000|$|The eastern nannygai, redfish, bight redfish, red snapper, <b>golden</b> <b>snapper</b> or koarea (Centroberyx affinis) is an {{alfonsino}} of {{the genus}} Centroberyx. It is found around Australia and New Zealand at depths between 10 and 450 m on the continental shelf. It can reach lengths of up to 51.0 cm SL. It forms schools near the sea floor over rocky reefs and mud at dawn and dusk, splitting up at night to feed on mollusks, crustaceans, and small fish. Its young live in estuaries and shallow coastal waters.|$|E
50|$|Lutjanus johnii, {{commonly}} known as John's snapper or <b>golden</b> <b>snapper,</b> is a marine fish native to the western Pacific and Indian Oceans, from East Africa to Fiji and Australia. In Queensland, Northern Territory {{and other parts of}} Australia it is perhaps known more commonly as Fingermark bream, and is arguably one of the best estuary eating fish. The former name ('Golden snapper') is generally used when the fish is in much larger sizes, with juveniles and young adults usually referred to as the latter ('Fingermark'). It has a remarkably slow growth rate, so release is encouraged and bag limits apply. It can grow to approximately 8 kg in weight although 10 kg fish have been recorded off the coast of Cairns, though even a small individual will provide a substantial fight. They are not recommended to be targeted for catch and release when fishing in depths of 10 m or over, as the species is highly susceptible to barotrauma. Fingermark encounters often occur when targeting other species such as barramundi, and can be distinguished by their golden-brown to reddish skin tint and dark 'fingermark' beneath the dorsal fin - colourations both lost as the species dies once taken from the water or grows in size. Colourations are extremely prominent in juvenile fish. They are members of the Lutjanus genus of snappers, which also includes mangrove jack and other well-known table species.|$|E

5000|$|Dorenbos {{attended}} Pacifica High School in Garden Grove, California, {{where he}} was a letterman in football, basketball, hockey and baseball. He earned all-league honors in football and baseball. He made Dean's list and was an honor roll student in high school. Dorenbos originally attended Golden West College in Huntington Beach, California. During his freshman year, his best friend who was attending University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), Paul Tessier, called to ask if he would like to be the long snapper for the UTEP Miners football team, which needed one. At the time, Dorenbos was not the long <b>snapper</b> at <b>Golden</b> West; he played linebacker and fullback. He took some video footage from high school, added footage of the <b>Golden</b> West long <b>snapper,</b> and sent it to the coaches at UTEP. He was eventually recruited and became the long snapper for UTEP in 23 games over three seasons. He averaged almost 10 tackles each year at UTEP on punt coverage. Dorenbos earned a business degree from UTEP, with emphasis in economics, finance and marketing.|$|R
40|$|Thirty-four {{microsatellite}} loci {{were isolated}} from three reef fish species; <b>golden</b> <b>snapper</b> Lutjanus johnii, blackspotted croaker Protonibea diacanthus and grass emperor Lethrinus laticaudis using a {{next generation sequencing}} approach. Both IonTorrent single reads and Illumina MiSeq paired-end reads were used, with the latter demonstrating a higher quality of reads than the IonTorrent. From the 1 - 1. 5 million raw reads per species, we successfully obtained 10 - 13 polymorphic loci for each species, which satisfied stringent design criteria. We developed multiplex panels for the amplification of the <b>golden</b> <b>snapper</b> and the blackspotted croaker loci, as well as post-amplification pooling panels for the grass emperor loci. The microsatellites characterized in this work were tested across three locations of northern Australia. The microsatellites we developed can detect population differentiation across northern Australia and {{may be used for}} genetic structure studies and stock identification...|$|E
40|$|Reproductive aspects and {{information}} {{on the effect of}} fishery activities over this species stock are scarce, despite the imperative need of effective protection and resource management programs. To support the possible establishment of closed seasons and catch levels for the area, our study aimed to evaluate the spawning season of the <b>Golden</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus inermis). For this, fish caught by artisanal fisheries in the Navidad, Tenacatita and Chamela bays (Jalisco, Mexico) were sampled monthly from 1999 - 2008, and analyzed sex ratios, spawning season and size at first maturity. A total of 311 (53. 1 %) females and 275 (46. 9 %) males were caught, and the observed sex ratio was 1 : 0. 88. The total length range was 14. 4 - 37. 0 cm and total weight range from 48 - 575 g. The length at first maturity was 23. 9 cm TL for females and 23. 6 cm TL for males. The gonadosomatic index showed two principal reproductive periods in the year (February-April and September-November), when the largest number of mature gonads were observed. Ovaries were of asynchronic development type and seven oocyte development stages were identified. Testicles showed lobular development and spermatozoa were observed {{in the center of the}} cysts and in the collecting ducts. It is important to mention that our results support the current suitable exploitation of this species in the area...|$|E
40|$|The {{trend of}} fish {{production}} in Singapore is towards increasing contribution from marine and brackishwater aquaculture. Aquaculture production in 1986 represented 6. 8 % of local fish production. It is envisaged that this sector will provide about 37. 5 % of production by 1995. Freshwater aquaculture will focus mainly on production of ornamental fish. Production from farming of freshwater food fish {{is not likely}} to increase significantly. Commonly farmed marine finfishes are groupers (Epinephelus tauvina), sea bass (Lates calcarifer), and <b>golden</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus johni). Crustaceans include prawns (Penaeus merguiensis), crabs (Scylla serrata) and mussels (Perna viridis). Of the freshwater finfishes, the most commonly cultured are the grass, silver and bighead carps, red tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus hybrid), Lampam jawa (Puntius gonionotus), marble goby (Oxyleotrix marmorata) and the snakehead (Channa sp.). Aquaculture systems use a combination of floating and shorebased techniques. Earthen ponds are utilized for the culture of freshwater carps, floating netcages for marine finfish, ponds and floating netcages for marine crustaceans, and rope culture for mussels. Some research and development studies conducted presently include maturation studies {{to solve the problem of}} inconsistent supply of prawn spawners, experiments or use of dry formulated feed to do away with dependency on trash fish as main feed for grow-out marine finfish, and investigations on diseases of prawns under intensive culture. Constraints for large-scale production of finfish seeds lie in the large tank facilities required for producing live feed; for nursery operations, time and manpower required for grading and feeding; for growout systems, disease prevention and control; for prawn production, inconsistent spawner supply; and for mussel production, low consumer demand. The species with the highest potential for fanning in Singapore is the banana prawn, Penaeus merguiensis as its culture can be intensified and high yields can be obtained...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} has been initiated to assist the fish scales entrepreneur in Malaysia into getting a consistent fish scales dye process. Several tests on colouring dyes have been conducted to establish a suitable dye with consistent measuring techniques. With the above objectives in mind, the researcher hoped to establish a colour guideline in form of colour tones thus provides a wider choice of colour selection to these entrepreneurs. John Snapper or <b>Golden</b> <b>Snapper</b> " Jenahak" from (Lutjanus johni family), Malabar Red Snapper "Merah" from (Lutjanus malabaricus family), Threadfish Bream" Kerisi" from (Nemipteridae family) and Herring or Toli Shad" Terubok" from (Clupeidae family) were the four types of salt water fish selected for their scales for this research as {{they are the most}} caught by Malaysian fishermen. In the early stage of this experiment the researcher tried to find a suitable cleaning substance and process to wash these fish scales. Three types of cleaning agent were then tested such as detergent, lime juice and bleach. Ofthe three, lime juice produced the best result. Some other experiments conducted were the crushing test, burning test, pounding test and baking test. They are to determine the durability quality of these fish scales. The fish scales were then tested for colouring suitability. Five different types of fabric dyes were selected such as disperse dye, reactive dye, vat dye, pigment dye and natural dye. Out of these five types, Cool Reactive dye from Remazol brand gave the best colour reaction on these scales. The weighing technique was then established using grams for colours and litre for measuring water. Prior to this the researcher had used a spoon for measuring the colour quantity and cups for measuring the amount of water where it produced an inconsistent colour tones. Based on the colour tones obtained from the experiments, the researcher were able to establish an array ofcolours in the form of colour codes. A colour fastness test were conducted on these coloured scales using test methods such as rubbing test, daylight test and soaking in sulphuric acid. Apart from the above discoveries, the researcher was also able to find other valuable information to be shared with. They include the size, shape, thickness and texture of the scales which were different for all the four types of fish. The resilient characteristic of the scales made it difficult to tear or crushed. However, the colour absorption on these fish scales is being influenced by its thickness. As for the recommendation, this research can be used as reference for producing wider range of handicraft products and products in form ofjewelleries or sequins. The colours can further be experimented using natural dye on other types of salt water or fresh water fish. Batik decoration techniques can be applied on a bigger size fish scales...|$|E
