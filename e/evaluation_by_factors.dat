40|$|This paper {{describes}} how fitness inheritance {{can be used}} to estimate fitness for a proportion of newly sampled candidate solutions in the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA). The goal of estimating fitness for some candidate solutions is {{to reduce the number of}} fitness evaluations for problems where fitness evaluation is expensive. Bayesian networks used in BOA to model promising solutions and generate the new ones are extended to allow not only for modeling and sampling candidate solutions, but also for estimating their fitness. The results indicate that fitness inheritance is a promising concept in BOA, because population-sizing requirements for building appropriate models of promising solutions lead to good fitness estimates even if only a small proportion of candidate solutions is evaluated using the actual fitness function. This can lead to a reduction of the number of actual fitness <b>evaluations</b> <b>by</b> a <b>factor</b> of 30 or more. ...|$|R

Dynamic Continuous Indexing (DCI) offers a promising way of circumventing the curse and successfully reduces the dependence of query time on intrinsic dimensionality from exponential to sublinear. In this paper, we propose a variant of DCI, which we call Prioritized DCI, and show a remarkable improvement in the dependence of query time on intrinsic dimensionality. In particular, a linear increase in intrinsic dimensionality, or equivalently, an exponential {{increase in the number}} of points near a query, can be mostly counteracted with just a linear increase in space. We also demonstrate empirically that Prioritized DCI significantly outperforms prior methods. In particular, relative to Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH), Prioritized DCI reduces the number of distance <b>evaluations</b> <b>by</b> a <b>factor</b> of 14 to 116 and the memory consumption <b>by</b> a <b>factor</b> of 21.

40|$|This {{research}} paper presents guidelines for evaluation {{and design of}} natural ventilation for suburban houses in Thailand which {{is a part of}} building energy code development for residential buildings. The initial studies find that it is possible for natural ventilation to achieve thermal comfort conditions in place of mechanical air-conditioning systems, especially in winter. The experimental research is divided into two parts: environmental arrangement and building opening. By measuring air conditions flowing through different generic types of environment, it is found that the best environment is that covered with large trees. Computational fluid dynamics studies on generic houses discover that cross ventilation is more effective than two-side ventilation, and is much more effective than one-side ventilation. In general, increasing the size of openings improves the effectiveness of natural ventilation. However, the optimum effective opening area in rectangular rooms is found to be 20 percent of functional floor area.

It only evaluates error function that {{is reduced to}} a set of sub-problems in a constrained search space and the search directions follow rectilinear moves.

The constrained interpolation search decides the best learning rates such that the direction of search is not deceived in locating the minimum trajectory of the error function. The proposed algorithm is practical when the error function is ill conditioned implying that the Hessian matrix property is unstable, or the derivative evaluation is difficult.

The proposed algorithm improves over the standard first order back propagation training method in function <b>evaluations</b> <b>by</b> a <b>factor</b> of 32.

40|$|We {{revisit the}} problem of exact CMB {{likelihood}} and power spectrum estimation {{with the goal of}} minimizing computational cost through linear compression. This idea was originally proposed for CMB purposes by Tegmark et al. (1997), and here we develop it into a fully working computational framework for large-scale polarization analysis, adopting as a worked example. We compare five different linear bases (pixel space, harmonic space, noise covariance eigenvectors, signal-to-noise covariance eigenvectors and signal-plus-noise covariance eigenvectors) in terms of compression efficiency, and find that the computationally most efficient basis is the signal-to-noise eigenvector basis, which is closely related to the Karhunen-Loeve and Principal Component transforms, in agreement with previous suggestions. For this basis, the information in 6836 unmasked sky map pixels can be compressed into a smaller set of 3102 modes, with a maximum error increase of any single multipole of 3. 8 % at ℓ< 32, and a maximum shift in the mean values of a joint distribution of an amplitude [...] tilt model of 0. 006 σ. This compression reduces the computational cost of a single likelihood <b>evaluation</b> <b>by</b> a <b>factor</b> of 5, from 38 to 7. 5 CPU seconds, and it also results in a more robust likelihood by implicitly regularizing nearly degenerate modes. Finally, we use the same compression framework to formulate a numerically stable and computationally efficient variation of the Quadratic Maximum Likelihood implementation that requires less than 3 GB of memory and 2 CPU minutes per iteration for ℓ< 32, rendering low-ℓ QML CMB power spectrum analysis fully tractable on a standard laptop.

Depending on the relationship between hierarchies and AHP's requirement, 20 evaluation indictors were chosen as the secondary hierarchy. 為因應國內生態旅遊之蓬勃發展，及考量台灣森林地區自然資源體系之本土特性，本研究乃嘗試建立一「森林生態旅遊地之評估模式」，期能藉由森林地區應用生態旅遊活動之探討，而提供未來國內各自然旅遊地推展生態旅遊之模式應用。 研究中利用階層分析程序法(AHP) ，建構包括評估因子與評估指標之二層級模式架構。首先由文獻分析彙整中、與專家定量之頻度分析，篩選出 31 項相關於生態旅遊地之評估因子，再利用因素分析獲得層級一，六大類評估因子。依據層級一上下從屬之關係，並考量AHP不大於九個數目之要求，篩檢出 20 項元素以為第二層級之評估指標，由此獲得整體層級體系之建立。依據本研究之資料分析與結果討論，可得下列結論：本研究所建立之「森林生態旅遊地評估模式」主要包括六大類評估因子，即經營體制、實質環境機制、自然資源潛力、人文資源潛力、基礎性設施與旅遊效益等，及其各下屬之 20 項評估指標...|$|R
