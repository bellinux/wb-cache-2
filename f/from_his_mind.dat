5|$|Puranas are {{the first}} scriptures to speak about her birth. They declare that sage Kashyapa is her father, not Shiva as {{described}} in the Mangalkavyas. Once, when serpents and reptiles had created chaos on the Earth, sage Kashyapa created goddess Manasa <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> (mana). The creator god Brahma made her the presiding deity of snakes and reptiles. Manasa gained control over the earth, by the power of mantras she chanted. Manasa then propitiated the god, Shiva, who told her to please Krishna. Upon being pleased, Krishna granted her divine Siddhi powers and ritually worshiped her, making her an established goddess.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the Smallville {{series was}} {{continued}} through the comic book medium with Smallville: Season 11. Written by Bryan Q. Miller, who also wrote for the television series, the first issues features Chloe Sullivan referencing that each team member has established an info hub on their own territory, with communication systems linked to the Watchtower. In the second issue, Lex Luthor discovers that Queen Industries is building a facility {{on the far side}} of Earth's moon as a base for the Justice League, and its construction is under John Jones' supervision. Despite having died after her encounter with Lex Luthor, the League's liaison is Tess Mercer, whose consciousness is revealed to be bonded to her half-brother's mind. Luthor sees this as an opportunity to learn the heroes' secrets before removing Tess <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> and creates measures to prevent them from finding out his situations with Tess. Despite his efforts, Tess still manage to send her message to the League of her predicaments with Lex, and they extract her consciousness from him and uploaded it to the Watchtower computer system as a temporary home for her mind.|$|E
5|$|The Kalika Purana narrates the {{following}} tale about Rati's birth. After {{the creation of}} the 10 Prajapatis, Brahma – the creator-god – creates Kama (Kamadeva), the god of love, <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> Kama is ordered to spread love in the world by shooting his flower-arrows and Prajapati Daksha is requested to present a wife to Kama. Kama first uses his arrows against Brahma and the Prajapatis, who are all incestuously attracted to Brahma's daughter Sandhya ("Twilight-dawn/dusk"). Shiva, who was passing by, watches them and laughs. Embarrassed, Brahma and the Prajapatis tremble and perspire. From the sweat of Daksha rises a beautiful woman named Rati, who Daksha presents to Kama as his wife. At the same time, the agitated Brahma curses Kama to be burnt to ashes by Shiva in the future. However, on Kama's pleading, Brahma assures him that he would be reborn. The Brahma Vaivarta Purana narrates that Sandhya committed suicide, after Brahma lusts for her. God Vishnu resurrects her and names her Rati, and marries her to Kama. The Shiva Purana mentions that after her suicide Sandhya is reborn from the sweat of Daksha as Rati. In some texts, the god Shiva is described as the father of Rati.|$|E

During the walking tour Coleridge also encountered an old flame, Mary Evans, and his interaction with her momentarily drove thoughts of Pantisocracy <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> On August 3, Coleridge and Hucks rejoined Southey in Bristol.|$|E

25|$|There is {{considerable}} myth surrounding {{the origins of}} Somananda. He claimed he was a descendent of the sage Durvasa. Durvasa received from Shiva the spiritual mission of keeping the tradition and secrets of Agamic Shaivism alive. It is said that Durvasa created his son, Tryambaka, directly from the mind (in a similar way {{with the creation of}} Athena directly from the mind of her father, Zeus, in the Greek mythology). In turn, Tryambaka also created a son directly <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> This went on for 15 generation terminating with the father of Sangamaditya, who took a woman as a wife. Then, there were three more generations until Somananda. So, Somananda claims a divine spiritual ancestry and investiture.|$|E
25|$|Hawkins {{had told}} me aboard the ship that he would put his platoon of men up against any company of {{soldiers}} on earth and guarantee to win. He was slightly wounded by shrapnel as he came ashore in the first wave, but the furthest thing <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> was to be evacuated. He led his platoon into the forest of coconut palms. During {{a day and a}} half he personally cleaned out six Jap machine gun nests, sometimes standing on top of a track and firing point blank at four or five men who fired back at him from behind blockhouses. Lieutenant Hawkins was wounded a second time, but he still refused to retire. To say that his conduct was worthy of the highest traditions of the Marine Corps is like saying the Empire State Building is moderately high.|$|E

Likewise Sergeant Buckland testified that he had first heard of the massacres on 19 June. When asked who told him he replied that it was common knowledge around Wyndham but when pressed stated that Gribble had told him however, {{there is no evidence}} Gribble saw Buckland before 30 July, coincidentally, 19 June was the day Murnane returned and spoke to Buckland which resulted in Buckland ordering the patrol to return to Wyndham, an action that was never explained.|$|E

500|$|After leaving MacEwan University in Edmonton at 20, Powter {{moved to}} Vancouver, British Columbia {{where he played}} {{keyboards}} before he started composing songs.

For two weeks, Powter had a melody that [...] "wouldn't go away" [...] <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> Thinking of a lyric that would fit the melody, he thought an [...] "up and poppy" [...] lyric would make it [...] "the cheesiest song of all time". He then thought [...] "bad day" [...] {{would be a good}} choice for the chorus, and wrote the lyrics partly based on his life as [...] "a struggling musician". It was the last song to be composed for his album, with Powter writing it in an hour during a ferry journey between Victoria and Vancouver. Powter said it was not a lyrically elaborate song, but that: [...] "mostly it's about phonics. It's about words that sing great. I was mumbling something, and those words came out." ...|$|E

He solemnly tells them how both the Holy Spear, which pierced the side of the Redeemer on the Cross, and the Holy Grail, which caught the flowing blood, had come to Monsalvat to be guarded by the Knights of the Grail under the rule of Titurel, father of Amfortas. Klingsor had yearned to join the Knights but, unable to keep impure thoughts <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> resorted to self-castration, causing him to be expelled from the Order. Klingsor then set himself up in opposition to the realm of the Grail, learning dark arts, claiming the valley domain below and filling it with beautiful Flowermaidens to seduce and enthrall wayward Grail Knights. It was here that Amfortas lost the Holy Spear, kept by Klingsor as he schemes to get hold of the Grail as well. Gurnemanz tells how Amfortas later had a holy vision which told him to wait for a [...] "pure fool, enlightened by compassion" [...] ("") who will finally heal the wound.|$|E

500|$|According to {{the origin}} story of The Urantia Book, {{sometime}} between 1906 and 1911, a woman consulted Sadler about her husband's deep sleeping, prompting Sadler to observe {{him while he}} slept. He noticed that the sleeping man made unusual movements; the man then purportedly spoke to Sadler in an unusual voice and {{claimed to be a}} [...] "visitor ... from another planet". Observers related that the man later claimed to carry messages from several celestial beings. Sadler suspected that the man's words were drawn <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> and sought a scientific explanation for the phenomenon. Although he examined the man for psychiatric problems, he was unable to make a satisfactory diagnosis. Sadler and five others subsequently visited the man on a regular basis, speaking with him as he slept. In 1925, a large handwritten document was discovered in the patient's house; papers were said to appear in the house for years afterwards. Sadler brought the papers to his house and did not allow anyone to take them away, although some were allowed to read them on site. Sadler presumed that the documents were the product of automatic handwriting from the man's subconscious, but changed his mind after further analysis. He made no public statements about their authenticity for years.|$|E
