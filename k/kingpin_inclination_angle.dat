In {{order to}} study the {{performance}} of Hiper Strut suspension and find out the factors which affect its performance, a simulation model of Hiper Strut suspension was established based on Adams/Car and a kinematics optimization was carried out based on Adams/Insight. The result shows that both of its caster angle and <b>kingpin</b> <b>inclination</b> <b>angle</b> change only a little during the parallel wheel travel simulation test. After modifying the coordinate values of some hard points which were found out by using Adams/Insight, the suspension gets a better performance. The established model and optimization could be a foundation for further study of this new suspension...|$|E
40|$|The front double {{wishbone}} suspension parameters are related as a multi-body model. By replacing the new suspension and steering hard points, {{the performance of}} the suspension system is studied using CATIA and MSC ADAMS software for modeling and analyzing, respectively. In this case two tests were done, steady state circular test in ADAMS/View and parallel wheel travel in ADAMS/Car. The strut position is directly related to <b>Kingpin</b> <b>inclination</b> <b>angle</b> and scrub radius. The increase the amount of these two parameters has an effect on steering performance in low speed and negative displacement, such as camber, caster and Kingpin inclination angles in negative displacement of wheels. Moreover, the same tests in rear {{double wishbone}} suspension show that the growth has no effect on camber, caster and Kingpin inclination angles. So, the major effect of this geometry is on the front independent suspension. In this project, the details were selected on electric vehicle (EV) for kinematics analysis...|$|E
40|$|A leaf <b>inclination</b> <b>angle</b> {{distribution}} model, {{which is}} applicable to simulate leaf <b>inclination</b> <b>angle</b> distribution in six heights of layered canopy at different growth stages, {{was established by}} component factors affecting plant type in rice. The accuracy of the simulation results was validated by measured values from a field experiment. The coefficient of determination (R 2) and the {{root mean square error}} (RMSE) between the simulated and measured values were 0. 9472 and 3. 93 %, respectively. The simulation results showed that the distribution of leaf <b>inclination</b> <b>angles</b> differed among the three plant types. The leaf <b>inclination</b> <b>angles</b> were larger in the compact variety Liangyoupeijiu with erect leaves than in the loose variety Shanyou 63 with droopy leaves and the intermediate variety Liangyou Y 06. The leaf <b>inclination</b> <b>angles</b> were distributed in the lower range in Shanyou 63, which matched up with field measurements. The distribution of leaf <b>inclination</b> <b>angles</b> in the same variety changed throughout the seven growth stages. The leaf <b>inclination</b> <b>angles</b> enlarged gradually from transplanting to booting. During the post-booting period, the leaf <b>inclination</b> <b>angle</b> increased in Shanyou 63 and Liangyou Y 06, but changed little in Liangyoupeijiu. At every growth stage of each variety, canopy leaf <b>inclination</b> <b>angle</b> distribution on the six heights of canopy layers was variable. As canopy height increased, the layered leaf area index (LAI) decreased in all the three plant types. However, while the leaf <b>inclination</b> <b>angles</b> showed little change in Liangyoupeijiu, they became larger in Shanyou 63 but smaller in Liangyou Y 06. The simulation results used in the constructed model were very similar to the actual measurement values. The model provides a method for estimating canopy leaf <b>inclination</b> <b>angle</b> distribution in rice production...|$|R

In order to study the surface crack growth the stress intensity factors of the front of half-circular surface crack are calculated according to fracture analysis code- 3 D(FRANC 3 D). And the influences of <b>inclination</b> <b>angle</b> of the surface crack and the orientation angle on I，II，III mode stress intensity factors were analyzed. I mode stress intensity factor increases along the crack front with increasing <b>inclination</b> <b>angle.</b> And I mode stress intensity factor of the same <b>inclination</b> <b>angle</b> is symmetrical {{with respect to the}} orientation angle of 90 degree. II，III mode stress intensity factors are the maximum when the <b>inclination</b> <b>angle</b> is equal to 45 degree.

40|$|In this study, we {{established}} {{a method to}} calculate <b>inclination</b> <b>angle</b> of moving vehicles from acceleration and angular velocity measured by microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensor, which is becoming popular recently due to its ultra–small size and low manufacturing cost. We applied the technique to measure <b>inclination</b> <b>angle</b> of semi–crawler tractor to validate its usefulness. Results from various methods to calculate <b>inclination</b> <b>angle</b> of a vehicle from acceleration and angular velocity data showed that moving average acceleration method and wavelet acceleration method produced results that significantly deviated from the actual <b>inclination</b> <b>angle,</b> while results from angular velocity method and acceleration–angular velocity method were close to the actual <b>inclination</b> <b>angle.</b> <b>Inclination</b> <b>angle</b> calculated by acceleration method in a static state was {{very similar to the}} measurement from inclination sensor and was highly accurate, but did not demonstrate sufficient accuracy in dynamic state as the estimated <b>inclination</b> <b>angle</b> was at maximum 10 ˚ smaller at <b>inclination</b> <b>angle</b> of 75 ˚. In the meanwhile, the <b>inclination</b> <b>angle</b> calculated by angular velocity method showed only small deviation from the sensor measurement even at dynamic state. As a result of measuring inclination of semi–crawler type tractor using MEMS sensor, it was determined that the angular velocity method is the most versatile of the four methods tested as it can not only produce very accurate time series of <b>inclination</b> <b>angle</b> but also be used to easily obtain angular displacement from the angular velocity data obtained. However, error of integration was shown to increase with longer measurement times and it must be addressed by an appropriate solution. Acceleration–angular velocity method also produced similar results as experiments were performed indoors where disturbance factors were few. The <b>inclination</b> <b>angle</b> measurement system using MEMS sensor established in this study can be applied to agricultural vehicles such as tractors as well as to almost all construction and general vehicles with drive system. We expect the system to contribute to development of a safety system that can prevent rollover accidents and quickly respond to them...|$|R

A phenomenon exist below 2° such that for a given set of operating conditions, decreasing the <b>inclination</b> <b>angle</b> will increase the bed depth resulting in a lower screening efficiency. However it will also simultaneously increase the residence time, which results in an increase in the screening efficiency.

40|$|We {{study size}} {{segregation}} of binary granular mixtures flowing over an inclined plane using DEM simulations. We critically examine the recently proposed scaling {{of the species}} percolation velocity with the local shear rate for different <b>inclination</b> <b>angles</b> and size ratios for an equal volume mixture of large and small spherical particles. Our DEM simulations explore a much wider range of <b>inclination</b> <b>angles</b> and shear rates for three different size ratios of large and small particles. Our results suggest that while the scaling of percolation velocity with the shear rate seems to work well for any given <b>inclination</b> <b>angle,</b> this scaling is unable to capture the influence of <b>inclination</b> <b>angle</b> on the segregation. We overcome this limitation and propose a more appropriate way of scaling the percolation velocity.

40|$|Simulations of {{three-dimensional}} laminar {{forced convection}} adjacent to inclined backward-facing step in rectangular duct are presented to examine effects of step inclination on flow and heat transfer distributions. The step height is maintained as constant while its <b>inclination</b> <b>angle</b> is changed from 15 ° to 90 °. The inlet flow is hydrodynamically steady and fully developed with uniform temperature. The bottom wall is heated with constant heat flux, while other walls are maintained as being thermally adiabatic. Velocity, temperature, Nusselt number, and friction coefficient distributions are presented. The “jet-like” flow and its impingement {{do not appear}} as the <b>inclination</b> <b>angle</b> of backward-facing step is small (α = 15 °). At the center width of the duct {{and close to the}} stepped wall, the location where the streamwise velocity component is zero changes from a saddle point to a nodal point as the step <b>inclination</b> <b>angle</b> decreases. The downwash adjacent to the sidewall becomes stronger as the step <b>inclination</b> <b>angle</b> increases. The maximum Nusselt number on the stepped wall is located near the sidewall for α ⩾ 30 ° and it appears near the center width of duct for small step <b>inclination</b> <b>angle</b> (α = 15 °).

40|$|We {{calculated}} bolometric {{images of}} relativistic slim disks during a radiation-pressure-driven thermal instability. When the mass-accretion rate exceeds the critical one, an inner {{region of the}} standard accretion disk bursts to change to a slim disk state having a large scale height.

40|$|For {{animals that}} migrate long distances, the {{magnetic}} field of the earth provides not only a possible cue for compass orientation, but a potential source of world-wide positional information. At each location on the globe, the geomagnetic field lines intersect the earth’s surface at a specific <b>angle</b> of <b>inclination.</b> Because <b>inclination</b> <b>angles</b> vary with latitude, an animal able to distinguish between different field inclinations might, in principle, determine its approximate latitude. Such an ability, however, has never been demonstrated in any animal. We studied the magnetic orientation behavior of hatchling loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta L.) exposed to earth-strength magnetic fields of different inclinations. Hatchlings exposed to the natural field of their natal beach swam eastward, as they normally do during their offshore migration. In contrast, those subjected to an <b>inclination</b> <b>angle</b> found on the northern boundary of the North Atlantic gyre (their presumed migratory path) swam south-southwest.
