40|$|Four {{individual}} quadruplexes, {{which are}} self-assembled in ammonium acetate solution from telomeric sequences of closely related DNA strands—d(G 4 T 4 <b>G</b> 4), <b>d(G</b> 3 T 4 <b>G</b> 4), <b>d(G</b> 3 T 4 <b>G</b> 3), and <b>d(G</b> 4 T 4 G 3) —have been {{detected in the}} gas phase using electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FTICR-MS). The bimolecular quadruplexes associate with {{the same number of}} NH 4 + in the gas phase as NMR shows that they do in solution.

Furthermore, the mass spectra show that the bimolecular quadruplexes generated by the strands d(G 3 T 4 <b>G</b> 3) and <b>d(G</b> 4 T 4 G 3) are unstable, being converted into trimolecular and tetramolecular structures with increasing concentrations of NH 4 + in the solution. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra reveal structural changes during the process of strand stoichiometric transitions, in which the relative orientation of strands in the quadruplexes changes from an antiparallel to a parallel arrangement. Such changes were observed for the strand d(G 4 T 4 G 3), but not for the strand d(G 3 T 4 G 3).

We have investigated the importance of the loop interactions by systematically replacing each thymine in the loop with a cytosine. The quadruplexes formed by d(G 3 CT 3 <b>G</b> 3), <b>d(G</b> 3 TCT 2 <b>G</b> 3), <b>d(G</b> 3 T 2 CTG 3) and d(G 3 T 3 CG 3) in the presence of 150 mM Na+ were studied by gel mobility, circular dichroism and 1 H NMR spectroscopy.

The linear four-stranded quadruplex has a greater tendency to oligomerize to larger ill-defined structures, as demonstrated by broad 1 H NMR resonances. At pH 4, when the cytosine is protonated, there is a greater tendency for each of the oligonucleotides to form some four-stranded linear quadruplex, except for d(G 3 T 2 CTG 3), which has the reverse tendency.

First, we compare analytical bounds for the continuous and discrete version of the PDEs. Whilst traditional $L^ 2 $ norm energy bounds applied to the discrete PDE do not always predict the physical behaviour of the continuous version of the equation, more strict elliptic norm bounds correctly bound the behaviour of the continuous PDE. Having derived consistent bounds, we analyse the effectiveness of two stabilising techniques: over-integration and split form variations (conservative, non-conservative and skew-symmetric). Whilst the former is shown to not alleviate aliasing in general, the latter ensures an aliasing-free solution if the splitting form of the discrete PDE {{is consistent with the}} continuous equation. The success of split form de-aliasing is restricted to DG schemes with the summation-by-parts simultaneous-approximation-term (SBP-SAT) properties (e. <b>g.</b> <b>DG</b> with Gauss-Lobatto points).
