40|$|Many couples live {{a portion}} of their lives being {{separated}} from each other as part of a long-distance relationship (LDR). This includes a large number of dating college students as well as couples who are geographicallyseparated because of situational demands such as work. We conducted interviews with individuals in LDRs to understand how they make use of video chat systems to maintain their relationships. In particular, we have investigated how couples use video to “hang out ” together and engage in activities over extended periods of time. Our results show that regardless of the relationship situation, video affords a unique opportunity for couples to share presence over distance, which in turn provides intimacy and reduced idealization. While beneficial, couples still face challenges in using video, including contextual (e. g., location of partners, time zone differences), technical (e. g., mobility, audio and video quality, networking), and personal (e. g., a lack of true physicality needed by most <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to support <b>intimate</b> sexual acts) challenges.

40|$|A block {{copolymer}} may be added as a compatibilizer during polymer processing <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to promote <b>intimate</b> mixing of thermodynamically immiscible homopolymers. The action of this compatibilizer can only partially {{be attributed to}} {{its effect on the}} interfacial tension between the immiscible homopolymers. Here the additional contributions of the compatibilizer are directly probed by measuring the capillary number during coalescence experiments. Model blends consisting of polyisobutylene (PIB) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), compatibilized with various amounts of a PLB-PDMS di{{block copolymer}}, are used for this purpose. The mean capillary number of the droplets is determined from the mechanical frequency response of the blends. With increasing amounts of compatibilizer, a systematic increase in steady shear capillary number is seen, to values well above the critical capillary number for droplet breakup of uncompatibilized systems. This indicates that a simple decrease in interfacial tension is not the only effect of adding the compatibilizer to these immiscible blends. Past simulations suggest that these results are associated with gradients in interfacial tension (Marangoni stresses) induced by the gradients of compatibilizer concentration due to flow. Direct evidence of the presence of such interfacial tension gradients along the surface of compatibilized drops was obtained by optical microscopy.

However, the interfacial resistance arising from poor interfacial compatibility and loose contact seriously hinders the electrochemical performances of all-solid-state lithium batteries.

40|$|Young {{women in}} age-asymmetric {{relationships}} {{may be at}} an elevated risk for acquisition of HIV, since relationships with older men are also correlated with other risk behaviors like less condom use. Qualitative {{studies have shown that}} women are motivated to participate in these relationships for money and emotional support. However, there is a paucity of research on women's perceived risks of these relationships, particularly in South Africa. To this end, we conducted in-depth interviews with 23 women recruited from three urban communities in Cape Town. A thematic question guide was used to direct the interviews. Thematic content analysis was used to explore women's perceived risks of age-disparate and non-age-disparate relationships, the benefits of dating older men, and risk perceptions that influence decisions around beginning or ending a relationship. A plurality of women thought that dating an older man does not bring any adverse consequences, although some thought that older men do not use condoms and may be involved in concurrent partnerships. Many women were less inclined to date same-age or younger men, because they were viewed as being disrespectful and abusive. This study points to the need for more awareness raising about the risks of age-disparate relationships. In addition to these initiatives, there is an urgent need to implement holistic approaches to relationship health, <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to curb <b>intimate</b> partner violence, improve gender equity and make non-age-disparate relationships more attractive...|$|R

The peak of emotional state {{is not the only one}} factor that had influenced the process of decision making. The influential factors of the process are internal factors and external factors. The main purposes of this research are to understand the process of decision making of wives who had done an intimate homicide, coping pattern of the decision making, and influential factors of the process to take the decision. Researcher used phenomenological approach to reveal the process of decision making of those wives deeply. Research data had been taken through unstructured interview. The result of the interview is transformed to written form <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to analyze it. Additional data had been taken from sourced triangulation and methodological triangulation. This research will try to explain the process of decision making of wives who had done an intimate homicide. There are seven meaningful units which showed similarity among the three subjects. Before they took the decision to kill their spouses, each subject had tried to hold on their conflicted marriage. The decision had been taken when the stressful situation can not be tolerated. Coping pattern of the decision making of the three subjects consist of two general patterns, that are hypervigilance and vigilance. The result of this research shows the importance of development of internal and external factors. The development of the two factors could influence a person to take judgment carefully and avoid disadvantages that could be experienced by the persons in the conflict.

40|$|How did {{rock and}} roll, the best music for worshipping the devil, become the finest music for worshipping God? This study narrates {{the import of}} rock music into church sanctuaries across America via the rise of {{contemporary}} worship music (CWM). While white evangelicals derided rock n' roll as the "devil's music" in the 1950 s, it slowly made its way into their churches and beyond over the next fifty years, emerging as a multi-million dollar industry by the twenty-first century. This study is a cultural history of CWM, chronicling the rise of rock music in the worship life of American Christians. Pulling from several different primary and secondary sources, I argue that three main motivations fueled the rise of CWM in America: the desire to reach the lost, to commune in emotional intimacy with God, and to grow the flock. These three motivations evolved among different actors and movements at different times. In the 1970 s, the Jesus People movement anchored in Southern California, adopted {{the music of the}} counterculture to attract hippies to church. In the early 1980 s, the Vineyard Fellowship combined rock forms with lyrics that spoke of God in the second person <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to facilitate <b>intimate</b> worship with the divine. In the late 1980 s, the church growth movement embraced CWM as a tool to attract disaffected baby boomers back to church. By the 1990 s, these three motivations had begun to energize an entire industry built around the merger between rock and worship. Dissertatio...|$|R

Nonetheless, the number of nomination has been an unsolved mystery for social networkers. Namely, for each respondents, to name {{how many people are}} good enough to generate a stable network, which is able to represent the truly association structure among these respondents, still, is an empirical research question for researchers. This study devoted to explore this question and to provide a preliminary answer. A set of social network data was collected from a sample of Taipei metropolitan junior high schools, including 44 classes. In each class the students were asked to nominate ten best friends <b>in</b> the <b>intimate</b> <b>order.</b> It was supposed that in each class has ten sociometric data for different nomination, and the total amount of sociometric data was 440. The software UCINET 6. 0 was applied to analyze the social network variables, and NEGOPY 4. 30 to define the network position. Comparing the betweenness, constraint, and efficiency, this study found that two names will generate more diverse network position with unstable structure, three names are the minimum to get more stable network structure, four or five names are needed to observe the links between boys and girls, but more than five names seem to be redundancy...|$|R

40|$|Enchantment is a {{defining}} feature our postcolonial, globalised {{world and the}} literary is where much of this wonder is registered and celebrated. Thus this thesis attends to the postcolonial dynamic of sacred and secular experience as it is represented in contemporary African literatures. Debates around the secular and postsecular are long standing {{in the fields of}} religious studies, anthropology and philosophy, but as yet underappreciated in literary studies. I develop a hermeneutic of the imminent sacred as a way to read the constitutive and recuperative gestures subjects make as they assert a sense of belonging in spaces of globalised modernity. The texts are grouped thematically. In response to Chris Abani and Yvonne Vera’s work I articulate how the ritual dimensions of lyrical prose and ritual attention to the corporeal form sacralises the body. Phaswane Mpe and Teju Cole incorporate African epistemologies into the resignification of their cities and with Ivan Vladislavić, the streets are sacralised. Marlene van Niekerk and J. M. Coetzee convey the anxieties of settler colonialism and a love of land reinscribed as sublime. Collectively, the novels I discuss reflect patterns of existential anxiety that emerge from difficulties of belonging, and I trace the ritualised and sacralising strategies of incorporation that seek to locate the subject. These novels radically disrupt the epistemological and ontological modalities of globalised ‘secular’ literary production and intervene in the recuperation of the sacred as a mode of incorporation and resistance. Recent scholarship in African literatures has overlooked these distinctly postsecular negotiations {{and the ways in which}} the sacred is reinvested in contemporary African fiction <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to instantiate <b>intimate,</b> local alternatives to the teleology of secular modernity. Thus I use the imminent sacred as a reading strategy that foregrounds these postsecular negotiations and the interrelations of care and vulnerability that motivate sacralisation...|$|R
40|$|An area {{attracting}} {{increased attention}} from the ‘profit driven’ commercial drug industry is the potentially lucrative medication market for female sexual problems. In {{the absence of an}} approved pharmaceutical drug, numerous internet based herbal sexual medicine (HSM) companies are targeting this market. Very little has been known about the marketing messages that HSM companies are sending out to women via the internet. 			This research delivered a critical analysis of the marketing messages of five prominent internet based HSM companies: Zestra; Femvigor; Hersolution; Vigorelle, and; Provestra. The analysis revealed three main discursive themes forming the basis of the marketing strategy. In the first theme, the HSM websites presented a medicalised view of women’s sexuality and sexual problems, this framing implicated all women as being sexually dysfunctional and requiring biologically based sexual medication. In the second theme, stereotypical gender constructions were used in the HSM websites to portray women’s sexuality as inadequate compared to men’s, whilst emphasising the importance of sex for men and the necessity for women to fulfil men’s sexual needs <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to maintain <b>intimate</b> relationships. This again led to the conclusion that women needed to consume sexual medication. In the third theme, the HSM websites capitalised on the current western societal emphasis placed on the importance of sex for health. In conjunction with the portrayal of the importance of sex was a call for women to act responsibly concerning their health. Being ‘responsible’ for sexual health, was portrayed in the HSM websites as consuming sexual medicine. 										The critical analysis of the HSM websites ultimately revealed that the marketers of HSMs had researched and identified potential issues that could make women anxious about their sexual problems. They appeared to emphasise these problematic issues in an attempt to increase a women’s anxiety about her sexual concerns, with the aim of manipulating women into purchasing sexual medication. These findings add considerable evidence to suggest that HSM companies are involved in the disease-mongering of female sexual problems...|$|R
