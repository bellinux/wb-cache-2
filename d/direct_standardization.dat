50|$|Within the {{category}} of standardization, {{there are two major}} approaches: <b>direct</b> <b>standardization</b> and indirect standardization.|$|E
50|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>standardization</b> {{is able to}} be {{used when}} the {{population}} being studied is large enough for age-specific rate is stable.|$|E
50|$|Expected deaths {{would then}} be {{calculated}} simply by multiplying the death rates {{of the general population}} {{by the total number of}} participants in the study group at the corresponding age group and summing up all the values for each age group to arrive at the number of expected deaths. The study groups are weighted based on their particular distribution (for example, age), as opposed to the general populations's distribution. This is a fundamental distinction between an indirect method of standardization like SMR from <b>direct</b> <b>standardization</b> techniques.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{technique}} for calibration transfer called the Modified Four Point Interpolant (MFPI) method is introduced for near infrared spectra.

40|$|Shifts {{in working}} {{temperature}} {{are an important}} issue that prevents the successful transfer of calibration models from one chemical instrument to another. This effect is of special relevance when working with gas sensor arrays modulated in temperature. In this paper, we study the use of multivariate techniques to transfer the calibration model from a temperature modulated gas sensor array to another when a global change of temperature occurs. To do so, we built 12 identical master sensor arrays composed of three different types of commercial Figaro sensors and acquired a dataset of sensor responses to three pure substances (ethanol, acetone and butanone) dosed at 7 concentrations. The master arrays are then shifted in temperature (from − 50 to 50 °C, ΔT = 10 °C) and considered as slave arrays. Data correction is performed for {{an increasing number of}} transfer samples with 4 different calibration transfer techniques: <b>Direct</b> <b>Standardization,</b> Piece-wise <b>Direct</b> <b>Standardization,</b> Orthogonal Signal Correction and Generalized Least Squares Weighting. In order to evaluate the performance of the calibration transfer, we compare the Root Mean Square Error of Prediction (RMSEP) of master and slave arrays, for each instrument correction.

The goal {{of this study was}} to estimate caries experiences in a population of children aged 5 and 11 years, in the presence of non response and missing data. Four estimation methods are compared. Each method makes implicit assumptions about the processes that caused the nonresponse and the missing data. Three of the four methods are based on unrealistic assumptions about the missing data and underestimate caries experience.

Our results show that a decentralized approach based on mutual adjustment can be more flexible and give better results than a centralized approach using direct supervision. Also, we have obtained results showing that a standardization rule like the partitioning of the map {{can be helpful in}} those kind of environments. ...|$|R

40|$|Coordination, and {{the lack}} of it, is {{frequently}} ascribed as a key role in successful and less successful building processes. Over the last four decades, the understanding of coordination has shifted from emphasizing formal structures to emphasizing informal mechanisms. A review of four articles shows this development as well as how the formal and informal structures and mechanisms relate. The review is done from a perspective of a large design-build project in Denmark. The review indicates, that formal and informal coordination mechanisms alone are not sufficient to explain coordination in practice. The main coordination mechanisms discussed are mutual adjustment, <b>direct</b> supervision, <b>standardization,</b> relational coordination, adaptive capacity, and IT as a tool to accomplish task and impose a chronological rhythm and schedule on the work processes. From this point of departure a new set of coordination mechanisms for practice is developed rooted in current institutional theory. The mechanisms are internal building of an institution and external building of relationships between a number of institutions. The conclusion is that existing literature on coordination does not fully describe the complexity of coordination in an institutionalised design-build organisation and that a new set of coordination mechanisms rooted in institutional theory contributes to our understanding of complex coordination...|$|R

We invited ten specialists of disaster medicine to establish an examination database for certification. Fifty questions were randomly selected as the final test of certification within the following four months. Totally 517 students joined in the examination of certification.

40|$|Direct and {{indirect}} standardization procedures aim at comparing differences in health or differences {{in health care}} expenditures between subgroups of the population after controlling for observable morbidity differences. There is a close analogy between this problem {{and the issue of}} risk adjustment in health insurance. We analyse this analogy within the theoretical framework proposed in the recent social choice literature on responsibility and compensation. Traditional methods of risk adjustment are analogous to indirect standardization. They are equivalent to the so-called conditional egalitarian mechanism in social choice. In general, they do not remove incentives for risk selection, even if the effect of non-morbidity variables is correctly taken into account. A method of risk adjustment based on <b>direct</b> <b>standardization</b> (as proposed for Ireland) does remove the incentives for risk selection, but at the cost of violating a neutrality condition, stating that insurers should receive the same premium subsidy for all members of the same risk group. <b>Direct</b> <b>standardization</b> is equivalent to the egalitarianequivalent (or proportional) mechanism in social choice. The conflict between removing incentives for risk selection and neutrality is unavoidable if the health expenditure function is not additively separable in the morbidity and efficiency variables. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{hospital}} standardized mortality ratio (HSMR) {{is developed}} {{to evaluate and}} improve hospital quality. Different methods {{can be used to}} standardize the hospital mortality ratio. Our aim was to assess the validity and applicability of directly and indirectly standardized hospital mortality ratios. Methods: Retrospective scenario analysis using routinely collected hospital data to compare deaths predicted by the indirectly standardized case-mix adjustment method with observed deaths. Discharges from Dutch hospitals in the period 2003 – 2009 were used to estimate the underlying prediction models. We analysed variation in indirectly standardized hospital mortality ratios (HSMRs) when changing the case-mix distributions using different scenarios. Sixty-one Dutch hospitals were included in our scenario analysis. Results: A numerical example showed that when interaction between hospital and case-mix is present and case-mix differs between hospitals, indirectly standardized HSMRs vary between hospitals providing the same quality of care. In empirical data analysis, the differences between directly and indirectly standardized HSMRs for individual hospitals were limited. Conclusion: <b>Direct</b> <b>standardization</b> is not affected by the presence of interaction between hospital and case-mix and is therefore theoretically preferable over indirect standardization.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to identify the processes and devices used by special education administrators to coordinate the work of principals in implementing programs for handicapped students. Based on literature of organizational structures and of school district administration, interview protocols were developed to elicit information about the use of coordinating mechanisms in schools. Data was gathered through field interviews with a stratified sample of ten special education directors and twenty-one principals in ten school districts in Arizona. The data were subjected to two iterations of analysis: computer assisted analysis yielding frequency distributions, percentages, and cross tabulations, and descriptive analysis. Four coordinating mechanisms were found to be used by directors in working with principals: commitment to common goals, <b>direct</b> supervision, <b>standardization</b> of processes, and mutual adjustment. The use of coordinating mechanisms varied in relation to school level, structural complexity, and environmental stability and complexity. The major mode of coordination was mutual adjustment, with both directors and principals relying on direct contact more than any other device for information sharing, decision making, and conflict resolution. The study revealed a surprising level of conflict surrounding the implementation of handicapped programs.

This review therefore sought to use comparative analysis to determine the activities implemented, service delivery models as well as the barriers and facilitators of TB/HIV integration in SSA.

Eight articles were identified based on different TB/HIV integration programmes across SSA. TB/HIV implemented interventions were HIV screening for TB patients, co-trimoxazole preventive therapy and antiretroviral therapy for eligible HIV positive patients. Three main service delivery models with varying levels of integration were identified: referral, partial integration and full integration model.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{transfer}} a calibration model, {{techniques such as}} piecewise <b>direct</b> <b>standardization</b> (PDS) or <b>direct</b> <b>standardization</b> (DS) are used. This implies that the same subset of samples must be measured in both situations. However, when a model is transferred from an off-line application to an on-line application, {{it is not possible}} to remeasure the same subset of samples. In this paper, however, a method is presented which can transfer a multivariate calibration model from an off-line application to an on-line application without remeasuring the same subset. For this purpose a calibration model has been calculated with a subset of spectral variables. The variables, which are sensitive to the differences between the off-line and the on-line application, are rejected. The method is compared with the calculation of a hybrid calibration model in which off-line and on-line spectral data are combined into one calibration set. The methods are applied to a calibration model which is used to predict the shrinkage after heat treatment of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) yarns from the Raman spectra measured both off-line and on-line. The Raman spectra of a calibration set have been measured off-line and a smaller set has been measured on-line during the production of PET yarns.
