Some other cameras have a separate GPS receiver that fits into the flash connector or <b>hot</b> <b>shoe.</b> Recorded GPS data can also be added to any digital photograph on a computer, either by correlating the time stamps of the photographs with a GPS record from a hand-held GPS receiver or manually by using a map or mapping software. The process of adding geographic information to a photograph is known as geotagging. Photo-sharing communities like Panoramio, locr or Flickr equally allow their users to upload geocoded pictures or to add geolocation information online.|$|E

The first camera {{with any kind of}} <b>hot</b> <b>shoe</b> connector was the Univex Mercury (USA) non-SLR half frame 35 mm in 1938 and many post World War 2 non-SLRs (such as the Bell & Howell Foton USA 35 mm rangefinder) had a Leica-type accessory shoe with added electrical contact (the present day ISO <b>hot</b> <b>shoe).</b> Although the Nikon F (see above) had a non-ISO <b>hot</b> <b>shoe</b> surrounding the film rewind crank in 1959, most 1960s 35 mm SLRs used screw-on accessory shoes attached to the eyepiece to mount flashes but a PC cable socket to sync them. The ISO <b>hot</b> <b>shoe</b> became a standard SLR feature in the early 1970s. However, in 1971, SLRs using [...] "dedicated" [...] electronic flashes with automatic flash exposure control began appearing with the Canon FTb (Japan). They used ISO-style shoes with extra electrical contacts. Each SLR brand used incompatible contact configurations and the time of use-any-flash-with-any-SLR passed by the late 1970s.

25|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>shoes</b> {{are placed}} in water to cool them off. The farrier then nails the shoes on, by driving the nails into the hoof wall at the white line of the hoof. The nails are shaped {{in such a way}} that they bend outward as they are driven in, {{avoiding}} the sensitive inner part of the foot, so they emerge on the sides of the hoof. When the nail has been completely driven, the farrier cuts off the sharp points and uses a clincher (a form of tongs made especially for this purpose) or a clinching block with hammer to bend the rest of the nail so it is almost flush with the hoof wall. This prevents the nail from getting caught on anything, and also helps to hold the nail, and therefore the shoe, in place.|$|R

40|$|Analytic {{optimization}} of a thermoelectric junction often introduces several simplifying assumptionsincluding constant material properties, fixed known <b>hot</b> {{and cold}} <b>shoe</b> temperatures, and thermallyinsulated leg sides. In fact {{all of these}} simplifications will {{have an effect on}} device performance,ranging from negligible to significant depending on conditions. Numerical methods, such as FiniteElement Analysis or iterative techniques, are often used to perform more detailed analysis andaccount for these simplifications. While numerical methods may stand as a suitable solution scheme,they are weak in gaining physical understanding and only serve to optimize through iterativesearching techniques. Analytic and asymptotic expansion techniques can be used to solve thegoverning system of thermoelectric differential equations with fewer or less severe assumptionsthan the classic case. Analytic methods can provide meaningful closed form solutions and generatebetter physical understanding of the conditions for when simplifying assumptions may be valid. In obtaining the analytic solutions a set of dimensionless parameters, which characterize allthermoelectric couples, is formulated and provide the limiting cases for validating assumptions. Presentation includes optimization of both classic rectangular couples as well as practically andtheoretically interesting cylindrical couples using optimization parameters physically meaningful toa cylindrical couple. Solutions incorporate the physical behavior for i) thermal resistance of <b>hot</b> andcold <b>shoes,</b> ii) variable material properties with temperature, and iii) lateral heat transfer through legsides...|$|R

40|$|A set of {{convenient}} thermoelectric device solutions {{have been}} derived {{in order to}} capture {{a number of factors}} which are previously only resolved with numerical techniques. The concise conversion efficiency equations derived from governing equations provide intuitive and straight-forward design guidelines. These guidelines allow for better device design without requiring detailed numerical modeling. The analytical modeling accounts for factors such as i) variable temperature boundary conditions, ii) lateral heat transfer, iii) temperature variable material properties, and iv) transient operation. New dimensionless parameters, similar to the figure of merit, are introduced including the device design factor, fin factor, thermal diffusivity factor, and inductance factor. These new device factors allow for the straight-forward description of phenomenon generally only captured with numerical work otherwise. As an example a device design factor of 0. 38, which accounts for thermal resistance of the <b>hot</b> and cold <b>shoes,</b> can be used to calculate a conversion efficiency of 2. 28 while the ideal conversion efficiency based on figure of merit alone would be 6. 15.
