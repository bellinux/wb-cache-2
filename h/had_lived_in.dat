5|$|Although Clinch {{believed}} that the evidence pointed to the twins having genuinely existed but that they <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the 16th century, rather than the early 12th century as generally claimed, they are not mentioned in any journals or books from the period. This points against their having lived in the 16th century; the case of Lazarus and Joannes Baptista Colloredo (1617– after1646) had prompted great interest in conjoined twins, and conjoined sisters surviving to adulthood in south east England would have been widely noted.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{not fully}} {{understood}} how it came to his attention, Rochdale Town Hall was admired by Adolf Hitler. It has been suggested a visit by Hitler in 1912–13 while staying with his half-brother Alois Hitler, Jr. in Liverpool, or military intelligence on Rochdale, or information from Nazi sympathiser William Joyce (who <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> Oldham), brought the building to his attention. Hitler admired the architecture {{so much that it}} is believed he wished to ship the building, brick-by-brick, to Nazi Germany had German-occupied Europe encompassed the United Kingdom.

Béla <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the Byzantine court, where Ladislaus's daughter, Irene, was venerated as a saint.|$|E
5|$|First {{elected to}} Congress in 1936, Voorhis had {{defeated}} lackluster Republican opposition {{four times in}} the then-rural Los Angeles County district to win re-election.

5|$|He {{was a close}} {{political}} ally of President John F. Kennedy, a {{fact that}} disturbed some North Carolina Democrats suspicious of Kennedy's Catholicism.

5|$|In 1895, surgeon J. W. Ballantyne {{considered}} {{the case of}} the Biddenden Maids from a teratological perspective. He suggested that they had in fact been pygopagus (twins joined at the pelvis). Pygopagus twins are known to put their arms around each other's shoulders when walking, and Ballantyne suggested that this accounted for their apparently being joined at the shoulders in drawings. The pygopagus Millie and Christine McCoy <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> Britain for a short time before going on to a successful singing career in the United States, and it was known from their case that such twins were capable of surviving to adulthood.|$|E
