5|$|In neuroscience, a {{great deal}} of effort has gone into {{investigating}} how the perceived world of conscious awareness is constructed inside the brain. The process is generally thought to involve two primary mechanisms: (1) hierarchical processing of sensory inputs, and (2) memory. Signals arising from sensory organs are transmitted to the brain and then processed in a series of stages, which extract multiple types of information from the raw input. In the visual system, for example, sensory signals from the eyes are transmitted to the thalamus and then to the primary visual cortex; inside the cerebral cortex they are sent to areas that extract features such as three-dimensional structure, shape, color, and motion. Memory comes into play in at least two ways. First, it allows sensory information to be evaluated in the context of previous experience. Second, and <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> working memory allows information to be integrated over time so that it can generate a stable representation of the world—Gerald Edelman expressed this point vividly by titling one of his books about consciousness The Remembered Present. In computational neuroscience, Bayesian approaches to brain function have been used to understand both the evaluation of sensory information in light of previous experience, and the integration of information over time. Bayesian models of the brain are probabilistic inference models, in which the brain takes advantage of prior knowledge to interpret uncertain sensory inputs in order to formulate a conscious percept; Bayesian models have successfully predicted many perceptual phenomena in vision and the nonvisual senses.|$|E

40|$|The main {{theme of}} this paper is the {{construction}} of e#cient, reliable and a#ordable error bounds for two families of quadrature methods for highly oscillatory integrals. We demonstrate, using asymptotic expansions, that the error can be bounded very precisely indeed at the cost of few extra derivative evaluations. Moreover, in place of derivatives it is possible to use finite di#erence approximations, with spacing inversely proportional to frequency. This renders the computation of error bounds <b>even</b> cheaper and, <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> leads to a new family of quadrature methods for highly oscillatory integrals that can attain arbitrarily high asymptotic order without computation of derivatives...|$|R
30|$|The {{balanced}} order ρ of a multiwavelet system {{corresponds to}} {{its ability to}} represent images sparsely [17, 18]. Recent {{studies show that the}} 2 -band MWTs based on balanced (ρ[*]=[*] 1) multiwavelets (i.e., balanced 2 -band MWT, as shown in Fig.  1) consistently outperform those based on unbalanced (ρ[*]=[*] 0) counterparts (i.e., 2 -band MWT) in image denoising [19 – 22]. Also, balanced 2 -band MWPT schemes derived by developing the balanced 2 -band MWT into “packet” versions also consistently outperform (unbalanced) 2 -band MWPT in seismic data compression and denoising [23]. However, there have been no published in-depth studies on the relationship between the balanced order ρ and sparse representation ability of balanced (ρ[*]=[*] 1) or high-order balanced (ρ[*]>[*] 1) 2 -band MWPT (or <b>even</b> MWT). <b>More</b> <b>importantly,</b> although the 2 -band MWPTs overcome many shortcomings of wavelet transforms, they retain the “ 2 -band” weakness of the latter, especially in spatial-frequency tiling, which has triggered great interest in their extension [1].|$|R

At d'Estouteville's inquiry of May 1452, two vital but highly placed witnesses were not called – Raoul Roussel, archbishop of Rouen and Jean Le Maître, vicar of the Inquisition in 1431. Though new testimonies were taken from two canons of Rouen cathedral, neither of them remembered very much about the events of 1431. By January 1453, d'Estouteville had returned to Rome, his principal mission to negotiate a peace having been unsuccessful. However, the Inquisitor Bréhal had been busy collecting information and learned opinions from canonists and theologians on the case. <b>Even</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> the month before saw the death of the Archbishop Roussel, removing a substantial obstacle to the reopening of the trial and the rehabilitation of Joan.|$|E

However the commander of the German forces {{in the east}}, Max Hoffmann, a chief negotiator in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, was facing increasing difficulties. He believed, rightly, that his army was the only stabilising influence over the Eastern Europe. Yet with the disintegration of Austria-Hungary, rise of Bolsheviks in the east and various independent governments between the former frontline and Germany, the former Oberkommando-Ostfront (or Ober-Ost) occupation zone became a thin line to nowhere, connected only to still-German Prussia. The deteriorating situation in Germany, facing the threat of civil war, eventually forced Hoffman to begin to retreat westwards, to Germany, in December 1918. Demoralized officers and mutinous soldiers abandoned their garrisons en masse and returned home. Only a limited number of units still retained any combat strength.|$|E

While operators constantly make efforts to improve reliability, and real-time arrival predictions reduce uncertainty for riders in transit, it is also possible to lessen frustration by better informing riders of system behavior beforehand. This work introduces a new method for understanding transit behavior through an analysis of historical arrival time data from San Francisco. The results identify impacts of timeliness on rider experience, such as that average wait time is minimized by showing up five minutes early, or that a five-minute transfer window will be successful 80 percent of the time.

25|$|<b>Even</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> the Third Anglo-Dutch War {{temporarily}} interrupted VOC {{trade with}} Europe. This caused {{a spike in}} the price of pepper, which enticed the English East India Company (EIC) to enter this market aggressively in the years after 1672. Previously, one of the tenets of the VOC pricing policy was to slightly over-supply the pepper market, so as to depress prices below the level where interlopers were encouraged to enter the market (instead of striving for short-term profit maximisation). The wisdom of such a policy was illustrated when a fierce price war with the EIC ensued, as that company flooded the market with new supplies from India. In this struggle for market share, the VOC (which had much larger financial resources) could wait out the EIC. Indeed, by 1683, the latter came close to bankruptcy; its share price plummeted from 600 to 250; and its president Josiah Child was temporarily forced from office.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 18th century, {{the disease was}} seen as similar to smallpox, due to its {{analogous}} symptoms. The personal physician of the Pope, Giovanni Maria Lancisi, recommended the slaughter of all infected and exposed animals. This policy was not very popular and used only sparingly {{in the first part}} of the century. Later, it was used successfully in several countries, although it was sometimes seen as too costly or drastic, and depended on a strong central authority to be effective (something which was notably lacking in the Dutch Republic). Because of these downsides, numerous attempts were made to inoculate animals against the disease. These attempts met with varying success, but the procedure was not widely used and was no longer practiced at all in 19th-century Western or Central Europe. Rinderpest was an immense problem, but inoculation was not a valid solution: In many cases, it caused too many losses. <b>Even</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> it perpetuated the circulation of the virus in the cattle population.

Many of the reservists who were called up for their National Service in the summer and fall of 1956 recalled feeling bewildered and confused as the Eden government started preparing to attack Egypt while at the same time Eden insisted in public that he wanted a peaceful resolution of the dispute, and was opposed to attacking Egypt. The British author David Pryce-Jones recalled that as a young officer, that after the ultimatum was submitted to Egypt he had to explain to his troops why war with Egypt was necessary without believing a word that he was saying.

40|$|A novel {{combination}} of hard carbon anode sodium pre-loading and a tailored electrolyte {{is used to}} prepare room temperature sodium-sulfur full cell batteries. The electrochemical loading with sodium ions is realized in a specific mixture of diethyl carbonate, ethylene carbonate, and fluoroethylene carbonate electrolyte {{in order to create}} a first solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the anode surface. Combining such anodes with a porous carbon/sulfur composite cathode results in full cells with a significantly decreased polysulfide shuttle when compared to half cells combined with metallic sodium anodes.

40|$|Abstract. Taenia solium 45 W {{proteins}} {{are good}} candidates {{for development of}} anti-cysticercosis vaccines. However, the genetic characteristics of the 45 gene family are still unclear between different isolates. We investigated the poly-morphism of the 45 gene family between Chinese and Mexican T. solium. Alignment showed that TSO 45 - 4 B and TSO 45 - 1 C antigens were conserved absolutely, whereas other TSO 45 proteins varied between these two isolates. It is informative to guide using of recombinant 45 W vaccines to control porcine cysticercosis caused by Asiatic or African/ Latin American T. solium. Cysticercosis is an important parasitic zoonosis caused by infection of the larval-stage Taenia solium.

25|$|Having {{received}} {{repeated and}} cryptic cablegrams from her husband, who {{had returned to}} Norway {{a year and a}} half earlier, Flagstad was forced to consider leaving the United States in 1941. Though dismissing the political implications of the departure of someone of her fame from the United States to German-occupied Norway, it was nonetheless a difficult decision for her. She had many friends, colleagues, and of course many fans all over the US. <b>Even</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> her 20-year-old daughter Else had married an American named Arthur Dusenberry and was living with her new husband on a dude ranch in Bozeman, Montana. It was Edwin McArthur who gave the bride away at the wedding in Bozeman a year earlier. Nonetheless, against the best advice of her friends and colleagues, including former president Herbert Hoover, who pleaded with her to stay out of Europe, she returned to Norway via Lisbon, Madrid, Barcelona, Marseille, and Berlin in April, 1941. Though during the war she performed only in Sweden and Switzerland, countries not occupied by German forces, this fact did not temper the storm of public opinion that hurt her personally and professionally for the next several years. Her husband was arrested after the war for profiteering during the occupation that involved his lumber business. This arrest, together with her decision to remain in occupied Norway, made her unpopular, particularly in the United States. The Norwegian ambassador and columnist Walter Winchell spoke out against her. In 1948, she performed several benefit concerts for the United Jewish Appeal. In defense of Flagstad's husband, Henry Johansen, it should be noted that after his death it was revealed that during the occupation he was arrested by the Gestapo and held for eight days. Also, one of Johansen's sons by his first marriage, Henry Jr, had been a member of the Norwegian underground throughout the war.|$|E
25|$|Before the British {{could decide}} upon a policy, however, Sukarno struck again, making an {{airborne}} assault Labis {{in the night}} of 1–2 September. Though the raid was a catastrophic failure, {{with one of the}} transport planes crashing en route, and the remainder of the troops arriving scattered with little food and battered morale, the move further infuriated the Malaysians, who in turn put pressure upon the British to act. The next day, colonial secretary Duncan Sandys authorized on-site naval commander Admiral Varyl Begg to plan for strikes against Indonesian bases in Sumatra. The British plans for retaliation were pre-empted once again, but this time by an act of their own. On August 27, the aircraft carrier HMS Victorious had sailed through the Sunda Straits without proper permission being gained from Indonesian authorities. The Indonesians, who feared that the British were attempting to provoke them into attacking the carrier as the Americans had the Vietnamese during the Gulf of Tonkin incident that had occurred earlier that month, were incensed. Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio barred the Victorious return passage through the Strait on 2 September, posing a direct challenge to the British. Officials in London determined that the challenge had to be met, and that the Victorious should return through the way it came. This stance, however, met important opposition. Washington {{did not want to be}} dragged into a military action due to the British overreaching themselves. And <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> Begg himself opposed the passage, due to the inability of the Victorious to defend herself in the Strait. What became known as the Sunda Straits Crisis was peacefully resolved, after several weeks of tension, by the Indonesians offering London another strait to pass through at Lombok, that gave the Allies an out from war, and Jakarta a passage that could be easily screened by their warships. By this time, tensions were beginning to wind to a close, though more landings were attempted that December, as both sides seemed to recognize the disadvantage of fully escalating the Confrontation through any greater action.|$|E
25|$|During {{the eighteenth}} century, {{there were no}} fewer than forty-four pretenders in Russia, twenty-six of which were during Catherine's reign. Pretenders plagued Catherine the Great's reign in a way {{unmatched}} by any other period in Russian history. At least seventeen of the twenty-six pretenders during Catherine's reign appeared {{in one of three}} clusters; six from 1764–1765, six from 1772–1774, and five from 1782–1786. Pretenders did not plague Catherine's reign because of her sex or nationality since pretenders never threatened other female rulers or rulers of foreign descent in the way that Catherine II was. The rise of pretenders was not related to war or famine as neither appeared consistently with the pretenders. If there tended to be any form of famine during a pretender's rise it was during their claim to power and not inspired by it. Catherine's illegitimate rise to power through the assassination of her husband, Peter III, did not inspire the pretenders since Elizabeth, who came to power in a similar fashion to Catherine, never had the same problem. Evidence suggests that pretenders plagued Catherine's reign for economic reasons. An important correlation between the three clusters is that the economic standing of serfs was declining. The condition of serfs worsened at the start of Catherine's reign because there was a sharp increase, 47%, in the number of peasants on state land and an establishment of a poll tax. The decline of pretenders illustrates the correlation between the conditions of serfs and the appearance of pretenders in the last third of Catherine's reign because she improved legal and economic conditions for the serfs to deter future pretenders. The serfs were not the only social group that suffered from worsening economic conditions. Leading into Catherine's reign both the odnodvortsy and cossacks faced a harsh decline in their economic standing. The odnodvortsy were particularly upset about the decline in their economic standing because they were descendents of wealthy landowning servicemen. The odnodvortsy were angered even more in some regions of Russia as land lords expanded their property claiming odnodvortsy and peasants as serfs. The declining standing of the odnodvortsy and cossacks created motivation to become pretenders especially during the 1760s. <b>Even</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly</b> the odnodvortsy and cossacks were vital support for pretenders because of their military experience.|$|E

40|$|Economic {{analyses}} of democracy often {{draw an analogy between}} democratic procedures and the ‘consumer sovereignty’ of the marketplace. In contrast, normative ideals of democracy often propose that voters should {{aim at the}} common good or justice. It is suggested that there is a fundamental difference between the appropriate norms of the market, in which self-interest is permitted, and those of the political forum, in which self-interest is prohibited. These ideals are apt, however, to invite charges of utopianism. While I accept that morality may sometimes be demanding, my aim in this article is to argue that the appropriate norms of the democratic forum are not as demanding as sometimes suggested; the market/forum contrast is often exaggerated. The market is not a state of nature, so some moral constraints apply <b>even</b> there. <b>More</b> <b>importantly,</b> self-interest is allowed some place in the political arena, at least where justice or the common good is indeterminate.

40|$|Transcription is {{the first}} step in gene expression, and it is the step at which most of the {{regulation}} of expression occurs. Although sequenced prokary-otic genomes provide a wealth of information, tran-scriptional regulatory networks are still poorly understood using the available genomic informa-tion, largely because accurate prediction of pro-moters is difficult. To improve promoter recognition performance, a novel variable-window Z-curve method is developed to extract general features of prokaryotic promoters. The features are used for further classification by the partial least squares technique. To verify the prediction performance, the proposed method is applied to predict promoter fragments of two representative prokaryotic model organisms (Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis). Depending on the feature extrac-tion and selection power of the proposed method, the promoter prediction accuracies are improved markedly over most existing approaches: for E. coli, the accuracies are 96. 05 % (s 70 promoters, coding negative samples), 90. 44 % (s 70 promoters, non-coding negative samples), 92. 13 % (known sigma-factor promoters, coding negative samples), 92. 50 % (known sigma-factor promoters, non-coding negative samples), respectively; for B. subtilis, the accuracies are 95. 83 % (known sigma-factor pro-moters, coding negative samples) and 99. 09 % (known sigma-factor promoters, non-coding nega-tive samples). Additionally, being a linear technique, the computational simplicity of the proposed method makes it easy to run in a matter of minutes on ordinary personal computers or <b>even</b> laptops. <b>More</b> <b>importantly,</b> there is no need to optimize par-ameters, so it is very practical for predicting other species promoters without any prior knowledge or prior information of the statistical properties of the samples...|$|R

This simple girl from a school hitherto unknown Ulu Tiram school has broken not only the record of previous SPM performances by scoring 17 Als in one sitting, but <b>more</b> <b>importantly</b> shattered many mindsets across the nation. For a while at least, the national school system has been vindicated from the unhealthy scepticism that are unfairly heaped on them...|$|R

We pro-pose a deterministic high-dimensional robust PCA algorithm which inherits all theoreti-cal properties of its randomized counterpart, i. e., it is tractable, robust to contaminated points, easily kernelizable, asymptotic con-sistent and achieves maximal robustness – a breakdown point of 50 %. <b>More</b> <b>importantly,</b> the proposed method exhibits significantly better computational efficiency, which makes it suitable for large-scale real applications. 1...|$|R
