25|$|Particle {{kinematics}} is {{the study}} of the trajectory of a particle. The position of a particle is defined as the coordinate vector from the origin of a coordinate frame to the particle. For example, consider a tower 50 m south <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>home,</b> where the coordinate frame is located at your home, such that East is the x-direction and North is the y-direction, then the coordinate vector {{to the base of the}} tower is r = (0, −50, 0). If the tower is 50m high, then the coordinate vector to the top of the tower is r = (0, −50, 50).|$|E

"Captain Davenant," [...] he said, [...] "I {{thank you}} most sincerely, {{on the part}} of myself, my wife and son, and, I may say, of my father, too, {{although}} at present he may not realize the kindness of your offer. I do not think it likely that, if James Stuart prevails, and Ireland is rent from England, we shall avail ourselves of your offer, for we have more than sufficient of this world's goods to remove to England, and there settle ourselves and our son, for assuredly Ireland would be no place where a Protestant could dwell in peace and quietness. Nevertheless, I thank you heartily, and shall ever gratefully bear in mind the promise you have made, and the fact that, although you have the power to turn us from our home, you have stayed from doing so. There has been much wrong done on both sides; and, from a boy, when I have seen you ride into or <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>home,</b> I have felt that I and mine wronged you, by being the possessors of your father's lands." ...|$|E

My messengers returned saying that you had fled <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>home</b> of Shefton Hall. They said further that it was rumoured that you had ridden with your foster-mother, Emlyn Stower, to Cranwell Towers, the house of Sir Christopher Harflete. If this be so, for the sake of your good name it is needful that you should remove from such company at once, as there is talk about you and the said Sir Christopher Harflete. I purpose, therefore, God permitting me, to ride this day to Cranwell Towers, and if you be there, as your lawful guardian and ghostly father, to command you, being an infant under age, to accompany me thence to the Nunnery of Blossholme. There I have determined, in the exercise of my authority, you shall abide until a fitting husband is found for you, unless, indeed, God should move your heart to remain within its walls as one of the brides of Christ.|$|E

60|$|But now, {{suppose you}} are an artist--and I use the word to cover all sorts of art, literary, {{dramatic}} and musical, as well as painting, sculpture, design and architecture--you want before all things freedom for personal expression, and you probably have an idea {{that this is the}} last thing you will get in the Socialist State. But, indeed, you will get far more than you do now. You will begin as a student, no doubt, in your local Municipal Art Schools, and there you will win prizes and scholarships and get some glorious years of youth and work in Italy or Paris, or Germany or London, or Boston or New York, or wherever the great teachers and workers of your art gather thickest; and then you will compete, perhaps, for some public work, and have something printed or published or reproduced and sold for you by your school or city; or get a loan <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>home</b> municipality for material--if your material costs money--and set to work making that into some saleable beautiful thing. If you are at all distinguished in quality, you will have a competition among public authorities from the beginning, to act as sponsors and dealers for your work; benevolent dealers they will be, and content with a commission. And if you make things that make many people interested and happy, you may by that fortunate gift of yours, grow to be as rich and magnificent a person as any one in the Socialist State. But if you do not please people at all, either the connoisseurs of the municipal art collection or private associations of art patrons or the popular buyer, well, then your lot will be no harder than the lot of any unsuccessful artist now; you will have to do something else for a time and win leisure to try again.|$|E
