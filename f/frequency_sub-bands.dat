50|$|In telecommunications, {{frequency-division}} multiplexing (FDM) {{is a technique}} by which the total bandwidth available in a communication medium is divided {{into a series of}} non-overlapping <b>frequency</b> <b>sub-bands,</b> each of which is used to carry a separate signal. This allows a single transmission medium such as the radio spectrum, a cable or optical fiber to be shared by multiple independent signals. Another use is to carry separate serial bits or segments of a higher rate signal in parallel. The most natural example of {{frequency-division multiplexing}} is radio and television broadcasting, in which multiple radio signals at different frequencies pass through the air at the same time. Another example is cable television, in which many television channels are carried simultaneously on a single cable. FDM is also used by telephone systems to transmit multiple telephone calls through high capacity trunklines, communications satellites to transmit multiple channels of data on uplink and downlink radio beams, and broadband DSL modems to transmit large amounts of computer data through twisted pair telephone lines, among many other uses.|$|E

Features of pen-position and pen-movement angle are extracted by the sub-band decomposition using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). In the pen-position, high <b>frequency</b> <b>sub-band</b> signals are considered as individual features {{to enhance the}} difference between a genuine signature and its forgery. On the other hand, low <b>frequency</b> <b>sub-band</b> signals are utilized as features for suppressing the intra-class variation in the pen-movement angle. Verification is achieved by the adaptive signal processing using the extracted features.

30|$|The EEG {{spectral}} analysis {{is based on}} a set of <b>frequency</b> <b>sub-bands.</b> Researchers have mainly used wavelet transform (WT) [3 – 16] and time-frequency distributions (TFD) [17 – 20] to analyse the EEG spectral patterns. However, although {{spectral analysis}} is a well-known approach, with numerus studies including spectral characteristics in the features extracted from the EEG, the importance of the <b>frequency</b> <b>sub-bands</b> that are used to analyse the signal has never been thoroughly investigated in the literature. It is medically established that brainwaves are divided based on their frequency into several sub-bands, being delta (1 – 4 [*]Hz), theta (4 – 8 [*]Hz), alpha (8 – 13 [*]Hz), beta (13 – 30 [*]Hz) and gamma (30 – 80 [*]Hz) [21]. Thus, several researchers roughly focus on these sub-bands [3 – 14, 17, 18], with the technical limitations that the analysis technique imposes (i.e. WT). Thus, the importance of the <b>frequency</b> <b>sub-bands</b> and their limits have not been analysed in the literature, since in WT-based approaches the <b>frequency</b> <b>sub-bands</b> are automatically set [3 – 16], while in TFD-based methodologies, an attempt to compare the impact of different sub-bands has been presented [17], however not being a systematic approach since only four different sub-band combinations were analysed.|$|E

Furthermore, <b>frequency</b> <b>sub-band</b> allocation by FFR has the benefit of allowing flexibility for the deployment of femto-cells through frequency partitioning. Determination of a proper frequency partitioning criterion between the cell-center and the cell-edge, and between the cells with femto-cells is an important issue. In addition, time resource partitioning introduces another degree of freedom {{to the design of}} time-frequency resource allocation. In this paper, we propose a novel time-frequency resource allocation mechanism using FFR for a macro-femto overlay cellular network. Feasible <b>frequency</b> <b>sub-band</b> and time resource is allocated to the cell-center and the cell-edge region in a cell by the proposed partitioning criterion and the time partitioning ratio. We provide a guideline for how to determine the partitioning criterion for the regions and how to design the amount of time resource.

30|$|The {{main focus}} {{of this study is}} to study the impact of {{frequency}} sub-band selection regarding the EEG epilepsy classification. To this end, a methodology has been developed, which initially defines the number of spectral thresholds (which determines the number of <b>frequency</b> <b>sub-bands</b> that are created) from 0 to 12, with 0 meaning that the overall frequency spectrum of the EEG is considered as a single frequency sub-band and all other values (1 – 12) defining the number of <b>frequency</b> <b>sub-bands</b> (i.e. for five spectral thresholds, six <b>frequency</b> <b>sub-bands</b> are created). Then, all possible combinations of these sub-bands are created, subject to simple limitations (i.e. the range of each sub-band is forced to be ≥[*] 2 [*]Hz). From each combination, a set of features is extracted, which are used in a classifier. The Bonn EEG database has been employed and results are obtained in terms of classification accuracy, indicating the importance of this study. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first systematic analysis of the impact of different frequency sub-band number and range, presented in the literature.
