This technology {{is similar to a}} movie on a Blu-ray Disc. However, Blu-ray Discs will have better video and audio quality because of their higher bitrates. Vudu utilizes the H.264 (MPEG-4 Part 10) encoding process along with proprietary encoding techniques dubbed TruFilm. TruFilm is composed of four main technologies designed to maximize the H.264 encoding standard: ...|$|R

40|$|Titles of {{research}} and review articles that satisfy the features of precision, 							information and easy-indexation require the mastering of certain linguistic and 							pragmatic skills from the researcher-writer. The mastering of this communicative 							competence exerts a demand especially on junior researchers at two important activities 							of their daily efforts: decoding and <b>encoding</b> <b>titles</b> when doing bibliographic searches 							and getting their own findings published. 							The purpose of this thesis work is to identify features, both linguistic and 							pragmatic, {{of research}} article (RA) and review article (RVA) titles {{in the field of}} 							Animal Production. The underlying hypothesis is that the titles of both genres will 							present structures with distinctive features. I expect that their identification will reveal 							particular features of the language of titles from these two scientific genres and the 							pragmatic functions that accord to the purposes of scientists in Animal Production, as 							well as how these features and functions may realize a well-written title. The study was 							based on a corpus of 480 titles, out of which 300 were RAs and 180 were RVAs, from 							prestigious international journals in electronic form from the period 2008 - 2011. Title 							length and lexical density were analyzed in the titles of the structures considered, 							namely noun phrase, compound construction, statements and questions. Heads in all 							structures, and pre and post modification in one-head noun phrase titles were analyzed, 							as well as the structures and pragmatic functions at both sides of the colonic titles. The 							results evidence some genre and discipline peculiarities worth considering for 							pedagogical purposes...|$|R
2500|$|HD DVD video can be encoded using VC-1, H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, or H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2. A {{wide variety}} of resolutions are {{supported}}, from low-resolution CIF, all SDTV resolutions supported by DVD-Video, and HDTV formats: 720p, 1080i, and 1080p. [...] All studio-released movie titles have featured video in a 1080-line format, with companion supplements in 480i or 480p. The vast majority of releases were encoded with VC-1, {{and most of the}} remaining <b>titles</b> <b>encoded</b> with H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.|$|R
5000|$|Extra {{features}} {{require additional}} storage space, which often means <b>encoding</b> the main <b>title</b> with lower than possible data rate to fit both the main title and the extras on one disc. Lower data rate may decrease visual and sound quality, which {{manifests itself in}} various compression artifacts. To maintain quality the main title and the extras may be released on several discs, or the extras may be omitted completely like in the [...] "Superbit" [...] line of DVDs.|$|R
50|$|Initially {{streaming}} {{starting in}} 2007 solely using Microsoft technologies and codecs such as VC-1 for video and Windows Media Audio (WMA) for audio, the rapid expansion {{and diversity of}} Netflix-capable devices have necessitated encoding into many different formats - including H.264 (AVC), VC-1, H.263 and H.265 (HEVC) for video, and Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital Plus, Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) and Ogg Vorbis for audio. According to Netflix, the vast number of codec and bitrate combinations can mean having to <b>encode</b> the same <b>title</b> 120 different times {{before it can be}} delivered to all streaming platforms.|$|R
30|$|Technology {{innovation}} has a {{long history}} of reshaping the organizational possibilities of a given era. Ink, paper, and movable type challenged the authority of the Roman church in the West and eventually provided the underpinnings of the nation state (Eisenstein 1980). Telegraph lines running alongside railroads helped create the managerial (rather than entrepreneurial) corporation in the late nineteenth century (Chandler 1990 b). Interstate highways built both predictable supply chains and consumer demand for US fast food restaurant chains such as Howard Johnson’s and McDonald’s after World War II (Schlosser 2000). Such common managerial artifacts as line and staff organization, complex reporting relationships (and the organization charts that <b>encode</b> them), and <b>titles</b> to reflect one’s status and stature emerged from the twentieth century military and industrial organizations that were built to harness new technological capabilities.|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} based on the {{analysis}} of 259 titles of articles selected from four American sociological journals (the American Journal of Sociology, Social Forces, the American Sociological Review and Social Problems), over a period of 60 years (1940 – 2000). These titles contain key words such as age(s), generation(s), life cycle and life course, as well as a group of words that identify the purpose of each specific article. The lexical analysis of the data gathered in this way allows us to observe how various orientations, themes and objects of research are <b>encoded</b> in the <b>titles.</b> Comparing how each of these terms is used shows the way in which sociological reasoning has integrated different perspectives on individual and social temporalities. We have established that each of the four different perspectives considered refers to an exclusive lexical repertoire, to themes of differentiated research that belong to a specific historical period...|$|R
50|$|Sales {{were very}} low and {{specialized}} during the 1980s. Audiophile reel tapes were made under license by Barclay-Crocker between 1977 and 1986. Licensors included Philips, Deutsche Grammophon, Argo, Vanguard, Musical Heritage Society and L'Oiseau Lyre, {{so there was}} a large selection of high quality performances with great artists. Barclay-Crocker tapes were all Dolby <b>encoded</b> and some <b>titles</b> were also available in the dbx format. The majority of the catalog contained classical recordings, with a few jazz and movie soundtrack albums. Barclay-Crocker tapes were duplicated on modified Ampex 440 machines at four times the playing speed, unlike popular reel tapes which were duplicated at 16 times the playback speed. All of the known pre-recorded reel-to-reels on the market are all documented at the Reel To Reel Index Website which focuses on the last reels made during the 1980s and includes photographs of all of them. David Winter also released the complete list of 1950's EMI and Barclay-Crocker tapes.|$|R
40|$|The papers {{examines}} 1, 000 English {{titles of}} academic publications in linguistics, dated between 1970 and 2004, exemplifying four publication types (books, dissertations, journal articles and proceedings papers) and ten keywords (i. e. bilingual(s); discourse; learning; morphology; phonetic/phonological; pragmatic(s); semantic; sociolinguistic; speech act(s) /lexical; syntactic/syntax) representing different areas and topics of investigation in linguistics. Aspects analysed include length in words, structural organization, macro and micro syntactic encoding, lexical density, content, information sequencing, semantic-syntactic forms of expansion. The titles display both {{similarities and differences}} across publication types. Similarities include: high lexical density; preference {{for one or two}} information units; sequencing of information in two-unit titles as a transition from a general topic to a specific one; frequent syntactic <b>encoding</b> of <b>title</b> units as noun phrases; high frequency of coordinated noun phrases, of adjectival pre-modification of nominal heads, and of prepositional post-modification of nominal heads; and frequent reference to the languages and technical aspects of the studies named by the titles. Differences have to do with ordered frequency hierarchies (i. e. dissertation > journal articles > proceedings articles > books) in the distribution of certain features: the length of the titles in number of words (per sub-corpus, title and title unit), and the occurrence of total expansions, pre-modification strategies, post-modification resources, function words and information units about context. Other features, however, reveal variable cross-genre distributional preferences, {{as is the case with}} number of total units, frequency of one-title units, occurrence of coordination or post-modification strategies, and sequencing of information units in two-unit titles. The sub-corpora, therefore, display fairly distinctive traits, but not totally clear-cut differences...|$|R
