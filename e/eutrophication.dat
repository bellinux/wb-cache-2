5|$|Damming of the Canning caused {{dramatic}} flow reductions {{that significantly}} altered downstream aquatic macroinvertebrate communities. The {{lack of water}} flow has also resulted in a poor flushing effect below the dam wall. An excessive amount of nutrients from fertilizers and animal waste has caused algal blooms and <b>eutrophication.</b>|$|E
5|$|The oceans {{may have}} become more hospitable to life over the last 500million years and less {{vulnerable}} to mass extinctions: dissolved oxygen became more widespread and penetrated to greater depths; the development of life on land reduced the run-off of nutrients and hence the risk of <b>eutrophication</b> and anoxic events; marine ecosystems became more diversified so that food chains {{were less likely to}} be disrupted.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} of rapid {{economic}} growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed {{by the government and}} industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s. Responding to rising concern about the problem, the government introduced several environmental protection laws in 1970. The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources. Current environmental issues include urban air pollution (NOx, suspended particulate matter, and toxics), waste management, water <b>eutrophication,</b> nature conservation, climate change, chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.|$|E
5|$|Many industrially {{important}} compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. The extremely strong {{triple bond}} in elemental nitrogen (N≡N), the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide (CO), dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N2 into useful compounds, {{but at the}} same time means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy. Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers, and fertiliser nitrates are key pollutants in the <b>eutrophication</b> of water systems.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{in the late}} 1980s the Western Atlantic ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally {{introduced}} into the Black Sea and Sea of Azov via the ballast tanks of ships, and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish. Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories (although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea), as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate {{a wide range of}} water temperatures and salinities. The impact was increased by chronic overfishing, and by <b>eutrophication</b> that gave the entire ecosystem a short-term boost, causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal – and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores. Mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata, and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993, which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism. However the abundance of plankton in the area seems unlikely to be restored to pre-Mnemiopsis levels.|$|E
5|$|The Sulphur Creek {{watershed}} {{has had a}} {{long history}} of water pollution, which can be attributed to residential development. While no raw sewage flows into the creek, the creek is contaminated by large quantities of urban runoff from impervious paved surfaces that collects toxins before pouring untreated into the creek. There are over four large storm drain outlets that pour directly into Sulphur Creek. Such untreated runoff has caused E. coli and Enterovirus to increasingly harm the creek and its remaining biodiversity. Channelization is also another factor, and standing water in the Sulphur Creek Reservoir has suffered <b>eutrophication.</b> The primary source of bacteria contamination is the largest tributary of Sulphur Creek, now mostly underground. The channel joins the creek not too far from its mouth. It has been proved that 87 percent of the Sulphur Creek mainstem is severely degraded.|$|E
5|$|Even though Croatia has {{sufficient}} water resources at its disposal, {{these are not}} uniformly distributed and public water supply network losses remain high—estimated at 44%. Between 2004 and 2008, the number of stations monitoring surface water pollution increased by 20%; the CEA reported 476 cases of water pollution in this period. At the same time organic waste pollution levels decreased slightly, which is attributed to the completion of new sewage treatment plants; their number increased 20%, reaching a total of 101. Nearly all of Croatia's groundwater aquifers are top quality, unlike the available surface water; the latter's quality varies in terms of biochemical oxygen demand and bacteriological water analysis results. As of 2008, 80% of the Croatian population are served by the public water supply system, but only 44% of the population {{have access to the}} public sewerage network, with septic systems in use. Adriatic Sea water quality monitoring between 2004 and 2008 indicated very good, oligotrophic conditions along most of the coast, while areas of increased <b>eutrophication</b> were identified in the Bay of Bakar, the Bay of Kaštela, the Port of Šibenik and near Ploče; other areas of localized pollution were identified near the larger coastal cities. In the period between 2004 and 2008, the CEA identified 283 cases of marine pollution (including 128 from vessels), which was a drop of 15% relative to the period encompassed by the previous report, 1997 to August 2005.|$|E
5|$|The lake {{does not}} meet the National Water Quality Standards due to its high {{concentration}} of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). Considering the adverse impact on the lake water quality due to <b>Eutrophication,</b> anthropogenic pressures and holy rituals and tourism, a water quality study was specifically undertaken at four sites on a monthly basis for six months. The sampling sites were chosen to represent the pressure of pilgrims and other pollution inflows at the locations. The water samples were analysed for temperature, pH, salinity, conductivity, total dissolved solids, alkalinity, hardness, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, chloride, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, sodium, ammonium, potassium, total chlorophyll, biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand. The analysis over the period has revealed that the lake water was alkaline, chloride and conductivity concentrations were high at all the four sites, and there were lower levels of dissolved oxygen (at sites with greater pollution load) and high hardness (on account of excess of calcium and magnesium from surface run-off). During the period of the annual Pushkar Fair, a distinct co-relationship was discerned between various parameters analysed and the degree of water pollution in the lake. This has called for urgent remedial actions to be undertaken by all of the government agencies involved with the lake management, with people's participation.|$|E
25|$|Any {{factor that}} causes {{increased}} nutrient concentrations can potentially lead to <b>eutrophication.</b> In modeling <b>eutrophication,</b> {{the rate of}} water renewal plays a critical role; stagnant water is allowed to collect more nutrients than bodies with replenished water supplies. It {{has also been shown}} that the drying of wetlands causes an increase in nutrient concentration and subsequent <b>eutrophication</b> blooms.|$|E
25|$|Because a body {{of water}} can have an effect on a range of people {{reaching}} far beyond that of the watershed, cooperation between different organizations is necessary to prevent the intrusion of contaminants that can lead to <b>eutrophication.</b> Agencies ranging from state governments to those of water resource management and non-governmental organizations, going as low as the local population, are responsible for preventing <b>eutrophication</b> of water bodies. In the United States, the most well known inter-state effort to prevent <b>eutrophication</b> is the Chesapeake Bay.|$|E
25|$|Long-stalked {{pondweed}} {{is relatively}} sensitive to <b>eutrophication</b> and declines or local extinctions {{of this species}} {{have been associated with}} increased nutrent levels. In Loch Leven (Scotland), P. praelongus was lost due to <b>eutrophication</b> during the mid 20th century, but has recently reappeared following improvements to water quality.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{chemical}} substances are toxic. Pathogens can produce waterborne diseases in either human or animal hosts. Alteration of water's physical chemistry includes acidity (change in pH), electrical conductivity, temperature, and <b>eutrophication.</b> <b>Eutrophication</b> {{is an increase in}} the concentration of chemical nutrients in an ecosystem to an extent that increases the primary productivity of the ecosystem. Depending on the degree of <b>eutrophication,</b> subsequent negative environmental effects such as anoxia (oxygen depletion) and severe reductions in water quality may occur, affecting fish and other animal populations.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{fertilizer}} and organic waste that urban runoff often carries, <b>eutrophication</b> often occurs in waterways {{affected by this}} type of runoff. After heavy rains, organic matter in the waterway is relatively high compared with natural levels, spurring growth of algae blooms that soon consume most of the oxygen. Once the naturally occurring oxygen in the water is depleted, the algae blooms die, and their decomposition causes further <b>eutrophication.</b> Algae blooms mostly occur in areas with still water, such as stream pools and the pools behind dams, weirs, and some drop structures. <b>Eutrophication</b> usually comes with deadly consequences for fish and other aquatic organisms.|$|E
25|$|Some bays {{also have}} {{problems}} with <b>eutrophication</b> and have become overgrown with algae and plant plankton.|$|E
25|$|Cultural <b>Eutrophication</b> is {{the process}} that speeds up natural <b>eutrophication</b> because of human activity. Due to {{clearing}} of land and building of towns and cities, land runoff is accelerated and more nutrients such as phosphates and nitrate are supplied to lakes and rivers, and then to coastal estuaries and bays. Extra nutrients are also supplied by treatment plants, golf courses, fertilizers, farms, as well as untreated sewage in many countries.|$|E
25|$|<b>Eutrophication,</b> {{excessive}} {{nutrients in}} aquatic ecosystems resulting in algal blooms and anoxia, leads to fish kills, loss of biodiversity, and renders water unfit for drinking and other industrial uses. Excessive fertilization and manure application to cropland, {{as well as}} high livestock stocking densities cause nutrient (mainly nitrogen and phosphorus) runoff and leaching from agricultural land. These nutrients are major nonpoint pollutants contributing to <b>eutrophication</b> of aquatic ecosystems.|$|E
25|$|<b>Eutrophication</b> poses {{a problem}} {{not only to}} ecosystems, but to humans as well. Reducing <b>eutrophication</b> should be a key concern when {{considering}} future policy, and a sustainable solution for everyone, including farmers and ranchers, seems feasible. While <b>eutrophication</b> does pose problems, humans {{should be aware that}} natural runoff (which causes algal blooms in the wild) is common in ecosystems and should thus not reverse nutrient concentrations beyond normal levels. Cleanup measures have been mostly, but not completely, successful. Finnish phosphorus removal measures started in the mid-1970s and have targeted rivers and lakes polluted by industrial and municipal discharges. These efforts have had a 90% removal efficiency. Still, some targeted point sources did not show a decrease in runoff despite reduction efforts.|$|E
25|$|<b>Eutrophication</b> is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} in coastal waters. In contrast to freshwater systems, nitrogen is more commonly the key limiting nutrient of marine waters; thus, nitrogen levels have greater importance to understanding <b>eutrophication</b> problems in salt water. Estuaries tend to be naturally eutrophic because land-derived nutrients are concentrated where run-off enters a confined channel. Upwelling in coastal systems also promotes increased productivity by conveying deep, nutrient-rich waters to the surface, where the nutrients can be assimilated by algae.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>eutrophication</b> is {{commonly}} caused by human activities, {{it can also}} be a natural process, particularly in lakes. Eutrophy occurs in many lakes in temperate grasslands, for instance. Paleolimnologists now recognise that climate change, geology, and other external influences are critical in regulating the natural productivity of lakes. Some lakes also demonstrate the reverse process (meiotrophication), becoming less nutrient rich with time. The main difference between natural and anthropogenic <b>eutrophication</b> is that the natural process is very slow, occurring on geological time scales.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to their}} very high {{solubility}} and because soils are highly unable to retain anions, nitrates can enter groundwater. Elevated nitrate in groundwater {{is a concern}} for drinking water use because nitrate can interfere with blood-oxygen levels in infants and cause methemoglobinemia or blue-baby syndrome. Where groundwater recharges stream flow, nitrate-enriched groundwater can contribute to <b>eutrophication,</b> a process that leads to high algal population and growth, especially blue-green algal populations. While not directly toxic to fish life, like ammonia, nitrate can have indirect effects on fish if it contributes to this <b>eutrophication.</b> Nitrogen has contributed to severe <b>eutrophication</b> problems in some water bodies. Since 2006, the application of nitrogen fertilizer has been increasingly controlled in Britain and the United States. This is occurring {{along the same lines}} as control of phosphorus fertilizer, restriction of which is normally considered essential to the recovery of eutrophied waterbodies.|$|E
25|$|IMTA {{promotes}} {{economic and}} environmental sustainability by converting byproducts and uneaten feed from fed organisms into harvestable crops, thereby reducing <b>eutrophication,</b> and increasing economic diversification.|$|E
25|$|Policy {{concerning}} the prevention and reduction of <b>eutrophication</b> {{can be broken}} down into four sectors: Technologies, public participation, economic instruments, and cooperation. The term technology is used loosely, referring to a more widespread use of existing methods rather than an appropriation of new technologies. As mentioned before, nonpoint sources of pollution are the primary contributors to <b>eutrophication,</b> and their effects can be easily minimized through common agricultural practices. Reducing the amount of pollutants that reach a watershed can be achieved through the protection of its forest cover, reducing the amount of erosion leeching into a watershed. Also, through the efficient, controlled use of land using sustainable agricultural practices to minimize land degradation, the amount of soil runoff and nitrogen-based fertilizers reaching a watershed can be reduced. Waste disposal technology constitutes another factor in <b>eutrophication</b> prevention. Because a major contributor to the nonpoint source nutrient loading of water bodies is untreated domestic sewage, it is necessary to provide treatment facilities to highly urbanized areas, particularly those in underdeveloped nations, in which treatment of domestic waste water is a scarcity. The technology to safely and efficiently reuse waste water, both from domestic and industrial sources, should be a primary concern for policy regarding <b>eutrophication.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Eutrophication</b> {{may cause}} {{competitive}} release by making abundant a normally limiting nutrient. This process causes {{shifts in the}} species composition of ecosystems. For instance, an increase in nitrogen might allow new, competitive species to invade and out-compete original inhabitant species. This {{has been shown to}} occur in New England salt marshes. In Europe and Asia, the common carp frequently lives in naturally Eutrophic or Hypereutrophic areas, and is adapted to living in such conditions. The <b>eutrophication</b> of areas outside its natural range partially explain the fish's success in colonising these areas after being introduced.|$|E
25|$|The lakes play a {{vital role}} in the University’s {{stormwater}} system, but they are shallow, making them susceptible to <b>eutrophication.</b> Each spring harvesting takes place to remove excess water weed and remove pest fish.|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies have}} shown that {{nitrogen}} <b>eutrophication</b> decreases the amount of carbon allocation to soil biota over longer periods of time. This can pose problems to the mycobionts, whose production of sporocarps later in the growing season is totally dependent upon the allocation of photosynthates from host plants. Unlike the major community shifts that can occur in sporocarp responses to nitrogen addition, root tips and soil hyphae respond in a considerably subtler manner in the short term. However, over longer periods of time, <b>eutrophication</b> can cause major shifts in the dominant fungi and dramatically alter belowground diversity.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} gauge {{how to best}} prevent <b>eutrophication</b> from occurring, {{specific}} sources that contribute to nutrient loading must be identified. There are two common sources of nutrients and organic matter: point and nonpoint sources.|$|E
25|$|Other <b>eutrophication</b> studies {{performed}} in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island found that experimental nitrogen addition initially increases plant productivity but eventually leads to reduced plant biomass due to insect herbivory (Bertness et al. 2008). To supplement this experiment, researchers took surveys across 20 salt marshes {{to look at}} the interaction between marsh nutrient levels and herbivore pressure and found that marsh nitrogen supply was a good predictor of herbivore damage to plants. This study suggests that <b>eutrophication</b> is currently triggering consumer suppression of primary productivity in New England salt marshes and may eventually pose a threat to salt marsh ecosystem service provisioning (Bertness et al. 2008).|$|E
25|$|The second mass {{extinction}} was the Late Devonian extinction, probably {{caused by the}} evolution of trees, which could {{have led to the}} depletion of greenhouse gases (like CO2) or the <b>eutrophication</b> of water. 70% of all species became extinct.|$|E
25|$|<b>Eutrophication</b> {{arises from}} the {{oversupply}} of nutrients, which leads to overgrowth of plants and algae. After such organisms die, the bacterial degradation of their biomass consumes the oxygen in the water, thereby creating the state of hypoxia.|$|E
25|$|Bertness and Silliman {{have also}} {{suggested}} that while salt marshes may have historically been nutrient limited and bottom up controlled, human disturbances such as <b>eutrophication</b> and predator depletion has shifted these systems to top down control in recent decades (Bertness and Silliman 2008).|$|E
25|$|Nonpoint {{pollution}} {{is the most}} difficult source of nutrients to manage. The literature suggests, though, that when these sources are controlled, <b>eutrophication</b> decreases. The following steps are recommended to minimize the amount of pollution that can enter aquatic ecosystems from ambiguous sources.|$|E
25|$|Plans to artificially {{oxygenate}} {{areas of}} the Baltic that have experienced <b>eutrophication</b> have been proposed by the University of Gothenburg and Inocean AB. The proposal intends to use wind-driven pumps to inject oxygen (air) into waters at, or around, 130m below sea level.|$|E
25|$|Terrestrial {{ecosystems}} {{are subject to}} similarly adverse impacts from <b>eutrophication.</b> Increased nitrates in soil are frequently undesirable for plants. Many terrestrial plant species are endangered {{as a result of}} soil <b>eutrophication,</b> such as the majority of orchid species in Europe. Meadows, forests, and bogs are characterized by low nutrient content and slowly growing species adapted to those levels, so they can be overgrown by faster growing and more competitive species. In meadows, tall grasses that can take advantage of higher nitrogen levels may change the area so that natural species may be lost. Species-rich fens can be overtaken by reed or reedgrass species. Forest undergrowth affected by run-off from a nearby fertilized field can be turned into a nettle and bramble thicket.|$|E
25|$|Environmentally {{hazardous}} substances {{are not necessarily}} poisons, and vice versa. For example, food-industry wastewater—which may contain potato juice or milk—can be hazardous to the ecosystems of streams and rivers by consuming oxygen and causing <b>eutrophication,</b> but is nonhazardous to humans and not classified as a poison.|$|E
25|$|On the Lac du Bourget, {{with several}} {{thousand}} people in addition {{to tens of thousands}} of tourists, the water quality had gradually deteriorated from the 1950s to 1970 in a major phenomenon of <b>eutrophication,</b> since the lake at the time was the natural outlet of all sewer pipes, with in particular, Chambéry and Aix-les-Bains. Many motor vehicles of the time were also highly polluting, spitting their fumes which partially dissolved in the waters and spilt oil which was also found in the lake. They made a lot of noise and noise generated was damaging to birds and small mammals. A remediation action has been engaged since the mid-1970s, in order to reduce the <b>eutrophication</b> of the lake, the aim being to arrive at the same results as for Lake Annecy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Eutrophication</b> is an {{increase}} in chemical nutrients, typically compounds containing nitrogen or phosphorus, in an ecosystem. It can result in {{an increase}} in the ecosystem's primary productivity (excessive plant growth and decay), and further effects including lack of oxygen and severe reductions in water quality, fish, and other animal populations.|$|E
