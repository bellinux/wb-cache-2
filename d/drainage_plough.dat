As the horses drove the winch, the rope would drag the mole plough across the field, digging a drainage channel and inserting a length of drainage pipes.

40|$|Abstract. Physico-chemical {{parameters}} of the rice field water of Bukit Merah Agricultural Experimental Station (BMAES), Penang, Malaysia were investigated during two cultivation seasons of 2004 / 2005. The selected variables showed wide ranges of variation. Except for total organic matter (TOM) and total suspended solid (TSS), the values of all variables were significantly different at all sampling occasions. Most of the physico-chemical parameters showed significant relationship to the water level either {{in the presence of}} rice plant or after harvesting of the crop. The rice agroecosystem is a complex ecosystem due to the interaction of aquatic organisms, including algae and macrophytes. This unique swampy ecosystem is usually disrupted during <b>ploughing,</b> <b>drainage,</b> harvesting and application of fertilizers and pesticides. It was concluded that the agricultural activities in this rice field contributed effectively in creating the wide variations in the values of physico-chemical parameters...|$|R
40|$|The Burrishoole {{catchment}} {{is situated}} in County Mayo, on the northwest coast of the Republic of Ireland. Much of the catchment is covered by blanket peat that, in many areas, has become heavily eroded in recent years. This {{is thought to be}} due, primarily, to the adverse effects of forestry and agricultural activities in the area. Such activities include <b>ploughing,</b> <b>drainage,</b> the planting and harvesting of trees, and sheep farming, all of which are potentially damaging to such a sensitive landscape if not managed carefully. This article examines the sediment yield and hydrology of the Burrishoole catchment. Flow and sediment concentrations were measured at 8 -hourly intervals from 5 February 2001 to 8 November 2001 with an automatic sampler and separate flow gauge, and hourly averages were recorded between 4 July 2002 and 6 September 2002 using an automatic river monitoring system [ARMS]. The authors describe the GIS-based model of soil erosion and transport that was applied to the Burrishoole catchment during this study. The results of these analyses were compared, in a qualitative manner, with the aerial photography available for the Burrishoole catchment to see whether areas that were predicted to contribute large proportions of eroded material to the drainage network corresponded with areas where peat erosion could be identified through photo-interpretation...|$|R

60|$|That was a sight {{not easily}} to be forgotten. But {{we need not}} have gone so far from home, at least, a few hundred years ago, to see an exactly similar one. The fens of Norfolk and Cambridgeshire, before the rivers were embanked, the water pumped off, the forests felled, and the reed-beds {{ploughed}} up, were exactly in the same state. The vast deposits of peat between Cambridge and the sea, often filled with timber-trees, either fallen or upright as they grew, and often mixed with beds of sand or mud, brought down in floods, were formed {{in exactly the same}} way; and if they had remained undrained, then that slow sinking, which geologists say is going on over the whole area of the Fens, would have brought them gradually, but surely, below the sea-level, to be covered up by new forests, and converted in due time into coal. And future geologists would have found--they may find yet, if, which God forbid, England should become barbarous and the trees be thrown out of cultivation--instead of fossil Lepidodendra and Sigillariae, Calamites and ferns, fossil ashes and oaks, alders and poplars, bulrushes and reeds. Almost the only fossil fern would have been that tall and beautiful Lastraea Thelypteris, once so abundant, now all but destroyed by <b>drainage</b> and the <b>plough.</b>|$|R
40|$|Ploughed upland drains are {{straight}} prismatic channels of low aspect ratio. The drains are either uniformly or compositely roughened. In compositely roughened drains {{the bed and}} side-walls are differentially roughened although each roughness type is homogeneous. Upland catchments, containing extensive <b>ploughed</b> <b>drainage</b> networks, are particularly prone to flash flooding and increased sediment yield. However, the basic hydraulic data necessary to route flow through the drainage network and improve the engineering design of stable drainage channels are currently unavailable. A logarithmic flow resistance equation is developed for low aspect ratio channels, where the effective Nikuradse equivalent grain size is known. Testing against field data indicates that the relationship successfully predicts the resistance to uniform flow through upland drains. The performance of eight composite roughness formulae to predict the mean velocity in differentially roughened channels is compared. The composite roughness equations involve dividing the cross-sectional flow area {{into a number of}} sub-areas. The different methods of cross-sectional area division are considered and their effect on mean velocity prediction examined. Preferences are indicated concerning composite roughness equations which predict the mean velocity in channels of simple cross-sectional shape. Empirical equations are derived to determine the mean bed and side-wall shear stresses in straight symmetrical trapezoidal and rectangular open channels, with uniform or composite roughness. The model proposed is appropriate for stable sub-critical and super-critical flows. The equations are based on data collected from laboratory channels and should be cautiously applied to larger scale channels. Using the mean shear stress model, a design procedure is proposed to improve drainage channel stability...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} CO 2 flux {{data from}} 18 forest ecosystems, {{studied in the}} European Union funded EUROFLUX project. Overall, mean annual gross primary productivity (GPP, {{the total amount of}} carbon (C) fixed during photosynthesis) of these forests was 1380 +/- 330 gC m(- 2) y(- 1) (mean +/- SD). On average, 80 % of GPP was respired by autotrophs and heterotrophs and released back into the atmosphere (total ecosystem respiration, TER= 1100 +/- 260 gC m(- 2) y(- 1)). Mean annual soil respiration (SR) was 760 +/- 340 gC m(- 2) y(- 1) (55 % of GPP and 69 % of TER). Among the investigated forests, large differences were observed in annual SR and TER that were not correlated with mean annual temperature. However, a significant correlation was observed between annual SR and TER and GPP among the relatively undisturbed forests. On the assumption that (i) root respiration is constrained by the allocation of photosynthates to the roots, which is coupled to productivity, and that (ii) the largest fraction of heterotrophic soil respiration originates from decomposition of young organic matter (leaves, fine roots), whose availability also depends on primary productivity, it is hypothesized that differences in SR among forests are likely to depend more on productivity than on temperature. At sites where soil disturbance has occurred (e. g. <b>ploughing,</b> <b>drainage),</b> soil espiration was a larger component of the ecosystem C budget and deviated from the relationship between annual SR land TER) and GPP observed among the less-disturbed forests. At one particular forest, carbon losses from the soil were so large, that in some years the site became a net source of carbon to the atmosphere. Excluding the disturbed sites from the present analysis reduced mean SR to 660 +/- 290 g C m(- 2) y(- 1), representing 49 % of GPP and 63 % of TER in the relatively undisturbed forest ecosystems.

40|$|The {{use of the}} trenchless <b>plough</b> <b>drainage</b> {{implement}} {{has increased}} {{in the past few}} years due to its efficiency and cost advantages over other methods. However, the performance of these machines when working in fields with irregular soil conditions is not yet satisfactory. It is important therefore to study the soil parameters and conditions which could affect the implement behaviour under these circumstances. Therefore, a detailed investigation of the soil reaction forces acting upon a scale model of the trenchless plough was conducted under controlled conditions in a soil laboratory. The model was tested first under restricted conditions of movement, in order to observe and determine all the possible soil reaction forces. The tine, due to its geometric characteristics, was classified as a very narrow tine, and an existing model to predict the soil reaction force acting on the front face of these tines was extended to predict the forces on the sides. Since the length of the failure plane ahead of the tine is often required in the investigation of the soil reaction forces, a mathematical solution based on the Coulomb principle of Passive Earth Pressure was presented to estimate the soil failure pattern. There was good agreement between the values of the angle of the shear plane predicted by this method and the experimental data obtained from the glass sided tank tests. Dynamic tests were conducted with the implement assembled with a long floating beam arrangement assisted by a small link (free-link), used between the hitch-point and the pivoted end of the beam. These tests revealed that, when working over irregular soil conditions a better grade control can be obtained if the hitch-point is kept at constant level in reference to a desired line. In the case where field irregularities persist for long (step inputs), corrections in the hitch-point height might be necessary. These tests show that the implement depth changes in different proportion in relation to the hitch-point height. Where no control is imposed on the hitch-point, the path of the implement is attenuated in relation to the hitch-point position, where better results are obtained for high frequency of the hitch-point. A mathematical solution based on these findings and on the dynamic balance of the forces acting on the system was presented. Since it is an interactive method and requires long and repetitive calculations, a computer programme was developed and used to predict the response of the implement under these uneven conditions. Good agreement between data and estimated values suggested that the method is acceptable...|$|R
