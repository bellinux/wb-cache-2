25|$|The {{supplement}} of {{an interior}} angle is called an <b>exterior</b> <b>angle,</b> that is, an interior angle and an <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> form a linear pair of angles. There are two exterior angles at each vertex of the polygon, each determined by extending {{one of the}} two sides of the polygon that meet at the vertex; these two angles are vertical angles and hence are equal. An <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> measures the amount of rotation one has to make at a vertex to trace out the polygon. If the corresponding interior angle is a reflex angle, the <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> should be considered negative. Even in a non-simple polygon it may be possible to define the <b>exterior</b> <b>angle,</b> but one will have to pick an orientation of the plane (or surface) to decide the sign of the <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> measure.|$|E
25|$|Some authors use {{the name}} <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> {{of a simple}} polygon to simply mean the explement <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> (not supplement!) of the {{interior}} angle. This conflicts with the above usage.|$|E

50|$|In the plane, angles about a point {{add up to}} 360°, while {{interior}} angles in a triangle add up to 180° (equivalently, <b>exterior</b> <b>angles</b> add up to 360°). However, on a convex polyhedron the angles at a vertex on average add up to less than 360°, on a spherical triangle the {{interior angles}} always add {{up to more than}} 180° (the <b>exterior</b> <b>angles</b> add up to less than 360°), and the angles in a hyperbolic triangle always add up to less than 180° (the <b>exterior</b> <b>angles</b> add up to more than 360°).|$|R

25|$|The {{sum of the}} {{measures}} of the interior angles of a triangle in Euclidean space is always 180 degrees. This fact is equivalent to Euclid's parallel postulate. This allows determination of {{the measure of the}} third angle of any triangle given the measure of two angles. An <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> of a triangle is an angle that is a linear pair (and hence supplementary) to an interior angle. The measure of an <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> of a triangle is equal to the sum of {{the measures}} of the two interior angles that are not adjacent to it; this is the <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> theorem. The sum of the measures of the three exterior angles (one for each vertex) of any triangle is 360 degrees.|$|E
25|$|In a triangle, three {{intersection}} points, two of {{them between}} an interior angle bisector and the opposite side, and the third between the other <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> bisector and the opposite side extended, are collinear.|$|E
25|$|Analogously, a {{line segment}} PD through some point D on AB {{extended}} bisects the corresponding <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> BPQ where Q is on AP extended. Since {{the interior and}} exterior angles sum to 180 degrees, the angle CPD is exactly 90 degrees, i.e., a right angle. The set of points P such that angle CPD is a right angle forms a circle, of which CD is a diameter.|$|E

25|$|For {{algorithmic}} applications it is {{of particular}} interest to characterize pseudotriangles that are polygons. In a polygon, a vertex is convex if it spans an interior angle of less than π, and concave otherwise (in particular, we consider an angle of exactly π to be concave). Any polygon must have at least three convex angles, because the total <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> of a polygon is 2π, the convex angles contribute less than π each to this total, and the concave angles contribute zero or negative amounts. A polygonal pseudotriangle is a polygon that has exactly three convex vertices. In particular, any triangle, and any nonconvex quadrilateral, is a pseudotriangle.|$|E
2500|$|In Euclidean geometry, {{the sum of}} the {{exterior}} angles of a simple convex polygon will be one full turn (360°).

2500|$|<b>Exterior</b> <b>angle</b> – The <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> is the {{supplementary}} {{angle to}} the interior angle. Tracing around a convex n-gon, the angle [...] "turned" [...] at a corner is the exterior or external angle. Tracing {{all the way around}} the polygon makes one full turn, so the sum of the exterior angles must be 360°. This argument can be generalized to concave simple polygons, if external angles that turn in the opposite direction are subtracted from the total turned. Tracing around an n-gon in general, the sum of the exterior angles (the total amount one rotates at the vertices) can be any integer multiple d of 360°, e.g. 720° for a pentagram and 0° for an angular [...] "eight" [...] or antiparallelogram, where d is the density or starriness of the polygon.

40|$|For Bezier curves, {{subdivision}} algorithms create control polygons as {{piecewise linear}} (PL) approximations that converge {{in terms of}} Hausdorff distance.

This angular convergence is useful for determining topological features. We use it to show homeomorphism between a Bezier curve and its control polygon under subdivision. The constructive geometric proofs yield closed-form formulas to compute sufficient numbers of subdivision iterations to obtain small <b>exterior</b> <b>angles</b> and achieve homeomorphism.
