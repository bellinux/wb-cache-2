500|$|R v Thomas was an Australian {{court case}} {{decided in the}} Victorian Court of Appeal on 18 August 2006. It {{concerned}} the conviction in February 2006 of Joseph Thomas (nicknamed [...] "Jihad Jack" [...] in the media) on terrorism-related charges, specifically receiving funds <b>from</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda.</b> The appeal revolved around the admissibility of a confession Thomas made during an interrogation in Pakistan in 2003. The court found that the evidence, which was crucial to Thomas' convictions, was inadmissible because {{it had not been}} given voluntarily. The court accordingly quashed his convictions, but after further hearings ordered on 20 December 2006 that he be retried rather than acquitted.|$|E
500|$|In 2003 or 2004 he {{organised}} an Islamic-themed camping trip, {{at which}} Bakri lectured, on the [...] {{grounds of the}} Jameah Islamiyah School in East Sussex. [...] Advertised by word-of-mouth, the trip was attended by 50Muslim men, {{most of whom were}} members of al-Muhajiroun. [...] Bakri later claimed the camp's activities included lectures on Islam, football and paintballing. [...] In September 2006, following allegations that it was used in the training and recruitment of terrorists, police searched the school. [...] According to testimony <b>from</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> suspects held at the Guantanamo Bay detainment camp, in 1997 and 1998 Abu Hamza and groups of around 30of his followers held training camps at the school, which included training with AK47 rifles and handguns, and a mock rocket launcher. [...] No arrests were made, and students and faculty were allowed to return on 23 September 2006, the first day of Ramadan.|$|E
500|$|Amid the War on Terror {{and threat}} <b>from</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda,</b> Livingstone sought to build closer {{ties to the}} London's Muslim community, {{controversially}} agreeing to meet with Islamist groups like the Muslim Association of Britain alongside moderate organisations. In July 2004, he attended a conference discussing France's ban on the burka at which he talked alongside Islamist cleric Yusuf al-Qaradawi. Livingstone described al-Qaradawi as [...] "one of the most authoritative Muslim scholars in the world today" [...] and argued that his influence could help stop the radicalisation of young British Muslims. The move was controversial, with Jewish and LGBT organisations criticising Livingstone, citing al-Qaradawi's record of anti-Semitic and homophobic remarks, with the meeting leading to a publicised argument between Livingstone and his former supporter Peter Tatchell. Livingstone continued to champion the Palestinian cause in the Israel-Palestine conflict, in March 2005 accusing Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of being a [...] "war criminal" [...] responsible for the 1982 Sabra and Shatila massacre.|$|E

According to al-Bahri, bin Laden is hiding in the regions in Afghanistan or {{along the border with}} Pakistan. Malbrunot stated in an interview with Mark Colvin of PM that bin Laden is likely [...] "protected by tribes which are very loyal to him. These tribes, bin Laden has known them for the last 20 years. He help them financially and materially in the '80s and these tribes also, I think it's an important factor, are more loyal to the religion than to the typical tribal character, which mean that it's not very easy to bribe them."

5000|$|With {{money from}} {{extortion}} dwindling {{in areas like}} Mogadishu, defections {{in the face of}} AMISOM forces, among other internal issues, Al-Shabaab is turning to other militant Islamic groups for support. Al Shabaab has declared their support to bolster their numbers, and has made a number of strategic operational ties to both <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> and AQAP in Yemen. In some cases Al Shabaab has begun flying the Al Qeada-Iraq banner at some of its rallies to demonstrate solidarity with the group. There are signs that Al-Shabaab militants are learning <b>from</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda's</b> propaganda methods. [...] "Shabaab's propaganda has increasingly been slicked up to resemble messages produced by <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda's</b> 'As-Sahab' ('The Clouds') media wing and AQAP's Inspire magazine, including the release of rap songs by Omar Hammami." [...] It is unclear how the death of AQAP leader Anwar al-Aulaqi and others has affected this bourgeoning relationship between the two. As is evident by their merger with Hizb-ul-Islam in December 2010, Al-Shabaab is turning to former rivals for assistance as their numbers decrease due to defections and casualties directly resulting from battles with AMISOM forces.|$|R

Our only answer to this threat must be to contest and then to defeat it, and that is why we need this legislation." [...] David Davis said that there were many aspects of the bill which he could support unequivocally, but went on to criticise some of the uses of recent anti-terrorism legislation on trivial matters such as Walter Wolfgang. He concluded by saying that the Conservatives would support the second reading, but could not promise to support the third reading if changes were not made.|$|R
