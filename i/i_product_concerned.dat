40|$|Major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) class <b>I</b> <b>products</b> present pathogen-derived peptides to CD 8 + cytotoxic T cells. This interaction mediates the detection and clearance of intracellular infections. Emphasis {{has been placed}} on the critical role of classical class <b>I</b> MHC <b>products</b> in the development and function of CD 8 + T cells. In this thesis, I demonstrate that nonclassical class <b>I</b> <b>products</b> also {{play an important role in}} the development and function of CD 8 + T cells. Experiments using TAP 1 -/- or β 2 m-/- mice do not distinguish between the involvement of classical and nonclassical class <b>I</b> <b>products.</b> KbDb-/- mice are deficient in the expression of classical class <b>I</b> <b>products</b> but continue to express nonclassical class <b>I</b> <b>products,</b> providing a unique opportunity to examine the relative contributions of these types of molecules to immunity. Although the majority of CD 8 + T cells found in the periphery and female reproductive tract are dependent on classical class I for their development, a small but significant population of CD 8 + T cells are found in these tissues in the absence of classical class <b>I</b> <b>products.</b> These CD 8 + T cells, which mature in KbDb-/- but not β 2 m-/- mice, are therefore dependent on the expression of nonclassical class <b>I</b> <b>products</b> for their maturation. In contrast, the majority of CD 8 cαα+ TCRαβ intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (iIELs) develop independently of classical class I expression and are dependent on the nonclassical class <b>I</b> <b>product</b> Qa- 2 for their maturation. (cont.) The 2 C TCR has been described as restricted to the classical class <b>I</b> <b>product</b> Kb. However, we demonstrate that 2 C TCR+ T cells can develop in the absence of Kb molecules, but not in 2 m-/- mice, and therefore must require a nonclassical class <b>I</b> <b>product</b> for their maturation. These nonclassical class I-dependent 2 C T cells are found in fetal thymic organ cultures, neonatal thymi, and the intestine of adult mice. We also demonstrate that CD 8 + T cells restricted to nonclassical class <b>I</b> <b>products</b> provide full immunity against secondary lethal infections with Listeria monocytogenes. These nonclassically-restricted T cells expand disproportionately in KbDb-/- mice and are activated by Listeria-derived antigens presented by H- 2 M 3 and CD 1 d. by Dina Gould Halme. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Reports {{based on}} coprecipitation {{experiments}} {{have suggested that}} major histocompatibility complex class <b>I</b> <b>products</b> are complexed with the insulin receptor on the cell surface. Using an independent method that avoids the creation of immunoprecipitation artifacts during membrane solubilization, we have studied insulin receptor-class <b>I</b> <b>product</b> associations by determining the proximity between these class <b>I</b> <b>products</b> and the insulin receptor on intact cells {{with the use of}} fluorescence energy transfer. Significant energy transfer was seen between the insulin receptor and both murine H- 2 K- as well as H- 2 D-end products, indicating close proximity (e. g., within 10 nm). This cell-surface association is not from the relatively high class I density in that no significant energy transfer was measured between H- 2 K- vs. H- 2 D-end proteins. To extend these observations, we also tested whether class <b>I</b> <b>products</b> influence insulin-receptor binding and postbinding events {{as a result of their}} physical association. Using related cell lines positive and negative for class I expression, we found no correlation between insulin-receptor density or binding affinity with H- 2 product expression. The class I-null variant, however, demonstrated an increase in insulin-mediated insulin-receptor internalization to suggest that if major histocompatibility complex class <b>I</b> <b>products</b> directly affect insulin-receptor function through specific cell-surface interactions, they may do so after ligand binding...|$|R

I had an opportunity to review an article in the Friday, September 28, 2007, issue of the Santa Cruz Sentinel, which allegedly lists several of the components (ingredients) in the Checkmate products manufactured by Suterra and proposed or used by the California Secretary of Agriculture for aerial spraying to control the light brown apple moth. For the sake of the discussion here, I have commented on that list as well as information publicly available through Suterra’s website (specifically, the material data safety sheets or MSDSs and the technical data sheets for the Checkmate <b>products).</b> <b>I</b> am <b>concerned</b> that some of the materials reported by the Sentinel as components may in fact not be components, and I have noted this below.

40|$|Class <b>I</b> <b>products</b> of {{the major}} {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) comprise a heavy chain of about 45 kDa noncovalently linked to a 12 -kDa beta 2 -microglobulin (beta 2 m) light chain encoded on a different chromosome. We find that class <b>I</b> <b>products</b> of some mouse strains include an additional 62 -kDa molecule which on the following evidence consists of a heavy chain linked covalently with beta 2 m. Production of the 62 -kDa protein invariably accorded with the occurrence of cysteine at position 121 of the heavy chain (Kb,Kbm 1,Kbm 3,Dd, and Ld). Substitution of arginine at position 121 invariably accorded with absence of the 62 -kDa protein (Kbm 6,Kbm 7,Kbm 9,Kd, and Db). On the basis of observed production versus nonproduction of the 62 -kDa molecule, predictions are made regarding residue 121 in class <b>I</b> <b>products</b> for which this is not yet known; namely, Kk, Ks, and Dk, which produce the 62 -kDa molecule, as compared with Kj, Qa- 2, and TL, which do not.
