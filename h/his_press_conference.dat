5|$|The British press {{unanimously}} {{agreed that}} Arsenal were fortunate to win; Wenger himself admitted so in <b>his</b> <b>press</b> <b>conference</b> afterwards. A television audience of over 480million worldwide watched the final; in the United Kingdom, {{coverage of the}} match peaked at 12.8million, making it the highest-rated game in Cup history since the 1996 final. The departures of captains Patrick Vieira and Roy Keane before the year end, coupled with the changing objectives of both clubs, meant the 2005 final is considered as the natural end point in the rivalry between Arsenal and Manchester United under Ferguson and Wenger.|$|E

According to the Central Election Commission, passports had been copied {{in the context of a}} human resource program of the health ministry initiated in 2008 involving all medical personnel in Abkhazia, and the matter was thus unrelated to the election campaign.|$|E

The highly selective nature of the quotations and paraphrases has drawn considerable criticism from media commentators, politicians and the legal community. The Minister has also been criticised for failing to mention in his assessment any mention of source material that was supportive of Haneef's claims of innocence.|$|E
25|$|Since its formation, Jobbik had a {{strongly}} critical stance towards the European Union.

After the Brexit and the continuous debates {{on the future of the}} European Union, the party has reassessed its views on the EU and started to emphasize that by adequate policies a reform of the EU, that could make the organization advantageous for the European nations, is possible. According to Jobbik, Hungary should join the Eurozone as soon as possible since it is a not a political but an economic question. On <b>his</b> <b>press</b> <b>conference</b> on 27 October 2017 the president of the party, Gábor Vona told, if some conditions were fulfilled Jobbik could even support further deepening of the EU.|$|E

500|$|The {{significance}} of the fixture for the two clubs was increased by the fact that, had Arsenal avoided defeat, they would have extended their unbeaten league run to 50 matches. Wenger told reporters at <b>his</b> <b>press</b> <b>conference</b> that he felt no increased pressure, though added the team's midweek draw in the UEFA Champions League at Panathinaikos increased expectation. He admitted his team's behaviour in the fixture last season was unacceptable, but pointed out [...] "...the best response we gave was to win the fair play table. That meant we took responsibility for what we did and we have improved our attitude." [...] Wenger believed United's strengths lay in creativity, {{and did not want}} to set his team out to nullify, rather to [...] "...play our game based on speed and technique." ...|$|E

Of Bacary Sagna's move from Arsenal to Manchester City in the summer, Wenger told reporters: [...] "I made him a proposal to stay for three years, but he chose them. Had he chosen a long time ago?

500|$|St. Laurent {{was utterly}} {{confident}} {{of an election}} victory, {{so much so that}} he did not even bother to fill the sixteen vacancies in the Senate. He had been confident of re-election when Drew led the Tories, and, according to Liberal minister Lionel Chevrier, Diefenbaker's victory in the party leadership race increased his confidence by a factor of ten. At <b>his</b> <b>press</b> <b>conference</b> detailing his election tour, St. Laurent stated, [...] "I have no doubt about the election outcome." [...] He indicated that his campaign would open April 29 in Winnipeg, and that the Prime Minister would spend ten days in Western Canada before moving east. However, he indicated he would first go home to Quebec City for several days around Easter (April 21 in 1957). This break kept him out of the limelight for ten days at a time when Diefenbaker was already actively campaigning and making daily headlines. At a campaign stop in Jarvis, Ontario, St. Laurent told an aide that he was afraid the right-wing, anti-Catholic Social Credit Party would be the next Opposition. St. Laurent denied Opposition claims that he would resign after an election victory, and the 75-year-old indicated that he planned to run again in 1961, if he was still around.|$|E
