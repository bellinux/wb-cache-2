5|$|At {{both the}} 1999 and 2005 presidential elections, S. R. Nathan {{was elected by}} default as the only {{eligible}} candidate on nomination day. While {{being a member of}} a minority community worked to <b>his</b> <b>advantage,</b> he was unanimously endorsed by the 1999 Cabinet because of the merit of his overall qualities. Similarly, Nathan's decision to run for a second term in 2005 was accompanied by declarations of support from Government ministers and organizations like the NTUC.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, {{following}} the electoral {{defeat of the}} government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, ethnic tensions between Croats and Serbs worsened. Serbian President Slobodan Milošević used Franjo Tuđman's actions to <b>his</b> <b>advantage,</b> portraying the Croatian leader and his Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) as a reincarnation of the Ustaše, a fascist movement that had ruled Croatia during the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|Once {{he was a}} civilian, Mitchell {{assumed a}} {{prominent}} role in the “Save the Argylls” campaign. He wrote his memoirs (“Having Been a Soldier”), undertook some freelance journalism and briefly took a job as management trainee with Beaverbrook Newspapers. However, he had become a popular public figure and turned this to <b>his</b> <b>advantage</b> when he started a new career in politics.|$|E
5|$|Perrins' {{supporters}} had gambled {{heavily on}} {{him because of}} his reputation and <b>his</b> <b>advantage</b> in size. In the event it was a major supporter of Johnson, a Thomas Bullock, who gained; he won £20,000 (equivalent to £220,000 as of 2010) from his bets in favour of Johnson and gifted the victor £1,000.|$|E
5|$|An {{internal}} {{attempt was}} made to discredit Gomułka's leadership, but there were aspects of the ongoing witch hunt which he found to be to <b>his</b> <b>advantage</b> and he tolerated it until the societal damage wrecked by the Moczar movement had become irreversible. Gomułka's regime reasserted itself and was saved by a combination of international and domestic factors, including the Moczar faction's inability to take over the party and state apparatus. The Soviet Union, now led by Leonid Brezhnev, was preoccupied with the crisis in Czechoslovakia and not inclined to support personal changes in the Polish leadership.|$|E

5|$|At 5ft 4in (1.62m), Burnham was slight, but he {{was also}} muscular and bronzed, with a finely formed square jaw. He had a boyish {{appearance}} which he used to <b>his</b> <b>advantage</b> on numerous occasions. His most noticeable feature was his steady, grey-blue eyes. Contemporary reports had it that Burnham's gaze appeared to never leave those of the person he was looking at, and yet somehow could simultaneously monitor all the details of the physical surroundings. It was also said that Burnham's eyes possessed a far-away look such as those acquired by people whose occupation has caused them to watch continually at sea or on great plains.|$|E
5|$|Berzin first {{gained the}} race lead after the fourth stage where he {{attacked}} {{on the final}} climb to win the day. The race's overall classification was first headed by Endrio Leoni who won the Giro's opening road stage. However, Leoni lost the lead later that day during the afternoon individual time trial to Armand de Las Cuevas. De Las Cuevas held the lead for a single stage before losing it to Moreno Argentin who won the race's second stage. Argentin held the general classification lead for two stages, before Berzin took it after stage 4. After gaining the lead, Berzin began to build upon <b>his</b> <b>advantage</b> after winning the stage 8 and 18 individual time trials and maintaining good form throughout the mountains.|$|E
5|$|British Lt. Col. Robert Abercromby {{decided to}} push <b>his</b> <b>advantage</b> after {{scattering}} Irvine's troops. He pushed north and captured St. Thomas Episcopal Church, {{located on a}} hillock. Howe arrived a short while later, and ascended {{to the top of}} the church's bell tower in an attempt to view the American positions. Deciding the American defenses were too strong to attack with his present force, he opted to shell their defenses with artillery fire; however, his guns did not have the range to hit Washington's defenses. His forces camped on Chestnut Hill that night, and planned a new way of attack for the following day.|$|E

60|$|Gillian {{began to}} tremble {{inwardly}} again, but the game had just ended in her favour, owing to Fergus having lost all <b>his</b> <b>advantages</b> in Aunt Jane's absence, besides signalising himself by capturing Maura's 'bury,' {{under the impression that}} an additional R would combine that and straw into a fruit.|$|R
60|$|Raoul was earnest in his manner, {{and it was}} not {{possible}} to doubt his sincerity. Though an air of self-satisfaction gleamed in his face, when he alluded to his present personal appearance, for he well knew all <b>his</b> <b>advantages</b> in that way, in spite of the dress of a lazzarone.|$|R
5|$|Deligiannis mobilized the Hellenic Army, and the British Royal Navy {{blockaded}} Greece. The admiral {{in charge}} of the blockade was Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, who had been the first choice of the Greeks to be their king in 1863, and the First Lord of the Admiralty at the time was Lord Ripon, whose brother-in-law had been murdered in Greece 16 years before. This was not the last time that King George discovered that his family ties were not always to <b>his</b> <b>advantage.</b> Deligiannis was forced to demobilize and Trikoupis regained the premiership. Between 1882 and 1897, Trikoupis and Deligiannis alternated the premiership as their fortunes rose and fell.|$|E
5|$|During {{his second}} round match, O'Sullivan {{opened up a}} four frame {{advantage}} over Murphy in the first session to lead 6−2. In the second session, O'Sullivan maintained <b>his</b> <b>advantage</b> to lead 10−6 going into the final session. The third session saw no comeback from Murphy and O'Sullivan progressed to the quarter-finals 13−7. The quarter-finals would be the furthest O'Sullivan would progress, as he fell behind Ding Junhui 6–10 after the opening two sessions. Despite scoring the tournament's highest break with a 146 in the final session, he would eventually lose 10–13. Following his loss, O'Sullivan stated {{that he had no}} intention of retiring.|$|E
5|$|Ferrari's team orders {{caused them}} to be fined $100,000 by the race {{stewards}} but avoided further punishment from the FIA World Motor Sport Council in September 2010. The result meant Alonso reduced the points deficit to be 13 behind Vettel in the Drivers' Championship, while leader Lewis Hamilton extended <b>his</b> <b>advantage</b> over teammate Jenson Button by two points. Red Bull slightly reduced the deficit to McLaren in the Constructors' Championship, while Ferrari moved further ahead of Mercedes, with eight races left in the season.|$|E

60|$|As it was, however, {{he threw}} away <b>his</b> <b>advantages,</b> much as Tom Brown {{did at the}} {{beginning}} of his fight with Slogger Williams, and the result was the same as on that historic occasion. Mike had the greater strength, and, thirty seconds from the start, knocked his man clean off his feet with an unscientific but powerful right-hander.|$|R
5|$|Herrmann {{used the}} lowered music budget to <b>his</b> <b>advantage</b> by writing for a string {{orchestra}} {{rather than a}} full symphonic ensemble, contrary to Hitchcock's request for a jazz score. He thought of the single tone color of the all-string soundtrack {{as a way of}} reflecting the black-and-white cinematography of the film. The strings play con sordini (muted) for all the music other than the shower scene, creating a darker and more intense effect. Film composer Fred Steiner, in an analysis of the score to Psycho, points out that string instruments gave Herrmann access to a wider range in tone, dynamics, and instrumental special effects than any other single instrumental group would have.|$|E
5|$|In 1646, the Parliamentary Colonels John Birch and Robert Kyrle marched {{south from}} their {{successful}} Siege of Hereford and besieged the castle, {{with the aim}} of eliminating {{one of the few remaining}} Royalist strongholds. There was some personal animosity between Lingen and Birch, and both were outspoken, impulsive men. Birch's first move was to prevent further attacks from Lingen, and on 9March he burned the weakly defended stables in a surprise night attack, driving away the Royalist horses and temporarily denying the Royalist forces' mobility. Birch was unable to press home <b>his</b> <b>advantage</b> however, and over the next few months Lingen succeeded in replacing some of his horses and resumed his attacks on Parliamentary forces.|$|E
5|$|In the Battle of Neresheim (11 August 1796), Hotze {{commanded}} 13 battalions and 28 cavalry squadrons, a {{total of}} 13,300 men, and formed the center of Archduke Charles' line. Although Hotze's force managed to push the French out of several villages, his force was {{not strong enough to}} follow up on <b>his</b> <b>advantage.</b> Following the action at Neresheim, his force participated in the joint battles of Neumarkt and Lauf, followed by the Battle of Würzburg on 3 September 1796. During these consecutive actions, Hotze's organization and initiative led to the overwhelming of the French lines. For his actions in this campaign, he was awarded a promotion on 29 April 1797, and received the Commander's Cross of the Order of Maria Theresa.|$|E
60|$|Had Jimmy {{gone back}} to Lancashire, she {{admitted}} she might have married him. He had refused {{and for a time}} his obstinacy had hurt, but she was not revengeful and, since she had rather weighed <b>his</b> <b>advantages</b> than loved him, she could let it go. She liked Jimmy and was moved by a gentle sentimental tenderness.|$|R

500|$|Among <b>his</b> <b>advantages,</b> <b>his</b> move {{combinations}} {{contribute to}} his high mobility, {{compared to other}} Overwatch playable characters. Doomfist can easily reach and neutralize enemies occupying high ground, such as snipers. He is most effective against low-mobility opponents, but susceptible to high-mobility opponents, such as Pharah, Mercy, and Sombra. Among his disadvantages, Doomfist is dependent on his abilities to escape groups of enemies, leaving the player helpless when his abilities are unavailable (on cooldown). Doomfist's large [...] "hitbox", or area for taking damage, disadvantages him to characters such as Reaper, Roadhog, and Ana's sleep dart.|$|R
5|$|Jarrett {{used his}} {{strength}} against the 1–2–3 Kid {{in the following}} match. The Kid fought back with a spinning heel kick, but Jarrett regained control. Toward {{the end of the}} match, The Kid sustained a kayfabe injury to his knee. Jarrett tried to use this to <b>his</b> <b>advantage</b> by using the Figure Four leglock, but The Kid blocked the hold by using a small package to pin Jarrett for the victory. Upset at being eliminated from the tournament, Jarrett responded by performing three piledrivers on The Kid after the match.|$|E
5|$|Kenny Bräck won {{the pole}} {{position}} and maintained <b>his</b> <b>advantage</b> {{heading into the}} first lap. He led {{for a total of}} 134 laps, more than any other competitor. Franchitti employed a strategy that enabled him to drive in clean air while other drivers made pit stops. Bräck reclaimed the lead for the lap-163 restart, but lost it six laps later when a crew member dropped a wheel nut which cost him time. Franchitti took over the lead and held it {{for the remainder of the}} event to clinch the victory. It was Franchitti's third win of the season, his first on an oval track, and the tenth (and final) of his CART career. There were five cautions and nine lead changes during the course of the race.|$|E
5|$|The result meant Buemi {{remained}} the Drivers' Championship leader on 76 points, but <b>his</b> <b>advantage</b> over di Grassi was reduced from 29 points to five. Prost remained in third position on 46 points while Vergne's second-place finish {{allowed him to}} be six points in arrears of the French driver. Bird's third-place result enabled him to move ahead of Rosenqvist for fifth. Audi Sport ABT's result allowed them to reduce the gap to Teams' Championship leaders e.Dams-Renault to 31 points behind the team. Virgin and Techeetah (on 43 and 41 points respectively) moved ahead of Mahindra with eight rounds left in the season.|$|E
