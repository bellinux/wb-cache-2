50|$|IPDI {{exists in}} two {{stereoisomer}}s, cis and trans. Their reactivities are similar. Each stereoisomer is an unsymmetrical molecule, and thus has isocyanate groups with different reactivities.

50|$|The {{isocyanate}} functional {{groups in}} TDI react with hydroxyl groups to form carbamate (urethane) links. The two isocyanate groups in TDI react at different rates: The 4-position is approximately {{four times more}} reactive than the 2-position. 2,6-TDI is a symmetrical molecule and thus has two isocyanate groups of similar reactivity, similar to the 2-position on 2,4-TDI. However, since both isocyanate groups {{are attached to the}} same aromatic ring, reaction of one <b>isocyanate</b> <b>group</b> will cause a change in the reactivity of the second <b>isocyanate</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E
50|$|Isocyanates {{should not}} be {{confused}} with cyanate esters and isocyanides, whose behaviors are very different. The cyanate (cyanate ester) functional group (R-O-C≡N) is arranged differently from the <b>isocyanate</b> <b>group</b> (R-N=C=O). Isocyanides have the connectivity R-N≡C, lacking the oxygen of the cyanate groups.|$|E

In 4,4'-MDI, the two <b>isocyanate</b> <b>groups</b> are equivalent but in 2,4'-MDI the two groups display highly differing reactivities. The group at the 4-position is approximately four times more reactive than the group at the 2-position due to steric hindrance.|$|R

In one example, the dendrons with the deblocked isocyanates further reacted with stearyl alcohol (C 18 -OH) {{to form the}} corresponding dendrons presenting C 18 moieties.

50|$|The {{structure}} of CSI is represented as ClS(O)2-N=C=O. It {{consists of two}} electron-withdrawing components, the chlorosulfonyl group (SO2Cl) and the <b>isocyanate</b> <b>group</b> (-N=C=O). Because of its resulting electrophilicity, the use of CSI in chemical synthesis requires relatively inert solvents such as chlorocarbons, acetonitrile, and ethers.|$|E
50|$|Isocyanate is the {{functional}} {{group with the}} formula R-N=C=O. Organic compounds that contain an <b>isocyanate</b> <b>group</b> {{are referred to as}} isocyanates. An isocyanate that has two isocyanate groups is known as a di-isocyanate. Di-isocyanates are manufactured for reactions with polyols in the production of polyurethanes, a class of polymers.|$|E
50|$|This {{rotation}} {{takes place}} in five steps. The amine group present on the triptycene moiety is converted to an <b>isocyanate</b> <b>group</b> by condensation with phosgene (a). Thermal or spontaneous rotation around the central bond then brings the <b>isocyanate</b> <b>group</b> in proximity of the hydroxyl group located on the helicene moiety (b), thereby allowing these two groups to react with each other (c). This reaction irreversibly traps {{the system as a}} strained cyclic urethane that is higher in energy and thus energetically closer to the rotational energy barrier than the original state. Further rotation of the triptycene moiety therefore requires only a relatively small amount of thermal activation in order to overcome this barrier, thereby releasing the strain (d). Finally, cleavage of the urethane group restores the amine and alcohol functionalities of the molecule (e).|$|E

50|$|Isocyanates {{used to make}} {{polyurethane}} {{have two}} or more <b>isocyanate</b> <b>groups</b> on each molecule. The most commonly used isocyanates are the aromatic diisocyanates, toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate, MDI.|$|R
2500|$|Isocyanates {{are very}} {{reactive}} materials. This makes them useful in making polymers but also requires special care in handling and use. [...] The aromatic isocyanates, diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) or toluene diisocyanate (TDI) are more reactive than aliphatic isocyanates, such as hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) or isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI). Most of the isocyanates are difunctional, that {{is they have}} exactly two <b>isocyanate</b> <b>groups</b> per molecule. An important exception to this is polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate, which {{is a mixture of}} molecules with two, three, and four or more <b>isocyanate</b> <b>groups.</b> In cases like this the material has an average functionality greater than two, commonly 2.7.|$|R
50|$|Isothiocyanate is the {{chemical}} group -N=C=S, formed by substituting the {{oxygen in the}} <b>isocyanate</b> <b>group</b> with a sulfur. Many natural isothiocyanates from plants are produced by enzymatic conversion of metabolites called glucosinolates. These natural isothiocyanates, such as allyl isothiocyanate, are also known as mustard oils. An artificial isothiocyanate, phenyl isothiocyanate, is used for amino acid sequencing in the Edman degradation.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the other reactions described above, this reaction does not involve activation of a C-C double or triple bond by gold. In a simple mechanistic picture, gold(I) simultaneously coordinates to two phosphine ligands and the carbon <b>isocyanate</b> <b>group</b> [...] which is then attacked by the carbonyl group. Further studies on the bonding mode of Au(I) indicate that this simple picture {{may have to be}} revised.|$|E
5000|$|The word {{polyurea}} {{is derived}} from the Greek words πολυ- - poly- meaning [...] "many"; and ουρίας - oûron meaning [...] "to urinate". The latter term refers to the substance urea, found in urine, rather than urine itself. Urea or carbamide is an organic compound with the chemical formula (NH2)2CO. The molecule has two amine groups (-NH2) joined by a carbonyl functional group (C=O). In a polyurea, alternating monomer units of isocyanates and amines react with each other to form urea linkages. Ureas can also be formed from the reaction of isocyanates and water which forms a carbamic acid intermediate. This acid quickly decomposes by splitting off carbon dioxide and leaving behind an amine. This amine then reacts with another <b>isocyanate</b> <b>group</b> to form the polyurea linkage. This two step reaction is used in what is commonly but improperly called polyurethane foams. The carbon dioxide that is liberated in this reaction is the primary blowing (foaming) agent especially in many polyurethane foams which more precisely should be called polyurethane/urea foams.|$|E
40|$|In {{our earlier}} study, {{we showed that}} the surface {{hydroxyl}} groups of hydroxyapatite {{have the ability to}} react with organic <b>isocyanate</b> <b>groups.</b> In this study, the feasibility of grafting poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), poly(n-butyl methacrylate) (PBMA), and Poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) [poly(HEMA) ] by using the reaction of <b>isocyanate</b> <b>groups</b> with the hydroxyl groups on the surface of HA was investigated. Double bonds were introduced to the surface of HA via the coupling reaction of isocyanateoethyl methacrylate (ICEM) with HA, or through hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDI) with hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and HA, followed by radical polymerization in MMA, BMA, or HEMA. Infrared spectra indicated the existence of polymers on the surfaces of HA. Thermogravimetric analysis also confirmed the presence of grafted polymers on the surface of HA powder particles (20 - 26 wt%). The polymers gave typical PMMA, PBMA, or poly(HEMA) infrared spectra, with the exception of amide bands, a result of the coupling reaction of ICEM or HMDI with hydroxy groups of HA or HEMA. Therefore it is concluded that the polymers were chemically bonded to the surface of HA through the <b>isocyanate</b> <b>groups</b> of ICEM or HMDI...|$|R

MDI is toxic and after application uncured isocyanates can cause eye and lung irritation, and chemical sensitization when absorbed through the skin [6].

Substituted aromatics containing electron withdrawing groups further increase the reactivity of isocyanates by increasing the partial positive charge on the isocyanate carbon via a resonance withdrawing effect.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the rate of}} the activated anionic polymerisation of ε-caprolactam (CL) onto 3 -isopropenyl-α,α-dimethylbenzyl isocyanate bearing PP (PP-g-TMI) in the melt to form a graft copolymer with PP as backbone and PA 6 as grafts. The polymerisation was catalysed by sodium ε-caprolactam (NaCL). The PP-g-TMI/NaCL/CL polymerisation system being heterogeneous, the polymerisation was carried out in a batch mixer. Emphasis was placed on the effects of temperature and the concentrations of NaCL and the <b>isocyanate</b> <b>group</b> in the form of PP-g-TMI on the polymerisation rate. Results suggested that if the polymerisation is to be carried out by a reactive extrusion process whose mean residence time is less than a few minutes, it is recommended that the polymerisation temperature be higher than 220 °C. Moreover, the molar ratio between NaCL and CL should be higher than 0. 5 {{and at the same time}} that between the <b>isocyanate</b> <b>group</b> in the form of PP-g-TMI and NaCL, should be smaller than 4...|$|E

40|$|Isocyanates, a {{group of}} low {{molecular}} weight aromatic and aliphatic compounds possesses the functional <b>isocyanate</b> <b>group.</b> They are highly toxic in nature hence; we used N-succinimidyl N-methylcarbamate (NSNM), a surrogate chemical containing a functional <b>isocyanate</b> <b>group</b> to understand the mode of action of this class of compounds. We employed budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism to study the pathways targeted by NSNM. Our screening with yeast mutants revealed that it affects chromatin, DNA damage response, protein-ubiquitylation and chaperones, oxidative stress, TOR pathway and DNA repair processes. We also show that NSNM acts as an epigenetic modifier as its treatment causes reduction in global histone acetylation and formation of histone adducts. Cells treated with NSNM exhibited increase in mitochondrial membrane potential as well as intracellular ROS levels and the effects were rescued by addition of reduced glutathione to the medium. We also report that deletion of SOD 1 and SOD 2, the superoxide dismutase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae displayed hypersensitivity to NSNM. Furthermore, NSNM treatment causes rapid depletion of total glutathione and reduced glutathione. We also demonstrated that NSNM induces degradation of Sml 1, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor involved in regulating dNTPs production. In summary, we define the various biological pathways targeted by isocyanates...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGenerally, the {{flexible}} polyurethane foams were synthesized by mainly petroleum-based polyols. In this present study, Caradol SA 34 - 05 (petroleum-based polyol) {{was replaced by}} Emerox® 14001 (natural oil-based polyol) with 0 - 50 wt% replacement to prepare flexible polyurethane foam by one shot method. The NCO index (NCO equivalent/OH equivalent) was fixed at 1. 00. The characteristic times such as cream time, gel time, rise time and tack free time were followed during cup test. The physical properties were characterized and studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and foam density. The tensile and compression properties were investigated by UTM machine. The {{results show that the}} foam density decreased with increasing Emerox® 14001 contents up to 20 wt% replacement and then decreased. This trandency was similar to tensile modulus, compressive modulus and compressive strength results. The cell size of foams was important parameter to control their properties. However, tensile strength and elongation at break were enhanced by the addition of Emerox® 14001 at 20 wt% contents replacement and then decreased at higher content. Both parameters rely on balance between urethane linkages and urea microdomain and/or polyurea ball contents(urea aggregate), which were rapidly generated by <b>isocyanate</b> <b>group</b> and water. The increased Emerox® 14001 contents required more isocyanate. As a result, more urea microdomain were produced leading to the decreasing of tensile strength and elongation at break. Moreover, the compression set of the foams was dependent upon amount of urea linkages which was generated from the reaction of <b>isocyanate</b> <b>group</b> and water...|$|E

We found that carbonyl biscaprolactam and its derivatives couple polymer chains in a strictly linear fashion.

The breakthrough to produce a wide variety of novel polymers came when we found that many building blocks, provided with functional <b>groups</b> and blocked <b>isocyanate</b> <b>groups,</b> could be {{made on the basis of}} this chemistry. Blocked <b>isocyanate</b> <b>groups</b> are very suitable coupling units to fix desired functions onto polymer backbones. In one example, antifouling coatings were prepared by introducing fluorine groups. In another case, blocked isocyanate functional acrylates were built into a polyacrylate to make self-crosslinkable coatings. In another illustration, the concept was demonstrated by a novel route to prepare polyrotaxanes from rotaxane monomers provided with blocked isocyanates as polymerizable stopper groups. These reactive functional compounds gave, in a controlled manner, polymeric materials with substantially improved properties. ...|$|R

Coating applications of this unique building block are not restricted to these perfect branching polymers, but also include isocyanate-functional coating resins.
