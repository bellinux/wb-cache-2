Hawking, who is paralyzed due to neuro-muscular dystrophy, is seen sitting in his wheelchair. After the camera cuts, Hawking then jumps up from his chair, and admits it <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> act, before deciding to go surfing at the nearby beach.|$|E
5|$|Sia {{is one of}} them. She comes in, singer-songwriter, {{she just}} writes the most {{beautiful}} amazing ballads. Now she is making a name for herself on a more broad commercial scale {{with a lot of}} more dance-driven stuff, and she <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> incredible singer. She came in and she just writes such serious songs, I was like 'Oh she is gunna be such a serious person, and I'm nervous to meet her, and I just want her to get me and understand that I'm not a cheesy pop star'. She comes in and she was all nervous, and she is the most bubbliest person in the world, but once she starts singing and getting into her thing, you're just sucked into this world of 'wow' and it's inspiring to be around people with such creative energy. I love that, that's the best experience.|$|E
5|$|After {{watching}} a dinosaur show at an arena in Springfield, Lisa discovers {{one of her}} favorite authors, T. R. Francis, working there in a dinosaur costume. The woman reveals to a shocked Lisa that she <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> actress the book publishing company used for the jacket photos, and that T. R. Francis is a complete fabrication. She further reveals that all popular young-adult book series were never each written by a single author with any inspiration, they are conceived by book publishing executives through market research and the use of multiple ghostwriters, just to make more money. When Homer finds out about this, he decides to get rich by group-writing a fantasy novel. He recruits a team consisting of Bart, Principal Skinner, Patty Bouvier, Moe Szyslak, and Professor Frink, all of whom have personal attributes or experiences that will help with writing the book: Skinner knows what teens like, Patty is a fantasy fiction fan, Moe has already published some children's books, and Frink has a computer. Lisa is shocked to find that they are group-writing a book, as she knows the only reason one would do that is to gain money. To show that what they are doing is wrong, she decides to write a novel on her own with a personal story that readers will connect with.|$|E

5|$|Philosopher Taede Smedes {{argued that}} {{religious}} language is symbolic. Denying any conflict {{between science and}} religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept a conviction (that God exists, {{in the context of}} Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things that we do not know for sure. Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world {{that there can be no}} common standard to which both God and the world can be compared. He argues that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently). Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God pro nobis (for us) and not in se (as such) or sine nobis (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.|$|E

25|$|As noted above, {{the status}} of APD as a {{distinct}} disorder has been queried, especially by speech-language pathologists and psychologists, who note the overlap between clinical profiles of children diagnosed with APD and those with other forms of specific learning disability. Many audiologists, however, would dispute that APD <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> alternative label for dyslexia, SLI, or ADHD, noting that although it often co-occurs with these conditions, {{it can be found}} in isolation.|$|E

25|$|Tom Bombadil {{is not an}} {{important}} person—to the narrative. I suppose he has some importance as a 'comment.'

I would not, however, have left him in, {{if he did not}} have some kind of function.|$|E

When these files are accessed, the search is run with the saved query string and the results presented as a virtual folder. Windows Vista also supports query composition, where a saved search (called a scope) can be nested within the query string of another search.|$|E
25|$|Prospective {{studies have}} many {{benefits}} over case control studies. The RR {{is a more}} powerful effect measure than the OR, as the OR <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> estimation of the RR, since true incidence cannot be calculated in a case control study where subjects are selected based on disease status. Temporality can be established in a prospective study, and confounders are more easily controlled for. However, they are more costly, {{and there is a}} greater chance of losing subjects to follow-up based on the long time period over which the cohort is followed.|$|E
25|$|Predictions {{of quantum}} {{mechanics}} have been verified experimentally to an extremely high degree of accuracy. for some atomic properties. According to the correspondence principle between classical and quantum mechanics, all objects obey the laws {{of quantum mechanics}}, and classical mechanics <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> approximation for large systems of objects (or a statistical quantum mechanics of a large collection of particles). The laws of classical mechanics thus follow from the laws of quantum mechanics as a statistical average at the limit of large systems or large quantum numbers. However, chaotic systems do not have good quantum numbers, and quantum chaos studies the relationship between classical and quantum descriptions in these systems.|$|E

25|$|Anna's {{fighting}} {{style is}} based on Hapkido, a martial art that {{is known for its}} efficient joint locks, throws, and pressure point strikes and timed defensive tactics. Despite this, she and Nina have both incorporated other fighting arts into their personal styles. She begins sharing mostly the same moveset with Nina, but has developed her own moveset overtime to the point that as of Tekken 5, she only shares several moves with Nina and even then they have different properties. Anna's grappling moves have also changed over the series, reflecting less of her bone breaking martial arts. In Tekken 3, Anna only appears as a playable character in the console version; in the arcade version, she <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> alternate costume for Nina, and therefore has the same exact moveset as her sister.|$|E

He acts like he swallowed a blade so he can see Thenmozhi once before going to jail. He is {{rushed to the hospital}} sees her and fools the entire police force even though Baby is quite suspicious. Kumbudren Samy tries to bribe the doctor to lie but she tells the police constable who only pleads with the him but later gives up and releases him. Actor Suriya attends a school function in the town to promote educational awareness through his Agaram Foundation. Just as he is about to leave the Zamindar requests him to stay and witness Walter's acting skills, who shows off his depictions of the nine emotions (Navarasas) and impresses everyone, including Kumbedren Samy. The drunk Kumbredren Samy then reveals to the drunk Zamindar that he actually does love his brother and that all the anger and hate it <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> act.|$|E

The word implies, in fact, supernatural or superhuman power, like Beowulf's gift from God of [...] "thirtyfold strength".
