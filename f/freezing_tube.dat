5000|$|In 1991 Bill Mumy {{provided}} [...] "Alpha Control Guidance" [...] for a Lost in Space {{revival in}} comic book form Lost in Space comic book for Innovation Comics, writing {{six of the}} issues. The first officially licensed comic {{to be based on}} the TV series (as the previous Gold Key version was based on the 1962 concept), the series was set several years after the show. The kids were now teenagers, with Will at 16 years old, and the stories attempted to return the series to its straight adventure roots with one story even explaining the camp / farce episodes of the series as fanciful entries in Penny's Space Diary. Complex adult-themed story concepts were introduced and even included a love triangle developing between Penny, Judy and Don. Mark Goddard wrote a [...] "Don" [...] story, something he never had in the original series (with the possible exception of [...] "the Flaming Planet" [...] which might qualify as a [...] "Don" [...] episode). The Jupiter 2 had various interior designs in the first year as artists were obviously not familiar with the original layout of the ship while Michal Dutkiewicz got it 'spot-on'. The first year had an arc ultimately leading the travelers to Alpha Centauri with Smith contacting his former alien masters along the way. Aeolis 14 Umbra were furious with Smith for not having succeeded in his mission to prevent the Jupiter 2, built with technology from a crashed ship of their race, from reaching the star system they had claimed as their own. The year ended with Smith caught out for his traitorous associations and imprisoned in a <b>freezing</b> <b>tube</b> for the Jupiters final journey to the Promised Planet. Year two was to be Mumy's own full season story of a complex adventure following the Robinson's arrival at their destination and capture by the Aoleans. Innovation folded in 1993 with the story only halfway through and it wasn't until 2005 that Mumy was able to present his story to Lost in Space fandom as a complete graphic novel via Bubblehead Publishing. The theme of an adult Will Robinson was also explored in the film and in the song [...] "Ballad of Will Robinson"—written and recorded by Mumy.|$|E

Cryopreservation is a method for long-term storage of healthy teeth which were removed for orthodontic reasons or due to traumatic origin. These preserved teeth can be used as autogenous replants or transplants after tooth loss. During transport to and from the freezing facilities prior to freezing the teeth are stored in a cell culture medium. The tooth is transferred into a <b>freezing</b> <b>tube</b> containing cell culture medium and cryoprotectant DMSO. Teeth autotransplanted after cryopreservation show vitality of the PDL cells.

40|$|To {{offer for}} potable water shortages, sea water {{desalination}} {{is a potential}} solution for the global rising demand for fresh water. The {{latent heat of fusion}} is about one-seventh the latent heat of vaporisation, thus indicating the benefit of lower energy consumption for the freeze desalination process. Limited literature is reported on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) on freeze desalination. Therefore, analysing and investigating thermodynamic processes are easily conducted by the powerful tool of CFD. A single unit of ice formation in an ice maker machine was modelled using ANSYS Fluent software three-dimensionally. Energy, species transport and solidification/melting modules were used in building the CFD model. Parametric analysis was conducted using the established CFD model to predict the effects of freezing temperature and the geometry of the ice maker machine; on ice production and the freezing time. Lower freezing temperatures allowed more ice production and faster freezing. Increasing the diameter and the length of the <b>freezing</b> <b>tube</b> enabled more ice to be produced...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} solve the water sealing problem of soil between pipes of long {{distance}} curved pipe-jacked technology, Freeze-Sealing Pipe Roof (FSPR) as an innovative pre-supporting method in tunnel engineering is being applied to the Gongbei Tunnel in the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge. The definition of FSPR is that large diameter steel pipes are {{laid out in a}} circle around the cross section of tunnel in advance, then the artificial ground freezing method is adopted to freeze soil between steel pipes to form water-sealing curtain. An effective freeze control system, which contains master <b>freezing</b> <b>tubes,</b> enhancing <b>freezing</b> <b>tubes</b> and limiting <b>freezing</b> <b>tubes,</b> is established for building up the frozen soil curtain, maintaining its stability during excavation and controlling the volume of frozen soil to limit frost heave dynamically. An in-situ test was carried out to explore the optimal freezing scheme and control mode. The results of the test show that the principal freezing scheme of the solid pipe with hollow pipe as a complement is the most optimal scheme in active freezing phase of the real construction. Meanwhile, cold control mode is suggested to control frost heave in maintained freezing phase. The conclusions have important guiding significance for this kind of engineering construction...|$|R

The completed facility contained the 400-meter oval skating track, which surrounded two international size hockey ice sheets. Under the ice sheets and track are 33 mi of <b>freeze</b> <b>tubes</b> which keep the concrete base at 18 F year-round.

40|$|Frozen {{fraction}} measurements {{made using}} a droplet free-fall <b>freezing</b> <b>tube</b> apparatus are presented and used, {{along with other}} recent laboratory measurements, to evaluate how well both the water activity idea and the translated melting-point curve idea of Koop et al. predict homogeneous freezing-point temperatures for aqueous ammonium sulfate and sulfuric acid solution droplets. The new freezing-point temperature datasets agree with the previous lowest-temperature results for both solutes. The lowest measured freezing-point temperatures for aqueous ammonium sulfate solutions agree with a curve shaped like the translated melting-point curve. However, those for aqueous sulfuric acid solutions are significantly lower than predicted by the translated melting-point curve idea, and a single water activity freezing-point temperature curve does not represent the lowest-temperature freezing-point temperature data for both solutes. A linear extrapolation of the new aqueous sulfuric acid solution freezing data to low temperatures predicts that high critical super-saturations in cloud-free regions of the upper troposphere will occur when homogeneous ice nucleation in an aqueous sulfuric acid aerosol is the primary ice formation mechanism. 1...|$|E
40|$|We have {{measured}} the light scattering intensity and homogeneous ice nucleation temperatures from water droplets containing 0 - 33 wt % ammonium sulfate.

We find freezing temperatures in good agreement with the lowest temperature freezing results reported by previous experiments. Our ammonium sulfate freezing temperature data set with water activity less than 0. 98 is consistent with a curve that deviates in activity shift by about 5 % from the best-fit ice nucleation temperature versus water activity curve found by Koop et al. in 2000, but the significance of this deviation will only be known with further high-precision ice nucleation temperature measurements for other aqueous solutions. 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEven though {{studies of}} Arctic ice forming {{particles}} {{suggest that a}} bacterial or viral source derived from open leads could be important for cloud formation in the Arctic (Bigg and Leck, 2001), the ice nucleation potential of most polar marine psychrophiles or viruses has not been examined under conditions more closely resembling those in the atmosphere. In this paper, we examined the ice nucleation activity (INA) of several representative Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice bacterial isolates and a polar Colwellia phage virus. High-resolution ice nucleation spectra were obtained for droplets containing bacterial cells or virus particles using a free-fall <b>freezing</b> <b>tube</b> technique. The fraction of frozen droplets at a particular droplet temperature was determined by measuring the depolarized light scattering intensity from solution droplets in free-fall. Our experiments revealed that all sea-ice isolates and the virus nucleated ice at temperatures {{very close to the}} homogeneous nucleation temperature for the nucleation medium ? which for artificial seawater was ? 42. 2 ± 0. 3 °C. Our results indicated that these marine psychro-active bacteria and viruses are not important for heterogeneous ice nucleation processes in sea ice or polar clouds. These results also suggested that avoidance of ice formation in close proximity to cell surfaces might be one of the cold-adaptation and survival strategies for sea-ice bacteria. The fact that INA occurs at such low temperature could constitute one factor that explains the persistence of metabolic activities at temperatures far below the freezing point of seawater...|$|E

50|$|The Ice Sheet at Ogden {{is located}} 35 mi north of {{downtown}} Salt Lake City {{on the campus of}} Weber State University in Ogden, Utah. Following the passage of Utah's 1989 Olympic referendum, Ogden submitted a proposal to the Utah Sports Authority and Utah's Olympic organizers to construct an Olympic sized practice ice sheet in the city. On September 10, 1990, the Utah Sports Authority, selected a site near the Dee Events Center in Ogden as the site of an Olympic ice sheet, over other locations in downtown Salt Lake City and Provo, Utah. The property for the venue would be leased from Weber State University for 50 years at a cost of $1. A groundbreaking ceremony at the start of construction was held December 17, 1992. The facility was to cost $5.9 million, with $3 million coming from the State of Utah (as authorized in the 1989 Olympic referendum), $2 million from Weber County, and the remainder from private donations.

40|$|For decades, drop-freezing {{instruments}} {{have contributed}} {{to a better understanding}} of biological ice nucleation and its likely implications for cloud and precipitation development. Yet, current instruments have limitations. Drops analysed on a cold stage are subject to evaporation and potential contamination. The use of closed tubes provides a partial solution to these problems, but freezing events are still difficult to be clearly detected. Here, we present a new apparatus where <b>freezing</b> in closed <b>tubes</b> is detected automatically by a change in light transmission upon ice development, caused by the formation of air bubbles and crystal facets that scatter light. Risks of contamination and introduction of biases linked to detecting the freezing temperature of a sample are then minimized. To illustrate the performance of the new apparatus we show initial results of two assays with snow samples. In one, we repeatedly analysed the sample (208 tubes) over the course of a month with storage at + 4 °C, during which evidence for biological ice nucleation activity emerged through an increase in the number of ice nucleators active around − 4 °C. In the second assay, we indicate the possibility of increasingly isolating a single ice nucleator from a precipitation sample, potentially determining the nature of a particle responsible for a nucleation activity measured directly in the sample. These two seminal approaches highlight the relevance of this handy apparatus for providing new points of view in biological ice nucleation research...|$|R
50|$|The {{process begins}} when surface water nucleates around {{irregularities}} where it meets the container wall and freezes inward. If the c-axis {{of the first}} crystal to form is not vertical, the basal plane intersects the surface along a line perpendicular to the c-axis and ice needles tend to propagate across the surface along this line. At {{the same time a}} curtain of ice grows down into the supercooled water along the basal plane. As the film of ice grows to cover most of the surface the crystals merge and become fixed rigidly in place and the sheet of ice continues freezing towards the middle until only a small hole remains unfrozen. The crystallite curtains tend to join at an angle of 60 degrees and so the hole is often triangular, although other geometric shapes are possible. The continuing expansion of the ice downwards into the water then squeezes the remaining water up through the hole and a convex meniscus is formed which bulges slightly higher than the surface of the ice. As the edges of the meniscus freeze they create a small dam which causes the water to rise higher and as it expands above the ice dam the edges freeze again to form another dam on top of the first one. If the rate of expansion of the water {{is the same as the}} rate of freezing at the lip of the hole then this process is continually repeated and successive layers form a tube of ice. The growth of the tube continues in this way until the tip seals over or until all the water is frozen. The formation of ice spikes is related to the shape of the water body, the concentration of dissolved impurities, air temperature and air circulation above the water. Spikes that grow from a crystallite formed below the surface of the water may project from the ice sheet at a steep angle, rather than perpendicular to it.Small ice spikes can be formed artificially on ice cubes produced in domestic refrigerators using distilled water in plastic ice cube trays. The formation of the spike is similar to that of the naturally occurring spike in that the expansion of interior water and the reduction of volume in the interior of the cube increase the pressure on the water pushing it upward through the hole. The growth of the tube ceases when the drop at the top of the <b>tube</b> <b>freezes</b> entirely, which is substantially before the rest of the water in the cube is frozen. This method produces small spikes which are usually round or triangular in cross section with sharp tips. Experiments using this method have been carried out in laboratory settings but it has been found that spikes are less likely to form in ice cubes made from non-distilled water as impurities in the water inhibit spike formation. This poses the question of how naturally occurring ice spikes form in tapwater or rainwater and Libbrecht and Lui have suggested that, in the case of the small spikes grown in a refrigerator, impurities will become increasingly concentrated in the small unfrozen droplet at the top of the <b>tube</b> reducing the <b>freezing</b> rate and so the growth of the tube. However, they believe that on the rare occasions when exceptionally large spikes grow in natural, outdoor ice formations, some other mechanism must remove the impurities that build up at the top of the growing tube. Either impurities may be forced into pockets that freeze more slowly, or perhaps a convective flow, which would be insignificant in the smaller, artificially grown spikes, replaces the water at the top of the tube with fresh water from below.|$|R
40|$|Authors: Ole Audun Haabeth, Bjarne Bogen & Alexandre Corthay ### Abstract Cytokines {{represent}} {{a diverse group}} of soluble proteins that {{play a key role in}} a number of physiological processes, including regulation of both the innate and adaptive immune responses. Cytokines are generally secreted in small amounts, and are relatively unstable. Therefore, detection and measurement of cytokine local concentrations in a tissue extracellular matrix can be challenging. To investigate cytokines involved in cancer prevention by tumour-specific CD 4 + T cells, we have developed a strategy consisting of embedding subcutaneously injected tumour cells in a collagen gel (Matrigel) [1]. Matrigel is a soluble basement membrane isolated from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swan (EHS) tumour [2]. This extract resembles the complex extracellular environment found in many tissues. The Matrigel is liquid at 4 °C but when incubated at room temperature, the Matrigel proteins self-assemble forming a gel plug. In short, the Matrigel functions as an extracellular matrix in which infiltrating immune cells [3] and secreted cytokines can be analyzed at various time points after s. c. injections [1]. ### Reagents 1. Cold sterile Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS 14040 - 117, Gibco) - Ice-cold liquid growth factor reduced Matrigel (356231, BD Biosciences) - RPMI 1640 cell culture medium (61870, Gibco) - Collagenase IV from Clostridium histolyticum (C 5138, Sigma-Aldrich) - Deoxyribonuclease I from bovine pancreas (D 5025, Sigma-Aldrich) - 70 % Ethanol - Hypno/dormicum: hypnorm (Janssen Pharmaceutica) and midazolam (Alpharma) 7. 5 mg/kg. - Tryptan blue solution 0. 4 % (T 8154, Sigma-Aldrich) ### Equipment 1. 50 ml centrifuge tubes (430829, CORNING) - Scissors - Petri dish, TC dish 60 × 15 Nuncleon D SI (150326, NUNC) - Stainless steel sieve with screens for CD- 1, size 60 mesh (CD 1 - 1 KT, Sigma-Aldrich) - 1. 5 ml Eppendorf tubes (72. 690. 00. 1 SARSTEDT) - 2 ml syringe (2015 - 10, BD Biosciences) - 1 ml syringe (2015 - 07, BD Biosciences) - 0. 6 mm x 25 mm needle (2015 - 05, BD Biosciences) - Acrodisc 25 mm Syringe filter with 0. 45 µm HT + Tuffryn membrane (2012 - 05, PALL) - Centrifuge (HAERUS MULTIFUGE 3 SR+, THERMO SCIENTIFIC) - Count slide (87144, KOVA) - Pipettes - **Note**: Before use, Matrigel should be thawed slowly at a low heat level (e. g. overnight in the fridge at + 4 °C). Keep the Matrigel, the tumour cells and all the equipment cold (+ 4 °C). Remember that the Matrigel solution is liquid at + 4 °C but that it gels at room temperature. ### Procedure **Injection of Tumour Cells in Matrigel**: 1. Wash the cancer cells 1 X in sterile ice cold PBS. - Count cells. Adjust to a suitable concentration, e. g. 4 × 10 e 6 /ml. - Anesthetize the mice with hypno/dormicum intraperitoneally or subcutaneously. - Mix on ice 1125 µl Matrigel + 125 µl tumour cells (i. e. 10 X dilution). - Inject, subcutaneously, carefully 250 µl ice-cold tumour cell/Matrigel solution using a 1 ml syringe with a 0. 6 mm x 25 mm needle (This will give 10 e 5 cancer cells per Matrigel plug if the original concentration was 4 × 10 e 6 /ml). **Preparation of Matrigel samples for extracellular matrix cytokine detection and flow cytometry analysis**: - **Note**: During the whole procedure, keep samples on ice as much as possible. 1. Sacrifice the mice - From each mouse, dissect carefully the Matrigel plug and transfer it into a 50 ml tube with 1 ml cell medium RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0. 3 mg/ml DNase and 1 mg/ml collagenase IV. - Cut the Matrigel plug in small pieces using sterile scissors. - Put sample on ice. - Clean dissection equipment and scissors between each mouse. - Go back to step two until all Matrigel plugs are collected. - Place the tubes in a water bath for 30 minutes at 37 °C. - After 30 minutes, place the samples on ice and keep them on ice as much as possible. - Mesh the Matrigel samples through a stainless-steel sieve onto the lid of a 5 cm Petri dish, and transfer the solution with a pipette to a 1. 5 ml Eppendorf tube. - Clean and burn mesh, using 70 % ethanol, between each Matrigel sample. - Centrifuge the tubes for 7 minutes 300 g. - Remove the supernatant with a pipette and transfer to a clean 1. 5 ml Eppendorf tube. - Prepare the cell-pellet for flow analysis. - Filter the supernatant through a 0. 45 µm filter. - Aliquot the samples in 1. 5 ml Eppendorf tubes (e. g. 50 µl per <b>tube).</b> <b>Freeze</b> immediately at - 70 ° C or below and keep samples frozen until analysis with ELISA or luminex technology. - **Note**: After incubation I *step 7 *, you will still observe some Matrigel clumps in the sample. These clumps are easily meshed through the stainless sieve. After meshing (*step 9 *) you will loose the rest of the Matrigel collagen fibers in centrifugation (*step 11 *) and filtering (*step 14 *). Cytokines in Matrigel extracellular matrix are diluted approximately five times in *step 2 * (1 ml RPMI + ~ 250 µl Matrigel plug). Final concentration is therefore found by multiplying observed concentration with 5. A starting volume of 1 ml RPMI + Matrigel plug will typically give 400 - 700 µl filtered supernatant. ### Timing - **Injections**: - 1 - 2 hours (for 24 Matrigel plugs) - **Collection of Matrigel plugs**: - usually takes 1 - 2 hours depending on the number of mice. Generally, you can expect to spend approximately 5 minutes on each mouse. - **Preparation of the Matrigel samples from water-bath to freezer**: - takes 2 - 3 hours depending on the number of samples. You can expect to use 3 - 4 minutes on meshing one sample + cleaning between each sample. ### Troubleshooting - **Air bubbles in the Matrigel**: - a) As Matrigel is a low viscosity liquid, you should be very careful when mixing it with your cells and injecting it in the mice. - b) Treating it to roughly may lead to air bubbles in the mixture. These air bubbles are very difficult to get rid of once inside the Matrigel solution in the syringe. Air bubbles in the syringe will give you an incorrect injection volume, and may cause the Matrigel to disintegrate once inside the mouse. - c) We have experienced that if you thaw the Matrigel overnight at 4 °C, it will be easier to handle. - **Clogging of the needle**: - a) If the Matrigel/cell mixture reaches room temperature while inside the syringe, it will clog your needle. Keep the syringe and needle on ice before use. - **Very low levels of cytokines**: - a) Cytokines are relatively unstable and generally have a short half-life. To prevent degradation of cytokines in your samples, keep samples on ice as much as possible during preparation. This reduces necrotic cell death and the subsequent release of proteases that may degrade the cytokines. - b) Aliquot the samples before freezing to avoid a reduction in the level of cytokines due to repeated freezing and thawing. - c) When samples are ready, freeze immediately at - 70 °C or below. ### References 1.
