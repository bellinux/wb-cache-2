5|$|After {{turning over}} his non-research duties to Sargent, Goodale, Farlow, and Watson, Gray {{concentrated}} more {{on research and}} writing, especially on plant taxonomy, as well as lecturing around the country, largely promoting <b>Darwinian</b> ideas. Many of his lectures during this time were given at the Yale Divinity School. Liberty Hyde Bailey worked as Gray's herbarium assistant for two years during 1883–1884.|$|E
50|$|In {{the final}} {{level of the}} game, Sepulveda traces the Viral {{infection}} back to its source, which is e-mail spam. After Sepulveda had accidentally flashed an image of his face across the skies of Darwinia, The <b>Darwinians</b> had assumed him to be God. They then re-aligned a portal inside Darwinia {{in an attempt to}} communicate with God. The <b>Darwinians</b> managed to access Sepulveda's computer, downloading several files and eventually downloading the Spam. The e-mails were infected with a very nasty strain of internet virus which corrupted the <b>Darwinians.</b> The player is tasked to destroying the few remaining e-mails.|$|R

This world, Darwinia, was inhabited by a two-dimensional digital life-form called <b>Darwinians</b> and was to become [...] "the world's first digital theme park". In Darwinia, the player eradicated a computer virus that infected the world and threatened {{the life of the}} <b>Darwinians.</b> After this, Dr Sepulveda deemed the world safe again. However, the virus had changed something in the <b>Darwinians,</b> and over time they became more aggressive, dividing into factions and fighting. Now labelled Multiwinians, the tribes continue to fight each other.|$|R

5|$|In the French-speaking {{world in}} his lifetime, Lamarck and his {{theories}} were {{rejected by the}} major zoologists of the day, including Cuvier. However, he made more of an impact outside France and after his death, where leading scientists such as Ernst Haeckel, Charles Lyell and Darwin himself recognised him as a major zoologist, with theories that presaged <b>Darwinian</b> evolution.|$|E
5|$|Saltationism was {{the idea}} that new species arise as a result of large mutations. It was seen as a much faster {{alternative}} to the <b>Darwinian</b> concept of a gradual process of small random variations being acted on by natural selection, and was popular with early geneticists such as Hugo de Vries, William Bateson, and early in his career, Thomas Hunt Morgan. It became the basis of the mutation theory of evolution.|$|E
5|$|This naturalistic {{explanation}} fitted {{well with}} the recent account of evolution by Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Darwin, as outlined in his famous 1859 book The Origin of Species. Because this <b>Darwinian</b> explanation required no supernatural forces, it met with considerable criticism from anti-evolutionists, both in academic circles and in the broader social realm.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} {{to look through the}} history of biology from the ancient Greeks onwards and discover anticipations of almost all of Charles Darwin's key ideas. For example, Loren Eiseley has found isolated passages written by Buffon suggesting he was almost ready to piece together a theory of natural selection, but states that such anticipations should not be taken out of the full context of the writings or of cultural values of the time which made <b>Darwinian</b> ideas of evolution unthinkable.|$|E
5|$|While <b>Darwinian</b> {{evolution}} {{never became}} an issue for northern Presbyterians as most accommodated themselves {{to some form of}} theistic evolution, the new discipline of biblical interpretation known as higher criticism would become highly controversial. Utilizing comparative linguistics, archaeology, and literary analysis, German proponents of high criticism, such as Julius Wellhausen and David Friedrich Strauss, began questioning long-held assumptions about the Bible. At the forefront of the controversy in the PCUSA was Charles A. Briggs, a professor at PCUSA's Union Theological Seminary in New York.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} {{astronomer}} Steven J. Dick at the United States Naval Observatory considered the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact by analyzing events of similar {{significance in the}} history of science. The study argues that the impact would be most strongly influenced by the information content of the message received, if any. It distinguishes short-term and long-term impact. Seeing radio-based contact as a more plausible scenario than a visit from extraterrestrial spacecraft, the study rejects the commonly stated analogy of European colonization of the Americas as an accurate model for information-only contact, preferring events of profound scientific significance, such as the Copernican and <b>Darwinian</b> revolutions, as more predictive of how humanity might be impacted by extraterrestrial contact.|$|E

5|$|Although Fodor {{originally}} {{rejected the}} idea that mental states must have a causal, externally determined aspect, he has in recent years devoted much of his writing and study to the philosophy of language because of this problem of the meaning and reference of mental contents. His contributions in this area include the so-called asymmetric causal theory of reference and his many arguments against semantic holism. Fodor strongly opposes reductive accounts of the mind. He argues that mental states are multiply realizable {{and that there is}} a hierarchy of explanatory levels in science such that the generalizations and laws of a higher-level theory of psychology or linguistics, for example, cannot be captured by the low-level explanations of the behavior of neurons and synapses. He has also emerged as a prominent critic of what he characterizes as the ill-grounded <b>Darwinian</b> and neo-Darwinian theory of natural selection.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Athens, of the 6th century BC, was {{the busy}} trade centre at the {{confluence}} of Egyptian, Mesopotamian and Minoan cultures {{at the height of}} Greek colonisation of the Mediterranean. The philosophical thought of this period ranged freely through many subjects. Empedocles (490430 BC) foreshadowed <b>Darwinian</b> evolutionary theory in a crude formulation of the mutability of species and natural selection. The physician Hippocrates (460370 BC) avoided the prevailing superstition of his day and approached healing by close observation and the test of experience. At this time a genuine non-anthropocentric curiosity about plants emerged. The major works written about plants extended beyond the description of their medicinal uses to the topics of plant geography, morphology, physiology, nutrition, growth and reproduction.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Lethbridge {{published}} The Monkey's Tail, {{in which}} he discussed <b>Darwinian</b> evolution. Although agreeing that the evolution of species was an objective fact, he nevertheless argued {{that there was a}} blueprint for existence and that genetic memory was a reality. In a sequel published in 1969, The Legend of the Sons of God – A Fantasy?, Lethbridge argued that extraterrestrials had been responsible for aiding Earth's evolutionary development. Echoing many of the claims made by Erich von Däniken in Chariots of the Gods (1968), Lethbridge argued that the late prehistoric stone circles of the British Isles had been beacons for extraterrestrial spacecraft. In this, his work has been cited as an anticipation of the Earth mysteries movement that expanded across Britain in the following decade.|$|E
25|$|Differences in {{entrepreneurial}} organizations often partially {{reflect their}} founders' heterogenous identities.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s Glick and J. M. López Piñero {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} a biographical dictionary of Spanish scientists modeled loosely on the DSB. This seems to have been the first “knock-off” of the DSB formula at the national level, {{as far as we can}} discern. Glick was both a co-editor and author of 125 articles, including most of the important figures of the 18th century, the <b>Darwinians,</b> the Freudians, and the geographers.|$|R
5|$|Insects play an {{important}} role in biological research. Because of its small size, short generation time and high fecundity, the common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster was selected as a model organism for studies of the genetics of higher eukaryotes. D. melanogaster has been an essential part of studies into principles like genetic linkage, interactions between genes, chromosomal genetics, evolutionary developmental biology, animal behaviour and evolution. Because genetic systems are well conserved among eukaryotes, understanding basic cellular processes like DNA replication or transcription in fruit flies helps scientists to understand those processes in other eukaryotes, including humans. The genome of D. melanogaster was sequenced in 2000, reflecting the fruit fly's important role in biological research. 70% of the fly genome is similar to the human genome, supporting the <b>Darwinian</b> theory of evolution from a single origin of life.|$|E
5|$|More detail {{was given}} in Darwin's 1868 book on The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, which tried to explain {{heredity}} through his hypothesis of pangenesis. Although Darwin had privately questioned blending inheritance, he struggled with the theoretical difficulty that novel individual variations would tend to blend into a population. However, inherited variation could be seen, and Darwin's concept of selection working on a population {{with a range of}} small variations was workable. It was not until the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s that a model of heredity became completely integrated with a model of variation. This modern evolutionary synthesis had been dubbed Neo <b>Darwinian</b> Evolution because it encompasses Charles Darwin's theories of evolution with Gregor Mendel's theories of genetic inheritance.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} embryologist Gavin de Beer anticipated evolutionary {{developmental biology}} in his 1930 book Embryos and Ancestors, {{by showing that}} evolution could occur by heterochrony, {{such as in the}} retention of juvenile features in the adult. This, de Beer argued, could cause apparently sudden changes in the fossil record, since embryos fossilise poorly. As the gaps in the fossil record had been used as an argument against Darwin's gradualist evolution, de Beer's explanation supported the <b>Darwinian</b> position. However, despite de Beer, the modern synthesis largely ignored embryonic development to explain the form of organisms, since population genetics appeared to be an adequate explanation of how forms evolved.|$|E
2500|$|.....the Jewish view on {{the first}} set of {{questions}} is much closer to the picture painted by adherents to intelligent design than to those who are strict <b>Darwinians.</b> Judaism, as a religion, and certainly Conservative Judaism, sees creation as a purposeful process directed by God, however each individual defines the Divine. This is clearly in consonance with the theory of Intelligent Design. What Darwin sees as random, we see as the miraculous and natural unfolding of God’s subtle and beautiful plan.|$|R
50|$|Darwinia mixes {{elements}} from strategy, action, puzzle, hacker and God games alike, {{meaning that it}} does not fall under a specific video game genre. The player has the ability to run several programs through the Task Manager (a reference to the Windows Task Manager), similar to units used in many real time strategy games. Research allows the player to upgrade programs and weapons, which is critical as the enemy develops. Mission Objectives are given at each location/level, as the player and the <b>Darwinians</b> attempt to wipe out the Viruses.|$|R
5000|$|By 1909, mutationism was a {{distinctive}} rival to Darwinism. At that time, Darwin's mechanism {{of natural selection}} was understood to rely on hereditary blending of abundant continuous variations. However, Wilhelm Johannsen's [...] "pure line" [...] experiments appeared to refute this mechanism. Using true-breeding varieties of beans, each with a different size of seeds, Johannsen showed selection {{could be used to}} sort out different varieties, but selection within pure lines would not produce evolutionary changes, even though pure lines continued to generate the kind of abundant variations that <b>Darwinians</b> saw as the fuel for evolution.|$|R
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{is one of}} the cornerstones of modern biology. The concept, published by Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in a joint presentation of papers in 1858, was elaborated in Darwin's influential 1859 book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, which described natural selection as analogous to artificial selection, a process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favoured for reproduction. The concept of natural selection originally developed {{in the absence of a}} valid theory of heredity; at the time of Darwin's writing, science had yet to develop modern theories of genetics. The union of traditional <b>Darwinian</b> evolution with subsequent discoveries in classical genetics formed the modern synthesis of the mid-20th century. The addition of molecular genetics has led to evolutionary developmental biology, which explains evolution at the molecular level. While genotypes can slowly change by random genetic drift, natural selection remains the primary explanation for adaptive evolution.|$|E
5|$|Stebbins was {{passionate about}} {{teaching}} evolution, advocating during the 1960s and 70s {{the teaching of}} <b>Darwinian</b> evolution in public schools. He {{worked closely with the}} Biological Sciences Curriculum Study to develop high school curricula based on evolution as the central unifying principle in biology. He also opposed scientific creationism groups. Stebbins was active in numerous science organizationsincluding the International Union of Biological Sciences, the Western Society of Naturalists, the Botanical Society of America, and the Society for the Study of Evolutionand served as President of the American Society of Naturalists. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1952. Stebbins received numerous awards for his contributions to science: the National Medal of Science, the Gold Medal from the Linnean Society of London, the Addison Emery Verrill Medal from the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History, and the John Frederick Lewis Award from the American Philosophical Society. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1952. He was awarded the 1983 Leidy Award from the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Systematic botany {{is part of}} {{systematic}} biology, which {{is concerned with the}} range and diversity of organisms and their relationships, particularly as determined by their evolutionary history. It involves, or is related to, biological classification, scientific taxonomy and phylogenetics. Biological classification is the method by which botanists group organisms into categories such as genera or species. Biological classification is a form of scientific taxonomy. Modern taxonomy is rooted in the work of Carl Linnaeus, who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to align better with the <b>Darwinian</b> principle of common descent – grouping organisms by ancestry rather than superficial characteristics. While scientists do not always agree on how to classify organisms, molecular phylogenetics, which uses DNA sequences as data, has driven many recent revisions along evolutionary lines and is likely to continue to do so. The dominant classification system is called Linnaean taxonomy. It includes ranks and binomial nomenclature. The nomenclature of botanical organisms is codified in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) and administered by the International Botanical Congress.|$|E
5000|$|Ward {{is often}} {{categorized}} {{as being a}} follower of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. Ward's article [...] "Neo-Darwinism and Neo-Lamarckism" [...] shows Ward had a sophisticated understanding of this subject. While he clearly described himself as being a Neo-Lamarckian, he completely and enthusiastically accepted Darwin's findings and theories. On the other hand, he believed that, logically, {{there had to be}} a mechanism that would allow environmental factors to influence evolution faster than Darwin's rather slow evolutionary process. The modern theory of Epigenetics suggests that Ward was correct on this issue, although old-school <b>Darwinians</b> continue to ridicule Larmarkianism.|$|R
40|$|Social {{identity}} theory {{offers an}} important lens to improve understanding of founders as enterprising individuals, the venture creation process, and its outcomes. Yet, further advances are hindered {{by the lack}} of valid scales to measure founders’ social identities. Drawing on social identity theory and a systematic classification of founders’ social identities (<b>Darwinians,</b> Communitarians, and Missionaries), we develop and test a corresponding 15 -item scale in the Alpine region and validate it in 13 additional countries and regions. The scale allows identifying founders’ social identities and relating them to processes and outcomes in entrepreneurship. The scale is available online in 15 languages...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1972 Mimicry, obscure colors, and {{secondary}} sexual colors were important classes of observations that {{were analyzed by}} nineteenth century biologists from several vantage points. Adherents {{of the doctrine of}} special creation of fixed species believed animal colors to be evidence of design; Darwin and Wallace and their successors suggested that a natural process, natural selection, had produced the adaptations. Letters to the editor of Nature and discussions at the Royal Entomological Society of London record the controversy between biological world-views. There was, however, little unity between Darwin and Wallace on the development of coloration. Darwin emphasized the sexual function of color which Wallace largely discounted. Wallace emphasized the protective function of color. The source of their differences may be traced to their sources of data. Darwin had relied upon the variations of domestic animals to understand wild species which Wallace believed must be studied directly rather than by domestic analogy. Darwin used sexual selection and the inherited effects of acquired characters to account for most of the cases of dimorphic coloration in animals and of racial colors in man, setting his view of the origin of colors in both animals and man irreconciably apart from that of Wallace. The controversy on the uses of color in animals shows the differences of opinion between <b>Darwinians</b> as well as between <b>Darwinians</b> and creationists, and provides a way of studying some of the distinctive features of nineteenth century biology...|$|R
