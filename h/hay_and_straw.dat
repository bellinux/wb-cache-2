5|$|Many {{members of}} the {{garrison}} tried to sneak aboard Leake's ships to escape the siege. The situation was precarious and was only worsened when a storm damaged many of Leake's ships on 4–5 December. By this time, the garrison was critically short of medicines and supplies. Many were sick or injured and too few remained to carry out repairs to the shell-damaged fortifications. Only 1,300 were healthy enough to man the defences. Their living conditions were increasingly grim; their shoes had worn out and many men wore makeshift sandals made from <b>hay</b> <b>and</b> <b>straw.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{commercial}} {{traffic on the}} waterways continued despite the railway competition, with 44,034 tons generating £733 of tolls in 1888, which enabled the Commissioners to show a profit of £216. Traffic had fallen slightly to 42,640 tons in 1898, but by 1905 was down to 12,770 tons, and the Commissioners showed a loss of £702 that year. An Alderman giving evidence to the Royal Commission on Canals and Waterways in 1905 pointed out {{that one of the}} railway companies had been paying to collect traffic in <b>hay</b> <b>and</b> <b>straw,</b> although this practice ceased when it became public knowledge. The condition of the Nene and the Wisbech Canal declined, which discouraged navigation, but some trade in agricultural produce, coal, bricks and road building materials continued. Coal was delivered by barge from Outwell Depot to around 40 pumping stations.|$|E
5|$|Trade on {{the lower}} river was carried in barges and keels. During the early 1800s as trade was increasing, so the river was {{simultaneously}} silting up. Around 1800, vessels carrying 60 tons could reach the port facilities at Spalding; however, by the 1820s, ships could only be loaded with 40 tons each as the river silting had worsened. Trade records indicate that in 1829, vessels carried just under 20,000 tons to and from Spalding, and by 1835 this had increased to over 34,000 tons. There was pressure from merchants to cater for larger vessels, and with later improvements, carried out under an act of parliament obtained in 1837, barges and sloops of up to 120 tons could use the port. Because the river was maintained for drainage, some commercial traffic continued despite the railways, and tolls of £478 were collected on 11,690 tons in 1888. Coal for Spalding gasworks arrived by boat until the early 1900s, and the last regular trade was the carriage of corn, <b>hay</b> <b>and</b> <b>straw</b> from Spalding to Fosdyke, where the cargo was transferred to larger ships. All commercial carrying had ceased {{by the end of}} the Second World War.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine nutritive value of common animal feed sources in East Azerbaijan province including second cutting of alfalfa <b>hay</b> (N= 35) <b>and</b> wheat <b>straw</b> (N= 26). Chemical composition and mineral contents of alfalfa <b>hay</b> <b>and</b> wheat <b>straw</b> were determined according to standard methods. Then the average chemical compositions of these samples were compared with those of the Gilan, Kurdistan and Kermanshah samples and the National Research Council (NRC) data. The results demonstrated that the mean dry matter (DM) content of alfalfa <b>hay</b> <b>and</b> wheat <b>straw</b> were 942. 4 ± 5. 6 and 948. 7 ± 6. 5 g/kg, and mean crude protein (CP) concentrations were 158. 6 ± 11. 4 and 40. 7 ± 4. 8 g/kg of dry matter, respectively, that showed a significant difference with NRC data. Neutral Detergent Fiber (NDF) content of alfalfa hay was 347. 5 ± 51. 5 g/kg and Acid Detergent Fiber (ADF) of alfalfa <b>hay</b> <b>and</b> wheat <b>straw</b> were 447. 3 ± 39. 2 and 703. 1 ± 5. 55 g/kg, respectively; that showed no significant difference. The content of calcium in the alfalfa hay was 13. 9 ± 3. 5 g/kg that revealed no significant difference with the NRC data. The calcium concentration of wheat straw was 5. 7 ± 1. 4 g/kg, that differed significantly with the NRC data. The gross energy of alfalfa <b>hay</b> <b>and</b> wheat <b>straw</b> were 4100 ± 154 and 3981 ± 126 kcal/ kg, respectively.

The news of the contamination of foods with radioactive substances leaking from the Fukushima nuclear reactors damaged the mutual trust between local food producers, including farmers, and consumers. The source of cesium {{was found to be}} rice straw that had been fed to the animals. A notice from the Japanese government that was sent to cattle farmers after the nuclear accident made no mention of the possibility that rice straw could be contaminated with radioactive materials from the fallout. Beef from Fukushima Prefecture was removed from the distribution channels. Health minister Kohei Otsuka stated on 17 July 2011 that this removal might not be sufficient. The urine of all cattle for sale was tested in order to return those cows that showed levels of radioactive substances higher than the government-set limit to farms so they could be decontaminated by feeding them safe hay. The minister said that the government should try to buy uncontaminated straw and hay {{in other parts of the}} country and offer this to the farmers in the affected areas. All transport of beef raised in the prefecture Fukushima was [...] prohibited after 19 July. The meat of some 132 cows was sold to at least 36 of the 47 prefectures of Japan.

Five men knocked on the door of gunmaker Jovan Janićijević (known as Jovan Đakovac). Jovan was a friend of the Serbian teacher Kovačević in Pristina. As no one opened, in order to cross the wall, three stood on each other. Jovan shot the one peeking into the yard, and the house was riddled with shots, and Jovan's wife was killed. Jovan took his children and broke the wall to his neighbour's house, a friend who was a Turk, and pushed them through the wall. His relative Stojan shot back, halting their attack. Jovan and Stojan defended themselves, while half a day passed with attacks and victims. The attackers left the premises through the Četiri Lule Street, then returned with <b>hay</b> <b>and</b> <b>straws</b> <b>and</b> set the house on fire, which was filled by smoke. Stojan surrendered on the promise of besa, however, he was decapitated, and his head was thrown on the street. Jovan, the only one left, entered the basement when the house broke down.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare some {{mathematical}} models used in vitro gas production technique. Chemical composition including Dry Matter (DM), Crude Protein (CP), Neutral Detergent Fiber (NDF), Acid Detergent Fiber (ADF) and ash contents of feedstuffs were determined. Gas productions were determined at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h incubation times and their kinetics were estimated using the four different mathematical models. The mean square error of wheat grain, vetch <b>hay</b> <b>and</b> wheat <b>straw</b> ranged from 5. 589 - 10. 538, 1. 590 - 9. 668 and 0. 814 - 12. 118, respectively. The adjusted coefficient of determination of wheat grain, vetch <b>hay</b> <b>and</b> wheat <b>straw</b> ranged from 0. 979 - 0. 989, 0. 962 - 0. 992 and 0. 976 - 0. 995, respectively. The Durbin-Watson statistic of wheat grain, vetch <b>hay</b> <b>and</b> wheat <b>straw</b> ranged from 1. 378 - 2. 479, 1. 502 - 2. 928 and 1. 178 - 3. 623, respectively. The best model for the gas production of wheat grain was the Von Bertalanfyy and France functions when MSE and R 2 adj parameter was taken into consideration. The best model for the gas production of vetch is the Von Bertalanfyy function when MSE parameter was taken into consideration whereas the best model for vetch hay was the Von Bertalanfyy and Orskov functions when R 2 adj parameter was taken into consideration. The best model for the gas production of wheat straw is the Orskov, Menke and Von Bertalanfyy functions when MSE parameter was taken into consideration whereas the best model for the wheat straw was the Von Bertalanffy function when the R 2 adj parameter was taken into consideration. The best model for the gas production of wheat grain is the Orskov and Von Bertalanfyy functions when DW parameter was taken into consideration. On the other hand, the best model for the gas production of vetch <b>hay</b> <b>and</b> wheat <b>straw</b> is the Orskov and Menke functions when DW parameter was taken into consideration. There is no 1 st order autocorrelation in errors of wheat grain <b>and</b> vetch <b>hay</b> estimated by four models used in the current study therefore, the four models can be used to fit the individual gas production data measured in different time intervals. Von Bertalanffy function is not suggested to fit the gas production data since, there is negative autocorrelation in errors of wheat straw. As a conclusion, choice of best model should be made on the basis of fitting criteria and feedstuffs since, goodness of fit of model is depended on feedstuffs tested and fitting criteria...|$|R
40|$|Samples of Salvia leriifolia were {{collected}} from Khorasan mountains in different growing stages. Chemical composition, rumen degradability characteristics of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) of Salvia leriifolia whole plant (stem and leaves) in different flowering stages and plant leaves in comparison with alfalfa <b>hay</b> <b>and</b> triticale <b>straw</b> were measured using 4 permanently fistulated steers. CP contents for the whole plant Salvia leriifolia in early flowering, mid flowering and full bloom stage and Salvia leriifolia leaves were 9. 57, 16. 10, 9. 57 and 15. 81 percent respectively <b>and</b> for alfalfa <b>hay</b> <b>and</b> triticale <b>straw</b> were 13. 99 and 3. 85 percent respectively. Rumen degradability measurements of treatments indicated that most parts of these nutrients were degraded during the first 24 hrs of incubation, degradation continued up to 48 hrs with the much lower rates. DM degradability of Salvia leriifolia whole plant harvested at early, mid {{and end of the}} flowering stages after 96 hrs incubation were near to those of alfalfa <b>hay</b> <b>and</b> higher than triticale straw. More than 70 % of CP and 50 % NDF of whole plant Salvia leriifolia were in the form of rumen degradable. Gas production technique also showed that most of the gas production is in the first 48 hour and gas amount for different stages of flowering and plant leaves were between alfalfa <b>and</b> triticale <b>straw.</b> It is concluded that Salvia leriifolia can be regarded as a forage closed to alfalfa hay for ruminants...|$|R

40|$|Fire, {{a natural}} disturbance, regulates species {{composition}} in Fescue Prairie. However, {{little is known}} about the contribution of different regeneration strategies in altering species composition after burning in Fescue Prairie. The present study was conducted to determine if and how fire and associated fire cues regulate species composition in Fescue Prairie through their effects on seedling recruitment. The effects of fire and various fire cues, including smoke, ash, and smoke plus ash on seedlings emerging in the field and/or from litter, 0 - 1 cm, and 1 - 5 cm layers of the soil seed banks were therefore examined. These studies were complimented by a study of testing effects of smoke originated from different plant materials on seed germination and seedling growth of species from Fescue Prairie. Chemical analyses were also conducted to determine whether different active compounds existed in smoke made from different materials, which in turn affect germination and seedling growth differently. Burning increased densities, richness, and diversity of seedlings emerging in the field. This was possibly attributed to direct fire cues of burning. Seedling densities of native forbs and non-native graminoids emerging from the soil seed bank were increased and decreased by burning, respectively. Ash and smoke plus ash increased density of forbs emerging from the soil seed bank. Species composition of seedlings emerging in the field and from the soil seed bank was altered by burning. Complex responses were observed for the effects of smoke on seedling establishment, which depended on the type and dilution of smoke solutions, as well as germination conditions. Smoke solutions partly substituted light requirement for germination of Artemisia ludoviciana. Germination of Cirsium arvense and Conyza canadensis only responded to smoke solutions at 25 / 15 °C, but not at 10 / 0 °C. Diluted smoke solutions increased radical length of Artemisia ludoviciana. Karrikinolide (KAR 1) was in the smoke made from prairie <b>hay</b> <b>and</b> wheat <b>straw,</b> but not in that made from alfalfa. This is the first report that different active compounds existed in smoke made from different materials. Highly concentrated smoke solutions made from alfalfa increased germination and radical length of Conyza canadensis, while the same concentrated smoke solutions made from prairie <b>hay</b> <b>and</b> wheat <b>straw</b> reduced germination of Conyza canadensis at 25 / 15 °C in darkness. Priming in KAR 1 solutions and active fractions obtained from prairie hay and/or wheat straw increased germination of Artemisia frigida, Artemisia ludoviciana, and Conyza canadensis at certain germination conditions. In summary, fire and direct fire cues, smoke and ash specifically, stimulated recruitment of some species, especially early seral species and native forbs, contributing to potential changes in species composition of the Fescue Prairie. Different compounds existed in smoke solutions made from alfalfa as compared with those from prairie <b>hay</b> <b>and</b> wheat <b>straw,</b> showing different effects on seed germination and seedling growth. KAR 1, the most important active compound discovered in smoke, was present in the smoke made from prairie <b>hay</b> <b>and</b> wheat <b>straw,</b> but was not in that made from alfalfa...|$|R
