By juxtaposing the two subject-positions of a scholar who is also an employer and a servant who could otherwise be her informant, we illuminate how each is largely constructed by the interaction, and can ponder {{on how to do}} anthropology better.

There is clear link between folding sequences and discrete projection.

Discrete projection theory [21] quantizes the continuous space Radon transform used for the tomographic reconstruction of images from projected views.

40|$|We {{show that}} absence of {{arbitrage}} in frictionless markets implies a lower bound {{on the average}} of the logarithm of the reciprocal of the stochastic discount factor implicit in asset pricing models. The greatest lower boundfor a given asset menu is the average continuously compounded return on itsgrowth-optimal portfolio. We use this bound to evaluate the plausibility ofvarious parametric asset pricing models to characterize financial marketpuzzles such as the equity premium puzzle and the risk-free ratepuzzle. We show that the <b>insights</b> <b>offered</b> <b>by</b> the growth-optimal boundsdiffer substantially from those obtained by other nonparametric bounds. ...|$|R

Our experimental study covers {{a wide range of}} datasets and update patterns, including histogram maintenance in a shared-nothing environment. Building upon the <b>insights</b> <b>offered</b> <b>by</b> the dynamic algorithms, we also propose a new static histogram construction algorithm that is very fast and generates histograms that are close in quality to the highly accurate (but expensive to construct!)

In contrast to most previous models of relational categorization, which begin by assuming abstract representations and role-filler binding mechanisms, we begin by studying relational behavior in embodied dynamical agents, which results in a wider range of possibilities for relational mechanisms. The mathematical tools of dynamical systems theory are used to analyze the relational mechanism of the best evolved agent, and we then identify some of the <b>insights</b> <b>offered</b> <b>by</b> this analysis...|$|R

Processes at a range of spatial scales are important, from highly local to global, and conventional economics casts some light on which firms are most active and successful. ...|$|R

Accordingly, four new crystal structures of this material were solved, two solvates and two new polymorphs.

40|$|A {{framework}} is summarized which supports {{the planning of}} natural language argument structure. One key aspect of natural argument is {{the order in which}} components are presented. This is in part responsible for both the coherency and persuasive effect of an argument. One means of effecting such ordering is proposed, and an overview is provided of the various classes of ordering heuristics. These heuristics are based upon <b>insights</b> <b>offered</b> <b>by</b> rhetoric texts, psychological research, and a corpus study. Finally, it is demonstrated that such an approach can also contribute to the generation of surface textual features including formatting, punctuation and clue words. ...|$|R

40|$|Directional {{asymmetry}} is a well-documented {{phenomenon in}} research on similarity, metaphor, and analogy. In. this paper, we present an account of this phenomenon based on structural alignment. We propose that {{a major source of}} asymmetry is coherence imbalance: that is, a difference in the degree of systematicity of the relational structures being compared. These claims are tested in three experiments which examine the relationship between asymmetry, informativity, and conceptual coherence. The results support the hypothesis that coherence imbalance is a key factor in directional comparison processes. Further, <b>by</b> incorporating the <b>insights</b> <b>offered</b> <b>by</b> structural alignment, coherence imbalance advances a more functional account of asymmetry...|$|R

40|$|Given the {{importance}} of gender in consumer research, one might expect feminist perspectives {{to be at the}} forefront of critical engagement with consumer behaviour theory. However, in recent years, feminist voices have been barely audible. This paper explores the value of, and <b>insights</b> <b>offered</b> <b>by,</b> feminist theories and feminist activism, and how feminist theory and practice has altered our understanding of gendered consumption. It then argues that postmodern and postfeminist perspectives have diluted feminism's transformative potential, leading to a critical impasse in marketing and consumer research. In conclusion, we suggest that feminist perspectives, notably materialist feminism, might open up fresh new possibilities for critique, and interesting and worthwhile areas for transformative research in consumer behaviour...|$|R
