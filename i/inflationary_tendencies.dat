40|$|China has a {{built-in}} <b>inflationary</b> <b>tendency</b> because of the partially-reformed nature of its economic system.

Whenever the hard budget constraint is imposed on the SOEs, China's dysfunctional financial system would impart a deflationary bias {{to the economy and}} render China a capital exporting country by constraining the growth of aggregate demand to be less than the growth of aggregate supply.

Europe's share of American investments increased from 15% to 28%. The investments were of very high visibility and generated much talk of Americanization. Even so, American investments in Europe represented only 50% of the total European investment and American-owned companies in the European Economic Community employ only 2 or 3% of the total labor force. The basic reason for the U.S. investments is no longer lower production costs, faster economic growth, or higher profits in Europe, but the desire to maintain a competitive position based largely on American technological superiority. Opposition to U.S. investments, originally confined to France, later spread to other European countries. Public opinion began to resent American advertising and business methods, personnel policies, {{and the use of}} the English language by American companies. Criticism was also directed toward the international currency system which was blamed for <b>inflationary</b> <b>tendencies</b> as a result of the dominant position of the U.S. dollar.

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{question}} whether the investments subsidized by the economic stimulus package II („Konjunkturpaket II“) do not only have short-term effects on demand but also long-term effects e. g. on local economic growth. As far as the short-term effects are concerned, {{the case of the}} German state of Saxony shows – with some delay – a rise in local government´s investments. Hence, the time-lag problem inherent in all governmental spending programmes seems to keep within reasonable limits. Up to now there have been no signs of <b>inflationary</b> price <b>tendencies</b> in the construction sector. According to - for example - the „new“ economic growth theory, one ought to be sceptical about the long-term effects of the projects supported by the programme: Even for genuine public intermediate goods the withdrawal effects of financing have to be weighed against the positive effects on private enterprise sector productivity. Furthermore, the effects on factor prices caused by the investment grants might encourage the excess use of physical capital in public production. This sceptical attitude of the theory is confirmed for Saxony by the fact that primarily public consumption goods (sports and leisure facilities) or educational facilities (kindergartens, primary schools), which are of no direct relevance to the local enterprises, are supported by the programme. Investments in vocational training, research and development play only a minor role at the local government level or are explicitly excluded from the programme. Especially because of the incentives to misallocate public resources it is recommended to rely on unconditional grants in future support programmes. Then the local governments could use the grants for either „investments” in human capital (new [fixed-term contract] hires, qualification) or in physical capital, according to their needs. ...|$|R

30|$|One of the {{principal}} goals of monetary policy pursued by Central Banks virtually {{in the entire world}} is price stability (Ekanayake 2013). Understanding inflationary dispositions and its determinants is therefore a critical issue and attracts interest from policy makers and the monetary authorities. Budget deficit is studied for Uganda because theoretically it could be a source of inflation especially with regard to how it is financed. In both the Keynesian and Monetarist frameworks, deficits tend to be inflationary. This is because, in the former, budget deficits stimulate aggregate demand, while in the latter, when monetization takes place, it leads to an increase in money supply, and ceteris paribus, increases the rate of inflation in the long run (Gupta 2013). Ideally, a positive shock to government expenditure should result in a supply-side response.

40|$|Abstract. Health care {{organizations}} are highly labor-intensive; policies designed to stimulate organizational change {{are likely to}} have labor impacts. This paper ex-amines the labor effects of policy change in home health care. Major federal home care policy trends since 1980 have spurred the evolution of the typical home care prov-ider toward greater organizational and market rationality. Greater managerial sophis-tication has introduced changes in managemenvlabor relations. Survey data from the 1986 DRG Impact Study are used to show how the pressure of cost-containment pol-icies has pushed agencies to cut labor costs by increasing workloads, managerial su-pervision, and control of the work process. Research on the effects of recent policy change in health care has to date focused primarily on potential client effects. Labor impacts are rarely examined and are poorly understood at the time that policy is made. Findings in this article suggest that these issues deserve greater, more systematic at-tention, because unanticipated labor impacts may prove to be significant impediments to the realization of intended policy goals.

The Islamic months of Ramadan and Zilhaj have positive impact on currency holdings and negative impact on deposits. Although stylized facts indicate that consumer prices are significantly higher during Ramadan but econometric investigation rejects the upward exogenous shifts in prices during Ramadan. Therefore, structural relationship analyzed in co-integration framework has shown that inflation is not directly impacted by the Ramadan but indirectly through increase in its determinants. <b>Inflationary</b> <b>tendencies</b> during Ramadan are not due to exogenous increase by producers and retailers but possibly due to demand surge in the wake of redistribution of income. The months of June and December have positive effects on deposits and negative effects on currency in circulation indicating the presence of window dressing.

Stochastic Cobb-Douglas production functions for the sugar industry were estimated from which indices of physical capacity utilization rates were obtained. Factors which affect the physical capacity utilization of the industry were investigated. Empirical results revealed that the physical capacity utilization rates in the sugar industry was influenced by the industry’s labour productivity, per capita real GDP, sugar import, federal government expenditure on the sugar industry and the quantity of domestic sugarcane used in sugar production. The result of the regression further revealed that the sugar industry in Nigeria was demand unconstrained but resource constrained. It is recommended that appropriate policy measure that should aimed at expansionary aggregate demand as a means of promoting capacity utilization in the sugar industry should be introduced.

30|$|The task of {{rethinking}} {{must begin}} with an attempt to gain some historical perspective. The social settlements around the place of labour in society that were established {{around the end of}} the Second World War in most of western Europe (somewhat earlier in Scandinavia) included the establishment or consolidation of both welfare states and industrial relations regimes that recognized certain rights of organized labour to participate in settling terms and conditions of work. The two policy fields then went their separate ways. For much of {{the second half of the}} 20 th century the main concern of public policy over industrial relations in western economies was containment of the <b>inflationary</b> <b>tendencies</b> of Keynesian demand management. This presented a number of classic collective action problems, which provided the main analytical frame for academic study (Crouch 1993, Chap. 2; Olson 1982). Wider social policy – once seen as closely linked to labour policy within the general concept of Sozialpolitik – sometimes played a subsidiary role, providing material for deals and bargains, but was mainly seen as a different subject, to be studied with different if related analytical tools. While there was always a diversity of employment statuses, in general that of the full-time, indefinite, dependent employee was becoming increasingly dominant as self-employment and various forms of job tenure associated with agriculture declined. Policy-making in all these fields was largely contained at the level of the nation state; and there was little concern for sustainability issues. Certainly, economic growth was seen as entirely beneficial, and questions were not asked about the environmental impacts of the kinds of activity that produced such growth.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{changes in}} Indigenous employment, income and housing costs {{to identify any}} localised ‘resource curse’ for Indigenous communities and the Australian population at large. Abstract Until the global financial crisis reduced Australian economic growth in late 2008, Indigenous employment had been increasing in both absolute and relative terms for over a decade. The effect of the international economic contraction has been mitigated by Australia’s booming mining sector, largely due to China’s growing demand for resources. Given that {{a substantial number of}} mining operations are on or near Indigenous land, the increase in mining investment may have disproportionately affected Indigenous communities. There are concerns that, in remote mining areas, the increases in housing costs generated by the mining boom mean that anyone who does not work in the mining industry, particularly those who rely on government benefits, will find it harder to afford housing. Localised <b>inflationary</b> <b>tendencies</b> can also affect people employed outside the mining sector, but one would expect that scarcity in the labour market would drive up wages in both mining and non‑mining jobs. This paper examines changes in Indigenous employment, income and housing costs to identify any localised ‘resource curse’ for Indigenous communities and the Australian population at large. The paper draws on data from recent censuses, the geographic location of mines and mining investment to identify some potentially important effects of the mining boom on Indigenous communities. The main finding is that the mining boom has improved employment and income outcomes, but increased average housing costs. While the average increase in income has generally offset the increase in costs, {{there is some evidence that}} housing stress for low-income households has increased as a result of the mining boom...|$|E
40|$|Real GDP in {{the industrialized}} {{countries}} is projected to expand by 2 ¾ percent in both 1995 and 1996. Recovery in Europe is set to continue at a healthy pace without gaining further momentum. Overall output growth {{is unlikely to be}} strong enough as to make substantial inroads into the generally high level of unemployment. High interest rates and fiscal retrenchment dampen activity in the countries with weaker currencies; in the strong-currency area, the recent exchange rate shifts constitute a severe test for these countries' external competitiveness. The international business cycle recovery, which became firmly established in 1994, continues. GDP growth in 1995 is projected at 3 percent for both the U. S. and OECD Europe. The U. S. economy has entered a period of slowing activity, caused by endogenous cyclical factors as well as monetary restriction, and the further course of the cycle is not quite clear. The persistent weakness of the dollar vis-à-vis the DM and the yen has been accompanied by exchange rate turbulence within Europe. The block of hard currencies which has emerged since 1992, has appreciated by some 10 percent in real-effective terms against the weaker currencies. Nevertheless, the rate of economic growth is virtually identical for both groups of countries. It is true that the sizeable devaluations have largely contributed towards pulling the weak-currency countries out of the 1992 - 93 recession and that growth continues to be export-driven to a higher degree than in the hard-currency area. However, domestic demand is considerably dampened by high interest rates and the restrictive stance of fiscal policy. The largely productivity-enhancing export growth and weak domestic demand leave little scope for employment gains. Relatively stronger is the performance of domestic demand in the hard-currency countries, thereby partly offsetting the effects of appreciation on activity. Employment, having fallen markedly less than in the weak-currency countries during the recession, increased steadily, if only moderately, in the early upswing, due to firm domestic demand. Price cuts for imports and the slowdown in domestic inflation contribute towards greater price stability in the hard-currency countries. In the weak-currency area <b>inflationary</b> <b>tendencies,</b> which have so far been reined back by the effects of the past recession, are now becoming increasingly apparent.

40|$|Purpose – While in {{developed}} economies, changes in monetary policy affect real economic {{activity in the}} short-run but only prices in the long-run, {{the question of whether}} these tendencies apply to developing countries remains open to debate. In this paper, we examine the effects of monetary policy on economic activity using a plethora of hitherto unemployed financial dynamics in inflation-chaotic African countries for the period 1987 - 2010. Design/methodology/approach – VARs within the frameworks of VECMs and simple Granger causality models are used to estimate the long-run and short-run effects respectively. A battery of robustness checks are also employed to ensure consistency in the specifications and results. Findings – But for slight exceptions, the tested hypotheses are valid under monetary policy independence and dependence. Hypothesis 1 : Monetary policy variables affect prices in the long-run but not in the short-run. For the first-half (long-run dimension) of the hypothesis, permanent changes in monetary policy variables (depth, efficiency, activity and size) affect permanent variations in prices in the long-term. But in cases of disequilibriums only financial dynamic fundamentals of depth and size significantly adjust inflation to the cointegration relations. With respect to the second-half (short-run view) of the hypothesis, monetary policy does not overwhelmingly affect prices in the short-term. Hence, but for a thin exception Hypothesis 1 is valid. Hypothesis 2 : Monetary policy variables influence output in the short-term but not in the long-term. With regard to the short-term dimension of the hypothesis, only financial dynamics of depth and size affect real GDP output in the short-run. As concerns the long-run dimension, the neutrality of monetary policy has been confirmed. Hence, the hypothesis is also broadly valid.

40|$|The study investigates {{two aspects}} that arise when an {{application}} {{is made for}} building plan approval to the Building Control Officer (BCO) in the Department of Building Control at a local authority (LA). Firstly, the uniform application of the minimum requirements for building plan approval is studied. Secondly, while keeping the original goal of the National Building Regulations (NBR) in mind, the inclusion of passive design requirements is considered {{as part of the}} minimum requirements. In the Republic of South Africa (South Africa), the National Building Regulations and Building Standards Act, 1977 (Act 103 of 1977) determines the minimum requirements of any building. Although the NBR {{are in the process of}} being rewritten, the amended 1990 version is still being used. On 15 June 2010, the South African National Standard (SANS) 10400 -XA: The Application of the National Building Regulations Part X: Environmental Sustainability Section A: Energy Usage in Buildings, was published for public comment. However, the current version of the NBR does not address sustainability. Therefore, it is argued that the planning and erection of structures within the South African built environment do not currently conform to any minimum sustainability requirements. A series of ‘Deemed-to-Satisfy Rules’ constitutes an integral part of the NBR. Should a development in the built environment comply with these prerequisites, it is observing the statutory requirements of Act 103 of 1977. The regulations are implemented by the Department of Building Control of the different LAs (or municipalities). Act 103 of 1977 also prescribes the appointment, qualifications and functions of the BCO who should head the department. However, it is the LA’s responsibility to appoint the BCO. An LA’s Department of Building Control uses guidelines (as determined by Act 103 of 1977) to approve applications for new buildings and alterations to existing ones. A series of prescribed inspections should be conducted during the construction phase of a building. Before a building can be used for its intended purpose, the BCO has to sign a Certificate of Occupancy. Although the NBR provide prescriptions, the requirements are implemented in different ways by the various LAs. After determining the origin and examining the goals and implementation methods of Act 103 of 1977 and its Regulations (together with the Code of Application (SANS 10400 : 1990)), this study demonstrates that the current edition of the NBR is not uniformly implemented in the Republic of South Africa. Additionally, the study links the original goal of the NBR to limit <b>inflationary</b> <b>tendencies</b> with current practice to use passive design principles to combat building operation costs. Lastly, a pro forma application form is included as an addendum (although it is not officially part of the study). This proposed pro forma could assist in the uniform implementation of NBR, while at the same time promoting sustainability. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze empirically the demand structure for the following important farm production inputs in Oregon: hired labor, chemical fertilizer, farm machinery, repairs and operating costs of motor vehicles and other machinery designated as "machinery supplies," purchased feed and miscellaneous inputs. Twenty-year data (1950 - 69 except 1951 - 70 for hired labor) were analyzed with the aid of simple equation least-squares multiple regression techniques for all inputs. In addition, a simultaneous-equation model is applied to hired labor data. The demand for each input is predicted through 1975. This study indicates that hired farm labor employment depends heavily upon wage rates. Contrary to earlier national and regional studies, the short-run demand for hired farm labor in Oregon during 1951 - 70 was found to be elastic, - 1. 2 to - 1. 5 and - 1. 5 to - 2. 6 in the single-equation and the simultaneous-equation demand models respectively. This implies that if farm wage rates rise, the number of workers employed declines in greater proportion than the wage rate rise. Conversely, if wage rates fall the number of workers employed will increase disproportionately. The number of hired workers employed on Oregon farms declined by 40. 6 percent (37 thousand to 22 thousand) between 1950 and 1970. A further 25 percent decline is projected by 1975. The demand for fertilizer and purchased feed are comparable in many ways. The demand for each is inelastic (- 0. 45 and - 0. 58) in the short-run, and moderately elastic (- 1. 05 to - 1. 35) in the long-run. The adjustment coefficient, which indicates the percent of the required adjustment that can be made in one year in feed or fertilizer purchases, in both cases are about the same [...] around 0. 50. However, profitability of livestock enterprises as an independent variable (RL subscript [t]) is statistically significant in the demand equation for purchased feed, but profitability of farming as a variable (R subscript [t]) is not significant in the fertilizer models. Furthermore, fertilizer purchases continued to increase in spite of static or slightly decreasing crop prices. Although the input price variable is statistically significant in the demand models for both fertilizer and purchased feed, decreasing fertilizer prices have probably contributed heavily to the increase in the use of fertilizers in Oregon. If the past declining trend in the "real" price of fertilizer continues and other relationships do not change materially, there will be a 43 percent (381. 8 thousand tons to 547. 5 thousand tons) greater consumption of fertilizer in Oregon over the next six years. Based on past experience, such an increase is undoubtedly within the capability of the fertilizer industry to meet the requirement. The expenditure for purchased feed is projected to be 9 percent greater in 1975 than in 1969 in terms of constant 1957 - 59 dollars. The increase becomes 25 percent when expressed in terms of what feed prices are expected to be in 1975 dollars. Unavailability of data on annual capital outlay for the purchase of machinery and equipment by Oregon farmers is a serious problem in the estimation of the demand structure for farm machinery. However, annual inventories of machinery and equipment on Oregon farms is used as a substitute variable. The analysis indicates the demand for machinery and equipment inventories to be inelastic. The demand for "machinery supplies", a variable with considerable complementarity with machinery and equipment inventory, was also found to be inelastic. A 10 percent increase in the price of farm machinery or price of "machinery supplies" is associated with a 4. 5 percent decrease in the total machinery and equipment inventory, and a 6. 3 percent decrease in "machinery supplies" purchased. The estimated elasticities may be biased due to high multi-collinearity problems in their demand models. However, the prediction ability of these models is undoubtedly good. It is expected that there will be a 32 million increase (1957 - 59 dollars) in the value of machinery inventories on Oregon farms by 1975 over the 1969 level. The increase is 104 million in 1975 dollars. The expenditure for repairs and operating costs of motor vehicles and other machinery (machinery supplies) are expected to be fairly constant during this period in terms of 1957 - 59 dollars. This peculiarity of increasing inventory of machinery and equipment in 1957 - 59 dollars and a constant expenditure for "machinery supplies" is judged to be due to the fact that the machinery inventory effect and the price effect seem to cancel out and maintain the constant expenditure for "machinery supplies. " Prices of "machinery supplies" have tended to decline over the period of the study. The projection of expenditure for "machinery supplies" in terms of current dollars indicates a 12 percent increase by 1975 which is wholly accounted for by expected <b>inflationary</b> <b>tendencies</b> in the economy. In contrast to chemical fertilizer, purchased feeds, machinery and equipment inventories and "machinery supplies," miscellaneous inputs (interest, electricity, veterinary supplies and services, etc.) has a very high elastic demand. Due to the evidence of there being two distinct trends in expenditures for miscellaneous inputs, the data were analyzed on the basis of the two periods. The dummy variable approach developed by Damodar Gujarati fails to reject the null hypothesis of the discontinuity in the demand curve for miscellaneous inputs during the 1950 - 69 period at the 5 percent test level. The mean price elasticity of demand was found to be - 1. 22 for the period 1950 - 57 and - 4. 28 for the period 1958 - 69. Such a high elasticity is probably due to a strong complementarity between miscellaneous inputs and the increasing total agricultural plant size, and the substitution effect due to gradually falling relative prices of miscellaneous inputs. A 23 percent increase (1957 - 59 dollars) in expenditure for miscellaneous inputs is projected by 1975 compared to 1969. The increase in terms of 1975 dollars amounts to 46 percent: from 72. 8 million to 106. 4 million. It is anticipated that the information regarding the demand structure for farm production input factors discussed in this study will be useful to people involved in farm labor policy-making, and decision making in farm supply business firms, credit agencies and farming businesses in planning for the extension of their volume of operations in the next few years. The future demand for these farm inputs, among other factors, will largely depend on the trend of their "real" or relative prices. The projected amount of expenditures for these inputs in current dollars will be modified by any changes in the extent of <b>inflationary</b> <b>tendencies</b> in the economy...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{literature}} {{focuses on}} achieving macro-economic stability by an active {{use of the}} monetary policy instruments. The present study focuses on identifying monetary policy shocks and traces their impact on Pakistanâ€™s economy. To this end, nonlinear policy rules {{have been used to}} be able to use monthly data on monetary variables. We have used the standard SVAR and STAR approaches that are popular in making basic OLS estimation and the simulations in a new-Keynesian type closed economy model. We state identification conditions to reveal the dynamic effects of monetary policy shocks on the non-policy block of variables. For nonlinear analysis we have pursued a general-tospecific methodology whereby, by imposing straight restrictions on the general model, to find the model that is statistically sound and fits the data the best. A threshold regression model comprising three monetary regimes is used for analytical purposes. An important finding of the present study is that a higher-than-normal increase in money supply has had the expected effect of stoking the fires of unusual inflationary episodes. The policy response has been to curb inflation by using different monetary policy instruments namely, manipulation of the key interest rate and changes in the total reserve requirements of the banking system to restrain the <b>inflationary</b> <b>tendencies.</b> The empirical results confirm remarkable differences in the monetary policy transmission mechanism during the three sample periods. We conclude that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) can exercise an effective control on inflation and adjust output growth forecasts in the middle of the three threshold periods identified in this study. We also find that when inflation forecasts are within a moderate range, around the long-run inflation target, the SBP tends to assume an essentially accommodating policy stance with respect to the manipulation of the key interest rate. In general, the monetary authority relies on encouraging demand and supply shocks to restore inflation to its desired long-run level. On the contrary, when inflation forecast tends to fall outside the tolerance range (which according to resent study is 4. 13 to 11. 21), aggressive adjustments in the interest rate can take place. An important implication of our analysis is that only a small proportion of the observed repetitive variation is attributable to random variation in monetary policy and the real effects of monetary policy are smaller than is usually believed. Pakistanâ€™s experience with monetary policy supports the existence of the so-called Price Puzzle namely, that a positive shock to interest rate tends to increase the price level instead of reducing it Yet another finding of the present study is that inflation variability around the central projection can be contained by increasing short run nominal interest rates. The policy implication of this finding is that, with asymmetric output-inflation trade off, a vigilant policymaker would keep the average interest rate higher than the symmetric specification. One more interesting aspect of our analysis is that interest rate based policy has been much more sensitive to exogenous shocks in the period after 1999 - 2000. The policy responses of the SBP during this period have been asymmetric. Under this policy framework the SBP responds not only to current or lagged inflation; it keeps in view expected inflation as well. Another implication is that the monetary authority should extend its objective function to include not only price stability but also output stabilization...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to identify the peculiarities of inflation trends in the context of large import dependence, as well as finding the ways to solve the problems of inflation and import dependence. In this connection, the article discusses in detail such issues as the specifics of inflation processes in the context of globalization, the interrelation between inflation and the foreign trade factor, the interrelation between inflation and the exchange rate. The peculiarities of inflation trends, as well as the interrelation between inflation and import dependence, are examined on the example of the economy of the Republic of Tajikistan. The theoretical basis of the study was the work of foreign, in particular Russian and native scientists on inflation issues in an open economy, <b>inflationary</b> <b>tendencies</b> in the context of globalization, the interrelation between inflation and integration processes, as well as the problems of import dependence. The statistical data of the Agency on Statistics under the President of the Republic of Tajikistan - www. stat. tj, the data of the website of the National Bank of the Republic of Tajikistan – www. nbt. tj were used as the information base for the years 2003 - 2016. Results: The positive and negative influence of the foreign trade factor on the level of inflation in the Republic of Tajikistan has been revealed. The positive effect of the foreign trade factor is the following: in conditions of {{a significant increase in the}} incomes of the population and a lack of domestic production potential, the import helps to reduce the large inflationary pressure that arises from the growth of domestic aggregate demand. On the other hand, the import becomes a factor that covers the domestic commodity deficit because the domestic production of the republic still cannot fully meet the aggregate demand for consumer goods. The negative impact can be attributed to the following: in the context of large import dependence, the increase in the prices of imported goods leads to the transmission of inflation, and there is also a significant impact of the exchange rate of the national currency (somoni) on the value of imported goods and, accordingly, on inflation. The negative consequences can also be attributed to the fact that the high import competitiveness creates barriers for the development of domestic production and acceleration of the import substitution process. Low import-substituting potential significantly reduces the positive effect of the devaluation of the national currency. To effectively use the policy of depreciation of the national currency in order to stimulate the development of domestic production, it is necessary to create conditions for a mobile reaction of domestic production to the devaluation policy. For this reason, there is a need to find the ways to reduce the growing import dependence of the republic. One way to solve this problem can be the timely use of a significant increase in the incomes of the population as a stimulating demand for accelerating the development of domestic production. The results of the research show that today the presence of large import dependence makes the economy of the Republic of Tajikistan vulnerable to external factors and contributes to the emergence of inflationary trends. Large import dependence increases the risk of transmission of international inflation, creates barriers to the development of domestic production, and reduces the effectiveness of the application of the monetary policy in order to accelerate the importsubstitution process.  </p...|$|E
40|$|China’s {{monetary}} policy aims to reach two final targets: a paramount economical target (i. e. price stability) and a less important political target (i. e. economic growth). The main actor of {{monetary policy}} is the central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBC). But the PBC is a non-independent central bank. The State Council approves the goals of monetary policy. Very limited instrument independence means that interest rates cannot be set at the PBC’s discretion, and in-sufficient personal independence fails to insulate central bank officials from political influence. Monetary policy in China applies to two sets of monetary policy instruments: (i) instruments of the PBC; and (ii) non-central bank policy instruments. The instruments of the PBC include price-based indirect and quantity-based direct instruments. Non-central bank policy instruments include price and wage controls. The simultaneous usage of all these instruments leads to various distortions that ultimately prevent the interest rate channel of monetary transmission from functioning. Moreover, the strong influences of quantity-based direct instruments and non-central bank policy instruments bring into question the approach of indirect monetary policy in general. The PBC officially follows the monetary targeting approach with monetary aggregates as intermediate targets. Domestic loan growth and the exchange rate are defined as additional intermediate targets. In an in-depth analysis of the intermediate targets two main issues are primarily explored: (i) Are the intermediate targets of the Chinese monetary policy controllable? (ii) Is a sufficient relationship between these targets and the inflation rate observable? It is then shown that monetary aggregates {{are very difficult to}} control, but they have a satisfactory relationship with the inflation rate. Similarly, domestic loan growth is difficult to control – a fact largely attributed to the interest rate elasticity of loans – while there is a particularly close relationship between credit growth and the inflation rate. The exchange rate as an intermediate target can be controlled through foreign exchange market interventions; {{at the same time the}} exchange rate appears to have a significant relationship to the domestic inflation rate. Discussing the special issue of sterilizing foreign exchange inflows, the study concludes that between 2002 and 2008 not only no costs were incurred by sterilization operations, but that the central bank was actually able to realize a profit through foreign exchange market interventions. Based on this, it is concluded that the exchange rate target has not adversely affected the domestic orientation of monetary policy on the whole. The final part of the study examines whether there are any alternative monetary policy approaches that may be able to describe the policy approach in China; special focus is placed on nominal GDP targeting, the Taylor rule, and inflation targeting. A literature review reveals that the concept of nominal GDP targeting may be able to detect <b>inflationary</b> <b>tendencies</b> in the economy and, in combination with other indicators, it could be a suitable concept to assess the overall economic situation. The author calculates a Taylor rule for China from 1994 to 2008 and concludes that there is no close relationship between the PBC lending and the Taylor rate. The author then designs an augmented Taylor rule expanded to include a credit component (credit-augmented Taylor rule). The study shows that the augmented Taylor rule does not perform much better than the original one, but that it maps high inflationary periods relatively well. This is attributed to direct interventions into the credit markets, which have played a major role in combating inflationary cycles over the past decades. The analysis ends with an introduction of the concept of inflation targeting and an examination of whether this could describe monetary policy in China. It is clear that the PBC does not currently follow the inflation targeting approach, although the Chinese authorities could actually be able to influence inflation expectations effectively, not least through direct instruments such as price controls. The author notes that the PBC indeed had a good track record of fighting inflation between 1994 and 2008, and that this may now indicate a good time to think about introducing inflation targeting in China. The central conclusion of the study is that the proven gradual approach to economic and monetary reforms in China is reaching its limit. To break the vicious cycle that relies on the continuous use of quantity-based instruments to compensate for the ineffective price-based instruments – which in turn arises from the simultaneous use of both types of instruments – a complete shift away from quantity-based instruments is needed. Only then the approach of indirect monetary policy, which was officially introduced in 1998, could come into full play. Chinas Geldpolitik verfolgt zwei Endziele: Ein alles überragendes wirtschaftliches Ziel (d. h. Preisstabilität) und ein weniger wichtiges politisches Ziel (d. h. Wirtschaftswachstum). Der Hauptakteur der Geldpolitik ist die Zentralbank, die People's Bank of China (PBC). Aber die PBC ist eine nicht-unabhängige Zentralbank. Der Staatsrat genehmigt die Ziele der Geldpolitik, und eine sehr begrenzte Instrumenten-Unabhängigkeit bedeutet, dass die Zinsen nicht vollständig nach dem Ermessen der PBC festgelegt werden können. Die ungenügende personelle Unabhängigkeit der Zentralbank schafft es nicht, die Amtsträger dem politischen Einfluss zu entziehen. Der Geldpolitik in China stehen zwei Arten von geldpolitischen Instrumenten zur Verfügung: (i) Instrumente der PBC; und (ii) Politische nicht-Notenbank Instrumente. Die Instrumente der PBC beinhalten preis-basierte indirekte und quantität-basierte direkte Instrumente. Zu den politischen nicht-Notenbank Instrumenten zählen Preis- und Lohnkontrollen. Die gleichzeitige Nutzung dieser Instrumente führt zu vielerei Verzerrungen, die letztlich verhindern, dass der Zinskanal des monetären Transmissionsmechanismus funktionieren kann. Darüber hinaus stellen die starken Einflüsse der quantität-basierten direkten Instrumente und der politischen nicht-Notenbank Instrumente den Ansatz der indirekten Geldpolitik im Allgemeinen in Frage...|$|E
40|$|L'auteur, dans cette étude, se livre à un effort de réflexion {{critique}} sur les caractéristiques du régime canadien de sécurité sociale et sur les problèmes que suscitent actuellement son organisation et ses tendances. There are two {{orders of}} deficiencies in our social security system. The distinction {{between them is}} that one group of deficiencies may be looked upon as being the basic one, while {{the other one is}} in fact the consequence of the basic shortcomings. This distinction is extremely important because, for the coming years, {{it will be possible to}} bring permanent solutions to the problems of our social security only if there is some action on their deep causes. The basic deficiencies divide themselves in two groups: those concerning the conception we have of social security and those concerning its organization. DEFICIENCIES IN THE CONCEPTION OF SOCIAL SECURITY 1) The Nature and the Function of Social Security in CanadaIn Canada there is no agreement yet on a common definition of social security. Strictly speaking, we could do without this common definition if at least there was agreement on what Canadian social security should be and if, in some way, there was available a precise notion of its nature in the Canadian context. Neither would the lack of such a definition have important consequences, if we knew the part we want social security to play in the economy of a country such as ours. 2) Relations Between Private and Public FieldsThis conceptual deficiency not only limits the role of our social security system, but also gives rise to certain confusions, namely in what regards the type of relation which should exist between the public or governmental social security system and private income maintenance and health measures. 3) Social Security in Relation with a General Welfare PolicyThe lack of a precise concept of the real nature of the Canadian social security system may also explain why our social security is not sufficiently integrated to a general welfare policy. In the past there has not been enough preoccupation about the relation which could exist between social security measures and, for instance, a full employment policy. This results in assigning social security with a role the importance of which sometimes becomes so considerable that it ends by putting aside all other responsibilities. Here are two policy recommendations concerning this first group of basic shortcomings. a) First, it is essential that the population and the government adopt a broader conception of social security no longer considering it as being only a means of income redistribution. Social security should be an integrating part of a vast welfare policy, in which the efforts toward full employment, the promotion of hygiene and better housing and the improvement of the level of education should deserve as much attention as the safeguard of a minimum standard of living. b) In the present conditions, because of the nature, the influence and the dimension of social problems, private initiative is definitely unable, due to the weaknesses of its means, to meet all the needs. The government must therefore play a more dynamic and more progressive role in the field of social security. DEFICIENCIES IN THE ORGANISATION OF SOCIAL SECURITYThe second group of basic deficiencies, those of organization, takes the form of a constant lack of a general plan in the elaboration of our social security system and can be accounted for in great part by the above noted shortcomings, as well as by the presence of the following factors. 1) Unsystematical ElaborationFirst the elaboration of our social security system took place in an unsystematical way. It has been built up from a multitude of particular programs which have few or no relations between themselves despite the similarities which could unite them. Moreover, it is administrated simultaneously by diversified governmental departments at the federal as well as at the provincial level. 2) Insufficient Knowledge of the FactsNeither has there always been an adequate knowledge of the facts, of the real needs of the population and of the financial resources and abilities of the Canadian economy facing the new obligations imposed upon it by the gradual extension of our social security system. 3) Ignorance of ConsequencesIn the course of the elaboration of our social security system, the consequences that it could bring about, in the long run, to the population's mentality and behavior have also been ignored. 4) Structural DeficienciesWhile building a social security system, the government could not, would not or even did not want to establish communication media between itself and the population. The government has not sufficiently utilized the advice and experience of some benevolent or civic organizations. Another structural element is missing in our social security system: those organizations and rehabilitation services whose creation should have accompanied the elaboration of certain palliative social security measures, particularly the social assistance measures. The main policy recommendations concerning the so-called « organizational » deficiencies of our social security system are the following ones. a) Federal and provincial governments should establish social research centers or extend their attributions and functions where they already exist. Those centers endowed with a diversified staff, made up of economists, sociologists, statisticians and social workers, could, alone or with the collaboration of universities, furnish a sizeable documentation on all the aspects of social welfare. This research effort would allow the governments to work out a rational policy in which all the significant elements would be taken into consideration. b) The government should, as soon as the necessary information will have been gathered, prepare a general plan for the short and the long run. It would then be possible to decide which orientation Canadian social security would take from now on. It would be known which groups are still to be protected more adequately against the risks of social life. The method of action to be chosen in order to carry into effect all the improvements planned would also appear more clearly. c) It is imperative, while improving our palliative social security system, to set up rehabilitation services where they are missing and to increase the attributions of those already existing. Those services could take many forms depending upon the land of problems to be taken care of. They could be established independently or become a part of the services provided by hospitals or social agencies. d) The government, at any of its levels, should consider the consultation of organizations representative of the population or of given fields of welfare as prerequisite and normal process in the elaboration and working out of new measures. e) The public should constantly be kept informed of the financial burdens which governments have to assume with any increase in social security grants or with any widening of its present coverage. They should also know more than they do now about the <b>inflationary</b> <b>tendencies</b> likely to result from any sudden growth of public welfare provisions. CONSEQUENCESThe consequences of the two groups of deficiencies mentioned above constitute what we may call the current problems of the Canadian social security system. They are easier to detect than the basic shortcomings. 1) An Incomplete SystemOur social security system is incomplete. It is so because its programs are not diversified neither numerous enough and because they are not always adequate. The needs of the population are insufficiently covered. The amounts granted in virtue of many income maintenance and social assistance programs provide most of the time only for a minimum level of subsistence and are revised only occasionnally and in a completely arbitrary way. There is not link between the changing requirements of social and economic life and the level of these amounts. Our social security system also provides more protection to the individual as a citizen than to the family as a component of society; despite some timid exceptions, it is far from giving enough weight to burdens and obligations pertaining to family life. 2) A Palliative SystemAnother obvious shortcoming of our social security system lies in its being almost exclusively palliative and in its dealing only with the more easily perceptible needs. Of course, it is possible thanks to the various social welfare measures, to help the population, but it is done in the least administratively complicated way. Our social security measures are, for the most part, almost entirely negative, that is to say they aim at solving complex and varying problems with financial means exclusively. They are in fact directed to the problems, not to the people. 3) Social Dependency as a ConsequenceSuch an orientation in a social security system does much in bringing about a risk of social dependency for its beneficiaries; this mostly occurs when rehabilitation organizations and services are lacking as much as they are now. 4) A Lack of Respect for the Levels of Social LifeNeither does Canadian social security take enough into account the levels of social and community life. The federal government, while being the governmental unit the farthest from the individual, reaches him more often and more directly in many cases than the provinces which are closer to him. In fact, social security as it is now conceived and organized is liable to bring about an unacceptable national uniformity. After a close examination of the various social security programs, one is likely to get the impression that, in a way, a given type of « Canadian citizen » has been initially imagined, to whom programs have been applied after their conception by civil servants ignoring or neglecting some elementary sociological factors. The last group of policy recommendations deals with some of the concrete problems of our social security measures. a) Provincial responsibility in what regards social security should considerably be increased, since this level of government is closer to the population than the federal government and is in a better position to know its real problems. The federal government should perhaps withdraw from the administration of many present welfare programs. b) A family policy should be adopted and current measures should be modified so as to provide a better protection for the family. It would also be advisable to modify the taxation level through an increase In the basic exceptions for family charges. c) So-called cselective» social security programs should be established in favour of unmarried women having reached 60, of survivors and other similar groups subject to a higher incidence of financial problems. d) Unemployment insurance will have to become again a real social insurance or be definitely considered as an assistance program. Whatever choice is made, it is imperative to put an end to the present ambiguity. e) In the future, pensions and allowances should be regularly revised according to the movements of the cost of living index. It would however be a prerequisite to such a policy that social security grants be based on the real average needs of the groups of the population for which they are entended. CONCLUSIONThe dimension of the task which has to be performed should not lead the government to undertake only one set of reforms at a time. The action must deal simultaneously with the fundamental characteristics of our social security system, its instruments and the measures it comprises. In the past, there has always been a tendency to forget the first two sources of problems, which made the lack of coordination worse. This triple direction of action appears as the essential condition of any lasting improvement in the social security system we are now living with...|$|E
