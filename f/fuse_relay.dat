The paper {{will discuss the}} three types of protection that can be implemented on a distribution feeder. Also, this paper presents an in depth analysis and comparison of the overcurrent, directional overcurrent, and distance protection. Using AutoCAD, a substation???s operating single line was constructed as an example of an actual substation. Also, a ???Protection Assistance??? graphical User Interface (GUI) was created to assist in feeder protection. The GUI will include SEL overcurrent time-current curves, overcurrent relay coordination, <b>fuse</b> <b>relay</b> coordination, mho graph for distance protection, and fault location using Wavelet Transform...|$|E

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyElectrical and Computer EngineeringAnil PahwaNoel N. SchulzMicrogrids with {{distributed}} generators {{have changed}} how {{protection and control}} systems are designed. Protection systems in conventional U. S. distribution systems are radial {{with the assumption that}} current flows always from the utility source to the end user. However, in a microgrid with distributed generators, currents along power lines do not always flow in one direction. Therefore, protection systems must be adapted to different circuit paths depending on distributed generator sites in the microgrid and maximum fuse ampere ratings on busses. Adaptive overcurrent protection focuses on objectives and constraints based on operation, maximum load demand, equipment, and utility service limitations. Adaptive overcurrent protection was designed to protect the power lines and bus feeders of the microgrid with distributed generators by coordinating <b>fuses</b> and <b>relays</b> in the microgrid. Adaptive overcurrent protection was based on the relay setting group and protection logic methods. Non-real-time simulator (NRTS) and real-time simulator (RTS) experiments were performed with computer-based simulators. Tests with two relays in the loop proved that primary relays tripped faster than backup relays for selectivity coordination in the adaptive overcurrent protection system. Relay test results from tripping and non-tripping tests showed that adaptive inverse time overcurrent protection achieved selectivity, speed, and reliability. The RTS and NRTS with two relays in the loop techniques were described and compared in this work. The author was the first graduate student to implement real-time simulation with two relays in the loop at the Burns & McDonnell - K-State Smart Grid Laboratory. The RTS experimental circuit and project are detailed in this work so other graduate students can apply this technique with relays in the loop in smart grid research areas such as phasor measurement units, adaptive protection, communication, and cyber security applications...|$|R
40|$|Computer {{programs}} {{have been developed to}} enable the coordination of <b>fuses</b> and overcurrent <b>relays</b> for radial power systems under estimated fault current conditions. The grading curves for these protection devices can be produced on a graphics terminal and a hard copy can be obtained. Additional {{programs have}} also been developed which could be used to assess the validity of relay settings (obtained under the above conditions) when the transient effect is included. Modelling of a current transformer is included because transformer saturation may occur if the fault current is high, and hence the secondary current is distorted. Experiments were carried out to confirm that distorted currents will affect the relay operating time, and it is shown that if the relay current contains {{only a small percentage of}} harmonic distortion, the relay operating time is increased. System equations were arranged to enable the model to predict fault currents with a generator transformer incorporated in the system, and also to include the effect of circuit breaker opening, arcing resistance, and earthing resistance. A fictitious field winding was included to enable more accurate prediction of fault currents when the system is operating at both lagging and leading power factors prior to the occurrence of the fault...|$|R

The problem occurs {{because there is no}} maintenance system program and the company doesn’t have Standard Operational Procedure (SOP) in maintenance to overcome machine failures resulted in the increase of the downtime value. To cope the problems,  in this paper we used application of SOP and appropriate task maintenance selection using Maintenance Value Stream Map (MVSM) method supported by Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM). Beside task selected among all products that have been produced, there is one machine that gives the biggest profit to the company. The product is feet infusion. Kondia milling machine is one of machines produces the feet infusion that has the longest downtime which was 17, 75 hour during January 2016 until October 2016. RCM consist of Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA), Pareto diagram, decision worksheet RCM, whereas the MVSM describes the maintenance activity. Based on Pareto analysis, the critical components on the Kondia milling machine were the magnetic contactor, <b>relay,</b> <b>fuse,</b> cutter, dynamo and bearing. The result of RCM decision worksheet proposed the appropriate action for the critical components cares. The Standard Operational Procedure (SOP) for the maintenance system on the operation of Kondia milling machine are suggested to the company for getting more significant outcome...|$|R
