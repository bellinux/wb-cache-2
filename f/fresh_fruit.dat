In Japan, fruits consumption distribution shows different pattern due to each fruit have different consumption characteristic and trend of demand. Therefore, it is crucial to understand economic characteristic for each fruit by understanding its price and expenditure elasticity. Present study covers the comparison study for the demand of <b>fresh</b> <b>fruits</b> by Japanese household across all over Japan for the period of 1973 - 1992 and 1992 - 2006.

The demand elasticity estimation was carried out using differentiated double logarithmic demand function. We used SHAZAM software for present regression analysis in this study. Present study have found the demand for <b>fresh</b> <b>fruits</b> by Japanese household are inferior goods and highly affected by the price. Generally, the demand for the <b>fresh</b> <b>fruits</b> by Japanese household is decrease.

40|$|Abstract: The {{fruits of}} Lagenara scerara Standl. (Cucurbitaceae) {{are widely used}} for {{medicinal}} and nutritional purposes in Africa. The health promoting ability of the fruits {{might be related to}} antioxidant properties of its constituents. In this study the antioxidant effect of <b>fresh</b> and dried <b>fruits</b> of L. scerara was evaluated by comparing the 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1, 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging and reducing capacity of ethyl acetate and n-butanol extracts of <b>fresh</b> and dried <b>fruits.</b> The comparison was further emphasized by high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) analysis of the extracts so as to relate activities with their chemical profiles. Results indicated that ethyl acetate (EA) extract of the <b>fresh</b> <b>fruits</b> exhibited higher DPPH radical scavenging activity than other samples. At 0. 01 mg/ml the order of activity was: EA dried fruits (50. 6 %) < Bt (n-butanol) <b>fresh</b> <b>fruits</b> (53. 3 %) < Bt (n-butanol) dried fruits (64. 8 %) < EA <b>fresh</b> <b>fruits</b> (68. 6 %) < Gallic acid (81. 8 %). A slight change of activity was observed at 0. 1 mg/ml, where the order was; EA dried fruits (70 %) < Bt dried fruits (71. 8 %) ≤ Bt <b>fresh</b> <b>fruits</b> (72 %) < EA <b>fresh</b> <b>fruits</b> (81. 6 %) < Gallic acid (88. 5 %). In the reducing capacity assay, Bt <b>fresh</b> <b>fruits</b> extract exhibited higher reducing power than all test samples. The HPTLC chemical profiles of both <b>fresh</b> and dried <b>fruit</b> extracts showed some slight differences. The slight differences in antioxidant activities were justified by the HPTLC chemical profiles of the <b>fruits.</b> Therefore, taking <b>fresh</b> or dried <b>fruits</b> of L. scerara may relatively give similar antioxidant effects. Since the fruits of this plant matures in bulky, then drying, milling and packing the products under hygiene environment can ensure a constant supply of antioxidant supplement...|$|R

5|$|Le dîner (dinner) often {{consists}} of three courses, hors d'œuvre or entrée (appetizers or introductory course, sometimes soup), plat principal (main course), and a cheese course or dessert, sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert.

5|$|On {{a garden}} scale, the berries should be picked when dry and ripe. Commercially, most {{harvesting}} is done mechanically by straddle harvesters.

The blackcurrants are placed into half tonne bins and to minimise stoppage time, some machines have cross conveyors which direct the fruit into continuously moving trailers in the adjoining row. A modern machine can pick up to fifty tonnes of blackcurrants in a day using only one operator and two tractor drivers. The bins should be stored in a cool place.

By the 1840s, ice was being used to transfer small quantities of goods further west across the continent. Eastern U.S. fishermen began to use ice to preserve their catches.

5|$|The 1980s were a {{formative}} decade: {{the increased}} optimism after {{the signing of}} the peace treaty with Egypt in 1979, the economic recovery of the mid-1980s and the increasing travel abroad by average citizens were factors contributing to a greater interest in food and wine. In addition, high quality, locally produced ingredients became increasingly available. For example, privately owned dairies began to produce handmade cheeses from goat, sheep and cow’s milk, which quickly became very popular both among chefs and the general public. In 1983, the Golan Heights Winery was the first of many new Israeli winemakers to help transform tastes with their production of world-class, semi-dry and dry wines. New attention was paid to the making of handmade breads and the production of high quality olive oil. The successful development of aquaculture ensured a steady supply of fresh fish, and the agricultural revolution in Israel led to an overwhelming choice and quality of <b>fresh</b> <b>fruit,</b> vegetables and herbs.|$|E

5|$|There {{are a few}} greenish Stropharia {{with which}} S.caerulea might be confused. Stropharia pseudocyanea is an {{uncommon}} species that grows in meadows. It has a more slender form than S.caerulea, a soft, spongy stipe, and flesh with an odour similar to fresh pepper. Microscopically, it has a dense palisade of slender, capitate (with a spherical tip) non-staining cheilocystidia on the gill edge. This gives the gills of young, <b>fresh</b> <b>fruit</b> bodies a whitish edge, a feature that is absent from S.caerulea. Another lookalike, S.aeruginosa, is less common than S.caerulea. It is distinguished from the latter by the well-developed ring zone on its stipe, darker gills with white edges, and more numerous whitish scales around the cap margin. Additionally, S.aeruginosa has more stable colours than S.caerulea, the colouration of which tends to quickly wash out. However, collections of Stropharia often show characteristics that are intermediate between two or more species, making them difficult to identify accurately.|$|E
